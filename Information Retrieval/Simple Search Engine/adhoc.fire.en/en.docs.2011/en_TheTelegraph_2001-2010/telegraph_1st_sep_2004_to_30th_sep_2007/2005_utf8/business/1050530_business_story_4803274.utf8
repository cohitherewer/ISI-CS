 Immelt: The Indian dream

 New Delhi, May 29: Global major General Electric (GE) has offered ONGC its latest power generation plants that can be installed at well-heads and offshore processing platforms.

 GE chief executive Jeffrey Immelt held discussions on Thursday with ONGC chairman Subir Raha and his team on this cutting-edge IGCC technology that enables the new integrated power plants to use either gas or crude oil as fuel for generating power. 

 A senior ONGC official told The Telegraph that the plants could be set up in the oil and gas fields in Assam and Tripura where electricity shortage is a major hurdle in oil exploration and production. Since these plants can run either on crude or natural gas, the fuel for generating power is available on the spot, which lowers the cost. 

 Similarly, the gas processing platforms in the western offshore fields can also be equipped with these power plants. 

 However, the price tag of these plants will ultimately determine whether ONGC can actually go in for the offer.

 Sources said Indian Oil Corporation had also considered this technology for the grassroots Paradip refinery, but the prohibitive cost involved had forced them to opt for a conventional captive power plant. 

 GE is now reported to be thinking on ways to bring down the cost so that the technology becomes marketable.

 ONGC has an annual budget of $3.5 billion for its capital expenditure and GE appears to be looking for a bigger chunk of this cake. Apart from buying new equipment, the oil major has to undertake a lot of maintenance work on its existing equipment at the well-heads, processing platforms and pipeline operations.

 The ONGC official said GE is currently operating through a number of middle-men and often when tenders are floated, there are two or more representatives who have put in a bid for GE. This complicates issues and increases the time involved in awarding contracts and slows down ONGC?s project work. 

 During talks with Immelt, ONGC proposed that GE should deal directly with it and could even set up an office in India if need be. 

 ?Removing the middle-men would also lead to more economical rates for various projects in so far as these end up pocketing handsome commissions,? he said. 

 The GE chief, who considers both India and China as emerging markets, is looking for a stronger presence in the two Asian giants. He said for GE, it is not a question of either India or China. Both are equally important.

 He is reported to have asked the ONGC chairman about the growth prospects of Indian oil companies in the current scenario of controlled domestic prices of petroleum products amid skyrocketing international rates.

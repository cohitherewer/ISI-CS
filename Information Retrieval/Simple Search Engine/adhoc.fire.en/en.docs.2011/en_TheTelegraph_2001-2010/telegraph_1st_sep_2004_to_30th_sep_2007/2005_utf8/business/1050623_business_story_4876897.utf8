 Jay Shree Tea eyes gardens in Assam

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Calcutta, June 22: Jay Shree Tea amp; Industries Limited, a BK Birla group company, is eyeing gardens in Assam to expand its operations in North India.

 The companys focus will be on north India rather than the south in the coming years. It has already disposed of one of its gardens in the south ? Merchiston Estate in Kerala ?due to operational difficulties.

 The focus of the company will be on quality. We are looking at Assam as tea from the gardens in the state fetch good prices at the auctions as well as in the international markets. If we get quality estates at good prices we will buy. We are open to the idea of acquiring more than one garden in Assam, senior officials of the company said.

 The company has five tea estates in Upper Assam ? Towkok, Manjushree, Mangalam Nahorhabi and Meleng.

 It also has five estates in Cachar, two each in Darjeeling, Dooars and Tamil Nadu. The projected total production is 20 million kg in the current financial year.

 The companys Darjeeling tea gardens have been approved for inclusion under the Darjeeling Agri-Export Zone of the ministry of commerce. This will help the company get certain benefits in the form of duty waiver. 

 The packet tea operations of the company is facing a tough time because of regional packeteers in the market. In 2004-05, the company had maintained the sale of packet tea at its previous years level. Jay Shree Tea is strengthening its marketing wing to increase its presence in exports and packet tea segment, senior officials of the company added.

 The company had exported tea worth Rs 22 crore in 2004-05 against Rs 14.69 crore in the previous year.

 The company is optimistic that production will be better this year as the weather conditions are favourable for higher production in India. 

 Moreover, world production should be lower because of unfavourable weather reports from major tea producing countries in the world.

 Jay Shree Teas chemicals and fertilisers business, which has units at Khurdah and Gurgaon, is badly affected by high cost of raw materials like rock phosphate and sulphur. 

 Infotech business suffers

 Jay Shree Teas infotech business has not got off to a good start. 

 Jay Shree Infotech Consultants has not been able to make much headway due to high attrition rate of employees in the industry and tough competition from established players in the field. 

 The company had set up an international call centre at software technology park at Salt Lake. 

 Senior officials of the company said that with no dearth of business in the pipeline, efforts are on to stabilise the activities for improved performance.

 Wal-Mart to control Japanese retail firm

 New owner

 Tokyo, July 5 (Reuters): Wal-Mart Stores Inc will make Japanese affiliate Seiyu Ltd a subsidiary this year, taking over the struggling retailer and stepping further into the Japanese market, the Nihon Keizai business daily said on Tuesday. 

 The paper said the worlds biggest retailer will buy new shares in loss-making Seiyu, Japans fourth-largest retailer, to raise its stake to over 50 per cent from 42.4 per cent. 

 The report sent Seiyus shares up as high as 13 per cent in Tuesday trade and helped lift other retailers. 

 Seiyu is a big topic for the market today, so thats helping to draw attention to retailers, said Toshihiko Matsuno, assistant general manager of investment research at SMBC Friend Securities. 

 Whether Wal-Marts business style can succeed in Japan is another story altogether ...

 Wal-Mart and Seiyu both said no decision has been made, but the US giant, which has been providing management and operational guidance to Seiyu, reiterated its plan to continue to work with Seiyu to improve the Japanese companys performance. 

 Wal-Mart waded into Japans notoriously competitive and fickle retail market, the worlds second-largest, in 2002 by taking 6 per cent of Seiyu, and it has gradually raised its stake since. 

 However, it faces hurdles such as complex distribution channels and picky consumers that have prevented other large Western retailers from achieving any major success. 

 French supermarket chain Carrefour announced its exit from Japan last March after just four years. 

 Wal-Marts partnership with a Japanese retailer has been seen as a better way to enter the market than going it alone, as Carrefour did.

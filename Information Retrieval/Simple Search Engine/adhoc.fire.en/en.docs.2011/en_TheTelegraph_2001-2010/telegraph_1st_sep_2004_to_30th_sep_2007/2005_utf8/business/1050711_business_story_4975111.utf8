 Posco considers port away from Paradip

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Floating a new idea

 Bhubaneswar, July 10: Pohang Steel Company (Posco) may not use the Paradip port for its proposed 12-million-tonne steel plant.

 Though Posco initially selected Paradip as the site for the plant, it is not willing to use the existing port facilities. Instead, the company is considering setting up a minor port at Jatadhari, about 7 km from Paradip, sources said.

 The memorandum of understanding signed between the state government and Posco has provisions that the company may develop a new minor port adjacent to the existing one at Paradip. According to the agreement, the Orissa government has to provide the necessary infrastructure and logistic support to Posco.

 The Korean company needs a dedicated port facility to handle huge volumes of ores and minerals for the Rs 52,000-crore project.

 Though Posco had explored possibilities of developing the Paradip port, it found that setting up a new minor port was more feasible.

 The state government is keen on a new minor port at Jatadhari because of revenue considerations, sources said.

 A minor port will be under the administrative control of the state government. Moreover, the entire revenue benefits will go to the state exchequer.

 The new port may be constructed on a build-own-operate, build-operate-transfer or build-own-operate-share-transfer basis. 

 Meanwhile, the state government is already facing opposition from political parties for recommending a special economic zone (SEZ) status for the Posco plant.

 If Posco is awarded a SEZ status, it is expected to get a few thousand crore rupees in tax rebates, alleged state BJP president Juel Oram.

 Critics say Poscos claim of generating a revenue of over Rs 1,11,000 crore seems far-fetched as the company stands to gain huge tax benefits from the SEZ status promised to it.

 The MoU claimed that the plant will help the Centre garner Rs 89,000 crore and the Orissa government Rs 22,500 crore over 30 years.

 The SEZ status will allow the Posco project to derive the benefits of no-licence for imports and exemption from customs duty on import of capital goods, raw materials, consumables and spares. 

 The status will also exempt it from the central excise duty on procurement of capital goods, raw materials and consumable spares from the domestic market.

 Trai asked to bare BSNL accounts

 New Delhi, March 31: Private telecom operators have asked the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) to come out with the accounts of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) to have a meaningful discussion on the interconnect usage charges (IUC).

 Operators pay IUC to each other to transmit and receive calls from their networks.

 Operators have been claiming that BSNL?s accounting of IUC, which other telecom firms owe it, are not clear.

 The Cellular Operators? Association of India (COAI) has sought transparent sharing of BSNL accounts, in accordance with Trai?s accounting separation guidelines.

 Trai?s consultation paper, issued early March, deals with access deficit charges (ADC), which is linked with IUC charges. Each STD and ISD call received by operators on their network has an in-built cost, which goes into the ADC kitty, while the rest is retained by the operator.

 In a letter to Trai, COAI has said, ?We would like to provide meaningful inputs in order to arrive at an ADC quantum that meets the social telecom objectives of the country, while not over-burdening the existing and other users of telecom services.?

 ADC is paid by operators if they are unable to meet their licence obligations to offer rural connections. The charge is paid to operators who manage to do the job on their behalf. BSNL collects most of the ADC as it is among the few firms serving rural telephone users. 

 In the introduction to the consultation paper, Trai has said the interconnection framework, and in particular, interconnection pricing, has a fundamental impact on the dynamics of effective competition in this sector.

 COAI director-general T. V. Ramchandran said, ?In the last two years, the previous reviews have relied significantly on approximations of indicative/sample data made available by the incumbent for the purpose of arriving at the quantum of ADC. Further, there has been no sharing with various stakeholders of post-facto reviews, if any, of the exact quantum of ADC collected vis-?-vis the envisaged amount.?

 He said access deficit charges constitute a substantial portion of the industry revenues.

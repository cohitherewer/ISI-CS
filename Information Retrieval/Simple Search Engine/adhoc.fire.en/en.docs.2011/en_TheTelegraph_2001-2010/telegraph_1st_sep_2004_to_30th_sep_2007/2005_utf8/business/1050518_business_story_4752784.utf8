 Customised HP printer for local customer

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 17: Hewlett-Packard India will introduce personal printers designed specifically for the Indian consumers. HP will use India as a test base to promote the product in similar markets in other countries. 

 We have started bringing in products that are customised for the Indian user. We are using India as a testing ground for printers in the entry, mid and high-end segments. The products will be further developed for other emerging markets like Brazil, said S. Rajiv Rao, HP Indias country category manager for personal printing.

 The company has charted a three-pronged strategy to consolidate its position in single-function and multi-function inkjet printers.

 In the last quarter of 2004 (October-December), HP enjoyed a 59 per cent share of the single-function inkjet market and 83 per cent of the multi-function one in India, said Rao. We have high growth expectations from both segments and want to consolidate our presence further.

 HP is also planning to launch a range of products, particularly targeting the home, SOHO (small office home office) and micro users. The products will be developed and designed in the US, but manufactured in Asia to meet specific customer requirements.

 The firm would set up 500 demo centres across the country for a wider interaction with customers, Rao added.

 We plan to fortify the channel structure to offer a better experience to customers. Our strategy for the Indian market include special training and demo sessions, local country call-centre, Internet and e-support. An India repair centre will be an integral part of our customer support strategy, he said.

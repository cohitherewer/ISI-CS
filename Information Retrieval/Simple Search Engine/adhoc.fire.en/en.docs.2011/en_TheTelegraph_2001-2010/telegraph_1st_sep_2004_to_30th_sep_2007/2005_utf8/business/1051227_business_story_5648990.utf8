 Sasken may take Rs 7cr hit

 New Delhi, Dec. 26 (PTI): After having lost a case to one of its customers 3g.Com in an international tribunal, Sasken Communications is likely to take a hit of Rs 7 crore in its profit for the current quarter ending December 31 and ruled out any further impact on the margin.

 The amount of the award and expenses, totalling about Rs 70 million, is likely to be charged against the profits of the current quarter. There will be no further impact on margins or EPS (earnings per share) on account of this award, Bangalore-based Sasken today informed the BSE.

 Even if the company has insurance cover for such eventualities, in the present instance, the insurer has cited technicalities for non-fulfilment of the claim, it said, adding that the company is in dialogue with the insurer.

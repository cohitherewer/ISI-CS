 Dollar on recovery run against euro

 London, Jan. 3 (Reuters): The dollar rose slightly in the first trading session of 2005 on Monday, gaining more than a cent from recent record lows against the euro as investor selling paused ahead of US economic data this week. However, analysts said persistent imbalances in the US economy will continue to weigh on the dollar in 2005 after pushing the euro up about 8 per cent to record highs last year.

 Later on Monday, the US Institute of Supply Management?s manufacturing survey is due. A Reuters poll forecast the index for December would edge up to 58.1 from 57.8 in November. US non-farm payroll data is due on Friday.

 ?The market has been so negative versus the dollar that we would need a very poor outcome on the data to hurt it. Otherwise, people will say ?we already sold the dollar?,? said Peter Fontaine, currency strategist at KBC in Brussels.

 ?So the dollar is torn between two stories, one in the short term, ahead of the data, and the other long-term. In the long-term, we still have problems, the current account and trade deficits in the US.? 

 Fontaine added that currency trading was erratic on Monday, with markets in Tokyo and London closed for holidays. At 0915 GMT, the dollar traded at $1.3530 per euro, a quarter of a per cent up from its December 31 close. Earlier in the session, it rose as far as $1.3389 compared with last week?s record low of $1.3667. 

 The dollar was also a quarter per cent up at 102.76 yen and 1.1410 Swiss francs. This compared with last week?s nine-year low against the franc and its lowest level since January 2000 against the yen set in December last year. 

 Europe shares rally

 European shares got off to a sparkling start of the New Year, rallying to a 30-month high on Monday after a broad rebound of the dollar lifted exporters such as car giant DaimlerChrysler.

 Skis Rossignol was among a trickle of corporate features, its shares jumping 11.6 per cent after French newspaper Les Echos reported Quiksilver was looking to buy the French sports clothing maker.

 Bengal rushes to tie up coal for power

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL 

 Calcutta, Dec. 11: Bengals state commerce and industry ministry has started lobbying the Union coal ministry for supply commitments to power plants that have been planned in the state by CESC and Bengal Emta. 

 CESC has submitted a proposal for a 1000-mw unit at Haldia, which might cost around Rs 4,000 crore. Bengal Emta, too, has lined up a 500-mw unit. The power ministry has already cleared the two plants, along with their coal linkages. We have sent letters to the commerce and industry department for taking up the issue with the coal ministry, sources in the power ministry said.

 CESC has applied to the ministry for coal blocks. We are in touch with the ministry for having these blocks allotted to us. But it takes time. We have learnt that the ministry might assign some blocks to private firms by the end of this month. A push from the Bengal government will help us in the process, a senior CESC official said. 

 The RP Goenka flagship is yet to receive environmental clearance for its third unit at Budge Budge ? a 250-mw plant in which Rs 1000 crore will be invested. Loans from banks and financial institutions for the project, which will have equity of Rs 300 crore equity and debt of Rs 700 crore, have been already arranged.

 We want more investments in the state. New plants are welcome as the demand is growing rapidly. But coal is an important raw material and, therefore, it is necessary to get captive supply for the new plants. At our level, we are trying to ensure that supplies of the key input are in place, state power secretary Sunil Mitra said.

 The government is also eager to see CESCs proposed power plant go on stream quickly. The firm has signed an understanding for setting up a 1000-mw power plant in Jharkhand. It has also been in talks with the Orissa government for a 2000-mw venture.

 An investment promise by Sajjan Jindal slipped out of Bengal as the Jharkhand government did not allow his company to procure iron-ore for a steel unit planned here. We want to ensure that no such thing happens. We would like to see CESCs Haldia plant come up quickly, a senior official of the industry department said.

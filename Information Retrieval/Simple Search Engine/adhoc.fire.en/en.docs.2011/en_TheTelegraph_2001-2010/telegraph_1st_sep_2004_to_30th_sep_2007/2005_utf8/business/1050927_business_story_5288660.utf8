 Recipe to attain 12% industry growth

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New plans

 New Delhi, Sept. 26: The high-powered council, set up by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to look into the constraints stifling the manufacturing sector, has recommended tackling the power shortage plaguing the country immediately and liberalising labour laws to achieve a 12 per cent industrial growth rate.

 It is also in favour of dismantling the inverted duty structure and expressed concern over free trade agreements with other countries, which were hitting the domestic manufacturing sector.

 The draft report of the National Manufacturing Competitiveness Council has identified around 10 constraints. The infrastructure bottleneck in power figures on the top of the list and labour issues have been put on a high priority. The report calls for putting an end to the inspector raj in the states that continues to stifle the growth of the manufacturing units.

 Council chairman V. Krishnamurthy said a 12 per cent growth in manufacturing was essential to tackle the nations employment problem with 10 million people expected to join the workforce every year. A 12 per cent growth will create 1.6-2.9 million direct jobs annually, he added.

 He pointed out that manufacturing in India accounted for only 17 per cent of GDP unlike China where it was 35 per cent, 31 per cent in Malaysia and 34 per cent in Thailand. Even Indonesia was ahead of India with a 25 per cent contribution to its GDP from manufacturing.

 Regarding labour reforms, Krishnamurthy said, We are not asking the amendments to the industrial disputes act, which the Left parties are opposing, to be carried out first.

 However, there were other issues like the contract labour act, which could be attended to immediately, he added.

 He said downsizing and restructuring of the workforce was already taking place without amendments to the industrial disputes act. There is a need to attend to welfare aspects of workers to make trade unions amenable to labour reforms, he said. 

 Pointing out that the entire indirect tax structure needed to be revamped, the panel said an inverted duty structure was hitting the domestic manufacturing sector hard. This was compounded by the free trade agreements, it added.

 The panel has also proposed separate studies of sectors like textiles, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, electrical goods and electronics, food processing and leather and handicrafts, which had immediate potential to gain a major share of the global market.

 The council, which went into generic problems like power shortage in the last 7-8 months, will bring out a paper on what needs to be done to deal with the infrastructure bottleneck, Krishnamurthy said. Only a strategic paper has been presented and sector-specific solutions would follow after recording inputs from various quarters, he added.

 He said a major constraint for the manufacturing sector was too many independent agencies. He also cited the example of the food processing sector, which is being handled by eight ministries despite having a separate ministry.

 The panel proposes to hold talks with states to deal with problems faced by manufacturers at the state-level as appropriate reforms were required to improve the investment climate and do away with multiplicity of inspections.

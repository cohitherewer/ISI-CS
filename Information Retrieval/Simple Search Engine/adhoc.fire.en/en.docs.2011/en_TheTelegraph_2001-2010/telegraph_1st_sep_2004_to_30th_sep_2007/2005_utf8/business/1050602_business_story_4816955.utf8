 No interim relief to Bajaj

 New Delhi, June 1 (PTI): The Supreme Court today declined an interim relief to Bajaj Auto, which sought to restrain the Firodias from changing Bajaj Tempos name to Force Motors.

 However, a bench comprising Justices P. V. Reddi and Arijit Pasayat directed that the hearing on the writ petitions filed by Bajaj Auto in Mumbai High Court be expedited.

 Bajaj Auto had approached the Supreme Court challenging Mumbai High Courts May 3 interim order. 

 The order had rejected Bajajs contention that any move to change the name of the company should be through a special resolution and not an ordinary one as was being adopted by the Firodias.

 Bajaj holds 24 per cent in the company and had earlier tried to restrain the Firodias from changing the name by approaching the ministry of company affairs.

 Bangalore, March 8: Honda Siel Cars India Ltd (HSCI) will ramp up its capacity this year to meet the demand in the premium and luxury car segments.

 President and CEO H. Yamada said the company would roll out 50,000 cars a year by October, up from 30,000 at present through a Rs 50-crore expansion at its Surajpur plant. 

 ?To sustain our 100 per cent sales growth this year, we have decided to expand our production capacity by about 65 per cent to roll out more units of our three premium models of the New City, Accord and CR-V. The rise in capacity will reduce the waiting period for our highest selling model, the New City,? he said.

 The company?s investment in the Indian operations will increase to Rs 600 crore with the release of Rs 50 crore for capacity expansion.

 During calendar year 2004, HSCI sold 35,414 cars, registering an increase of 110 per cent over sales in 2003. 

 Sales in the premium segment jumped to 22 per cent from 15 per cent in 2003. 

 Yamada said, ?We are aiming for the number one position in the premium segment of the Indian passenger car industry.?

 Of Honda?s three models, 30,834 units of the New City sold last year. 

 ?The New City commands around 27 per cent market share in the C segment. Similarly, Honda Accord continued to lead the list of luxury sedans with a market share of 40 per cent on a total sale of 2977 units in 2004,? Yamada said. 

 The CR-V has also emerged among popular cars in the SUV segment with a 35 per cent market share.

 To strengthen its distribution network in south India, the company has opened its second dealership in Bangalore. It plans to extend the list of dealers from 42 to 51 this year.

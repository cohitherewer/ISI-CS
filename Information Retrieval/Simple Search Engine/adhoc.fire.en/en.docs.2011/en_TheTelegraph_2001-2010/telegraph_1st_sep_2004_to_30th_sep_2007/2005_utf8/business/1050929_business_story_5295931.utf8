 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Sept. 28: Eveready Industries India Limited, the BM Khaitan group company, has garnered Rs 72 crore from the sale of its assets in Chennai.

 The company has sold 2.2 lakh square feet of built-up area in the complex to be developed as an information technology park on its land at Guindy near Chennai. The IT park is being developed by Khivraj Tech Park.

 The money generated from the sale of the assets will add to the cash flows of the company, managing director and executive vice-chairman Deepak Khaitan said.

 Asked if Eveready plans to deploy the funds for further acquisition, Khaitan said, It is too premature to comment. I have not received the entire money from Khivraj Tech Park till now.

 Khivraj Tech Park will make an upfront payment of Rs 15 crore and the balance Rs 57 crore will come in by March 2006.

 The 8.39-acre land at Guindy was released after the company decided to shift the entire battery manufacturing units at industrial estate at Guindy to Tiruvottiyur High Road in North Chennai and integrate the same with the facilities there. The integrated plant has a total capacity of 450 million batteries.

 Eveready then entered into an agreement with Khivraj Tech Park for developing the IT Park. Khivraj Tech Park also made an upfront payment of Rs 25 crore and it was also decided that 20 per cent of the total built-up area (10 lakh square feet) of the IT park.

 The IT park has been christened as Olympia. Olympia will comprise three towers, Citrus, Altius and Fortius.

 The IT park will be ready by March 2006. Following the sale of this 2.2 lakh square feet of built-up area, we will be completely out of the project, Khaitan said.

 The Rs 220-crore project is being built in phases. The first phase, in which 6 lakh square feet of space will be on offer, is expected to be operational by December 2005. 

 Khaitan said the entire space in the park has been sold out. All the big names in the IT sector like Verizon and Hewlett-Packard have booked spaces in the park. Chennai has become a hub of high-value IT services in the country. Eveready is looking at opportunities to unlock the value of similar assets in the future.

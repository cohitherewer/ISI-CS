 Winds of change at Swiss Air 

 Ready to Fly

 Frankfurt, June 3 (Reuters): German airline Lufthansa is moving closer to full control of Swiss International Air Lines after a large number of small shareholders parted with stock in the Swiss flag carrier.

 The German company is paying as much as 310 million euros ($380 million) to take control of the Swiss firm in stages over the next two years, a step in the industrys consolidation.

 Lufthansa and the Almea Foundation now own 96 per cent of Swiss Air. They have offered small shareholders the option to continue to sell their stock at unchanged conditions.

 Lufthansa owns 11 per cent of AirTrust, a company set up to allow it to take over Swiss Air in stages without jeopardising traffic rights, which are governed by ownership rules.

 The rest is owned by the Almea Foundation, set up by the leading Swiss Air owners, including the Swiss state.

 Switzerland-based Air-Trust now holds 84.6 per cent in Swiss Air from the major Swiss investors, while minority shareholders had offered to sell 11.4 per cent of Swiss shares to it.

 The remaining shareholders, holding less than 5 per cent in Swiss Air, will be given 10 trading days from June 9 to 22 to offer their stock to AirTrust at an unchanged price of 8.96 francs per share.

 Under Swiss law, AirTrust might now consider a squeeze-out to buy up any stock not tendered. Investors welcomed the news, pushing Lufthansa shares up 0.8 per cent to 10.38 euros at 0819 GMT. 

 The stock outpaced a 0.2 per cent firmer DAX-30 index, while thinly-traded Swiss Air shares were up 0.1 per cent at 8.92 francs.

 The Swiss takeover is coming along faster than expected, said analyst Juergen Pieper at Bankhaus Metzler.

 He said airline shares in general were supported by gains in US carriers after Continental Airlines posted stronger-than-expected May traffic figures and by a slide in crude oil prices, which are a gauge to jet fuel costs. He rates Lufthansa stock a buy with a 13-euro price target. 

 The takeover is on track and the small risk that there would be problems with the minority shareholders looks like it has gone, said an analyst.

 Paper museum on the cards

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 28: The paper industry associations of the country are keen on setting up a National Paper Museum in Bengal.

 India is well known for its several museums. But, there is no dedicated museum for paper, said Vijay Kumar Karwa, president, Federation of Paper Traders Associations of India. There are such dedicated paper museums in more than 88 countries all over the world.

 Bengal has been a pioneer in papermaking, printing, publishing and packaging, said Karwa. As the seed of growth of the paper industry was sown here, it is imperative for the state government to preserve its heritage and history, he added.

 William Carey, the founder of modern paper making in the country had set up the first machine at the Titagarh Paper Mills. The site and the machine should be declared as national heritage and be converted into a centre of excellence for paper, Karwa said. The state finance minister, Asim Dasgupta, endorsed the proposal for setting up such a museum and preserving the site of Titagarh Paper Mills. 

 We are also keen on reviving both the Titagarh Paper Mills and the Bengal paper Mills, said Dasgupta.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Just bear with the bull

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept 8: Which way will the stock markets head from here?

 No one is ready to stick his neck out on this one just yet, though the large phalanx of investors ? both Indian and foreign ? seem to display varying shades of opinion.

 The rah-rah boys on the market who seem to have called all the market cues till now are betting that the sensex will scale up to 10,000 pretty soon ? but they will say this only sotto voce.

 Leading bulge bracket investors like Rakesh Jhunjhunwala have in recent times predicted a long term secular bull market for some time. The flow of money into Indian equities, Indian and foreign, is inevitable, Jhunjhunwala says in one of his PowerPoint presentations.

 But there have been a few naysayers as well, notably foreign brokerage CLSA, which said a couple of weeks ago that the Indian market appeared to be running out of steam and it was time for investors to pick up the cash that was on the table and scoot.

 No one doubts that a correction will happen: the big question is when and how it will affect the tide in the market.

 Some reckon that after the correction, there will be renewed vim in the market. 

 The foreign brokerages have tended to take a slightly more pessimistic view because of hardening interest rates in the US, rising global oil prices and a growing concern over the weakness of the dollar. 

 But beyond these overarching concerns, there are a few local ones as well: the pace of reforms in India, and the fear that the Bihar election results, if unfavourable to the ruling UPA coalition, could precipitate some political turmoil that could rub off on to the market.

 Jagdish Malkani, a prominent NSE broker, admits that deep down he isnt comfortable with the market valuations. 

 If the correction is good, the markets will benefit, he says. It will have a stronger bounce back.

 Arun Kejriwal of KRIS, a prominent portfolio manager, echoes his fear.

 Its a worry, Kejriwal says even as he points out that the 1000-point dash from 7000 to 8000 in 55 trading days has been virtually without any significant correction. 

 In a recent report, foreign brokerage Citigroup Smith Barney said it saw moderate overvaluation. It admits that Indian markets have a little downside. 

 As froth gets worked out from the market, and given the solid-looking economic outlook and what we see as only moderate overvaluation, we think there is reasonable downside protection in India.

 Stock prediction is always difficult; but then so is divination through palmistry or reading tea leaves.

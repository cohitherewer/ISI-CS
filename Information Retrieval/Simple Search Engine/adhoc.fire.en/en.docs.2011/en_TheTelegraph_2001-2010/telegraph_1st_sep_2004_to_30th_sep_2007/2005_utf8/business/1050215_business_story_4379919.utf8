 Automated REL meters to plug leaks

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 14: Reliance Energy (REL) will soon install automated meter reading for its customers in Mumbai, Delhi and Orissa in a move aimed at reducing human intervention in the process of tracking power consumption.

 According to a company release, remote meter reading systems for high-tension (industry) and low-tension (households) consumers will be put up in a phased manner in the two metros and Orissa.

 The machines based on GSM modem technology will minimise human intervention in the meter reading process, besides providing a host of value-added services.

 Apart from recording energy use on a real-time basis, the automated reading machines will store vital information on the quantum of power drawn, said REL, which says over 3,000 consumers are hooked to the new system.

 The state electricity boards in Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan and Karnataka recently floated tenders to select technology providers for their meter reading systems.

 Four projects worth Rs 608 crore, which the railways feels are immediately needed, have been categorised as number two. Another 30-35 national projects, defence funded proposals, public-private partnership ones and cost sharing plans have been placed in the third category. These are estimated at Rs 13,700 crore. All other railway projects have been categorised as number four.

 The government also cleared kharif season procurement prices for paddy, jawar, bajra, pulses and cotton. Prices of paddy and bajra were increased by Rs 10 a quintal, while cotton was increased by Rs 20 a quintal. 

 The minimum support price for paddy (common) has been hiked to Rs 570 per quintal from Rs 560 per quintal last year, while the paddy grade A price is now fixed at Rs 600 per quintal.

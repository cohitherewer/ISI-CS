 Vodafone warning signal 

 London, Nov. 15 (Reuters): Vodafone Group Plc warned that its struggling Japanese unit would crimp profit margin growth in 2007, casting a pall over strong half-year results and sending its shares tumbling more than 8 per cent.

 The worlds largest mobile phone company by revenue said on Tuesday earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation rose to ?6.7 billion on revenue of ?18.3 billion, a touch above consensus analyst forecasts.

 UK-based Vodafone also raised its share buyback programme by ?2 billion to ?6.5 billion for the year to next March, while increasing its dividend by 15 per cent to 2.2 pence. But Vodafone, which has shown cash discipline in the face of an acquisition spree across the sector, is armed with ?15 billion of balance sheet capacity and an investment grade credit rating ? and some had hoped for a 20 to 30 per cent pay-out increase.

 Further disappointment that the profit margin in Japan fell by 6 percentage points in the half-year, coupled with a warning of another significant reduction in the year to March 2007 and a cautious outlook for 2007, helped decline the shares.

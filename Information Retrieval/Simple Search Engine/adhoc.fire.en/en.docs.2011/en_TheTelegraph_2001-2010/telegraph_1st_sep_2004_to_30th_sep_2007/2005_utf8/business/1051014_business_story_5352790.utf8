 BP to join Bhatinda refinery

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Oct. 13: British Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation will form a 50:50 joint venture to tap the potential of refining and marketing sectors in India. The venture?s first project is a $3-billion refinery at Bhatinda in Punjab.

 The letter of intent was signed today by HPCL chairman M.B. Lal and John Manzoni, BP?s chief executive of refining and marketing, in the presence of Union petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar and BP group CEO Lord John Brown. 

 Aiyar said the partnership would offer HPCL opportunities to acquire or participate in refining and marketing assets that the BP group may identify from its overseas portfolio.

 The formal agreement for the joint venture will be signed within a month.

 The two companies will work out the financial model for the 9-million tonne Punjab refinery, likely to go on-stream in 2009. With BP?s financial muscle, the capacity of the refinery is likely to be increased.

 The partners will also develop a joint marketing strategy, which will include setting up of a network of retail service stations. Brown said BP would bring in world-class technology to India and HPCL would market the products of Bhatinda refinery under its brand. 

 BP will also help HPCL arrange crude supplies for the new refinery as well as the existing ones at Vizag and Mumbai, he added.

 BP has access to vast crude and gas reserves in its operations spread across 100 countries. 

 ?India is one of the fastest-growing energy markets in the world and we have been evaluating a range of potential areas where BP could get involved,? Brown said. 

 ?The strategic partnership with HPCL marks a major step forward for us and I?m delighted to be in India for the signing,? he added. 

 The joint venture will enable HPCL to enhance its refining capacity in north India, where it does not have a refinery. The region is dominated by Indian Oil.

 The HPCL chairman said the tie-up would add world-class service standards to the entire chain of petroleum business. 

 Aiyar said BP might participate with ONGC in exploration of oil blocks and a host of other business opportunities. This could include participation with the Indian Oil-Oil India combine as well.

 Brown, however, was cautious on the upstream sector. Although India has some hydrocarbon potential, as evident from gas discoveries off its east coast, the geological structures in the country have their limitations, he said. BP could look at some deep-sea blocks

 BP is already present in India with its Castrol brand of lubricants.

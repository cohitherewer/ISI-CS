 Mobile phone parts get duty relief

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 2: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today scrapped the 4 per cent countervailing duty on components used to manufacture mobile phones.

 He also extended the 7 per cent countervailing duty imposed on computer parts to laptops and notebooks as they had been inadvertently left out in the Union Budget for 2005-06.

 Industry was cool to the cosmetic changes in the duty structure for information technology and telecom sectors.

 A senior executive of MAIT, the apex body of computer hardware manufacturers, said, ?It is just a clarification that laptop and notebooks too will be covered under the same set of duties, which are applicable to computer and other parts. There is nothing exciting for the hardware industry.?

 Software companies were equally laconic. While software majors like Infosys and Satyam sought more time to react, Nasscom, the apex body of software and services companies, said a detailed analysis would be carried out soon to assess the impact.

 ?We had asked for a total exemption as these are legitimate business expenses. However, it is a step forward and we will be able to give a detailed analysis on Tuesday,? said Nasscom. 

 The telecom industry experts too were not enthused by the duty changes.

 Nokia, which will be one of the major beneficiaries of the decision to remove the CVD on mobile phone parts, did not comment as all its senior executives are away in Finland. 

 P. Balaji, president of Telecom Equipment Manufacturers Association of India (Tema), said, ?We would have liked the finance minister to extend similar exemption for domestic telecom equipment manufacturers. It would have certainly helped the sector.?

 A senior Tema executive said the cuts in duty for telecom components would have no impact for the next one year since there is no domestic manufacturing happening in India.

 India voices trade concerns

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Jakarta, April 23: India today sent clear signals to industrialised nations that their trade-distorting farm subsidies should be phased out and barriers to agricultural exports removed in a bid to protect livelihood security of millions of farmers in developing countries.

 Articulating developing countries? stand on this contentious WTO issue, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told leaders from over 100 Asian and African countries that ?We must strive to evolve a formulae to phase out trade-distorting subsidies in developed countries?.

 He also referred to the multilateral trade negotiations on industrial goods (non-agricultural market access) and said ?tariff and non-tariff barriers need to be lowered for our other exports?. 

 Voicing concerns over rigid visa restrictions that continue to obstruct free movement of people and services, he said it has deprived the people of Asia and Africa of full benefit from their main economic strength.

 ?We need greater protection for our bio-diversity resources and fair recompense for their exploitation by others, quot; he said. 

 The Prime Minister said international concern for protection of the environment was fully appreciated by countries of the two continents. quot;However, this goal needs to be balanced with the aspirations of the developing nations, quot; he noted.

 ?We need assured access to environment friendly technologies and the resources to induct them into our countries,? he said.

 Singh called for urgent measures to generate additional financial resources for development, especially for the least developed countries and the highly indebted poor countries.

 He also asked developing countries to gear up to meet the challenges of competition, both internal and external.

 ?We must adopt concerted measures both at the national and the international levels for an equitable management of increased global interdependence of nations,? he said.

 At the national level, the state must be modernised to create an environment conducive to growth and at the global level instrumentalities must be devised to deal with imbalances in the functioning of international political and economic order. 

 The Prime Minister pointed out that while globalisation had led to falling barriers to trade and rising living standards, the world continues to face a number of new threats and challenges. ?The threat of pandemics such as avian flu, the challenges posed by HIV-AIDS and terrorism, all require global solutions,? he said.

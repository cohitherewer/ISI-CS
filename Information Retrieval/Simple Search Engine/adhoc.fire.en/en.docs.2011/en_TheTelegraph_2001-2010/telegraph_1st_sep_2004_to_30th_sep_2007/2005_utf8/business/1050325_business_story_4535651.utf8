 Punjab Bank pulled up for old deal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 24: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has censured Punjab National Bank (PNB) for violation of conduct by the erstwhile PNB Capital Services Ltd (the merchant banker).

 This came after investigations showed that PNB Capital Services did not exercise due diligence and ensure proper care in discharging its duties as lead manager to a rights issue of Mefcom Capital Markets Ltd (MCML), a non-banking finance company.

 PNB Capital Services was merged with PNB after an order of Delhi High Court, following which the bank took overall assets and liabilities of the merchant banker. 

 According to Sebi, PNB is responsible for all the acts of commission and omission by PNB Capital Services.

 MCML, which deals with investments, hire purchases and leasing and merchant banking activities, came out with a rights-cum-public issue in February 1995. 

 The rights issue was for 50 lakh shares on a par in the ratio of 1:5, aggregating Rs 5 crore. 

 The public issue was for 21.20 lakh shares at a premium of Rs 60 apiece, aggregating to Rs 14.84 crore, along with detachable trade warrants in the ratio of 1:4.

 The market regulator, in an order dated February 18, said it received complaints regarding price rigging in the scrip of MCML prior to the rights-cum-public issue and initiated an investigation into the matter. 

 During the probe, it was found that PNB Capital Services, which was the lead manager to the issue, had failed to exercise due diligence and ensure proper care in discharging its duties. 

 ?It was found that PNB Capital Services did not exercise independent professional judgement and relied entirely on the statement of the issuer company regarding justification of premium,? Sebi said.

 The market regulator added that an officer was appointed to enquire into the alleged lack of diligence on the part of PNB Capital Services. 

 The officer issued a showcause notice to the company on August 2003 and received a reply from PNB on December 8, 2003. 

 Even as a personal hearing was granted by the enquiry officer, it was subsequently concluded that charges have been established. 

 He also observed that PNB Capital Services was no longer a merchant banker registered with Sebi and recommended a minor penalty of warning be issued.

 While a showcause notice was issued to PNB Capital Services on March 3, 2004, PNB (after the merchant banker merged with the bank) replied that the issue price was determined by the existing listed company in consultation with lead manager (PNB Capital Services). 

 Moreover, the lead manager had made a full disclosure in accordance with the guidelines to help investors take an informed decision.

 It also said the draft prospectus was vetted by Sebi and the justification for recommending a premium of Rs 60 was disclosed in the offer document in consultation with the market regulator. 

 Both qualitative and quantitative factors for justification of the premium was disclosed in the offer document.

 However, former Sebi chairman G. N. Bajpai, who passed the order, said in the prospectus relating to the issue that the lead manager to the issue in consultation with whom the premium was decided are of the opinion that the premium is reasonable and justified. 

 ?On perusal of the stock market data for the scrip for the years 1991-92 and 1992-93, I note that the highest traded price was Rs 4 and Rs 3 respectively. This was against the issue price of Rs 70 per share,? he added.

 Caution on EU offer for farm sops

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Nath: Thorns still there

 New Delhi, Oct. 30: Commerce minister Kamal Nath has said the latest offer made by the European Union in the ongoing Doha round of trade negotiations in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) was a mixed bag.

 He said the offer regarding agricultural market access was constructive and demonstrated the will to take the talks forward, but rejected outright the elements in the offer which sought to link the farm negotiations with non-agricultural market access (NAMA) and the services negotiations. 

 The European Union market access offer made on Friday proposed reducing EUs average agricultural tariffs by 46 per cent, with the highest tariff in the agriculture sector to be capped at 60 per cent.

 Nath rejected the NAMA proposal as it sought to introduce the concept of advanced developing countries and also preached a single co-efficient for tariff reduction for both developed and developing countries.

 In services, he said, the concept of quantitative benchmarks for opening up the services sector was unacceptable to India because it would not be possible for many developing countries to fulfil such obligations.

 The minister presented Indias view during a video-conference call here last night on the EU offer with EC trade commissioner Peter Mandelson, US trade representative Robert Portman, Brazils foreign minister Celso Amorim and Mark Vaile, minister of trade of Australia.

 Big two warn

 Meanwhile, IMF and World Bank chiefs have asked major trade blocs to set aside differences or else the opportunity may be lost at the next round of talks, adds PTI.

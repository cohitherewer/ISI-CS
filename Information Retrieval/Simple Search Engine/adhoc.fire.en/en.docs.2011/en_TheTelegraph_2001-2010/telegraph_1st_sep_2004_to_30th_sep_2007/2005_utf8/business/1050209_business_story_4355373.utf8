 Renault beats forecast

 Paris, Feb. 8 (Reuters): French carmaker Renault reported a sharp jump in yearly profits on Tuesday, which beat expectations, but predicted a narrowing in operating margins in 2005 due to tough market conditions. 

 The popularity of Renault?s quirky Megane range and strong demand outside western Europe helped it meet ambitious margin targets in 2004 as the industry battled with rising raw material costs and fierce price competition. 

 France?s second biggest auto maker said it made an operating profit of 2.418 billion euros ($3.11 billion) in 2004, up 72.5 per cent on 2003, giving it an operating margin of 5.9 per cent. 

 But it forecast a profit margin in 2005 of above 4 per cent of sales under IFRS accounting rules, which on that basis would compare with about 5.1 per cent in 2004. 

 ?In a sluggish market and an environment impacted by the rise in raw material prices, Renault intends to continue to grow its global sales and report a group operating margin ? under IFRS ? higher than 4 per cent of revenues,? the firm said in a statement. 

 Renault shares were up 0.47 per cent at 64.30 euros by 3:33 am EST when the European DJ Stoxx auto sector index was flat. 

 Outgoing chairman and chief executive Louis Schweitzer told reporters he was ?very pleased? with the strong results achieved in his last year in charge, describing 2004 as a ?great year? for the firm. 

 Renaults net profit, which includes a contribution from its 44 per cent stake in Japan?s Nissan, rose 43 per cent in 2004 to 3.551 billion euros, while sales climbed 8.4 per cent to 40.715 billion euros. 

 ?The results are satisfactory,? a Paris-based trader said. ?The sales figure is in line with estimates but the margin is above expectations and the guidance is good.? 

 The figures include 15 months of Nissan results, as the companies aligned their accounting periods. 

 In 2004 Nissan contributed 1.767 billion euros, and a further 432 million euros for the final quarter of 2003.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Birlas go to CLB with fresh plaint

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 6: The Birla family has moved the Company Law Board to stop what it claims is a fraudulent transfer of shares by Rajendra Singh Lodha in an MP Birla group firm.

 The petition filed by M. P. Birla?s sisters ? Laxmi Devi Newar and Radha Devi Mohatta ? at the board?s regional office here accuses Lodha of transferring 33,715 shares of East India Investment Company to himself on July 15 last year. The plea, filed last month, will come up for hearing on Wednesday.

 East India Investment Company has significant stakes in various group companies. 

 Alleging that Lodha wanted to ?usurp control? of the group, the sisters have prayed for cancellation of the transfer, which were in the name of Priyamvada Birla, and appointment of a special officer to take possession of the shares, register of members and other relevant records of the company. 

 Reacting to the move, a spokesperson for Fox amp; Mandal, the solicitor firm representing the chartered accountant, said: ?This is nothing but engaging in multiplicity of proceedings. We have mentioned the point in Calcutta High Court.? 

 The issue of appointment of an administrator to look after the assets of the MP Birla group came up for hearing in the high court today. 

 Arguing for Lodha and seeking the dismissal of the application filed by six members of the Birla family ? Krishna Kumar, Basant Kumar, Ganga Prasad and Yashovardhan and the two sisters of M. P. Birla ? senior counsel Shaktinath Mukherjee highlighted the way the country?s first business family was engaging in ?forum shopping?.

 Deficit in current account

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 30: The countrys current account showed a deficit of $6.2 billion during the first quarter of this year compared with a surplus of $159 million in the preceding period, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said today.

 There was a current account deficit because imports surpassed exports, mainly due to soaring crude oil prices. 

 Releasing the balance of payments (BoP) figures today, the central bank said merchandise trade deficit raced to $15.8 billion compared with $5.2 billion in the first quarter of last year.

 The merchandise exports growth at 22 per cent remained strong during the period, though the rate of export growth moderated, reflecting the high base in the previous year.

 Thin rise in Chevron profit

 Slippery world 

 New York, April 30 (Reuters): ChevronTexaco Corp. has reported a 5 per cent rise in quarterly profit driven by surging oil prices, but weak earnings at its refining operations dragged results below Wall Street forecasts. 

 The No. 2 US oil company?s refining and marketing profit fell 36 per cent, hit by work stoppages at its three major US refineries and weak marketing margins overseas. 

 Oil and gas production ? the bread and butter of the companys operations ? fell 7 per cent from a year earlier. 

 ?The earnings miss is annoying but not disastrous for ChevronTexaco,? Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Mark Flannery said in a research note. ?We assume that the weak operating result in US refining can be turned around quickly.?

 Net income in the first quarter rose to $2.68 billion, or $1.28 a share, from $2.56 billion, or $1.20 a share a year earlier. That was below analysts? average forecast of $1.38 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. 

 ChevronTexaco?s results come a day after Exxon Mobil Corp, the worlds largest publicly traded oil company, also posted profit that fell short of Wall Street estimates. 

 The shortfall in Exxon?s results were also largely tied to its refining and marketing operations, which suffered from weak marketing margins. 

 Shares of ChevronTexaco closed up 1.6 per cent, or 85 cents, at $52 on the New York Stock Exchange, amid a broader surge in energy stocks. 

 ChevronTexaco has been the worst performing Big Oil stock in recent months, lagging peers like Exxon, BP and ConocoPhillips due to a lukewarm reception to its proposed acquisition of Unocal and uncertainty over its ability to hit earnings targets.

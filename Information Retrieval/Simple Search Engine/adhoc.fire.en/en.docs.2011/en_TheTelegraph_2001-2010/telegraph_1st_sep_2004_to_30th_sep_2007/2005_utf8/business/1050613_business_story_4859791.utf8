 Q amp;A

 Old-age pangs

 I am 75 years old and physically challenged. I have no source of income other than bank interest and thus my income is not taxable. Since I do not have anyone to support me economically, I plan to sell my flat and live in an old age home. Shall I have to pay long-term capital gains tax on the amount received form the sale of my house?

 Samar Choudhury, Calcutta

 Long-term capital gain is subject to tax, since it 

 follows a different flat tax rate. However, you can 

 claim exemption by investing the amount in specified 

 capital gains bonds.

 Withdrawal symptoms

 I am an NRI working in the US for the past four years. While I was working in India, I purchased a life insurance policy from LIC for Rs 1,00,000 to save some money on taxes. I have been regularly paying my premium since then. Since I am eligible to withdraw 20 per cent of my savings from my policy after five years, I have decided to withdraw Rs 20,000 from my account. Do I need to pay taxes on this amount?

 S. K. Mitra, by e-mail

 Assuming that the policy you are referring to is a money back policy that allows one to withdraw specified sums at stipulated intervals, the money received by you shall not be taxable at the time of receipt.

 Stranded in the middle

 I sold my house in December 2004. So far I have not been able to get a suitable home and neither have I deposited the proceeds in a capital gain deposit scheme of a nationalised bank. By when should I do that? 

 Jayanti Ghosh, by e-mail

 If the new asset is not acquired till the date of filing return, one has to deposit the money in the specified scheme of a nationalised bank. Exemption is given on the basis of actual investment plus amount deposited.

 Tax tension

 Will the interest accrued at the end of the current financial year in a PPF account be taxable under the new tax rules?

 S. Chattopadhyay, Calcutta

 The interest on PPF account continues to be exempt from tax as the specific rules for taxing the amount have not yet been formulated.

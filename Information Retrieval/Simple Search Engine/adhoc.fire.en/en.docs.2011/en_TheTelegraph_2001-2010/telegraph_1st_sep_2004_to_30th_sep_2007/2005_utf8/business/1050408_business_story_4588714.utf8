 Calcutta, April 7: LG Electronics India Limited (LGEIL) has launched a range of dishwashers, dryers and washer dryers to develop its high-end lifestyle segment.

 The domestic market for all these products is in the nascent stage.

 ?The market for this category does not exist. We expect a CAGR of 62 per cent, with a target of 800 units this year and 9000 units by 2010 with a 50 per cent market share,? head-marketing Salil Kapoor said.

 The company expects the dryer and washer dryer segments to grow at a CAGR of 74 per cent and 97 per cent respectively.

 ?We have set a target of 500 units of dryer and 200 units of washer dryers this year,? added Kapoor. ?However, by 2010, we expect to take a 50 per cent market share in dryers and 85 per cent in washer dryers.?

 LG will focus on developing the lifestyle segment through these products and will start a door-to-door promotional campaign based on a database of users in the metros.

 The company will also focus on increasing the fully automatic washing machine market share.

 ?The company plans to increase its market share in the washing machine segment from 34 per cent last year to 40 per cent by December 2005 and 43 per cent next year,? said Kapoor.

 The segment is growing at a CAGR of 13 per cent.

 LG has already invested Rs 140 crore, of which Rs 95 crore will be in plant and machinery and Rs 45 crore on developing new models.

 The company plans to pump in Rs 55 crore more, with Rs 30 crore in plant and machinery and Rs 25 crore in product development.

 Currently, fully automatic washing machines are imported from the Korea facility. The company, however, plans to start production either in the Pune or Noida unit. The company has a manufacturing capacity of 700,000 units per annum. 

 Regarding the revenue target for the current year (January to December 2005), Kapoor said it expects to clock between Rs 8000crore and Rs 8500 crore.

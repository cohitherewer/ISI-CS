 NHPC charged up for new leap

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 31: National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC) has set a target of Rs 800 crore net profit in 2005-06.

 The power major today said it would explore the possibility of an initial public offering only after 2012. By that time, it plans to reduce dependence on the budgetary support from the government. 

 NHPC has 40 power projects at different stages of implementation that will require Rs 68,000-crore investment in the next seven years.

 The corporation has tied up a Rs 19,000-crore loan from Life Insurance Corporation of India.

 This apart, it will raise $100 million from ECS of France for 2,000-megawatt lower Subansiri project. For the Dhulasti 3x130-MW project, it will raise Rs 580 crore from domestic banks and financial institutions.

 NHPC has registered a nominal 10.17 per cent growth in net profit at Rs 684.58 crore in 2004-05 compared with Rs 621.38 crore posted in the previous fiscal. 

 Turnover stood at Rs 1,668.27 crore against Rs 1,414.43 crore in 2003-04.

 The power major has recommended a dividend of Rs 140 crore to the government for 2004-05. It has already paid Rs 60 crore during the year.

 Chairman and managing director A. K. Gangopadhyay said, New projects have improved NHPCs financial performance and this would be carried forward next year.

 Last fiscal, NHPC had earned Rs 1,634.74 crore by supplying power to various state electricity boards. NHPCs total realisation stood at Rs 1,645.58 crore. The realisation has improved over the last few years and only Rs 70 crore is left to be realised from SEBs, Gangopadhyay said.

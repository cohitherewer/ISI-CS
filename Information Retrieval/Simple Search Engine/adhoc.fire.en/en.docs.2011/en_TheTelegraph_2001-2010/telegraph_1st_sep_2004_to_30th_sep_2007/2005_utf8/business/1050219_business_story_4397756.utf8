 Pantaloon eyes Galaxy stake

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Feb. 18: Pantaloon Retail (India) Ltd will pick up a 15.73 per cent stake in Galaxy Entertainment Corporation at Rs 44 a share through a preferential issue, aggregating Rs 8.8 crore. Pantaloon will make an open offer to the shareholders of Galaxy.

 According to the deal, Pantaloon will subscribe to 20 lakh shares of Galaxy to acquire 15.73 per cent of the company through a preferential issue. As the breaching of the 15 per cent limit would trigger an open offer according to Sebi (Substantial Acquisition of Shares amp; Takeovers), Pantaloon said an open offer would soon follow.

 With the acquisition, Pantaloon will enter the leisure and entertainment business. A press statement said Pantaloon will strategically manage the business with an eye for exponential growth. Galaxy owns and operates Sports Bar, Bowling Company and Rain Restaurant in Mumbai.

 It is expected that with an increasing number of malls under development, the leisure and entertainment business is all set to witness bumper growth.

 Kishore Biyani of Pantaloon Retail said, ?Leisure and entertainment account for over 6 per cent of the aspirational consumer spend and is growing rapidly. With the increasing number of malls, there is a strong need for quality options of leisure and entertainment. Galaxy will fill that need for the aspirational customers.?

 Atul Ruia of Galaxy Entertainment said the growth in entertainment, food and beverages, and leisure business will be facilitated by the strong presence and availability of prime space that Pantaloon has in malls across the country.

 The Galaxy deal comes only days after Pantaloon inked a strategic joint venture agreement, wherein it will pick up 49 per cent of Planet Sports Pvt Ltd for over Rs 14 crore.

 Planet Sports is a leading sports and fashion retail company in the country and it is the sole franchisee of the UK-based retailer, Marks and Spencer. 

 It also has the exclusive distribution and licensing rights for well-known brands like Wilson, Puma, Speedo and Converse. It has six Marks and Spencer and 25 Planet Sports stores in the country.

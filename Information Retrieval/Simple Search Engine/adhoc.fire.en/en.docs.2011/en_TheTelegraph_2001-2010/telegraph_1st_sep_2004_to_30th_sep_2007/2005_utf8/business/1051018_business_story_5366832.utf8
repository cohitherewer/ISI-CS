 Port trust sights high tide in inland transport

 Calcutta, Oct 17: Calcutta port, having harboured large, sea-bound ships for years, is coasting along the Hooghly upstream trying to anchor an inland water transport (IWT) plan.

 A special package has been drawn up inviting the industry to ferry cargo along the river, where 18 jetties have been put in use. Tie-ups with private firms have been sewed up to develop cargo-transfer points on the banks.

 ?We are trying to promote inland waterways, the natural feature of a riverine port. We will set up more jetties and offer attractive packages to woo traders from the traditional modes of rail and road,? A. K. Chanda, chairman of Calcutta Port Trust (CPT), told The Telegraph.

 Inland water traffic typically accounts for 8-20 per cent of the port cargo internationally. In India, where there are rivers aplenty, that figure is a minuscule 0.15 per cent.

 The century-old Calcutta port is most favourably placed to tap the potential of inland transport since it sits at the confluence of two national waterways ? one from Allahabad to Haldia and the other from Haldia to Guwahati.

 Inland waterways are especially suitable for non-perishable low-value cargo. It is already popular, for instance, with those shipping fly ash from thermal power units.

 ?Historically, Calcutta port has moved from the north to south in to get deep draft of river and allow big ships to anchor. As a result, northern positions have been neglected. We must correct this historic blunder now,? Chanda added.

 To make amends, Chanda will need help. And, it could come from the Inland Waterways Authority of India, a central agency tasked with maintaining navigable draft, building terminals and creating night navigation facilities on rivers. It will have to join him on the voyage of discovery.

 More berths 

 Calcutta Port Trust will set up two more berths and four jetties in Haldia and Diamond Harbour at a estimated cost of Rs 275 crore. ?We will build two new berths at Haldia Dock Complex (HDC) at Rs 80 crore. Also four new jetties will come up, two each at Haldia and Diamond Harbour, within the next year,? Chanda said. He was speaking at the port trust?s anniversary lecture.

 Former state finance minister Ashok Mitra said unlike China, where inland water transport accounted for 35 per cent of inland trade, the sector has been neglected in India.

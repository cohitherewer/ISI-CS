 Mumbai, June 12: Air-India will restructure its operations by spinning off its engineering services division into a separate company ahead of its initial public offering.

 The division has around 3,000 employees, who will be transferred to the new company. 

 Confirming this, V. Thulasidas, A-I chairman and managing director, said, We have to restructure operations to meet the competition, otherwise well be overwhelmed and swept away. However, the new company will continue to be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Air-India.

 The engineering wing carries out maintenance, repairs and overhaul. The move to hive off this division will transform it into a strategic business unit, which will also offer its services to other domestic and foreign airlines. 

 Recently, the airlines doubled its fleet-size by taking aircraft on lease. 

 Other global airlines have also spun off their engineering divisions. Thulasidas said the spin-off would make the operations of the airline more efficient. It may also help the airline increase revenues from engineering operations. The unit is viewed as a service department.

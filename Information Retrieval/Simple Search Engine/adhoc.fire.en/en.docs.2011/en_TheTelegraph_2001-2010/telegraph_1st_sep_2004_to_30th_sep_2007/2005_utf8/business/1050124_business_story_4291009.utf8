 High goals in foreign trade

 New Delhi, Jan. 23 (PTI): The new foreign trade policy in March will unveil a strategy to achieve quantum jump in sectors with huge export potential.

 ?My attempt would be to push up exports in those sectors, which can grow manifold with a little push and certainly not those which are already doing well,? commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath said.

 ?If a sector is already exporting materials worth Rs 2,000 crore, it doesn?t need much help. I will look at those sectors, which can go up to Rs 20 crore from Rs 2 crore with a little push,? he said.

 He identified footwear components as one such sector, which could be given sops in the forthcoming trade policy.

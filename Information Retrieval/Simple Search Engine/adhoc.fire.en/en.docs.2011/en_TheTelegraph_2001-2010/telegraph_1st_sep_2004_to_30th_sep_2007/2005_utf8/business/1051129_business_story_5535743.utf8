 New Delhi, Nov. 28: The government will simplify investment procedures to attract more foreign direct investment (FDI).

 We are in the midst of a major overhaul of investment procedures. Proposals are under consideration of competent authorities and we would soon make announcements in this regard, department of industrial policy and promotion secretary Ajay Dua said at the India Economic Summit 2005. 

 Dua said though lack of adequate infrastructure such as roads and ports was an obstacle for foreign funds, it opened up new investment opportunities.

 He said the government was looking at redefining control on FDI flowing into the country. It might do away with the FIPB route for investments that are being vetted by Sebi, IRDA and other regulators. Dua said the government was only revisiting procedures and not tweaking FDI caps in different sectors.

 He admitted to problems in clearing projects but added that initiatives have been taken under the national e-governance action plan to resolve the problem.

 He compared the countrys policy framework with its neighbours ? China, Malaysia and Thailand ? but acknowledged the crippling effect due to a lack of physical infrastructure.

 You may ask if things are so hunky-dory, why doesnt money pour into the country? I would say, they are good but a major constraint is lack of physical infrastructure, Dua said.

 Its ports ? air and sea ? are bad and so is energy... But these constraints are also opportunities for investment, he added.

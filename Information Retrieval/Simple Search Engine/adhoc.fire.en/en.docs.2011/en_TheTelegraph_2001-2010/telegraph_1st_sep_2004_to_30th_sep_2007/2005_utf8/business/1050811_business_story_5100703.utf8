 RBI eagles on oil-price vigil

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Aug. 10: Expressing grave concern over the rising global crude oil prices, Reserve Bank governor Y. Venugopal Reddy today said the apex bank is keeping a close watch on the situation. 

 The rise in crude prices will directly affect forex reserves on the one hand and influence domestic prices on the other, the RBI governor said at an interactive meet with the students of Institute of Insurance and Risk Management here today. 

 If the price volatility is temporary, the burden should not be passed on to the people. But if it continues for long, there is no way but to pass it on ? someone will have to bear it. It is a tricky situation which needs careful monitoring and response, he added. 

 Talking of other issues, Reddy said the central bank is promoting a payment corporation system to speed up clearance transactions of banks across the country. He said the RBI board cleared the plan at its meeting on Tuesday yesterday. It is now for the Indian Banks Association to carry it forward, he said.

 The RBI governor also said the apex bank has introduced the practice of daily assessment of the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) for banks to circumvent the cash thrust in the lending market. If need be, we can even do an assessment even twice or thrice a day, quot; he said. 

 Commenting on the issue of capital convertibility, Reddy said, There is virtually full convertibility available for all. Indian companies are enjoying the flexibility and there is only a few restrictions on financial intermediaries and individuals.

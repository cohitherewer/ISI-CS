 Visaka plans Rs 200cr update

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 17: Visaka Industries has finalised a Rs 200-crore investment plan for the next three years. The company would spend about Rs 175 crore to expand its textiles business in the post-quota regime. 

 It is also planning a second green-field asbestos cement sheet unit, which would be either located in Bengal or Jharkhand.

 Visaka, promoted by Hyderabad-based physician-turned-entrepreneur Dr G. Vivekanand, is the second largest group in fibre cement roofing sheet industry with plants in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Bengal.

 By the end of this fiscal the company is targeting to raise its capacity to 4.5 lakh tonne from 3.8 lakh tonne by adding a plant at Rae Bareilli in UP.

 Visakas asbestos unit at Jhargram, started in March 2003, had achieved a world record of highest monthly output at 8,500 tonne on a single machine in May.

 Before this, a plant in Brazil had achieved the highest monthly production at 8,300 tonnes.

 Encouraged by the performance, the group has decided to double the capacity of the factory from 80,000 tonne to 1.6 lakh tonne per annum, Vivekanand said. The company is also planning to put up a second unit in the region, he added.

 Apart from this, Visaka manufactures synthetic blended yarn with twin-air jet spinning technology at its Nagpur plant. 

 The company has also acquired land at Mahindra special economic zone near Chennai for a garment manufacturing unit, which will be set up this year. Visaka is already negotiating with a few international garment brands for outsourcing their manufacturing orders, Vivekanand said.

 The group is also planning to set up a weaving unit with a capacity of 5-million metre fabric near Mumbai.

 Vivekanand said the company was talking to the government for securing about Rs 100 crore from the Textile Development Fund. The rest of the money will be generated from internal accruals.

 Honda Civic to get new engines

 Tokyo, July 5 (Reuters): Honda Motor unveiled improved gasoline and hybrid engine systems of its best-seller sedan Civic on Tuesday that would boost mileage and performance on the cars remodelled versions due later this year. 

 With global sales of nearly 600,000 units a year, the Civic is Hondas best-selling model after the Accord, and the refreshed version is widely expected to generate big sales gains for Japans third-biggest auto maker. 

 Honda said the improved i-VTEC (intelligent Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control System) technology ? a mechanism that helps engines burn fuel more efficiently while enhancing driving performance ? would raise the engines fuel economy by 6 per cent in the new gasoline-only Civic.

 The new 1.8-litre engine is 5 kg lighter than the 1.7-litre engine that currently powers the Civic, thanks largely to the use of fewer components ? something Honda has promised to pursue to lower costs. 

 Honda has also developed a more powerful, fuel-efficient hybrid system that would enable its gasoline-electric vehicles to run solely on the electric motor at low cruising speeds for the first time, like Toyota Motors popular Prius sedan. 

 The new system features an evolved, three-stage 1.34-litre i-VTEC engine, combined with Hondas IMA (integrated motor assist) technology to achieve a 20 per cent jump in output compared with the performance of a conventional 1.8-litre engine. 

 The system is smaller, lighter and costs 30 per cent less than the existing version, a Honda engineer said. 

 Honda has long been at the forefront of green powertrain technology, most famously with the development of the CVCC (Compound Vortex Controlled Combustion) engine in 1973. The company also became the worlds first to meet the US Clean Air Act requirements without a catalytic converter, which gave the Civic its name.

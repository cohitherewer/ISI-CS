 Cablecom laps up Liberty Global offer, junks IPO

 The big dream

 Zurich, Sept. 30 (Reuters): Liberty Global said it had agreed to buy Switzerlands Cablecom for 2.825 billion Swiss francs ($2.187 billion), halting the countrys biggest flotation in four years and taking investors by surprise.

 Cablecom, the biggest competitor to former state monopoly Swisscom, said on Friday it was abandoning its IPO announced just a day earlier, which would have valued the firm at up to 3.5 billion francs.

 The shareholders of Cablecom are provided with an attractive opportunity to exit their investment following a highly successful financial restructuring, which has allowed Cablecom to take advantage of the growth opportunities in its market, Cablecom said.

 Liberty Global is the largest owner of cable assets outside the US and was formed when Liberty Media International acquired European cable firm, UnitedGlobalCom, in June. 

 Liberty said the deal, in which it will acquire 100 per cent of Cablecoms equity, would make it the largest broadband cable operator in 11 of its 14 European markets. The takeover would be financed largely by debt, it said.

 Continued expansion of our footprint in Europe is a core strategic objective, said Mike Fries, president and CEO of Liberty Global.

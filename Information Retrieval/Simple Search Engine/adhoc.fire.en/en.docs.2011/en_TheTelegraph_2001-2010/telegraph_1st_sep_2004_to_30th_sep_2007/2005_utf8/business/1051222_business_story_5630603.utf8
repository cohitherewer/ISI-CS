 Calcutta, Dec. 21: Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has invited proposals for investment from Singapore in labour-intensive commodities and sectors in the state. 

 Bhattacharjee said this in a meeting today with the chairman of the Singapore Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SICCI) organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).

 We have confirmed that we will participate in the partnership summit to be held in January and will submit our detailed investment proposals for various sectors in India, said SICCI chairman, M. Rajaram.

 The chief minister has asked for balanced investment proposals in the fields of agro processing, leather and other such labour-intensive sectors to create high job generation and protecting the labourers. We have promised to come up with such proposals, he added.

 The Singapore Indian Chamber of Commerce has submitted a proposal to set up a college to teach Japanese under a Japan-India-Singapore collaboration, Rajaram mentioned. Since Japanese is the official language for them, the investors from the country insist on a person conversant with the language for negotiations and discussions regarding any investment, he explained. The Bengal chief minister has accepted the proposal and has promised to get back soon with necessary approvals, Rajaram added.

 Rajaram further mentioned that all the investments from Singapore till date were channelled into the states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and other states. Though Bengal is a late starter, the state has made a comeback in industrial growth in the last 18 months and major investments are in the pipeline, he said.

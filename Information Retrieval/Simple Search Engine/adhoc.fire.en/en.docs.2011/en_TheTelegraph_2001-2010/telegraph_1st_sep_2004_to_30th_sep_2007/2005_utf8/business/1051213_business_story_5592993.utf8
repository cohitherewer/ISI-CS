 New Delhi, Dec. 12: The Left and other opponents of trade liberalisation have warned the government against striking compromises at the meeting of ministers of World Trade Organisation member countries this week in Hong Kong.

 The CPM has told the government that under no circumstances is the economy to be opened up further, especially in agriculture and the services. There is going to be huge pressure exerted by the developed countries, and we expect the government to stand up to it, said CPM politburo member and Rajya Sabha MP Brinda Karat.

 With the five-year Doha round of global trade talks approaching its end, developed countries are expected to increase the pressure on India and other like-minded members of the Group of 20 countries to accept some of their demands in Hong Kong. 

 WTO head Pascal Lamy has said: The failure of the Doha round will be seen as a failure of the WTO.

 Speaking from Hong Kong, Vandana Shiva, environmentalist and WTO opponent, said: Developed countries will try their best to break the stand taken by the G-20 countries.

 The G-20 has been asking the developed world to reduce agricultural subsidies, which, they feel, give farmers of these countries an undue advantage over their counterparts in the developing nations.

 The European Union and the US, on the contrary, want developing nations to remove entry tariffs, which countries like India use to protect indigenous industry. 

 Shiva, in Hong Kong to participate in the discussions being held by WTO protesters alongside the ministerial meet, said developing nations should be prepared to face a carrot-and-stick policy.

 Carrot in the sense that the draft text for the talks mentions aid for trade, which means developing countries are going to be given financial support to fulfil WTO obligations. 

 Stick means developing countries will be told that if they dont agree to the removal of market entry barriers, there will be no reduction in agricultural subsidies by the developed world, she said.

 Karat said the Left would oppose any acceptance by the government of the aid for trade clause. The US and EU have not fulfiled their WTO obligations. They have not cut agricultural subsidies, so what aid are they talking about?

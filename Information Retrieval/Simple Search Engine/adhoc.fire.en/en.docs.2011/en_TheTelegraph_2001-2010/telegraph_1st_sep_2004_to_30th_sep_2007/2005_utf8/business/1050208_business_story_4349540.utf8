 Calcutta, Feb. 7: The Finance Industry Development Council (FIDC) has submitted a pre-budget memorandum to the Union finance ministry urging a level-playing ground for non-banking finance companies with banks and infrastructure capital companies.

 ?We have identified five major issues and have submitted the representation during the second week of January,? said Sanjay Chamria, managing committee member of FIDC.

 The representation says NBFCs? income is subject to income tax before deductions on provisions made for bad assets.

 However, for banks, provisions for non-performing assets are deducted before calculating taxable income.

 Chamria said such provisions are made in an NBFC?s books to represent the healthy financial status of these financial companies. Thus, the council expects an amendment to the relevant portions of section 36(1)(viia) and 43D.

 Secondly, NBFCs are not entitled to certain benefits available to infrastructure capital companies and funds by way of tax exemptions.

 The representation suggests that such exemptions should also be made available to the NBFCs to the extent of their investment in infrastructure projects listed under section 80-IA. Also, the benefits of the provisions of section 36(1)(viii) for long-term investments in the specified infrastructure projects through lease, hire purchase or loan transactions should be made available to NBFCs.

 ?Further, the tax deducted at source for interest payments made to NBFCs on the loans advanced by them accounts for as much as 3 per cent of our income. In such a competitive market, our profit margins get affected by such a high TDS rate and are often left with a negative fund flow position,? explained Chamria.

 The council, in its representation, has also asked for creating a separate fund for making refinance available to NBFCs at a cheaper rate.

 ?In its credit policy, the RBI has suggested phasing out of public deposits by NBFCs. We have asked the apex bank to arrange for an alternate source of raising finance and then phase out deposits,? said Ravi Todi, managing committee member of FIDC.

 The representation also wants the SARFAESI Act to be applicable for NBFCs.

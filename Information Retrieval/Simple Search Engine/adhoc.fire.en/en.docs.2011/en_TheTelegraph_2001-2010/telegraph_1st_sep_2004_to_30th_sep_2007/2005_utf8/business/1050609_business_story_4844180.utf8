 New service for ad mails

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 8: The Union communications ministry today approved the introduction of Direct Post, a new mailer service to distribute advertising mailers. 

 Through this mail service, advertising materials would be directly distributed to prospective customers, officials said. The department of posts (DoP) expects a higher business volume and revenue from this service, they added.

 Direct Post would enable business houses send mailers, pamphlets, brochures and other advertising materials like CDs/floppies, cassettes, samples to prospective customers at Rs 1.50 per mail within a city or a district and at Rs 2 throughout the country.

 The approval for the new service has been received from communications minister Dayanidhi Maran, who is in the US, said an official statement.

 The DoP is also planning to launch products that would facilitate the growth of commerce in the country, officials said.

 Direct mail service has shown a remarkable growth in developed countries. 

 The DoP is ambitious about the scope of this service. It is pinning hopes on an over 6 per cent GDP growth rate and more than 9 per cent growth of the services sector. 

 To make use of this business opportunity for the benefit of the department of posts, as also to make the extensive network of post offices available for the growing direct mail advertising industry of India, the minister has now ordered the introduction of Direct Post, with immediate effect. Necessary enabling orders and guidelines have already been issued, stated a release issued by the communications ministry.

 Business houses would have to tender a minimum of 1,000 articles. A discount of 5 per cent would be available for mailings of over 50,000 articles. Advertising agencies will be entitled to a 5 per cent commission on mailings of over 50,000 articles.

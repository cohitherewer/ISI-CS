 Duty-cut dose in policy

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 29: The government has proposed a slew of measures to make medicines more accessible at affordable rates. These include reducing the excise duty to 8 per cent, free medicines to poor families and a Rs 100-crore subsidy for manufacturing cancer drugs.

 The draft National Pharmaceutical Policy 2006 has advocated the reduction of excise duty on all pharmaceutical products from 16 per cent to 8 per cent. It also wants the exemption limit of small-scale units from excise duty to be raised from the present turnover level of Rs 1 crore to Rs 5 crore.

 The department of chemicals, the nodal authority that prepared the draft, is expected to present the final policy for cabinet approval in a few weeks.

 These measures are likely to reduce prices of medicines and also provide relief to small-scale units leading to their survival, improved quality and better tax compliance, which would have a positive effect on the revenues of the government, it said.

 From January 2005, excise duty is levied on 60 per cent of the maximum retail price (MRP) of medicines compared with the ex-factory rate earlier. This has increased the burden on the industry, particularly the small-scale sector.

 The government has also proposed that the MRP of packaged drugs should be calculated inclusive of all taxes. Under the provisions of the Package Commodities Rules, 1977, all commodities sold in the packaged form are required to have a label declaration of the retail sale price in the form of MRP that is inclusive of all taxes. At present, the concept is being used for all packaged goods except drugs.

 The government feels that the MRP plus local taxes formula for retail prices leads to wrong calculations, extra charges and debate between the dealer and the consumer.

 From the consumers point of view, it is desirable that the total price should be absolutely clear on the pack and uniform all over India, it said.

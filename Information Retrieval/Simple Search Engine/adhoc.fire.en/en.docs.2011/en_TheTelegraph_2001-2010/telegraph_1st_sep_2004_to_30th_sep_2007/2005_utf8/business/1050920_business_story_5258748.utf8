 Calcutta, Sept. 19: Beeyu Overseas Limited is keen to acquire a tea factory in Bengal and has shortlisted a few units.

 The company is currently negotiating the terms as well as the price and is confident of clinching the deal by December.

 The company has also bid for a joint venture with a public quoted company in Sri Lanka having four tea factories and 2000 hectares of plantation.

 If the bid is accepted, Beeyus presence will extend to the Sri Lankan market for production of high quality tea, chairman B.P. Singh said on the sidelines of the annual general meeting of the company.

 Beeyu has tea gardens in Tamil Nadu. The company had applied for listing on the National Stock Exchange (NSE). Beeyus shares are listed on the Calcutta Stock Exchange and Bombay Stock Exchange.

 Singh also said after the recent public issue, which was oversubscribed 12.6 times, the companys shares have been listed on the BSE.

 The number of shareholders of the company has also increased to 12,644. The company shares, which were issued at Rs 14 apiece, are currently trading on the BSE between Rs 25 and Rs 27.80.

 The company is now on a fast-track mode and its new factory in Ooty ? for which the public issue was made ? has already been commissioned on September 7 and the trial run is on, Singh said.

 The company has experience in the coffee market for a long time and has been exporting coffee to the Russian market for the last eight years.

 The company has decided to go for a marketing joint venture with Tata Coffee, Singh said.

 Recently, Beeyu Overseas was in the news as there were conjectures that it could face a hostile takeover bid from Calcutta-based investor S.K. Khetan, who was mulling the option of making an open offer for a 33 per cent stake. He already holds 3 per cent of the stock.

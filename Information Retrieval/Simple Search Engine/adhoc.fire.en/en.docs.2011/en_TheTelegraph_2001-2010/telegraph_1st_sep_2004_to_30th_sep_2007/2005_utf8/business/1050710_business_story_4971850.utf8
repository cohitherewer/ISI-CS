 Energiser for Dabhol revival

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 9: The financial settlement between Indian lenders of Dabhol Power Company and foreign partner Bechtel is in sight, paving the way for the revival the 2,184-mw project. 

 Dabhol, a power project floated by US firm Enron, is shut for over four years. The group of ministers (GoM) is confident that the final solution discussed today will help restart the gas-based plant in Maharashtra soon.

 Power secretary R. V. Shahi said, The representatives of Indian financial institutions today informed the GoM that they will ink the settlement with Bechtel in a few days. It is a good sign for the sector.

 Refusing to divulge details, Shahi said, Normal administrative procedures will have to be followed before the details could be made public.

 Bechtel and GE own 85 per cent in the Dabhol Power Company.

 IDBI, State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, IFCI and Canara Bank have already reached an agreement with GE to pay $145 million in three instalments.

 A power ministry official said, The cabinet note will contain all the details of the settlement, including the payment to be made to the major foreign partners and overseas lenders. We hope that the cabinet note would come up for approval before the month-end.

 Ministry sources also said, The foreign partners have already agreed in principle that they will drop cases against the Indian government if a settlement is reached. We expect them to give a written statement soon. GE and Bechtel had filed a claim of more than $6 billion against the government at a London arbitration panel for breach of investment protection pacts.

 Sources said in todays meeting, the GoM considered the status report of negotiations with various stakeholders. The two investment bankers, NM Rothschild and SBI Caps, who were earlier asked by the GoM to prepare a detailed report on reviving the Dabhol plant, apprised the ministers about the negotiations.

 The Indian lenders have already reached an agreement with overseas financial institutions to buy out their debt for $230 million and with the Overseas Investment Promotion Corporation for $111 million.

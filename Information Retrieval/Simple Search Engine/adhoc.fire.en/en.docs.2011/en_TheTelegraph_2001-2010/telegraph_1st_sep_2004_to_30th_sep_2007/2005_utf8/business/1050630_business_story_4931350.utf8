 Orchid blooms in US drug market

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 29: Chennai-based Orchid Chemicals amp; Pharmaceuticals will foray into the oral formulations business in the US. The company has obtained the USFDAs approval for its abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) of cephalexin capsules.

 This is the first ANDA approval received by the company in the formulations segment in the US. The ANDA is an application made to secure approval for manufacture and sell of the generic version of a drug. 

 Orchid officials said the patent on cephalexin (an antibiotic) has expired more than a decade ago and there are 15-16 players in this business in the US. Though the product is not seen as a big molecule, officials added that it makes sense to offer the drug as it is a part of its product market.

 The molecule will be distributed in the US by Par Pharmaceuticals Inc. Orchid has a tie-up with Par for the distribution of oral antibiotics. 

 It has a similar alliance with Apotex for sterile products. Orchid also has tie-ups with Alpharma Inc, Stada and Par for non-antibiotic products. 

 Sources said Orchids distribution pact with Par include eight molecules, which will be launched after receiving the respective approvals. Orchid has so far filed for more than 18 ANDAs.

 Cephalexin is expected to be launched in the US soon.

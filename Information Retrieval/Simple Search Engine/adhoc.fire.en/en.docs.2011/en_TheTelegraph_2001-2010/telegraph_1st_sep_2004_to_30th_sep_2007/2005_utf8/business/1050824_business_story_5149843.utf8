 Meet to clear Tetley merger

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 23: Tata Tea Ltd has called a court-convened shareholders meeting to consider and approve its decision to merge Tata Tetley, the wholly owned subsidiary, with itself. The meeting will be held in Calcutta on September 19.

 Incorporated in 1992, the 50:50 joint venture between Tata Tea and Tetley was primarily in the business of tea bagging and packaging. Its businesses were mainly in West Asia and Poland. After Tata Tea acquired Tetley of UK, the company moved its Australian operations to Tata Tetley and ramped up capacity of the plant. 

 However, the entire manufacturing operations of Tetleys plant in Yara in Australia was shut down and transferred to the Kochi-based 100 per cent export oriented unit of Tata Tetley. The joint venture also has a plant in Indore in Madhya Pradesh.

 Tata Tea officials had said several times on previous occasions that it didnt make commercial sense to keep Tata Tetley as a separate entity post-acquisition of the Tetley group.

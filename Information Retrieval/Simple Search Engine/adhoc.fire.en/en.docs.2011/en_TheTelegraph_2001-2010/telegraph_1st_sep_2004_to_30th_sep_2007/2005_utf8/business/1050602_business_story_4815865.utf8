 Reliance Info hastens broadband plan

 Wired up

 Calcutta, June 1: Reliance Infocomm plans to roll out its enterprise broadband services in 200 cities by the end of the year.

 Broadband service for enterprises consists of an integrated voice, data and video solution. The convergent voice-data-video framework is delivered through the fibre-to-the- building architecture

 Prakash Bajpai, president, wireline business, Reliance Infocomm, said, We are already offering this service in 150 pockets across 30 cities in the country and are in the process of wiring up 180,000 buildings. We have already acquired over 60,000 customers across 410 companies.

 The company has shortlisted 1,200 key corporate accounts and is targeting to register 800-900 of them as its customers. It has already invested Rs 1,500 crore in creating the broadband network and has earmarked another Rs 800-900 crore to be spent over the next few months.

 Broadband penetration in the country is a mere 0.02 per cent, explains Bajpai. With the addressable market size estimated at one million subscribers, the market is grossly under-served at present. The opportunity to build robust solutions is huge and we have set a target of 0.5 million subscribers within a year.

 Reliance will provide customised solutions for enterprises to deliver voice or complex data solutions, including nation-wide networking of all branches, sales and field executives, vendors, suppliers and customers at a data transfer speed of 64 kilobytes per second to 100 megabytes per second. 

 We are eyeing 35-40 per cent of the IT expenditure of companies coming our way. The broadband service will not only offer speedier connections to the Internet, but also help firms network their branches through Centrex like architecture. This will result in a 25-30 per cent savings for firms, said Bajpai. He added that Reliance would first create the infrastructure to deliver broadband applications. 

 According to Bajpai, while big companies will adopt the larger integrated solutions, the real growth will come from the SMEs, which will contribute to volume growth.

 We have already got 40 per cent share of the wired building network. The aim is to cover 17 lakh buildings within the next two to three years, with a target of acquiring 10 million customers, said Bajpai.

 On the retail broadband or Home Netway front, Reliance Infocomm is in the process of conducting pilot projects in Mumbai, Jamnagar and Delhi. In Bengal, the company has an arrangement with the nodal agency Webel to provide the last mile connectivity through cable operators.

 With no benchmark to guideline available on the retail broadband front, we prefer to extend the pilot projects to more cities. Within the next 8-10 months we expect to be able to cover 20 million households, he added.

 Wait lengthens for RIL shareholders

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Dec. 2: The shareholders of Reliance Industries will have to wait till December 5 to know about the future of the proposed demerger scheme of the company.

 Bombay High Court today adjourned till Monday a petition filed by RIL seeking its approval for the proposed demerger scheme as one of the shareholders sought time to advance arguments on opposing the move.

 RIL, which proposed a demerger scheme as settlement between the Ambani brothers, Mukesh and Anil, has urged the court to dismiss the intervening application of the shareholder, opposing the scheme, saying he was holding to ransom the entire process of demerger of RIL, which has around 20 lakh shareholders.

 RIL, the countrys largest private enterprise, also argued that the objections raised by the intervening shareholder were speculative in nature.

 Kalpesh Bharatkumar Mankad, the shareholder concerned, however, argued that RIL had indulged in unfair practice and saw the demerger scheme more of a kind of family arrangement than a business separation.

 Hearing the matter, Justice Nishita Mhatre adjourned the petition after the intervenor sought more time to argue.

 The company also informed the court that Rajkot-based Ghanshyam Mehta, who claims to be an unsecured creditor of Reliance Telecom, a subsidiary of RIL, has moved a Rajkot court expressing concern over his investment in the company after the introduction of the proposed demerger scheme.

 Mankad had filed an affidavit saying that the committee formed under the chairmanship of retired high court judge M.L. Pendse has not disclosed to the court the memorandum of objections filed by him during the extraordinary general meeting of the company held on October 21.

 Promoters hold 46.76 per cent in RIL, foreign investors hold around 30.93 per cent, banks and mutual funds 8.03 per cent and 14.27 per cent are lying with small and marginal shareholders, he said and submitted that the petitioner company ought to have bifurcated the shareholders in terms of the aforesaid shareholding in the petitioner company.

 In the absence of such an arrangement, serious injustice has been done to minority and individual shareholders, Mankad alleged.

 The price of partially oriented yarn has been reduced by 9.1 per cent to Rs 64.07 per kg from Rs 70.51, industry sources said.

 It also reduced the price of polyester stable fibre by 3.3 per cent to Rs 67.55 per kg from Rs 65.30.

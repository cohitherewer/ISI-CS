 New Delhi, July 12: Air Sahara today said it has entered into a code-sharing agreement with American Airlines. They will also market services from a common platform. 

 Air Sahara will code-share the new service and jointly market it alongside American Airlines, said Rono Dutta, the airlines president.

 Meanwhile, the US carrier has announced its daily non-stop Delhi-Chicago flight, which will start from November 15. It will be operated by Boeing 777-200 aircraft, said American Airlines vice-president Craig Kreeger.

 Dutta denied reports that Air Sahara was up for sale or that an offer had been made to sell the airline to Kingfisher Airlines. Its all bunkum ... we are supported by the Sahara group and we will remain a part of that group.

 Recently, there have been media reports that Kingfisher is attempting to buy out Air Sahara. Dutta dismissed this as rubbish, and said the airline is currently concentrating on leveraging its domestic network and targeting global destinations by tying up with American Airlines and British Airways. 

 Air Sahara would soon hold discussions with Cathay Pacific for the Southeast Asian market, he added.

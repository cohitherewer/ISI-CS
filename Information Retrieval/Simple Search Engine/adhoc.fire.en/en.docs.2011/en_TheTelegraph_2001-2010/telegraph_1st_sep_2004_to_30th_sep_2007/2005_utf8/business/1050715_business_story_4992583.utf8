 Group insurance rules tightened

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, July 14: The insurance regulator has tightened norms for group insurance schemes and corporate agents to prevent unfair practices by insurers and intermediaries to bag more business.

 In separate guidelines, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) spelt out the dos and donts for group insurance and corporate agents. The new norms rationalise the approach that an insurer needs to adopt for group insurance policies.

 A group should consist of persons who assemble together with a common purpose or perform a common economic activity like employees of a company.

 However, other groups like a welfare society, credit card holders, borrowers of a bank and professional associations may be treated as a group provided the organiser has an authority from majority of the members to arrange the insurance cover.

 No group should be formed with the main purpose of availing of insurance... A person negotiating group insurance rates and then going around finding members to insure will not be considered as a legitimate group, it said.

 IRDA also barred insurers from offering insurance cover to a member who leaves the group. Entry into the group insurance scheme for an individual will be on a well-defined date.

 Insurers have been asked to sell group insurance schemes either directly or through an agent and not through someone who does not have a licence.

 The insurer has been asked to specify the premium charged and benefits available to each member of the group.

 The group manager will not have the liberty to vary the premium rates or benefits for individuals unless it is predetermined.

 In case of discounts offered by insurers on group schemes, IRDA said: Such discounts should be based on valid underwriting considerations such as group size and shall be passed on to the members.

 The discounts may be shared by those who paid the premium in proportion to the amount paid by them, it added. IRDA also barred agents or managers to pass on any management expenses to the employees.

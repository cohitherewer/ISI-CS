 Calcutta, Sept. 8: Merchant bankers to draw up the roadmap for divestment of member-brokers stake of 51 per cent in the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) will be appointed in two months.

 We have invited presentations from 10 merchant bankers and will finalise the list in two months, said Rajnikant Patel, BSEs managing director and chief executive officer.

 The announcement follows the end of corporatisation in late August that saw the 130-year-old exchange turn into a company. Member-brokers who now own all of the exchange will have to bring down their stake to 49 per cent within a year of the corporatisation.

 We are exploring all possibilities, including an initial public offer, private placement and strategic stake sale while looking at the divestment process, he said.

 Patel said being a zero-debt organisation meant the BSE did not require fresh funds. So, what was needed is a business plan to utilise funds raised from the stake divestment. The merchant bankers will also finalise the business roadmap of the exchange, the BSE top gun said.

 As a corporatised entity, the BSE has an initial capital of Rs 75 lakh with 10,000 shares of Re 1 each allotted to every member. A new 12-member governing board with brokers presence of 25 per cent, is already in place.

 Patel said the exchange was looking for new avenues in the area of financial services. We might create subsidiaries for some of our services and venture into new areas based on their revenue potential, explained Patel.

 The old surveillance system on BSE will be replaced with a new integrated online analytic module that uses business intelligence and works seamlessly across the equity and the futures and options segment, Patel said. Our technology partner is Wipro, which will install the system in a month. It is now in the testing stage, he added.

 BSE is also in the process of decentralising its functions in a way that will convert its Delhi office into a full-fledged regional centre, followed by Calcutta, Patel said.

 We have added 200 deposit-based members in the last year, most of them outside Mumbai and Maharashtra. At present, we have 780 members while the remaining are in the process of getting registered. Another 100 will be added this year, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Asim tax sweetener for the cup of cheer

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Dasgupta: Good news

 Calcutta, Feb. 8: Asim Dasgupta today stirred a much-needed sweetener in tea when he announced a value-added tax (VAT) of only 4 per cent on the beverage.

 The Bengal finance minister, who also heads the inter-state panel which cleared the way for the new levy, told the national executive meeting of Ficci that the cut from 12.5 per cent should bring cheer to the industry. 

 This, indeed, happened. Within minutes of his declaration, C. K. Dhanuka, chairman of the Indian Tea Association (ITA), expressed happiness at the new tax rate. ?We were worried about a price rise from April if a 12.5 per cent VAT was imposed. This would have hit tea consumption. But today?s clarification means firms in all states will pay only a VAT of 4 per cent, nothing else.?

 Tea consumption in India is even lower than that of Pakistan. India?s per capita consumption is 660 gram per annum. At 12.5 per cent VAT, the selling price of tea would have gone up 25 per cent.

 The proposed 12.5 per cent VAT on tea would have raised the prices at the retail stage by 8-10 per cent per kg (Rs 10 to Rs 20 per kg). 

 ?The consumers would have been the worst sufferers. It is a great relief to them,? Dhanuka added.

 Tea industry officials said most of the states were keen on a 12.5 per cent VAT on loose/packed tea sold to consumers. But the tea industry has been lobbying for a lower VAT on the ?common man?s drink?. India produces more than 800 million kilograms of tea in a year. 

 Twenty six of the 28 state finance ministers are keen that VAT on tea be put at 12.5 per cent. Only two states had suggested lower rates. 

 Citing the inflationary impact of increased incidence of tax on tea, the Federation of All India Tea Traders? Association had also made a representation to Dasgupta requesting him to reduce the VAT from 12.5 per cent to 4 per cent.

 Bengal bets on PSE rejig

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Room For More

 Calcutta, Sept. 11: The second phase of restructuring of loss-making public sector enterprises (PSE) may help the Bengal government save Rs 500 crore.

 The budgetary outflow to 36 PSEs, which it plans to restructure in the second phase, is Rs 1,400 crore annually.

 If the programme is successfully implemented, the government support may reduce to Rs 900 crore.

 Ardhendu Sen, principal secretary, public enterprise department, said the governments effort would be to minimise budgetary help even as critical support would continue.

 The second phase will involve restructuring of five transport and two power companies. They guzzle huge amounts from the state exchequer every year, especially the transport units.

 It is not possible to discontinue the entire assistance as there are service components that the government will continue to offer. We are trying to make the system efficient to stop waste, Sen told The Telegraph.

 The second phase kicks off in October with a study to determine the ways and means to restructure these units.

 The study will be completed by March and the actual process may begin in the next financial year.

 The first phase of restructuring of 16 companies has resulted in savings of Rs 40 crore annually so far. After the first phase is over, it is expected to go up to Rs 60 crore.

 The first phase saw an expenditure of around Rs 225 crore with the Department for International Development (DFID) putting in Rs 200 crore.

 The second phase will call for expenses worth Rs 1,700 crore involving 80,000 employees compared with 10,000 in the first phase. After successful implementation of both the phases, the government will save close to Rs 560 crore.

 Sen said the Bengal government has initiated preliminary discussion with DFID and the World Bank for grants.

 The state has sent a concept paper to the department of economic affairs (DEA), ministry of finance, explaining the second phase. 

 The state is expecting the Centre to approve the fund-raising programme by the month-end.

 Great Eastern Hotel

 The new joint venture partner for Great Eastern Hotel will be known by October 31. The bid will close on October 21 and the rest will be formalised in the next 10 days. The state will hold 10 per cent in the company. It has given an early settlement scheme to all existing employees.

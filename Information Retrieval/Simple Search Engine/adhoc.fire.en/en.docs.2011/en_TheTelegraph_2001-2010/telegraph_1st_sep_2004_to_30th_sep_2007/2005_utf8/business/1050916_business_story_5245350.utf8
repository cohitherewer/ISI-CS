 CESC, Jharkhand in pact 

 ANUPAM SHESHANK

 Ranchi, Sept. 15: CESC Ltd, an RPG group company, today sealed its offer to set up three power plants in Jharkhand with a combined generating capacity of 1,000 MW. 

 RPG group vice-chairman Sanjiv Goenka said he had met chief minister Arjun Munda barely 10 days ago in Calcutta and was enthused by his dynamism. The MoU had been drafted and agreed upon in less than 10 days, he pointed out, and declared this will be the groups first, but not the last, investment in Jharkhand.

 Goenka said the RPG group would explore possibilities of investing in other areas as well. CESC, he pointed out, has the experience of supplying power to both Calcutta and Noida and also has diversified interests.

 The government had offered CESC three sites in Godda, Latehar and Chandil, besides a coalmine in Godda, for the three units ? one with an installed capacity of 500 mw and the other two with 250 mw each, he said.

 The site will be finalised within six months, he assured, and the project completed in two phases. The first 250-mw unit will be commissioned by January 2010 and the second by December 2011.

 The RPG group is committed to the project, he added.

 LIC plans combo policy

 New Delhi, Nov. 23 (PTI): As part of its golden jubilee bash, the Life Insurance Corporation is coming out with a unique policy that will have four features ? whole-life, money-back, endowment and maturity repayment.

 The state-owned insurer also plans to foray into health insurance and build more homes for elders, LIC chairman A.K. Shukla said on the sidelines of the Ficci conference here today.

 To double its business this year and mop up over Rs 1,00,000 crore in premium income, the state-owned insurer will launch Bima Bachat in January. This will be the third scheme in a row this fiscal after Bima Gold and Jeevan Plus.

 The new policy will not only target domestic consumers but also NRIs, who will redeem their Indian millennium bonds (IMD) in December.

 We are eager to tap the redemptions of IMD through the new scheme, Shukla said. Overseas branches of LIC may come up with special schemes depending on the regulations of that country to tap the money coming out of the deposit scheme. 

 LICs decision to tap IMD redemption worth $7 billion or over Rs 30,000 crore will surprise SBI and other banks, who have been so far alluring people to invest the withdrawals from LIC policies into their deposit schemes. 

 The insurer will offer the benefit of capital gains along with insurance cover.

 On overseas operations, Shukla said: We are going slow on the Saudi venture as some of the regulations have changed after we filed for licence. In Nepal and Sri Lanka, LIC had expansion plans but they were disrupted due to political upheaval.

 At home, the insurer is planning to expand the operations of LIC care homes, which build cheap dwelling units for elders.

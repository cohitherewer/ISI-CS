 L amp;T net soars 85%

 Mumbai, May 27 (PTI): Larsen amp; Toubro has posted a robust growth in net profit despite the pressure on margins. The companys earnings rose 84.67 per cent at Rs 983.85 crore for the fiscal ended March 31 compared with Rs 532.75 crore a year ago.

 The board has recommended a final dividend of Rs 17.50 per share of Rs 2 each in addition to the dividend of Rs 10 per equity declared in October 2004, L amp;T chairman and managing director A. M. Naik told reporters here today.

 Total income, including the share of profit from integrated joint-ventures, grew to Rs 13,807.42 crore last fiscal against Rs 10,006.59 crore in the previous year, he said.

 The engineering major has posted a net profit of Rs 333.68 crore for the fourth quarter ended March 31 against Rs 286.16 crore in the year-ago period. Total income stood at Rs 4,388.02 crore compared with Rs 3,695.69 crore in the same quarter of the previous fiscal. 

 L amp;T has to sacrifice margins for building the brand overseas, especially in West Asia. We are expecting margins to be back to normal in few years, Naik said.

 The engineering and construction (E amp;C) segment booked new orders worth Rs 13,301 crore, up 14 per cent over the previous year. Of these, exports accounted for Rs 1,692 crore, constituting 13 per cent of the orders booked in 2004-05, he said.

 The E amp;C segment registered revenues of Rs 3,771 crore during the fourth quarter. For the full year, revenues stood at Rs 11,430 crore, up 39 per cent over the previous year. Exports during the quarter and for the full-year amounted to Rs 687 crore and Rs 2,355 crore respectively, Naik said.

 He said the order backlog is at Rs 17,604 crore as on March 31 with a 7 per cent growth rate.

 However, we are concerned over the rising prices of cement and steel. The company is factoring in these aspects while estimating the project cost, he said.

 The company expects an 18 per cent growth in order booking in 2005-06, he said.

 L amp;T is sourcing raw materials from China to remain competitive amidst the rising commodity prices. It is also exporting hi-tech petroleum and reactor-related products, he added. We are establishing offices in China, Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi and Dubai for bidding for various small projects.

 Rupee slides to 43.85

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 5: It was not the equity market alone that had a turbulent day. The forex and money markets also experienced some bearish disturbances with the rupee plummeting by over 31 paise against the dollar. The currencys fall was initially trigerred by an appreciating dollar overseas and the share descent only heightened its woes.

 The Indian currency closed at 43.85 against the greenback, sharply lower from its previous close of 43.54. 

 Snippets from the US Federal Reserve meeting on Tuesday, which expressed concern over a weak greenback leading to higher inflation, triggered the dollar?s climb against other global currencies, particularly the euro. 

 While this meant a strong possibility of the Fed raising interest rates aggressively to counter inflation, it saw the dollar hitting a three-week high against the euro.

 The dollar?s rise was initially responsible for the rupee?s decline. The currency had opened distinctly weak at 43.75 per dollar. 

 However, it dropped further after the equity market went for a free fall as foreign institutional investors sold heavily. 

 Record purchases made by these investors ? around $9 billion in the equity markets ? during the last calendar year was one of the principal reasons that saw the rupee appreciating consistently against the dollar. It had consequently gained by 4.93 per cent.

 Analysts said if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates earlier than expected, money will flow overseas, thus hitting the Indian currency. 

 ?The rupee opened with a huge gap and this was initially due to the dollars rally against other global currencies. There were concerns about FII inflows into stock markets,? said a treasury chief from a leading private sector bank. 

 However, the dollars rally is not the beginning of a reversal of its downtrend, he added. ?Out here, we will be more glued to the behaviour of foreign institutional investors and how they behaved on Wednesday,? he further pointed out.

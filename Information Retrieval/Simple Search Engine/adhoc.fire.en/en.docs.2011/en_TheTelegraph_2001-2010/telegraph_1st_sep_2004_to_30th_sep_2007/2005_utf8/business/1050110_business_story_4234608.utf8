The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 SWC unit valuation to be uncorked

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Wazir: Wait and watch

 Mumbai, Jan. 9: The Shaw Wallace top brass will this week deliberate McKinsey?s valuation of its liquor business and bids from suitors.

 It is believed that Komal Wazir, one of the three daughters of Manu and Vidya Chhabria, will reveal her intentions for Shaw Wallace Distilleries. Komal has been the hands-on manager at Shaw Wallace ever since her father gave her key responsibilities. Merchant bankers say Komal might ultimately turn out to be a frontrunner for SWC?s liquor business. The firm?s beer unit has been hived off into a venture with SAB Miller.

 Seeking bids is a part of the valuation exercise, sources say. ?It?s still early days. And things are very fluid,? the sources in the merchant banking industry revealed.

 The liquor industry has viewed the calling of bids with a degree of disbelief. Many believe it is highly unlikely that the Chhabrias will sell off their mainline activity.

 The January 12-14 meeting of the Jumbo group in Dubai has raised a lot of curiosity and speculation within the industry, given that Shaw Wallace Distilleries is on the agenda.

 ?We are yet to see what?s on offer,? a merchant banker said. The valuation exercise comes after Bhavika Godhwani, the eldest of Chhabria?s three daughters, staked her claim to the group?s assets. This has fired speculation that the valuation is to settle the rivalry between the siblings ? Bhavika, Komal and Kiran. However, sources say Bhavika has been pacified now.

 Komal might take leading spirits multinational Kyndal along if she decides to snap up SWC?s liquor business, sources say. Her good rapport with Kyndal ? which has a marketing alliance with Shaw Wallace ? will help.

 Among the suitors are Ramesh Vangal, who spawned his own liquor business in India after helping Seagram and other foreign liquor conglomerates gain a foothold here. SWC?s arch-rival, UB Group, and its chairman, Vijay Mallya, have kept themselves from the bidding; while Radico Khaitan has not revealed its cards yet. 

 Shaw Wallace Distilleries is the country?s second-largest spirits company with annual sales of nearly 15 million cases. It trails leading player UB Spirits Division, which closed 2003-04 with sales of 35 million cases. 

 If the Jumbo group goes ahead with the sale, it would change the face of the Indian liquor industry and the destiny of Shaw Wallace, which Manu Chhabria acquired from R. G. Shaw and Sime Derby in 1985. It was the first in the series of fast-track acquisitions he made after establishing the Jumbo group in Dubai in 1974. 

 His youngest daughter, Kiran, a director in charge of marketing and communications at Jumbo Electronics, is involved with the Dubai operations.

 Bharti to join listing parade

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Talk it out

 New Delhi, Feb. 18: Bharti Tele-Ventures is preparing to join a horde of Indian companies that are seeking to list on the US stock exchanges.

 ?We will go to the markets to get more money, both equity and debt. We are planning to list ourselves on the American bourses,? Sunil Bharti Mittal, chairman of the Bharti group, told CNN on its Talk Asia programme.

 This isn?t the first time that Mittal has spoken about a global issue: he has articulated in the past the idea of floating an issue of American Depository Rights (ADRs).

 But this time Mittal?s statement takes on added significance since it comes just a fortnight after the government lifted the cap on foreign direct investment in telecom to 74 per cent from 49 per cent.

 ?We will go out and list our stock on overseas bourses,? said a senior Bharti group executive. ?We are already following the International Accounting Standards (IAS) in addition to the US? Generally Accepted Accounting Practices (GAAP). quot;

 Senior officials from the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and the London Stock Exchange have been visiting India in recent months to persuade Indian companies to list on bourses abroad. Already Tata Steel has announced its intention to list on the NYSE which could be followed by two others in the stable ? Tata Sons and TCS. ICICI Bank today received an approval from the government to float its ADS issue.

 A telecom analyst with PricewaterhouseCoopers said, ?The Indian companies had been waiting for the opportunity to get the right price and, importantly, international recognition. Many of them were planning to list abroad but then the dotcom bubble burst and they backed out.?

 ?Among telecom operators, Hutch has already made the right noises with the recent consolidation of its parent company and the restructuring of the Indian arm. They are set to go for an IPO anytime next fiscal. While Bharti had stated its plans to get listed abroad during its IPO, it would be the right time to get listed as the environment in India and abroad are conducive ? both in terms of the exposure and price, quot; he added.

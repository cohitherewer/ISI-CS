 Qwest delivers final offer

 Chicago, April 4 (Reuters): Qwest Communications International Inc, once again in merger discussions with takeover target MCI Inc, on Monday said it had delivered signed financing commitments regarding a potential transaction to MCI?s board.

 Denver-based Qwest said in a statement that it has provided to MCI a merger agreement that Qwest is prepared to sign. Qwest said MCI has not agreed to this offer but that it represents a ?superior proposal?.

 MCI said on Friday that it had agreed to reopen merger talks with Qwest. 

 The long-distance phone company has already agreed to be acquired under a sweetened bid from Verizon Communications Inc.

 Qwest has also hired a proxy advisor, the Altman Group, that could help it take its takeover effort directly to MCI?s shareholders.

 Easier FDI norms 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 5: The government has formed a group of ministers to simplify foreign direct investment (FDI) procedures and rationalise the ceiling for various sectors to attract larger inflows.

 The GoM, headed by Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar, was constituted on December 1 after the approval of the cabinet. The GoM includes finance minister P. Chidambaram, commerce minister Kamal Nath, communications and IT minister Dayanidhi Maran and minister of mines Sisram Ola.

 The GoM will cover all sectors that are currently receiving FDI, department of industrial policy and promotion secretary Ajay Dua said.

 He, however, clarified that the GoM would not cover FDI in retail as the government was yet to decide on allowing investments in this area.

 Dua had told CEOs last month at the India Economic Summit that the government might do away with procedures that require investments to be cleared by two official bodies.

 He had said wherever investments are already being vetted by Sebi, IRDA, RBI and other regulators, it might do away with procedures that require investments to go through the process again under the FIPB.

 While promising to open up more sectors to foreign investments, Chidambaram had also told at the summit that FDI and higher investment in infrastructure and farm sectors were key to sustaining high growth.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Change in the air

 Mumbai, Dec. 26: The promoters holding in Reliance Industries (RIL) is being realigned as the countdown begins to January 25, which has been set as the record date for the demerger of the Rs 100,000- crore empire. The company has seen a flurry of block deals involving entities that are listed promoters of the company.

 The promoters of RIL together hold 12.64 per cent in the petrochemicals-to-textiles conglomerate. The Ambani family itself has a fairly small personal stake; the rest is with these entities.

 But there is an even larger group of entities which are clubbed under the rubric persons acting in concert and hold 34.11 per cent. It is these persons which are now selling their holdings to the entities that are listed as promoters.

 The large deals began soon after the company filed a certified copy of the Mumbai high court order approving the demerger scheme with the registrar of companies on December 21.

 On that very day, 4.94 crore shares changed hands among these entities in a deal valued at over Rs 4,240 crore.

 Three entities ? Bhumika Trading, Eklavya Mercantile Pvt Ltd and Ekansha Enterprise Pvt Ltd which are listed as promoters and held just 63 shares each as of September 30 this year ? snapped up 4.95 crore shares from other group entities.What is more significant is that a few other entities (which have not been named) have acquired 8,19,600 shares (or 0.06%) from the market. 

 In a communication issued to stock exchanges today, RIL said Bhumika Trading Pvt Ltd, Ekalavya and Ekansha are Persons Acting in Concert (PAC) with one another within the meaning of Regulation 2(1)(e) of the Sebi (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 1997 ( quot;Takeover Regulations quot;). The acquirers and the sellers constitute a group within the meaning of Regulation (3)(1)(e)(i) of the Takeover Regulations, it added.

 Bhumika Trading, along with PACs, acquired 4,94,99,649 equity shares of RIL on December 21 through block deals on exchanges, being an inter-se transfer of shares amongst group, the notice said.

 Certain other persons had acquired 8,19,600 shares of RIL on December 21 from the open market. These were creeping acquisitions under Regulation 11(1) of the takeover regulations. Mavens from the stock market expect a few more block deals until January 17 ? the last day till which transactions will be taken into account for deciding who benefits from the demerger.

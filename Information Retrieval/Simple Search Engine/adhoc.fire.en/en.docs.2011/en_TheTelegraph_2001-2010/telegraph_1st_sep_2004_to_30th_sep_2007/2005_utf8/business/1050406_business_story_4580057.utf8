 Fresh ADR flotation on Bharti roster

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, April 5: Bharti Tele-Ventures plans to come out with a sponsored American depository receipts (ADR) issue. The company will decide on the size of the issue on April 27. 

 Bharti hopes to spend $850-900 million as capital expenditure in 2005-06 to meet the growing demand for mobile phone services in the country, Akhil Gupta, joint managing director, said today. 

 AirTel today launched the country?s first stock and portfolio tracker on the mobile in association with the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).

 ?The board meeting to be held later this month will assess the possibilities of a sponsored ADR. The company will examine how many shareholders are willing,? he said. 

 Warburg Pincus, which holds 5.8 per cent in Bharti Tele, may participate in the proposed sponsored ADR, Gupta said. 

 On Bharti?s capex plan of $850-900 million in this fiscal, Gupta said two-thirds of the capital outlay will be used to expand mobile phone services, while a third will be spent on other businesses. 

 Up to December 31, 2004, Bharti had spent Rs 3,300 crore as capital expenditure.

 Gupta said the company has no plans to raise fresh equity to fund its expansion. However, it may raise some debt.

 Basel norms to spur bank mergers

 Mumbai, March 30: Fitch Ratings today said the Indian banking system is in the middle of a transition from being relatively weak to moderately healthy. It also projected that consolidation is set to take place in the environment created by the proposed Basel II norms.

 In a special report titled ?Indian Banks: Improved Performance in Recent Years?, Fitch has observed that asset quality concerns have receded through a combination of non-performing loan (NPL) write-offs, recovery efforts and improved credit origination processes. The reported net NPL ratio of the banking system has halved between 2001-02 and 2004.

 It said the domestic banking sector?s performance has improved in recent years, accompanied by tighter prudential norms and increased disclosure requirements.

 ?Not only have banks seen a significant improvement in asset quality because of their robust performance in recent years, this has been bolstered by capital infusions in a buoyant market. Banks are now focused on improving their competitiveness and quality of earnings, backed by ongoing investment in technology and risk management systems,? it said. 

 The proposed Basel II guidelines will result in prioritising capital raising. This, coupled with a growing need for scale, may well trigger some sort of consolidation in the industry, Fitch added.

 According to Fitch managing director Amit Tandon, while the improvement in the NPL scenario is noteworthy, banks will need to continue upgrading their credit appraisal and monitoring systems to handle the rapidly-growing consumer loans business, besides managing their existing corporate and SME loans. 

 He, however, said the restructured performing loans remain a weak link. While many of these restructured loans are from the commodities business, which have benefited from an upturn in the global commodity prices, a few large loans still remained vulnerable and may become non-performing in future.

 Fitch projected that the asset quality of Indian banks will remain generally stable or improve slightly as the new NPL formation rate has slowed over the last two to three years.

 It also said after soaring during the last two years (2002-03 and 2004), profitability is currently under pressure on account of falling trading income in a rising interest rate environment. 

 In such an environment, banks have been trying to develop other non-interest income streams, leading to fee income assuming significance.

 The new private sector banks have taken advantage of the emerging opportunities in this area, including distribution of third-party investment and insurance products and other emerging wealth management opportunities. 

 While the private sector banks are also depending on technology as a key differentiator, their public sector counterparts are trying to catch up with them. Moreover, the staff, with selling and marketing skills, is also being retrained.

 The banking system is fragmented with a median asset size of $5 billion, and most banks are relatively small by global standards.

 ?With competition intensifying, banks have started recognising the importance of scale in their operations,? Fitch said while adding that future mergers among healthy government banks are expected to create a few ?national champions?, who would lead the systems ongoing migration to increased health.

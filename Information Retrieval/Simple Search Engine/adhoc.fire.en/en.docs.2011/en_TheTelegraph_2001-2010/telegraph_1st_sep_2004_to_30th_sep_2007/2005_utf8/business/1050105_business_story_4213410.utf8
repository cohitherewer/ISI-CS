 Minnows lobby for ADC

 New Delhi, Jan. 4: The minnows are fighting for their rights. Small telecom players like Himachal Futuristic Communications Ltd Infotel and Shyam Telecom want a special dispensation so that they can continue to get the ADC benefice.

 ADC stands for access deficit charge ? a fee that all telecom operators pay fixed-line operators to enable them to provide telephony services in rural and inaccessible areas. The major chunk of this collection has gone to Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) but a little bit has also trickled down to the private fixed-line players.

 But now the telecom regulator Trai has sparked consternation by floating for consideration a proposal to stop private fixed-line players from dipping into the ADC kitty.

 HFCL Infotel and Shyam have now come up with an ingenious way to ensure that they keep getting the ADC benefit, while the larger fixed-line players like Reliance and Tatas lose out on the benefit.

 HFCL Infotel offers telecom services in Punjab, while Shyam Telecom offers it in Rajasthan.

 Currently, Trai is considering the aspect of ADC retention/payment on fixed-wireless connections.

 The two operators have pointed that the regulator should not impose a blanket ban on fixed-wireless connections, while reviewing the ADC retention/payment since the fixed-wireless phones offered by Reliance Infocomm and Tata Indicom are almost as good as mobile phones as they offer a ?mobility option?.

 Currently, telecom operators offering fixed-line phones use CorDECT technology developed by IIT Chennai, Fixed Wireless Terminals (FWT) and Fixed Wireless Phone (FWP) based on code division multiple access technology.

 An FWT consists of three units ? a base terminal unit consisting of antenna, electronics, and two interfaces that are fixed inside the customer premises. It weighs more than 1.5 kg.

 HFCL has claimed that FWTs of this kind have been deployed only for PCO connections and that too in locations which are difficult to reach through wireline or which are in the peripheral areas of the town.

 The FWP is an integrated unit that serves as the alternative to plain old telephone connections and is the most visible of the fixed wireless products offered in the market, for example Walky offered by Tata Indicom.

 The CorDECT consists of three units ? an ?Air Unit? consisting of an antenna and electronics, that is fixed on roof/outside the customer premises; a ?Ground Unit? inside the customer premises that is connected to the Air Unit through a cable of up to 25 metres; and third a normal push button telephone (PBT).

 According to a letter from HFCL Infotel to Trai, ?We believe that fixed line services of private operators ? both the wireline segment and fixed wireless segment ? should continue to retain/receive ADC as is the policy currently. If the ADC is denied to private sector fixed-line services, it could de-motivate investment in fixed-line services. Fixed-line services would then remain a monopoly service and quality of service would remain a unfulfilled agenda.? HFCL Infotel has 46 per cent fixed-wireless connections based on CorDECT. The company claimed that 26 per cent of their fixed-wireless connections are FWTs and have been deployed for PCO connections.

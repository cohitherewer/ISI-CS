 Trai move irks cell firms

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 4: Cellular operators are peeved at the telecom regulator?s decision not to share the data of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL), which is being used to determine the access deficit charge (ADC) for the public sector company.

 The ADC is a fee that cellular operators pay to fund those operators offering telecom service in rural and remote areas that are uneconomical.

 Responding to a consultation paper floated by the telecom regulator, Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), cellular operators today said that they felt being at a disadvantage because while the mobile operators were required to provide all possible inputs to the consultation, the regulator was willing to share the requested data.

 In a letter to Trai, the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) said, ?A full disclosure of all required information is absolutely essential to demonstrate and ensure that no player is disadvantaged or made to subsidise his competitor. quot;

 COAI director general T.V. Ramachandran said, quot;In view of the inexplicable reluctance of Trai to share the requested information with us, we are endeavouring through extraordinary measures to partially offset this disadvantage by researching other international practices in the matter. However, findings and results from this exercise are not yet available. quot;

 Attacking the consultation paper, the cellular operators have pointed out that the issues and principles raised in this review have already been responded to by all stakeholders in its previous consultation papers. The present consultation has neither recorded any new developments, nor provided any data that have necessitated the present review.

 ?To that extent we believe this present review exercise would be of limited value as it is largely a repeat of earlier issues and would thus elicit only a reiteration of earlier responses,? said the letter.

 The COAI has reiterated that ADC should be provided only to BSNL and that too, only for its rural wireline services, after adjusting for support from the USO fund. It argued that there is no justification to give ADC to other fixed operators as they are offering services only in the urban and semi-urban areas where tariffs are forborne and the issue of an access deficit does not arise. The apex organisation of cellular mobile operators demanded that a revenue sharing regime for ADC should instead be introduced with immediate effect.

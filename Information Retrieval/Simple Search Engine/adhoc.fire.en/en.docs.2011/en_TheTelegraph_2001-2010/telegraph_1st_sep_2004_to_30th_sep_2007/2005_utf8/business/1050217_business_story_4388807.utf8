 Citi plans to set house in order

 Prince: In control

 London, Feb. 16 (Reuters): Citigroup?s chief executive officer Chuck Prince outlined a five-point plan emphasising staff training and independent controls as the firm looks to respond to recent scandals, according to an internal memo.

 The move from the world?s largest bank follows a high-profile bond-trading debacle in Europe and the loss of its private banking licence in Japan.

 The memo, seen by Reuters, details increased focus on training, improved communications, development of talent, performance appraisals and compensation, and strengthened controls.

 All staff will have mandatory annual ethics training and the bank is to set up an ?ethics hotline? where staff can raise issues.

 Prince wants to strengthen the bank?s independent controls, putting extra resources into compliance and audit and create a new structure to be called the Independent Global Compliance function.

 It will happen throughout the company to support the business in their efforts to grow responsibly, minimise mistakes, and to ensure that when mistakes occur, they are handled appropriately, the memo said.

 The bank will also strengthen its rules on stock ownership, insisting its near 3,000 senior managers hold at least 25 per cent of the company shares they receive. Citigroup?s top tier of management is already required to keep 75 per cent of their stock.

 This memo follows a tour by Prince of many of his firm?s international offices, and says the visits are set to continue, with a series of so-called town hall meetings with employees.

 Senior management will also be subject to annual anonymous feedback from their staff. Moreover the appraisal process will be sharpened with a more consistent review process across the bank.

 Prince promises that the initiatives highlighted in his memo will be put into effect in the next 12 to 18 months. The former lawyer has been quick to criticise his company?s behaviour and apologise publicly for their effects.

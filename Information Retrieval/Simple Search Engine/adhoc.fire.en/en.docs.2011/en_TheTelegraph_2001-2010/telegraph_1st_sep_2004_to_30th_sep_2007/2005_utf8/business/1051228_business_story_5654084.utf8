 SBI Mutual readies launch bouquet

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Dec. 27: SBI Mutual Fund plans to expand its product portfolio by introducing new schemes every alternate month.

 We have identified various niche areas, which are untapped by mutual funds and investors will benefit from such schemes. Therefore, we have decided to launch a scheme every alternate month to offer a complete product portfolio to investors, said Sanjay Sinha, head of equities, SBI Mutual Fund.

 Currently, the fund house is offering two new products. It has already launched SBI Bluechip Fund, which will be available for initial subscription till January 20, and has submitted the initial draft prospectus for an arbitrage fund with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).

 We have also launched an offshore fund, SBI Resurgent India Fund. Currently, road shows are being organised to promote the fund, Sinha said.

 SBI Mutual also plans to launch global funds after the Reserve Bank and Sebi approve the expansion of investible universe of global stocks, which is currently restricted to about 40-45 stocks, Sinha said. We feel that the relaxation in global investments norms will come soon.

 In such a scenario, the global expertise of Societe Generale in asset management will be leveraged upon to manage those funds, Sinha added. Societe Generale Asset Management holds a 37 per cent stake in SBI Mutual Fund.

 At present, SBI Mutual is the seventh largest asset management firm in the country with total assets under management amounting to over Rs 10,800 crore as on November 30, 2005. It is also the third mutual fund house in terms of equity assets managed. The fund house has an investor base of over 15 lakh across 29 schemes.

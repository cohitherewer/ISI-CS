 Cup of cheer for tea growers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, April 7: Close to 3,000 tea growers and around 9,500 coffee estates are expected to receive financial assistance worth Rs 14 lakh and Rs 47.6 lakh, respectively, from the price stabilisation fund for the year 2004.

 The commerce ministry has categorised 2004 as a normal year for tea and coffee, as a result of which the compensation is small. Rubber has been put in the higher boom-year category.

 The government calculates the price spectrum band for each commodity based on the seven-year moving average of the international price. 

 The commodity is then categorised in the boom, normal or distress year category after comparing the average price for the year with the price spectrum band. 

 Payments from the fund are higher for the distress years, when prices of a particular commodity have been low. 

 In December, the government had set up an expert committee to improve the previous governments price stabilisation fund scheme to provide relief to small growers of tea, coffee, rubber and tobacco. 

 The NDA governments scheme had provided for an initial corpus of Rs 500 crore for the price stabilisation fund. 

 Commerce minister Kamal Nath had said in the Lok Sabha that an expert committee was being set up to review the scheme to make it more useful and attractive to the growers.

 Nath had made it clear that the issue of export subsidy for these commodities would be looked into keeping in view its WTO compatability.

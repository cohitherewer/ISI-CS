 Calcutta, March 16: Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC) plans to go overseas with other domestic banks as partners.

 ?Starting overseas operations requires substantial capital and it is difficult for a single bank to take the entire risk. We will team up with other banks so that the risk can be shared,? said B. D. Narang, chairman and managing director of OBC.

 ?We are in talks with various banks, some of whom have branches abroad and others who wish to venture out,? added Narang.

 ?Our focus is to tap the potential in West Asia and Africa. We have to realise that concentrating only on NRI base will not augment our business. We have to realise the local potential of these countries,? Narang said.

 The bank has filed a prospectus for its second public offering with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi). ?The issue is likely to hit the market in the first week of April once Sebi?s approval comes through, which is expected within three weeks,? said Narang.

 The bank would issue 5.80 crore equity shares of Rs 10 each and the price would be determined through the book-building route. ?We expect the price to be around Rs 300 per share,? said Narang.

 Post-issue, the government holding in the bank will be reduced to 51 per cent from 66 per cent. 

 The bank is raising capital to meet its business needs and comply with the stringent Basel-II norms, which will come into effect from March 2007.

 The offer will improve the bank?s capital adequacy ratio to 16 per cent from 9.16 per cent.

 The bank has appointed five merchant bankers ? DSP Merrill Lynch, Kotak Securities, Citigroup, ICICI Securities and Bajaj Capital to manage the public offer.

 GTB integration

 ?The integration process of Global Trust Bank (GTB) with Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC) would be completed by June 2006,? said Narang.

 GTB?s losses have been absorbed into the accounts of the bank. ?In the last two quarters, GTB had suffered a loss of Rs 65 crore and Rs 10 crore, respectively,? he said.

 Narang said GTB is expected to contribute Rs 350 crore to the profit of OBC in the next financial year.

 At the time of acquisition, OBC had inherited a loss of Rs 1,450 crore, which amounted Rs 1,225 crore net of capital and reserves.

 Some of the steps taken for full integration with OBC were those of merging the balance sheets of the two entities at both the head office and branch levels, and addressing the staff issue by engaging the National Institute of Bank Management (NIBM).

 Narang told reporters that till date, OBC have been able to recover cash worth Rs 140 crore, while accounts worth Rs 50 crore have been upgraded from doubtful to standard. 

 Narang added that the bank was hopeful of recovering Rs 450 crore as compromise settlement. However, there would be no compromise on the principal amount.

 He added that criminal action has been initiated against some account holders. Around 17 complaints have been filed against 30 companies, which would help the bank realise Rs 730 crore.

 ?The government has also helped us by amending the Income Tax Bill and allowing us income tax exemption of Rs 300 crore,? said Narang.

 Eastern expansion

 OBC is in expansion mode in the east.

 ?We plan to expand our presence in the east through the organic route,? said Narang.

 ?The region is witnessing increased economic activities and there is a lot of scope for business growth in eastern and north-eastern parts of the country,? mentioned Narang.

 ?At present, we have 70 branches in the region and plan to add another 50 more. We have already applied to the Reserve Bank for grant of license for opening such branches,? added Narang.

 The bank has opened a regional office at Bhubaneswar, to cater to the states of Orissa, Jharkhand and Bihar. The regional office in Calcutta caters to the state of Bengal and the entire north-eastern states, explained Narang.

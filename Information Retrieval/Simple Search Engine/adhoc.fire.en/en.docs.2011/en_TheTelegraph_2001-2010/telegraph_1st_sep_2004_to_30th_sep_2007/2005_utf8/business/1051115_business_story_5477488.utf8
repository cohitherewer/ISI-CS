 Sebi nixes Delhi bourse plan

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 14: The Delhi Stock Exchange today decided to withdraw its proposed resolution to divest a 51 per cent stake in favour of strategic investors, following a strict directive issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India.

 The board has decided to withdraw the resolution following the Sebi directive, a DSE member told The Telegraph after the extraordinary general meeting (EGM) here. 

 In its letter dated November 4 to the DSE board, Sebi had stated that under the Securities Contract (Regulation) Act and guidelines on demutualisation of bourses, majority holding in a bourse can be divested only through the public offer route and not through a strategic sale or private placement.

 Since the Sebi letter is addressed to the board of directors, all directors, including public nominees and Sebi nominees, will be held responsible in case the stock exchange goes ahead with its proposed divestment of the 51 per cent stake through a strategic sale, stated the letter.

 DSE had convened the EGM as well as the annual general meeting today. The resolution to sell 51 per cent through a strategic sale was on the agenda. However, in the light of the Sebi directive, it has been dropped, a DSE member said.

 At the meeting, the board has also decided to hold fresh elections for constituting a new board. Two of the four members have tendered their resignations from the board today. Other members were not present, but should send in their resignations shortly, said a DSE official.

 The proposed resolution was to have sought the shareholders approval at the EGM to divest a 51 per cent stake at Rs 37.5 crore, which is the minimum valuation, or more to a strategic investor. A former DSE board member, who did not wish to be named, said the Sebi directive is a lesson for other regional bourses as well.

 The DSE strategic sale, if it were to go through, may have acted as a precedent for other bourses. There is always the potential of having a number of corporatised and demutualised bourses to be run by private promoters. This would not have augured well for the growth of capital markets in the country, he said.

 Recently, a report stating that Anil Ambani was interested in acquiring a strategic stake in the BSE had caused a flutter. The BSE management, however, had issued a swift clarification to the contrary.

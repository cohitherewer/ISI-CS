 Coal mines abroad on acquisition radar

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 Jain: Eye on input

 New Delhi, May 25: SAIL is keen on buying stakes in coal mines in Russia, Australia and Indonesia. 

 We are looking at prospects in these three countries, chairman V. S. Jain told The Telegraph. 

 However, the company has already rejected offers from two mines in Australia and Indonesia after a due diligence exercise. 

 They did not have the kind of reserves we are looking for, Jain said. SAIL is not looking at China or Eastern Europe yet. Nor are we looking at steel mills abroad because that does not make sense when the whole world is trying to come here to sell steel, he said.

 The Telegraph had caught up with Jain just a few days before his companys results were released. He looked happy about the impending results which he knew were going to be better than ever before. However, he looked a little perplexed by the turn of events at SAIL, which had come under a cloud over spot coal purchases made last year after its Australian suppliers backed on the grounds that their mines were flooded.

 Coal shortage forced the steel major to ration the supplies till it met its requirements through spot purchases. A controversy has raged over the prices at which the coal was bought. 

 Coal is now the biggest worry for SAIL. The firm has to sign contracts for future needs. 

 It needs to finalise long-term coal purchases by June even as it hunts for equity in mines abroad. Most ventures abroad will be explored by SAIL in partnership with BHP with which it has a tieup. Jain is also in talks with international bankers who are acting as investment scouts for him. Global bankers often have more information on such things, he said.

 Buying into coking coal mines abroad is a necessity for SAIL as India does not have high-grade varieties of the feedstock. SAIL has already made up its mind not to bid for coal mines that the government may open up in eastern India to steel, cement and power generation companies. 

 The alternative to mine equity is to enter into long-term contracts. But caught in the middle of a controversy over the pricing of imported coal, SAIL would obviously prefer to have its own mines. 

 However, that is a luxury SAIL does not expect too soon. Jain said, We are looking at both right now ? long term contracts and equity. Perhaps we will have to take both.

 PM scores higher on India Inc scale

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Singh: Good work

 New Delhi, May 19: India Inc has reposed greater confidence in the Manmohan Singh-led UPA government than the Prime Minister himself did. 

 In a business barometer survey conducted by Assocham, industry leaders have given the UPA government a score of 65 on 100. This is higher than the 60 points that the Prime Minister gave his team on the completion of one year of the Congress-led government.

 According to the top 250 CEOs and CMDs who have responded to the survey, the present government has got the industry?s vote for financial sector reforms, capital market revamp, industrial growth and external sector measures despite inflationary pressures.

 However, India Inc has rated the government?s performance poorly in areas such as divestment, labour and power reforms and infrastructure development.

 Of the 250 corporate honchos, nearly 188 rated the present government as ?good?.

 Of the 12 parameters, the respondents ranked the government ?good? on seven.

 The parameters on which the industry leaders voted were agricultural growth, industrial performance, labour reforms, infrastructure development, power and financial sector reforms, foreign direct investment, inflation and energy prices, interest rate stance, public sector divestment, capital market and export promotion. 

 According to the survey, 78 per cent of the respondents acknowledged the governments financial sector reforms. Measures like the introduction of value-added tax (VAT) and allowing 74 per cent foreign direct investment in private sector banks earned kudos for the government.

 The industrial production in the first year of the Manmohan Singh government grew by 8 per cent in 2004-05 against 7 per cent in the previous year.

 The survey expressed satisfaction at the robust growth of 8.8 per cent shown by the manufacturing sector in 2004-05 compared with 7.4 per cent in the previous year.

 Seventy nine per cent of the respondents gave credit to the government for providing an enabling environment for growth in the industrial sector. 

 An overwhelming 89 per cent of the industry leaders voted for finance minister P. Chidambaram and the Reserve Bank of India ?for a deft handling of the interest rate situation in spite of the inflationary pressures?. 

 Despite opposition from the Left parties on raising FDI in sectors like telecom, banking and aviation, the government has kept its promise on financial sector reforms, said the survey.

 On this front, another 60 per cent of the respondents cast their votes in favour of the UPA government. The survey said, ?A lot of issues like the public-private participation need to be sorted out before plans like special purpose vehicles (SPVs) announced in the last budget can take off.?

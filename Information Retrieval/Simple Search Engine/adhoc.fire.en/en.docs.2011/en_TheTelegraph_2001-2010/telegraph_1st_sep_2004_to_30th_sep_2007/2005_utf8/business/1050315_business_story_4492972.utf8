 IBM snaps up software facility

 New York, March 14 (Reuters): International Business Machines Corp has agreed to buy software maker Ascential Software Corp for $1.1 billion to bolster its information integration business, the firms said on Monday.

 The deal values Ascential at $18.50 a share, an 18 per cent premium to its closing price of $15.70 on the Nasdaq stock market on Friday. Ascential shares jumped to $18.21 in pre-open trade.

 Ascential, based in Westboro, Massachusetts, provides systems that help companies integrate complex data to streamline operations.

 Armonk, New York-based IBM said the acquisition would complement and strengthen its information integration business, a unit that produced triple-digit growth in 2004.

 ?Information integration is an important enabler of an on-demand business strategy, and customers are increasing their investments in software that allows them to rapidly analyse, consolidate and extract value from the business data,? said IBM software executive Steve Mills. Ascential grew rapidly in 2004, with revenue rising 46 per cent to $271.9 million and more than 3,000 customers and partners across all major industries.

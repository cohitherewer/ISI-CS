 Mark to market

 New Delhi, July 19: The finance ministry has cleared Bank of Barodas fresh stock offer of Rs 1,500 crore.

 The flotation of 7.1 crore shares will bring down the governments holding in the bank from 66 to 53 per cent. The issue, which is due in September, will fund an expansion drive and help shore up the capital adequacy ratio of the profit-making PSU bank. 

 Sources in the bank said BoB may price its public offering at a 5-10 per cent discount to the present market rate of Rs 209.

 The price of shares issued by BoB will be determined through a book-building process. Sources said they expect the issue to fetch the bank close to Rs 1,500 crore. A significant portion of the offer will be reserved for small investors, they said.

 BoB plans to expand its presence in the US, UK, UAE, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Male, Bangladesh and West Indies. The bank hopes to secure 25 per cent of its business overseas. 

 In the domestic market, BoB is planning to tie up with another bank and a foreign insurer to enter the life insurance business. 

 The bank also plans to come up with money malls to boost retail loans. It will add 500 ATMs this fiscal and introduce 12-hour banking services in 11 cities and 24-hour services in four metros. 

 BoB today paid a final dividend of Rs 62.72 crore for 2004-05.

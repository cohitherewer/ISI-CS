 Balrampur Chini to raise FII cap to 40%

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 14: Balrampur Chini Mills Ltd (BCML) will raise the foreign investment ceiling to 40 per cent from the existing 24 per cent.

 This will allow more foreign institutional investors (FIIs) and non-resident Indians (NRIs) to buy the company?s shares.

 At present, FIIs and NRIs together hold 10.15 per cent of BCML. 

 The company, in its board meeting on February 5, approved a preferential issue of 8.34 per cent of the expanded equity to two FIIs ? Citicorp International Finance Corporation and New Vernon Bharat Ltd. After the preferential issue, foreign holding in the company will be 18.49 per cent.

 Market observers said a higher cap will be positive for the stock, which has already seen hectic activity last fortnight. ?People will start buying its shares in anticipation of increased FII activities,? they said.

 BCML has convened an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) of its shareholders on March 4 to pass the special resolution.

 Moreover, the company will seek shareholder?s nod for the private placement of 19,33,000 shares at Rs 575 apiece to raise about Rs 113 crore to fund its expansion plan and a stock split. For each share of Rs 10, existing shareholders will get 10 shares with a face value of Re 1.

 BCML plans to invest Rs 400 crore to set up two greenfield sugar complexes. The expansion would be funded by the preferential issue, debt and internal accrual. Given that a debt-equity mix of 1:1 is followed in the sugar industry, BCML could raise about Rs 200 crore as debt.

 BCML is setting up a greenfield sugar plant in Uttar Pradesh with a capacity of 7,000 tonnes crushed per day (TCD). It will also increase the crushing capacities at various existing units by 4,000 TCD. The entire project cost was around Rs 200 crore.

 The company is also looking at setting up another greenfield sugar complex in Uttar Pradesh.

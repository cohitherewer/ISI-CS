 Telecom thrives on cut-throat rivalry 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 8: Telecom subscribers in the country will cross the 100-million mark by the month-end.

 The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has said the telecom service during 2004-05 witnessed an unprecedented growth, driven by intense competition and aggressive pricing.

 Over 20.6 million telephones have been added during the April-February period of 2004-05. During February alone, more than 2.1 million connections were given by telecom service providers.

 As a result of this addition, the total number of phones has reached 97 million, taking the teledensity to 9.08 during 2004-05 compared with 7.17 at the end of the previous year.

 During 2004-05, teledensity increased by 1.91. The increase in teledensity during 50 years from 1948 to 1998 was only 1.92 per cent.

 Mobile phone subscribers increased from 33.6 million to more than 52.1 million during the year, a rise of 18.5 million. The number of mobile users has already exceeded fixed subscribers in the country in October 2004.

 The private sector has played a major role by accounting for 77.93 per cent of the expansion during the April-February period. It accounts for 46.11 million phones as on February 28, 2005 which is more than 47 per cent of the total phones in the country.

 The telecom regulator says, ?The ratio of the subscriber base of private sector companies to that of the public sector ones is 46:54. If the same growth pattern continues, the share of private companies is likely to exceed that of public companies by December 2005.?

 The regulator has said with reduction in mobile tariffs by 35 per cent during the year, India now offers cheapest mobile rates in the world.

 The subscriber base of Internet services during 2004-05 has increased by 25 per cent from 4.55 million to 5.65 million. 

 The broadband policy has set a target of 20 million subscribers by 2010, which will be 50 per cent of the total Internet user base in the country.

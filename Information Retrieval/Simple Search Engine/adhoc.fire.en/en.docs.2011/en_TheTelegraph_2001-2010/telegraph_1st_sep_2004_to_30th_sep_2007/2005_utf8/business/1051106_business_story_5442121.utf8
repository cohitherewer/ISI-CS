 Vanilla, Diet Coke lose fizz

 Bottled up

 New York, Nov. 5 (Reuters): Coca-Cola Company on Friday said it would phase out its Vanilla Coke, Vanilla Diet Coke and Diet Coke With Lemon beverages in the United States by end of this year. 

 The announcement came a day after Coca-Cola said it would phase out Vanilla Coke and Vanilla Diet Coke in the United Kingdom early next year. 

 The company said sales have declined.

 Coca-Cola shares were down 1.1 per cent in the afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

 The worlds largest soft-drinks maker added that it was planning to introduce Diet Black Cherry Vanilla Coke and Black Cherry Vanilla Coke in the US in January 2006.

 The company said Vanilla Coke, which was introduced in the US in 2002 and Diet Vanilla Coke in 2003, could return sometime in the future. Details about whether Diet Coke With Lemon, which made its US debut in 2001, would be brought back were not available.

 I dont know if we have ever taken out a flavour and brought it back to the market, but the landscape continues to change and we want to be as flexible as possible to adapt to the changing landscape, said Scott Williamson, a spokesperson for Coca-Cola.

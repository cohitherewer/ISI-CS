 November date for oil bonds

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Sept. 8: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today indicated that oil bonds worth Rs 10,000-15,000 crore to be issued to public sector oil companies are not likely to come before November as Parliaments approval is required.

 The bonds will be issued after getting Parliaments approval, Chidambaram told reporters on the sidelines of a function here.

 Petroleum secretary S.C. Tripathi had earlier said the bonds would be issued either at the end of this month or early next month. It now appears that oil companies will have to wait. 

 The oil bonds have to be issued after appropriation of the required amount from the consolidated fund of India, which requires Parliaments clearance. 

 Such amounts can be withdrawn only through the supplementary demands for grants. The grants are issued after Parliament approves them. The winter session of Parliament is expected to start around middle of November.

 The government had announced on September 6 that bonds are likely to be issued to downstream oil marketing companies like Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum, Hindustan Petroleum and IBP to compensate them for not raising the prices of domestic cooking gas and kerosene, despite the skyrocketing global crude prices.

 Oil companies will be losing Rs 15,000 crore on LPG and kerosene sales during the rest of the financial year. The bonds are expected to cover this loss, which will be issued by the finance ministry in consultation with the RBI. 

 The bonds will be in the form of IOU notes from the government, which oil companies can encash with banks or financial institutions at a discount. The rate of interest and maturity period of these bonds still have to be worked out.

 Although bonds will help oil companies improve their balance sheet or even increase their liquidity position, if required, the government might make a deferred payment. Hence, it will not impact the budget deficit during the current fiscal.

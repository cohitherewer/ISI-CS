 Calcutta, Sept. 2: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has expressed its desire to acquire the Bengal governments share in Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd (HPL).

 IOC chairman Sarthak Behuria said the companys objective was not to be solely a portfolio investor in HPL.

 We got into HPL to eventually take over the Bengal governments stake in the company if and when it is offered, Behuria said.

 IOC has about 7.5 per cent stake in the present equity of HPL for which it had paid Rs 150 crore.

 We are keen to run the company and expand it. We want to foray into petrochemicals, Behuria added.

 The IOC statement comes at a time when Purnendu Chatterjee of The Chatterjee Group (TCG), the joint venture partner in HPL, is locked in a legal battle with the Bengal government in the company law board (CLB) over allotting shares to IOC.

 TCG alleged that it had the pre-emptive right to any share allotment and should have been given the first right of refusal for the shares.

 It sought to stall the stake sale to IOC. Behuria claimed that the issue was closed as the company got the money and IOC the shares.

 The Bengal government had offered to sell its 43 per cent stake in HPL to TCG at Rs 28.80 per share. However, Chatterjee could not arrange the funds.

 After a months wait, Bengal decided to call off the plan to sell the stake to TCG.

 Bengal has, however, said it will exit from the company in the long run.

 HPL, located next to IOCs Haldia refinery, is a strategic fit to the oil marketing company. IOC has promised a significant investment at Haldia to turn the port town into a petrochemical hub on the east coast.

 IBP business

 IBP will hive off its cooking gas business to IOC even before the merger with the company. IBP has 3 lakh consumers. It is a huge burden on the company ? the only pure oil marketing firm in India ? to carry the loss it is suffering due to non-revision of prices.

 Behuria, who is also the chairman of IBP, said merger with IOC was a better option for the company. There is no need to change the merger ratio even after IBP suffered huge losses in the first quarter.

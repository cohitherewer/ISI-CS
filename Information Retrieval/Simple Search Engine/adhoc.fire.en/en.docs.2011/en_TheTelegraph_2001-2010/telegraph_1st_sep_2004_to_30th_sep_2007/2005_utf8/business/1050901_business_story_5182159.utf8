 GE Shipping sets sail with demerger

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 31: Great Eastern Shipping ? Indias largest private shipping giant ? is being carved up. GE Shipping, which is owned by the Sheth family, will be split into shipping and offshore divisions and managed by different branches of the clan. 

 The restructuring envisages the de-merger of the entire offshore business consisting of drilling services, marine logistics, marine construction and port/terminal services into a separate firm with retrospective effect from April 1.

 The de-merger will create two focussed companies ? one in shipping and the other in oilfield services, thereby helping to unlock value for shareholders, said chairman K.M. Sheth. 

 K.M. Sheths two sons ?Bharat and Ravi ? will run the shipping business. Their cousin, Vijay will have sole control of the offshore division which he established single-handedly back in the eighties. The oil business accounts for almost 20 per cent of GE Shippings total revenues of Rs 2,091 crore.

 The shareholding of the new company will mirror the shareholding in GE Shipping. Consequently, the share capital of GE Shipping will be commensurately reduced. 

 Speculation about the carve-up of GE Shippings businesses has been doing the rounds for several months. The Sheth family and the company vigorously denied the demerger possibility till last Saturday when they finally informed stock exchanges about a proposal to restructure Great Eastern Shipping.

 The board of GE Shipping met today and decided that the shares of the new company would be proportionately allotted directly to shareholders of GE Shipping under an arrangement that has yet to be formulated. 

 The board has appointed a committee of directors that will evaluate several parameters while working out a share swap ratio for the de-merger. The swap ratio is expected to be ready in two to three weeks. The committee will be advised by Kotak Mahindra. The GE Shipping stock rose today 1.52 per cent to Rs 193.55 from Tuesdays close of Rs 190.65. 

 Under wraps is the possible swap of equity stakes between the cousins. Thats in their personal family domain, said sources close to the promoters. 

 Industry circles say Bharat Sheth, who has got control of the larger pie of GE Shippings business, will eventually buy out Vijays stake in the shipping entity and will offer his stake in the offshore business to his cousin. Vijay may also get a cash component. 

 It is not yet known wholl get the portfolio investments made by the company. The company has investments in financial daily Business Standard and, even though it still isnt clear who might get this, analysts bet that it will go to Bharat and Ravi eventually.

 Given the growth momentum in offshore oil services, the new company will be able to harness the potential of this business, said K.M. Sheth.

 The great Indian ripoff

 Credit card issuers charge usurious rates of interest, have no transparency in their dealings and harass customers. Chandralekha Tulal builds a case for reining them in

 You get a call on your mobile and the voice on the other side offers you a credit card ? free of cost for the first year. 

 For the first two months, you receive statements showing no charges. However, when the third month bill comes, you find that you have been charged the annual fee.

 You call up the customer care number ? the only thing you can do in the event of such mishaps. There?s another painful experience as a new person attends your call every time you ring up.

 You keep parroting your story to every customer care person who attends your call with no solution in sight. The only information they can give is that you will have to write an official communication to the regional office but cannot give you the name or contact number of anyone at the top.

 You then turn into a zombie firing off letters and making frantic telephone calls to everyone you can think of. It?s a shaky course of action: at the end of it, you discover something that no one told you about when they conned you into applying for a credit card: the annual fee in the first year is waived only if you spend a certain amount on the card in the first three months. You are never told what that magic figure is: that?s top secret at the credit card company.

 Another person owns a silver credit card of a reputed private bank. But one day she receives a call from the bank informing her that her silver card stands cancelled and she is issued another card of the bank, which comes with some insurance scheme.

 She has no clue about what happened. She has not been approached by anyone from the bank; no one has informed her about the new card or its features and, most important, she never signed on any form requesting for the new card or cancelling the old one. 

 So, how did this happen? The best answer she can worm out of the customer care centre is that it is a ?machine-generated error?.

 Everyday we hear people complaining against the credit card companies and their ways of selling the cards and harassing the customers post sale.

 Again, at a time when the interest rates on all loans are hovering at their lowest levels in decades, the chargeable rate on credit cards continues to rule as high as 35 per cent (around 3 per cent monthly) compared with just 11.25 per cent in America and European countries.

 Another catch in the credit card business is the minimum monthly due, which means revolving of credit. This means you pay part of your bill (5 percent is the compulsory minimum) now and pay the rest later. 

 This may sound convenient, even good, but remember the revolving credit is not cool. It ends your period of free credit; once you start revolving your debt and till you clear your unpaid balance, every single payment you make using your card will be added to your loan amount and you will be charged interest on it.

 Finally, there?s just a possibility that some form of relief may be at hand for hassled and harried credit card users. For the first time, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has asked the Indian Banks? Association (IBA) and the large credit card issuers to evolve a code of conduct that will be voluntarily adopted by the banks.

 An RBI statement said it has been receiving a large number of complaints about harassment of customers, receiving unsolicited cards, wrongful activation of cards, lack of transparency in levying service charges and the absence of an effective grievance redressal machinery. 

 The apex bank is also concerned about the extortionist rate of interest charged by the credit card issuers.

 Last November, the RBI had asked banks issuing credit cards to be more receptive to customer complaints and constitute proper grievance redressal cells. Banks were also advised to issue an appropriate code of conduct to direct selling agents marketing their credit card products and cautioned them to take pre-emptive steps to prevent litigation. 

 Concerned about banks? retail lending, the RBI in its credit policy had increased the risk weightage on consumer credit, including personal loans and credit cards to 125 per cent from 100 cent. 

 The RBI has also set up a working group to draft a mechanism to address various issues relating to regulatory requirements for credit cards, which would look into aspects relating to customer protection and suggest measures for using cards in a safe, secure and customer-friendly manner.

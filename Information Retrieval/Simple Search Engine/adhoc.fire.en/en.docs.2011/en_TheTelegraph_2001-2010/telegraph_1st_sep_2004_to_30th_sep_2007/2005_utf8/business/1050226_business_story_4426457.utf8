 Tata Motors eyes stake in Spanish company

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 25: The board of Tata Motors has approved a proposal to pick up a 21 per cent stake in Hispano Carrocera S. A. (HC).

 The Spanish bus manufacturing company enjoys a 25 per cent local market share. Tata Motors will have the technology licence and brand rights from HC. The total deal, comprising equity, debt and technology licensing, will cost Tata Motors 12 million euros or Rs 70 crore. The company has the option to buy the entire stake of HC over a period of time.

 This is the second major international acquisition by Tata Motors following the takeover of the commercial vehicle facility of Daweoo in Korea for a consideration of Rs 465 crore last year.

 The Korean deal had given the company access to heavy-duty trucks, having a market in developed countries.

 The Spanish company is one a leading maker of bus and coach bodies in Europe with a production capacity of close to 2,000 units a year. It has industrial installations in two countries and commercial relations with more than 50 countries. 

 The Spanish market requires 1,000 city buses and 2,000 coaches every year.

 Ravi Kant, executive director (commercial vehicle), Tata Motors, said, ?This strategic alliance with HC will give us access to its design and technological capabilities to fully tap the growing potential of this segment in India and other export markets, besides providing us with a foothold in developed European markets.?

 Tata Motors does not have a bus-body building facility of its own and outsources the job to vendors in the unorganised sector.

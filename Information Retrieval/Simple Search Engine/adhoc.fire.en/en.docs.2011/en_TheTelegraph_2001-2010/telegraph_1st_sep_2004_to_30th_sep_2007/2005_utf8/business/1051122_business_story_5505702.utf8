 New Delhi, Nov. 21: The steering group on hydrogen headed by industrialist Ratan Tata has come up with a roadmap to launch 1 million hydrogen-fuelled vehicles on Indian roads by 2020 and generate 1,000 mw power through hydrogen-based plants. The plan entails an investment of Rs 25,000 crore.

 Presenting the national hydrogen energy roadmap to the minister for non-conventional energy sources, Vilas Muttemwar, Tata said: The whole world, and certainly India, will face increasing shortage of hydrocarbon and so we have to look at alternative forms of energy... The document reflects the problems and attempts to define a roadmap.

 However, he pointed out that a whole lot of problems existed relating to production, distribution and storage of energy from hydrogen. The implementation is complex and expensive. But we have to find solutions to these, he said.

 The roadmap proposed two major initiatives ? green initiative for future transport (GIFT) and green initiative for power generation (GIP) ? as part of its proposals.

 This roadmap for GIFT aims to develop and demonstrate hydrogen-powered engines and fuel cell-based vehicles ranging from two wheelers, cars, vans to buses through different phases of development.

 The GIP envisages developing hydrogen-powered turbines and fuel cell-based decentralised power generating systems with an aggregate capacity of 1,000 mw by 2020.

 The roadmap estimates that an investment of Rs 25,000 crore will be required to implement the project. While Rs 1,000 crore will be required for research and development, Rs 24,000 crore will be needed for creating infrastructure to produce, store, transport and distribute hydrogen to meet the requirements under the two initiatives.

 The roadmap has recommended a strong public-private partnership covering the total hydrogen energy system to implement its proposals.

 The National Hydrogen Energy Board, which prepared the roadmap, was constituted in October 2003 and the steering group was formed on February 23, 2004. 

 Members of the steering group included former Isro chairman K. Kasturirangan, Atomic Energy Commission chairman Anil Kakodkar, and chairmen of Indian Oil Corporation and Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd.

 The roadmap has discussed in depth different aspects of hydrogen energy, including production, storage, transport, delivery, applications. safety standards and codes.

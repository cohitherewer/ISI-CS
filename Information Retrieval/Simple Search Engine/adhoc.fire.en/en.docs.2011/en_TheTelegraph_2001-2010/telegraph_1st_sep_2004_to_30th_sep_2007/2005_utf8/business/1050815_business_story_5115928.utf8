 Italian firms size up Bengal

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 14: Italian investors are keen on investing in Bengal and Gujarat in the areas of agri-business, food processing, petrochemicals and power. 

 Over 50 medium and large Italian companies are looking at potential investments opportunities in these two states. There are some sectors which have growth potential in Bengal and are also on the priority list of Italian companies, said Raffaele Langella, head of economic and commercial section, Embassy of Italy. 

 Langella was addressing an interactive session on Emerging Business Opportunities in Calcutta jointly organised by the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham) and Bengal Peerless Housing Development Company.

 It is understood that Italian entrepreneurs held talks with both the governments of Bengal and Gujarat. 

 A delegation of 50 business leaders from Italy, led by the countrys minister of infrastructure, will visit India in the month of September. During the trip, they will negotiate proposals with the Indian industry, said Langella.

 According to him, another business delegation is also expected in the month of December. Possibly by then, total investment volumes will be finalised, he added.

 Approximately 600 Italian businessmen have already visited India between January and June this year. They held protected discussions with their Indian counterparts, exploring business opportunities in the country.

 Calcutta is turning out to be a preferred business destination for Italys future investments, encouraged by the responsible nature of corporate governance and the current entrepreneurial outlook of the Bengal government, said Langella. Italian companies may set up their shops in the Rs 250-crore multi-complex, Axis, at Rajarhat in Calcutta. These investments will primarily be in the area of IT and software, Langella added.

 Mobile users get welcome call

 Sweet buzz 

 New Delhi, April 15: The telecom regulator today allayed fears that mobile call costs for roaming subscribers would rise as a result of last week?s directive issued by it.

 The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) clarified that the access deficit charge (ADC) on roaming subscribers was not a fresh levy. 

 ADC is a charge that operators pay to fund those service providers who offer telecom service in rural and inaccessible areas at a higher infrastructure cost.

 The regulator has highlighted that the directive will attract 30 paise ADC only on intra circle (often referred as local area) calls made by national roaming subscriber (while roaming outside his home network) and terminating in a mobile phone in the visited service area. 

 A 30 paise per minute ADC is being charged by the operator for all other categories of calls ? like a call originating from a roaming subscriber and terminating in the fixed-line either in visited service area or in different service area or call originating from roaming subscriber and terminating in the mobile other than the visited service area.

 Moreover, cellular operators are also treating calls made by roaming users differently than calls originated by home-circle subscriber. There is adequate margin available with cellular operators to absorb this marginal impact as they are already charging about Rs 3-5 per minute from national roaming subscribers.

 ?In the present competitive arena, Trai is of the opinion that the minor change in case of calls originated from roaming mobile subscribers (while roaming outside their home network) and terminating in mobile subscribers in the visited service area is likely to have no impact on the domestic consumer roaming tariff even though tariffs are under forbearance (with specified ceiling),? Trai said in a statement.

 A Trai official said, ?The regulator has not increased the ceiling on national roaming tariffs. As far as the impact of ADC of Rs 3.25 per minute for international roaming subscribers is concerned, this will have no impact on domestic consumers.?

 This ADC is applicable only to those international subscribers whose home network is outside India. 

 Trai said there was already an exorbitant margin available with cellular operators as they were charging a very high airtime charges from international roaming subscribers for calls made by them while in India.

 Last week, the regulator also directed that telecom operators on whose network a roaming subscriber logs in will be responsible to collect the ADC and pay it to Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd.

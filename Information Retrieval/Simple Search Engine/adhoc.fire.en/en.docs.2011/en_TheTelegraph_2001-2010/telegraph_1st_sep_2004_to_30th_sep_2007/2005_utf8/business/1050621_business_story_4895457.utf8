 Centre opens door to Singapore banks 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 20: The government will grant special economic access to Singapore, including treating the Island Nation?s banks on a par with Indian ones, and scrapping duties on a host of goods. 

 India will ease investment rules for Singapore firms in local enterprise through a treaty. Singapore will, in turn, relax visa restrictions for Indian professionals.

 India has till now kept its banking industry protected from MNC encroachments despite pressures from the West to open up its lucrative financial retail market. The government has so far treated foreign banks differently while issuing branch licences or defining on areas of operations.

 The government?s move marks a significant policy change. Soon after the announcement today, Singapore?s DBS Bank made an open offer for up to 20 per cent in Cholamandalam Investment amp; Finance Company at Rs 150 per share.

 The government?s Left allies ? CPM and CPI ? have strongly opposed plans to open up the Indian financial markets to MNC banks. However, they have also been enthusiastic supporters of opening up trade with the Island Nation, which is one of Asia?s largest trading hubs. The bilateral Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement approved today allows three Singapore banks ? DBS , Overseas Chinese Banking Corp and United Overseas Bank ? national treatment, which means they can function as freely as local banks here.

 Indian banks in Singapore, which include State Bank of India, Bank of India, Indian Bank and Uco Bank, will receive similar treatment in that country, the treaty said. 

 Commerce minister Kamal Nath said the agreement is an integrated package comprising trade in goods and services, an agreement on investments and mutual recognition pacts in services, education, intellectual property rights and media. 

 India?s offer is categorised into four lists. This includes the early harvest programme for 506 tariff lines where customs duty would be eliminated immediately; the phased elimination and reduction tariff lines and the negative list of 6,551 lines where no concessions have been offered. 

 ?Singapore has offered entry to all products made in India at zero duty. This will help in developing supply chains from India,? he said.

 Assam gas cracker unit back on track

 S.P.S. PANNU

 GET CRACKING

 New Delhi, Sept. 18: The finance ministry has been asked to take a fresh look at the proposal for the Assam gas-cracker project following the PMOs intervention.

 The public investment board will consider the proposal next week, petroleum secretary S.C. Tripathi told The Telegraph. The plan has been prepared with a new set of assumptions, including waiving of excise duties and sales tax and supplying natural gas as feedstock at regulated Northeast prices, he added. The gas is expected to be drawn from the ONGC and OIL fields in the region.

 The Rs 5285-crore Assam gas-cracker project proposal had run into rough weather in May when the finance ministry had withheld its approval on the ground that it was not viable. According to the ministry, the Rs 1983-crore capital subsidy required for the project may not be justified as the cracker has a low employment potential. It had pointed out that if the same money was directly utilised for health, education and roads, it would benefit the region more.

 However, with the Planning Commission backing the project and the PMO stepping in, the proposal has once again shot into prominence.

 The finance ministry had wanted its petroleum counterpart and the department of chemicals and petrochemicals to submit their clear views on the relevance and viability of the project as it entails a large investment and has to be supported by huge subsidies and tax concessions.

 Finance ministry officials were not impressed by the presentation made by GAIL at an earlier meeting of the public investment board. The proposal had been cleared by both the petroleum ministry and department of chemicals and petrochemicals.

 The government, however, feels the free-trade agreement that is to be signed with Asean will impact the commercial viability of the project. Hence, it wants a financial analysis on the possibility of increased foreign competition due to the scaling down of import duties.

 GAIL has been asked to look into the feasibility of the project at a lower internal rate of return of 8 per cent instead of 12 per cent as this would lower the amount of capital subsidy required for it.

 As far as excise and sales tax waivers are concerned, GAIL officials feel that the Centre and state governments are not getting these taxes in any case and the only direct outgo from the government coffers would be the subsidy element.

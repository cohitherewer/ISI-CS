 Plan for Dubai tea auction put off

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Testing Times 

 Calcutta, March 13: Tata Tea, Eveready Industries India Limited, Warren Tea, Dhunseri, Duncans and Goodricke have shelved the plan to set up an auction centre in Dubai.

 Industry officials said traders in Dubai are not keen to spell out the price at which they want to buy Indian tea. They are asking Indian producers to send tea to Dubai.

 ?There should be a payment guarantee from traders in Dubai. We cannot afford to burn our fingers at a time when the industry is passing through a rough patch. Our exports are also not very encouraging,? said senior officials.

 The industry had thought that an auction centre in Dubai will help Indian producers access the markets in West Asia and North Africa (Wana) directly and get a better price for their tea. In 2004, the country exported 45 million kgs of tea to the Wana countries.

 Indian tea exports have dwindled to 172 million kgs in 2004 from 200-210 million kgs.

 The decision to set up an auction centre had been prompted by the Dubai government?s invitation to sell tea through the Dubai Tea Trading Centre (DTTC). 

 DTTC is being promoted by the Dubai Metals and Commodities Centre (DMCC) and the Dubai Ports Authority.

 DMCC had also said it was willing to structure the Dubai-authored tea initiative to meet the needs of the Indian tea industry.

 In fact, the industry had sent representatives from the auction house ? Contemporary Targett ? to carry out a feasibility study of the Dubai market.

 DEPB scheme

 While the industry?s move to increase exports to the Wana region through the proposed Dubai auction centre has suffered a setback, it has asked the UPA government to allow them to get the facilities under the duty entitlement passbook (DEPB) scheme on tea exports.

 The basic purpose of the DEPB scheme is to neutralise the incidence of various types of duties charged on the input material. 

 The neutralisation is provided by the grant of duty credit calculated on the basis of standard input-output norms. The calculation also takes into account the value addition achieved in export products.

 ?Our input cost is extremely high, which raises our cost of production. If the DEPB scheme is offered to us, it will come as a relief. We had recently met Union commerce secretary S. N. Menon, where we had put forward this proposal. He has assured us that the matter will be looked into,? said C. K. Dhanuka, chairman of the Indian Tea Association.

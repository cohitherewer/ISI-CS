 Kajaria to hike capacity 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 7: Kajaria Ceramics Limited (KCL) plans to invest Rs 240 crore in the next four years to double its production capacity. The investment will help achieve the targeted turnover of Rs 600 crore by March 2009.

 Chairman and managing director Ashok Kajaria said, ?We are expanding the capacity at our Sikandarabad unit from 5.5 million sq m to 9.7 million sq m per annum. The expansion will incur an expenditure of Rs 60 crore and will be completed by March 2005. This will take our total production capacity to 18 million sq m per annum.?

 The Rajasthan unit has an annual capacity of 8.3 million sq m.

 ?The expansion will give us an additional capacity to leverage market opportunities thrown up by the boom in the housing and infrastructure sector,? said Kajaria.

 The ceramic industry has been growing at 15 per cent for the last five years and is expected to maintain and exceed this growth rate for the next five years.

 ?KCL has not been growing as fast as the industry mainly because of the influx of small-scale players,? said Kajaria. ?However, with the industry now on a level-playing field, we expect to double our revenues in the next four to five years.?

 The ceramics industry is estimated at Rs 4000 crore.

 ?We are also the largest exporter of ceramic tiles from India,? added Kajaria. ?Of the total Rs 80 crore exported in 2003-04, our exports stood at Rs 21.6 crore.?

 KCL expects to register a turnover of Rs 300 crore for the current financial year against Rs 269.84 crore last year.

 For the nine-month period ended December 31, revenues increased by 13 per cent to Rs 209.73 crore against Rs 185.53 crore in the corresponding period last year.

 Kajaria said the company expected a profit of Rs 27 crore in the current fiscal, of which Rs 7 crore would be adjusted against deferred tax.

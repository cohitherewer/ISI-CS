 New Delhi, Nov. 9: GAIL (India) Ltd today signed a memorandum of agreement with Exmar Marine NV of Belgium for on-board liquefied natural gas regassification technology. India could use this technology to import natural gas from Myanmar to Haldia or Paradip. 

 Under the deal, GAIL will utilise Exmars logistics expertise to import LNG and jointly pursue transportation of compressed natural gas by ship. 

 GAIL chief Proshanto Banerjee and Exmar CEO Nicolas Saverys signed the agreement in the presence of petroleum minister, Mani Shankar Aiyar.

 Aiyar said the on-board regassification technology will bring down costs as it does away with the need to set up a regassification terminal at the port. This has opened up a new option for importing gas from Myanmar where ONGC and GAIL have a 30 per cent stake in a giant gas field and an exploration block adjoining it, he added. 

 While negotiations for laying a pipeline are on, transporting gas through the ship will be faster. The large-sized ship can be anchored next to a single-point mooring in the sea and the gas can be discharged to the shore. 

 Exmar has developed a new application ? LNGRV ? for transporting and regassifying LNG. It consists of a standard LNG carrier to transport the LNG. The vessel has been modified to be able to regassify the LNG on-board as well as discharge the gas in various modes.

 The technology is currently in operation at the worlds first offshore LNG terminal at the Gulf Gateway operated by Excelerate Energy.

 Under the agreement, GAIL and Exmar will evaluate the merits, including technical, operational and commercial aspects of transporting the LNG in the conventional way versus using the LNGRV technology.

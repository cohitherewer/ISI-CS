 Priority to farm growth

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Oct. 27: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today said the country must aim for a 4 per cent growth rate in agriculture in order to realise the overall economic growth rate of more than 8 per cent per annum.

 Inaugurating the national conference on Krishi Vigyan Kendras, Singh underlined the need to restructure and energise our agricultural extension system so that new technologies and farm management practices get transferred to our farming community.

 If one looks at the overall macro-economic scenario in the country, I see that the environment is quite favourable for accelerating the growth rate beyond 8 per cent.

 Indias economy is poised for a 7 per cent growth this fiscal and the economic environment is conducive for more than 8 per cent growth in the long term, he said. This is not impossible. We grew at almost 7 per cent last year, and this year, we expect the growth to be in excess of 7 per cent.

 However, this is being achieved on a farm growth of less than 2 per cent.

 In the first three years of the Tenth Five Year plan period, the average annual growth rate in agriculture has been just 1.5 per cent. We have made determined efforts to reverse this trend, he said. 

 He urged scientists to work on new technologies and best farm practices to usher in a second green revolution.

 Hyundai withdraws Swift brochure 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 23: Hyundai Motor India Limited has temporarily withdrawn its controversial advertising brochure called Xing ahead of the Swift.

 Maruti Udyog had served a legal notice to Hyundai last week which said the brochure was false, misleading and deceptive.

 We have given our response to Maruti, a Hyundai spokesperson said. However, he refused to reveal details. 

 Hyundai had responded to Marutis solicitor firm Amarchand Mangaldass notice. However, sources said Maruti is not satisfied and has decided to harden its stance in the absence of an apology.

 Marutis notice had demanded a public clarification from Hyundai along with a written undertaking within seven days of receipt that you will henceforth not disparage Marutis products in any manner whatsoever.

 Refusing to state whether Hyundai had apologised, a company spokesperson said, We did not make public the notice sent by Maruti and we do not intend to make our response public.

 On the other hand, a Maruti official said: Maruti has received the reply. We are studying the content for future course of action. 

 After sending a legal notice to Hyundai on June 16 with a seven-day deadline to apologise and withdraw the campaign, Maruti managing director Jagdish Khattar had said the company would take necessary action in case of non-compliance.

 The trouble between the two companies started after Maruti launched the 1.3-litre Swift in May with an introductory price tag of Rs 3.87 lakh.

 Spanner in Jessop plan

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 17: The financial restructuring of Jessop and Company today ran into a fresh hurdle with the Appellate Authority for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (AAIFR) directing maintenance of status quo.

 The AAIFR order was passed following an appeal by the Jessop staff association challenging two orders of the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) dated August 31 and October 6.

 When contacted, Jessop chairman Pawan Ruia said the company would challenge the order legally.

 The BIFR orders had allowed Jessop to reduce the share capital from Rs 95 crore to Rs 9.5 crore by reducing the face value of shares from Rs 10 to Re 1. It had also cleared the rights issue of Rs 52.04 crore and exempted the company from meeting the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) guidelines.

 Todays AAIFR order may delay Ruias plan ? who bought the company from the government in 2003 ? to take almost full control of Jessop through the rights issue that concluded on November 1. Earlier, AAIFR had stayed the Sebi exemption granted by BIFR. The Ruias had moved Calcutta High Court, which stayed the order.

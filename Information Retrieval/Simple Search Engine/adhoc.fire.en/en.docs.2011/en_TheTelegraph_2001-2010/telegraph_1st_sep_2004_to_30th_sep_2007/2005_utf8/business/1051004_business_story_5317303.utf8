 HSBC close to deal with Iraqi bank

 The iraq plan

 Kuwait, Oct. 3 (Reuters): HSBC Holdings Plc said on Sunday it was very close to securing a deal to buy a 70 per cent stake in Iraqs Dar Es Salaam Investment Bank in a bid to expand into Iraq as it rebuilds after war.

 HSBC has been in talks with Dar Es Salaam since at least July 2004 when the Iraqi central bank said it had received a request to approve HSBCs purchase of a 51 per cent stake from the Khudairy family.

 We are very close to concluding an agreement, David Hodgkinson, CEO of HSBC Bank Middle East, told a news conference in Kuwait, where the London-based bank established a presence on Sunday for the first time since 1971.

 Hodgkinson later said HSBC was looking to buy 70 per cent, not just the 51 per cent previously mentioned.

 Foreign banks were banned from Iraq throughout 35 years of Baathist rule. Saddam Hussein allowed private Iraqi banks to operate in the 1990s, but the banking system was badly affected by a crippling economic embargo and heavy regulation.

 The now disbanded US-led occupation authority gave HSBC, Standard Chartered Plc and the National Bank of Kuwait permission last year to open in Iraq.

 But violence has set back plans to open branches, and HSBC does not yet have operations in Iraq.

 Although it is billed as an investment bank, Dar Es Salaam is a commercial lender with personal banking operations. Hodgkinson said the bank had 14 branches in Iraq.

 I think because the banking system in Iraq is still in its fairly early stages of development it will be a question of putting in place fundamental services, Hodgkinson said.

 But we are looking to computerise, to have ATMs and to offer cross-country payments and other services. And they do have a branch network. 

 Hodgkinson opened an HSBC branch in Kuwait, which relaxed licensing rules for foreign banks in 2004 to open up the sector to competition. HSBC had left the country in 1971 after all foreign bank operations were nationalised.

 It fills an obvious network gap for us in West Asia and allows us to forge new direct relationships with major institutions in Kuwait, Hodgkinson said in a statement.

 HSBC is the second foreign bank to set up shop in Kuwait after Frances BNP Paribas. Citibank and National Bank of Abu Dhabi also have approvals.

 We are pretty optimistic about the Gulf region; obviously its helped by high oil, gas and petrochemical prices, but its not solely driven by that, Hodgkinson said.

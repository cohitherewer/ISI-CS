 Bangalore airport pacts signed

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, Jan. 20: The Karnataka government and Siemens-led consortium signed two agreements today, overcoming the last hurdles before the financial closure of the Rs 1,335-crore greenfield international airport near Devanahalli, about 35 kms from Bangalore.

 The agreements ? one for long-term lease of 4000 acres of land for the project and the second for a loan of Rs 350 crore ? were the result of several months of discussions between officials of the state government and Bangalore International Airport Ltd (BIAL).

 ?We expect to achieve the financial closure by February-end to take up the construction work of the airport from March. The airport is expected to be ready for commercial operations in 33 months or by 2007,? BIAL CEO Albert Bruner said after agreements were signed in the presence of chief minister Dharam Singh and several senior ministers.

 The first agreement was signed by Vinay Kumar, principal secretary of the infrastructure development department, and BIALs directors A. Ramakrishna and Herbert Meier. The land lease agreement was signed by I. M. Vittal Murthy, managing director, Karnataka State Industrial and Investment Development Corporation (KSIIDC), and Ramakrishna and Meier.

 The Siemens-led consortium, under the aegis of BIAL, consists of Unique Zurich Airport and Larson amp; Toubro (L amp;T). KSIIDC and the Airports Authority of India (AAI) are partners in the project.

 The state cabinet cleared the project on December 11, 2004.

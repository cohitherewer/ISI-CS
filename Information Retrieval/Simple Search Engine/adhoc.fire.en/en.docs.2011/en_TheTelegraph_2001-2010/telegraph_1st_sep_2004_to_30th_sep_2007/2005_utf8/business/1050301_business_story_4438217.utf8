Small investors need to grow up

Super Saver / Ranjeet S. Mudholkar

The Union Budget 2005 will compel and induce small 

investors to move out of his comfort zone and face up to the realities of investing. 

Till now, sections such as section 88 of the Income Tax Act provided investors 

with an avenue to invest in government-guaranteed securities which provided rates 

of returns above market rates with attractive tax benefits.

Form April 1, 2006, section 88 benefits have been 

withdrawn. This is proposed to be replaced by a new section wherein the taxable 

income can be reduced by up to Rs 1 lakh in case of certain investments.

While the exact nuances of this section have yet to 

be specified, it is clear that from now on risk and return will be directly correlated. 

This development provides a fillip to the financial planning profession.

These changes will induce investors to move away from 

investments in government and small savings schemes which were made purely on 

tax-saving and security considerations. 

However, there is a danger that people may invest 

in certain instruments without realising the long-term implications. It is here 

that financial planning professionals can step in and reach out to the investing 

populace and advise them on their ?life goals?.

Overall, this budget has been largely market neutral. 

There have been no changes on the dividend and capital gains front. However, the 

direct tax changes, which have been proposed, will act as the most important catalyst 

in altering investor preference.

All investment opportunities, including long-term 

and short-term like public provident fund, National Savings Certificate, mutual 

funds, will constitute as investments.

However, a clarification on the definition of investments 

need to be made by the appropriate authorities, especially keeping in view the 

fact that there could be various avenues deemed as investment that gives returns 

like even savings bank account, bank fixed deposits and real estate. The suitable 

clarification would impact all the investors.

The whole budget is indeed focussed towards finance 

minister?s earlier stance of attempting to transform India from a nation of savers 

to a nation of investors.

 Calcutta, Aug. 10: The Centre has decided to set up a food park in Bengal.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today said the Union ministry of food processing could invest around Rs 100 crore in the park.

 Minister of food processing Subodh Kant Sahay told me that the Centre has selected Dankuni near Calcutta for a food park, he said.

 The Centre will set up four to five such parks across the country.

 They will be developed on a public-private partnership basis. A special purpose vehicle could be set up for the projects. 

 A detailed policy on the food park scheme will soon be circulated by the ministry.

 At present, the Centre provides assistance of up to Rs 4 crore or 25 per cent of a project cost, whichever is less, for food parks.

 Under this scheme, three parks are coming up in Bengal; at Siliguri, Haldia and Malda.

 Apart from these, at least four more food parks are coming up in the state. One of them will be developed with French collaboration.

 This a turning point in the states history. We have to move to agri-business from agriculture, Bhattacharjee said at a CII seminar ? Agro East 2005 ? today.

 Bengal is the largest producer of rice and vegetables in the country.

 However, around 8-10 per cent of the produce gets wasted in the field itself due to lack of proper marketing network. There are inadequate cold storage facilities in the state.

 The chief minister said the food parks will develop the critical infrastructure ? cold chain ? in the state.

 He called for local private participation in the food processing sector.

 Bengals vegetable production stands at 112 lakh tonnes, while that of rice is 158 lakh tonnes.

 Bhattacharjee also said scientist M.S. Swaminathan has decided to set up a rice park in Bengal.

 I have asked my colleague to find a plot for the park. It will work on improving rice seeds, he said.

 Frito Lay plans

 Frito-Lay India, a PepsiCo subsidiary, plans to ramp up its capacity at its Bengal unit. Managing director Manu Anand, who attended the seminar, said Frito-Lay will invest Rs 35 crore to increase the capacity to 20,000 tonnes from 15,000 tonnes. 

 It might invest another Rs 50 crore to raise the capacity further to 25,000 tonnes. 

 Frito-Lay, with brands like Lays and Kurkure, has over 40 per cent share in the salted branded snack market.

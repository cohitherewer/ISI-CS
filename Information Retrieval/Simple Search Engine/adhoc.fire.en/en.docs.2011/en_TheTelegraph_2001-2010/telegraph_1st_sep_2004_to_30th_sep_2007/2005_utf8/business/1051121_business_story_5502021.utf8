 FDI low in handset firms

 Childs play

 Calcutta, Nov. 20: Notwithstanding the worlds leading mobile handset makers such as Nokia, LG and Elcoteq lining up an estimated $800-million investment to set up their manufacturing facilities in India next year, the country is lagging far behind China and Korea to become a global hub for handset manufacturing.

 India has miles to go before it can threaten the position of entrenched players like China and Korea in the mobile handset manufacturing space despite being the second fastest growing telecom market in the world, said Pankaj Mohindroo, president, Indian Cellular Association. Indias annual handset market, estimated at Rs 12,000 crore, is currently around 30 million units. It is expected to go up to 40 million next year, Mohindroo added. 

 According to a study by KPMG, a growing demand for mobile phones and the advantage of low-cost labour are not sufficient to make India the handset manufacturing hub of the world. Meanwhile, Nokia, LG and Elcoteq have unveiled plans to set their manufacturing facilities in the country.

 The study points that a combination of critical factors has helped countries like Taiwan, China, Finland and Korea emerge as leaders in handset manufacturing. These include local demand, existing electronics manufacturing base, government policies and incentives, investment in R amp;D, product leadership and labour arbitrage.

 The cost of infrastructure services is between 50 and 100 per cent higher in India than in China. While freight charges comprise 11 per cent of the total cost here, it is only 6 per cent in other countries. Industrial power is 1.5-2.5 times costlier than in China. Availability of power is another issue. Besides, there are procedural delays and archaic labour regulations posing hurdles to manufacturing in India, said Mohindroo.

 Besides setting up the right kind of infrastructure, it is necessary to simultaneously develop a component industry. The need is evident from the fact that of the $1-trillion electronic manufacturing industry worldwide, India has a meagre share of $10 billion compared with Chinas $250 billion, he said. 

 Though India compares favourably in terms of wage costs, the conversion costs (wages, utilities, depreciation and interest costs) are typically between 2 and 3 per cent for handset manufacturing.

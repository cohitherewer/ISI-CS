 Provogue sews up expansion 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 6: Provogue India is exploring the possibilities of an overseas presence, even as it has decided to focus on the domestic market.

 Provogue officials said initially, the company might look at West Asia and South Asia before venturing to other nations. However, these expansion plans will bear fruit only after it consolidates its position in the domestic market. 

 The company will realise its plans by increasing its manufacturing facilities and distribution reach apart from offering a wide range of merchandise. To increase the branch network, Provogue plans to open 40 new small studios (Provogue Studios) and 21 larger format stories (Provogue Megastores) in two years. 

 While the small studios will have an average area of 1100 sq feet, the megastores will have an average area of 5000 sq feet. According to the companys red herring prospectus, the total capital expenditure for setting up the chain is put at over Rs 28 crore. At present, Provogue has 41 branded stores in 19 cities. Its products are also delivered through national chain stores and multi-brand outlets.

 The company plans to expand its manufacturing capacity to 3000 shirts per day. It is also setting up a trouser unit with a capacity to make 1000 pieces per day. So far it has been outsourcing trousers sold through its outlets.

 Provogue India managing director Nikhil Chaturvedi said the company intends to foray into the womens wear, childrens wear, shoes, innerwear and denim segments. At present, its product portfolio consists of products for men like shirts, trousers, T Shirts, sweaters, shorts and suits. The company targets consumers in the age group of 22 to 40 years.

 The company initially sold mens shirts and trousers through multi-brand outlets and national chain stores.

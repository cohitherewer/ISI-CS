 Forex swings prompt Patni margin review

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Nov. 23: Patni Computer Systems, which is in the process of getting listed on a US stock exchange, has lowered its operating margin forecast for the year to 15.75-16.25 per cent from 16-16.50 per cent earlier. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and an increase in subcontractor expenses are the reasons for this revision, the company said.

 While Patni maintained its revenue forecast for 2005 at $448-450 million, it revised the operating margin expectations downward due to fluctuations in the foreign exchange rates and an increase in subcontractor expenses. The company also updated its net income guidance for the year to $63-64 million.

 The computer manufacturer made this disclosure when it filed a registration statement (Form F-1) with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its Initial Public Offering (IPO) of 6,875,000 American Depository Shares (ADS). 

 Each ADS represents two equity shares with a face value of Rs 2 each. The proposed ADS issue is comprised of 5.125 million primary ADS and 1.75 million secondary ADS. It also has an additional 1.03125 million in primary ADS under the green shoe option given to the underwriters.

 The company is planning to use the proceeds of the ADS issue in funding the construction and development of new infrastructure facilities in India. Patni is in the midst of an expansion plan that involves building two new knowledge parks in Navi Mumbai and Chennai over the next three years, new and expanded facilities in Bangalore and Hyderabad and improved facilities at other locations in the country. The expenditures for these facilities are estimated at $300 million. 

 The first phase of the Navi Mumbai facility is likely to be completed by October 2006 and will accommodate around 5,000 people. The initial phase of the Chennai facility will be completed by December 2006 and it will house in close to 1,200 people.

 In the registration statement, Patni said it derived a significant portion of revenues from a limited number of clients in a few select industries. For instance, in 2003 and 2004, its largest client, General Electric, accounted for 41.2 per cent and 31.7 per cent of revenues, while its second largest client, State Farm Insurance, accounted for 17.4 per cent and 14.9 per cent of the revenues.

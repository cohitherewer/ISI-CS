 Teva to buy rival drug firm for $7.5 

 bn

 ANDREW ROSS SORKIN AND BARRY MEIER 

 New York, July 26: Teva 

 Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd is near a deal to acquire 

 the Ivax Corp for about $7.5 billion in cash and stock, 

 executives involved in the negotiations said. 

 The deal would merge two of the 

 worlds biggest generic drug makers. Under the terms 

 of the deal, Teva will pay $26 a share for Ivax, or a 14 

 per cent premium over Fridays closing stock price 

 of $22.88, the executives said. That payment will be split 

 evenly between Teva stock and cash, and Teva will also assume 

 about $1 billion in Ivax debt. 

 Teva, the bigger of the two drug 

 makers, is based in Israel and had sales last year of $4.8 

 billion, 91 per cent of which came from the US and Europe. 

 Ivax, based in Miami, had revenues in 2004 of $1.84 billion. 

 Representatives of Ivax could not be reached for comment.

 The deal is one of several recently 

 involving producers of generic drugs. In February, Novartis, 

 the maker of branded prescription drugs based in Switzerland, 

 announced a plan to buy Hexal of Germany and its affiliate 

 Eon Labs of New York for $8.4 billion in cash, creating 

 the worlds biggest generic drug maker.

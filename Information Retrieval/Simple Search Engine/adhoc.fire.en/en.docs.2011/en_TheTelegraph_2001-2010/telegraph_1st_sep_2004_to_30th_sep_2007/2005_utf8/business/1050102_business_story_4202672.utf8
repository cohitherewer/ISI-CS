 Citigroup emerges top underwriter 

 New York, Jan. 1 (Reuters): Citigroup Inc. was in 2004 Wall Streets busiest stock and bond underwriter for the fifth year in a row, amid the welcome resurgence in investor demand for equities and surprisingly strong sentiment for bonds.

 Data released on Friday by Thomson Financial also show that reported underwriting fees rose 7 percent, fuelled by growth in high-fee stock and initial public offerings as US stocks posted a second year of double-digit percentage gains.

 ?Wall Street continued to meet the almost insatiable demand for capital,? said Richard Peterson, Thomsons chief market strategist.

 ?The 2004 year started with a lot of anxiety because of the (U.S.) elections and foreign policy, but equity prices ended up,? he said. 

 ?If inflation remains in check and earnings multiples improve, you might see higher equity prices, spurring more issuance, IPOs and perhaps even mergers. The wild cards are terrorism and oil prices. quot;

 Worldwide stock and bond underwriting totalled $5.69 trillion, up 6 per cent from a year earlier, and reported fees totalled $15.4 billion, Thomson data show.

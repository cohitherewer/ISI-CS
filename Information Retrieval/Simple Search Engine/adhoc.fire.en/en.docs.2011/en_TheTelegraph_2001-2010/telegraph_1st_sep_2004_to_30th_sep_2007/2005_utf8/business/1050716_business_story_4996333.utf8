 Dabhol power pact soon

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Bhardwaj: Upbeat

 New Delhi, July 15: The government has directed the National Thermal Power Corporation, Gail and IDBI-led consortium of Indian lenders to draw up a shareholders pact and a power purchase agreement within a week so that the 2184-mw Dabhol power plant can start generation by July next year.

 All cases related to the project have been settled and the plant will begin generation within a year, Union law and justice minister H.R. Bhardwaj told reporters here today. 

 Power secretary R.V. Shahi said, We have asked NTPC, Gail and financial institutions to finalise the shareholders agreement and the power purchase agreement within a week.

 MSEB will be the sole buyer of the power generated from the plant. The power would be priced at Rs 2.30 per unit, half of which is the cost of the fuel.

 Shahi said liquefied natural gas (LNG) for the plant has not been arranged as yet, but talks are going on. Gail has been entrusted with the task of importing the LNG.

 The empowered group of ministers, headed by defence minister Pranab Mukherjee, has prepared a cabinet note on the settlement, said power minister P.M. Sayeed. 

 The note is likely to be forwarded for cabinet approval after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh returns from the US.

 The Dabhol plant would be run by a special purpose vehicle (SPV) floated by the NTPC, Gail and domestic lenders to the project.

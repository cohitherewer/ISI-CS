 Dena first to open no-frills account 

 Mumbai, Nov. 17 (PTI): State-owned Dena Bank today announced a scheme where customers can open a savings bank account with an initial balance of Rs 10.

 The launch of Dena Alpa Bachat Khata hopes to foster the banking habit among individuals, chairman and managing director M.V. Nair said.

 Under the scheme, any individual could open the account with the bank with an initial minimum balance of Rs 10 and the account can be continued with zero balance, he added.

 The RBI, in its mid-term review, had urged banks to introduce no-frills accounts where the minimum balance would be either zero or very low to increase banking activities among the masses. 

 Dena Bank has almost 60 per cent of its branches in rural and semi-urban areas. Nair said the bank wants people with accumulated and unutilised cash to taking banking seriously. There is huge untapped opportunity for banks to plug in, he added.

 FM ready for inflation battle

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 9: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today said the government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) would take necessary steps to contain inflation.

 The ministers statement was an attempt to allay fears that the increased diesel and petrol prices will push up the inflation rate. The prices of vegetables, including onions, have also started rising.

 According to official figures released today, the rate of inflation fell marginally to 3.01 per cent in the week ended August 27 from 3.08 per cent a week ago. However, the prices of food items, aviation fuel and manufactured goods went up during this period. The rate of inflation was over 8 per cent during the same period last year. 

 The hike in petrol price by Rs 3 a litre and that of diesel by Rs 2 a litre was effective from September 6 and will be felt only after 2-3 weeks.

 The rate of inflation has been falling in the last few months mainly due to prudent management of money supply by the Reserve Bank and the reduction in prices of essential commodities.

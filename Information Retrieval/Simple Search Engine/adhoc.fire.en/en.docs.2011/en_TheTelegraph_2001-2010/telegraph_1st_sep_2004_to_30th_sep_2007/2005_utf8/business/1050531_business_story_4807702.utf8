 Huge penalty shadow on Tata Tele

 WiLL they, wont they?

 New Delhi, May 30: Tata Teleservices may have to pay Rs 350 crore as penalty to Bharat Sanchar Nigam for connecting calls to Walky, its limited mobile brand.

 Delhi High Court has asked Tata Teleservices to pay up within four weeks 50 per cent of the Rs 95-lakh claimed by BSNL as interconnectivity charges on Walky. The court said the same principle would apply to other bills sent by BSNL.

 The interim order settles a petition filed by Tata Teleservices (TTSL) seeking to restrain BSNL from taking coercive action against it. 

 BSNL had claimed a loss of more than Rs 95 lakh in interconnection charges to the Tatas, who will move the Telecom Dispute Settlement and Appellate Tribunal during the next few days challenging the Delhi High Court directive.

 We are working on the wrong presentation of interconnection charges by Tata Teleservices in all circles. The loss to us could be as big as Rs 250-350 crore. The company has just started assessing the losses and we have asked for information from all circles and secondary switching areas, BSNL officials said.

 In the petition, Tata Teleservices had contended that BSNLs May 12 demand for charges in the Chennai circle was illegal. 

 In the notice, BSNL had said that in case of non-payment by May 20, the Rs 5-crore bank guarantee for the circle would be encashed and the points of interconnection snapped on June 13. It has also warned of additional interestcharges.

 The public sector giant has unilaterally reclassified the fixed wireless phones as wireless-in-local-loop mobility. It is now demanding increased interconnection usage and access deficit charges, Tata Teleservices said in its suit.

 The company contended that the demand for higher charges was raised by BSNL after it altered the interconnect user and access deficit charges without legal sanction.

 Calcutta, Jan. 4: Allahabad Bank today received shareholders? approval to raise fresh funds for future expansion and consolidation through another public issue of Rs 100 crore.

 ?We will issue 10 crore equity 

 shares with an aggregate value of Rs 100 crore at a premium 

 to be decided within the next 20 days,? Allahabad Bank chairman 

 and managing director O. N. Singh said.

 The size, structure and timing of the second public issue through the book building process will be decided in consultation with lead managers and other advisers.

 Singh added that after the completion of the offer, the issued capital of the bank would be raised to Rs 446.70 crore and the government?s stake will come down to 55.23 per cent from the existing 71.16 per cent.

 ?The bank has opted for book building instead of the fixed price route for a better price discovery as well as greater participation from the qualified institutional buyers, institutions, existing shareholders, banks, FII?s and employees,? he said.

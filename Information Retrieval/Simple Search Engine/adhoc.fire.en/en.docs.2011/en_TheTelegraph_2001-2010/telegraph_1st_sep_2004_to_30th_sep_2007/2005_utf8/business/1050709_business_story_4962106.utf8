 Calcutta, July 8: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has allowed HDFC Bank to invest 8 per cent of its net advances in the stock market against the existing cap of 5 per cent for banks.

 HDFC Banks capital market exposure has been highly satisfactory and with such a track record the bank had requested the RBI for a special dispensation by raising the cap, chairman Jagdish Capoor said on the sidelines of the Banking Conclave organised by Ficci (eastern region).

 HDFC Bank is the largest cash settlement bank for the Bombay Stock Exchange, National Stock Exchange and other regional bourses.

 Our share in daily cash settlement ranges from 35 per cent to 55 per cent. Most large brokerages and custodians settle their payments to the clearing house of the exchanges through us. With this business as a base, we have been able to extend working capital finance to the brokerage houses with the least amount of risk, the chairman said.

 The bank is also considering floating a non-banking finance company (NBFC). This will enable the new generation private bank to step up its corporate lending at a time when the credit offtake of the banking industry has been growing significantly.

 Capoor said, We are looking at floating our own NBFC for exclusive fund-based activity. The proposal has not yet been placed before the board. Therefore, I cannot say when it is going to happen.

 At present, banks cannot lend more than 15 per cent of their net worth to an individual borrower and 40 per cent to a corporate group under the RBI exposure norms.

 Capoor said, An NBFC will enable us to broadbase our lending activity. It will also open up a lot of other opportunities. 

 HDFC Bank will be among the first private sector banks to float an NBFC arm.

 The chairman accepted the inability to reach the agricultural lending target as set out by the government.

 Credit card business

 HDFC Bank has sold more than 1.5 million credit cards and the net receivables is more than Rs 800 crore. In the next few months, the bank expects to cross the 2-million-card mark and Rs 1000 crore receivables.

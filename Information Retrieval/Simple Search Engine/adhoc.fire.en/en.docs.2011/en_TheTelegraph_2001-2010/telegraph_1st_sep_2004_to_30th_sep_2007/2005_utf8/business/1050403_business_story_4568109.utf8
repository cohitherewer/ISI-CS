 Petro price hike ruled out for now

 Chennai, April 2: Prices of petrol, diesel and LPG are unlikely to rise for the time being, petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar said today, even as crude rates surged to a record of $58 a barrel on Friday. 

 Petrol prices had risen in other countries, while they had remained unchanged over the last six months in India. ?You can compare it with Italy, France, Japan and Norway. The prices there are higher,? he said. In the US, rates are low because there is substantial production, he said. 

 US light crude settled up $1.87 to $57.27 after peaking at $57.70 a barrel, breaking the previous record of $57.60 hit on March 17. 

 Goldman Sachs said in a report that the oil markets may have entered a ?super-spike? period, which could drive prices toward $105.

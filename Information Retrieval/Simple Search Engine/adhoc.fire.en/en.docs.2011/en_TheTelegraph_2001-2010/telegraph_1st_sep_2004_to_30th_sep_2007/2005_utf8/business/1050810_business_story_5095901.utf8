 NTPC charges up to restart Dabhol 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Aug. 9: The National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) today said that the Dabhol power project would commence generation within one year of its takeover by a joint venture between the corporation and Gail (India). 

 The price of power from the plant has been fixed at Rs 2.30 per unit. The tariff includes a fixed charge of Rs 1.10 and fuel costs.

 C.P. Jain, chairman of the public sector power producer, said that the inspection of the plant, which has been lying idle for five years now, has been completed and the joint venture would need one year from the takeover day to start power generation.

 We would be able to start the first phase within one year from the date of its (Dabhol project) hand over to the newly formed joint venture ? between NTPC and Gail, he said, while maintaining that the Dabhol power project is a viable proposition.

 The NTPC chief said that the corporation was not interested in the project at one point of time as it was in the midst of a dispute and the corporations participation would have a financial impact. However, it was then willing to give technical support to anybody willing to restart the beleaguered plant. 

 However, the power project became viable after the domestic lenders (financial institutions) had entered into a settlement with external agencies Bechtel and GE, Jain pointed out. The 2,184-mw, gas-based plant will now be run by a special purpose vehicle, called Ratnagiri Gas and Power Pvt Ltd, which has been floated by NTPC, Gail and IDBI-led lenders consortium.

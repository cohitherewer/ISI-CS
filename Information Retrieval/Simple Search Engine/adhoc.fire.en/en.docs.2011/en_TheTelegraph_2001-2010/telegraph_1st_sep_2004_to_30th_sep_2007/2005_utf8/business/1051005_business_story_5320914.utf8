The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Land sale to revive Bengal PSU duo

 S.P.S PANNU 

 New Delhi, Oct. 4: The ministry of heavy industries and public enterprises has decided to allow Calcutta-based Andrew Yule amp; Co and Braithwaite amp; Co to sell their surplus land for raising funds to nurse themselves back to health. 

 Heavy industries minister Santosh Mohan Dev told The Telegraph that the recommendation allowing the two public sector companies sell their excess real estate has been sent to the board for reconstruction of public sector enterprises.

 The ministry is of the view that the two loss-making firms be allowed to sell a portion of their prime real estate on the same lines as National Textile Corporations (NTC) surplus land was sold in Mumbai. The sale proceeds, however, will have to be ploughed back to the same company. 

 The minister said the sale would be conducted in a transparent manner through open auction. Representatives from banks and the state government will also be involved in the process. 

 By selling just five mills in Mumbai, NTC has raked in more than Rs 2,000 crore of the Rs 4,697 crore required to revive the company. 

 In July, a part of the land owned by Hindustan Machine Tools in Bangalore was also sold for raising funds for the company.

 The highest bid had come from a private player. However, the prospective buyer was not able to raise the funds. So, the land was sold to the government at the market price.

 Andrew Yule shells out over Rs 500 crore every year as salaries and wages to its staff and has an interest liability in excess of Rs 200 crore per annum. Cash-rich ONGC is looking at taking over Andrew Yules subsidiary, Tide Water Oil, which will also help pump in more money into the ailing company. The government plans to sell the electrical equipment business of Andrew Yule as well. 

 Dev said his ministry is in touch with the railway ministry to get more orders for Braithwaite and Burn Standard. He said there are adequate orders to keep these companies running for six months and more orders will follow. Railway minister Lalu Prasad Yadav has assured me that these companies will not suffer due to a lack of orders.

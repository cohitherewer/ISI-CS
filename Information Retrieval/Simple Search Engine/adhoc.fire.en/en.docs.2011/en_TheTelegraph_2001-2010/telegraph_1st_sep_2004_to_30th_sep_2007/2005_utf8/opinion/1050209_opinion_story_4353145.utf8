 STAIN OF BLOOD

One disadvantage of having a big mouth is that there 

is always the danger of putting ones foot into it. Mr Narendra Modi, the 

chief minister of Gujarat, is prone to do this. He has taken it upon himself to 

attack Pakistan because the Pakistan Cricket Board has decided that it will not 

permit its players to play in a test match in Ahmedabad. The PCB said that the 

security team that had recently visited India had advised against playing in Ahmedabad. 

What Mr Modi does not realize is that his anti-Pakistan venom only adds to the 

security fears of the PCB. The security considerations relate, of course, to the 

atmosphere of hatred towards Muslims that Mr Modi has successfully produced in 

Gujarat. He has not uttered a single word of regret for the pogrom that was carried 

out in the state under his aegis. Mr Modis lack of moderation and his sense 

of the absurd are evident from his comment that the soil of Gujarat is ready 

and prepared to beat Pakistan. Mr Modi is perhaps the only man in the world 

who believes that the soil of Gujarat will be playing cricket against Pakistan 

if a match is played in Ahmedabad. Fanaticism has resulted in the evaporation 

of common sense.

Mr Modi is very eager to preserve Gujarat?s pride, 

and he interprets the PCB?s refusal as an insult not only to Gujarat but also 

to India. It would behove him to remember that if anything has diminished the 

position of Gujarat in the eyes of the world, it is the killing of Muslims in 

2002 and the prevailing ambience of fear and intimidation in which the Muslims 

of the state continue to live. Mr Modi?s brazenness has further lowered the image 

of Gujarat. It is too much to expect that Mr Modi will take into account the fact 

that the ongoing dialogue between India and Pakistan is now crucially poised, 

and that his anti-Pakistan tirades can only harm the progress of that dialogue. 

Or maybe that is precisely what he wants. By his various pronouncements, his refusal 

to take steps to stop the pogrom and by his lack of shame, Mr Modi has tainted 

the tradition of tolerance which is the hallmark of Indian culture and civilization. 

He is now proceeding to becoming an embarrassment to Indian foreign policy and 

the world of cricket. The fact that Mr Modi gets away with all this is proof of 

the vitality of democracy in India.

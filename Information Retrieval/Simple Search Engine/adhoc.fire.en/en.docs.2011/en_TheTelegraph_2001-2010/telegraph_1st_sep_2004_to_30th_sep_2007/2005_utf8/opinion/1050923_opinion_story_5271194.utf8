 THE ONE WHO GOT AWAY

 The Boy Who Loved Anne Frank 

 By Ellen Feldman, Picador, ? 12.99

 It was a piece of misinformation that led to the writing of this book. On a tour of Anne Frank House, Ellen Feldman was told by a guide that the fate of all the inhabitants of the Secret Annexe was known, but not that of Peter Van Pels. ?If this young man did not die with the others, I speculated, what might he have gone on to?? Early into her research, however, Feldman discovered that the guide had been wrong, and that Peter had died in the Mathausen concentration camp on May 15, 1945. But what?s an inconvenient fact on the high road to a good yarn? 

 Thus we have here a novel about a Holocaust survivor who makes it big in America, and woven into it is the history of the publication and reception of The Diary of Anne Frank. 

 Had he lived, Peter could well have lived the life Feldman imagines for him. After all, many of the German Jews who lived to see the end of World War II, emigrated to America, where even ?uniforms were innocent as children?s clothing?. And like many of these ?migr?s, Peter too flourished, fashioning his new life in line with his dreams. Starting out as a waiter, Peter rose to become a successful businessman, living the Great American Dream with his wife and two children in their two-storeyed house, spacious, well-appointed, its refrigerator stocked with food and almost nothing to remind him of the privations of the Secret Annexe on Prinsengracht 263. 

 Superficially, all that remained to connect him to his past was the number branded on the inside of his arm by the Germans when they carted him away to Auschwitz. Just as he?d promised Anne, Peter had told no one in America that he was a Jew. His wife, a Jewess herself ironically, too did not know (after all even gentiles were circumcized). At the level of the subconscious, it was a different matter. There were the memories, of course, and the extraordinary violence of his imagination as well as the curious habit of driving with one foot on the accelerator and one on the brake (as if he wanted to move fast and control his speed at the same time) and his stashing of money into a secret safe in his house ? just in case.

 Peter?s precarious mental balance is rendered even more fragile with the publication of the The Diary in 1952. In fact, Anne?s face on the cover leads to a temporary loss of speech. He recovers, but it?s to be only a brief respite. For Anne?s testimony of the quotidian horrors of the Nazi regime, written with all the sparkling impetuosity of an adolescent just awakening to life, had brought home to Americans the scale of the tragedy that befell her and six million of her kind. And Americans embraced her with all the fervent adulation that they reserve for rock stars. The book was followed by a play and then a movie and Peter found that it was his unique fate to have the world form its idea of himself and his family by the less-than-flattering testimony of a dead 15-year-old. Ironically, for Feldman, and also for the readers she had in mind when she wrote this book, it is the accident of Peter?s incipient romance with Anne that gives his life distinction, no matter that his life had been full of the same horrors as Anne?s.

 It is a poignant situation, one with much potential for tragedy. But Feldman?s Peter lives happily ever after. Even as dark memories threaten to tip him over, he is saved ? by his love for his wife and by religion. When we see him last, Peter is an old man, at peace with his memories and The Diary, ridiculously flailing at a German couple posing next to Anne?s statue, ?My God have they no memory??

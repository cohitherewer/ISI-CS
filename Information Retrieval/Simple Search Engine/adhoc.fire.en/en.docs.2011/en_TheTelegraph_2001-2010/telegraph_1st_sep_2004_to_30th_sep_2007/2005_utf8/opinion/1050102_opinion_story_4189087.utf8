 Letters to Editor

 Permanent help

 Sir ? As usual, reason defies the West Bengal government. Which is why Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has so happily bid goodbye to employment on contract and given more ammunition to the trade unions to hold the government to ransom (?CM dumps contract jobs?, Dec 30). But why the sudden change of heart? It is unlikely that the coffers are sounding less empty. Is it then because the government now finds its contractual employees less trustworthy than those who do its bidding in exchange for a permanent pay?

 Yours faithfully,

S. Mahato, Calcutta

 Breathing fire

 Sir ? The virtual ban on Behzti following the ugly incidents at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre is shocking. The narrow-mindedness of the Sikh community is appalling, and I feel vulnerable as an Indian for I may be mistaken to possess the same intolerance and disrespect for law. One always believed that it was in India alone that artistic freedom could be threatened. Remember the controversy over Fire, which was considered unacceptable to the fragile Indian public morality and decency. I distinctly remember the violent protests, the threat to the film-maker and the eventual censoring of the film. And all because it explored the un-admitted reality of lesbianism. Something horribly similar has happened to Behzti. 

 But it is the youth who should be replacing what is outdated and redundant in modern ideas to usher in a more tolerant, prosperous and acceptable society. If they are not allowed to do so, will there be any way to prevent them from succumbing to the sedate luxury of indifference and communalism or, as some would like to put it, the ?capricious? foreign culture? 

Yours faithfully, 

Sanjay Banerjee, Glasgow, UK 

 Sir ? Religion is a matter of personal faith. If someone irresponsibly tries to deride this faith, be it through art or literature or theatre, the anger that would follow would be most natural. Salman Rushdie, Taslima Nasreen and now, Gurpreet Kaur Bhatti, have tried to undermine religion and therefore they deserve the censure, although perhaps not the fatwas. Bhatti has herself invited the controversy. The portrayal of sexual abuse and homosexuality is more of a demonstration than a realistic picture of the Sikh society.

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

 Behind the pout

 Sir ? In the death of P.V. Narasimha Rao, the country has lost a multi-dimensional personality who alone could be entrusted with the charge of the government during a political vacuum. His efficient running of a minority government for a complete 5-year term without any alliance has been unique in post-independent Indian politics. His art of utilizing the opposition in national interest cannot be forgotten when he allowed Atal Bihari Vajpayee to head the Indian delegation to the crucial Geneva meet. Vajpayee considered Rao to be his political ideal, and rightly so. 

 Yours faithfully,

S.Chandra Agrawal, Dariba

 Sir ? The legacy of P.V. Narasimha Rao would not be the demolition of the Babri Masjid or the charges of corruption. He will be remembered as the Deng Xiaoping of India ? the prime minister under whom India opened up to the world and discarded some of its age old socialist baggage. The appointment of Manmohan Singh as the finance minister and more important, sticking by him during the balance of payment crisis, speak volumes of his political insight. 

Yours faithfully, 

A. Mukherjee, Coventry, UK

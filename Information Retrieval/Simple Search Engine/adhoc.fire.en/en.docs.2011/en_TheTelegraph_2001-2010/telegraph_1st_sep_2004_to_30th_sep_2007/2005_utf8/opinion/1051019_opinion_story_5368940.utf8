 BOARD GAME

 Reports indicate that the ministry of company affairs is likely to agree with the J.J. Irani committee?s view that at least a third of the board of directors of a public company should be made up of independent directors. That view has been the focus of much controversy, primarily because it is seen to be a dilution of clause 49 of the listing agreement, which stipulates that at least half the board should consist of independent directors when a companys chairman is also the chief executive officer. Understandably, corporate India is concerned about the impact of this requirement, because the Irani committee had also recommended that the number of directorships that an individual may hold should be restricted to a maximum of 15. Experts say that at least 25,000 independent directors will be required to fill these positions, and it will be very difficult to get qualified people. With less than three months left for the implementation of the new rule, corporates are worried. Furthermore, the ministry?s stand that the nominees of banks and financial institutions should not be treated as independent directors has also been a blow, with some public sector companies pointing out that they could even be delisted, because most of the directors on their boards are government nominees. 

 There is little doubt that there is a need for independent directors who would act as watchdogs of shareholders? interests. Ever since companies like Enron and WorldCom were found to have feet of clay, corporate governance has been a hot issue globally. But perhaps too much emphasis on the structure of boards and the number of independent directors on them misses the point. There have been innumerable instances, both in India and abroad, of malfeasance in companies with several independent directors. It is unrealistic, therefore, to lay too much stress on the exact number of independent directors on company boards. 

 A far better approach would be to thrash out the matter with corporates and arrive at a consensus on the issue before incorporating it in the new companies bill. Rather, the focus should be on increasing transparency in companies and strengthening the function of the audit committee ? several of the other recommendations of the Irani committee achieve precisely that objective. Many Indian promoters have restructured their companies and increased transparency, not so much because of the new corporate governance rules, but because institutional and well-informed investors are increasingly rewarding companies that are transparent and have a good governance record. Perhaps, in the final analysis, it is the market that is the best guarantor of corporate governance.

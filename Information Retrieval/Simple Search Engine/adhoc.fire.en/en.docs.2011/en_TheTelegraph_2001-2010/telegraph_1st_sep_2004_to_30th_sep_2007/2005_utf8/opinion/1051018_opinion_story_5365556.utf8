 PUT OFF, FOR NOW

 Those who stall economic reforms only delay the inevitable. The left?s success in stalling the divestment of the government?s share in Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited cannot be good news for the economy. But its return to the coordination committee of the left and the United Progressive Alliance must be a good signal for political stability. A continuing confrontation between the left and the Congress could send out wrong signals to investors who are upbeat about India?s economic prospects. That was why both the prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, and the UPA chairperson, Ms Sonia Gandhi, were keen to woo the left back to the panel. At the same time, they must have been anxious not to surrender the government?s reforms programme to the left?s tactics. Hence the government?s decision to steer a middle course that put the Bhel divestment on hold but made no promises on other Navaratna units, as demanded by the left. Even for Bhel, the government did not strike off the divestment proposal; it promised to only put it in abeyance. Compulsions of coalition politics and the government?s dependence on the left?s support for its survival may cause such frictions again. But the left would look rather silly if it uses threats every now and then. After all, by its own admission, the left too has its compulsion to ensure the stability of the UPA government. 

 However, it is important to see through the fallacy of the left?s argument over Bhel or other Navaratna units. It cannot be a government?s business to run industrial units. And, it cannot be a valid economic argument that the public sector units are to be protected because they provide secure employment. The leftist leaders cannot be unaware of the fact that even China has been dismantling or restructuring its loss-making state-owned enterprises. Second, the divestment of the government?s shares in such units could provide it with additional resources. The left insists too on the government taking up major schemes for rural employment, development of infrastructure and investments in the social sector. Additional resources mobilized through divestments could provide for such projects. The left?s position reflects its lack of vision of a regenerated economy that can create not only many more jobs but also a new world of opportunities. It would be a pity if the left has its way in derailing reforms.

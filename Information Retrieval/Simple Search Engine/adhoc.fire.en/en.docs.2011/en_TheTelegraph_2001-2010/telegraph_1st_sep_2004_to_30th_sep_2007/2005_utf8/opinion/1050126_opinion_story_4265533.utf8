 POOR LITTLE BIG CATS

 Leopards are less of a threat to humans than poisonous snakes or speeding vehicles, says Vidya Athreya. So why the clamour to capture them? 

 In hostile territory

 A leopard was recently trapped in the Sinhagad forests on the outskirts of Pune. Probably, it hadn?t learnt that it ought not to show even a glimpse of himself to humans. For lately, humans have become increasingly intolerant of these animals even if they live peacefully, leading their own lives and helping to get rid of the stray dogs and cattle that abound the country. 

 We want to live near the forests, get away from the smog-filled cities, enjoy the greenery, the chirping of birds and the pure light of the sun streaming through French windows, but we do not want the animals that go with it. Pretty peacocks and little forest creatures that will not trouble us are okay. Even leopards are fine as long as they are behind bars, but not if they are sitting on the fence of the colony or passing through our land.

 In contrast, much of the rural populace, especially those belonging to the older generation, continue to have a lot of respect for all animals. People in some areas in Junnar, which faced numerous leopard attacks in 2001 and 2003, still tell the forest department not to trap the leopards that live on their land because they pride themselves in being able to live with the animals. We, city-dwellers, should learn from such people who show a remarkable tolerance to other species.

 Before I am criticized of being far removed from the problem, let me say that I live in Narayangaon, the most affected area in Junnar. Six leopards were trapped less than a kilometre from my house, the complex I live in has a thin barbed-wire fence and not the high walls that the people around the Sanjay Gandhi National Park in Borivali, Mumbai do. I have a small child, like many other parents who live here and like some who have lost their little ones to leopard attacks.

 Why leopards are creating a problem in some places and not others and at some times and not others is a separate matter. This article only highlights the unfairness with which we humans treat the cats.

 Due to some quirk of biology, leopards are very easy to trap using baited cages. The other carnivores that live around humans and attack livestock in Maharashtra are wolves and hyaenas. However, these species do not enter the traps at all, perhaps owing to their far superior sense of smell. Thus, even if it were a wolf that killed a goat or a child, the cage set up to trap the offender will target a leopard. 

 Let us compare the leopard to another species of animals which also kills people. Poisonous snakes kill a minimum of 10,000 people a year in India. In the event of a fatal cobra bite, in many cases the snake goes free since there is no way of locating these elusive creatures or trapping them. How many people die in road accidents in Pune? Just the fatalities numbered 309 in 2002 with far more cases of injuries. After an accident, do we demand that all or some vehicular traffic be halted immediately? A leopard sighting makes the local people put pressure on the forest department to trap the animals. 

 In Junnar, a total of 83 attacks by leopards were reported in 10 years since 1993. Of these, about 24 were fatal. In all these years, never has an attempt been made to find out whether any attack was accidental ? my guess is that most attacks are. Like the time a leopard came into a house chasing a dog and attacked the owner who happened to be there. 

 In the Sinhagad area where the leopard was recently trapped, there has been no fatalities for as long as I remember. Even so, the people of Sinhagad wanted the animal trapped. They will sit back satisfied that a leopard has been trapped. It does not matter if it was the same one, it does not matter that it might have to spend all its life in captivity, or that it might die after it is moved to a completely new habitat in the wild, or that its family might be adversely affected, or its cubs killed by a new male who takes over its territory.

 I used to think compassion towards animals was something Indians were proud of. I find that with time and changing cultural values, we are taking on the Western intolerance for anything that might cause even the slightest pain to a human being. In the West, even gardens are sprayed routinely with herbicides to prevent weeds from growing. It does not matter that this adversely affects the butterflies whose lives revolve around these islands of green. 

 Leopards, like humans, have strong territorial instincts and are known to come back to their site of capture across hundreds of kilometres. In one instance in Africa, a leopard travelled 540 kms to its site of capture. The cat species also has strong familial bonds, which are manifested differently from ours. A male is the mate of several females in its territory and protects them. A male newcomer immediately kills all the cubs in its territory so that it can sire its own cubs at the earliest.

 The next time we complain about a leopard near our homes, we should give a thought to who is the encroacher. We should also remember that this planet was made for all of us.

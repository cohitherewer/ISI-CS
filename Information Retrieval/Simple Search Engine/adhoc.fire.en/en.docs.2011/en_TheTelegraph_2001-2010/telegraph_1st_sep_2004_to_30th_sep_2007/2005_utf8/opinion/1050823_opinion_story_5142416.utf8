 TIME TO CALL THE BLUFF

 MALVIKA SINGH

 It is truly ironic that Manmohan Singh, who initially broke the shackles of the command economy and began to free the spirit of Indian entrepreneurship, is today, a decade-and-a-half later, with himself at the helm, bringing dead jargon, failed policies, foolish fiscal structures and archaic methodologies of development and change back into the realm of ?governance?. It is tragic to say the very least. There is a complete intellectual vacuum in the government and its agencies. Not one innovative, exciting and challenging idea or method to correct the wrongs. This is no way to bring about the ?equitable distribution of wealth?. Nor will this stale, unthinking mindset and unacceptable arrogant attitude towards those men and women who generate and multiply wealth through hard endeavour, using their own resources and collaterals, bring Indians across the board to any decent level of life and living. 

 Why does Manmohan Singh want to preside over the backward and regressive slide? Surely he does not believe in this mindlessness? How can a prime minister be effective and purposeful if he has to operate, on every critical issue, by adjusting and going against his considered beliefs? Does he want India to remain where it is? Does he want to discriminate against castes and creeds and help tear the fabric of India into shreds? Is that the ?history in the making? that he was referring to? 

 Garibi Hatao is critical to this subcontinent. Every government since independence has spouted this slogan in some manner, shape or form. Neither the left, right, nor centre did anything for the ?poor?, or for that matter, for anyone other than their own reserved tribe, once they sat on the treasury benches. Shameful. Monies allocated in plan upon plan never reached the people at the ?grassroots?. Only a trickle happened. The bulk of all allocations were chewed up by rulers and their administrators, regardless of ?colour?, emblem or flag. 

 Pro-poor, anyone?

 The United Progressive Alliance is presiding over a new and fresh demand to grab and extract more monies from those who work and generate wealth, in an attempt to refill their dwindling coffers, robbed over decades by the ?authority? that rules this nation. Politicians have caused unimaginable divides in society and have created, for posterity, the horror of vote banks. This has been the singularly most divisive contribution to India by the elected few. 

 The bureaucrats continue to function as did their colonial masters, with that arrogant condescension. These men and women have effectively corroded and corrupted the entire ?steel frame? of the civil service. There is neither civility nor service. There is plain exploitation. And, to speak out has become a dirty word in this context. India has been damaged physically and psychologically. These people have no right to talk about the ?exploitation by the capitalist class?! 

 ?Red? China has shunned the horrors of Mao and ?his? mass killings of his own people. The poor were very, very poor there till China decided to pull itself out of the quagmire. The country has moved ahead, put its failed ideology and methodology behind it, and has begun to deliver goods and services at home and abroad. China is giving dignity of life and purpose to the Chinese. They are way ahead of India as our lefties harp on about what they learned from ?ole? Mao! The double talk of the CPI(M) is much like the double talk of the BJP/RSS. They open up West Bengal because they are ruling there and realize there is no other option if they have to create wealth for their people. But, in the same breath, they destroy the Congress and the UPA government by saying and demanding the opposite. This is the regressive and suffocating trait of extreme and stunted ideologies. Kill change to preserve yourself. Call the bluff!

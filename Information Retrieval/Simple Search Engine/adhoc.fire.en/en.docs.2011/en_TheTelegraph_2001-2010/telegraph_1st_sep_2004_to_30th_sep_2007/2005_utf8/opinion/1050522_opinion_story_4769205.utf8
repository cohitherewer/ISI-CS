 PRESSURE TO PERFORM

 If Mr Manmohan Singh were to go back to his alma mater, St John?s College, Cambridge, and over a cup of tea with the Master discuss his first year?s performance, he would probably be told that he deserves a beta for effort. No special words would be uttered for either originality or achievement. Such an assessment would sadden and disappoint Mr Singh who as a tripos student at St John?s did not fetch such low grades from his tutors. The fact that his own assessment of his performance ? six on ten ? matches what would be his alma mater?s evaluation will bring small comfort to Mr Singh, who is known for having exacting personal standards. But in the scale for measuring prime ministerial performance, high personal standards are only one element. Public achievement and the ability to put one?s indelible mark on public affairs are what distinguishes the ordinary from the extraordinary at the level of leading the nation. Ironically for Mr Singh, he left his distinctive mark on Indian public life when he heralded a new era of liberalization as the finance minister under P.V. Narasimha Rao. As prime minister, he has not been altogether successful in pushing forward his own unfinished agenda of economic reforms. If as finance minister, Mr Singh had succeeded, to an extent, to divorce economics from politics, as prime minister he has allowed politics to determine economics.

 In the political arena, Mr Singh?s exacting personal standards have not been all that evident. Political compulsions have made him sup with the devil. There can be no other explanation for seeing Mr Singh in the company of the likes of Mr Shibu Soren and Mr Laloo Prasad Yadav. The logic of coalition politics obviously has very little space for moral prickliness. In foreign policy, the one area which is relatively free from the pressures of maintaining a coalition and in which it is easy for a leader to leave his own imprint, Mr Singh has floundered. Neither in the neighbourhood nor in India?s relationship with the wider world has Mr Singh?s government shown any special flair. Indeed, with unenviable innocence, India allowed Mr Pervez Musharraf to run away with the colours when all that the Pakistan president wanted was to watch a cricket match. Regarding Nepal too, Indian policy has been like a rudderless ship.

 This litany of non-achievement has to be seen in the context of Mr Singh?s fragile support base within the Lok Sabha. It is difficult for him to alienate any of his allies. On the one hand, it has forced him to break bread with politicians with shady pasts, and on the other, he has had to accommodate the left on a number of issues concerning economic reforms. These pressures notwithstanding, Mr Singh has given to the polity a modicum of stability; to the economy he has brought buoyancy; and created an air of optimism and expectation all around. Hence, the recommendation for effort. The gears of government must shift to achievement in the second year for the beta to become alpha.

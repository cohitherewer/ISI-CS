 AT THE CENTRE 

 His time in the sun

An Umpire Remembers : An Autobiography of Piloo Reporter, 

Rupa, Rs 295

In the foreword, Sunil Gavaskar writes ?Isn?t everybody 

curious to know what Imran Khan said to Viv Richards after he had just clobbered 

him to the boundary or over it? Wouldn?t fans like to know what transpired between 

Warne and Tendulkar?...Who better to tell this, than the umpires who were right 

there?? Armed with the Little Master?s foreword and a vivid recall of Harold ?Dicky? 

Bird?s bestseller, My Autobiography, the book raised high expectations: 

could this be India?s answer to the autobiography of ?perhaps the most famous 

umpire in the history of the game?? Although Reporter does not live up to the 

expectations, he takes the reader on an entertaining ride, starting at the club 

level in the early Sixties and culminating spectacularly in cricket?s biggest 

event, the World Cup, three decades later.

 He is candid about his disappointments. Being overlooked several times before making his test debut, not being included in the panel for the 1987 World Cup and a disaster of his benefit match when the meticulously planned one-dayer was washed out by rain without a single ball being bowled. At the same time, he considers himself fortunate to be appointed the first ?neutral? test umpire in seven decades for the 1986-87 series between Pakistan and West Indies, completing a hat-trick of test matches at home in the series against West Indies, umpiring the Nehru Cup final and being appointed the sole Indian umpire at the 1992 World Cup Down Under.

 A firm believer in the use of technology for ?line? decisions, he cites a relevant example. On the third day of the first test, ?Ravi Shastri flashed hard at Winston Davis, and ?Flash? Gordon Greenidge, standing at gully, bent low and snapped up the ball at shoe-height. From my position at square-leg, I thought that it was a very neat catch. But Gordon immediately indicated that he had taken it on the first bounce...Had there been an appeal and my colleague had consulted me, I would have ruled against the batsman.?

 ?The final of the Jawaharlal Nehru Cup was the most memorable match of my umpiring career?. The match played between Pakistan and West Indies at his favourite Eden Gardens, before a capacity crowd, was a thriller. Pakistan won with a ball to spare. In this match, Reporter displayed the firmness of an experienced umpire. In previous matches, Salim Malik habitually left the field on the pretext of being injured while fielding, but made a ?miraculous? recovery when his turn came to bat. Viv Richards had told Reporter prior to the match that he would not allow any such gamesmanship. Malik left the field during the first drinks interval. Imran Khan casually mentioned this to Reporter, who had Malik brought back on the field. And when Desmond Haynes wanted to do a Malik, he would not allow it either, remarking, ?Dessie, what applies to the goose applies to the gander.?

 Reporter has indulged in picking ?Dream Teams?. He has four of them. Two each for India and World XI for tests and one-day internationals. In his Dream Test World XI, he has Imran Khan, Javed Miandad and Viv Richards. No dispute there. In his Dream World XI-ODIs, he has Arjuna Ranatunga as captain, no Imran or Javed and Greg Matthews as the specialist spinner. Piloo could have done better.

 Ravi Shastri gets the nod as captain of both Indian Test and ODI XI over the likes of Gavaskar and Kapil Dev, even though he led India in only one test against West Indies, which India won, and captained in a single ODI series at Sharjah, which India won too. However, I have to disagree with his choice of Manoj Prabhakar and Narendra Hirwani in the Test XI over Javagal Srinath and Anil Kumble, both of whom are chosen for the ODI XI.

 BURNING OUT

 There could not be a more vexing instance of the link between education and juvenile violence. Boys of classes VIII and IX ? they would be 14 to 15 years old ? studying in a high school in Maldah set their school on fire on Saturday morning for having been failed in their annual examinations. Their main target was the teachers? common room, and it took firemen almost three hours to put out the fire. After getting to know their results, they first tried to force the head teacher to pass them. When this teacher refused, they then threatened to burn the school down, and eventually carried out this threat. From classes V to IX, around 50 students had failed their annual examinations.

 This incident and the noticeable rise in student suicides in Bengal are the obverse and reverse of the same crisis in primary and secondary education. Yet this is a crisis that has alarmingly wide social implications. The most fundamental problem is one of sheer numbers. The government as well as the private education system in Bengal ? rural, urban and in the districts ? is trying to sustain an infrastructure that simply cannot cope with the number of students availing themselves of it. The other, equally basic problem is with the social, particularly parental, attitude to higher education ? the desperation with which children are made to run through the education system until they graduate, and the parallel desperation with which the system itself sustains a ruthless method of elimination at every stage. Both processes put relentless pressure on young students, and foster a competitiveness that could either fill them with despair and an unbearable sense of failure or with aggression that could take the form of organized corruption or violence. Beating up invigilators who prevent cheating during examinations is another expression of such aggressiveness. Suicide or arson ? the violence is either directed at oneself or at the institution itself.

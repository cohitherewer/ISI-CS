 CUT FOR VALUE

 Axes never fall painlessly. A little more than 1,400 students who have cleared their joint entrance tests will now find it difficult or impossible to enter engineering colleges all over West Bengal. The All India Council for Technical Education has slashed 38,101 seats all over the country in engineering, pharmacy, MBA and MCA courses. Out of these, 1,438 are in West Bengal, and are in such institutions as Jadavpur University and Meghnad Saha Insitute of Technology in Calcutta. So both government and private institutes have been affected by this sudden dawning of a concern for standards. In this, the AICTE?s rationale is understandable. These colleges and departments have been warned repeatedly about the inadequacy of their infrastructure and standards, particularly in the number of qualified teachers they could manage to provide the students with. So, the students were simply not getting their money?s worth, and were being given degrees that would get them no jobs at all. So, the AICTE?s move was geared towards maintaining standards in higher education, and in that it may be hoped that putting a batch of students through this kind of trouble would pay off eventually. 

 But many of these sub-standard private colleges have come into being largely because of the state government allowing them, almost overnight, to mushroom all over Bengal. There was a sudden change of attitude towards the private sector in higher education, with the government deciding to withdraw gradually from it, and so it seemed convenient for the government to allow them to exist, whatever be the standard of the services they offered those who were willing to pay the money. It is therefore paradoxical that the consequence of the government?s ?privatization? policy would end up looking so precisely like governmental high-handedness. From such seemingly arbitrary and ad hoc measures, it is difficult to discern signs of any systematically thought-through vision of what higher education in technology would entail, and of what the state regulatory body?s role, or non-role, would be in the private institutes at least. If decentralization is the ultimate goal, then such moves create absolutely the opposite impression. Vigilance regarding standards is a very good thing, but it must come with a consistent position on such things and must cause the least trouble for students.

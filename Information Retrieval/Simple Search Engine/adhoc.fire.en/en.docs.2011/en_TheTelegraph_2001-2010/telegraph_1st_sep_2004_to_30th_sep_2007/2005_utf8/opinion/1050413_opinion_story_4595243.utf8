 Letters to Editor

 Get down to earth

 Sir ? Somnath Chatterjee may have cited ?my country?s prestige? in calling off his visit to Australia, but it seems that the issue here is false vanity (?Frisk shy speaker calls off trip?, April 8). In all countries passengers are subjected to frisking before they board an aircraft, except heads of state or government. The same rule applies at Indian airports, but most politicians and senior bureaucrats are ?exempted? from it. Such preferential treatment is not statutory, but the VIPs get used to this and expect the same treatment abroad. Sadly, this is not possible. And just in case we do extend this ?courtesy? to visiting dignitaries, we must stop it. Such persons obey similar laws in their countries, after all. To say that the speaker should not be considered a criminal or a potential risk is an insult to other passengers. By this logic, all ?common? passengers are criminals or potential risks to aircraft! 

 Yours faithfully,

Sima Mitra, Toronto

 A new journey

 Sir ? The editorial, ?Price of hype? (April 8), asserts that ?militant groups were provoked to mount a desperate attack on the passengers? as a result of the publicity generated by the government over the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service. I agree that there was too much fanfare about the bus service. But saying that this provoked militants is tantamount to offering a dangerous and irresponsible rationalization for the militants? activity. Are we, in a free society, to behave in only such manner that we do not ?provoke? the more extreme elements who are a part of it but have rejected dialogue for violence? By the same token, should we refrain from buying cards on Valentine?s Day for fear of provoking the hired goons of some political parties? Shall we not put on trial those militants who have been caught by the state for fear of provoking a backlash? And does this mean that if the bus service had not been built up as it was, the militants would have not made an attempt to sabotage it? 

 Yours faithfully,

Chandrahas Choudhury, Mumbai

 Sir ? This is not the first time the government has taken recourse to bus diplomacy ? there were the Delhi-Lahore and Calcutta-Dhaka buses earlier. As an effort to bridge the gap between the people of the two Kashmirs, the bus deserved its due share of media coverage. But the hype was a little overdone. In comparison, the flagging off of the bus service between Calcutta and Dhaka, and between Agartala and Dhaka was definitely low key. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sumana Roy, Shyamnagar

 Sir ? It is not possible to heal a wound, more than 50-years-old, by running buses between Muzaffarabad and Srinagar. Leaders of the two countries, taking into consideration the will of the people of Kashmir, must go to the root of the problem. India should also see through Pakistan?s double-standards ? buying F-16s from the Americans on the one hand and running peace buses on the other.

 Yours faithfully,

Anirban Das, Chandannagore,

 Sir ? On the Indian side, it was the prime minister who flagged off the bus, while on the other side, there was the prime minister of Azad Kashmir. Is this not a de facto recognition of Azad Kashmir? The Western powers are happy at the fall of this ?Berlin Wall? and our politicians are happy to have the approval of the West.

 Yours faithfully,

Santanu Datta, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The attack by Islamic militants on the tourist reception centre in Srinagar shows their desperation at not being able to disrupt the peace process between India and Pakistan. However, it is sad that civilians are being attacked in the name of Islam, contrary to its core values of love, peace and brotherhood. In the circumstances, the passengers of the ?caravan of peace? need to be lauded for having faith in the Indian government and undertaking the historic journey at considerable risk to their lives. But clearly, we need to step up our intelligence and security network. After all, this is only the beginning.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? The Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service shows that the people of India and Pakistan want peace and friendship. But, unfortunately, the Pakistanis have no say in what their government does; their aspirations have been crushed under the boots of a dictator. It also appears that the Indian leaders are overplaying their enthusiasm in a bid to extract political mileage from the bus service. 

 Yours faithfully,

S.P. Sharma, Mumbai

 Sir ? Have people forgotten Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the man who started off the peace process with Pakistan? And in just one year?

 Yours faithfully,

Soham Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? The targeting of passengers sheltered inside 

the heavily guarded building exposes the vulnerability of our security blanket. 

Can we deny that the leaders of both sides have made the journey a matter of prestige, 

instead of taking a sensible approach? Not only have they endangered the lives 

of the passengers during the journey, but the latter must be on razor?s edge even 

after they return. The politicians should realize that nothing can be achieved 

in the Valley without taking the militants into confidence. 

Yours faithfully,

Md.Ayub Ansari, Jagatdal

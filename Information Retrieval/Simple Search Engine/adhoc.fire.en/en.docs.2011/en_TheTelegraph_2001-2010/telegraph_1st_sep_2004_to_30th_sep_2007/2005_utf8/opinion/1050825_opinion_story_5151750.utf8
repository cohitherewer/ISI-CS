 EXCESS QUOTA

 It was one of the sharpest rebukes for the government from the highest court of the land. When the Supreme Court, in an access of exasperation, suggests that the government shut down all courts so it can do whatever it likes, both the event and the spectacle are disturbing. The particular issue over which the storm broke was the public interest litigation regarding quotas for Dalit Christians. The government feels that this is a policy matter, not the court?s business. Neither is this new. The judiciary and the government have been stepping on each other?s toes quite frequently, with the court being criticized for intervention. The government also seems to go out of its way to claim it is not ?confrontationist?, an implication that has intensely irked the judiciary. The immediate background to the taut scene in the courtroom was the government?s resentment of the Supreme Court?s decision to free unaided educational institutions from implementing government quotas. It seems to have been the hidden load of tensions rather than the actual matter in hand that ignited the tinderbox. The impression is of missed or mistaken communication, perhaps a misunderstanding ? a blow-up without immediate and adequate substance.

 The balance of power between the government and the judiciary, or rather, among the executive, legislature and the judiciary, has long been less than perfect, with the court emerging often as the strongest voice. Even the suspicion of such an imbalance is unhealthy for the edifice of democracy, and the court?s stepping out of its purview has not been taken well. While this is undoubtedly unfortunate, it has to be asked what the government is doing. Matters come to court only when there is a deadlock. Where the court can, at worst, be seen as intervening, politicians are seen as unscrupulous, self-serving, reckless and indifferent to public good and to justice. Their preference for the backdoor does their case no good. Even now, the government is planning a law to bypass the court?s orders about unaided institutions. The only way out of this deeply disconcerting situation is to use those democratic tools, debate and discussion, more frequently and to greater effect. The correctness of law and the nuances of politics need not be placed contrariwise; there must also be a space where they meet. It might help preserve the balance of power.

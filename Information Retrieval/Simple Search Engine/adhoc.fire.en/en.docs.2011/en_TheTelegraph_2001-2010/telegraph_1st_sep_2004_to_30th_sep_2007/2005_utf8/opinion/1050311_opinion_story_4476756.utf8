 THE LORD OF THE SEAS

Transition to eminence: The Indian navy, 1976-90,

By G.M. HIRANANDANI

Lancer, Rs 1,500 

The Indian navy?s emergence as a force to reckon with 

in south Asian waters can be traced back to the Indo-Pak conflict in 1971. Security 

experts have been debating about the present combat effectiveness of the Indian 

navy for sometime now. Vice admiral G.M. Hiranandani?s book is likely to answer 

some of the questions raised in the course of this debate.

 Hiranandani?s present work is rich in facts. The author, being a high ranking naval officer, has had the advantage of accessing sensitive material in military archives. However, the book is unlikely to ruffle the feathers of the establishment as it largely concentrates on Indian naval successes.

 Being a naval officer himself, Hiranandani is good when it comes to providing technical details about India?s maritime infrastructure. The navy, as compared to the army and the airforce, has been more successful in manufacturing effective weapon systems. Yet, the author says that most Indian ships till the early Nineties were of indigenous make and their spare parts were imported. The navy, even today, imports small patrol boats. The country is far from being self-reliant in naval affairs, warns the author.

 Sadly, Hiranandani gives very little information on the tactical and operational aspects of the navy. For instance, readers would not know how the Indian navy plans to deploy its various weapons, like minesweepers, rocket boats and frigates. The author also mentions the ideas of Nazi admiral, Eric Raeder, on naval warfare. This is interesting because Indian naval officers have traditionally followed British and American strategists regarding naval affairs. 

 Although Hiranandani does not record the opinions of naval experts, he seems to suggest that the navy is a divided house. Some naval officers support the move to purchase aircraft carriers while the anti-aircraft carrier lobby feels that in the age of guided missiles and submarines, the carriers are a luxury. Debates on Indian naval strategy have also been left out.

 Hiranandani also fails to suggest how the Indian navy should cope with new developments on subcontinental waters. K.R. Singh, an expert in naval affairs, says that the Indian navy would not be able to attack Karachi now as Pakistan has upgraded its air-defence system. Hiranandani does not say anything about how India should respond to such a threat. He is also silent about the nuclearization of the navy.

 All said and done, those interested in India?s maritime affairs would find the book worthwhile despite its shortcomings.

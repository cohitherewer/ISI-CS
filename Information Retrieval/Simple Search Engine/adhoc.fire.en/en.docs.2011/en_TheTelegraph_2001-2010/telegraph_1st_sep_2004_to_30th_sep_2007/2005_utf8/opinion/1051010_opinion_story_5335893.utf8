 HARDER TIMES

 It is a strange situation when the highest court in the land must tell the other courts what kind of sentence they should impose. Yet a tendency to impose light sentences on proven rapists has left the Supreme Court with no alternative. Rape is not just the ?violation of an individual?, the court has said, but a crime against society and human dignity, one that ?reduces a man to an animal?. Therefore a rapist, once convicted, should be awarded the minimum of 10 years? imprisonment, if not longer. Fewer years can be awarded for special reasons, which should be elucidated in the sentence. But delay in the trial, the age of the offender and his offer to marry the victim shall not be considered mitigating factors. The Supreme Court?s comments, made in the context of a mild sentence awarded to a rapist by the Madhya Pradesh high court, are both timely and reassuring. But the premises upon which they have been made bear closer examination.

 The rate of convictions for rape in India is abysmally low. The untiring efforts of activists have brought about greater awareness about the need for sensitivity, and some changes in law, but society?s attitude remains virtually unchanged. It is not possible to comprehend the full impact of the violation of a woman?s body, the destruction of her sense of self and humanness, as long as women are seen, almost unconsciously, as child-bearing machines meant to look after men and homes. Besides, there is associated with rape a deep, perhaps deliberate, confusion with the values of masculinity and ideas about ?natural? masculine desire that obscure its relationship with power, contempt and violence. The court has rightly eliminated age and the offer of marriage as two of the commoner ?mitigating? circumstances. Yet it has needed to mention that rape is a ?crime against society? and against ?human dignity? to emphasize the gravity of the offence, as if the implications of ?violation of an individual? were not enough. The court?s comments could be read to mean that society needs women unviolated by rape, which would imply a reassertion of masculinist values. And whose dignity is at stake here? Is it the rapist?s, who is reduced to an animal by his own will and act? If that is so, the premise should be that the ?shame? of rape is never the woman?s. The Supreme Court is incisively clear about its intention; it would be even more reassuring if the assumptions behind its comments were made clearer.

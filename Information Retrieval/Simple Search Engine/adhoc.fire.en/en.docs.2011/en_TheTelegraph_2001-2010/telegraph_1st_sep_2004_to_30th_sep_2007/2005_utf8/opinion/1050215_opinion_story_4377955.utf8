 START COUNTING

 The election results are just a prelude to democracy in Iraq. The country remains a fractious constituency, without any neat political divisions, and trapped between occupation and insurgency. But there is still something dramatic in the resurgence of the country?s Shia Muslims, whose exclusion from power went back to the creation of Iraq out of the Ottoman empire in 1920. And after the sole-candidate referendums of the Ba?athist dictatorship ? the last proper elections were in 1958 ? the announcement of these results must have felt like the beginning of a new era, even if the 58 per cent turnout undermines international optimism. The sense of new beginnings remains beset with uncertainties and dangers. First, whether the character of the Shia domination will be Islamist or secular remains to be seen. Between the Grand Ayatollah, who is the spiritual leader of the coalition, and the urbane economist, Mr Adel Abdul Mahdi, the nature of the Shia leadership will determine everything from personal laws to the principles of governance. Yet the divided nature of the results will complicate this domination. The Kurdish alliance, including Christian and Turkoman elements, will now be very much a part of the new order of things. These two main coalitions will have to work out a way of sharing power in the 275-member national assembly. Finally, the Sunni minorities, who had largely preferred to stay out of the elections, must be drawn into the process somehow. Otherwise, a political solution to the insurgency can never be achieved. The restive towns of Falluja and Ramadi are in a Sunni Arab province, only 2 per cent of whose eligible voters turned out to vote. The Kurds will perhaps be better at drawing in the Sunnis than the Shias, and a symbolic solution would be to have a Kurdish president, a Shia prime minister and a Sunni speaker.

 The main task of this national assembly, it must be remembered, is to draw up a draft constitution for Iraq by August. This constitution will then be presented to the people for approval in a referendum by October, after which a general election will have to be held by December 15. It is at this referendum that the Sunnis might choose to exercise greater agency than they did during these polls. Democracy in Iraq will depend on the unfolding of this process, and on the other crucial timeline ? that of the departure of foreign forces.

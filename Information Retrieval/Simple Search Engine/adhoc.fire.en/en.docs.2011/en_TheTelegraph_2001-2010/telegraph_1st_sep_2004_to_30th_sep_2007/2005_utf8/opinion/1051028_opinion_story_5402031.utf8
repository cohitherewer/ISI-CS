 IN SEARCH OF LIGHT 

 Education and democracy in India Edited by Anne Vaugier-Chatterjee,

 Manohar, Rs 695

 Given the fact that Education and Democracy in India took several years in the making, one would have expected a certain scholarly rigour and professionalism from the volume. Yet, the book leaves one with the impression of a hurriedly put together, poorly edited collection of essays, a few of which turn out to be rather repetitive and reiterate well-known facts.

 In her introduction, the editor, Anne Vaugier-Chatterjee, mentions that the essays, written by historians, political scientists and educationists from India and Europe, focus on five themes: the history of education in India, decentralization of education, finances, sociology and ideological trends. However, the introduction fails to spell the names of the contributors correctly, the page headers do not tally and there are numerous typos in the text.

 However, one must admit that a few of these essays raise important questions about contemporary Indian education. Some are also based on painstaking field work. While the essays look at diverse issues, most contributors agree that education policies have not fulfilled their commitment to the poor sections of Indian society. Several essayists also warn that successive governments, in trying to make education available to as many as possible, have compromised on the quality of education that is on offer.

 A number of essayists focus on groups excluded from education ? R.P. Singh talks about tribes, scheduled castes, the poor and disabled children while Aparna Basu and Gouri Srivastava focus on women?s education. The volume starts with Ambrose Pinto?s essay which argues that there is a need to recognize the contribution of missionary education to democratizing Indian society. Christian missionaries are also credited by Aparna Basu for striving to educate girls along modern lines.

 Samia Kazi Aoul, Sumit Bose, Anne Vaugier-Chatterjee and Francois Leclerq state that the Education Guarantee Scheme, which provides for demand-driven expansion of education in Madhya Pradesh, is an important step but it has its shortcomings as well. 

 Shalini Advani looks at the English textbook and the classroom teaching of English and finds that they are designed to preserve the elite status of English speakers. Akshay Bakaya examines the myths propagated by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh in schools controlled by it while Jayati and Gyaneshwar Chaturvedi take a look at the construction of saffron identity in Uttar Pradesh.

 Krishna Kumar talks about critical issues like the irrelevance of colonial education to the understanding of local realities, the status of Indian teachers, and the reluctance of the state in upgrading educational infrastructure and its corresponding support to telecom services and airports.

 Letters to Editor

 So little choice

 Sir ? From the report, ?In brothel, by choice? (Oct 21), it does not appear that the young housewife who took to prostitution in Shantipur had any real ?choice? about her profession. Her grief, poverty and hunger drove her to the brothel. I am doubtful whether anyone in her right senses, and without a stomach to feed, would have made such a choice. Even though Prashanta Sil?s wife is a commoner, we should respect her, if not her choice. The Telegraph should keep doing the good job it is doing, without the headlines which show that little thought has gone into them.

 Yours faithfully,

 Meghna Bhattacharya, Connecticut, US

 Bitter harvest

 Sir ? The recent hike in vegetable prices, like that of onion, and of LPG all over the country has imposed a tremendous burden on consumers. The price of onion has gone through the roof. To control the situation, especially since it is festival time, the government has turned to China and Pakistan for help. The imports are supposed to stabilize prices. But when is that going to happen? When politicians, babus and middlemen have exploited the situation to the hilt? The prices of both onions and gas have been artificially driven up at the expense of the common people and to the benefit of dishonest businessmen. The government should ensure that distribution stays as normal as possible and that market laws are followed.

 Yours faithfully,

Rajib Dey, Habra

 Sir ? The Union agriculture minister, Sharad Pawar, was initially not interested in solving the onion crisis to give onion-growers in Maharashtra a chance to make a killing. It is unbecoming of a senior minister to stoop so low. Imported onions are expected to lower prices, but perhaps not more than a rupee or two. Onions are capable of bringing down governments. I fail to understand what stopped the government from importing one lakh tons of onions immediately and selling them at Rs 5 less than the artificially hiked up market prices so that the overall prices could be brought down. The government, reportedly, would have lost Rs 50 crore by doing so. But isn?t the government selling domestic gas and kerosene at subsidized rates and losing thousands of crores for the benefit of the poor? 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Onion prices have skyrocketed as there is a shortage in the market, owing to the destruction of crops by rains. And the government is leaving no stone unturned to sell onions at controlled prices. But are onions so important? Can?t housewives cook food without it? Many people do not eat onions. Can we say that they are denying themselves healthy food? People must learn to make do without onions when there is such an acute shortage of the vegetable and the prices are high. That is, if they want to prevent politicians and dalals from making the most of the situation. 

 Yours faithfully,

Mahesh Kapasi, New Delhi

 Sir ? When onion prices had shot up during the National Democratic Alliance regime, Jaspal Bhatti had sought police protection while he purchased the ?precious? vegetable. The Congress, at that time, had denigrated the NDA for misrule because it could not provide the basic needs of the people at affordable prices. Today the prices of onions are again sky-high. Should we then surmise that the Congress is unable to run the country? And what about Bhatti and his police escort? I think the police have no time as they too must be buying their supply of onions. As expected, the NDA is in no mood to let go of the opportunity to capitalize on the chinks in the armour of the United Progressive Alliance.

 Yours faithfully,

 Harischandra Parashuram, Mumbai

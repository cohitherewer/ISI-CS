 Letters to Editor

 Dressing down

 Sir ? Our full sympathies for the army chief who has to preach peace to a trigger-happy workforce. But is the job so difficult as to push General Joginder Jaswant Singh to ridiculous extents (?Friday dressing booted out?, Feb 11)? If the general truly believes that the army he leads is ?constantly? at war, why do his men in the army headquarters have to dress in combat uniform only on Fridays? Is the army not in constant war on the other days of the week? And what happens in the army cantonments? The people of this country, especially those in combat zones, would be grateful to Singh if he kept to his original intentions ? of improving army-civilian relations. Hitting the bull?s eye or strutting about in combat uniform may reinstate Singh as the rightful successor to his chair among his men, but it will do nothing to better the army?s image where it matters.

 Yours faithfully,

N. Srivastava, Calcutta

 Going, going, Goan

 Sir ? For the Congress, old habits die hard. There is little doubt that S.C. Jamir, a former Congressman, was sent to Goa as governor to destabilize the Bharatiya Janata Party government. And Jamir has obliged his political masters. The Congress must have worked hard to engineer the defection in the state BJP. When the initial plan to pull the rug from under the feet of the Manohar Parrikar government fell through, it shamelessly used Jamir to sack Parrikar on the grounds that he had manipulated figures with the help of the speaker, Vishwas Satarkar. Is there really any difference between the king?s action in Nepal and that of the governor in Goa? Such gubernatorial indiscretions are legion in India. Earlier, another governor close to the Congress, Romesh Bhandari, had similarly dismissed the Kalyan Singh government in Uttar Pradesh. The decision was overturned by the courts and Singh got back his chief ministership. From the Sixties to the Eighties, opposition-led state governments were dismissed by Congress-led governments at the Centre with gay abandon, in association with the respective governors. Things changed slightly after the Bommai case in 1994. But Goa shows that we have been sadly mistaken.

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Das Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? Both constitutional authorities in Goa have played biased roles in keeping with their political affiliations. A system must be formulated so that only apolitical figures, like retired judges or bureaucrats, are appointed as governors. Speakers have to be made accountable for their decisions, which is why it should be made mandatory for persons occupying the speaker?s seat to give up politics. Further, speakers and deputy speakers should be elected by a secret vote in the assembly and they should have the approval of at least one-third members of the house. No-confidence motions against speakers and deputy speakers should be moved through a secret ballot on the written demand of the same number of members, who should also name an alternative. The right of governors to dismiss and appoint the chief minister arbitrarily should be withdrawn too.

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba

 Sir ? Why has the new Congress government in Goa been given 30 days to prove its majority in the house when it is evident that the governor is biased? Both the speaker and the governor of the state should be dismissed and president?s rule imposed in the state. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shiv Shanker Almal, Calcutta

 Sir ? Why is Goa being seen as a political aberration? It is not unlike what has happened several times in Uttar Pradesh and the governor was within his rights to dismiss a government which had lost its numerical majority. As for hauling up the speaker, Jamir has set a unique precedent which will force speakers to be more careful in their dealings in the house.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Chatterjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? Goa is an example of another illegal takeover by the firm ? read the Nehru-Gandhi family. Every evidence suggests that the BJP regime was forced out. That the gubernatorial knock-out was pre-planned is indicated by S.C. Jamir?s preposterous directive that all 36 members of the legislative assembly cast their vote for the trust motion?s outcome to be deemed valid. This diktat is itself unprecedented and is a clear breach of legislative sovereignty. No governor, sworn to the mandated impartiality of his office, would have moved against the ruling regime without giving it a hearing, even as he lent an ear to the opposition?s complaints. Unfortunately for the Congress, Goa?s new political royalty cannot be anointed constitutionally. The president would be well within his rights to force Jamir?s recall by withdrawing his pleasure. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sagarika Ghose, Siliguri

 Sir ? The events in Goa just go to show that where political interests are concerned, no one cares about democracy. To prevent such a situation from recurring, the posts of the governor and speaker should be made one-time appointments. No extension or reappointment should be allowed. Nor should the holders of the posts be given assignments after retirement. 

 Yours faithfully,

Rabindra S. Guha, Calcutta

 Postscript

 Sir ? The Telegraph, in its February 12 Siliguri edition, reported the death of Arthur Miller ?In Brief? and informed that one had to turn to page 4 for the details. I was disappointed to see that the stipulated page of the edition did not have the ?details? nor any other report, but around 18 notifications and advertisements of different tenders. Miller?s death is significant to people like me who are interested in literature. I request the newspaper to publish a detailed obituary of the playwright and other essays on him.

 Yours faithfully,

Pinaki Roy, Balurghat

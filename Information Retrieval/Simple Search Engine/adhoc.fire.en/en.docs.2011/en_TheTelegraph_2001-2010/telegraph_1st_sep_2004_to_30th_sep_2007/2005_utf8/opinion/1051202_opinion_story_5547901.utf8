 A nation on the move 

 Photographs do indeed tell stories. In the case of INDIA 

 THEN AND NOW (Roli, Price not mentioned) they tell 

 a nation?s history. The most difficult task facing such 

 a project is to determine when ?India then? ends and ?India 

 now? begins. Although Rudrangshu Mukherjee?s introduction 

 to ?India then? seems to draw the line along August 15, 

 1947, it appears from Vir Sanghvi?s text that ?India now? 

 does not begin until the Seventies. There is something about 

 black-and-white and sepia which galactic advances in camera 

 technology and vivid colour have not managed to beat. Pramod 

 Kapoor must be thanked for bringing some rare and unbelievable 

 photographs (such as Beato?s Qutub Minar or the panoramic 

 views of Lucknow and Calcutta) together. However, being 

 heavy as well as reversible, the book demands truly formidable 

 readers.

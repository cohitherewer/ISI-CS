 FAILING VILLAGES

 West Bengal?s failure to provide the most basic healthcare to its people becomes all-encompassing when it comes to the villages. The latest report of the comptroller and auditor general is shocking, although it says nothing that has not been said already or is not perfectly evident. The report covers four districts ? West Midnapore, North 24-Parganas, Bankura and Cooch Behar ? and the comprehensiveness of the failure is what is staggering. None of the targets seems to have been met, ever, and every possible facility or infrastructure is grossly inadequate, ill-maintained, or simply non-existent. The projected expansions in the number of health centres, sub-centres, primary health centres and hospitals are way below what had been planned. The ones that exist lack equipment, instruments, medicines and laboratories, and even the most basic facilities like toilets, electricity and drinking water. In some places, expensive equipment lie unused for lack of trained staff. What emerges most disturbingly from the report is that these rural establishments are all severely and chronically understaffed. Very few doctors, nurses and paramedical staff agree to go to work in the villages. Hence, the simplest illnesses cannot be treated, and crucial services like family-planning measures and anti-rabies vaccination are generally unavailable.

 What happens, it might be asked, to these reports? Presumably nothing. They are placed in the assembly, where they temporarily become subjects of desultory discussion, the opposition rails, ministers plan and pledge, inquiry commissions are formed, and then they are quietly forgotten, until the next report presents an unchanged or worse picture. Rural Bengal confronts the government with a daunting challenge with regard to healthcare. Three important programmes have to be sustained here ? family planning, polio eradication and the prevention, detection and treatment of HIV/AIDS ? apart from the entire range of essential and specialized facilities which any civilized government ought to be able to provide the people. The perpetuation, for decades, of an abysmally inadequate state of affairs has got everything to do with not only misgovernance and corruption, but also a serene confidence in the inability of the poor and the powerless to hold the government accountable to its worst failures.

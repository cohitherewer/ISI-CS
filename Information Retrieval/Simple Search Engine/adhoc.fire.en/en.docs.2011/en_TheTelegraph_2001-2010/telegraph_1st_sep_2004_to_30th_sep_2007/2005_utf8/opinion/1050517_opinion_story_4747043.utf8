 STING IN THE TAIL

 Colourful epithets provide good entertainment, but they are almost always the outcome of a situation far from entertaining. Leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party did not stop at ?obnoxious? and ?vindictive? in their description of the United Progressive Alliance government. But even these two adjectives are enough to show how they feel about the UPA government?s decision to reject the Phukan Commission report and hand over the investigation of the 15 defence deals of Tehelka fame to the Central Bureau of Investigation. Side by side, the sale of the two Centaur Hotels in Mumbai will also be investigated by the CBI, since the comptroller and auditor general?s report suggests irregularities in the form of extensions and deviations. The National Democratic Alliance has been touched in a sensitive spot ? Mr George Fernandes and Mr Arun Shourie are its pride. The UPA has rejected the Phukan Commission report as ?incomplete?, because it has ignored the term of reference that required it to inquire if ?illicit gains have been made by persons in public office, individuals and any other organization?. The BJP is naturally condemning this as motivated and harping on the idea of a ?witchhunt?, particularly because Mr Fernandes has been exonerated by the report. 

 The Centaur Hotels imbroglio is no less ugly. The role of Mr Arun Shourie in helping Mr Ajit Kerkar to buy the Juhu Centaur in Mumbai is being brought into question. But there is a larger question: did the BJP-led NDA, in its hurry to raise money through disinvestment, allow dubious goings-on? Clearly it is the pressure exerted by the left on the Congress that has made disinvestment into a high-profile debate topic. However, while irregularities should not be allowed to go unchecked, and deterrents are especially necessary in the highest levels of power, it is a pity that the UPA is also falling into the groove of discrediting its predecessor like every other government. There seems to be no escape from the politics of suspicion. Judging the rival is ultimately a sterile and demoralizing exercise, since it must detract from the business of governance. From what Mr Manmohan Singh had repeatedly said, such muck-raking is unprofitable, for his declared aim is consensual policy-formation. But coalition government has its own inescapable logic. Besides, the opposition?s determined boycott of parliament and sullen lack of decorum have not helped.

 DOUBLE DEAL

 Death may be a leveller but disease certainly is not. Not in India at least. It has taken a searing article by two Indian doctors in the British Medical Journal to broadcast this fact to the world. The fulsome praise of cheap, speedy and excellent medical care in India that has been pouring in from other countries in Asia as well as from the West has created an image of a healing heaven. The two doctors, outraged by the inequality built into the healthcare in the country, evidently felt the need to lay the truth bare before the world. The sudden popularity of India as a health destination is directly linked to the flourishing of the private healthcare system. India was never short of excellence and skill; it has always produced some of the best doctors in the world. Till recently, however, their chosen field has been overseas, with conditions and rewards that they found fitting. It is now possible to get it all in India, and build institutions of international standards. Inevitably, care in these institutions is expensive.

 But what the less privileged Indian cannot afford is reasonable, even cheap, for overseas patients. Much of the fuss abroad about the excellence of India?s healthcare has to do with that, and the fact that there are no queues. But the differences between private and public systems of healthcare would not have been so stark had the government been more attentive, in terms of budget allocation and policy, to the general health and medical treatment of its own people. The prevalence of malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases is a scandal. Common stomach ailments, like diarrhoea and gastro-enteritis, infectious diseases like tuberculosis, can all turn fatal. The campaign against polio alone has seen some success. But the other diseases should not be there at all, and certainly should not be killers. The situation in public hospitals is truly bleak in most parts of the country, lacking doctors, medicines and other essentials, even cleanliness and correct nutrition. The revenue brought into the country by the private health system is valuable, as is the image of India as the right place to go to in times of illness. But since the poor make up such a large percentage of India?s population, one of the priorities should be to ensure their good health. That is eminently possible, but it needs concern, planning and monitoring. Sustained action, not spurts of awareness programmes, is what is needed.

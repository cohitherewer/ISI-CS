 REAL MEN PROTECT THEIR WOMEN

 Violence against Indian women is sanctioned by social values that are endorsed by the police and the state, writes Uddalak Mukherjee

 Caring too much

 In early September, the Delhi police issued an advertisement in a national daily as part of its campaign against eve-teasing in the capital. It showed three men harassing a cowering young woman at a bus stop. The woman, who is seen attempting to keep her dupatta around her shoulders, has a look of utter helplessness on her face. The bus stop is far from deserted. There are four other men, and one woman, who are seen watching this spectacle in silence. Above the picture, written in bold black letters, are the following words; ?There are no men in this picture. Or this wouldn?t happen.? The purported message seems to be that a ?real man?, moved by the plight of the victim, would have come forward and freed her of her misery.

 The Delhi police may be of the view that such ?moving? images go a long way in curbing a malaise which is now fairly common in most Indian cities. But what is impossible to miss is the flawed reasoning that has gone into the making of this advertisement. This is all the more striking since the advertisement was released by the police, responsible for making the city safer for women. Incredibly, it contends that the responsibility of keeping women safe rests squarely on ?men?. 

 This conception is somewhat twisted and double-edged, apart from being derogatory to women. To say that men are the sole custodians of women?s safety only strengthens one of patriarchy?s most enduring myths; women, being the weaker of the two sexes, need to be looked after and cared for by their menfolk. The danger, however, lies elsewhere. Such an inviolable privilege also gives men the licence to repeatedly abuse the very responsibility that they have entrusted themselves with. It is well known that in India, violence against women is sanctioned and encouraged by deeply embedded values, carefully reared by a blatantly patriarchal society. In a country where a large number of women are raped, killed, and maimed by men who are intimate with, and trusted by, their victims ? husbands, lovers, friends and relatives ? the Delhi police?s call to men is likely to be met with a muted response. 

 Inexplicably, the advertisement only makes a passing reference to the role of the state in curbing violence against women. The good (male) citizen, the police argue, has two options while playing the role of the knight in shining armour. He should either ?intervene?, ?protect? and then ?escort? the victim from the scene of crime, or inform the nearest PCR van about the incident. The latter option, as everyone in Delhi knows, is untenable. 

 When a student from the North-east was being raped in a moving car by four men, repeated calls made to the police by her friend were of little help. The police reaction was tardy and they have only managed to nab one of the accused so far. Perhaps their repeated failures to make Delhi a safe city for women has goaded the police into admitting their failure and letting ?real men? take care of the worsening situation. But there can be no excuse for the invisibility of the state in a campaign against crime.

 But then, one should not be surprised with the Delhi police?s apathy when it comes to tackling crime against women. Some of its other initiatives to rid Delhi of molesters have been equally perfunctory, even comic. Take the set of instructions which were issued after a series of assaults on women recently. When in danger, women were advised by the police to scream at the top of their voice, or ask for help on their mobile phones, and even seek shelter in a house after stopping to check whether it is well lit or not. 

 Each suggestion is more absurd than the other. What if the victim is deaf and mute, like the minor girl who was raped by an acquaintance in a Delhi suburb last month? How does the police expect such women to scream when accosted? A large number of the victims in the city, as in other places, are extremely poor. A woman was kidnapped from south west Delhi and then raped once again in a moving vehicle when she had come out of her jhuggi to relieve herself in the early hours of the morning. For someone who could not even afford a roof above her head, the suggestion to buy a mobile phone for safety can only be made in jest.

 What is it like then for a woman to live and work in a city that has an abysmal record in ensuring the safety of women? Sipping tea in one of the dhabas that dot the Jawaharlal Nehru University campus, a female student from Nagaland says that survival for women in India?s capital is all about building one?s personal support system; friends, family, even instinct, rather than about faith in the state and its agencies. ?In an emergency, I would rather call up my roommate than a PCR van. Going to the police is like getting raped twice over.? 

 When she was asked what she meant, she came out with an even more disturbing, but widely-known, truth; a large section among the lawkeepers in Delhi, as in many other states in India, dub women from the North-east as an immoral, hence available, lot who deserve every bit of the harassment they get. The threats to women who have dared to speak up against the violence ? from celebrated writer-activists to poor tribals fighting the liquor mafias in many of the country?s villages ? is symptomatic of a culture that routinely resorts to the shaming of its more resolute women. 

 Violence against women need not always be physical. It is also aimed at stalling attempts at being self-sufficient. An old Jat lady, who runs a busy little tea shop near Karol Bagh, recounts how the shop-owners near her stall, all men, decided to boycott her tea and snacks in the beginning. Mausi, as she is called, sits on a rickety bench, almost as old as herself, and laughs when she says ?lekin meine himmat nahi chhori?. She didn?t shut her shop. Instead she decided to wait and serve other customers who were few and far between. Finally, the shopowners came around too, and now the same men swear by her chai and samosas. She believes that safety and indeed survival lie in creating little pockets of individual resistance in a space from which you are always being elbowed out.

 While travelling in Delhi, one often comes across a rather curious message pasted on a divider which splits the road into two lanes. It says, ?Stree ka samman, rashtra ka samman?. In a city which is often referred to as the ?rape capital of India?, the irony could not have been more telling. While the paradox may touch a nerve among the conscientious few, women like the tea vendor or the student from Nagaland would remain unfazed. Their years in Delhi have made them wise enough to ignore such token shows of care bestowed by the authorities.

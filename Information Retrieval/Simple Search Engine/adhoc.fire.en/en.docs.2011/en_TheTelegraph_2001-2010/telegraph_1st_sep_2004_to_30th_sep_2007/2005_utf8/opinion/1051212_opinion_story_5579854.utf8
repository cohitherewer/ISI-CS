 THE FINAL HOURS

 Gwynne Dyer

 They gave British playwright, Harold Pinter, the Nobel prize for literature, and the committee that awarded it made particular note of his life-long opposition to ?oppression?. So Pinter, 75 and ailing, sent his acceptance speech to Stockholm by pre-taped video link, and at its heart, as everybody expected, was yet another anti-American rant.

 It was probably Pinter?s last public attack on the United States of America, and it was to be savoured, in a perverse sort of way, because such performances, a staple of global political theatre for the past 50 years, are coming to an end. They were fuelled by impotent rage at the often selfish and sometimes brutal ways in which the US has wielded its power, but that, too, is coming to a end. 

 After some preliminary remarks about play-writing, Pinter?s acceptance speech attacked America not just for the invasion of Iraq, but for every sin it has committed since the second World War: ?The United State supported, and in many cases engendered, every right-wing military dictatorship in the world after the end of the Second World War...I refer to Indonesia, Greece, Uruguay, Brazil, Haiti, Turkey, the Philippines, Guatemala, El Salvador...Chile....Hundreds of thousands of deaths took place throughout these countries...and they are attributable to US foreign policy. But you wouldn?t know it.?

 Black and white

 You could make Pinter?s list of countries even longer, if you wished, but the striking thing about it is that over half the countries he names are in Latin America, although only a tenth of the world?s population lives in that region. In Latin America, its own ?backyard?, the US has usually behaved as an unapologetic imperial power, showing no more concern for local interests or desires than the traditional European empires did elsewhere .

 In other parts of the world, however, the US record is less dark, and the dark bits are more forgivable. American support was vital in shepherding defeated Japan and the shattered nations of western Europe into a prosperous and democratic future. America and the Soviet Union were the only two great powers that actively supported decolonization in Asia and Africa ? and although both had their strategic motives for doing so, they were also activated by genuine idealism. And it was the American strategy of ?containing? the Soviet Union but not seeking to destroy it that got the world safely through forty years of living on the brink of a nuclear war.

 Losing steam

 These are not small accomplishments, and most of the crimes that American foreign policy was responsible for during those years (apart from those in Latin America) were linked to the world-spanning confrontation with the Soviet Union. If you were to draw up a balance sheet of benevolent and useful policies versus selfish and destructive ones for Spain, France and Britain, the three nations that preceded America as the paramount global power over the past 350 years, they would all come out looking considerably less good than the US.

 And why are rants like Pinter?s about to go out of style? Because what fuels them is the sense of helplessness in the face of great power, and America?s power has gone into irreversible decline. It is only dwindling relative to the rapidly growing economies of China and India, but economic power is the foundation for all other forms of power, and ?relative? is the only word that counts in such calculations.

 The debacle in Iraq may ultimately hasten America?s dethronement, but the inexorable GDP numbers say that it was coming anyway within the next 20 or 30 years. And once the US is off the throne, people will simply lose interest in the knee-jerk, Pinteresque style of anti-Americanism.

 Portrait of an artiste Her evolution as a writer must be the end of one of the many journeys Geeta Chandran talks about in SO MANY JOURNEYS (Niyogi, $ 89.66). But in this book that she co-authors with her husband, Rajiv Chandran, the celebrity-dancer neither tries to impress the reader with her scholarly outpouring nor burden him with voluminous details about the dance form. She encourages one to approach it as a dancer?s album in which she jots down her personal reminiscences, her thoughts about her own work, her views on the necessity of innovation in Bharatanatyam, on the changed audience, on how dance is to be viewed. Her words flow as smoothly as her movements, but one is easily distracted by the vibrant pictures, both in colour and in black and white, of Chandran herself. But even picture albums have captions. Sadly, this doesn?t.

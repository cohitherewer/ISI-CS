 LEFT CONTROL

 Words are dangerous; blind allegiance to a political establishment even more so. Mr Pabitra Sarkar, an academic known for his pro-left credentials, has recently discovered this much to his own discomfort. The government has taken grave objection to certain examples given by Mr Sarkar in his primer on Bengali grammar. According to the government, these examples slight ministers, officials and teachers. This has earned for Mr Sarkar a stern reprimand from the state education minister. That Mr Sarkar has issued a prompt and unqualified apology, and has promised to have the book withdrawn will surprise nobody. Very few academics in West Bengal can afford to run foul of the left establishment in the state. But the incident has a significance going beyond Mr Sarkar?s solecisms and the education minister?s ire.

 The government and certain organizations controlled by the left have a stranglehold over the writing of textbooks in West Bengal. They may not directly sponsor the writing of textbooks but the books have to secure the stamp of their approval if they are to stand a chance of being recommended in schools. Thus, writers and publishers refuse to run the risk of alienating these bodies and the left establishment in any way. This is the context of Mr Sarkar?s immediate apology. In a situation where textbooks are chosen by schools on the basis of merit, the opinions of the education minister would not matter a tinker?s damn to an author. But this is not the situation that prevails in West Bengal. The examples that have caused offence to ministers, officials and teachers, in fact, reflect popular opinion about the laziness, inefficiency and corruption that have become the hallmark of these professions. Removing these examples from textbooks and an apology from an author will not eradicate these popular perceptions. Obviously, the left in West Bengal cannot bear too much reality. Hence, its propensity to control everything, including textbooks.

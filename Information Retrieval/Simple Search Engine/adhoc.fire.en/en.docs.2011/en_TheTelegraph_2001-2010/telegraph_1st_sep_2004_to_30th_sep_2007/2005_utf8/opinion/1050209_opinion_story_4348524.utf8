 Letters to Editor

 Unscientific theories

 Sir ? The views of teachers and educators in ?Fewer girls in science class? (Feb 2), seem vague at best. Armed with just a few examples ? a section of a computer-systems laboratory in an elite school or a computational physics class in another ? one cannot infer that ?young boys are more physical and seem more spatially aware... while girls are more social and learn language faster?. In Calcutta, girls are no less eager than boys to get admission to the science stream. The rising number of girls taking the IIT, BIT and JEE entrance examinations makes the point clearer. It is possible that in Washington, there are less opportunities for girls in the science stream, and more in the humanities. But the theory that girls are more social cannot be a reason for this. And what gives anyone the idea that if ?girls just wanna have fun?, it can?t be with numbers and test-tubes and chemicals?

 Yours faithfully, 

Debalina Haldar, Calcutta

 Irresponsible state

 Sir ? Does any citizen of India have any reason to believe that the law takes its own impartial course here (?Without a stain?, Feb 6)? The judiciary is increasingly becoming accessible only to those who can afford the cumulative costs of the legal process. Those who have the right political connections and muscle power even manage to get their cases disposed of fast. But then there are Malati Bauri and Avijit Sinha, whose cases represent merely the tip of the iceberg. Thousands of similar cases have not received any media attention. The efficiency of our legal system has declined so much that people would rather not go to the police or the court with their grievances. 

 In contrast, Islamic justice, of which we find evidence in the public execution of an Indian-born assassin in southern Saudi Arabia, seems to be much more effective and meaningful (?Man executed in Saudi?, Feb 6). There is little sense of purpose in our legal system, since the delays in the prosecution process, coupled with the irresponsibility and inefficiency at all levels, make a mockery of the most important pillar of a civilized society. The editorial is correct in thinking that the callous and incompetent officers responsible for ruining the lives of so many innocent people will never be identified, let alone punished, since we live in ?a state which is simply not accountable to its people?.

 Yours faithfully,

Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

 Sir ? The Malati Bauri case reminds me of the realization of a young deputy magistrate more than a hundred years ago. He recognized that the judiciary seeks proof, not the truth. And thus, law ?is nothing but a show business, and only the rich can afford to pay in order to enjoy it?. The name of the deputy magistrate: Bankim Chandra Chatterjee. 

 Yours faithfully,

Siddhartha Sen, Montreal

 Sir ? What will Malati Bauri do now that she has been finally acquitted after 15 years? Will the state rehabilitate her and find her employment? More important, will the state be responsible for the lost years of her youth?

 Yours faithfully,

Sudeshna Ghosh, Calcutta

 Trunk call

 Sir ? The editorial, ?Gift of cruelty (Feb 3), against the gifting of an elephant ? because of the cruelty involved in dispatch ? to Armenia by the prime minister reminds me of the story about the Siamese king?s gift of white elephants. It is said that the king of Siam, when he wanted to put an adversary in trouble, used to gift a white elephant to him. The maintenance of the animal was so expensive that it would drain the resources of the recipient. The use of ?white elephant? in current Indian politics and economics is well known. Incidentally, there is no evidence that white elephants exist.

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? The act of presenting Veda, a six-year-old baby elephant, to Armenia as a diplomatic gift, is a relic of royal times and does not go well in today?s world (?Jumbo trouble for Singh?, Feb 2). Animals are part of our natural surroundings and cannot be treated as commodities or gift items. If they fail to get acclimatized in an alien environment, they may die. Hindus, especially from southern India, have deep religious sentiments about elephants. By their nature, elephants live with immediate family members. If one gets separated, the rest of the family suffers great trauma. It is, therefore, not merely inhuman but also sadistic to separate a six-year-old baby from its family.

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

 Sir ? When the former president, K.R. Narayanan, gifted a baby female elephant to Turkey, Maneka Gandhi, the self-proclaimed messiah of animals in India, was Union minister. But elephants were probably at the bottom of her priority list, so she did not think it necessary to intervene in the presidential decision. Soon after the gift was made, there was an earthquake in Turkey.

 Yours faithfully,

Shiv Shanker Almal, Calcutta

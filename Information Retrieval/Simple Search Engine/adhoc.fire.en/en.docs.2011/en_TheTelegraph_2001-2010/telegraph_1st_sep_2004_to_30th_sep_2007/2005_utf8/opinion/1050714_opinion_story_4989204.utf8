 Letters to Editor

 Beginning of the end

 Sir ? The sacking of Narayan Rane, former chief minister of Maharashtra, from the Shiv Sena is just another example of one family, father-son duo in this case, calling the shots in a political party (?Sena in slanging match?, July12). Recently, in Tamil Nadu, we had the DMK chief, M. Karunanidhi, picking on the MDMK leader, Vaiko, who dared to criticize the growing clout of Karunanidhi?s son in the party. And now in Maharashtra, Rane has paid a heavy price for his differences with Bal Thackeray?s son, Uddhav. This only goes on to show that dynastic politics is very much integral to Indian politics, not just in the Congress, but in other political parties as well. 

 Yours faithfully,

R. Sekar, Angul

 Sir ? Narayan Rane was shown the door for his bitter relations with the party chief, Uddhav Thackeray. Our netas often treat political parties as family enterprises. This has ruined the system of governance in our country. Political parties that thrive on personality-cults, rather than on sound ideologies, are on the rise in India despite the fact that a two-party system is ideal for a democracy such as ours. We can put an end to this only by ensuring that one man is not vested with so much power as to enable him to make or break political parties in India. 

 Yours faithfully,

Subhash C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir ? The expulsion of Narayan Rane has dealt a body blow to the future prospects of the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra. In fact, it is yet another setback for the party after Chhagan Bhujbal left its ranks to join the Nationalist Congress Party in the early Nineties. It is doubtful whether the Sena will be able to recover from this loss, although Bal Thackeray seems confident about the party?s future. However, there can be no doubt about the fact that the senior Thackeray is giving more attention to his putra than to his party nowadays.

 Yours faithfully,

Subhasish Mohanty, Puri 

 Sir ? Political parties cannot be run as personal fiefdoms. This is not possible in a democracy. If a politician tries to do this, then that would surely ring the death knell for him and his party. This is exactly what has happened to the Sena in Maharashtra. Now with Thackeray at the end of his political career, the party?s fortunes have nosedived under his son. Rane?s dismissal and the resignations of a string of senior leaders prove that the party is a ship which is bound to sink sooner or later.

Yours faithfully, 

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur 

Sir ? With the dismissal of Narayan Rane, the number of those who have left the party, whose political future they were instrumental in shaping, has gone up. The consequences of passing the mantle to a bunch of inexperienced young leaders will prove to be costly for the Sena. Already, its influence is on the wane ? the Sena failed to win the last elections and bandhs called by sainiks now evoke a muted response. Rane?s leaving the party possibly marks the end of the road for the Sena and Bal Thackeray.

 Yours faithfully,

H. Parshuram, Mumbai

 Eyes wide open

 Sir ? The horrible blasts that killed many people in the London underground recently has jolted the Calcutta police into action. One can now see cops with sniffer dogs, checking bags and frisking passengers who are seen to loiter suspiciously in the railway stations. Unfortunately, our men in uniform are like carbonated drinks. After the bang, the fizz lasts only for a few seconds. Hopefully, the threat of a terror strike will ensure that the fizz lasts longer this time around.

 Yours faithfully,

Sandeep Sethi, Calcutta

 Sir ? The authorities have suddenly woken up to the fact that the Calcutta Metro railway is a sitting duck for a terrorist attack. So sleepy attendants manning exit points are now a thing of the past. They have now been replaced by alert cops with automatics, keeping a close watch on the crowd. 

 This has not gone down too well with the office-going crowd though. More adept at bending, rather than following, rules the new strictures are proving to be quite irksome to some Calcuttans. The other day, one heard a man comparing ?Calcutta?s pride? with the notorious Guantanamo Bay, what with all the frisking and security checks going on around him. While one does appreciate his wry sense of humour, one must admit that it is still better to have a safe ride home, even if it means that one has to travel under the watchful eyes of armed constables.

 Yours faithfully,

Bhaskar Dutta, Calcutta

 Letters to Editor

 Out of the cabinet

 Sir ? Everyone seems to have gathered by now that the best opening gambit with Mamata Banerjee is to offer her a cabinet berth (?Manmohan ?join us? invitation to Mamata?, Jan 13). The Trinamool Congress chief, who has of late been wielding the paintbrush and pen more often than facing the people, has no doubt been flattered by Manmohan Singh?s disarming confession that the Congress misses her. What she could not quite tell Singh, perhaps, was that she misses the Congress ? or rather, being in the Central cabinet ? even more. Remember how she did not mind being a minister without a portfolio in her second stint with the Vajpayee government? With the civic elections this year and assembly elections in 2006, and her party quite clueless about where it stands, the truth is that didi has no option but to put her easel and writing pad away and give Singh?s offer a good, hard thought.

 Yours faithfully,

Amar Ganguly, Calcutta

 Marooned and deserted

 Sir ? In the report, ?Islands shaken and forsaken? (Jan 5), your correspondent did not verify facts and went by the statement of a watchman. The Geological Survey of India does not have a permanent office in Port Blair. It is only a camp. The so-called ?GSI building? is, in fact, a property of the PWD and has been declared unsafe.

 The two officers, Tapan Ghosh and T.S. Giritharan, mentioned in the report, were there at the Andaman administration?s request to identify suitable construction material. They had neither the expertise nor the equipment for earthquake studies. As it was not possible for them to carry out their assignment in the post-quake situation, it was logical for them to close camp and return to the headquarters. GSI has already taken action for macro- and micro-seismic studies in the wake of the disaster.

 Yours faithfully,

Mangala Prasad, director-in-charge (IR and HR), Geological Survey of India, Calcutta

 Our correspondent replies: The report was written on the basis of what I saw. The facts were checked with the Andaman administration, local people familiar with the working of the GSI office there and elsewhere in the islands, sources in Mr Prasad?s own office, and, of course, with the watchman. Besides, why is it that in a highly seismic zone, GSI has only a camp in an ?unsafe? house and two officers with no quake expertise or equipment? It may not be irrelevant to recall here the comment made by the prime minister at the recent science congress: ?The question has been asked if we could have made better use of modern science and technology to alleviate, if not prevent, human suffering.? 

 Sir ? The report that the GSI office was shut down while repeated tremors shook the Andaman and Nicobar Islands shows that GSI officials have little concern for the well-being of Indians (?Tremor after tremor, but GSI door shut?, Jan 5). It was unkind of them to leave the tsunami victims in the lurch when they needed their help the most. But why should GSI officers bother after all? They have secure jobs and the guarantee of a pay-packet at the end of the month. They also probably have the assurance that they won?t be fired as the chief meteorologist in Thailand was, for negligence of duty. It is time that the government investigated the matter and brought to book negligent officials. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Anjan Chatterjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? While asking scientists to use their knowhow to forecast with greater accuracy tsunamis and earthquakes, the prime minister did not mention that there was a serious lapse in communication on the day the tsunami struck (?PM poser on tragedy to science?, Jan 4). One government department did send a message about the tsunami hitting Indonesia and the probability of the same happening in Indian coasts later in the day. Only, the message was sent to the former human resource development minister, Murli Manohar Joshi. Had it been sent to the proper ministry, with copies to the coastal state governments, perhaps the disaster could have been avoided to a large extent. It is a pity that such a grave lapse in communication has been allowed to pass. But are the scientists to be blamed for this too?

 Yours faithfully,

Pijush Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? The prime minister has reportedly urged scientists to invent advanced systems to warn before natural calamities strike, so that the loss of lives and property can be reduced. But from our experience of previous natural disasters, it is clear that the poorer sections suffer the most, while the affluent seem less vulnerable. Hence a simple measure could be to reduce or eliminate poverty. It is not the scientists, but economists like the prime minister himself, who should be devising poverty-reduction formulas. 

 Yours faithfully,

C.V. Krishnamoorthy, Calcutta

 Lost treasures

 Sir ? A rare bust of Buddha was stolen from the Victoria and Albert Museum in London the same day as the Indian Museum theft (?As in Calcutta, so in London?, Jan 5). It may be coincidence, but a link between the two should be investigated. The security at the V amp;A is expected to be better than the Calcutta museum?s, but that is no reason for the authorities in Calcutta to sit back and relax. Recent history tells us that investigations can carry on for ages, but the precious artefacts, which are part of the historical and cultural heritage of a nation, are lost forever. 

 Yours faithfully,

Rimli Datta, Calcutta

 Sir ? The police have made little headway on the Museum theft, just as they failed to catch the Nobel thief. No wonder people continue to be cynical about the force.

 Yours faithfully, 

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Errata

 The picture with Bharat Bhushan?s ?Don?t send the Nagas away empty-handed? (Jan 17), shows Indira Gandhi with Mizo, and not Naga, leaders. The error is regretted.

 HOPES AND FEARS

 Peace deals with militant groups are always a battle of attrition. The line between their successes and failures is thin and often indistinct. Events on two successive days in Manipur proved this once again. The killing of eleven soldiers by one of the state?s many rebel groups first came as yet another episode in the unending tragedy. A glimmer of hope followed the next day in the statement by the defence minister, Mr Pranab Mukherjee, that eight Manipuri rebel groups had offered to end the hostilities. Even if this is only a beginning, it should be a hopeful sign in a state that has not seen any peace initiative for a long time. It is important now for the Centre to work on the first signals. The success of the peace efforts with the smaller outfits is likely to have its impact on other groups. It can also pave the way for similar initiatives in neighbouring Assam and Tripura, where too the major rebel groups have so far refused to give peace a chance. New Delhi is expected to eventually involve the Manipur government in the peace process. But, local politics sometimes hinders, rather than helps, attempts at peace-making. 

 However, neither the Centre nor the state government can afford to be complacent. The Northeast has witnessed too many aborted peace moves. As the defence minister indicated, the first talks with the rebel groups have not yet led to any ceasefire agreements. Not just the killing of soldiers on the eve of his visit to Imphal, but other events too suggest that it would be premature to expect an early end to violence in Manipur. There are groups, such as the United National Liberation Front, which still pitch for a United Nations-monitored plebiscite in Manipur. And, the twists and turns of the Naga peace talks remain a constant source of tension in the Imphal valley. The army and other forces have, therefore, no choice but to carry on the anti-insurgency operations. It is crucial for the army, though, to make a distinction between militants and innocent civilians.

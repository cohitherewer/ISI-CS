 Are Indians too fat?

 - Indians now prefer to drive to the toilet: cardiologist Naresh Trehan 

 Mounting evidence suggests that indeed they are, report Pathik Guha and Prasun Chaudhuri

 It was a nightmare for Smita Bhargavas parents. The prospective groom for the 23-year-old Calcutta college student was coming from Mumbai to meet her, having approved of the passport-size photograph Smitas family had sent him. The problem was that the photograph concealed what real-life Smita couldnt ? a 102-cm waistline and 85-kilo weight for her 1.6 metre height. Smita was finally taken to the Cosmetic Surgery Clinic, where 10 litres of fat were removed from her body through liposuction ? removal of fat using a suction pump ? before the boy could meet her. But for the treatment, the engagement wouldnt have materialised. 

 Nitesh Khatpal (25) of Delhi remembers his childhood family vacations not by the sights he saw but by the food each place offered. Everytime they travelled to Mussoorie, Nitesh would look forward to a visit to the Kempty Falls ? not for the waterfall in the popular tourist spot, but for its bread pakodas. A food freak, he weighed 125 kg when he was only 18. Every time he asked a girl out, he was told to lose weight. And then, when he finally got a marriage proposal from a girl, it was from someone who was also obese. 

 Smita and Nitesh arent odd examples of marriage preferences in 21st-century India; rather, they represent a trend thats assuming serious proportions in its post-liberalisation era ? an obesity epidemic. 

 More and more surveys are revealing 

 its alarming spread. A study coordinated by the All India 

 Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) this year showed that 

 43 per cent of the 35,000 people surveyed in 10 industrial 

 cities ? including Bangalore, Coimbatore, Delhi and Dibrugarh 

 ? are overweight. The incidence of abdominal obesity for 

 men and women (waistline 90 cm and 85 cm, respectively) 

 is more than 30 per cent. Two years ago, when AIIMS studied 

 obesity trends in children from the high-income group in 

 Delhi, it found that 27 per cent of them were overweight 

 and seven per cent obese.

 APPLE 

 SHAPED: 

 Abdominal fat is highly active, releasing more 

 of the harmful chemicals associated with heart 

 diseases or diabetes. 

 PEAR 

 SHAPED:

 Fat stored in the lower body is less active; so 

 less harmful, but more difficult to lose than 

 abdominal fat through exercise. 

 Indians have a propensity to be apple shaped. 

 No surprise then that they are more predisposed 

 to heart disease and diabetes than Europeans and 

 Africans who tend to be pear shaped.

 Swaroopa Srinivas, chief nutritionist 

 at Bangalores Sagar Apollo Hospital, says the number 

 of obese patients seeking treatment at the centre has gone 

 up by 50 per cent in the last decade. Obesity is growing 

 and thriving in India, she observes. Concurs Nandini 

 Mundkur, chief of Bangalores Children Hospital, Two 

 years ago, I rarely saw an obese child in months, but these 

 days I see about three to four obese children every week. 

 Manoj Khanna, the cosmetic surgeon in Calcutta who treated Smita, has a similar story to tell. When he started liposuction about a decade ago he didnt even have one patient a month. Now, there are more than two a week, he says. Seven out of 10 patients are women. And a majority of those who come to me belong to the middle class. 

 The number of people joining weight-loss clinics is another indicator of the size of the problem. Rupam, centre manager of a Vandana Luthra Curls and Curves clinic in Delhi, says that five years ago, an average of 100 people visited the centre daily. These days, the number of people walking in is about 250 a day. 

 Obesity in India ? or elsewhere 

 in South Asia ? has a unique racial feature. Unlike people 

 in the West, South Asians have less muscle tissue in the 

 body. And they have a propensity to accumulate fat on the 

 abdomen, unlike Europeans who usually accumulate flab all 

 over their body, and Africans who tend to put on weight 

 on their buttocks. 

 Experts dealing with obesity in 

 India have realised one thing: Western standards for judging 

 it are ineffective. A back-of-the-envelope calculation often 

 involves what is known as the body mass index (BMI) ? a 

 persons weight (in kilograms) divided by his or her 

 height (in metres) squared. Someone who is 1.7 metres tall 

 and weighs 80 kg will have a BMI of 27.68 (80/1.7x1.7). 

 The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute in the US considers 

 the BMI range of 18.5-24.9 normal. Those belonging to the 

 25.0-29.9 range are overweight, and a BMI of 30 or more 

 makes someone obese. 

 Billion-dollar 

 pill

 Is there a cure for 

 obesity? Only if we learn to master an on-off 

 switch in our body. 

 The hormone ghrelin in the stomach tells the brain, 

 Its time to eat. Shutting off 

 its production will stop overeating. 

 Similarly, a hormone called PYY in the gut tells 

 the brain, I am full. Switching it 

 on will also mean you wont feel hungry. 

 Separate bands of researchers are after the magic 

 pill either to shut off ghrelin or to boost 

 PYY.

 The fact that Indians have a higher 

 fat/weight ratio convinced doctors here of the need to revise 

 the BMI ranges. Moreover, Indians are more prone to 

 weight-related disorders than people in many other parts 

 of the world, says V.K. Bahl, professor, cardiology, 

 at AIIMS. So, following a debate at a seminar in Hong Kong 

 in July 2002, the World Health Organisation revised the 

 BMI range from 25.0-29.9 to 23.0-26.9 for identifying overweight 

 people here. Accordingly, an Indian with a BMI of 27 or 

 above is considered obese. 

 One of the indicators of the Indians increasing weight is the focus on extra-large sizes in the apparel industry. The sales of XXL attires are up. Most of our customers are donning free-size churidars and elastic pajamas, trying to hide protruding tummies, notes Pallabi Basu, manager of the Calcutta branch of FabIndia. 

 In Mumbai, Pantaloons has already opened two stores especially for large people, and plans to open one in Calcutta next month. Pantaloons business development head Hemang Savla says the decision to set up Alls Store emerged out of customer feedback on the demand for double and triple XL garments in Pantaloons outlets. Within six to eight months, there will be a dozen stand-alone Alls Stores in the country. 

 Experts cite a host of reasons for Indians getting fatter: there is an unending list of new habits to be blamed. Dramatic changes in our foods are primarily responsible for the mess, comments Calcutta-based nutritionist Pranaty Nandy. Weve drifted quite far from our traditional diet which used to be well balanced. We eat much less home-made items these days. What the restaurants and fast food joints offer is loaded with fats and refined sugars. But fast food, argues psychiatrist Sameer Parikh of Max Health Care, New Delhi, has become a necessity in the fast life that people lead today.

 A busy work schedule, clearly, 

 affects ones health. Most of Srinivass patients 

 in Bangalore, for instance, are IT professionals. They 

 work long hours, eat at odd hours and complain that work 

 doesnt permit them any time for exercise, outdoor 

 activities or recreation, she observes. 

 Cardiologist Naresh Trehan, at the Escorts Heart Institute and Research Centre, New Delhi, aptly sums up the situation when he says, Indians now prefer to drive to the toilet. He notices what he calls a socio-psycho-economic factor at play. The economy of our country is stronger now, he says. Sociologically, we have an expression of success, while psychologically, we want to express love. Notes Trehan, Indians tend to show affection through food. The fact that dads and moms have more to spend these days means more indulgence in food. 

 Habits apart, are Indians genetically 

 predisposed to obesity too? Yes, says Arup Ratan Banerjee, 

 head, anthropology department, Calcutta University. He cites 

 the so-called starving gene theory to explain 

 the phenomenon. Because weve been underfed for 

 thousands of years, explains Banerjee, were 

 endowed with genes that help store fat so that we can withstand 

 famine. Though those conditions are no longer there, our 

 genes still are. 

 Obesity comes with related problems. 

 Fat requires a copious supply of blood which puts 

 a strain on the heart and blood vessels, explains 

 Sukumar Mukherjee of the Calcutta Medical Research Institute. 

 It often leads to high blood pressure and wear and 

 tear in bone joints, causing osteoarthritis. Fat cells 

 also secrete estrogen, which is linked to certain types 

 of cancer, including breast tumour in women. 

 Worldwide, researchers are also 

 delving deep into the link between obesity and type 2 (adult-onset) 

 diabetes. According to D. Prabhakaran, associate professor, 

 cardiology, AIIMS, abdominal fat in Indians is suspected 

 to resist the production of insulin, heightening the risk 

 of diabetes. In a study involving 212 people aged 30 years 

 and above, A.B. Das Chaudhuri, professor of anthropology 

 and human genetics at Calcutta University, found that 47 

 per cent of the abdominally obese people suffered from problems 

 such as diabetes and high blood pressure. 

 Easy to 

 gain, tough to lose

 Why do you put on 

 extra flab in no time, but dont shed it 

 so fast? Blame it on what else? 

 evolution. Millions of years before McDonalds 

 or KFCs or Pizza Huts made their billions, our 

 hunter-gatherer ancestors feasted on loads of 

 food whenever they got their hands on a huge kill. 

 The excess calories accumulated in fat cells which 

 swelled as much as six times their size. It was 

 a nice arrangement as the stored calories stood 

 them in good stead during famines when the stock 

 dissipated, and the cells got smaller again, slowly 

 . The system prevails you put on weight 

 at almost no cost, but get fleeced to become slim.

 The obesity epidemic in 

 Indian society is critically felt among the adolescents, 

 comments Vandana Luthra, proprietor of a chain of fitness 

 and slimming centres in the country. Launched 16 years ago, 

 her outfit has 84 centres in 46 cities now. Of late, it 

 has also started interactive sessions in some public schools 

 in Delhi to make parents aware of the impact of their childrens 

 eating habits. 

 Not everyone, however, is oblivious to the dangers ahead. And among those who glimpsed a new awareness was Pepsi Foods, which introduced Diet Pepsi to the Indian market five years ago. Abhiram Seth, executive director of the company, wont divulge figures, but says the market for the diet drink is small and primarily urban. But its a core consuming group which is calorie conscious, he says. 

 The soft drink market reveals the Indian mindset. Though the craving for a careless calorie intake ? reflected in the high sales of carbonated drinks ? is still enormous, the concern for the new epidemic ? shown in the demand for the diet brands ? is mounting. Waking up to the menace is a must, or else most Indians will soon become diabetics, hypertensives or patients of some form of cancer.

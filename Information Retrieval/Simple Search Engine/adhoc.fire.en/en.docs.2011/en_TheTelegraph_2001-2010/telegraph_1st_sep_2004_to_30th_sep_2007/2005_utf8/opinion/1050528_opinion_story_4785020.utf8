 Letters to Editor

 In the light of reason

 Sir ? Ophthalmologists are perhaps overreacting a bit when they fear that Naina, the film starring Urmila Matondkar, will hamper eye donation (?Naina under eye donation cloud?, May 20). There is neither love nor ghosts in real life. But for generations, people have enjoyed stories about both, knowing their ethereal quality. Indians are not na?ve or gullible enough to believe that ?the spirit of the person whose eyes the girl gets passes into her?. They can differentiate between reality and fantasy.

 Yours faithfully,

 Tapan Pal, Calcutta 

 A new beginning

 Sir ? The former Australian skipper, Greg Chappell, has been appointed the Indian cricket team?s coach for the next two years, notwithstanding his ordinary showing as the coach of South Australia. Chappell, who is known for his candid views and no-nonsense approach, is a professional of considerable repute. It will be interesting to see how the Indian cricketers, always ready to shy away from hard work, take to the new coach?s rigorous regime. 

 If Chappell has his say in team selection, he will surely raise a few points about the fitness levels of some players. For instance, Ashish Nehra and Zaheer Khan, who are often sidelined owing to injury. He might also object to players shooting for commercials, inaugurating events and writing columns during a series. Is this why the board gave him a two-year contract, instead of a five-year one? John Wright was a mild-mannered man who was shouted, and even sworn, at by some senior players during the later part of his tenure. But the same players might not be able to have their way with Chappell who is unlikely to put up with such insolent behaviour. 

 Yours faithfully,

Ganesh Sovani, Thane 

 Sir ? Given the media?s role in shaping public opinion, the extensive coverage given to Greg Chappell?s appointment will put on the poor man the burden of unrealistic expectations. There is no doubt that Chappell is the right man for the job. However, if the results take a while in coming, it might lead to public anger directed at the new coach, thanks to the media hype about the man.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Susobhan Sarkar, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The selection of Greg Chappell is the best thing to have happened to Indian cricket in a while, considering the string of poor performances by the team of late. Chappell?s experience will surely help him turn things around for the side. With due respect to Mohinder Amarnath, an Indian coach would have been more of a bane than a boon, given the laid-back attitude of most of them. Anshuman Gaekwad apart, none of our desi coaches has delivered. John Wright did a wonderful job but India?s recent performances suggested that a change was necessary. With Chappell?s appointment, Indian cricket is headed for better days.

 Yours faithfully,

Sumant Poddar, Calcutta 

 Sir ? If one were to go by media reports, Greg Chappell had impressed the six-member selection committee with his remarkable presentation. It now remains to be seen whether the board and the players can make the best use of this man. This former Australian great, once revered for his majestic pulls and silken drives, hates to lose. And Chappell?s credentials prove that he is the man who can make a difference. If the board provides him with proper support staff, and bowling and fielding coaches, he will certainly live up to his promise. The only thing that Chappell needs is more say in team selection, something which the Pakistan coach, Bob Woolmer, enjoys. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Dipro Ray, Calcutta

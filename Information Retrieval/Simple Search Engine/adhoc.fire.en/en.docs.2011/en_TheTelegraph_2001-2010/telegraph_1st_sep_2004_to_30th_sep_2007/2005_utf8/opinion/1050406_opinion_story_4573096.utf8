 Letters to Editor

 Join the gang

 Sir ? Arguably, Paul Wolfowitz may not be the best person to head the World Bank, but is there really any need to dig into his past and indulge in name-calling the way S. Venkitaramanan urges us to do (?Developing presidents?, April 4)? A similar effort with respect to many presidents and prime ministers of countries will prove that they too do not fit the bill. After initial doubts, the European Union has rallied around the American choice. India, too, needs to do a reality check in continuing with a hardline approach. In this unipolar world, the pragmatic approach would be to maintain a low profile on such contentious issues and extract the best mileage for the nation at a later date. And India surely needs generous World Bank inputs, notwithstanding its forex reserves. First and foremost is self-interest. Look at the way Pakistan has re-invented itself.

 Yours faithfully,

Sabyasachi Dutta, Mumbai

 Battling order

 Sir ? ?Ten reasons why Sourav should stay? (April 3) makes it appear as if Sourav Ganguly has been issued a show cause notice and The Telegraph had been authorized to reply on his behalf. None can match Ganguly?s contribution to the shaping of the present team. But aggressive captaincy is successful only if there are dedicated cricketers like Rahul Dravid in the playing eleven. Yet, while justifying Ganguly?s stature, The Telegraph has always tried to undermine Dravid?s stature. Did Dravid ever try to dislodge Ganguly? Dravid is not as flamboyant as Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, or Yuvraj Singh. He is a silent, committed performer. It is an altogether different matter how he would have performed had he been the captain. 

 However, Dravid is ageing and Ganguly has been found fumbling. It is time to hand over the captaincy to someone like Mohammed Kaif, who is both young and aggressive. And the earlier it is done, the better. 

 Yours faithfully,

Gautam Bardoloi, 

 Jamshedpur

 Sir ? Instead of berating Sourav Ganguly for each match that the team loses, we should give the Pakistan cricket team its due and applaud them. As for Ganguly, he is, most probably, going through a lean phase in his career. But there is no doubt that he has led the team well in the last five years.

 Yours faithfully,

Kundan Sundas, Darjeeling

 Sir ? In Bangalore, Pakistan handsomely levelled the test series. But blaming the whole Indian team for it would be unjustified. Almost each and every player in the team has contributed to the series, barring of course, the skipper. In the match in Bangalore, the team needed a good knock from him, but he scored 1 and 2 respectively. Sourav Ganguly, once known for his aggressive nature on the field, now scores like a tailender. If the Board of Control for Cricket in India wants to see India perform like Australia, it has to take hard decisions. The Australian board has dropped non-performers without qualms, be it Waugh brothers or Michael Bevan. 

 Yours faithfully,

Md Mudassir Alam, Aligarh

 Sir ? Team India?s capitulation to Pakistan on the final day of the Bangalore test was shocking. And Indian batsmen, especially Sourav Ganguly, should take the responsibility for this poor showing. Ganguly seems unable to break out of the jinx of the digits 1 and 2 ? his scores in the five innings were 21, 12, 12, 1 and 2. The Indian skipper started the series with a target of achieving an important milestone ? scoring 5,000 runs in test cricket ? for which he needed only 121 runs to be scored in 3 tests. He has failed to score even an average of 50. Whenever there is talk of dropping Ganguly, his followers put forward the example of Mike Brearley, under whose captaincy in the Eighties, England won most matches despite his own poor performance. But they forget that Brearley had a mercurial allrounder, Ian Botham, who used to be the match winner. No such player is available to India. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arun Chandra Kundu, 

 Narwapahar, Jharkhand

 Sir ? Cricket is a game of eleven, and no individual, players. Tennis would have been a better sport for Ganguly. Maybe, he should learn tennis and be the captain of the Indian Davis cup team as the ?non-playing? captain. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kunal Saha, Columbus, US

 Sir ? The question of dropping Sourav Ganguly does not arise. Just look at New Zealand?s recent performance against Australia. They have been beaten convincingly in both the one day internationals and tests. Their captain, Stephen Fleming, performed miserably in batting in almost all the games. But they are not thinking of changing their captain. 

 Yours faithfully,

Dilip Kumar Saha, Gurgaon

 Sir ? India?s run rate hovers around 4.4 when Sehwag is in the wicket, and drops to 2.2 immediately after he departs. Ganguly?s position at one down may help maintain the run rate. 

 Yours faithfully,

B.K. Chakrabarti, Ranchi

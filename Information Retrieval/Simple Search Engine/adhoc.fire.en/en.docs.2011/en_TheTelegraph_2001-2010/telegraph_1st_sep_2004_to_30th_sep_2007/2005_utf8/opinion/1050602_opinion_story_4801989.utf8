 Letters to Editor

 All that junk

 Sir ? The way the media have treated the story of the obese 11-month-old boy, Lokman Hakim ? while he was alive and even after his death ? is appalling. Now that Lokman has died under the most tragic circumstances, the search for a new and better Lokman is on every day. Reporters have been sent out to the districts to spot any obese children that they might find. And if there is a story of poverty and deprivation to go with them, nothing like it. The only sensible lines written about the whole episode were perhaps by Gouri Chatterjee in her ?Via media? column of May 26. But The Telegraph also made Lokman the peg of an article on the ill-effects of junk food among urban children. Nothing could be more unfair and off the mark. For children from Lokman?s background, few of whose parents manage to get them adequate nutrition, junk food is the least of the problems. 

 Yours faithfully,

 T.K. Bardhan, Calcutta

 Ifs and buts

 Sir ? Ramachandra Guha provides a fascinating ?what-if? glimpse into the history of Indian cricket in ?Virtual cricket? (May 28). However, what Guha thinks were Mushtaq Ali?s reasons for not touring Australia in 1947-48 does not tally with the legendary batsman?s own explanation in his autobiography, Cricket Delightful. According to this book, after being named vice-captain, Mushtaq Ali was forced to withdraw following the death of his elder brother, Iqbal Ali. There is no mention of any threat to his family as claimed by Guha. As for Mushtaq Ali then making himself available when ?things sort of settled down? following ?those horrible months before and after August 1947? (Guha?s own words), this is at variance again with Mushtaq?s own account. According to his autobiography, Mushtaq made himself available once the mourning period was over at the behest of his employer, the Prince of Holkar. However, the board declined to include him at that late stage as his replacement had already been named and the team was set to depart from Calcutta.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? A few of the situations imagined by Ramachandra Guha raise questions about the process of selection of Indian cricketers. Like most public institutions in India, the Board of Control for Cricket in India has had its share of individuals who had other interests than selecting the best cricketers to represent the country. The cricketing history of India could indeed have been different had the selection process been transparent.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The list of ?what-if?s of Indian cricket, though interesting, is not exhaustive. The answers to the questions raised are conjectures at best. True, the counter-factual school of history-writing is gaining currency, but a history can hardly be based entirely upon guesses.

 This reminds me of Albert Einstein, who too raised a number of ?what if? questions, such as, what if the earth were even a little bit nearer to or further away from the sun; what if the weight and mass of the earth were a little bit more or less than what they are; what if the distance of the moon from the earth was a little bit more or less than what it is; what if the weight and mass of the moon were even a little different than what they are; and so on. The answer to all these hypothetical questions is a single and definite one: there would not have been any life possible on earth. 

 Yours faithfully,

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Reading ?Virtual cricket? made me wonder what would have happened if Navjyot Singh Sidhu had not walked out on the team and Sanjay Manjrekar got himself injured during India?s 1996 tour of England. Sourav Ganguly had gone on the tour as a ?quota? player and the butt of pundits? jokes. He was not in the good books of the captain, Mohammed Azharuddin, or the manager, Sandip Patil, either. Sidhu?s walk-out and Manjrekar?s injury forced the team management to field Ganguly. And the rest is history.

 Yours faithfully,

Kajal Chatterjee, Calcutta

 Commercial use

 Sir ? During the last election campaign, the National Democratic Alliance was criticized for wasting public money in its series of ?India Shining? advertisements. The Congress made it a major issue in its bid to come back to power. But isn?t the present United Progressive Alliance government ? comprised mainly of the Congress ? guilty of committing the same offence? The government, and even individual ministries, are regularly publishing full-page ads of their ?achievements? in the past year. This also speaks volumes about how insecure the present government is. If it had so many success stories under its belt, would it need to bank on such commercials? But photos of ?visionary leaders? do not necessarily translate into votes. Which means the Congress would be better off working sincerely, rather than relying on publicity stunts. 

 Yours faithfully,

Isha Shah, Calcutta

 Sir ? A huge advertisement by the Delhi government was splashed across newspapers on the death anniversary of Jawaharlal Nehru. But why should a state government take out an advertisement on the death anniversary of a former prime minister (although there was no reference to this fact in the advertisement)? Will the Delhi government also take out similar advertisements on the birth and death anniversaries of all the other former prime ministers? If, however, the reason is that Nehru belonged to the Congress, the advertiser should be penalized for misusing public funds. 

 Yours faithfully,

S.C. Kapoor, Noida

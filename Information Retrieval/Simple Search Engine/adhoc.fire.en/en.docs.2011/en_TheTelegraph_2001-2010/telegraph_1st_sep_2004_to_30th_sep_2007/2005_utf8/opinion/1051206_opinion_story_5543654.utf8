 Letters to Editor

 Woman scorned

 Sir ? The treatment meted out to the most outspoken leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party, Uma Bharti, by the backroom managers of the party is shocking. The latter are clearly jealous of her popularity in Madhya Pradesh (?Second rung scuttles Uma comeback?, Nov 27). Bharti had a genuine claim to the chief ministership of the state, particularly since she was projected as the BJP?s chief ministerial candidate before the elections. Her services were also utilized extensively during the recent Bihar elections; so it seems that she is only required for the elections, not afterwards. The way the BJP has selected Shivraj Singh Chauhan has made its statements against the Congress, as lacking inner party democracy, absolutely hypocritical.

 Yours faithfully,

Biplab Chanda, Calcutta

 Sir ? The editorial, ?Party encounter? (Dec 1), is right in pointing out the ?uncertainty and factionalism? within the BJP, evident from the change of three chief ministers in two years in Madhya Pradesh. Those who demanded strong action against Uma Bharti failed to appreciate the huge mass base she had created. The Congress, and not the BJP, will reap rewards from her suspension 

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad

 Sir ? With Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L.K. Advani on the brink of retirement, a power struggle has started within the BJP. The party has many ?politicians? but very few ?leaders?. Pramod Mahajan, Arun Jaitley, Rajnath Singh, Sushma Swaraj, all have their limitations, and cannot slip into the shoes of Vajpayee or Advani. With the expulsion of Uma Bharti, the party has done itself more harm than good, because Bharti enjoyed the support of the general public as well as the hardcore Hindus. Bharti went to jail for the sake of her party, ignoring the lure of the chief minister?s chair, but the cruel game of politics finally caught up with her.

 Yours faithfully,

Abhinandan Mishra, Bhopal

 Sir ? Will Uma Bharti?s expulsion cure the BJP of its many ills? Several leaders shunted out by the BJP ? such as Subramaniam Swami, Shankersinh Vaghela, Madanlal Khurana ? have been politically alive and kicking. Bharti can, too. If she concentrates on consolidating the Hindu votes, she could well be the alternative to the BJP that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh is looking for.

 Yours faithfully,

Dhanakar Thakur, Ranchi

 Sir ? Uma Bharti, true to her irresponsible and irrepressible self, is leading the BJP again on a merry dance to achieve her selfish end. Are these the signs of a sanyasin? It is good that the BJP finally decided not to put up with Bharti?s antics any longer.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Kamat, Alto Porvorim, Goa 

 Sir ? Uma Bharti?s claim, ?I am the BJP? reminds us of Congress followers equating Indira Gandhi with India in the Seventies (?Defiant sadhvi hits the road?, Nov 30). Our leaders must realize that however great or powerful they may be, the country, its people and institutions still stand higher. A part cannot be equated with the whole.

 Yours faithfully,

S.C. Kapoor, Noida

 Sir ? The ultimate test of endurance for the BJP was Uma Bharti?s reaction on not getting the Madhya Pradesh chief minister?s post. The ransacking of the party office in New Delhi by her followers was captured by television cameras. Such indiscipline by top leaders creates a wrong impression about the party among its followers. The BJP high command now seems to have learnt from the adage, ?Spare the rod and spoil the child?.

 Yours faithfully,

R. Sekar, Angul, Orissa

 Sir ? The kind of revolt that Uma Bharti has staged within the BJP is the result of a total absence of democratic practices within our political parties. If it had been truly democratic, the BJP would have appointed a board of scrutinizers to conduct an election among the members of the Madhya Pradesh legislature to choose the successor to Babulal Gaur. The person getting the maximum number of votes would have to be unanimously accepted as the leader. As long as the group of leaders sitting in Delhi decides state leadership issues, these incidents will continue to occur, whether in the Congress or the BJP.

 Yours faithfully,

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? For the BJP, a bigger problem than Uma Bharti?s rebellion is the discontent among the Madhya Pradesh MLAs. It will have an adverse effect on the governance of the new ministry. Shivraj Singh Chauhan, the new chief minister, will never enjoy the full confidence of his own MLAs.

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir ? Swapan Dasgupta?s ?Not into the sunset? (Dec 2) reinforces my longstanding suspicion that either Uma Bharti did not take her party seriously, or it is the other way round. She may have got away with murder before, but this time, Bharti lost control over the situation, and more importantly, the public has lost faith in her. Her scramble to grab the post of the chief minister has exposed her greed for power. The country has no need of politicians like her. She has much to learn from members of her sorority, such as J. Jayalalithaa, Sushma Swaraj and Vasundhara Raje.

 Yours faithfully,

Amit V. Sengupta, Calcutta

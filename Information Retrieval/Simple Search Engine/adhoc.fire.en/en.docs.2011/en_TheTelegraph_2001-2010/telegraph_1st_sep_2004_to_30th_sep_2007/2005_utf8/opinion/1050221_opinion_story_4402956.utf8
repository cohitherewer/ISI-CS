 FOR THE LOVE OF NEIGHBOURS 

The foreign secretary?s recent speech has sparked off 

a debate on inter-state relations in south Asia, writes Deb Mukharji

 Shyam Saran with foreign secretaries of 

Saarc countries, Islamabad, July 2004 

In a statement last week, the foreign secretary, Shyam 

Saran, laid out the government of India?s perspectives on relations with neighbours 

and its approach to the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. The 

statement is remarkable for its clarity and the unusual public candour. It has 

to be seen in the context of India?s declining to participate in the Saarc summit 

in Dhaka for reasons of the internal security situation in Bangladesh and the 

dismissal of any vestige of the democratic process in Nepal. There was criticism 

of the Indian action in the countries concerned as also within India for what 

was considered a blow to the Saarc process. It was obviously felt necessary to 

articulate Indian policies, concerns and vision in a broad framework, which the 

foreign secretary?s statement sought to do and which must be taken to be the considered 

policy of the government.

Our analytical approach to external relations, particularly 

with neighbours, being largely confined to political parameters, the wide range 

of the foreign secretary?s articulation may have occasionally escaped attention. 

Saran acknowledged that a productive neighbourhood policy was important for India 

in terms of international credibility. Domestic concerns intersected external 

relations at the borders of neighbouring states. As evinced elsewhere, there was 

emergence of sub-nationalism and ethnic exclusivity in south Asia, including India, 

and this was a matter of concern. India could not remain indifferent to issues 

of vital concern such as terrorism, insurgency or hostile propaganda. India would 

deal with any government, even though its own sympathies lay with democracy. 

Saran observed that south Asia was a compact unit 

with a history of close economic links, including the movement of people and goods. 

These links should be revived, and India would be willing, on its part, to offer 

necessary facilities. 

The history of Saarc showed that in the past 20 years 

it had been largely a consultative body with no collaborative effort. There had 

been a consistent effort by some countries in Saarc to counterbalance India and 

try and treat the organization as a mechanism for settling disputes. 

Unlike the European Union or the Association of Southeast 

Asian Nations, Saarc had no common perception of a security threat, and such a 

threat was made to emanate from India. Putting his views trenchantly, Saran said 

that it was not clear if the countries wanted to promote security and development 

in cooperation with, or hostility towards, India. India obviously could not accept 

or encourage any moves that sought to diminish its freedom of action.

Pointing out the substantial mutual gains that had 

been made in India?s relations with some neighbours, the foreign secretary acknowledged 

that as a larger country, India had greater responsibilities. India had the fullest 

confidence in her economic performance and would want to make the other countries 

stakeholders in her development. It was necessary to ?promote cross-border links, 

build upon intra-regional economic complementarities, acknowledging obvious cultural 

affinities?. What was required was a vision of a free market in south Asia, of 

shared interests and responsibilities, and a compact for a common pursuit of collective 

prosperity.

There may be nothing entirely novel in the views expressed 

by the foreign secretary which, in sum, or parts, have been heard over the years 

from Indian commentators. What has caused comment, or concern, is the fact of 

such almost-blunt enunciation of an Indian official point of view. The statement 

does indeed mark a departure from the anodyne expressions of all-embracing official 

goodwill. What needs to be noted is that in the sum of his remarks, the foreign 

secretary, in fact, showed greater respect for the sovereign and equal status 

of India?s neighbours by seeking a partnership that acknowledges the interests 

of all, including India?s, than the patronizing expressions of goodwill that puts 

some special onus of disbursing favours on India.

The Indian view of relations with neighbours has at 

one extreme the almost neo-con pro-activism believing that developments in the 

neighbourhood considered undesirable by India or inimical to it, can be altered 

by active interference. Such a view, fortunately held by very few, perhaps taking 

its cue from the Hobbesian arrogance of contemporary Washington, does not take 

into account the pitfalls of pursuing any such policy and the limitations on the 

power of the Indian state. 

And where the state concerned may be manifestly acting 

against the interests of its own citizens, the primary responsibility for change 

has to lie with its own citizens. At the other extreme is the view, held by many, 

that India could win neighbourhood confidence by the pursuit of I.K. Gujral?s 

doctrine, itself variously understood. But the pursuit of any doctrine is not 

for its own sake or for winning popularity, but ultimately for the promotion of 

the well-being of the citizens of the state. It is also true that India?s well-being 

cannot be seen in isolation from the well-being of its neighbours. One also must 

recall that though Gujral did pursue a policy of active co-operation with India?s 

neighbours, he had occasion to say that there would be no compromise with any 

actions by any state that could be seen to be active against India?s security 

interests or against the fabric of the Indian state.

The articulation last week does not seek to absolve 

India of making the extra effort to promote harmony and co-operation in south 

Asia. Indian policies have to be seen to be fair, to which one may add, they have 

to be fair-plus towards neighbours.

What remains regrettably true is that the Indian government?s 

attention span for neighbours has been, to say the least, sporadic in nature. 

It is true that there have been frustrations arising out of what is seen as shifting 

of goalposts or cherry-picking from understandings arrived at. But that does not 

absolve India of the responsibility to remain engaged. This periodic indifference 

has not contributed to the building of lasting confidence. If one were to accept 

that India?s policies and actions were always intended to be beneficial to all, 

then perhaps some introspection is required as to the reasons why their public 

projection has been deficient.

Of the two factors that impact on relations with neighbours, 

one is the approach of ministries other than external affairs, most notably home 

and commerce. There would always be need for coordination if the signals from 

Delhi are not seen to be mixed. The other relates to the concerns of the Indian 

states bordering the countries in the neighbourhood. The policy of the government 

of India must always take these into account for foreign policy is not fashioned 

in a vacuum but is intended to primarily serve citizens.

There is, of course, fortunately, life and activity 

beyond government policies and media analyses. A great deal of interaction is 

taking place among peoples at various levels including commerce, culture and tourism. 

These should be allowed to flourish without, at the least, hindrance from governments.

The debate on Saran?s speech at the India International 

Centre will continue for a while and is an opportunity for India, and perhaps 

her neighbours, to attempt a fresh look at inter-state relations in south Asia. 

Geography shall always keep us together and none of us can set sail for more conducive 

climes. The interests of our peoples demand greater mutual understanding and cooperation.

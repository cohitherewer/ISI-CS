 FOR RESPONSIBLE GOVERNANCE

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the Human Development Report 2005

 This report is about the scale of the challenge facing the world at the start of the 10-year countdown to 2015. Its focus is on what governments in rich countries can do to keep their side of the global partnership bargain. This does not imply that governments in developing countries have no responsibility. On the contrary, they have primary responsibility. 

 No amount of international cooperation can compensate for the actions of governments that fail to prioritize human development, to respect human rights, to tackle inequality or to root out corruption. But without a renewed commitment to cooperation backed by practical action, the millennium development goals will be missed ? and the Millennium Declaration will go down in history as just one more empty promise.

 We focus on three pillars of cooperation, each in urgent need of renovation. The first pillar is development assistance. International aid is a key investment in human development. Returns to that investment can be measured in the human potential unleashed by averting avoidable sickness and deaths, educating all children, overcoming gender equalities and creating the conditions for sustained economic growth. 

 Development assistance suffers from two problems: chronic underfinancing and poor quality. There have been improvements on both fronts. But much remains to be done to close the MDG financing gaps and improve value for money.

 The second pillar is international trade. Under the right conditions trade can be a powerful catalyst for human development. The Doha ?Development Round? of World Trade Organization talks, launched in 2001, provided rich country governments with an opportunity to create those conditions. 

 Four years on, nothing of substance has been achieved. Rich country trade policies continue to deny poor countries and poor people a fair share of global prosperity....More than aid, trade has the potential to increase the share of the world?s poorest countries and people in global prosperity. Limiting that potential through unfair trade policies is inconsistent with a commitment to the MDGs. More than that, it is unjust and hypocritical.

 The third pillar is security. Violent conflict blights the lives of hundreds of millions of people. It is a source of systematic violations of human rights and a barrier to progress towards the MDGs. 

 The nature of conflict has changed, and new threats to collective security have emerged. In an increasingly inter-connected world the threats posed by a failure to prevent conflict, or to seize opportunities for peace, inevitably cross national borders. More effective international cooperation could help remove the barrier to MDG progress created by violent conflict, creating the conditions for accelerated human development and real security.

 The renovation needs to take place simultaneously on each pillar of international cooperation. Failure in any one area will undermine the foundations of future progress. More effective rules in international trade will count for little in countries where violent conflict blocks opportunities to participate in trade. Increased aid without fairer trade rules will deliver sub-optimal results. And peace without the prospects for improved human welfare and poverty reduction that can be provided through aid and trade will remain fragile.

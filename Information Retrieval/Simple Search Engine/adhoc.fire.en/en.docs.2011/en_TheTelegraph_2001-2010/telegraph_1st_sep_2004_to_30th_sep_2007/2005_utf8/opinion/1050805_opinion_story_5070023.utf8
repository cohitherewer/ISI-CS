 THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY

 Wanna learn?

 Lost for Words: The Mangling and Manipulating of the English Language 

 By John Humphrys, 

 Hodder, pound; 5

 This book, by a former journalist, grows out of two fundamental worries. One is the way English is being mangled. And the other is the way English is manipulated by people trying to sell things ? bankers, advertisers and even politicians. This, however, is not a book about style. It is a book about clarity in writing.

 Those who pepper their sentences with like (as in ?I?m like with my publisher?) or use a totally redundant with (as in ?I will meet with you? or ?I will talk with you?). In the latter example, there exists no reason to substitute the perfectly acceptable ?to? by ?with?) might well wonder at the emphasis on clarity. The answer was given by George Orwell many years ago when he said that slovenly language ?makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts?.

 Humphrys goes about his business of pointing out some of the pitfalls involved in writing clearly with great humour. He begins by making a classification of the people who use English: (1) The Slobs: they do not care about the way language is used. They are the users of words like dunnit, innit and so on. (2) The Yobs: worse than the slobs because they pretend not to care about language but they do. They choose to use it badly. They are the ones who pioneered the use of like anywhere in a sentence. (3) The Nobs: they hanker for the days when your station in life was defined by how you spoke. They try all the time to speak like the Queen. (4) The Snobs: they want to sound clever. They attempt, never try; they request, never ask; they are prevented, never stopped. (5) The Pedants: they are the stickler for rules even if the rules make a sentence ugly and convoluted. (7) The Doubters: they believe in good English but are unsure of themselves and find rules a bit offputting.

 The category one falls into depends, according to Humphrys, on whether you were taught by Ms Smythe or Ms Smith. The former in tweed skirts taught the rules of grammar and the chances are that she produced the pedants. Ms Smith in short skirts and crop tops did not teach. She created enthusiasm and encouraged the kids (not students) to be creative with words. Those who came under her influence retain their love for language and do not mind the occasional solecism. The tension between the methods of Ms Smythe and Ms Smith is the one between discipline and complete freedom. Good writers of English know how to blend the two.

 One of the worst offenders, the author points out, are academics who try and uphold political correctness. He cites Sandra Harding of the University of Delaware who not only described Isaac Newton?s Principia Mathematica as a ?rape manual? but also called E=mc2 a ?sexed equation?. Humphrys recommends a strong sense of irony to read such stuff.

 Humphrys?s great strength is that he never overstates his case even while voicing his concern about the way English is mangled and manipulated. His examples are invariably delightful. If you care for good writing, this is a book worth having.

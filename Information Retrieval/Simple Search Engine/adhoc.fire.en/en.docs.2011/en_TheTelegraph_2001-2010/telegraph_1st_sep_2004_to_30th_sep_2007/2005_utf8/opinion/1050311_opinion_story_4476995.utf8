 CRACKS ON THE WALL

 Fractured lives

Class, caste, gender 

Edited by Manoranjan Mohanty, 

Sage, Rs 650

Contemporary Indian society is characterized by a 

growing democratic consciousness which is challenging the hegemony of economic 

forces, patriarchy and Brahminism. The editor, Manoranjan Mohanty, has put together 

contributions of scholars who are actively engaged with social and political discourses 

in modern India in this engaging collection. The three broad themes in this book 

pertain to the notions of class, caste and gender inequality.

 Anand Chakravarty, in his essay, analyses the agrarian class structure in Bihar, which remains divided on caste lines. The higher castes have access to material and political resources which helps them dominate the other groups. Lower-ranking castes are subject to both caste and class exploitation and form the landless agricultural sections. 

 The other essayists in this volume include Prabhat Patnaik, C. P. Chandrasekhar and Jayati Ghosh who have studied the reactions of Indian capitalists to neo-liberal economic reforms. They find it interesting that Indian capital, which was obviously a beneficiary of the license-permit raj, went along with economic liberalization. According to the authors, one reason for the change of perception among Indian capitalists was the sluggish growth of the domestic market after the mid-Sixties. Indian capitalists wanted to break into export markets, while the prospects of export remained bleak, and collaboration with metropolitan capital remained a soft option.

 The book also contains an article by M. N. Srinivas who writes that domination on caste lines increased after independence. The provision of constitutional safeguards to the backward sections of the population gave a new lease of life to caste formations, says Srinivas. In a similar vein, Rajni Kothari argues that the essential challenge of modernity lies not in the destruction of tradition but in the traditionalization of modernity itself. In the context of caste and politics, this means that secular elements in the caste system would be strengthened at the expense of obscurantism, while the new dimensions of a secular, demo cratic body politic would themselves become enduring parts of India?s value system. Kancha Ilaiah perceives the problem from another angle. He feels that unless the history of anti-caste movements is written by the organic intelligentsia of a given movement, such a history would not be able to do justice to subaltern voices. 

 While addressing the issue of gender inequality, Uma Chakravarti argues that discrimination on the basis of caste and gender were the organizing principles of the Brahminical social order. Neera Desai and Maithreyi Krishnaraj point out that the emergence of a women?s movement against patriarchal exploitation and inequality augurs well for the future of Indian women. Ilina Sen, however, cautions that the Indian women?s movement has an elitist character unlike the Chipko or anti-price movements which were mass-based. Jean Dr?ze and Amartya Sen, in their essay, explain India?s poor sex ratio on the persisting inequities between men and women in the country.

 The essays in this book deal with a wide range of issues ? rural and urban power structures, as well as the exploitation of oppressed social classes. In the process, the noted contributors have provided useful insights about new developments in the social, political and economic sectors in post-independent India.

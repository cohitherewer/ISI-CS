 TEAM IRAN 

 - A change in Iranian diplomacy influenced India?s vote in Vienna

 DIPLOMACY / K.P. NAYAR

 Iran?s ambassador to the IAEA, Ali Asghar Soltanieh: false notes 

 There are moments in the history of every nation?s foreign policy and diplomacy when its leadership has to decide whether to stand up and be counted or allow itself to be stranded by a receding tide of history. The vote that India?s permanent representative to the UN offices in Vienna, Sheel Kant Sharma, cast on September 24 in the International Atomic Energy Agency on the express instructions of the foreign secretary, Shyam Saran, after it was cleared by the prime minister, was one such occasion. 

 What is unpalatable about the opposition by the left to that vote ? specifically Prakash Karat?s articulation of that opposition ? is that it is long on protecting Iran?s interests but woefully short where India?s stakes are concerned. The irony in this is that India and its foreign policy need the support and comprehension of the left during one of its critical phases of transformation to fit into the post-Cold War world: Tehran can do very well without such support from Gopalan Bhawan, the central office of the CPI(M).

 Indeed, the Islamic Republic of Iran has protected its national inte-rests very well for 26 years without the goodwill of India?s communists ? or, for that matter, their Iranian counterpart, the Tudeh Party. The fall of the Shah of Iran in 1979 was caused by a revolution that ranks, in terms of popular endorsement and participation, along with the October revolution which overthrew the Czars in Russia. Iran?s Islamic revolution has been the most successful upsurge by any people since Fulgencio Batista was sent packing by Fidel Castro 46 years ago. The state that was created by Ayatollah Khomeini and the institutions that he left behind in Iran have stood up to the West ? the US, in particular ? in spite of the communists, not because of them. 

 Iran would not have been where it is today within the IAEA if its new president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, had not overhauled Tehran?s nuclear negotiating team less than three weeks before the crucial vote in Vienna. In every country, new presidents or prime ministers, even elected ones, bring in people they trust into positions of importance and make changes. Rajiv Gandhi did it, so did Bill Clinton, and they both paid for it: Clinton quickly realized his mistakes, controlled the damage, regained his political initiative and won a second term in office.

 In the run-up to the meeting of the IAEA?s board of governors, Ahmadinejad replaced the chief of his supreme national security council by bringing in a known hardliner, Ali Larijani, who, in turn, made sweeping changes to the team which had long experience in keeping the West at bay on Iran?s nuclear policy. Out went Hossein Moussavian, Iran?s top nuclear negotiator, and another key diplomat with long experience in talks with the West, Sirous Nasseri. 

 It was this new team which went with Ahmadinejad to the UN summit in New York, where his speech on Iran?s nuclear policy neatly played into the hands of the US president, George W. Bush. Before Ahmadinejad?s speech at the UN, Condoleezza Rice, the US secretary of state, was publicly requesting India, Russia and China, to talk to Iran and find a way to deal with its nuclear policy, in ways similar to the six-party negotiations with North Korea which have defused the nuclear shadow over the Korean peninsula for the time being. But after Ahmadinejad?s hardline speech in New York, Bush and Rice did not need India, Russia or China to negotiate with Iran. The stage was set for the showdown in Vienna.

 Iran?s nuclear programme was not started by Khomeini, but by the late Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. It was a joint venture between Pakistan?s Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and the Shah, a by-product of the Shah?s megalomania and Bhutto?s burning desire to get back at India for his country?s humiliation over the creation of Bangladesh. After the Islamic revolution, Khomeini called upon the Persian diaspora to return home and contribute to a new Iran. Western propaganda and prejudices against Iran?s Islamic regime have obscured the reality that large numbers of highly qualified professionals from many walks of life returned from America and Europe in response to that call. During visits to Iran, this columnist has met scores of such Iranians ? technically foreign nationals from having lived long years abroad and acquired the citizenship of their countries of residence ? who have found fulfilment from returning home and working in Iran, even under difficult conditions created by domestic political and theocratic turmoil and the havoc caused by a war imposed on the young republic by Iraq?s Saddam Hussein.

 One of those highly qualified overseas Iranians who heeded Khomeini?s call to return home was Reza Amrollahi. This columnist had a rare meeting with Amrollahi some 10 years ago. Amrollahi, who had the rank of Iran?s vice-president, was then heading the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran. The meeting took place at the organization?s heavily-guarded and secure headquarters. Amrollahi studied nuclear physics at the University of Texas and lived in the US for several years. He later moved to Belgium, where he worked at a nuclear facility before heeding Khomeini?s call to return to Iran. 

 What this columnist remembers most of all from the hour or so spent talking to the then AEOI chief is his obsession with ensuring that his country?s nuclear programme and policies do not give any quarter to the US to be used against Iran. At the time of this meeting, tension was high between Iran and Bahrain, on the one hand, and between Iran and the United Arab Emirates, on the other. Iran considers Bahrain to be its 14th province because of a decree by its parliament that was adopted not during Khomeini?s rule, but much earlier, in 1957. The Iranians also claim three Gulf islands, a claim that is contested by the UAE and often leads to tension between the two countries. 

 Amrollahi was convinced that the US would use any excuse to plot against Iran, destabilize the Islamic republic and, if an occasion arose, invade the country. A part of his mission, as the man in charge of fashioning Iran?s nuclear policy, was to make sure that Washington was frustrated in this objective. Iran?s one-time oil minister, Gholamreza Aghazadeh, who replaced Amrollahi, showed the same determination. Ahmadinejad broke that unstated underpinning of Iran?s nuclear diplomacy and his new team lacked the finesse and tact that enabled Tehran to have room for manoeuvre at the IAEA and in the UN for at least 10 years.

 This change in Iranian diplomacy was an important factor that influenced the Indian vote in Vienna on September 24. The Islamic revolution has changed Iran?s political character, but it has not and will not alter the character of the Iranian nation or its people. If history is any guide, Iranian diplomacy will correct itself and go back to what Ahmadinejad?s two predecessors, Mohammad Khatami and Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, practised on the nuclear front. It is an opportunity that the Bush administration would very much like to deny Ahmadinejad. But in Tehran, the process has already begun in the Majlis, where critics have been vocal this week about the diplomatic mismanagement in New York and Vienna. 

 New Delhi has always walked a tightrope on Iran?s nuclear ambitions. In 1990, the V.P. Singh government offered Iran a 5mw nuclear reactor, which Iran had sought for research purposes. A composite team from Tehran, made up of officials from the foreign ministry and the AEOI, led by a deputy minister, arrived in New Delhi for talks. The IAEA?s guidelines allowed such transfers to countries like Iran, which had signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Yet when the team went to South Block for talks, the V.P. Singh government reneged on its commitment to sell the research reactor.

 The CPI(M) and other left parties, which were supporting the government of that time, did not make an issue of such backsliding by the government the way they are doing now. At any rate, they did not change V.P. Singh?s mind or even that of the then external affairs minister, I.K. Gujral. Karat, however, now insists that Manmohan Singh should change his stand in November when the IAEA will once again be seized of the Iranian nuclear programme.

 IT?S AN UNEQUAL WORLD

 The United Nations may have got its way over Darfur, but the US continues to thumb its nose at the ICC, writes Sankar Sen

 Might is right 

 According to reports in the Sudanese media, on June 15, a court in the city of El Fasher in Darfur started public trial hearings of 160 suspects. This is Sudan?s legal response after the security council, acting on a recommendation by a United Nations commission, referred the heinous crimes of ethnic cleansing in Darfur, which claimed thousands of lives and rendered millions homeless, to the International Criminal Court. This was for the first time that the security council had referred a case to the court. Eleven countries voted in favour of the proposal in the security council, while four abstained, including the United States of America, which had earlier threatened to veto the resolution. 

 The ICC is a permanent tribunal to try individuals responsible for heinous international crimes. One hundred and sixty countries attended a UN-sponsored conference in Rome in 1998 to draft a treaty to set up the ICC. Of them, 120 nations voted to adopt the treaty, while 7 voted against (including China, Israel, Iraq and the US) and 21 abstained. At present, 90 countries, including all the world?s major democracies have ratified the treaty, but not the US. And this where the problem lies.

 The ICC is envisaged as a global judicial institution with international jurisdiction, complementing national judicial systems. There are three ways in which the ICC can launch an investigation. A country where the crimes took place can ask the ICC to look into the matter. The court?s chief prosecutor can take an initiative so long as the alleged crimes took place in one of the 98 countries which have signed and ratified the treaty that created the court. The security council can make a referral regardless of where the crime took place.

 Sudan has not ratified the treaty, and so is not a member of the ICC. It has thus challenged the legality of the ICC?s intrusion on the grounds that the ICC?s statute allows it to pursue cases where the host country is neither able nor willing to do so. Thus, it has taken measures to try and punish the guilty in Darfur itself. It has also arrested a few suspects. However, in view of the support the killers received from Sudan?s army and air force, it is doubtful whether the investigations and trials staged by Khartoum will be fair. 

 In return for allowing the security council to refer Sudan?s case to the ICC, the US has won the right for all states that have not joined the court to retain ?exclusive jurisdiction? over any of their own nationals who might be accused of any crime in Sudan. Neither the ICC nor any other foreign court will have the right to investigate, prosecute or try them.

 This brings to the fore the US?s determined opposition to the ICC and the reasons behind it. The crux of the US?s concern relates to the prospect that the ICC may exercise its jurisdiction to conduct politically-motivated investigation and prosecution of US officials. The American opposition to the ICC is in sharp contrast to the strong support given to it by the US?s major democratic allies. 

 Incidentally, the US itself played a major role in the creation of the ICC, especially in the drafting of the Rome statute. Bill Clinton signed the Rome statute on December 30, 2000, the last day the treaty was open for signature. But the Bush administration sought to nullify this by writing to the UN secretary-general, expressing its intention not to be bound by the treaty.

 The Bush administration is now negotiating bilateral impunity agreements with several countries. The goal of these agreements is to exempt US civilians and military personnel from the jurisdiction of the ICC. The US argues that such agreements are being contemplated under article 98(2) of the Rome statute. So far 82 countries have signed such pacts, including 34 ICC members states. But the EU countries, Canada, Argentina, South Africa and others have refused, saying that to do so would be to undermine the Rome statute. 

 Article 98(2), which says that the ICC may not proceed with a request for surrender of suspects that would require the requested state to go against its obligations under other international agreements, was included in the Rome statute to bring order to the handling of suspects by nations cooperating with the court. It was not meant to allow a state, which has refused to cooperate with the court, to negotiate agreements that secure exemption for its citizens or otherwise undermine the effective functioning of the court.

 The Rome statute grants the ICC jurisdiction over genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity if they occur within the territory of its state parties or are committed by nationals of the latter. While the statute allows the state party to conduct its own investigation and prosecution, the court still holds the authority to investigate or prosecute if the state party is unwilling to do so. 

 When the Bush administration could not obtain an exemption from ICC jurisdiction for its officials and personnel involved in UN missions, it vetoed the extension of the Bosnian peacekeeping mission on June 30, 2002. After a long debate, the security council conceded to the US demand and adopted a resolution which provides personnel and officials from non-ICC member states participating in US-authored missions with a one-year exemption from ICC jurisdiction. Many countries felt that this was unnecessary and violated the Rome statute. Again in June 2003, the security council adopted a resolution renewing the exemption for UN peacekeepers from ICC jurisdiction for another year. However, France, Germany and Syria abstained from the voting and many security council members made it clear that this renewal would not be automatic in the coming years.

 The US congress too assisted the Bush administration to obtain bilateral impunity agreements by passing the American Service Members Protection Act. The major anti-ICC provisions in the ASPA are prohibition on US cooperation with the ICC; authorizing the US president to use all means ?necessary or appropriate? to free US personnel detained or imprisoned by the ICC; a prohibition on US participation in peacekeeping processes unless immunity for US personnel is guaranteed. 

 The ICC is meant to prosecute horrendous crimes against humanity and comes into play only when the domestic courts have shown themselves unwilling or unable to prosecute the perpetrators. It has now gained special urgency against the backdrop of the massacres in Rwanda, Cambodia and the Balkans. The US has exerted a positive influence in setting up of tribunals to deal with allegations of war crimes in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. Indeed, the US?s participation would strengthen the ICC. In the absence of such support, the ICC will have to rely on security provided by the UN peacekeeping forces in the conflict zones. By continuing with its opposition to the ICC, the US threatens to be on the wrong side of history.

 LET THE GOOD TIMES ROLL ON

 Left behind, as always

Economic Reforms: The Indian Experience 

By K.D. Saksena, 

Shipra, Rs 1,200

 How have the economic reforms, which were initiated in 1991, affected the Indian economy? What effect have the reforms had on GDP, employment growth, poverty alleviation, savings, domestic and foreign investment, agriculture, industry, external debt, foreign trade and balance of payments? How have the states fared post-1991, in comparison with the pre-reform years? These issues have been hotly debated by politicians, academics and laymen. But no one has had the last word as all relevant data had not been compiled in a manner that was easily accessible. Not any more, thanks to K.D. Saksena, a former IAS officer and adviser in the Planning Commission.

 Saksena takes data from 1984-85 to 1991-92 for the pre-reform era, while the data from 1994-95 to 2000-01 represents the ?reforms period?. The intervening years, when the reforms were taking shape, have been left out. 

 Several interesting numbers emerge. ?The average annual growth rate of real GDP during reforms was 6.25 per cent as against 5.67 per cent during the pre reforms period. Per capita real GDP also recorded a higher AAGR of 4.07 per cent during reforms compared to 3.68 per cent during pre reforms...Contrary to expectations, the average percent share of the public sector in real GDP remained at almost the same level during the pre reforms (25.53 per cent) and the reforms (25.89 per cent) periods?.

 Among the conclusions are: ?Privatization efforts so far have not resulted in any significant reduction in the number of PSUs or mobilization of sizeable resources by disinvestments.? Saksena recommends ?broad-basing the ownership and management of PSUs by selling Government equity to the general public or the workers, or making ?strategic sales? of PSUs on a selective basis ...to reduce budgetary deficit.?

 A study of development disparities results in a state-wise listing of the human poverty index which measures deprivation in terms of mortality, probability of not surviving upto age 40, nutrition, adult literacy and a decent standard of living (below income poverty line, access to water, and so on). The HPI is listed in tandem with the human development index which takes into account not only income, but also life expectancy, literacy and enrolment in schools. What emerges is that there is a huge and burgeoning gap between the states which have been lagging behind and the faster growing ones with regard to almost all economic parameters regardless of reforms.

 Reforms and fiscal discipline also do not go together. ?Revenue Deficits of the Centre and States combined, as well of the Centre and the States separately, have been higher during the reforms than the pre-reforms decade.? The chapter, ?India and China: Lessons from Chinese Economic Reforms?, compares the economic reforms undertaken in the two countries and their results. Saksena finds that China is so far ahead in every field that no real lessons can be learnt here. ?It may not be possible...to achieve the rates of domestic savings and investment achieved by China (around 40 per cent of GDP)? and ?India may not be able to reduce the annual average rate of population growth to less than one per cent, due to constraints of a democratic society and polity?.

 RAISING THE CAP

 There was never much doubt that the insurance regulator would back the government?s move to hike the foreign direct investment limit in the sector to 49 per cent. Nevertheless its reiteration of that backing should serve as a reminder of the reasons why FDI is urgently required in insurance. The vast changes that have taken place in Indian insurance since the sector was opened up need to be appreciated. The market has grown more than three-fold in the last five years. Several new products have been introduced, such as product liability insurance, professional liability insurance, weather insurance and so on. Insurance is an industry that needs vast amounts of capital, and there?s a long gap, especially in the life insurance business, before an insurance company starts generating profits. If there?s a lack of capital in the initial years, business and growth suffer. Many of the smaller Indian partners involved in insurance will have difficulty in putting up the capital required to grow the business. This is all the more true because, with a cap of 26 per cent on FDI, the Indian partners have to pump in 74 per cent of new capital raised. Many foreign insurance players have come to this country in the hope that the FDI limit will be increased in the future. Even if it is contended that foreign players will stay the course, because of the vast potential of the Indian market, it is also true that a 26 per cent cap has deterred a lot of players from coming into the country. In other words, were the limit on FDI to be raised, it would attract more players, which will lead to increased competition, which in turn will lead to better and cheaper products and a higher standard of service. Insurance penetration is still very low compared to the Asian average. A country like South Korea, with a fraction of India?s population, does more than twice the business done in India. A higher level of insurance penetration will help mitigate risks in the Indian economy, which can serve a social purpose, especially in a society that has no safety nets. For instance, crop insurance and weather insurance could serve this purpose. Expanding the insurance business will not only raise the level of savings in the economy but will also ensure that long-term funds are available for infrastructure development. Long-term debt markets too will receive a boost as funds with insurance companies increase.

 All these are rational arguments. But the problem is that the principal hurdle to raising the FDI limit has been the left?s objection to it. The left has never been particularly rational.

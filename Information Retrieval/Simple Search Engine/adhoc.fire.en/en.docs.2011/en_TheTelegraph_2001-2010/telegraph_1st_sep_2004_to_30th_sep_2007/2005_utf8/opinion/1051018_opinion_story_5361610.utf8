 HUANGPU AND HOOGHLY

 Why does Calcutta hesitate to become like Noida and Gurgaon while Shanghai dares Paris and New York? asks Sumit Mitra

 Shanghai by night

 To a Calcuttan on a tour of Shanghai, the one-hour cruise down the Huangpu river from Jinling Pier, for 90 yuan (Rs 450 approximately), is a mix of awe, wonder and embarrassment. He will be wonderstruck at the sight of the Bund for its unmistakable similarity with Strand Road and its neo-classical buildings. Like Strand Road, the Shanghai Bund is a 2 km ribbon of historic waterfront buildings which are caught in a time-warp. If Calcutta has its share of memories of bloody wars fought against the colonial masters, so has Shanghai, which has fought the British and French. But unlike the eastern bank of the Hooghly in Calcutta, the Shanghai waterfront is not a museum of ruined industry but a daring assertion of a nation?s identity. 

 The similarity between Calcutta and Shanghai ends as the boat glides past the old Hongkong and Shanghai Bank building, which, though half-a-century younger than the Imperial Bank (now State Bank of India) building on Strand Road, has been buffeted no less by the ebb and tide of the global economy. It is now the headquarters of the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, but is waiting to house the HSBC headquarters as it is shifted from Hong Kong in the near future. 

 The building was restored in 1999. When it was built in 1923, the HSBC authorities ordered the architects, Palmer amp; Turner, to make the building ?dominate the Bund?. It still does so. The bronze lions that guard the building are replicas of the original, but passers-by still rub them for luck. The traveller can walk under the spectacular domed mosaic ceiling at the octagonal entrance lobby. The dome also carries the eight words of the bank?s motto: ?Within the Four Seas all men are brothers?. As communists overran Shanghai in 1949, the bank, worrying that the mosaic would be lost in the proletarian fury, hid it under layers of thick paint. That?s where it remained for five decades when the building served as the seat of the Shanghai municipal government. It was rediscovered only when Shanghai Pudong Development Bank began restoration work. 

 Even more self-assured is the restoration of the Customs House next to the HSBC building with a distinctive clock tower. Affectionately called the ?Big Ching?, it sounded every 15 minutes until the Cultural Revolution when its chimes were replaced with revolutionary slogans. It was in 2003 that the clock?s acoustic system underwent readjustment to make sure that the chimes were heard above the street din.

 But Shanghai is not a story of rebuilding the past. For a feel of just how much the city dreams of the future, the traveller should turn to the other bank at Pudong. It is the future Shanghai, anchored by the rocket-like Oriental Pearl TV Tower. Next to it is the 88-story Jinmao Tower, which houses the offices of 37 of the Fortune-500 companies. There are 275 more of them scattered across Pudong?s high-rise jungle, with another hundred on the old Shanghai side. The top 33 floors of Jinmao house the Grand Hyatt hotel which, admittedly, enables the management to call it the world?s ?highest? hotel. A view of the Oriental Pearl TV Tower, the tallest in Asia, from the 75th floor of Grand Hyatt, can be spine-chilling. However, Jinmao?s vertical advantage is under threat from the Shanghai World Financial Centre which will come up by 2007. 

 But that is not all. The works in progress include the world?s tallest Ferris Wheel, which, at 656 feet tall, will top the London Eye by 213 feet. For a taste of speed on the world?s fastest train, one can board the Mag-Lev (Magnetic Levitation) that runs from the airport to Pudong?s Longyang subway station. The 30 km journey takes eight minutes. The test train was built by two German technology experts, Siemens and ThyssenKrupp, as a bait for bigger contracts. But the Chinese have their own ultra-high-speed trains in the works. Come the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, and the high-speed link between Shanghai and Beijing will begin its run. The distance that takes two hours on a jet plane will be covered in five hours on the new fast train. 

 Till 1990, Pudong was a marshland, like Calcutta?s Salt Lake in the Fifties. Today it houses over 6,000 foreign-funded businesses, and many more thousands are sending their representatives everyday through the city?s showcase airport ? which has four terminals and 28 runways ? to look for opportunity in the Pudong Special Economic Zone. Shanghai is in the eye of the Chinese economic typhoon that?s surging through the global economy, its low costs setting the price of everything from Nokia handsets and Louis Vuitton handbags to Dell computers and even Boeing aircraft. 

 On the other hand, the Chinese appetite dictates the global prices of most raw materials, like crude oil, minerals and iron ore, not to speak of soya bean, the price of which is sky-rocketing worldwide due to China?s new taste for tofu. 

 What is there in the Huangpu water that the Hooghly lacks? The colonialists had exploited Shanghai with no less fervour than Calcutta. In fact, they preferred Calcutta as their compradors in Bengal helped them sell opium to China. The two cities saw the advent of communism, and the terminal decline of their traditional industries, in the same decade ? the Twenties. Since the late Forties, they were both subject to demographic upheavals, with waves of immigrants pushing for jobs and shelters. 

 But why is Calcutta a forgotten place on the tourist map while Shanghai is among the most sought after? Why does every new building in Shanghai compete with the UN Plaza in New York whereas a matchbox apartment block makes front page news in Calcutta? When Deng Xiaoping said ?to be rich is glorious?, he found echoes across the Communist Party of China. But when a lone Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee quotes Deng to say pretty much the same thing, he is confronted with blank looks in his party, if not sniggers. Why can Shanghai dare Paris and New York but Calcutta hesitates to dare even Noida or Gurgaon? Bengal taught India, if not Asia, how to dream big. Why has it left the task of dreaming to a handful of tired and slumberous politicians?

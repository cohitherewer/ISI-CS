 AN AESTHETIC EXPERIENCE

 Add to the taste

 The Spice Route: A History 

 By John Keay, John Murray, 

 pound; 4.40

 Spices are the world?s first globalizers. Long before Marx noted the expansionist propensities of capital and long before the whiz kids of IT had made the world into a village, obscure leaves and vegetables had spread across the world to unify it in terms of taste and fragrance.

 Spices are nothing save a sensual and aesthetic experience. Keay, in this superbly researched book, avers that spices, contrary to popular belief, do not have any medicinal or preservative value. They add to taste and smell. Yet at one time. spices were the most valued commodity of world trade and linked the most remote parts of Asia and the Americas with the rest of the world through an intricate trading network. The great explorations of the Renaissance were driven not by the search for gold but by the quest for spices. Keay traces the routes on which the spices travelled from the earliest times of recorded history. 

 The construction of a narrative on as mobile a commodity as spice is not easy. First and foremost, there is the problem of definition. There is no clear norm that makes a vegetable into a spice and vice versa. Ginger, for example. Is it a spice or a vegetable? Keay writes, ?If ginger can be grown on deck, or on someone?s window-sill, it loses the exoticism associated with spice.? Is the exotic an element in the definition/identification of something as a spice? But substance is often more important than provenance: herbs are green and leafy, spices dried and leafless. But this simple definition does not solve problems since there is the question of dried herbs. Keay quotes The Oxford Companion to Food to help matters: ?Thus mustard greens would be a herb, mustard seeds a spice, while mustard in a mustard pot, at table, would be a condiment.? 

 The issue is further complicated by the fact that what is called a spice in current usage does not always conform with traditional usage. In the ancient world, spices went far beyond the edible. Keay says: ?In the context of an ancient trade ...route, it [the word spices] was used in a much less restricted sense. This recognized the importance of spices in the preparation of not just food and drink but medicines, ointments, cosmetics, air-freshners, aphrodisiacs, fumigants and dyes? Under this catch-all definition even manufactured goods like Indian cottons and Chinese silks could be lumped into the spice trade.? Items not intended for the kitchen or the table were labelled spices. Keay traces this confusion to the Latin noun species. In Roman times, it often implied value; it came to mean type or kind of article on which import duty was payable. It seems to have been in this context, Keay writes, that it gave rise to the French epice and the English ?spice?.

 Spices travelled from the islands in the Banda Sea all the way to Europe, by sea and by land. Ships moved hugging the peninsula that hang out of the Eurasian land mass ? Malaya, India, Arabia, Africa. They moved overland on the peninsulas. This method of transportation functioned till the route around the Cape of Good Hope was discovered. Keay is quick to emphasize that the transformation of the complicated sea-land route into the sea route was not a result of European initiative alone. Rather, it was the result of a cumulative process going back two millennia.

 But knowledge about the Orient dispelled the mystique of spices, and their ready availability took away their distinction. From the late 18th century, world trade began to move to the rhythms of other commodities. If spices were important to the Jan Company, tea was crucial to the English East India Company. The definition of spices also became restricted. Only culinary additives qualified. Today, as Keay points out, garam masala contains only two recognized spices ? ginger and clove. Herbs have invaded spices ? paprika, lemon grass, fennel, mustard and so on. The battle for a definition continues. Keay puts his readers in his debt because of his lucid exposition of complicated issues that stretch back in time. It is a fascinating history, fascinatingly told.

 ANOTHER CITY

 Daydreaming is usually a harmless activity. But there is something rather alarmingly absurd about the chief minister?s all-embracing plan to convert Calcutta into a veritable Garden of Earthly Delights, in which all environmental problems are going to be magically solved. Here is, indeed, a rare breed of visionary in action. Yet, Calcuttans would have to be a particularly credulous lot to believe that a government which cannot even run a polio programme properly or enforce a simple ban on plastic bags, would, all of a sudden, get its act together and rid the city of air and water pollution, plant trees everywhere, improve waste management, conserve its wetlands, develop and beautify the riverfront, parks and public toilets, restore canals, promote solar energy, treat waste water, civilize its crematoria, and turn Greater Calcutta into a model of good governance and civic action. There is a kind of insult to the ordinary citizen in the unthinking ambitiousness of the chief minister?s three-year, Rs 400 crore ?master plan?, and in the rationale behind coming up with it at this point of time. The reason seems not to be that these things are absolutely necessary for their own sake, that this is the least that any government ought to be ensuring for its citizens in any case, but that sprucing up the city will attract investors.

 A sudden great flow of money, the chief minister seems to be convinced, will radically transform not only the appearance of the city, but also bring about fundamental changes in the government?s modus operandi and in the citizens? attitudes or behaviour ? and that too, in three years. Immense amounts of foreign funding have already been pumped into the government-run healthcare infrastructure; every year, the Centre allocates funds for rural education schemes. But all this money is yet to make any noticeable difference in the spheres for which they are allocated. The ability to manage such a scale of funding, to meet deadlines, set up standards of corruption-free accountability are basic requirements for such developmental ambitions. The Left Front government is yet to prove its ability in handling the most basic problems in healthcare, education and pollution control, to name only a few essential areas in which its performance remains abysmal. If he wants his plan to be taken seriously at all, Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee should think hard before giving free rein to the quixotic imagination.

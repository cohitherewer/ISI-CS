 Letters to Editor

 Escape the dirt

 Sir ? Saif Ali Khan, may or may not have deserved the best actor award for Hum Tum, but he is in a perfectly-avoidable controversy. Fingers are being pointed at his mother, Sharmila Tagore, currently the chairperson of the censor board. Earlier, Ajay Devgan found himself in a similar situation after being awarded for The Legend of Bhagat Singh as Prakash Jha, who had directed him in Gangaajal, was a member of the jury for the awards. To avoid such controversies, the jury should be formed predominantly from people unconnected with the film world. 

 Yours faithfully,

 R. Sekar, Angul

 Sealed off

 Sir ? Why does freedom of movement need to be curbed in the ?oasis of peace? (?Metro terror shield with seal on extra exits?, July 10)? Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and his party want us to believe that the government is run by the ?people?of this state. Naturally, in any situation, the people (call it the ?mob?) take law into their own hands to uphold justice. In such an environment, communist leaders should not have any fear for their lives, nor for those of others. 

 According to the left, secularism flows through the sinews of West Bengal. The inhabitants of this state therefore should have no fear from the kind of terror that became so palpable in Ayodhya and London. Tony Blair may have to invest a lot to contain such terrorism, but not Bhattacharjee. The left?s cosy relationship with certain sections of the population can take care of that. The money thus saved can be used in the development of the state. Bhattacharjee then would not have to travel with his begging bowl to New Delhi.

 Yours faithfully,

Sunil Kumar Pal, London

 Sir ? I don?t think that the security at the Metro stations can prevent a terrorist attack from happening. The system is flawed. Besides, even now, people are not subjected to much detection inside the stations. More security guards should be deployed, more metal detectors put in place, and people be actually made to pass through them. 

 Yours faithfully,

Vinay Dokania, Howrah

 Sir ? Calcutta?s underground is hardly immune to terrorist strikes. Passengers do not care to pass through the metal detector, and even if the gates signal the presence of metal, there are never enough security personnel to conduct a search. If people do not abide by the rules themselves, they should be made to obey them. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Sir ? Given the growing terrorist threat everywhere in the world, the government should stop issuing licences for the ownership and use of private aircraft (?Buy an aircraft for Rs 40 lakh?, July 13). One could imagine how easy it would be for a terrorist to take hold of such a small aircraft and create havoc in the country, especially given the alertness and efficiency of our security staff. The proliferation of private aircraft at affordable costs will surely boost anti-social activities, abduction and smuggling. This country is still not ready for rich executives with private jets.

 Yours faithfully, 

Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir ? Ashok V. Desai professes to be a fan of Amitav Ghosh and yet insists that The Hungry Tide is Ghosh?s first book set in Bengal (?Hungry for a tilde?, July 12) This is surprising since a self-professed fan should know that all but two of Ghosh?s books are substantially or wholly set in Bengal. Incidentally, what does Desai mean when he writes that Ghosh has ?made even Bengal look romantic in the book??

 Yours faithfully,

A. Ray, Calcutta

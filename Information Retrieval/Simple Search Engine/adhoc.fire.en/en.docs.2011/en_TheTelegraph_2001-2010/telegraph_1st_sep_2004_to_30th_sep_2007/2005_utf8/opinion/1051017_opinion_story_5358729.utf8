 LAST MILE PROBLEMS WITH THE NAGAS

Twenty-Twenty - Bharat Bhushan

 Working towards a compromise

 After eight years of cease-fire, the Naga peace process has finally started making some progress. However, the proper implementation of the ceasefire between the Indian security forces and the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah) and some conceptual problems still dog the two sides.

 The NSCN (IM) claims that more of its cadre have been killed in the eight years of the ceasefire since 1997 (exceeding 100) than in the previous nine-and-a-half years (only 40), when the insurgency was at its peak. The NSCN (IM) claims that the number of Indian security personnel killed by its cadre after the ceasefire is zero, compared to more than 200 in the nine-and-half years preceding the ceasefire. This included seven colonels killed in the single year 1993-94.

 Under these circumstances, the general secretary of the NSCN (IM), Thuingaleng Muivah, is bound to be under pressure from his cadre to call off the ceasefire. If this ceasefire breaks down, then so would the other Suspension of Operations Agreements in the North-east, including with the Karbis, Dimasas, Khasis, Bodos and groups in Tripura. A ceasefire with the United Liberation Front of Asom may then seem like a distant dream.

 The argument being given by the Indian security establishment is that the ceasefire is limited to Nagaland alone. Were the NSCN (I-M) to take the same interpretation of the cease-fire, would it be all right for it to target Indian security forces in Manipur, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh or, say, Delhi? Remember that S.C. Jamir had barely escaped a murder attempt at Nagaland House in New Delhi. The government of India cannot have two different interpretations of the cease-fire ? one for its security forces and the other for the Nagas. It is unreasonable to expect that Muivah can keep talking peace while his cadres get ambushed outside Nagaland.

 There are others who claim that if Muivah will not settle, a settlement should be arrived at with the rival faction of S.S. Khaplang or the Naga National Council. Khaplang is a Myanmar Naga supported by the Indian security forces. Indira Gandhi had refused to talk to Khaplang saying that she could not negotiate with a Burmese citizen. Would Indian leaders want to do that now? And if the NNC could settle the Naga issue, then why didn?t the Shillong Accord work, to which the NNC was a signatory? India should attempt to strengthen its main dialogue partner rather than threaten to weaken it.

 A ceasefire is meant to reduce mutual suspicion and make both sides more reasonable as they get to understand each other better. It is evident that eight years of ceasefire have not done this. But what is very clear is that it has made the Naga insurgents more reasonable. From talking about total independence from India, today the Nagas are talking of fashioning a close federal relationship while still claiming that they remain sovereign. When Muivah met the prime minister earlier this year in New Delhi, he told him that the Nagas consider themselves sovereign. This one statement has now become the biggest hurdle in exploring a peaceful settlement. Muivah has time and again said that sovereignty lies with the people. However, New Delhi thinks that Muivah is being deliberately ambiguous about what he means by ?sovereignty?.

 If the Nagas are sovereign then Indian negotiators could argue that they should be able to freely take a decision to pool their sovereignty with that of the rest of India?s ? subject, of course, to the agreement reached with them. In the peace talks in Bangkok last week, it was discussed how the people of Sikkim had decided to exercise their sovereignty to join India. The Nagas might decide to do the same provided constitutional guarantees are provided to maintain their ?uniqueness? ? their distinct cultural, linguistic and political identity. Muivah says he wants a ?federal? relationship with New Delhi. It makes sense from his point of view ? from separateness he wants to negotiate a relationship of closeness. The nature of this relationship, he says, will be determined by the terms of the agreement with New Delhi. 

 New Delhi, on the other hand, wants him to give up ?federalism? and accept the Indian Constitution as it is. What could be the golden mean that satisfies both? Indian negotiators need to ask themselves: Do we want the Indian Constitution to be the point of departure or the point of arrival for a settlement? If the insurgent Nagas can eventually be brought under the purview of the Constitution, with modifications to accommodate them, then what is wrong? One can call it asymmetrical federalism or recognizing ?the unique history and situation of the Nagas?.

 However, though the Indian Union is federal, it is more limited than say, the US. Its history and processes of formation were different. This places limits on how asymmetric our asymmetric federalism can be. Wisdom lies in recognizing this constraint and working within the degrees of freedom it offers. 

 The time has come to give up posturing and climb down from the polemical positions that necessarily have to be taken in the initial stages of a major negotiation of this kind. For this, New Delhi has to stop seeing the acceptance of the Indian Constitution as the point of departure with the Nagas (after all, it has dropped this precondition with the Kashmiris). Muivah, on his part, has to give up ambiguous references to ?sovereignty? and ?federalism?. If the federal relationship he proposes is to be as close as possible to being within the Union of India, then form should compromise with content.

 Within such a compromise, it should be possible to address positively all the proposals made by the NSCN (I-M) ? from sharing of competencies to ensuring that Naga uniqueness is preserved through various instrumentalities and structures of governance. Within the Union of India ? which Muivah does not accept as a framework of settlement ? Nagas can live in a single political unit and govern themselves democratically. The genius of the Indian political leaders will lie in achieving this while keeping the honour of the Nagas intact.

 One of the most remarkable outcomes of the extended ceasefire has been that the Naga civil society groups have gained strength. Today, Naga civil society bodies like the Hoho, Naga Mothers Organization, the Naga Peoples Movement for Human Rights, the Naga Students Organization can criticize the NSCN(I-M) and give direction to the peace process. A decade ago people were assassinated by the underground for trying to do so.

 The NSCN(I-M) has quickly adapted to this change and engaged the Naga civil society organizations ? holding regular consultations with them. Engaging civil society has made the NSCN(I-M) more realistic and appreciative of their influence and criticism. New Delhi, however, has not addressed Naga civil society organizations in any way. The latter also need to be convinced that the Indian Constitution is flexible enough to accommodate the aspirations of the Nagas. If they appreciate the difficulties of the government, then these opinion makers can be a force multiplier for peace with the NSCN (IM).

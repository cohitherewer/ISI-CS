 NIGHTWATCH

 There is always an inexplicable element in human brutality. This is more so when the aggressiveness is collective, the result of an instant public consensus. It is difficult, therefore, to understand mob-lynching in purely psychological or sociological terms. Three middle-aged women from a remote village in Uluberia were walking through a neighbouring village in the dead of night on Friday to buy fruit from a market in order to sell them again in their own village. They happened to be passing by a stretch of land from which peanuts were being stolen regularly. So the farmers had been keeping watch, and on seeing the women, took them to be the thieves. They started beating up the women on the spot and continued doing so until morning, when they were taken to a more public space for the second stage of justice. At the village shibtola, in front of the local school, the next round of beating started, more people having gathered by now to take part in the lynching. Two of the women could not survive the beating and wounding, their spine broken into pieces. One died on the spot and the other in the hospital. The third woman, who has survived, had been wounded in her breasts and salt rubbed into these wounds. Most of the villagers fled once the police arrived, and among the 13 people arrested, nine are women. 

 The three victims were far from thieves. They were extremely poor wage labourers, members of a local self-help group. They had taken some advance from this group in order to buy fruit for reselling before they were taken to be thieves. So the basic structure of civilization ? self-help group, school, police, market, temple-square, hospital ? was in place in this cluster of villages. These places also mark out the space in which the local community performs its rites of proprietorship. Hence, the general sense of the fitness of things among most villagers that thieves had to be punished, and lynching was a perfectly legitimate form of justice. Yet, fleeing en masse on the arrival of the police means that this natural justice does give way, at some point, to another order of guilt and consequent panic. At the root of this is certainly poverty, and the fierce protectiveness towards property individually or jointly held that comes from it. Yet, the terrible surplus of violence ? women battering and torturing women to death ? cannot be wholly accounted for by poverty.

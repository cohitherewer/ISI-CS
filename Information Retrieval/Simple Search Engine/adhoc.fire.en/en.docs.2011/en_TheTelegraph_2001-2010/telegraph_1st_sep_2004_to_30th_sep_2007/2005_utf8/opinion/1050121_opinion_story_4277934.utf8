 UNDER A CLOUD

 Peace talks always have a cloud hanging over them. The collapse of the negotiations between the Andhra Pradesh government and the Maoists is, therefore, not entirely unexpected. Such talks were started and suspended also during the regime of the previous chief minister, Mr N. Chandrababu Naidu. The history of these talks clearly shows that the failure at one point of time need not be the end of the road. On the contrary, the only option is to try and revive the talks because even a bad peace is better than a bloodbath. It was thus sensible of the Union home minister, Mr Shivraj Patil, to suggest that New Delhi would try to persuade Hyderabad to resume the peace process. Successive governments at the Centre and the states, which face a major threat from the Maoist rebellion, have concluded that it was a political problem rather than one of law and order. That makes it necessary for the Centre to take a holistic view of it and not leave the solution to the states alone. There is another reason why the Centre?s involvement is absolutely vital. The failure of the talks in Hyderabad would certainly have a ripple effect in other affected states. 

 It is difficult, though, to expect the Maoists to play fair. Their extremist ideology dictates that they have little to gain from the success of the peace talks and everything to gain from the weakening of the state?s power. If they still agree to talk peace, that is because they want both war and peace to serve their cynical designs. The Andhra Pradesh chief minister, Mr Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, saw through the Maoists? games when he accused them of ?running with the hare and hunting with the hound?. Even as their leaders negotiated with the government, armed Maoist rebels continued to terrorize the people and extort money from them. The rebels withdrew from the talks, blaming the state for the killing of eight of their comrades in police encounters. But there is little doubt that the police action had been necessitated by the Maoists? continued threat to the lives of the common people. This has since been proved by scores of elected representatives of local-government bodies fleeing their rural homes for shelter in Hyderabad and the district headquarters. While it tries to bring the rebels back to the talks, the government must secure the lives of the people and uphold the rule of law. To be effective, the government must act from a position of strength.

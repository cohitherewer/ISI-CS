 A SPACE OF ONE?S OWN

 Beena Sarwar

 One of my favourite early morning things to do in Karachi is to walk on Seaview beach. When I first started doing this, concerned friends asked, ?Is it safe?? Or, ?Aren?t you scared, walking alone?? The answer is, yes it is, and no I?m not ? despite initial apprehensions. The first time, I didn?t have the confidence to do it alone, and went with a friend who lives at Seaview apartments along the beachfront. We walked out of her place and battled the summer evening sea breeze that whipped our hair around our faces, and made our clothes flap wildly around us. That was a couple of summers ago. We never did manage to get our act together to join up for a walk, but my inhibition about walking in that public space was broken.

 Shortly afterwards, I took to walking half the length of the beach and then back, after dropping my daughter to school. Sometimes I?m the only person at the far end, more deserted than the commercial half closer to the city where fancy ?cornice points? and a portable pizza truck now stand, testimony to the corporatization of even this public beach. 

 They?ve been there since the defence housing authorities chased away the monkeywallahs and peanut-sellers who used to cater to the families which crowd the beach in the evenings. The reason given was that these monkeywallahs and their kind were making the place dirty. Now they?re begging at street corners instead, and the beach is still dirty despite the army of municipal workers cleaning it up in the mornings. This is either because the sea washes up a lot of junk or because people don?t use the giant dustbins provided in that half of the beach.

 Take what is yours

 Still, Seaview is not bad as ?urban beaches? go. Some days, it?s quite pristine. Other days, you can see the previous day?s leftovers. Shoes are the most common, eatables? The strangest thing I ever saw was a ram?s head, half-buried in the sand, with two horns. Some days it was more visible, other days more submerged in the sand. It was there for months.

 But mostly, the part of the beach I walk on is washed clean by the sea, so that all you have to contend with are footprints of those who were there before you. Some were bare footed, others wore joggers, or rubber slippers? some walked with a limp. At that time of the morning, you encounter few other people walking on the sand ? but now, other women are also visible Some, like me, have a dog in tow. Sometimes couples stroll by walking close together ? in post-Zia Pakistan, a sight rare enough in public to be memorable.

 Actually, a woman walking alone in public is also a rare enough sight, and reason why people asked me how I felt about it. Even rarer is the sight of a woman cycling anywhere ? as women of my mother?s generation used to do until the mid-Sixties. Of course women are visible in bazaars and in semi-public parks that are becoming popular with the urban middle classes.

 But even this still smacks of defiance for those of us who grew up during the Zia years, when women were pretty much banished from public spaces and could not even be shown running on television because the authorities considered it ?provocative?. What this says about their mindset is another matter, but it did have the effect of inhibiting women?s sports and physical movement in the public sphere.

 It is only now that some women in the big cities feel empowered enough to walk out in public in trousers and T-shirts. A colleague in fact commented that women in public now walk more confidently than he remembers them doing before. 

 I remember reading about the ?Women Take Back the Night? movement, in which women in some North American cities would come out to ?reclaim? spaces that had been denied them by male harassment or lack of safety. I think it?s time that women in Pakistan also did the same.

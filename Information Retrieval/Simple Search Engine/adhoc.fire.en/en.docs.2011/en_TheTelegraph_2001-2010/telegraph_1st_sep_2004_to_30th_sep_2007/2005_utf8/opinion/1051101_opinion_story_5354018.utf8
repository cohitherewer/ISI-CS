 BRING THE PAST TO LIFE 

 Rather than fight for custody of the 

 past, those who frame syllabi would do better to look at conditions 

 in the classroom, writes Janaki Nair

 Change of outlook 

 In the midst of the political 

 disarray that the Indian right finds itself in today, the 

 public quarrels between sets of (largely Delhi-based) historians 

 about the priorities of the national curriculum framework 

 and the proposed new NCERT history (and to a lesser extent 

 social science) textbooks must seem as godsend. One wishes 

 the right would appreciate the need for robust public debate 

 on curriculum content and pedagogy, which is what the current 

 discussions exemplify. 

 Still, the strong reaction of 

 the old guard to the new emphasis on making the curriculum 

 ?child-centred? brings to the fore concerns that are not 

 strictly about education or pedagogy, but about who should 

 have custody of the past. As long as the opponents of the 

 new initiatives emphasize the importance of such custody, 

 and are reluctant to relinquish their hold on interpretations 

 of the past, the path remains open for future political 

 masters ? of whatever political orientation ? to assert 

 their right to revision as well. The new efforts must thus 

 be seen and supported as a strategy that steers away from 

 the old obsessions with secularism/communalism as the single 

 litmus test of the quality of a history textbook.

 In a recent intervention, Romila 

 Thapar rightly suggests that the focus must move away from 

 textbooks to the retraining of teachers and the production 

 of conditions and materials conducive to learning. Yet her 

 suggestions are haunted by the fear of losing custody over 

 the past. Expressing disquiet over the suggestion of the 

 NCF that attempts be made to use ?local knowledges?, she 

 suggests that the older national frameworks must be retained 

 for their focus on progress and development, and on ?a larger 

 national perspective?.

 Never has the gap between professional 

 historians and social scientists, and pedagogues at the 

 lower levels been greater. A wide range of regional and 

 national textbooks in circulation today have remained untouched 

 by the new perspectives that historians have produced over 

 the past four decades. This includes the old NCERT books 

 which are clearly outdated in style and content. In most 

 cases, they also remain immune to the range of issues ? 

 pertaining to groups such as women, tribals and the lower 

 castes ? that the workings of Indian democracy have thrown 

 up as challenges to schools and textbooks. 

 Many state-level books have, on 

 the other hand, warmly embraced the more contentious interpretations 

 of history offered by those who distrust the professional 

 historian. Such an embrace had not occurred only as a consequence 

 of the interventions of the political right. The emphasis 

 of the Karnataka textbooks, introduced in 2002 and subsequently 

 withdrawn ? both under the auspices of a Congress government 

 ? was an instance of this misplaced trust in the new ?scientific 

 historians.?.

 Away from the realm of state textbooks, 

 private schools use books whose orientations are bizarre 

 and not always written at the behest of the Hindu right. 

 At least one leading English language (convent) school in 

 Calcutta, for instance, on whom not the merest shadow of 

 communal suspicion may be cast, uses a text for its third 

 standard that devotes six chapters to the Hindu epics as 

 ?our shared history?. Another refers to Christ?s miracles, 

 perhaps to make history more absorbing for the child. Clearly, 

 the unprofessional and problematic approach to the invention 

 of a golden Indian past stems not just from the textbooks 

 and school histories alone. It has a wider and far more 

 disturbing presence and circulation. 

 The encouraging news is that groups 

 all over the country who have tried to engage with the dilemmas 

 of the school syllabus are becoming sensitive to the problems 

 faced by history-teachers and students. 

 Let me take examples from my own 

 recent experience. Over the past year, a group of professional 

 historians at the Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, 

 including myself, have developed a series of workshops for 

 high-school history teachers in Calcutta. The very first 

 meeting with teachers was sobering and instructive. 

 Teachers despair, much less at 

 the content of the textbook, and more at the sheer size 

 of the syllabus, which they claim leaves them no time to 

 talk about historical certainties in a more complex manner. 

 Second, the ever-present spectre of the examination acts 

 as an effective curb on discussion and learning. Third, 

 we were told, the students? lack of interest in history 

 has a great deal to do with its being widely perceived as 

 a subject that builds no skills at all, with an excessive 

 focus on memorizing and retention of names and dates.

 Perhaps most importantly, we were 

 told that prejudices, particularly communal prejudices, 

 were rarely if ever related to actual historical detail, 

 and indeed many attitudes were already in place before any 

 history is taught. The examination system, which emphasizes 

 factual knowledge, ensures that students are adept at arriving 

 at the ?right answer? with no corresponding change in perceptions 

 or attitudes, whether in directions encouraged by the right 

 or the left .

 Even the most well-intentioned 

 syllabus-framing and textbook-writing thus may have only 

 a limited impact on attitudinal change. It is precisely 

 because revision cannot be merely an additive exercise that 

 the NCERT curriculum framework, syllabus and textbooks are 

 being thoroughly overhauled, taking into consideration, 

 perhaps for the first time in post-independence history, 

 the capacity of students and teachers to deal with a bewildering 

 array of changes that are taking place in India today. The 

 new efforts are also addressing the importance of inculcating 

 the skills of evaluating evidence and arriving at conclusions 

 among students of history. 

 The proposed new history syllabus 

 for the senior classes is thematic, focusing not only on 

 the singular commitment to build national pride but also 

 to demonstrate the very different historical experiences, 

 say of the North-east or the South, that make up the rich 

 tapestry of Indian history. South India?s one-and-a-half 

 century long engagement with questions of caste, and its 

 long historical accommodation of minority religions, will 

 provide the necessary breadth that the ?national? narrative 

 had long suppressed. 

 The new syllabus is also willing 

 to engage with controversies in history rather than skirt 

 them. But above all, in its attempt to historicize everyday 

 themes such as sport or clothing, and in radically redefining 

 the system of assessment, it will hopefully rekindle an 

 interest in history and develop a sense of the past that 

 the heavy and repeated emphasis on national political histories 

 has failed to achieve. Such transformations must not be 

 seen as trivializing history but as a necessary and urgent 

 step towards building intellectual abilities and fresh political 

 sensibilities that are in danger of being swamped by those 

 who are obsessed with national pride, and also those, of 

 the new economic order, who are intent on turning out a 

 nation of service-providers.

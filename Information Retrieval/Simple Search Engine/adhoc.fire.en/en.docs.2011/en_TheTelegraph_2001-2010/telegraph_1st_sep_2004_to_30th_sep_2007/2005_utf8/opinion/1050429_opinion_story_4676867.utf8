 HISTORY AT HIS COMMAND

 Bare truths

 In command of History: Churchill Fighting and Writing the Second World War

 By David Reynolds, 

 Penguin, ? 22.5

 In the Anglo-Saxon world, Winston Churchill?s The Second World War is considered the authoritative history of that event. There are good reasons for this high acclaim. It was written by one of the principal actors who was also a master of English prose and, at the time of writing, had at his command all the official documents, including some classified papers. David Reynolds has the courage to puncture this reputation through a detailed analysis of Churchill?s mode of writing and his representation of the events and decisions in which he played a crucial part.

 Reynolds?s research shows that large parts of Churchill?s monumental history of the world war were not actually written by him. Churchill was the first to organize a syndicate for the research and the writing of his book. The syndicate consisted of an Oxford don, William Deakin, the wartime military secretary to the cabinet, ?Pug? Ismay, and a former vice-chief of the Imperial General Staff, Sir Henry Pownall. To this formidable team was added the cabinet secretary after the war, Norman Brook, who read the text, commented on it and, at times, wrote parts of it. Churchill?s syndicate wrote out drafts based on its research; Churchill then rewrote these drafts, adding sometimes his unique turns of phrase and purple passages; but often he incorporated the drafts without even changing anything.

 Churchill took on the mammoth enterprise under strained personal circumstances. In the immediate aftermath of the war, Churchill lost his prime ministership when the overwhelming majority of Britons voted for Labour. He had little or no income and did not have a place to stay. The Second World War secured his fortune and his place in history. The book fetched him ? through advances and the selling of serialization rights ? something like two-and-a-quarter million dollars. Churchill took advantage of his position as former premier; Reynolds writes, ?At the time when he wrote, no ordinary mortal could expect to inspect, let alone reprint, wartime documents.? The special imprint of authority that the volumes carry is derived from this unique access to records that Churchill extracted from the British Cabinet Office.

 The volumes were written between 1946 and 1954. During these years, Churchill was first trying to get back to power, and then once in power, he suffered a stroke and entered the twilight of his life. Reynolds?s book looks at Churchill?s text and also at the times in which it was written and the reception it received at the time. This is a book about a book and Reynolds?s playing off of Churchill?s version of events against what is now known of those events is as brilliant as it is revealing about Churchill?s motives and intentions.

 The events of those years left their mark on the text. Churchill?s handling of the role of the Soviet Union during the war could not escape the shadow of the Cold War. Churchill was not above, as Reynolds shows, tutoring his sources to glorify his role and to play down his errors. As Michael Foot noted in his review of one of the volumes, Churchill?s carefulness as an autobiographer was matched by his carelessness as a historian. Reynolds lays bare Churchill?s version of Churchill?s war.

 THE BUTCHER, THE BAKER

 There is a kind of word-music in the two names sounded together that would appeal to children. ?Messrs George Bush and Tony Blair? sounds proper and boring. But the moment one says ?Bush and Blair?, or better still, ?Mr Bush and Mr Blair?, the fun begins. In the two Bs and the short monosyllables, the push of ?Bush? followed by the bleat of ?Blair?, are the beginnings of irreverent verse, something along the lines of that Oxbridge women?s-college jingle: ?Miss Beale and Miss Buss/ Are not women like us.? Even ?George and Tony? might be fun to play with, like Edith Sitwell?s ?Daisy and Lily/ Lazy and silly??. So it might not come as a surprise that a light-heartedly damning little poem about the British prime minister, ?Baker Tony?s Pizza?, has been judged the best nursery rhyme ?for the new millennium? by a popular TV channel in Britain. 

 It tells how Baker Tony bakes a pizza in which the promised olives never get put in, what was being passed off as grated cheese turns out to be yellow sawdust, and the ?rich tomato topping/ Was nothing more than dye/ So Baker Tony?s pizza/ Made all the children cry.? The poem?s author, Ms Angela Martin, wanted to make children aware of ?the politics of the Iraq War?, but not too heavy-handedly. The anti-war movement in Britain is an impressive instance of how ordinary people could make political protest part of their everyday lives out of a shared sense of betrayal. These protests have taken place in a society where Mr Blair?s experiments with truth have also provoked endless play on his surname. And his smile is now part of the post-9/11 repertory of publicly held images. ?Blair + grin? on Google Search yields a rich harvest of 424,000 entries. It is also bizarre how another children?s tale has now become part of the 9/11 story. After hearing about a second plane crashing into the twin towers, Mr Bush, then visiting an elementary school in Florida, was silent for about 30 seconds, and then began to read out ?The Pet Goat? to the children: ?A girl got a pet goat. But the goat did some things that made the girl?s dad mad.? 

 Nursery rhymes and children?s stories seldom originate in the nursery. The traditional English nursery rhymes preserve not only the counting poems of real fishermen and shepherds, pagan charms and drinking songs, but also ballads lampooning kings and queens, like the Jacobite rhyme of ?William and Mary, George and Anne?. These lose their political sting with time and become bits of dead history embedded in living language and memory that keep the rhymes and forget the rhymers. (Who remembers that ?Mary Had a Little Lamb? was written by Sarah Josepha Hale of Boston in 1830?) So another couple of centuries into the new millennium, when nobody would care very much about Mr Blair and the politics of the Iraq war, children might still be singing about a dodgy baker and his fake pizza.

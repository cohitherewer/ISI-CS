 MISGUIDING FORCE

 The Congress is primarily responsible for the mess in Bihar, both in the immediate past and the present, writes Sumanta Sen

 Wrong calculations

 The Congress seems to be living in a world of its own. At least, that?s the impression it gives in Bihar and elsewhere in the Hindi heartland. In a state where it almost ceases to matter, it is being high and mighty. In the elections earlier this year, it spurned Laloo Yadav?s offer of a small number of seats, allied with Ram Vilas Paswan and came a cropper, managing to bag only ten seats. This time it has hitched itself to the RJD wagon but is behaving as if it is the master of the show. Not only has it got Laloo Yadav to agree not to project himself or his wife as the United Progressive Alliance?s chief ministerial candidate, it has threatened Paswan with dire consequences if he does not fall in line. The party is being able to do this because it leads the ruling combination in New Delhi.

 But what is its position even at the Centre? It has around 140 seats in the Lok Sabha, way behind the half-way mark of 270. To survive, it needs each and every ally ? a situation that, one would expect, would give rise to humility. The Congress, however, is unwilling to recognize its station in life. Though without a foothold in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, it tells Laloo Yadav and Ram Vilas Paswan what they should do and gets Rahul Gandhi, a novice in politics, to needle Mulayam Singh Yadav. If the Congress feels this is the way it can storm into Lucknow, it has got a thing coming.

 Coming back to Bihar. Why did Laloo Yadav accept the fatwa from 10 Janpath? For only one reason. He wants to avoid a split in the non-National Democratic Alliance votes as much as possible. Last time his party won 75 seats. If he can raise that number to around 90, he will be able to show the Congress who?s the real boss since that will mean a similar rise in the number of seats of the allies, and make it possible for him to stop the NDA from coming to power. It is then that Laloo Yadav will insist before his partners that as the largest party, the Rashtriya Janata Dal has the right to choose the chief minister. It has to be remembered that he has agreed not to project himself or Rabri Devi as the candidate for the job, but he has not said that they would stay away from it if the opportunity comes their way again. 

 The Congress then will have to eat humble pie. There is also another angle to the situation. Will the agreement with Laloo Yadav hold good if Paswan continues to stick to his ground? Alternately, if Paswan comes round and the agreement stays, then the UPA will be seen as going into battle without a leader, unlike the NDA which has Nitish Kumar leading it. Before any election, people want to know who the next chief minister may be and here the UPA will be at a disadvantage.

 This is all the creation of the Congress. Even where it has no ground to stand upon, it likes to be seen as the guiding force. In Bihar, it also wants to convince people that it had no role to play during the ?misrule? of Laloo Yadav first and then that of his wife. What it seems to conveniently forget is that it was a part of the coalition over which the RJD presided and so the criticism also touches it. But try explaining that to the Congress. While threatening Paswan with marching orders unless he agreed to give up his third front, the Congress should have kept in mind a fact. That it had itself helped split the ?secular? votes, both in Bihar and Jharkhand, by opting for the company of Paswan without seeking to bring him and Laloo Yadav together. Or does it believe that there are different standards for the palace and for the ordinary folk?

 On his part, Paswan has said that he would rather give up his ministry than support the RJD. He may well swallow his words as politicians often do, but there is also good reason to suspect why he may not do so. Ever since he fell out with Laloo Yadav after last year?s Lok Sabha election, Paswan has had a single point programme, that is attacking Yadav and his wife. Now if he suddenly decides to bury the hatchet, a whole lot of uncomfortable questions will be asked. That is a risk Paswan cannot take. Such a move will particularly upset the upper caste Bhumihars with whom he seems to have built up an equation.

 There are other reasons also. Paswan knows that even if a unified UPA wins the polls, there won?t be much for him in such a scenario. Leave alone the chief ministership, Laloo Yadav will see to it that Paswan?s men do not get the plum posts in the cabinet. After he finds proper berths for his own people and that of the Congress, what will be left to offer Paswan? According to the present law, no ministry can be expanded at will. Its size has to be kept restricted to 15 per cent of that of the legislature.

 On the other hand, if Paswan, by fighting as an opponent of both the RJD and the BJP, is able to bag a fair number of seats, he will be in a bargaining position with Nitish Kumar. As things stand, the Janata Dal(U) is unlikely to get a majority on its own. In such a case, Paswan may offer to fill in, provided the BJP stays out, lending support from outside. Nitish Kumar should have no objections to this and neither the Bharatiya Janata Party, which is desperate to have an NDA victory in Bihar. The BJP must have also noticed the enviable position in which the left is at the Centre, where it has remained outside but manages to hold the whip.

 Paswan must have got all this worked out. Yes, by joining Nitish Kumar, he may lose the support of present allies like the Communist Party of India and the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist), but they can only be small fry to him. As for the Congress, if it needs him so badly in Bihar, then it should have behaved accordingly. The Congress should have also realized by now that its name has been sullied in Bihar for too long. Laloo Yadav joined hands with it from a position of strength, but Paswan is yet to be sure of his strength. And he really cannot be blamed if he refuses to bow down to a force that has become negligible. Indeed, when the results come out, it will be interesting to note whether the ruling party at the Centre has been able to cross the 20 mark.

 Much of this mess could have been avoided had the Congress, at the outset, told both Laloo Yadav and Paswan to behave. But it did not, hoping perhaps that it would gain by playing one against the other. That has not happened, and now it is adopting a high and mighty attitude where it should have been the bridge between the two. A true leader of an alliance would have done that to keep his flock together but that is a task unknown to the Congress. And quite clearly, it is not even prepared to try and learn.

 Of course, all this will become meaningless if the apex court rules that the dissolution of the house was not in order and that the assembly should be constituted with those elected last time. Such a decision will bring smiles on every face, for the victors in that election had not become MLAs and hence had not earned any salary. It will also not be that bad for the RJD. With 75 in the house, not only will it be a vocal opposition, it will also have an opportunity to buy those who are sure to become disgruntled once the ministry is formed. The loser will be Paswan, as almost all his men had switched over to the JD(U). The Congress will also be the loser as it will be seen to have got Buta Singh to perform an illegal act. It will be another setback for it in the state.

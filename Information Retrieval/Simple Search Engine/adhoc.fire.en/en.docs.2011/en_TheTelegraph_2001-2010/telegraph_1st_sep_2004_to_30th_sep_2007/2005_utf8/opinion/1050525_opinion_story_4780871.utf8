 SENSITIVE SOULS

 The abuse of the word, ?sensitive?, has never been more lamentable in India. Religious enthusiasm is perhaps the most powerful factor behind turning one of the gentlest words in the English language into one of the most oppressive. It is certainly a very serious crisis in democracy when books and films bring out the most violent emotions in sensitive people. Such sensitivities place any society on the treacherous foundation of fears, resentments, unfreedoms and unreason. And the dangers are manifest. The two blasts that violently disrupted the screenings of Jo Bole So Nihaal in Delhi have spread panic all over the country. Cinema halls have stopped screening the film in most major cities and towns, Mumbai being a notable exception. West Bengal has gone a step further by having the withdrawal of the film from its halls governmentally endorsed. The blasts have been variously linked with Sikh as well as Kashmiri extremism. But the most lasting ? and damaging ? fallout of these reactions has been the stances taken by the highest body in the community, the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee, and by the national commission for minorities.

 The former has objected to the use of a line from the Sikh daily prayers for the film?s title and to the depiction of a Sikh man smoking. The latter has made the entirely outrageous recommendation to the censor board that any film that might offend religious sentiments should be referred to a panel of ?religious leaders?. This pre-emptive censorship is inimical to the most fundamental tenets of democracy. A critical spirit that can engage with debate, controversy, complexity and even caricature in a rational, open-minded and balanced and, if need be, humorous manner is essential to the functioning of a healthy and mature society. The power of critique that the arts are granted by any civilized society had been shamefully denied them recently in Britain when Ms Gurpreet Kaur Bhatti?s play, Behzti, was taken off the boards in a reputed Birmingham theatre. The local Sikh community had demonstrated against it, and there were death threats against Ms Bhatti, for having depicted corruption, murder and rape in a gurdwara. Not a single British politician stood by her then. In India, such a reign of fear would be a far more unfortunate and dangerous thing.

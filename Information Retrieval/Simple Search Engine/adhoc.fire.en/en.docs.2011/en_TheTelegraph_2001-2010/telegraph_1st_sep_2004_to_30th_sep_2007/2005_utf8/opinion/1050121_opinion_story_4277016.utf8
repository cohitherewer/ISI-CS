 LEFT FOOT FORWARD

 Boca Juniors forever

El Diego

By Diego Armando Maradona, 

Yellow Jersey, pound; 16.99

Diego Maradona probably has no idea that he is one 

reason why the city of Calcutta divides into two halves ? Brazil and Argentina 

? once every four years (Pel? being the other reason). If he knew, he would surely 

have included Calcutta in his list of dedicatees for his autobiography. The list 

is one of the longest in the history of books, and includes relatives, friends, 

old clubs and even ?the lawyers who got my friend out of prison? and ?all the 

footballers of the world?.

 One does not have to go further than the second paragraph to realize that El Diego is going to be its author?s defence: ?It?s good to look back, when you feel well, when, in spite of your mistakes, you have nothing to regret. When you?ve come from the very bottom and you know that everything you?ve ever been, are, or will be is entirely due to your own struggles.? Not that the tone is unexpected. What is important is to ask whether the book becomes boring as a result. The answer is no, to a large extent. 

 What rescues El Diego from becoming a ?look-how-I-was-victimized? tale is the irreverent Dieguito who resides inside, and often comes out of, the star footballer. He doesn?t flinch from firing at influential soccer administrators and political leaders. He asks uncomfortable questions: ?Why don?t we speak the truth about Che Guevara in Argentina?? (It is doubtful, though, whether this question would have bothered him had he not been convalescing in Castro?s Cuba.) 

 But Maradona is at his most delightfully irreverent and arrogant when he comes to the infamous first goal against England in the 1986 World Cup in Mexico. ?Sometimes I think I enjoyed that one more, the first one...At the time I called it ?the hand of God?. Bollocks was it the hand of God, it was the hand of Diego! And it felt a little bit like pickpocketing the English...?

 But is this just irreverence, or arrogance? Or is it a clever ploy to justify a gross violation by going back to the old ?revenge-for-Falklands? theme? ? ?...we were defending our flag, the dead kids, the survivors. That?s why I think my goal meant so much?? In his book, Hand of God, Jimmy Burns sees this goal and the one following it ? a magical goal which has gone down forever in the annals of the game ? as symbolic. For Burns, ?the first showed Maradona the urchin child who had grown to be a star, still so unsure of his true self as to feel the need to cheat. The second showed Maradona the hugely gifted player of exceptional skill whose combination of acceleration, control, strength and accuracy translated into unrivalled greatness on the field.?

 The image of an ?urchin child? drawn impossibly away by the evil forces of the world actually helps Maradona. Every wrong turn can then be explained away in terms of a poor little rich boy?s na?vet?. Maradona knows it, and uses it. If he chooses a penniless Boca Juniors instead of a rich Riverplate, it is because of his lifelong loyalty to the former, but if he decides to go to Barcelona, it is because Argentinian football cannot afford him forever, and the money given by Barcelona as transfer fee would help them no end.

 But Diego Armando Maradona is full of contradictions. He can joke about the Korean defender who left him bleeding, but cannot forgive Cesar Menotti, one of his mentors, for dropping him in the 1978 World Cup. Reading El Diego together with something like Jimmy Burns might help to crack some of these mysteries.

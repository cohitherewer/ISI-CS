 Letters to Editor

 Unfair play

 Sir ? In the leader, ?Mad girl in a little dress? (Sept 10), the unfortunate girl from Dhenkanal and Sania Mirza seem to be placed on equal footing as victims of ?male desire for control and possession?. But the plight of the Dhenkanal girl, Annapurna Sahoo, is far worse than Sania?s. Sania has rebelled against male dominance in Muslim society, much to the anxiety of the male chauvinist clerics, a section of whom has promptly issued a fatwa on her. Sania has no idea what it is like to be locked up in a windowless room for 20 years by one?s father and then have the country?s police take the father?s side. 

 Yours faithfully,

P.K. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? In our country, a large number of aspiring and promising sportsmen and women are deprived of proper training, international exposure and infrastructural support owing to the lack of funds, sponsorship and support from the government. But the governments have no qualms about showering their largesse on sportspeople who are already quite affluent. What was the need of the Andhra Pradesh chief minister to present Sania Mirza with a cheque for Rs 20 lakh on her return from New York? Of course, Sania herself could have set a precedent by not accepting the money. She can still redeem herself by offering the amount ? which must be a fraction of what she has earned in prize money already ? to a sportsman or woman who might need it.

 Yours faithfully

Raj Bagri, Calcutta

 Sir ? Intellectual Muslims have rightly risen against the fatwa issued by some fundamentalist Islamic bodies against India?s rising tennis star, Sania Mirza, over her choice of dress. Not only Islam, but other major Indian religions advocate that girls cover their bodies adequately. Such dictates are often in the interest of the women. But exceptions have to be made for women in sports. There is nothing seriously indecent about the way Sania Mirza turns out on court. Terms like fatwa do not sit comfortably in a democratic set-up, since fundamentalists are not welcome in a democracy.

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir ? Thanks for the report, ?CM fetes Sania, forgets Humpy? (Sept 11). How can Sania Mirza be heaped with all the cash rewards while an equally, if not more, talented Koneru Humpy is forgotten? Sania has already gone on record saying that she does not require any government support. And now, when her coffers are fuller than ever with greenbacks, why doesn?t she transfer the 20 lakh she has received from the Andhra Pradesh government to Humpy?

 The sports scene in India is suddenly looking up ? with Sania, Arjun Atwal, Anju Bobby George, Soma Biswas, Sushmita Singha-Roy and others bringing medals from international events. The government must do something for the non-cricket, non-tennis stars, since the corporate sponsors cannot see beyond cricket and tennis. Bank of Baroda has recently dumped Koneru Humpy for Rahul Dravid, a cricketer who already has more endorsement contracts than he can handle. And what about our television channels? DD Sports was recently showing some 20-20 matches involving veteran Pakistanis, Sri Lankans and Indians, but failed to telecast the Asian athletics meet, or the World athletics meet, where Indian girls were winning medals for the country. When will these things change?

 Yours faithfully,

Manjul Saha, Rourkela 

 Sir ? That Indian sports fans worship glamour is no new thing. Of course, performance ? with or without consistency ? gets a sportsman into the limelight. But once in the limelight, the glamour quotient dictates everything. This has been seen time and again with cricket. Why haven?t companies fallen at the feet of V.V.S. Laxman, the holder of the Indian record for the highest test score, as they have flocked around Sachin Tendulkar or Sourav Ganguly? And now it?s Sania Mirza. Yes, her performance this year has been encouraging. But then, not half as much was generated around Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi when they actually won Grand Slam titles. Sania has only reached the fourth round of a Grand Slam. Chess is one of the few games where India has been performing consistently well. Which is why it is a shame that Koneru Humpy should be ignored by her state?s chief minister while Sania Mirza is heaped with all the material benefits. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Sir ? Discrimination between sporting disciplines is not a good thing. It looks totally absurd when a star created by the media is chosen for cash awards by a state government, while the real champion is neglected. This is one of the many reasons why India is unable to produce more than a few world-beaters from among one billion-plus people.

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? Islamic clerics have done what they felt is their duty by writing Sania Mirza off for violating the shariat dress code. It is clear that neither they, nor Islam in general, stand to gain in any way if Sania starts wearing skirts of ?proper? length from tomorrow. So it is best that the tennis star be given the liberty to heed, or ignore, the diktat of the clerics.

 Yours faithfully,

Omar Luther King, New Delhi

 Sir ? Successive Andhra governments have used the minority-appeasement card shamelessly. Is the cash award to Sania Mirza, leaving Koneru Humpy in the lurch, a new way of playing the old game?

 Yours faithfully,

Githa K., Chennai

 Letters to Editor

 A matter of faith

 Sir ? It?s both ludicrous and astonishing that the top brass of one of the country?s premier science and technology institute should seek divine help to ensure that a rocket carrying two satellites reaches outer space safely (?Space science in the lord?s hands?, May 5). The scientists may have personal faith in the almighty but even so, it is beyond comprehension why they must rely on an extraneous power for the success of a mission that is based on human ingeniousness and the power of his brain.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sharmistha Dhar, Calcutta

 It?s not just love

 Sir ? Let me attempt a simple examination of some comments Ashok V. Desai makes in ?Muhabbat-i-Musharraf? (May 3). ?The Indian army could not slip behind the Kargil heights because it would have been exposed to Pakistani shelling. That left the task largely to infantrymen climbing steep hills against fire from dug-in positions. Except that the Pakistanis could not withdraw their troops from the heights under Indian fire....On Kargil, he [Atal Bihari Vajpayee] showed himself to be a novice incapable of learning an elementary military lesson ? that it was suicidal to send infantry to take fortified hill positions.?

 If the Indian army could not slip behind the Pakistanis and infantrymen were sent in, which army were these infantrymen from? In high altitudes, only the infantry can capture and hold ground. Thus, whether they ?slipped in? or went up front, it would still be the infantry. There were multi-directional attacks also and so I reckon they did ?slip in? despite Pakistani shelling. What stopped the Pakistanis from withdrawing? Indian artillery fire? On the mountains, artillery is not that effective to pinpoint targets because many of the shells either go over or under. That is why the Bofors guns were used in direct firing and the airforce used precision-guided munitions for strikes on Tiger Hill. Desai is a greater novice than Vajpayee. If Vajpayee did not understand an ?elementary military lesson?, then how does Desai suggest we take such positions? Surely not Shivaji?s ghorpads. 

 Armchair strategists can obfuscate with rhetoric but the nitty-gritty of tactics is largely beyond them.

 Yours faithfully,

S.K. Raychaudhuri, Calcutta

 Sir ? At a time politicians and the media all over India are going ga-ga over what they see as Pervez Musharraf?s change of stance over Kashmir and promising breakthroughs in Indo-Pak relations, Ashok V. Desai is the lone voice of sanity. Desai hits the nail on the head when he says that the general ?has not given up on hostility?. Much as New Delhi would like to see a mellow Musharraf sincere about improving relations, the fact is that his present charm is no more than a facade ? the strategy of the hour. 

 A simmering dispute over Kashmir is Pakistan?s raison d??tre, something the wily general is certainly well aware of. Besides, with India on the verge of becoming a member of the United Nations security council, Pakistan has no option but to warm up to its neighbour. What remains to be seen is how long Musharraf?s facade continues.

 Yours faithfully,

Sushobhan Sarkar, Calcutta

 Sir ? Not just Pervez Musharraf, every Pakistani leader is like a wolf in sheep?s skin. None of them has forgotten the loss of Kashmir, Junagadh, Hyderabad or East Pakistan. Through militancy, infiltration and incursions, they want to take revenge on India. Thus the new cordiality in relations and the resumption of dialogue are all an eyewash. New Delhi should continue to remain alert at every moment.

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

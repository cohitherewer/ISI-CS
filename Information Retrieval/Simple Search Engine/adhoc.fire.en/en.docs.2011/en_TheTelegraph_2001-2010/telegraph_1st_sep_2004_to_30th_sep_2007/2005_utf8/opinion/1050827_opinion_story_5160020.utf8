 THE MOBILE?S A MUST

 At various moments in history, taking a train, flying on a plane and wearing a brassiere could be seen as public assertions of status or modernity. Fashion statements, in short. There is nothing left remarkable about any of these things any more ? though not wearing the last invention is still poised somewhere between fashion, politics and radical notions of comfort. That there would always remain a sizeable portion of humanity unable to afford any of these things is of their essence as commodities, however ?levelling? their eventual popularity. The transformation of a luxury into a necessity is usually a social revolution as well. And the mobile phone in India is no exception, having just completed a decade of spectacularly burgeoning use in the country. Every tenet of liberalization is vindicated by it, and the commercial possibilities are endless. In a country where socialism is still a matter of personal style, resisting a mobile phone is a form of retrochic; but even the staunchest have succumbed, and the Internationale will soon be a ringtone.

 It would not be over the top to say that the mobile phone has radically transformed the social, professional and private lives of ordinary people in a few years. It has redefined notions of access and of privacy in a big city, not only changing the pace and pitch in which life might be lived, but also bringing about a revolution in manners, in the extent to which private lives may be lived out, with varying degrees of good or bad taste, in public. Verbal intimacies, hitherto confined to intimate spaces, are now enacted in queues and escalators, shopping malls and concert-halls, as old inhibitions regarding what one allows others to hear are rapidly overcome. Thus it has become more difficult to regulate the life of the ear (what one does, or does not, wish to hear), and a retreat from the world, into undisturbed silence or music, is now virtually impossible to guarantee. A whole new world of social ?signs? ? visual as well as aural ? has come into being, as phones become increasingly ?personalized?. The Pather Panchali theme music, the latest Amit Sana number, ?Ode to Joy? or the chirping of crickets, as ringtones, become distinct personal statements, and if Chaucer had written the Canterbury Tales today, he would surely have mentioned each pilgrim?s choice of ringtone in his Prologue. With SMS, brevity becomes the soul of mindlessness (some call it the End of English), while MMS extends the horizons of mischief beyond redemption or past caring.

 Yet, in spite of the offensive and the crass, the mobile phone is triumphantly here to stay. As with all modern ?improvements?, what makes life simpler, more comfortable and less anxious is also what makes it more complicated, annoying and fraught. And the ?free? market is as much about not being left with a choice as it is about unlimited choice.

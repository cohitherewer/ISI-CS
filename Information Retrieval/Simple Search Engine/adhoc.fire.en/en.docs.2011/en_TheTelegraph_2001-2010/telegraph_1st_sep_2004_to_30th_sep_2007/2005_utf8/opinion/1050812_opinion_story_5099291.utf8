 Paperback Pickings

 A life that will be lived later

 Summer of the Cicada (Jonathan Cape, ?6.60) by Will Napier is a deeply unpleasant novel about violence and savage unhappiness in the American ?Southern Gothic? mode. (The blurbs would call it ?dark and disturbing?.) In white-picket-fenced America (somewhere in Maryland), 15-year-old Joseph Pullman is regularly and brutally beaten up by his father, while his mother gradually loses touch with reality. Joseph watches his neighbours, keeps a diary and forms an uneasy friendship with Dean Gillespie. 

 This is the summer of 1987, when the cicadas are due to come out of their 17-year hibernation, filling the air with their terrible music. Dean and Joseph keep themselves occupied burying animal corpses at the Killing Tree. Joseph believes that the cicadas will bring deliverance. Meanwhile, his father retreats to his basement workshop. Then the local boys start disappearing, to be found later unconscious in the woods. The novel opens with a coldly meticulous description of Joseph being beaten up by his father: ?First swing almost missed me. Fist came over his shoulder and I swayed back. Knuckles grazed the bridge of my nose and chin before digging into my chest. When I swayed again my foot didn?t follow back the way I?d practised. I went off-balance. Lost focus when the second punch came.?

 A Life Lived Later (Penguin, Rs 150) by Anurag Mathur is a volume of mind-numbingly bad poems that read like disastrous translations of Neruda and of second-rate ghazals. The first person dominates throughout, and mushes its way through a sort of thickening treacle of autobiographical musings. ?Does loneliness have a colour?/ I wonder.? Or, ?After the day, the worry,/ closer to the grave I hurry.? ?Who will take my pain,? wonders someone in an asylum, presumably a lunatic, ?and make with it/ monuments of modernity?? The title is explained in the last poem: ?...listen to the word/ that defines my life: Later./ Mine has been/ a life that will be lived later.? The Penguin poetry editor should take a longish sabbatical and reread most of Auden.

 Rethinking India: Toward an Indo-Us Partnership Concord (Rai Foundation, Rs 295) by Vinay Rai is further subtitled ?Changing Hearts and Mindsets?. It ?brings into sharp focus the evolving relationship between United States and India and suggests that their converging interests at this point in history hold immense potential for a strategic partnership, which will not just be mutually beneficial to both countries, but also to the world at large?. Nothing less. Rai and his research team interviewed ? more than 700 interviews over 18 months ? both American and Indian business people, journalists, politicians and policy-makers ?and of course the youth and student-strata of both sides?. The author is the chairman of Rai Foundation, which has published the book. 

The 37th Hour (Coronet, ?3) by Jodi Compton is a thriller featuring Detective Sarah Pribek, who discovers one morning that her husband has not arrived at his FBI training. And the moment she finds Shiloh?s neatly packed bag beneath their bed, she knows that he has disappeared. In many ways, it becomes a routine investigation, of the kind Sarah and her ex-partner, Genevieve, made so often ? until a brutal crime stole Genevieve?s daughter and ended her career, the kind that pries open family secrets and hidden lives. But this time the family is Sarah?s own, and her time may have run out.

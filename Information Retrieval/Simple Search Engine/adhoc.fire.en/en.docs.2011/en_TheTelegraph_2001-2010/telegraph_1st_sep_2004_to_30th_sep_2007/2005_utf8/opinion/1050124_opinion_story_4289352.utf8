 FREE IN PRIVATE 

 Anonymity can be strangely liberating. And what it liberates can be just as strangely double-edged. Call centres in India are becoming aware of an unexpected form of racism in British society. Call-centre workers in Pune trying to talk to British Telecom subscribers in Britain are having to face racist abuse on the phone when their respondents realize that they are talking to callers from India, or when they recognize Indian accents. There are some call-centre workers who have grown up in Britain without facing any explicit racism publicly, but have had to confront abuse from Britons talking from the privacy and anonymity of their homes. There seem to be, again, two Britains ? a politically corrected, merrily multicultural and tolerant ?public? civil society, and a more complicated, resentful and abusive ?private? nation that expresses itself more freely and violently on issues like immigration and outsourcing.

 The relationship between these private expressions of racism and modern forms of communication is profoundly ironic. First, it is globalization itself, and its various mobilities, which breed this racism, the blurring of the boundaries of nations, economies and work. Second, and more interestingly, the ?freedom? afforded by telephones, and then the internet, paradoxically liberates the older, and darker, attitudes. A frightening range of fascists, neo-nazis, rabid nationalists, fundamentalists and terrorists have found freedom of expression and association through the internet. Modern civilization?s most violent discontents have found forms of utterance in these virtual and almost identity-less worlds brought into being by telephones and cyberspace. Freedom, in these spaces and networks, becomes a peculiarly ambivalent thing, almost limitless and ungovernable, frustrating most attempts at legislation or policing. This is, of course, easier with the internet than with telephony. Racist abusers who use the phone may be traced, while neo-nazi or paedophilic chatrooms and their inhabitants are both dangerously real and dangerously virtual. The ?civilized? races today find, in some of the fruits of modern technology, a means of overcoming the progressive, and repressive, elements in their civilization itself when suddenly liberated from an individual identity, from a name and a face. It is only at such moments that the lost freedom of calling somebody a ?job-stealing Paki? may be experienced in all its headily forbidden thrill.

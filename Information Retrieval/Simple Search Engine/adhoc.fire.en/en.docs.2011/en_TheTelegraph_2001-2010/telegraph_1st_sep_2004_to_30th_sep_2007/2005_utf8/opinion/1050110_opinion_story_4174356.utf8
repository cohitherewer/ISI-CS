 SOME DESIGNS ARE NOT FOR EVERYONE

 AD-ON VALUE

 Could we stop playing around with the term ?designer??

 I remember a time when designer clothes were available only in France and Italy. ?Designer clothes? implied Versace, Gucci, Calvin Klein or any name that we pronounced wrong. In a few years, newspapers started advertising exhibitions where individuals would sell clothes that were their own creations. And then we had Ritu Kumar, Ritu Beri and other ?designers?. A new phenomenon began emerging in Delhi and Mumbai in the late Eighties. People started designing their own clothes, setting up boutiques and getting themselves a client?le of socialites who wanted ?something different? to wear to parties. 

 These days, however, the word ?designer? has taken on a completely new meaning. As I drive around the city, I see posters which read, ?Deejainer Jeens for only Rs 300? and ?Deezinar Bags below Rs 100?. Invitation cards flood the mailbox, announcing the latest shop to go ?designer?. Now, we can buy any product as a designer piece ? designer shoes, designer bags, designer jewellery, designer crockery, designer linen, and the list goes on. But why this obsession with using this word? 

 Do we, the consumers, know the actual implication of this word? Why is it being used as an adjective for every new shop or product? I wonder whether this is a substitute for the popular ?new and improved? formula. Or maybe, the people using this word are trying to take advantage of the public?s ignorance? 

 Most of us do not know what to classify as ?designer? and what not to. One indication used to be the price tag. If it was twenty times costlier than you would expect, then it had been created by a designer. But these days, designer clothes are available for some hundreds of rupees instead of thousands. Another way to ensure that an outfit was designer was if there were only one piece available and no one else would be caught wearing the same outfit. Now mass-produced designer clothes are being sold in chain-outlets instead of exclusive boutiques. 

 In addition, designers were well-known names and famous in their own right. Everyone envied you if you had met one personally. Now, every young girl is aspiring to be a fashion designer and wants to study in one of the numerous fashion institutes mushrooming in the city and for that matter, all over the country. It is another matter that most of them stare blankly when asked the difference between haute couture and pr?t. At a party recently, someone wearing a nice top was asked where she bought it. The answer was entirely predictable: she was a designer, and designed her own clothes. 

 Harsh as it may sound, the term ?designer? is losing its honour in the crowd. True, there are more designers in the Indian fashion scene today than ever before. But could we please leave the word alone? Take my word for it, it is safest with those who understand its real meaning.

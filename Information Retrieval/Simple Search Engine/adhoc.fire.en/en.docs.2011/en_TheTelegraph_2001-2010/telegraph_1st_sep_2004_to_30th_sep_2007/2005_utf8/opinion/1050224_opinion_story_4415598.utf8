 REMEMBER RIGHT

 A sense of irony is unavoidable every time modern Gujarat invokes the name of the Mahatma. The occasions are usually banal ? this time it is the liquor ban. Apparently prohibition is going to be relaxed in the only Indian state where it still exists. The proposed amendment seeks to introduce a human approach: instead of sending offenders to jail, they will be subjected to community service and medical treatment. Earlier, only foreigners could apply for a permit to drink, and they had to pay for it. Now they get it free, but the leftovers at the time of their leaving the state have to be returned to the authorities. It seems now that Gujarat is slowly moving towards lifting the ban altogether ? as did Andhra Pradesh, Haryana and many of the northeastern states, to their obvious fiscal gain. But the home minister of Gujarat is still keeping up the Gandhian rhetoric in insisting that this is just a humanizing of the law, and there is no question of lifting the ?four-decade-old prohibition?. The Congress has protested, also in Gandhian terms, as have veteran Gandhians.

 If the ban does get relaxed or lifted, then the reasons would be purely economic. Gujarat could well do with the revenue that liquor licenses would bring in. Manipur, Assam and Nagaland have all pulled themselves out of fiscal crises in this way. There the protests have come not from Gandhians but from women?s groups ? mostly poor rural women for whom alcoholism means domestic violence and financial ruin. Only the tribals of Chandpur in Gujarat have protested against the prohibition, reminding the state of the importance of liquor in their social and religious lives. Gujarat would be better off leaving the fate of prohibition to economic compulsions. ?In reality, there are as many religions as there are individuals,? Gandhi had written in Hind Swaraj, ?but those who are conscious of the spirit of nationality do not interfere with one another?s religion.? This, rather than the prohibitionist Gandhi, might be a better ideal for modern Gujarat.

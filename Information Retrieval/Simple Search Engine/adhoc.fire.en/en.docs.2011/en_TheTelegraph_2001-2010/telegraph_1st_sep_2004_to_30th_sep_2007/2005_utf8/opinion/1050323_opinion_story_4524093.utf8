 TOWARDS A BETTER WORLD

 Beena Sarwar

 Speaking in what she terms as her ?bad accent?, the gravel-voiced middle-aged woman with short cropped hair and glasses offers some tips for activists, or anyone who wants to make a difference. She calls them ?six Ps?.

 First, passion: ?You can?t make a difference without it. You have to realize that if something needs to be corrected, you yourself have to contribute towards it...? Next, a programme: ?You have to have clear objectives. If you don?t know where you?re going, you?re not going to get there. For me, that goal is...an independent Palestine existing alongside Israel.?

 Pragmatism: ?Women are good at that...Network, publish, get out there...Don?t be afraid of politics, sometimes you need power to make a difference.? Professionalism: ?Be the best you can be, and better. Women often have to be better to be as good as men.? Patience: ?Sometimes, you need a tremendous amount. Wait ...take advantage of the opportunity when it arrives...?

 Be pioneering, path-breaking: ?You have to have a... different perspective...When Palestinian and Israeli women first talked about...a two-state solution twenty years ago, we were thinking out of the box.? And finally, persistence: ?Don?t give up till the task is done.?

 This is Naomi Chazan, an Israeli professor and activist, speaking at a ?round table? organized by Unesco in Paris on International Women?s Day. The other panellists include a Cuban bio-chemist, a French product manager at Peugeot, and a Colombian mayor who?s working on a ?women?s political school?. I?m with a small group of journalists invited to another seminar there.

 Reaching out

 Dr Chazan is among the first to support a two-state solution in Israel. Her entry into politics was the result of a friend?s threat to tell everyone that she was a liar since she didn?t practice what she preached. Chazan went around telling other women to do something about what they believed in. So into politics she went. She found herself elected to the knesset, where she was deputy-speaker till a couple of years ago. 

 People like Chazan reinforce the need to see people not as ?representatives? of their country or religion. But for Israelis and Pakistanis, there is no such opportunity. A Pakistani passport ?is valid for all countries of the world? except Israel?. When Pakistanis and citizens of other countries who don?t have diplomatic relations with Israel go there, Israel issues visas on a separate paper so that the entry and the exit are not stamped.

 And yet, there are signs of change. An occasional debate about ?recognizing? Israel has begun in Pakistan. It surfaces every now and then, along with the more compelling economic argument for trade between our countries. Israeli leaders have even been interviewed on TV. In fact, the internet has made nonsense of state efforts to keep people of ?enemy countries? from connecting. There are several email postings, lists and websites which provide information about Israeli peace activists. Email lists lead you to websites like the liberal newspaper Haaretz or the right-wing Jerusalem Post. 

 Another source is the Israeli Peace Bloc. These groups include the elderly women who monitor Israeli military checkpoints in an attempt to make things easier for the Palestinians who are held up here every day. They call themselves Machshom Watch. Ordinary Israelis risk police brutality to shield Palestinian villagers trying to pick olives or resisting the demolition of their homes. There are the ?refuseniks? from the reserve forces who risk court martial but refuse to serve on the occupied territories. There is resistance to the monstrous dividing wall, and to the settlers? tyranny against Palestinians.

 Every country has its resistance workers, its activists working towards a better world. Recognizing them is part of the process towards that goal.

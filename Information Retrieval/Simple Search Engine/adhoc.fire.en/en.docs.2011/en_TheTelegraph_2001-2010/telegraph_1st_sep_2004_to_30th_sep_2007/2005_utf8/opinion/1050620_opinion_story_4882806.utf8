 Letters to Editor

 For some dignity and peace

 Sir ? Life and death are the two absolute realities every family experiences. The government takes notice of birth and builds ill-equipped and badly-run hospitals. But what about the other reality, death? Why is it that one crore people have only four crematoriums? Recently, I was shocked at the appalling condition of the Shiriti crematorium. Of the two furnaces, only one was in operation, leading to a lengthening queue of bodies. The delay was compounded by intermittent power cuts. And the last hopes of dignity in death were dashed by groups of locals gambling and guffawing as bodies burnt and families mourned. The seats meant for the people accompanying the dead had been usurped by the idlers. Don?t citizens of Calcutta have a right to last journeys which are peaceful, clean, dignified and quick? If the government cannot ensure this, why can?t this utility too be privatized? 

 Yours faithfully,

Sumita Banerjea, Calcutta

 Smoke gets into the eyes

 Sir ? The government?s order to ban smoking on big and small screen from October 2, 2005 is a ridiculous decision (?Smokescreen lifts, ban to kick in?, June 16). Yes, people copy filmstars in real life, and smoking poses a big health hazard. But rape is one of our biggest social evils, and incidence of rape is on the rise. So will the women and family welfare department now ban rape scenes in films and television soaps? Consumption of alcohol too poses health hazards. Will that too have to disappear now from the visual media? If the government is indeed concerned about the health of the country, shouldn?t it stop the manufacture of cigarettes and alcohol? But of course it won?t. That would mean saying no to a lot of money.

 Yours faithfully,

Mahesh Kumar, New Delhi

 Sir ? The ban on smoking scenes in films is welcome, since the statutory warning, ?Cigarette smoking is injurious to health?, has proved inadequate and ineffectual. But what about the growing vulgarity and obscenity shown in our films in the name of masala or art? Smoking affects individuals but obscenity in films affects the entire society. This is a matter of far greater concern than smoking .

 Yours faithfully,

S.A. Rahman Barkati, Calcutta

 Sir ? In the world?s largest democracy, it will not be easy for the government to enforce a ban on the country?s best-loved addiction. The media, whose favourite advertisers are tobacco companies, would not like to lose them all of a sudden. If we review the ban on smoking in public spaces, we can see how it has fallen flat, with people smoking on the pavements and bus-stops, and even inside public vehicles. If we look hard, we will also find lawmakers smoking blissfully in public places. Legal tangles in India being so impossible, few people are willing to report the offenders to the police, and the police consider smoking in a public space too trivial an offence to book individuals for it. It is for everyone to see why smoking will never be a dead practice.

 Yours faithfully,

Sumant Poddar, Calcutta

 Sir ? I took my first puff when I was studying at an all-girls college in Darjeeling. I was no movie-buff and so I did not emulate anybody from the screen to pick up the habit. Two things made me join the smoking club ? peer pressure and academic stress. Today I am thirty-two and married. I smoke about two cigarettes a day and I also take pains to eat the right type of food. My husband too smokes but only once in a while. How can the ban on smoking in films be a good policy decision when millions of young men and women like me have decided to take up smoking without any encouragement whatsoever from popular cinema? Such a ban on celluloid can only strangle artistic freedom and creativity. Smoking is an individual decision and it falls outside the domain of governmental jurisdiction. We are mature enough to decide for ourselves, the government does not have to do the thinking for us. I do not condone smoking as a habit and I support the government?s effort to stop smoking in restaurants, trains, hospitals and other public spaces, because we have no business depriving others of clean air. As a housewife, I only smoke when the family members are away from the house. But to ban it on screen does not, in my mind, serve any purpose if the government?s intention is to discourage the habit. The best way to do it is by increasing tax on all tobacco products and levying stringent fines. 

 Yours faithfully,

Ruchika Agarwal, Siliguri

 Sir ? If smoking in cinema is encouraging people to take up smoking, then there must be many elements of films which also deserve to be banned, since they damage the very ethical fibre of our lives. And soon there will be nothing suitable for viewing, except the reading of religious texts. 

 Yours faithfully,

Rabindra Nath Bhattacherjee, Durgapur

 Sir ? No one thought Ireland could conquer public smoking one day. But it has, and it did not not need to don the mantle of cultural censors for that.

 Yours faithfully,

Shikha Gomes, Calcutta

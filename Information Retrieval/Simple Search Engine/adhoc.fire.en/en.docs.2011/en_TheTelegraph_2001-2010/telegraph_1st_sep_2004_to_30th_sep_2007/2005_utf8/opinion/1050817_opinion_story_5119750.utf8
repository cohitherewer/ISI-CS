 SECURE GROUND

 Politicians thrive on managing contradictions. Mr Pranab Mukherjee has a well-deserved reputation as a troubleshooter for the Congress party. A major test of his political skills now awaits him on his home turf in Bengal. But he must diagnose the party?s ailment properly if he hopes to cure it even partially. True, the exit of Ms Mamata Banerjee had dealt the party a blow from which it never quite recovered. What sapped the party?s energies, though, long before she quit was the bitter factional rivalry among the leaders. That is where Mr Mukherjee has to start if he is to re-build the party. It cannot be unknown to him why the Congress president, Ms Sonia Gandhi, chose to re-appoint him president of the Bengal unit of the party. The choice of any other leader for the post could have worsened the factional feuds. His responsibilities as defence minister notwithstanding, Ms Gandhi had to fall back on him to try and revitalize the party in Bengal. The timing of his choice is also crucial. He has only a few months to set the party in order and face the Marxists in the next assembly elections. 

 However, the battle with the left is not really the kind of contradiction that it is made out to be. The Congress-led government at the Centre may be dependent on the left for its survival. But that should not stand in the way of a serious Congress challenge to the left supremacy in Bengal. Irrespective of the compulsions of national politics, the Congress and the left continue to be main rivals in Bengal, Kerala and Tripura. The Congress has long provided a credible alternative to the left in Kerala. In Bengal, though, the party leaders seem to have lost both their way and their will. If the Congress manages to retrieve some of its ground in Bengal, it can make two important political gains. First, a resurgent Congress may weaken Ms Banerjee?s party and thereby lure large sections of the old faithfuls back to it. More important, the gains in Bengal would help the Congress put the left in its place in national politics.

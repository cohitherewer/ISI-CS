 WHEN DEVELOPMENT SOUNDS HOLLOW

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the Human Development Report 2005

 For both China and India child mortality trends raise wider questions for public health and the distribution within developing countries of the benefits from globalization. Integration into global markets have manifestly enhanced wealth creation, generated economic dynamism and raised living standards for many millions of people in India and China. At the same time the human development benefits of economic success have been slow to trickle down to large sections of the population ? and the trickle appears to be slowing in some key areas of public health.

 Changing this picture will require public policies that address deep-rooted inequalities between rich and poor people, between men and women and between more prosperous and less prosperous regions. These inequalities are rooted in power differences ? and they are perpetuated by public policy choices. Were India to show the same level of dynamism and innovation in tackling basic health inequalities as it has displayed in global technology markets, it could rapidly get on track for achieving the millennium development goal targets. 

 There are encouraging signs that public policy may now be moving in the right direction. During 2005, the announcement of ambitious new programmes aimed at overhauling the health system and extending services in poor areas appeared to mark a new direction in policy. Economic success has expanded the financial resources available for these programmes ? and some states have shown that rapid progress can be achieved. The challenge is to ensure that effective reform takes root in the states and areas that account for the bulk of India?s human development deficit.

 Child mortality is intimately linked to maternal mortality. More than 15 years after the world?s governments launched a Safe Motherhood Initiative, an estimated 530,000 women die each year in pregnancy or childbirth. These deaths are the tip of an iceberg. At least 8 million women a year suffer severe complications in pregnancy or childbirth, with grave risks to their health. As with child mortality, the vast majority of these deaths occur in developing countries, with south Asia (where the maternal mortality ratio is 540 deaths per 100,000 live births) and Sub-Saharan Africa (where the ratio is 920 per 100,000 live births) accounting for 75 per cent of the total. The risk of dying from pregnancy-related causes ranges from 1 in 18 in Nigeria to 1 in 8,700 in Canada. And as with child mortality, most deaths are avoidable: around three-quarters could be prevented through low-cost interventions. Despite this, overall levels of maternal mortality appear to have changed little over the past decade, especially in the majority of countries that account for the bulk of deaths. Underreporting and misreporting of maternal death make cross-country comparisons and precise trend analysis difficult. However, proxy indicators ? such as fertility rates and attendance by skilled health workers ? indicate that the annual decline in mortality is slowing.

 Child health and maternal health are barometers for other areas of human development: the state of public health, the state of nutrition and the empowerment of women, among others. Failures in public health provision are reflected in the fact that the lives of about 6 million children?s lives a year could be saved through simple, low-cost interventions.

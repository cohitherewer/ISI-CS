 LIBERALS AND THE IRRATIONAL

 For hedonism?s sake

 Themes and Variations

 By Amalendu Das Gupta,

 Papyrus, Rs 250

 There was nothing unusual in one of the brightest alumni of the English literature class of the University of Calcutta opting for a career in journalism. What set Amalendu Das Gupta apart was the area of his concentration. He, a literature man, was the first-ever science correspondent of an Indian daily newspaper, winning several laurels, including a stint with the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna. His forte has always been a particular clarity of thought, matched by a similar clarity of expression. Besides, in whatever he writes, he goes straight to the heart of the matter, any matter. 

 Das Gupta retired as editor of The Statesman in 1986. He has now put together, in book form, a selection of articles he wrote for the paper both before and after retirement; some other pieces, published elsewhere, are also included. The selection covers a diversity of themes, arranged in four parts: (i) Hastening the End, (ii) Politics of the Bomb, (iii) Science and Beyond, and finally, (iv) A Miscellany. The taxonomy, while understandable, is rendered somewhat irrelevant by a dense texture of reasoning that keeps the pieces together. A structure built on reason, Das Gupta seems to imply, has a moral validity; the criterion for judging the worthwhileness of an object or proposition is the presence or absence of a rational basis. Overtly or otherwise, he hawks this morality around in nearly each of his essays. Deeply suspicious of the ambience of consumerism that globalization has of late spawned: the phenomenon, he feels, is hedonism for hedonism?s sake, no underpinning of rationality supports the insensate desire for acquisition and further acquisition.

 Given his faith in a system of values, he cannot but hate cant. Writing as early as August 1991, he has no hesitation in offering the following comment on a much-touted conventional wisdom: ?The Indian Left used to be chastised for blind subservience to Soviet policies; for well over a year it is the Right which has insisted that we must follow Mr Gorbachov?s (sic) example regardless of the appalling problems thrown up by the Soviet and East European reforms.? Or consider the forthrightness with which he formulates the contrast between the dilemma the Soviet Union and its comradely regimes in East Europe were facing and the predicament of the under-developed world: ?how a socialist society should be organised is less relevant to Third World Communists than how it can be established?.

 The moral streak in him refuses to be reconciled with Deng Xiaoping?s apparent unconcern for the colour of the cat as long as it catches the mice: the fate of the Soviet Union and the more recent developments in China, Das Gupta is convinced, indicate that the issue cannot be shoved under the carpet with such easy disdain. It is, to him, the old tussle between ends and means. The theme returns in a few other pieces too, specially in ?Values and Excellence? and ?Religiosity of the Irreligious?. As is only to be expected, Das Gupta wades with easy assurance through the frontier problems of science, religion and morality. A number of essays deal with contemporary political realities at home and overseas. Even in these discussions, the moral position remains unchanged. Das Gupta rips through the hocus-pocus of nuclear non-proliferation; he discusses with equal dispassion American fantasies like the Strategic Defence Initiative, the race over delivery systems and the Pakistani bomb. He comes down heavily on Rajiv Gandhi?s pretension in sermonizing to a group of serious-minded scientists on a topic clearly beyond his depth. He makes fun of an academic who wants to improve the quality of English taught in the country by quoting a sample of the English the gentleman has authored.

 On his familiar territory, he discusses with great elegance the strides science has made on account of the contributions of Galileo, Newton and Einstein. With a trace of cynicism, he recounts the meanderings of Stephen Hawking in search of that elusive character, god. Das Gupta?s little piece on the tribe of intellectuals has an amusing relevance at this moment when, over here, even football players and fashion models are straining to be part of the crowd. 

 This collection reveals a greatly worried man, a man who is distressed at the ongoing spectacle of irrational behaviour in the name of modernity. It is a commentary on the current state of affairs that this person, who has spent his life within the confines of what is essentially the liberal establishment, now finds himself supporting many of the causes endorsed by that far-out socialist radical, Fidel Castro.

 To sum up, it is a civilizing volume. Unfortunately, the number of those who are ?civilizable? is rapidly diminishing in the neighbourhood. Das Gupta should have no fear, there will be no run on his book at airport bookshops.

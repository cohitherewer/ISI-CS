 STEPPING LATE

 The state rarely reaches out to those living on the margins. No wonder that the Assam government failed to prevent the ethnic carnage in Karbi Anglong district. Yet, there were grave warnings in the weeks preceding the killings. The tension between the Karbi and the Dimasa tribes had been simmering for a long time. And, it burst out in bloody confrontations sporadically. But, for the ministers and officials in Dispur, the district was too far and, more important, the people too poor to matter. The result was a horrifying massacre of 35 Karbis who were dragged out of the bus they were travelling in. Two images linger from the gory scene ? one of the helpless victims and the other of a clueless and uncaring administration. It has since been known that the government finds it difficult to persuade officers to take up assignments in the forest-covered district. Obviously, the administration does not care to press the officers too hard. Worse, there is an attempt to cover up the government?s failure with the argument that the tribals would keep killing each other, no matter what the government did. It reflects the cynicism that has become the signature of the bureaucracy in most parts of India. 

 The aftermath of such tragedies shows up the cynicism of the politicians as well. They will go through the ritual of visiting the victims? families, distributing relief material, blaming the party of the government and trying to seek political mileage for their own parties. There will also be sermons from New Delhi on how to prevent such tragedies in future. The Union home minister, Mr Shivraj Patil, identified the problem well enough when he said that ?political steps? must accompany the security measures in tackling the tribal tension in Karbi Anglong. The question remains as to why neither he nor Assam?s chief minister, Mr Tarun Gogoi, had thought of the political measures before the killings happened. Instead of trying to find excuses which will convince no one, Mr Gogoi must take action against the state police chief and others directly responsible for the administrative failure. And, the government must work overtime to make up for lost time and reach out not only to the tribals in Karbi Anglong but also to other ethnic groups. But politics of the wrong kind can make things worse. It would be dangerous if politicians tried to exploit the ethnic hostilities for partisan gains.

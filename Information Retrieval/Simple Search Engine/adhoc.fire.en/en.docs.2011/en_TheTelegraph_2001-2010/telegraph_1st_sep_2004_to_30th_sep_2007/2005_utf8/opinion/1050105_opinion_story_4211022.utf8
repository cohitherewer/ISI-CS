 RURAL PUSH

 The idea of PURA ? provision of urban facilities in rural areas ? originated with the president and has been adopted by the United Progressive Alliance. Witness its explicit mention in this year?s budget. While nothing significant has materialized in 2004-05, the budget for 2005-06 is expected to provide incentives for PURA. That India?s 600,000 villages are deprived of social and physical infrastructure is evident. PURA visualizes four forms of connectivity ? road transport and power connectivity, electronic connectivity, knowledge connectivity and market connectivity. Reportedly, courtesy the Planning Commission, 504 nodal towns have already been identified under PURA and every year, 826 clusters of villages will be earmarked for integrating into these 504 nodes, each cluster consisting of 10 to 15 villages. Over a five-year period, 4,130 clusters of villages will thus be integrated and these four forms of connectivity provided. Given the UPA?s emphasis on the rural sector, the idea seems eminently attractive. Nor can anyone deny that these four forms of connectivity are desirable. However, caveats are in order. 

 Had the existence of government programmes guaranteed rural development, rural India would have been transformed as such programmes have been in existence since the industrial policy resolution of 1948. That this has not happened can be attributed to the questionable nature of government intervention and the inefficiency of public expenditure. Every year, upwards of Rs 75,000 crore is spent in the name of rural development, with questionable improvements in outcomes. How is PURA expenditure, to be channelled through the rural development ministry, going to be any different? Granted that these four forms of connectivity are desirable, is public expenditure the best means to ensure this? The government will argue that PURA will be through public-private partnerships and indeed, this clich?d expression also occurs in the budget speech of 2004-05. However, that is not how the government seems to be contemplating PURA. In electronic, knowledge and market connectivity, there is no evidence of what economists call market failure. Stated differently, PURA?s cause might be better served if the government were to concentrate on road transport and power connectivity alone.

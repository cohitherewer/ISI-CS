 Spiritual India?

 While it?s true that Indian modernity, as we know it, is concomitant and congruent with colonialism, it?s also true that the construction of ?Indianness?, or ?being Indian?, in that period transcends, complicates and makes fluid the fixed identity of the colonial subject. In what way, and how, did ?being Indian? become a point of departure from all sorts of more specific marks and occlusions towards a seemingly transparent, absolute, spontaneous human identity?

 The question hasn?t been adequately answered. At what point in the 19th century, for instance, did a person in India reading either Tagore, or Shakespeare, or the Bhagavad Gita, or Tom Paine, or an editorial in a newspaper, become someone who was reading not only as a colonial subject, or an upper-caste or upper-class Hindu, or as an aristocratic Muslim, but as an ?Indian?? How was it that being ?Indian? was to possess a national identity but also to be ?human?, and, in an unexpected sense, to be at one with the colonizer? This category ? ?Indianness? ? was an extraordinary invention; in its double location in the national and political on the one hand, and in the universal and human on the other, it was at once oppositional and closed and receptive and open-ended; it provided the basis for resistance to the colonizer and, on another level, an intriguing empathy with him. This empathy came not just from submission and acquiescence (submission, anyway, leads to mimicry, not empathy), but the translation, through the cognitive basis of ?being Indian?, of the self from colonial subject to ?universal? human being.

 This ? and not just class elitism ? is what gives Indian modernity, in the 19th and early 20th centuries, its dislocating, distinctive note of confidence and its magpie-like instinct toward intellectual entitlement; the note is audible, and that instinct manifest in this statement that Tagore made in a letter to C.F. Andrews, which Sen quotes in his book: ?Whatever we understand and enjoy in human products instantly becomes ours, wherever they might have had their origin.? 

 In 1816, the conservative Indian founders of the Hindu College, asking the Chief Justice Edward Hyde East to set up an institution in Calcutta that would provide Indians a European education, and being asked, in turn, by Hyde East if this wouldn?t upset traditional sensitivities, said ? the sentiment and note of confidence look forward to Tagore?s ? that they wished to take from Europe ?that which they found good and liked best?. By 1816, then, presumably, the ?universal human being? had emerged in India, side by side with, and subsuming, the early colonial subject; for these gentlemen, otherwise conservative by nature ? they had marginalized Rammohun Roy from this very initiative for being too radical ? spoke not only as native opportunists, but as human beings exercising judgment in a context where such judgment had come into play.

 This note of confidence is seldom heard in Western modernism, despite its cosmopolitanism and its reputation for radical experiment; although the Western modern has done, in relation to non-European culture, exactly what the Indian wanted to do in relation to the European, that is, taken what it ?thought good and liked best? (one thinks of Van Gogh?s Japanese prints and Picasso?s African mask). The non-European is silently domesticated and naturalized in the space of European modernity; the latter is shaped by a secret sense of the ?other? in a way that Indian modernity isn?t. The note of confidence and celebratory entitlement we hear in Tagore and the founders of the Hindu College is, perhaps for this reason, absent from Western modernism; but it?s possibly present in other modernities. Certainly, its most powerful expression comes from Borges in ?The Argentine Writer and Tradition?: ?I believe our tradition is all of Western culture, and I also believe we have a right to this tradition, greater than that which the inhabitants of one or another Western nation might have.?

 Amartya Sen himself, by this Indian definition, is a ?late modern?; although deeply anti-colonial (as, indeed, many of the Indian artistic and intellectual elite were, including Tagore), he?s marked by a particular kind of confidence in relationship to European and other cultures that places him in the line of the founders of the Hindu College; and, in spite of his concern with placing Indian rationality and science within their own cultural traditions, seems unaffected by the nostalgia for an uncontaminated, indigenous modernity that secretly impels some of the most acute of post-colonial thinkers. What he has to say may not be as ground-breaking as the work of these writers has occasionally been; but his book rumbles, despite its civility, with a private and timely discontent that reminds us that the problem of Indian modernity and humanism needs to be examined afresh; that, if Indian modernity is a way of viewing the world, we haven?t scrutinized, enough, the gaze in the mirror.

 In one regard, I?d modulate Sen?s thesis. Sen draws our attention to the two world-views that have invented a ?spiritual? India: that of Europe and, closer to home, of Hindutva. But there is a third, more imaginatively significant invention of Indian spirituality; it comes from the rational, humanist, secular middle class whose archetypal representative Sen calls the ?argumentative Indian?. The romantic creation of a spiritual India has been crucial to secular Indian moderns, to their paradoxical, poetic sense of rootedness in, and exile from, the country they belong to. Sen quotes with approval the social scientist Partha Chatterjee?s discussion of the emergence of a ?domain of the spiritual? in India: ?anticolonial nationalism creates its own domain of sovereignty within colonial society well before its battle with the imperial power. It does this by dividing the world of social institutions and practices into two domains ? the material and the spiritual. The material is the domain of the ?outside?, of the economy?of science and technology?where the West has proved its superiority. The spiritual, on the other hand, is an ?inner? domain bearing the ?essential? marks of cultural identity. The greater one?s success in imitating Western skills in the material domain, the greater the need to preserve the distinctiveness of one?s spiritual culture.?

 This is very persuasive. But there is another powerful reason for the creation of a ?domain of the spiritual? in India, as there is in the West: the disappearance or passing of its old locations in religion. The new domain of the spiritual that emerges, then, is something called ?culture?, and it is integral, not antithetical, to the emergence of secular modernity. This explains why key national figures who have transgressed orthodox religious denominations, like Gandhi and Tagore, are marked by residues of the old domain of religion while actually inhabiting the domain of culture, why they have a saint-like air while being political strategists or secular artists. The narrative of ?spiritual India? will have to do without its most productive incarnation if we only look for it in Western representation, or in Hindutva revisionism, and neglect the space it occupies in the secular subconscious and dreamscape.

 Letters to Editor

 Other uses of military green

 Sir ? While admitting that the Maidan needs to be saved, I fail to see the point in the army?s efforts at gratuitous social service simply because of an archaic British regulation that put Fort William in charge of the Maidan (?Green vs rallies?, Dec 28). Surely the Eastern Command has more important things to do than keeping rallyists at bay? The army chief must immediately ensure that the Eastern Command has nothing to do any more with the Maidan controversy. Why, the army already has the greening project within the Fort William precincts to think of. In fact, the Vijay Chowk area with its adjoining garden could be thrown open to the public on certain days of the week. 

 Yours faithfully,

J.K. Dutt, Calcutta

 For want of a job

 Sir ? Eleven labourers from Malda were buried alive while digging the basement for a shopping mall in New Delhi (?Malda workers die building Delhi mall?, Dec 25). They were on a fifty-day contract with a construction company and had to shift base to Delhi. Like so many other states, Bengal could not provide them with work. According to reports, an engineer had asked the workers to dig the corners despite their warnings, and then left the site. There were no supervisers either. Such accidents reflect the lack of safety measures at construction sites, even when so many workers are working under 50 feet. Safety takes a backseat when business becomes the priority. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

 Sir ? The fact that a mound of earth caved in while labourers from North Bengal were digging in a Delhi construction site proves that the usual safety norms were not being followed. One wonders where the officials of Delhi?s municipal corporation were when the digging was taking place. It has been revealed that the labourers from Malda were working on a daily wage of Rs 60 only. The West Bengal government should be ashamed that people from the state are forced to go as far as Delhi in search of work, that too for such meagre wages and under such inhuman conditions. 

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

 Sir ? The flouting of norms in Delhi that cost 11 lives only mirrors the state of affairs elsewhere. Besides granting compensation to the families of the victims, the Delhi government should initiate stern measures to punish the builders and contractors of the construction project where the labourers were working. All governments should monitor construction work through independent organizations, while conducting regular inspections of their own. 

 Yours faithfully,

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? The employers of the Bengali labourers killed in Delhi, along with the state government, are giving a total of Rs.2.50 lakh to the familes of the dead. But the government of West Bengal ? responsible in the first place for their leaving the state ? has nothing to offer except 12 kilograms of rice to each family and the cost of the last rites. 

 Yours faithfully,

S.S. Almal, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir ? My spirits soared after reading ?Water flows back to India? (Dec 7). Here is a woman ? Deepa Mehta ? who never says die. It surprised me when she left the scene timidly after Hindu fundamentalists stopped the shooting of her film in Varanasi. But, of course, it was a strategic withdrawal, only to bounce back later. I just wish directors like Mehta would also do films about the evil practices of Western societies.

 Yours faithfully,

S.B. Gupta, Calcutta

 HOME LEAVE

 Going by past record, it could be said that Indo-Pak relations have never had it so good. After bickering, cross-border terrorism, a mini war in Kargil and a failed summit in Agra, now buses are plying, peace talks are progressing and the Pakistan president, Mr Pervez Musharraf, has had a very successful visit to India. There has also been a definite decline in cross-border terrorism sponsored by Pakistan. Both India and Pakistan have good reasons to be happy, and Washington must also be smiling with the palpable fall in tension in south Asia. The surprise icing on the cake is the invitation extended by Mr Musharraf to Mr L.K. Advani, the president of the Bharatiya Janata Party, to visit Pakistan. Mr Advani accepted the invitation with alacrity and is already on Pakistani soil. Mr Advani, when he was home minister in the National Democratic Alliance government, had earned for himself the reputation of being a hawk on Pakistan. Many people believed that he was responsible for the failure of the Agra summit. Reputation and notoriety both have the propensity of outstripping reality. Mr Advani was no more a hawk or a dove than the rest of his party and government. If Mr Advani appears to be an unlikely candidate to receive an official invitation to visit Pakistan, it is because he has been a lifelong member of a political and ideological formation which is known for its hatred of Muslims. Mr Musharraf?s invitation and Mr Advani?s acceptance of it are both measures of the goodwill that currently exists between India and Pakistan.

 Mr Advani is too seasoned a politician not to realize that he is not going to Pakistan as an individual. He is going as the president of the BJP and, more importantly, as the representative of the people of India. He has to be more conscious of his ps and qs than he has ever been. It is true that Mr Advani is not on a diplomatic mission since he is no longer a member of the government. In fact, his trip is endowed with something more significant. His is a mission of goodwill: his reactions and utterances will inform the future relationship between the people of India and the people of Pakistan. Mr Advani travels with the baggage of being a Muslim-hater. He has to combat this prejudice to impress the people he meets in Pakistan. For the person, Mr Advani, as distinct from the politician, the trip will be a sentimental journey to the city where he was born.

 INSIDE STORY

 The Reserve Bank of India?s Annual Report for 2004-05 does not say anything unexpected, and is in line with its earlier annual monetary policy statement. The good news is part internal, while the bad news is external, centred around high and uncertain global oil prices. Despite India?s openness, the RBI rightly thinks that there are enough internal sources of growth to neutralize global uncertainties. Not only will foreign exchange reserves, current account receipts and capital account inflows provide enough cushion against a widening trade deficit, but the RBI also thinks that macro-conditions are favourable for reducing import duties to a uniform rate of 10 per cent (excluding agriculture).

 Revival of the monsoon, manufacturing growth, corporate profitability, buoyant equity markets, growth in exports (and imports), demand for non-food credit, stable bank-lending rates and high service-sector growth are the drivers behind the RBI?s projection of 7 per cent real GDP growth in 2005-06. If anything, the RBI seems somewhat skeptical about traditional agriculture?s role in contributing to both growth and employment, although points are made about agricultural credit and diversification. Annual inflation projections at between 5 to 5.5 per cent are also reasonable, subject to any additional pressures resulting from higher domestic oil prices. Indeed, the Central Bank does not mince words in arguing for increase in domestic petroleum-product prices, both on grounds of greater energy efficiency and fiscal pressures.

 Given present deficit figures, there is legitimate skepticism about the revenue deficit being eliminated in 2008-09. However, since Central banks tend to be cautious, there are caveats about petroleum price increases contributing to increased inflation, taken in conjunction with the diagnosis about excess domestic liquidity. If one reads between the lines, this can be interpreted as possible future hikes in interest rates. But as of now, this interpretation seems premature. The RBI simply seems to be warning the government that inability to hike domestic petroleum prices will erode profitability of oil companies and become a binding fiscal constraint, especially because high global oil prices have a large permanent component and are not transient. The favourable macro-environment, to which yuan appreciation also contributes, is therefore the right time to introduce further liberalization. This is no quarrel with this. The Annual Report also highlights inadequate spread of the banking sector, with limited access by deprived segments and groups, and increased capital requirements by banks to comply with Basel-II norms. On such banking reforms, the RBI should be more forthright about what will be done.

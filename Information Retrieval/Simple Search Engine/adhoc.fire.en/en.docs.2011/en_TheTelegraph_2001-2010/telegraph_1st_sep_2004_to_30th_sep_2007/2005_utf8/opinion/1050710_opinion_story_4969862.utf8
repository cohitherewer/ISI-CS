 OTHER SIDE OF EMPIRE

 The British Empire never fails to evoke strong emotions. Britons are nostalgic about the time when Britannia ruled the waves, when, according to a strand of historiography harking back to the days of James Mill and Thomas Babington Macaulay, paladins of empire carried civilization to the colonies. Indians ? and others who fought to free themselves from British imperial rule ? have always been critics of the impact of British rule on the former colonies. This battle ? empire versus nationalism ? is old and even perhaps irrelevant because it has been lost and won. Former colonies of the raj are today?s proud nation-states. Mr Manmohan Singh spoke to his Oxford audience, while accepting an honorary doctorate from his alma mater, as a representative of a proud nation who could look back on the Indo-British encounter from a distance and with a measure of objectivity.

 Empire invariably has economics as its underpinning. The British Empire in India was no exception. The British came to India to trade and to make money. Even the project to civilize Indians had an economic motive. It was believed in the first half of the 19th century that Indians educated in English and Western ways of life would serve as markets for British products. It has been argued that even the decision to escape from empire was prompted by the realization that India was no longer paying, it was proving to be an expensive colony to keep. Nationalist historiography from the time of Dadabhai Naoroji and R.C. Dutt has always argued that the economic motives of empire worked against the interests of India and Indians.

 The economic argument and Mr Singh?s very judicious weighing of the pros and cons of empire leave out one extremely important aspect of British rule in India. The raj was in its origins an act of conquest. It was born of violence. It could only be maintained through violence whenever there was a challenge to British dominance. British rule failed to win the consent of Indians who always remained subjects and never became citizens. This was the paradox of British rule: it taught Indians about citizenship but never granted it to them. This failure to grant citizenship was rooted in the perception the British had of themselves as conquerors, as a superior people. The real challenge to British rule thus came from a man who turned violence on its head and questioned the moral right of the British to rule India. That man was, of course, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.

 British historians for understandable reasons have never quite given Gandhi his due. But with violence now stalking their own capital and country, it might be worth pondering the value of Gandhi?s message of non-violence. Mr Singh, when he condemned the violence that rocked London on Thursday, could have made the point that the best long-term antidote to violence comes from the message of a man who trained to be a lawyer in the Inner Temple in London. The violence of empire produced its own antithesis.

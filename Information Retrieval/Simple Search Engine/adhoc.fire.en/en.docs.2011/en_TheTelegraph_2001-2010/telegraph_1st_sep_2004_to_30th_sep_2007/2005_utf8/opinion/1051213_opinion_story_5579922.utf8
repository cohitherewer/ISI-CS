 CHILDREN OF A LESSER GOD

 Soviet Union may have had a special relationship with India, but the feelings of new Russia are entirely different, writes Jyoti Malhotra

 All rage

 The award for keeping the best foreign policy story continually on the boil must arguably go to Jagat Singh, the 36-year-old son of the former external affairs minister, K. Natwar Singh, and Congress MLA from Lachhmangarh, Rajasthan, who has single-handedly made Paul Volcker a household name in India. But if Natwar Singh reminds you of King Lear, then young Jagat Singh is definitely a wannabe Machiavelli. A defiant script, plotted and planned for the father by the son has completely fallen apart.

 Meanwhile, it seems only the story ? which went entirely unreported in India ? about the Russian Orthodox Church calling the Hindu god Krishna a ?devilish abomination? can hold a candle to the Natwar Singh debacle. The story unfolded last week exactly the same time as the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, was taking in the air at the Red Square in Moscow. But the Indian embassy, run by the former foreign secretary, Kanwal Sibal, kept the news far away from a forever hungry media bored stiff with the possible lease of two nuclear submarines and an intellectual property rights agreement on the joint purchase and production of Russian armaments.

 It turns out that Archbishop Nikon (no relation with the Japanese camera company) of the Russian Orthodox Church in the largely Muslim state of Bashkorkostan, wrote a letter to the Moscow mayor, Yuri Luzhkov, about ten days ago, criticizing his decision to allow the Krishna Consciousness movement, aka Iskcon, to build a temple to Krishna in the heart of Moscow.

 This is how Nikon began his letter to Luzhkov: ?How can you allow [Iskcon] to build a temple to the idolatrous, vile and malicious God Krishna?this is an insult to our religious feelings, this is a mockery of the religious millennial culture of Russia (and) suppressing the feeling of the majority population?this Krishna, malicious demon, the personification of infernal forces???

 Nikon?s angst is, of course, wonderful grist to the sangh parivar mill, which is trying to live down Uma Bharti?s latest antics. But even if you disregard the ?pseudo-secular silence? from the rest of India, you have to admit that the Russian priest?s diatribe is not only shocking and uncalled for, it also smacks of an underlying racism against the ?black and brown third world? that had been suppressed when the Soviet Union was alive, and which is finally finding breathing space in new Russia.

 There was a lot that was wrong with the Soviet Union, and there can be no questions about that. But the ?dictatorship of the proletariat? ensured a certain public morality which meant there could be no public display of religious feeling or at least nothing insulting to non-Christian believers. It was common knowledge that despite the Russification of the central Asian republics or even the largely Muslim republics such as Bashkorkostan or Tatarstan, polygamy continued to be practised. The point being made here is that minority religions like Islam or Judaism may not have been allowed a public presence, but believers were never openly humiliated for their faith.

 In new Russia, on the other hand, Jews are fair game. Skinheads are rampant in Moscow, even attacking dark-skinned diplomats. Anyone who isn?t white or blue-eyed is accused of being an ?Azerbaijani?, a pejorative term akin to ?nigger?. The rapid descent of Russia from being one of the most egalitarian nations in the world to one where the religious right is often seen to be joining hands with racist thugs, is one of the saddest stories ever.

 What, then, of the ?special? Indo-Russian relationship? The truth is that this is a partnership that has grown so staid and predictable over the past decades that it is currently unable to withstand the flashy and intoxicating interest of the all-powerful Americans. Moreover, in the new world order, the Russians themselves are struggling to maintain their position in the top five. As for India, the memory of Soviet help in the 1971 war is so thin for millions of young Indians that it would be easy to create a horrifying portrait of Russia with the unedifying comments of Archbishop Nikon.

 Not that Indians are not doing well in Russia. One non-resident Indian has set up a complex of restaurants in the heart of Moscow, and it includes the only cigar bar in town. A number of Indian men are said to be much more solicitous towards Russian women than the blonde-and-blue-eyed ones. Other businessmen have moved out of the Moscow-St Petersburg golden parallel to the great Russian interior to make the kind of money they wouldn?t dream of elsewhere.

 And yet, India and Russia are currently locked in a rather undiplomatic argument over visas for Indians going to Russia. If you don?t have a contact in the Russian embassy, it could take you a minimum of three months to get a visa to travel to that wonderful country of golden domes. What is worse is that once you land in Sheremetyevo or Domodyedovo airports in Moscow, you are likely be treated so shabbily that you wish you hadn?t taken that wonderful flight. It is believed that when the great Indian IT icon, N.R. Narayana Murthy, landed in one of these airports last year to participate in a technology park, he was asked to stand aside. The wait lasted some 45 minutes. The story goes that Narayana Murthy was so upset that he decided to turn right back and catch the next plane to Germany.

 Russian immigration, in fact, has a list of ?undesirable aliens?, and India is on that list. Russian officials argue that they have to take strict action because thousands of people commonly use the Russian route to go to western Europe. Once in Europe, they throw away their passports, but they are pushed back by Europe into Russia. Russia, in turn, wants to send these people back to where they belong.

 Of course, the Russians have a point. The villages of Punjab are being steadily depleted of men who willingly throw large sums of money at agents for a passport and a visa to Russia. These men in shiny suits land in Sheremetyevo, speaking a desi Punjabi that no self-respecting Russian immigration officer would dare countenance. That?s when the frustration slowly yields to anger.

 So what?s the solution? No one really knows, but one thing is certain. Archbishop Nikon certainly doesn?t have any of the answers.

 GUIDELINES FOR AN ACTION PLAN 

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the government of India?s status report on Disaster Management in India, published in August 2004

 The broad features of the draft national policy on disaster management are enunciated below:

 i) A holistic and proactive approach towards prevention, mitigation and preparedness will be adopted for disaster management.

 ii) Each ministry/department of the Central/ state government will set apart an appropriate quantum of funds under the plan for specific schemes/ projects addressing vulnerability reduction and preparedness. 

 iii) Where there is a shelf of projects, projects addressing mitigation will be given priority. Mitigation measures shall be built into the on-going schemes/ programmes

 iv) Each project in a hazard prone area will have mitigation as an essential term of reference. The project report will include a statement as to how the project addresses vulnerability reduction.

 v) Community involvement and awareness generation, particularly that of the vulnerable segments of population and women, have been emphasized as necessary for sustainable disaster risk reduction. This is a critical component of the policy since communities are the first responders to disasters and, therefore, unless they are empowered and made capable of managing disasters...external support cannot lead to optimal results.

 vi) There will be close interaction with the corporate sector, non-govern-mental organisations and the media in the national efforts for disaster prevention/vulnerability reduction.

 vii) Institutional structures/appropriate chain of command will be built up and appropriate training imparted to disaster managers at various levels to ensure coordinated and quick response at all levels; and development of inter-State arrangements for sharing of resources during emergencies. 

 viii) A culture of planning and preparedness is to be inculcated at all levels for capacity building measures.

 ix) Standard operating procedures and disaster management plans at state and district levels as well as by relevant Central government departments for handling specific disasters will be laid down.

 x) Construction designs must correspond to the requirements as laid down in relevant Indian Standards.

 xi) All lifeline buildings in seismic zones III, IV amp; V, hospitals, railway stations, airports/airport control towers, fire station buildings, bus stands major administrative centres, will need to be evaluated and, if necessary, retro-fitted.

 xii) The existing relief codes in the States will be revised to develop them into disaster management codes/manuals for institutionalizing the planning process with particular attention to mitigation and preparedness.

 xiii) To promote international cooperation in the area of disaster response, preparedness, and mitigation in tune with national strategic goals and objectives....

 The States of Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh have States Policies for Disaster Management in place while other States are in process. 

 ...The States have been advised to enact Disaster Management Acts. These Acts provide for adequate powers for authorities coordinating mitigation, preparedness and response as well as for mitigation/prevention measures required to be undertaken. Two States, Gujarat and Bihar, have already enacted such a law. Other States are in the process...

 In line with the changed approach, the State governments have also been advised to convert their Relief Codes into Disaster Management Codes by building into it the process necessary for drawing up disaster management and mitigation plans as well as elements of preparedness apart from response and relief. A committee constituted under the executive director, National institute of Disaster Management, has drafted a Model Disaster Management Code which is being circulated to the States so as to assist them in this process. Some States have constituted committees to revise the codes as per government of India guidelines. The revised codes will ensure that the process of drawing up disaster management plans, mitigation and preparedness measures get institutionalized.

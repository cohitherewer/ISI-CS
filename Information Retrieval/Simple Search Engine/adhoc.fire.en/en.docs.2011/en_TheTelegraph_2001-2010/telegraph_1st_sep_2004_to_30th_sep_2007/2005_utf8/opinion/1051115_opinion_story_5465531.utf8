 THE PROFILE DOES NOT MATCH

 In a new age Congress, neither Natwar Singh nor his anachronistic foreign policy is likely to find support, writes Mahesh Rangarajan

 Out of touch

 In his book, Profiles and Letters, K. Natwar Singh recounted his conversation with Indira Gandhi on the eve of his joining the Congress. ?I told her that I was shortly leaving for Bharatpur to start politicking. My first priority would be to acquire a new wardrobe, khadi kurta, Jawahar jacket, the Congress livery. Her reaction was, ?Now that you are coming into politics, a thicker skin would be more useful?.? 

 If Singh?s repeated references to his ?controlled indignation? at the recent allegations is any index, Indira Gandhi?s advice does not seem to have been met with full compliance, although it was received quite seriously. As he exited the ministry of external affairs, Singh did not even get the usual chance to call on the Congress president, Sonia Gandhi. 

 The past should show why the Congress has cause for anxiety. Rajiv Gandhi never quite managed to convince voters, especially in north India, that his government?s hands were clean on Bofors. In just two years, the issue helped unify a divided and leaderless opposition and oust the Congress from office. The Narasimha Rao government also weathered many scandals. Ministers were implicated in various deals and the Harshad Mehta episode made sure the prime minister did not escape the taint of scandal either. 

 In the present case, the minister?s survival strategy was simple enough. As he came under a cloud, Singh?s rhetoric went off at a tangent from government policy ? that Iraq?s new government lacked legitimacy. He used strong terms to condemn the invasion of Iraq. The straw that broke the camel?s back came at a Confederation of Indian Industry function, where he said he would advise the government to rethink its vote on Iran. 

 When in trouble, the Congress reaches out for its strong credentials as an opponent of imperialism. The circumstances call for a closer look. The job of opposing the United States of America has long been ceded to the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and other left parties. Whatever it is, the Congress is not set to follow the Marxists, especially on foreign policy. 

 Natwar Singh?s stance helped seal the case for his exit. Indo-US engagement has broken new grounds in recent years. Much of this had to do with the long-term consequences of the economic reforms of the Nineties. They have transformed the image of India among strategists, political leaders and the US corporate world. They see it as an emerging economy with a potential global reach. 

 The effect of such changes on government policy is all too evident. The Vajpayee government successfully, and wisely, resisted calls for the dispatch of Indian troops to Iraq. Under Manmohan Singh, strategic ties have been given more concrete shape, a path-breaking accord signed on nuclear cooperation, and India has voted with the US on the Iran issue in the IAEA.

 The days that saw Natwar Singh?s exit from South Block also witnessed two significant events. One, the joint exercise of Indian and US air forces, and two, the lifting of the cap on H1-B visas. The constituency which presses for closer ties with the US is larger and more viable than anyone could have imagined before. 

 However, there continues to be a deep divide between the UPA government and its left partners on how it should engage with the Western powers in general and the US in particular. Also, questions remain on the implications of the nuclear agreement for India?s own nuclear programme. Similarly, the obligations of India under the strategic partnership need elaboration at a time when terrorism has resurfaced in a big way.

 The ambiguities in the Congress become clearer when it is set against the record of other parties. The Bharatiya Janata Party sees a pattern in the Congress denial and complicity in corruption. For the first time since May 2004, the BJP has an issue that could rally its dispirited and divided rank and file. 

 The CPI(M) sees the US as a major instigator of instability in the world and an aggressor. The Iran vote and the Iraq war are only indications of how the US bullies smaller countries. The left parties see a link between minority-bashing at home and closer ties with the super power.

 Where the Congress fits into all this is not always clear. After all, the Congress is not an ideologically coherent or cohesive force. It is a party whose defining feature is its pragmatism. This is why the closer engagement with the US has been furthered, not reversed by the Manmohan Singh-Sonia Gandhi regime. The fact that changes following the economic liberalization, unleashed by none other than Manmohan Singh himself, has worked the Congress?s way, has made an anti-US stance untenable. On the other hand, US attitude towards India has changed. The evidence is clear from the close attention paid to India by presidents as radically different as Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. All this made Natwar Singh?s defence sound like anachronism. India is not Venezuela, which, buffered by its oil wealth, is standing up to the US. Nor is it Cuba, which has a distinct ideological orientation and has endured years of sanctions. There is no place in the Indian polity for a Hugo Chavez or a Fidel Castro. 

 What is even more certain is that the Congress of 2005 is not the Congress of 1971. When asked whom she admired the most, Indira Gandhi often pointed to the French patriot warrior Joan of Arc. But that was at a time the Congress had in its ranks left-leaning figures like M. Kumaramangalam and the government had advisers like P.N. Haksar, not to forget D.P. Dhar or T.N. Kaul. It is difficult to identify similar figures in the Congress today. In the years out of power, the most articulate critics of American foreign policy were both products of the Nehruvian school ? one was Mani Shankar Aiyar and the other, none other than Natwar Singh himself. 

 The last may not have been heard of the Natwar Singh episode. Public life is not only about innocence or guilt, it is also about perception. The positive part is that inquiries have been set up. Only time will show if the prime minister and the government have been insulated from the damage the Volcker report?s allegations have wrought. 

 But the space within the United Progressive Alliance government for a policy that is strongly critical of the US is shrinking. The rapprochement with the US after the Pokhran explosion of May 1998 is deeper than its critics seem to realize. Unlike the last Congress government to hold office, which was under sustained pressure on human rights issues in Kashmir, this one is seen as a custodian of a growing economy whose future is bound with the US?s own. 

 It was not his views on foreign policy that spelt the end of Natwar Singh, but the mode of their articulation. Given that foreign affairs is now being handled directly by the prime minister, Manmohan Singh will have to take much of the left?s salvo on the policy front, even as he fends off the BJP?s charges of complicity in corruption. A thicker skin would be preferable under the circumstances.

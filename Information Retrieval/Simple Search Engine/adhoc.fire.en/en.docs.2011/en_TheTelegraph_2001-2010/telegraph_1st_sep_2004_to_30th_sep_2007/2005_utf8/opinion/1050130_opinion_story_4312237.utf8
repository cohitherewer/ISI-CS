 DIARY

 If you can?t beat him, make him join them. Well, one could have got the saying all wrong, but this way it best encapsulates what is about to happen to our ageing tiger, Bal Thackeray. Let?s imagine that it is their last-ditch attempt to save Indo-Pak cricket (Thackeray has threatened to sabotage the match scheduled to be played at Ahmedabad) that prompted residents of the Kalanagar colony to ask the Shiv Sena supremo to play umpire in their cricket match next week. Kalanagar is home to several top artistes and politicos, including Thackeray, and its tournament is quite prestigious. The idea could be to give the tiger a feel of a highly-charged match so that he would have second thoughts about queering the pitch for the next Indo-Pak match. There are chances that this thought never occurred to Kalanagarwallahs, but at least let?s hope that it did to some. There are always some sane members in a civil society. As for Thackeray, he is supposed to have agreed to play the role. Apart from putting him in the same league as Dickie Bird and Steve Bucknor, this could prove his love for the game, though not always its players. Provided, of course, that Thackeray can play fair for a few hours.

 What could have forced the sanyasin to withdraw from the Bihar poll campaign? Uma Bharti was the BJP?s best bet in the state; a Lodh, she would have had special appeal in a caste-ridden society and her earthy language would have paralleled Laloo?s verbal callisthenics. But just when the campaign got underway, Bharti complained of chest pain and got herself admitted to a hospital. Since then, tongues haven?t stopped wagging. For between the official announcement of her being the star campaigner and her sudden illness, there was just one surprise decision ? to enrol Pramod Mahajan to bolster the campaign. Need we say more?

 Jagdish Tytler has more responsibility. From now on, he will run a marriage-counselling bureau from his ministry. Well, sort of. Tytler has been given additional charge of handling intercontinental marriage cases. Following repeated instances of Indian girls being duped after marrying abroad, the government has ordained that such marriages can take place only after clearance by the ministry concerned. It is believed that the ministry was created at the behest of the Congress president, who is taking special interest in such cases. There is hope yet, Tytler!

 KL Saigal is dead, long live KL Saigal. The other day, India International Centre, the capital?s favourite watering hole for bureaucrats, diplomats and visiting dons, had scheduled a talk on Pakistan by visiting American scholar, Stephen Cohen. Also scheduled for the same time was a musical homage to Saigal to mark his birth centenary. Sorry, but Saigal won hands down. While a handful of scholars and retired editors heard Cohen holding forth on the mess in Pakistan in one of the small committee rooms, the auditorium was brimming with people jostling for space to hear Saigal?s melodies.

 Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore is a hero. He has been the toast of an entire nation for having brought home the single silver medal, and has been feted with the twin awards on Republic Day. But that cannot be reason enough for anyone with his surname to emblazon ?Rathore? in bold in place of the mandatory number plate at the front and back of his gleaming new car. The Punjab registration number has been relegated to a corner of the vehicle while the light shines on the magic words. One only hopes that the culprit is not our celebrity silver medallist.

 Every time the top job in the country?s internal and external agencies fall vacant, there is a mad tussle among a handful of aspirants. There are charges and counter-charges and anonymous letters and leaflets are sent to politicians and sections of the media. There was the usual flurry of activity for the head of RAW as well till the post got filled last week. The allegations, as always, referred to the misuse of funds for personal gain. This time a single-page letter accused one of the frontrunners of having bought a swanky flat with secret funds, while another was charged with having funded his daughter?s foreign education with government money. Single-page missives or not, the fact remains that unless there is a credible audit of the spendings of secret agencies, and agents, the mudslinging won?t stop. 

 Uttar Pradesh may have earned the reputation of steadily turning into an ?Oolta Pradesh?, but state employees are not giving up hope so easily. Some of the enterprising bureaucrats are seriously gunning for an image changeover. Take some of the higher-ups in the excise department. Two of them are all set to travel to Brazil to examine Rio?s liquor policy. Yes. The bureaucrats say they want to create an ?ideal climate? to see that UP continues to top the chart in liquor consumption in the country. To add more impetus to the effort, the most visible face of the Samajwadi Party, along with two of the party?s most glamourous female politicians, are supposed to visit Scotland to find out how the state can taste heady success in the days ahead. If all goes well, there will be less dependence on either feuding industrialist brothers or the Centre for development funds. UP, by the way, earns Rs 2,500 crore by way of taxes on the 5 crore litres of liquor bhaiyas consume.

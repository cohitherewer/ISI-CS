 CLASSIC BORE

 The nation should have had enough of Mr Sanjiv Bhatnagar by now. The country?s most august voice ? that of the chief justice ? has expressed annoyance with Mr Bhatnagar?s brand of insistent patriotism. He has been agitating against the inclusion of ?Sindh? in the national anthem out of a kind of territorial scruple that is silly and misplaced, to say the least. Mr Bhatnagar?s anthem-emendation drive has been going on since September last year, and he has badgered not only his countryfolk but also a number of courts, including the supreme one, with his public interest litigation appealing for the substitution of ?Sindh? with ?Kashmir?. The Supreme Court has dismissed his petition and, quite appropriately, fined him Rs 10,000 for wasting the court?s time. The judge has also admonished Mr Bhatnagar for degrading the PIL to a ?publicity interest litigation?. The national anthem ? composed in 1911, long before Partition ? is not supposed to be an open register of Indian history, recording every change in the country?s territorial constitution. The song is a finished text in itself, and the idea of updating its factual content is utterly nonsensical. The court?s anger should discourage the likes of Mr Bhatnagar ? and there are many such patriots in India, apparently with nothing better to do ? from pestering Indians and their courts in this manner.

 It is also unfortunate that such a banal matter should elicit from the country?s highest judicial body a statement about what constitutes an ?immortal classic?. Jana-Gana-Mana is a well-written and respected song, one of almost 3,000 written by Rabindranath Tagore. A classic is a classic because of its inherent literary qualities, which survive the vicissitudes of history and of taste, and not primarily because of the political aura bestowed upon it by the state. Mr Bhatnagar should not be allowed to tamper with the anthem because to do so on the grounds that he is proposing would be quite ridiculous, even if the text were not ?immortal? or ?inviolable?. To invoke these criteria might amount to substituting one kind of misplaced reverence with another. Tagore himself, whose sentiments regarding the nation was tempered with the most modern of ironies and with scepticism, would have found this vogue for exaggerated touchiness about the national flag and anthem entirely comic and not worth engaging with intellectually.

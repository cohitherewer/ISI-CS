 CHIVALRY ISN?T FOR WIVES 

 Till we meet again

 Following the Drum: The Lives of Army Wives and Daughters Past and Present By Annabel Venning, Headline, ?12.75

 Annabel Venning takes the name of her book from the memoirs of her grandmother, Beryl Walker, of the final days of British India. Awaiting evacuation in a hotel in Shimla in August 1947 along with her three children, this wife of a British soldier was unwittingly caught up in the turbulence that accompanied independence and Partition. For with her husband away, Beryl had to scour the bazaars for food for her children; even night brought no peace or rest, since her bedroom was taken over by Muslim servants sheltering from Hindu and Sikh mobs. It was a desperate situation, made all the more moving by the contrast with her upbringing in genteel England, which taught her none of the skills to deal with war situations. 

 But the paradox, as Venning discovered in the course of her researches, is that many wives of the soldiers in the British army opted to forsake the safety and relative comfort of their homes in order to accompany their husbands to war or to defend newly-acquired territories thousands of miles away. And their experiences were often far worse than anything Beryl encountered. Travelling in overcrowded and pestilential ships, marching on foot in the tropical heat or through the snow, giving birth in the midst of cannon fire, sharing the danger and privations of sieges, being widowed or losing children in a foreign land ? such was the lot of the soldier?s wife. 

 The British army did not want them. In fact, soldiers were discouraged from even marrying. ?The Service suffers bye the Multitude of Women already in the Regiment,? was what James Wolfe had to say in 1759. Chivalry was not for soldiers? wives, the two main arguments against them being that they were a drain on rations, especially in the middle of a war or a march, and that they bred decadence, indiscipline, squalor. The commanders were prepared to countenance only those women who could pull their weight, that is, ?provide, buy and dress their husbands meat...bring in fewel for fire, and wash their linen? (Sir James Turner, 1683). 

 So why were these women prepared to court danger? Venning offers two possible reasons. Love ? she quote numerous stories about wives fainting or pining away after they have been left behind. But she also hints at other more mundane reasons like a desire for adventure, the fear of not seeing their husbands for long stretches and more important, being left destitute and ending up in a poorhouse. 

 Venning?s book is an easy to read, straight narrative, meant to move readers to pity and to marvel at the courage and fortitude of the soldiers? wives. What it lacks is a critical outlook though there is much in the book that might have gained from such analysis. For example, the women body-strippers who descended on the field immediately after a battle to rob the dead and dying of their clothes and whatever they could find on them. Or figures like Christian ?Kit? Welsh, or Mother Ross as she came to be called, who left behind her three young children to join Lord Orrey?s Regiment in pursuit of her husband. For 12 years, from 1689 to 1706, she lived as a man and took part in the battles at Scellenberg and Blenheim. Her secret was finally discovered, much to her grief, in a hospital where she was taken for a battle injury. Surely, there?s more to the stories of these deviant women than the sentimentality that Venning brings to them?

 A NEW TUNE

 Morality is not a neutral value. The morals of privileged young men are far more important than the morals of poor women who make their living in dance bars. While shutting down the dance bars in Maharashtra, the deputy chief minister said that the bars were a ?corrupting influence on the youth of the state?. It might come as a surprise to the leaders in the Maharashtra government, but the flourishing business of dance bars, with 75,000 women employed as entertainers and thousands of bar staff, and the subsidiary businesses around it ? food, tailoring, beauty parlours and so on ? did not spring up in a day. The dance bar provides a huge range of livelihood opportunities in that grey area between the lawful and the almost lawless. But law is not the government?s concern, morality is. Why young men in Maharashtra should be particularly susceptible to the temptations of sexual licence is not very clear. Nor very relevant. An estimate of the average age and profession of the regular dance bar client could be quite revealing. The worry about the dance bar?s unacceptability in ?Indian culture? is part of the concern about morality. Purity by itself will not do, the young male must be pure Indian.

 The morals of the girls who are to lose their livelihoods are not the government?s headache. No one believes that the state will suddenly provide 75,000 jobs for them, especially not jobs that could give them enough to replace the ?immoral? earnings. These women, torn from a position in which dancing was their job and sex work a matter of choice, will be forced into prostitution. Nothing could be more hurtful to their dignity than the annihilation of choice, especially after they have carved out a small space of negotiation under the harshest circumstances. Yet the government speaks tenderly of the ?protection? of the women?s dignity, and revels in the role of moral saviour. Typically, a strain of feminist thinking has been used to give legitimacy to the government?s high-handed decision. According to this argument, a job that is defined by sexual exploitation ? dancing in bars is purely that ? is insulting to women?s dignity. The government claims to be ?saving? the women from such indignity; in truth, it is closing the last door to a dignified existence and pushing the women into indigence and lawlessness.

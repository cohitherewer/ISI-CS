 DIARY

 If you are on Violet and Joakim Alva Chowk, what would be the nearest landmarks? Foxed? The answer is, Gateway of India and Taj Mahal Hotel, Mumbai. Wondering who the newest couple in the pantheon is? Mr and Mrs Alva are the parents-in-law of Margaret Alva, the AICC general secretary in charge of Maharashtra. The story behind the naming goes thus: it is the Maharashtra chief minister?s truce offering to ?Kannadiga? Alva, keeping in mind the demand that the Marathi-dominated Belgaon district of Karnataka be merged with Maharashtra. Strange but true, the Congress?s arch-rival and the ruling force at the corporation, the Shiv Sena, has supported the chief minister?s move. In this rare moment of happiness all around, the only people sulking are the Marathi lobby in the Congress. Their question is simple: What is the contribution of either Margaret Alva, or her parents-in-law, all three Kannadigas, to Maharashtra? The Alva cause is not being helped at all by the news that Kannadigas are beating up Marathi-speakers in Belgaon for daring to express their desire to be part of Maharashtra.

 Even his best friend could not have predicted a smooth ride for Ghulam Nabi Azad when he took over the chief ministership of Jammu and Kashmir. But the news is that between terrorism and natural calamity, Azad had managed to find time to give the state?s bureaucracy some chin music. As many as 70 officials have been suspended already in cases of corruption. Even babus of additional and joint secretary levels are not exempt from ?raids?. The CM has fixed strict 9-to-5 working hours for the officials. On reporting late to work last week, some officials were locked up for several hours. Azad also has plans of installing surveillance equipment to keep a tab on his bureaucracy. No prizes for guessing that the babus are fuming, and trying every trick in their bag to make Azad?s life difficult. They needn?t have tried too hard. The near-collapse power system in the state has done the job for them. In a state trying to come to grips with a harsh winter and a virtually non-existent electricity set-up, Azad is up against the ire of a few more people other than the bureaucrats.

 Babus are having a tough time elsewhere too. Worried about the leakage of confidential cabinet deliberations to the media, PM Manmohan Singh took the unusual step of clamping down on the presence of bureaucrats at the weekly cabinet meetings. Instead of sitting behind their ministers, as has been the custom since the days of Nehru, they now have to wait in an adjoining room. But secretaries are not the only things missing from cabinet meetings. Gone are the Lavish five-star snacks and hot and cold beverages of the Vajpayee days. Manmohan Singh is not known to take kindly to munching between meals.

 If you thought Natwar Singh had gone underground, think again. He was spotted in Patiala recently, in the company of brother-in-law Amarinder Singh, the Punjab CM. The news of Amarinder cancelling his Delhi trip triggered off rumours about the duo chalking strategy. The bigger rumour, however, is that Natwar had shortlisted a publisher and selected an IFS officer to be his Boswell only weeks before the Volcker bomb went off. Who would have known about the next chapter then?

 Here?s something that will have a lot of people squirming with glee: All six BJP MPs caught in the money-for-questions operation are RSS pracharaks. BJP leaders are known to be quite pleased about the chance to point fingers at the holier-than-thou guardian.

 Guess who was the most ignored guest at Praveen Togadia?s daughter?s wedding? Gujarat CM Narendra Modi. Togadia?s defence was that as a sanyasi, he was not obliged to play the perfect host. But how did a sanyasi organize such a lavish feast?

 Christmas is around the corner, and among the shopping crowd in Delhi?s Khan Market, one granny and granddaughter created quite a stir last week. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra got off her car and assisted grandmother Paola Maino, walking stick and all, to sample some vegetables before shopping for some Christmas knick-knacks for young Rehan and Meira. The shopkeeper?s attempts at giving a discount were firmly thwarted.

 While his sister did her Christmas shopping, Rahul Gandhi has been busy preparing for his maiden speech in parliament. The subject has not been disclosed yet, but the tribal bill could be an educated guess, given that environmentalists like Valmik Thapar and academics from JNU are helping him with preparations. And since Janardhan Dwivedi is turning up regularly at 10 Janpath to brush up the crown prince?s Hindi, Rahul Gandhi may well be expected to make his first speech in Hindi.

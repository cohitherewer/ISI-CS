 COACH RIDE

 Nobody is playing cricket in the world of Indian cricket. By any reckoning, things are in a right royal mess. It is quite clear that the coach, Greg Chappell, and the captain, Sourav Ganguly, have fallen out completely. After what has transpired, there is no way the two of them can work together to build a united and strong team. The problem lies in the undefined position of the coach in Indian cricket. Chappell was hired by the Board of Control for Cricket in India after he made a convincing presentation to a committee that had been formed to select the coach. But he does not quite know where his powers end or begin. That he is supposed to train the players, get them into peak condition and rectify their errors so that they can perform better, is obvious. But does his job end there? Most people will answer no since it has become an established practice for the cricket coach to decide on the strategy and tactics of the team. Given the fact that Chappell is on a contract till 2007, it is also understood that he will build the team with an eye to the future. In other words, the coach has, or should have, a scheme for the present as well as for the future. Yet, such is the bizarre state of affairs in the BCCI that Chappell has no say in the selection of either the team or the captain. This gives to his position an anomaly and also puts limits on his powers of implementation. The anomaly becomes confusion when the coach and the captain fall out as Ganguly and Chappell indeed have.

 If the contents of Chappell?s email to the BCCI are anything to go by then the coach has little or no respect for Ganguly?s abilities as a cricketer and as a captain. He has described Ganguly as a shirker and as a peddler of deceit and mistrust in the team. Chappell, obviously, does not want Ganguly to be in the team either as captain or as player since he is convinced that Ganguly?s presence is detrimental to the morale and performance of the side. The point is not whether all the charges made against Ganguly by Chappell are true or not. What is critical is that this is his opinion of Ganguly and it is na?ve to expect that Chappell can work with a modicum of harmony with a player about whom he has such a poor opinion. And now that the contents of a confidential email have been leaked through an act of crass irresponsibility, it cannot be expected that Ganguly will cooperate with a coach who is hostile to him. 

 The Telegraph has always argued that in cricket, like in many other sports, the coach should be the supreme authority and the captain no more than an on-the-field figure who implements the coach?s plans. The circumstances now present an opportunity to the BCCI to affirm the authority of the coach. Will it tame the captain? It seems unlikely since the BCCI loves to divide and rule and to preserve its sway through compromise.

 REFORMER TAMED

 Most critics of Mr L.K. Advani believe that he will always be the bridesmaid and never be the bride. This assessment of him seems to have been confirmed by the mini-drama enacted by him and the Bharatiya Janata Party over his resignation and its eventual withdrawal. When Mr Advani put in his papers on Tuesday morning, he was poised to enter the history books. He had just returned from a historic visit to Pakistan where he had staked a claim to be the leading statesman of the BJP, capable of thinking beyond the bigotry of the sangh parivar. When the latter hit back, Mr Advani chose to exit as a leader who had tried to refashion his party, had failed, but had resigned with his head held high and his principles intact. The withdrawal of the resig- nation under pressure from the party conveys the impression that Mr Advani is incapable of standing up for what he believes in. That is a more polite way of saying that he does not have it in him to be a leader. But such a view of the episode is too simplistic to capture the broader significance of the whole affair.

 When Mr Advani praised Mohammad Ali Jinnah?s secularism in Pakistan, he, as a lifelong sanghi, could not have been unaware of the reactions that would emanate from Nagpur. What caught him unawares was the hostility to his statements that came from within the BJP. Some of his critics were his own handpicked men, known within the party as belonging to the Advani-lobby. This made it clear that Mr Advani, in his project to reform the BJP ? notorious for its hatred of Muslims and for its avowal of Hindutva ? had marched ahead of the party. He has been pulled back. He tried to make history, but history claimed him first. His plight is akin to what happened to Mr Jyoti Basu, the veteran leader of the Communist Par-ty of India (Marxist), in 1996. Mr Basu had then argued that the CPI(M) should support a Congress-led government at the Centre. His party shot down his arguments. But Mr Basu had initiated a process of re-thinking whose results are evident now.

 Mr Advani may have missed history?s bus just as Mr Basu had missed the chance of being the prime minister of India. But Mr Advani can draw comfort from the fact that he at least provoked a debate within the BJP. Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee, with his almost compulsive equivocation, never made debate possible. Mr Advani, on the other hand, by his dramatic statements and gestures, has forced the BJP to review its own image, to rethink its own dependence on the sangh parivar and, above all, to accept that after Mr Vajpayee and Mr Advani, it has no leaders. Mr Advani, knowingly or unknowingly, has opened up a dispute between the BJP?s past and the BJP?s future. The immediate victim appears to be Mr Advani himself. But today?s fallen hero might well be tomorrow?s unsung prophet.

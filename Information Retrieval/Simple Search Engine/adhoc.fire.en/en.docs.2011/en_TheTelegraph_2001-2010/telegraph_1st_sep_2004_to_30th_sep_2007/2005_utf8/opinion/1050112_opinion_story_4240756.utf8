 LIBRARY FIRST 

 The level of civilization a society has attained is measured by the value it puts on the pursuit of knowledge. The Confederation of Indian Industry has demonstrated that it has little or no regard for this particular pursuit. It decided to hold its Partnership Summit, 2005 in the auditorium of the National Library. The National Library is one institution which, whatever may be the abuses that have crept into it, is devoted to the cultivation of knowledge and scholarship. Its auditorium should also be used only to further the cause of learning. The purpose of the auditorium is not to house the deliberations of industrialists, however important such deliberations might be. The aims of the CII conference run counter to the purpose for which the National Library exists. The powers that run CII seem to be oblivious of the importance of the library and what it represents in the world of learning. The CII?s choice of venue for its conference reveals its attitude and its lack of respect for the National Library and the pursuit of knowledge. If the argument is that no other auditorium was available on the specified days, then the dates should have been changed and the prime minister?s visit deferred. Instead of doing that, the CII has chosen to taint the National Library by holding a conference devoted to the pursuit of Mammon.

 What is ironic and sad is that Mr Manmohan Singh, a scholar prime minister, if ever there was one, is to address the CII conclave and because of his visit the National Library will be closed to readers this morning. Mr Singh, if he is to retain his credibility as a scholar, should express in no uncertain terms his disapproval of the closure of the library and the holding of the summit in the library campus. His failure to do so will be taken, with every justification, as an endorsement of the CII?s decision and the so-called security considerations which debar readers from entering a library to read books. If there are indeed such security considerations, then care should be taken to ensure that they do not hinder the pursuit of learning. The authorities of the National Library are also complicit in the gross violation of the values that the library represents. The community of scholars is Mr Singh?s first source of belonging and identity. He should speak for the rights and dignity of that community and reprimand CII for its act of transgression.

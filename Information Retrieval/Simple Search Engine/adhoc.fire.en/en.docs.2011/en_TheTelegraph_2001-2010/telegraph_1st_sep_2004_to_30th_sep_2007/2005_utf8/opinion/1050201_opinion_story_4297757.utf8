 PAY AS YOU GO ALONG 

The recently presented white paper on VAT seems to clear 

all doubts regarding the subject, writes S. Venkitaramanan 

 Open and shut case 

If I recollect correctly, sales tax was first introduced 

in India at the state level by C. Rajagopalachari during his tenure as premier 

of Madras in the Thirties. Simple in concept and easy to levy, sales tax became 

the bulwark of state finances. Traders learnt to comply with it, in spite of continuing 

tales of harassment. 

Tax reformers have been quick to find fault with this 

workhorse of Indian public finance. Primarily, their attack was based on the contention 

that it led to ?cascading?. A trader who pays sales tax on his purchases pays 

tax not only on the added value, but also on the value inclusive of tax already 

paid on inputs. This leads to what critics call cascading ? tax on tax. With a 

view to avoid this, value-added tax was devised ? which would set off the taxes 

already paid on inputs against taxes payable. VAT was thus seen as more efficient 

? since it taxed only the value added in a transaction. This meant that a tax 

assessee could claim refund of tax equal to whatever tax he had paid on his inputs. 

This enabled the effective tax rate to be lower.

The government of India had endorsed this idea in 

the last decade. The empowered committee of state finance ministers under its 

convener, Asim Dasgupta, the finance minister of West Bengal, has finally worked 

out a consensus on the structure of VAT, which comes into force on April 1, 2005. 

P. Chidambaram unveiled a white paper on the subject, together with Dasgupta, 

recently. Only one state is yet to agree, but it too may be brought around soon. 

As Chidambaram pointed out, this is one of the most radical changes in our financial 

system since independence.

One of the fears about VAT relates to the collection 

of refunds on the basis of certificates of tax paid. The history of the working 

of VAT elsewhere shows that evasion on the basis of fabricated certificates of 

tax paid is common. Even in respect of Modvat ? a limited introduction of VAT 

in excise duties in the Eighties ? the comptroller and auditor general had highlighted 

the massive loss of revenues. A cottage industry developed in many parts of India 

to produce fictitious documents of tax paid, which would be used to claim Modvat 

refunds. The key to the success of the new VAT lies in overcoming this flaw. 

The white paper lays stress on computerizing all records 

to prevent such abuse. Tax refunds will be checked against computerized records, 

which are less prone to abuse than paper documents. But this would involve familiarizing 

traders and the new tax administration with the nitty-gritty of computerization. 

Our software technicians and tax administrators should live up to the challenge. 

However, there is need to train and interact closely with trade and industry, 

which must understand the broad implications of computerization. This is a difficult 

task, in view of the large numbers of traders, small industries and others involved.

The proposals in the white paper involve a sea-change 

in the country?s sales-tax administration. Above all, the accumulated stock of 

legal pronouncements by various tribunals and courts relating to sales tax will 

have to be reinterpreted in the light of the new VAT legislation, unless the latter 

takes it into account. Hopefully, the VAT legislation will be simple and not a 

breeding ground for litigation. These problems can be sorted out by establishing 

special tribunals. 

The white paper discloses that one of the benefits 

of tax reforms will be the phasing out of Central sales tax. CST has been a part 

of our fiscal landscape for the last five decades or so. Abandoning CST will involve 

losing nearly Rs 15,000 crore in revenues ? a big loss for the states. 

The white paper also visualizes the elimination of 

additional excise duty on textiles, sugar and tobacco, which will be spread out 

over a year or two. Additional excise duty on these commodities was a brilliant 

idea, which enabled taxes on these commodities to be collected at the manufacturers? 

end, instead of harassment by sales-tax collectors on traders of these commodities. 

Hopefully, VAT will not throw away the advantage conferred by additional excise 

duty. The same caution is in order regarding CST. Higher rates of VAT should not 

replace the concessional 4 per cent rate of CST. This would be contrary to the 

pulls of economic integration and an Indian common market.

The white paper does not directly address the issue 

of service tax, which should be brought into the state tax net according to the 

recommendations of the Kelkar task force. Ideally, service tax too should be within 

the scope of state VAT. But the Centre seems to be still not clear about what 

steps to take to move this forward. Equally uncertain is whether to cover customs 

duties within the scope of an integrated VAT.

The white paper covers the question of compensation 

to be given to states for the losses in revenue suffered by them as a result of 

VAT. Logically VAT, being a more transparent and efficient system, should not 

lead to a loss of revenue. But the white paper recognizes the transitional problems. 

How the losses will be determined is not spelt out. But a finance commission-type 

of body would be best equipped to determine the amounts of compensation to be 

given to states.

VAT 2005 is a revolution that was waiting to happen, 

given the consensus between economists, the Centre and states. Whether we can 

make a success of this experiment depends on continuing with the spirit of understanding 

that was in evidence during the workings of the empowered committee. 

A note of caution for enthusiasts in the direct tax 

administration who hope to pounce on the data revealed by VAT to catch income-tax 

evaders. True, the VAT documents are a mine of information about the undisclosed 

earnings of traders and small industrialists. This is because in order to claim 

VAT refunds, they must disclose details of their inputs and outputs. But the undue 

enthusiasm of the direct tax collectors may be a disincentive to full compliance 

under VAT. The trade-off between the gains under VAT and ?losses? under direct 

taxes may guide tax-payers? behaviour. Some initial forbearance on the part of 

the hawks till VAT settles in is advisable.

May VAT 2005 signal a new era of cooperation between 

the tax-payer and administrator, leading to the greater good of the national economy 

and the consumer ? that is, may it add value to all sections of the society.

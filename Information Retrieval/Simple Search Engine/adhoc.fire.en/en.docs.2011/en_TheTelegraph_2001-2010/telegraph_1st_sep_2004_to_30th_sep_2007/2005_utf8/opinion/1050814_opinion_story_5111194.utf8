 DIARY

 Should someone else in the cabinet have followed Jagdish Tytler? Perhaps. We?ll explain. When the ground stopped shaking (with protests this time) following the ATR?s guest appearance in parliament, Manmohan Singh tried to figure out why he had so much egg on his face. He discovered that the cause lay closer ?home? than he had expected. His home minister, Shivraj Patil, had done nothing about the report for the past six months after the Nanavati commission findings had been presented to him, nor briefed him about its potentially explosive contents. However, to be fair to Patil, he did place the ATR at a cabinet meeting, but the matter was put last on the agenda, and given that an inviting dinner had been awaiting the ministers, the ATR was brushed aside. There was another reason for the haste with which the ATR was forgotten. Tytler himself had been present at the meeting, and most of his colleagues had thought it unbecoming of them to remind others of a completely forgettable past. Now, despite the rather embarrassing reminder, Patil will get away, if only by a hair?s breadth, and if only because he thinks he has somebody?s ear more important than the PM?s. 

 Who will have the lady? The tussle between the BJP and the Congress to woo Mamata Banerjee seems to be on in full swing, and yes, despite the show in parliament. That the tamasha has done nothing to reduce Mamata?s appeal is evident from the way the two parties went about things soon after. While the left bayed for her blood, the BJP came out in her defence and the Congress refused to take any stand against her, although not in so many words. The parliamentary affairs minister, Ghulam Nabi Azad, is supposed to have told the speaker, ?She is like this only.? It was only after much insistence from other allies that Azad agreed to condemn the act, but without naming her. Will she be back with the Congress then? That perhaps only Pranabda can tell!

 The minister for tourism, Renuka Chowdhury, looks all set to hit the headlines again. Last time it was the controversy surrounding the apparently arbitrary ban on a certain brand of scotch whisky from ITDC-run duty-free shops that took her to the front pages. This time, the long-term lease of a restaurant-cum-discotheque in one of ITDC?s most prestigious properties in New Delhi assures her spotlight again. Showtime again, Renukaji!

 The Chhattisgarh CM, Raman Singh, is following in the footsteps of his predecessor, and without too many qualms. Singh will soon invite LK Advani to lay the foundation stone of his new capital. Incidentally, the site is barely five kilometres away from the village Pausa, which Ajit Jogi had earmarked as his new capital. When Singh was asked about his uninspired choice, he is supposed to have laid the blame on a stone ? the foundation stone. One had already been lain by Sonia Gandhi at the prompting of Jogi in March 2003. Chhattisgarh may soon be tripping over a slew of foundation stones, laid five kilometres apart.

 There is full-scale war between two of Congress?s spokespersons ? Anand Sharma and Abhishek Manu Singhvi ? so much so that one blacklists whichever TV channel approaches the other. The two-day-each norm for party briefings has allowed Sharma and Singhvi to have two days each, but has left only one day for Jayanthi Natarajan and nothing for Rajiv Shukla. All the better for scribes. Shukla is proving to be a veritable goldmine of stories.

 Sometimes, the BJP does not even need a reason to smirk at madam. The other day, Samata Party MP, Prabhunath Singh, hauled up the Bihar government for the unsavoury references made to legendary hero, Prithviraj Chauhan, in history books in the state. Sonia, who was attentively listening, turned around to locate a minister of state in the PMO who shared the hero?s name. Outside, BJP MPs were soon laughing over how Sonia, who they presumed to be blissfully unaware of the legend, had started looking for present-day Prithviraj. Wrong again?

 Rajiv Gandhi once bragged that 

 to all its opponents, the Congress ?naani yaad dilati 

 hai.? Last week, it was the BJP reminding the party 

 of Nana (Nanavati).

 BJP?s vice-president, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, has a problem. Each time he throws a party, he?s in a spot, for some reason or the other. A few weeks ago, when he threw a birthday bash, the RSS old-guard Dattopant Thengadi passed away. Naqvi went ahead with the party, which scandalized Jhandewalan. This week, Naqvi decided to celebrate the festival of Teej. But barely hours after the invitations were sent out, an RSS patron died. Naqvi deferred the celebrations by a day, but even that didn?t stop wagging tongues in Jhandewalan. His guest list consisted of the leading lights of opponent parties and less of his own partymen. There was chum Amar Singh, who arrived with Jaya Prada. There was Anand Sharma, who had absented himself from his own fraternity?s mango party, and several other people who turned heads. There were also the Nehru-Gandhis in that list, but they didn?t turn up. Thank god for small mercies, Naqvi!

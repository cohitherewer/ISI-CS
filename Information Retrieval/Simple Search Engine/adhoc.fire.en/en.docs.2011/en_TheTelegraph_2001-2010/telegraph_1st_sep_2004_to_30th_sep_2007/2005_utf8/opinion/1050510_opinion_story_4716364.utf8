 PREY ON THE CRISIS

 The new task force on tiger conservation has to rework the agenda and enlarge the social base of the project, writes Mahesh Rangarajan

 The politics of the tiger does make headlines. But rarely does it get as serious as it has over the last fortnight. The prime minister, Manmohan Singh, underlined the enormity of the issue last month when he announced the formation of a task force of five experts to examine the larger issues that afflict not only the conservation of the national animal in its habitat, but also the gamut of issues, institutional and human, that affect it.

 The tiger?s struggle to retain its stripes in a fast-changing world has never stopped those who defend it from disagreeing over how best to act in its favour. The new chapter of the war over the tiger has one well-known and publicized dimension, namely the bid to prevent poaching from depleting numbers, especially in smaller reserves in north-west and central India.

 But the issues were never bound to be as simple as that. A newly formed forum of members of parliament for the tiger and the wilderness has tried to drum up concern. It includes, most notably, the young MP for Amethi, Rahul Gandhi, and Guna?s second generation Congressman, Jyotiraditya Scindia. Others, for the group cuts across party lines, include Manvendra Singh of the Bharatiya Janata Party and Jai Panda of the Biju Janata Dal of Orissa.

 The concerns are critical but the solution proposed is bound to create disquiet. Local people rarely welcome the deployment of paramilitary forces in this country. Though necessary in conditions of law and order problems and riot, such deployment has all too often been followed by serious denial of human dignity and rights. Many forest areas, and more so those that harbour tigers and other mega fauna this country is famed for, are home, resource catchment and livelihood source for people whose poverty is matched by their low rank in terms of power and status.

 In fact, as Amitav Ghosh brought out so movingly in his recent novel on the Sunderbans, The Hungry Tide, what is remarkable is the level and degree of respect and tolerance that many such peoples display for large animals that live in and around the area. Many of those who have worked on the issue of the tiger, including a member of the task force ? Valmik Thapar in his fine work The Cult of the Tiger ? have acknowledged and celebrated such traditions.

 No doubt there are real and even fissile conflict situations, and these often work to the detriment of both the larger ecology and landscape and the poor local people. But surely one of the major flaws of the entire tiger conservation effort over the last three decades since the launch of Project Tiger in 1973 has been the unwillingness to engage with locally-rooted losers.

 Such conflicts are not unique or specific to India. What is notable is the lack of attempts to address them in an innovative manner or to go beyond mere better policing and detection. These techniques are not dispensable and perhaps never will be. But they cannot be the lynchpin of action without any commensurate effort to cultivate and nurture a larger constituency.

 A few instances where other kinds of efforts have been made may be a beacon of hope for the tiger task force. In Karnataka?s Kudremukh National Park, opposition to mining by a public sector unit found wildlife enthusiasts, biologists and other scientists reach out to a much larger constituency. The powerful agrarian communities that live downstream joined the protests against mining not out of love for the tiger but because the slurry makes the water unusable for the fields. A distinguished hydrologist made a presentation before the then chief minister, S.M. Krishna, who admitted his own ignorance on the issue. Krishna, as a former industry minister, had been among those who had cleared the project.

 This effort by the group,Wildlife First, which takes a more conventional preservation-oriented view of conservation issues is still significant. For one, and this should be obvious, in a federal polity, the 28 tiger reserves are scattered across ten states. It is these states and not the Centre that staffs, administers and controls the reserves. Unlike in the Seventies and the Eighties, when one party ruled much of India, a variety of political formations now govern various states. Engagement at the state level is as much a must as that at the local level.

 There is a further dimension. Many of those who live in and near tiger reserves and practise dry land agriculture, wage labour, herding and gathering have gained little either from development or from conservation. Chronic under-employment and lack of access to even the basic amenities are a typical feature. To this has been added the perception that the reserves are a no-go zone from which they derive little advantage.

 In the Nineties, the problem was sought to be addressed through a huge multi-million dollar eco-development scheme. Unfortunately, this did little to improve protection or provide sufficient local benefit. Fortunately, the wider environmental movement has thrown up a penumbra of alternative ways of harnessing nature?s wealth in a more sustained and equitable manner. These techniques and practices, given sufficient help, can help in the rim of the reserves and even in the buffer zones.

 In the early Seventies, the crisis in tiger survival due to sport hunting, poaching and the absence of refugia led to significant initiatives centered around protecting it with its prey and providing intact habitats. That core mission does need renewal. But in order to move ahead, it also needs serious rethinking of how to accomplish its mission. 

 The chairperson of the force, Sunita Narain, in an article written some weeks ago, had argued that the tiger was the victim of an intellectual crisis. In order to survive, it needed fresh ideas. In her first press conference, she went further, arguing there was an institutional breakdown that required redress.

 She has hit the nail on the head. In order to survive, the tiger needs a larger constituency. Innovative ways to win friends can only come about if larger concerns are taken into consideration. The issue of its habitat, for instance, cannot be delinked from the fate of those who live in it.

 The reworking of a conservation agenda that addresses both ecological and livelihood issues has never been an easy task in a country like India. But the larger crisis is also a moment of opportunity. It is not only the task force that faces a challenge. It has to expand the social base for conservation without diluting the existing achievements in protection. Yet the moment could be a promising one if the crisis is treated as an opportunity to rethink ideas and strategies. It is not as easy as deploying more forces but it may lead to a more lasting legacy.

 Letters to Editor

 King of jokes

 Sir ? Michael Jackson may not be the great entertainer that he was but he continues to amuse all the same (?Jacko?s no Jesus, but not far from Gandhi?, May 14). Sample this. Cancer-stricken children, says Jackson, can beat the disease with ?love and caring?. Possible, but surely not the kind of love he showered on his 13-year-old victim. And the very idea of Jackson being in the same league as Mother Teresa in charity is revolting. Somebody needs to tell the superstar to shut his trap, lest his remarks queer the pitch further.

 Yours faithfully,

 Neil Sengupta, Calcutta

 Trespassers beware

 Sir ? Tarun Gogoi?s attempts to define ?Assamese?, and decide who are the indigenous people of the state, are quite pointless (?By definition?, May 11). If language is the key, then all the non-Assamese speaking people ? Nepalese, Biharis, Manipuris, Bengalis, Bodo, Hmar, Dimasas ? who have been living in this region for decades would be disqualified. Again, if all who have lived in the region from before 1971 qualify, then would the Nepalese, Biharis, Manipuris, Bengalis, Bodo, Hmar, Dimasas like to be called Assamese?

 Instead of wasting time, the government should take measures to check illegal migrants and implement them strictly. Every year, hundreds of migrants from Bangladesh come to Assam, especially Silchar, Karimganj, Hailakandi. They also manage to bring out ration cards and permanent residence certificates from right under the nose of the officials. If the people know all about it, then it is most unlikely that the authorities are in the dark.

 Yours faithfully,

Soma Chakraborty, Silchar

 Sir ? The people of Assam are a medley of numerous tribes, most of whose members prefer to be known by the name of their tribe than as ?Assamese?. There is nothing wrong in this. Sadly, political parties have started exploiting this phenomenon for their own ends, by asking for more autonomy or rights for a particular group. The illegal migrants coming from Bangladesh have benefited from this. The Congress governments at the state and the Centre do not want to repeal the Illegal Migrants (Detection by Tribunals) Act, because the migrants are a captive vote bank. But the intruders are a threat not just to Assam but to the whole nation. The prime minister has talked about fencing and other measures along the border, but what about the millions who have already come in?

 Yours faithfully,

Ranjan K. Baruah, Guwahati

 Special case

 Sir ? I fully agree with Iti Misra?s letter, ?What a debut!? (May 6). But in the instance mentioned by her, I must attempt to defend the writer of ?Tintin on stage, mischief backstage?. The ?veteran duo?, she refers to, Abu Jani and Sandeep Khosla, are well known in the fashion fraternity. But they had never showed at the India Fashion Week and this year marked their debut at the event. Of course, ?debut? and ?veteran? are a contradiction in terms and should never be used together. 

 Yours faithfully,

Ratna Chakrabarti, Calcutta

 Letters to Editor

 Not a great way to fly

 Sir ? Indian Airlines has been renamed Indian with the same brashness that the Maharaja was once banished from Air India. But one wishes the authorities had invited public participation in the process through some competition. IA would have then found something which was simple and yet meaningful. We have had Doordarshan and Akashvani, beautiful names for the national media. If the civil aviation ministry really intended to go ?Indian?, wouldn?t ?Bharat? have served its purpose better?

 Yours faithfully,

 Subhash C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Choice matters

 Sir ? The surveys referred to in Bishakha De Sarkar?s ?Who?s a virgin these days?? (Dec 4) were conducted among students of St Stephen?s College, software engineers and workers in call centres. Of the interviewees, only one out of four found sex before marriage acceptable. The majority preferred sex after marriage. 

 There is nothing wrong about youths seeking advice on sex but it is horrifying to note that unmarried mothers want to hand their children over to the Karnataka state council of child welfare. We should also realize that television serials are no representation of social realities. As for Kushboo?s comment about premarital sex, her statement was her personal opinion and should not be interpreted as a reflection of the society she is a part of. There are innumerable youths in our country who opt to remain virgin till they marry, and Kushboo cannot disrespect their sentiments. Like Kushboo, they are entitled to their personal views. 

 A marriage rests on mutual trust and partners should have the right to know whether any one of the two has had a sexual experience before marriage. But most important, unmarried mothers should be discouraged from abandoning their babies.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? It is unfortunate that in a country like India, where there are more pressing problems like that of poverty, one should debate over whether premarital sex is a taboo or not. As India has one of the largest number of HIV-infected people, more emphasis needs to be put on safe sex rather than on premarital or extra-marital sex. Further, those in favour of pre-marital sex should know that in most cases, it is the woman who pays for any mishap.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Sex, quite obviously, is no longer considered to be an expression of love. It has become synonymous with lust. Premarital and extra-marital sex are being valourized as being empowering. As a result, the problems of adolescent sex, increasing prostitution among educated, well-off women, breakdown of marriages are becoming more persistent by the day. Another troubling question is whether this concept of ?sexual liberation? applies to men as well. Can free indulgence in sex by married and unmarried men be considered to empower them?

 Yours faithfully,

 Parting shot

 Sir ? ?Is it a cat, a fox or a new carnivore?(Dec 7), reminds one of man?s eternally inquisitive nature which eggs him on to explore the unknown. More than 350 new species are said to have been discovered in Borneo in the last ten years. It is a matter of serious concern that deforestation the world over is destroying the natural habitat of animals. As human greed has already resulted in the extinction of many species, this newly-discovered species needs to be protected. Wildlife experts need to take up conservation on a war footing.

 Yours faithfully

 Tuli Das, Calcutta

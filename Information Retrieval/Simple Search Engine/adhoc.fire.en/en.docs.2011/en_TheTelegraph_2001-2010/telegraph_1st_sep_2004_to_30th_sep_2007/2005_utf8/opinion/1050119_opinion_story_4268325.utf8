 IN THE PIPELINE

 It is always a matter of time before economic logic triumphs over political or nationalist rhetoric. So the pipeline that can now be laid to carry natural gas from Myanmar to India through Bangladesh is actually a victory for the economic argument. This is the first time that Bangladesh has agreed to let its territory be used for the transportation of any commodity. The agreement that the three countries signed in Yangon last week assures Dhaka of $125 million annually in transit fee from the gas pipeline as well as other benefits. Not that the economic benefits from such a project were unknown to Bangladesh. But compulsions of domestic politics prevented successive regimes in Dhaka from taking the rational step. Allowing any transit facility to India was usually projected as a sell-out to the latter and a possible threat to Bangladesh?s security. The agreement in Yangon could thus augur a great leap forward in bilateral and regional cooperation. The fact that Pakistan too has now accepted a similar proposal to let its land be used for the transport of gas from Iran to India strengthens this new hope. It is significant that the new initiative has begun with natural gas. This could lead to a reality check on the contentious issue of the export of Bangladesh?s gas to India. 

 Ultimately, though, both New Delhi and Dhaka have to agree on a free flow of all goods across their borders. Dhaka has complaints about India not doing enough to allow it the right of passage to other neighbours in the region. It is thus understandable why it wanted to extract certain concessions from New Delhi in return for agreeing to the gas pipeline project. There is no reason why India should not allow its territory to be used for the transmission of hydroelectricity from Bhutan and Nepal to Bangladesh. Similarly, there is enough merit in Dhaka?s demand for more tariff concessions on the export of Bangladeshi goods to India. It would be wrong, however, to hold the gas project hostage to Dhaka?s proposal on power from the two Himalayan nations. Relations between New Delhi and Dhaka have been strained for some time, particularly over the issue of the alleged use of Bangladeshi territory by militants from India?s North-east. While it brings economic benefits to both neighbours, the Yangon initiative could also help restore the lost trust.

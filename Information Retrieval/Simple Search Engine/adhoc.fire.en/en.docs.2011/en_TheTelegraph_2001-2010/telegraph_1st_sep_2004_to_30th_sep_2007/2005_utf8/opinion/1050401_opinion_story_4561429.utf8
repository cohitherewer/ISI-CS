 Paperback Pickings

 Stunt queen or feminist icon?

Fearless Nadia (Penguin, Rs 295) by 

Dorothee Wenner is subtitled ?The true story of Bollywood?s original stunt 

queen?. It is the story of how an Australian blonde with European features, Mary 

Evans, become a celebrated stunt queen in popular Indian cinema and a feminist 

icon in the West at the turn of the millennium. From shop assistant to secretary, 

chorus girl, circus performer and then stardom, the Hunterwali was a swashbuckling 

mixture of action, eroticism and progressive ideas, wielding revolvers to the 

accompaniment of rousing music, racing along the top of rushing trains, beating 

up men and playing with lions.

Three dog night (Penguin, Rs 350) by 

Peter Goldsworthy is a novel about loving too much by one of Australia?s eminent 

writers. After ten years in London, Martin Blackman returns to Adelaide with his 

wife and fellow psychiatrist Lucy, blissfully happy. But then he introduces her 

to his old friend Felix, once a brilliant surgeon, now barred from practising 

and changed beyond recognition. In the complicated triangle that develops, Martin 

must decide just how far he is prepared to go for Felix. The opening lines: ?If 

love is an obsessive-compulsive disorder ? same driven behaviour, same altered 

brain state, same chemistry ? then I have been ill for years. But never as sick 

with bliss, as diseased, as now.? 

A shift in the wind (HarperCollins, Rs 295) 

by Aminuddin Khan is a richly evocative novel about the lives and loves 

of the Hyderabadi aristocracy in the Fifties and Sixties. Zafar, a goodlooking 

young nobleman, has an affair with a married woman who declines to leave her aging 

husband for him, and so, respecting her decision, he marries and falls in love 

with the beautiful Zeba. But his passage to fulfilment is crossed with trials 

of love and death, kinship and social change.

The collector?s wife (Zubaan/Penguin, Rs 

295) by Mitra Phukan is about Rukmini?s life in small-town Assam, married 

to the district collector and teaching English literature. There is the big, beautiful 

bungalow and endless dull parties, and occasional ?incidents? in the districts, 

casting the shadow of insurgency, leading up to a terrible d?noument. Very unremarkable.

 Frank simoes? Goa (Roli, Rs 295) tells 

the story of Simoes finding his perfect acre by the sea in Goa, where he began 

to build his dream house, Rockheart. It eventually becomes one Goan?s 

discovery of his idyllic native land. It is peopled by a colourful cast of characters, 

from Felix Xavier Fernando, the confidant of cobras, to Barty and Bostao, who 

must be the world?s only feni-fuelled carwashing experts.

Aditi and the marine sage (Tulika, Rs 80) 

by Suniti Namjoshi brings back, for its young readers, Aditi and her friends, 

this time on a mission for the Island Sage ? they must contact her sister who 

lives in the depths of the sea off Australia, on the Great Barrier Reef. From 

flights on dragonback over blue-green oceans to trips underwater in a Thought 

Submarine, there is much excitement in store. This is a contemporary fairytale 

adventure, with hi-tech gadgetry and laser-spewing dragons. But it is as sensitive 

to human feelings as it is receptive to technology, fusing them in unexpected 

ways. There are excellent illustrations by Shefalee Jain.

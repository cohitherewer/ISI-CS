 BORDER LINE

 Territorial bargains can draw on history, but only the politics of the day can settle them. Mr Subash Ghisingh can go back in history in order to stake his claims on new areas for the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council. Places like the Dooars or the foothills of Darjeeling may have belonged to the old kingdoms of Bhutan, Nepal or the present-day Sikkim before their boundaries were re-drawn by the British. Darjeeling itself belonged to Sikkim until 1835, when the hill town was ceded to the British. But is it realistic for Mr Ghisingh ? or for anyone else, for that matter ? to cite history and seek to include Siliguri or the Dooars in the DGHC?s territorial jurisdiction? To do so would amount to completely ignoring the demographic and other changes that have taken place in the areas in more recent times. Mr Ghisingh has been too wily a politician not to know this. That raises questions about the real motives behind his claims on these additional areas for the DGHC. True, he had raised some questions about the council?s area at the time of the Darjeeling accord in 1986. But those related to some Nepali-majority villages adjoining the council?s territory. What he is asking for now is an entirely different matter; it has the potential for political and ethnic destabilization in a sensitive border area. 

 Both New Delhi and Calcutta have to be extremely cautious in dealing with Mr Ghisingh?s latest demands. The Union and the state governments have already conceded his major demand by agreeing to include the DGHC under the sixth schedule of the Constitution. This new status will give the council far more powers and a greater degree of autonomy than it had enjoyed so far. This despite the fact that Darjeeling does not have a tribal-majority population. So far, the autonomous councils under the sixth schedule were meant only for such people. Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee agreed to postpone the council elections twice, primarily to placate the Gorkha leader. In negotiating on the issues, the chief minister has rightly put Darjeeling?s peace ahead of politics. This makes eminent political sense if one recalls the violent agitation for a separate state that Mr Ghisingh led in the Eighties. A democratic state cannot close the doors of dialogue on even the most intractable of dissenters. But only a weak state would submit to threats of violence and political blackmail.

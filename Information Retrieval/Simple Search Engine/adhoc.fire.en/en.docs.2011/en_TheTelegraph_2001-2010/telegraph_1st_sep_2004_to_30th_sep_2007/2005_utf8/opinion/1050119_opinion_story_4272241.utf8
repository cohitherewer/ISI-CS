 Letters to Editor

 The fine art of getting away

 Sir ? How is it that the law rarely 

 manages to catch up with high-profile individuals? Sometime 

 back, a policeman in the convoy of the CPI(M) leader, Biman 

 Bose, beat up the driver of a car which had dared to come 

 too close to Bose?s car in trying to squeeze through a half-opened 

 level crossing along with the convoy. Of course, Bose emerged 

 untainted, as if unaware of what his attendant policeman 

 was doing in front of him. More recently, a top cop, Shyamal 

 Dutta, was in a similar situation. But when the gateman 

 refused to oblige by opening the gate, policemen in Dutta?s 

 entourage had to beat him up too. One of the policemen has 

 been suspended, but not a word about the role of their superior. 

 True, neither Bose nor Dutta stepped out of their air-conditioned 

 vehicles and took part in the fun and games, but then, neither 

 did Narendra Modi kill a Muslim during the pogrom in Gujarat. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sreya Sarkar, Calcutta 

Green no more

 Sir ? The grounds of the Victoria Memorial have vanished from public domain after the introduction of an entry fee. A large part of the Maidan is again on the verge of becoming out of bounds because a media house has hatched a scheme to create gardens, sculptures and amphitheatres there. The entry to Eden Gardens is going to be restricted by slapping an entry fee soon. A major part of the strand by the Hooghly also attracts a fee. In other words, all these places, which were truly public till recently, are now going to be utilized by certain agencies to earn money. Where do the people go? I do not mean the affluent ones who do not mind spending money even on an evening stroll. I mean those who are unemployed, or do not have enough disposable incomes to pay entry fees, or those who feel that creating gardens and amphitheatres in the Maidan is just a clever way to encroach upon public property. The message that this conveys is that from now, places like the Maidan and the Victoria Memorial will be accessible to affluent Calcuttans; it does not matter if the rest, though much larger in number, suffocate for want of breathing space. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sanjoy Ghose, Calcutta

 Sir ? The report, ?Directory to save heritage? (Jan 9), is timely. I am visiting Calcutta after a long absence. It is heartbreaking to see the systematic destruction of our heritage for which I hold responsible politicians who held office since 1959, when I left Calcutta. Recently, I went to see the houses of three Bengali poets, Rangalal Bandopadhyay, Michael Madhusudan Dutt and Hemchandra Bandopadhyay. The way we have treated their memory is unpardonable. Rangalal?s fine house is replaced by a hideous construction. Madhusudan?s elegant house is in a sorry state, though still inhabited. Hemchandra?s house, an imposing construction, now stands derelict at the corner of Paddmapukur Square. I think heritage preservation should be taken away from the public works department and entrusted with a body of educated and caring people. They must also be given the necessary powers and funds to preserve our heritage. 

 In the West, such bodies do a splendid job. Thanks to them, the memories of even some long-forgotten individuals are being preserved. The houses of these three poets being quite close to one another, a heritage trail of some sort could be created. We still have the opportunity to preserve at least two of the buildings.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? It is over a year since I read that our city would be blessed with 100 new public parks in the course of the next few months. I do not know of any new park that has come up during the last twelve months, leave alone 100. What I have noticed instead, and with great sorrow, is that we have gone about destroying most of the public parks in and around the city.

 We can start from the best of them all, the Victoria Memorial park, and go on to the Eden Gardens, College Square, Azad Hind Bagh (Hedua), Dhakuria lakes, Deshapriya Park, Deshbandhu Park, Hrishikesh Park, Shradhananda Park, and so on. In the Victoria Memorial grounds the ?light and sound? show was added, with all its concrete props. At the Eden Gardens, first the gates on the west and east were shut down, then the boundary railing on the west was removed, the space right outside taken over by private bus-stand kiosks, eateries, public toilets, telephone booths and so on. A large part of the original ground was earlier turned into a nursery, inaccessible to the public. The boating pool here is in a pathetic, stinking state. 

 The less said about the other parks, the better. The iron railings are long gone, so the boundaries are now marked by all forms of shops. Inside, cultural, swimming, athletics, laughing clubs have come up, or booths vending milk and fishery products ? even public conveniences, water pumping substations, corporation offices, and storage godowns or garbage dumps. Whatever little is left after carving out such ?utilities? is used as playground by local boys. Is there a single park where one can go and relax, without the fear of being hit by a ball? Could the authorities do something about restoring the existing parks before thinking about creating new ones?

 Yours faithfully,

Prem Chand Mohta, Calcutta

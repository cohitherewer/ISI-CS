 BLAST FROM THE PAST

 Union minister Jagdish Tytler may have resigned, but it is too early to write him off. After all, this staunch Congress party hand is known to be a survivor 

 TYTLER TRIVIA

 Pays obeisance to: Congress president Sonia Gandhi

 Close to: Sonia Gandhi confidant Ahmed Patel 

 Can rsquo;t stand: Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit 

 Vibes with: Delhi 

 Congresswoman Kiran Choudhury 

 Proud of: Fashion designer son Siddharth.

 Jagdish Tytler is an honourable man. When he resigned earlier this week from the Union council of ministers, he showed the world at large ? and Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit in particular ? that he was a man of integrity. So he took a while to decide that he wanted to clear his name for an act committed ? or not committed ? 21 years ago. Whats a score-and-one year in a politicians life, after all? 

 Tytler doesnt like it one bit, but there are some unkind people who have been linking him with the Sikh massacre of 1984 ? when wild mobs, some allegedly led by local Congressmen, went on a rampage on the streets of Delhi. The G.T. Nanavati commission probing the killings ? whose report was placed in Parliament on Tuesday ? pointed a finger at Tytler. For one full day, even as parliamentarians erupted all around him, Tytler bravely held on to his chair. By Wednesday evening, as the outcry reached its crescendo, he had resigned. 

 I want to clear my name, he said, though it wasnt immediately clear how and when he was going to do that. The honourable member of Parliament from Sadar in Delhi sought to stress that he was innocent. He was out of town the day Indira Gandhi was assassinated ? the action that acted as a trigger for the widespread violence that followed. And on November 1, 1984, when Delhi was burning, he was at Teen Murti Memorial, sitting by the slain Prime Ministers body, Tytler insisted. 

 When pesky reporters asked him why he had to resign when his conscience was clean, Tytler replied modestly that it was all for the party. He had been in the Congress for 30 long years, he said, and didnt want the party to suffer. 

 The grey areas of truth and falsehood are still being sifted, but its a fact that the 61-year-old Congressman is a staunch party hand. Often perceived as a Sanjay Gandhi acolyte, it was actually Rajiv Gandhi who brought him into politics. Tytler met Indiras elder son, then a pilot, in a flying club. Subsequently, Rajiv ? who had then nothing to do with politics ? urged his mother to bring Tytler into the party, says a former aide of Rajiv Gandhi. 

 For Tytler, that marked a turn that he would possibly never have thought of. Born in Gujranwala ? now in Pakistan ? in a Kapoor family, he was adopted by Delhi educationist, J.D. Tytler, who ran an eponymous school in Delhi. Old students of the J.D. Tytler School remember the young Tytler as a dapper, ladies man. He looked like a Hindi film hero ? he wore black pants with a white shirt, or a black shirt with white pants ? and we found him very handsome, says an alumnus. 

 He may have been honourable then as well, but old friends solely remember him as someone fond of the good things of life. When radios were a luxury, young Jagdish carried a transistor. When cycles were the norm, he rode a Vespa scooter. When girls were the subject of dreams, he had a series of girlfriends, one of whom ? a young lady called Jennifer Brown ? he later married. 

 Till the early Seventies, Tytler was your ordinary man about town, running his fathers school. Life changed drastically once Rajiv had nudged him into politics. Tytler soon found a mentor in Sanjay Gandhi. During the Emergency, he was known as one of Sanjays boys; a couple of years later ? after Sanjay died in a plane crash in 1982 ? he was a leading member of Rajivs infamous shouting brigade. 

 And that was curious, for Tytler is largely perceived as a soft-spoken man. I find him a decent man, very easy to interact with, says D.P. Tripathi, general secretary of the Nationalist Congress Party, a constituent of the United Progressive Alliance government. He is decent in his speech and conducts himself well. 

 Not everybody agrees, though. Lawyer H.S. Phulka, for one, has strong views on Tytlers demeanour. Phulka, who is the counsel for the victims of the Sikh killings, recalls the slanging match he had had with the former minister in a television debate a little less than a year ago. He called me names and abused me in public. Its all on camera, he says. 

 Its been, of course, quite a journey for the Lok Sabha member from Delhi Sadar. Before he resigned, he was minister for non-resident Indians ? a new and not-so-important portfolio in the hierarchy of ministries. Once, though, he was the high-profile minister for civil aviation and later, among other things, minister for surface transport. 

 When he was made a minister in the Manmohan Singh government, there were quite a few raised eyebrows. Among those furiously raising theirs was a group of senior Congress leaders from Delhi. For its no secret that Tytler has his share of foes in the party. In fact, many in the Tytler camp believe that the depositions against the MP in the Nanavati commission were filed at the behest of Sheila Dikshit, who has been involved in a long-standing power feud with him. 

 So, not surprisingly, Tytlers resignation has spread some glee in select Congress circles. Dikshits followers are happy, as is a section of Delhi Congress leaders who had been eyeing a berth at the Centre, but were told that there were just too many ministers from Delhi. 

 Still, its too early to close the Tytler chapter. For the judo enthusiast, any Congresswallah will tell you, is a known survivor. And then, lets not forget, he is an honourable man.

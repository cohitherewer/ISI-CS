 FROM REBEL TO ROBBER 

 Gwynne Dyer

 The implosion of the Irish Republican Army has been so sudden and complete that it seems to defy explanation. For 30 years, the banned IRA commanded the loyalty of a large part of Northern Ireland?s Catholic population, and had significant support in the Republic of Ireland as well. Only months ago, its legal political wing, Sinn Fein, was still seen as a necessary partner in a power-sharing government that would finally restore self-government to Northern Ireland. And now, in a matter of weeks, the IRA has dwindled in most people?s eyes to a mere criminal organization.

 It was real crimes that precipitated this dramatic change. The first was a huge bank robbery in Northern Ireland on December 19 last year. Then came a pub brawl in a Catholic area of Belfast on January 30, in which 10 IRA members, including a very senior officer, knifed Robert McCartney, an innocent fork-lift driver and Sinn Fein supporter, to death. The killers then wiped the pub clean of their fingerprints, took the tape out of the security cameras, warned the 70 witnesses not to say anything and left.

 Iron hand

 That was the standard operating procedure in the old days, when the IRA was seen as the Catholic community?s only defence against Protestants and the British authorities. But seven years after Sinn Fein committed itself to a peaceful political process, it is just murder and intimidation. McCartney?s five sisters, all lifelong IRA supporters, refused to abide by the traditional code of silence and demanded that the IRA hand their brother?s killers over to the authorities.

 Sinn Fein leader, Gerry Adams, invited the sisters to the party?s hundredth anniversary convention in Dublin in an attempt to heal the rift. It didn?t work: the sisters continued to demand that the IRA hand the killers over, and public opinion was with them. Incredibly, the IRA then offered to inflict ?punishment shootings? on the guilty men: bullets through their knees, wrists and/or elbows, designed to cripple but not to kill. The sisters refused, but the message was clear: the IRA is still above the law and it will punish its erring members itself.

 The IRA stopped attacking the local police and British soldiers after the 1994 ceasefire, but it never abandoned violence in Catholic areas: dozens of people were killed for ?transgressions? ranging from drug-trafficking to winning fistfights against IRA members in bars. It didn?t abandon its ?fund-raising? activities either: smuggling, extortion, money-laundering and robberies. 

 Cut the chord

 The British government had long turned a blind eye to these crimes in order not to damage the ?peace process?. But that crashed when the Democratic Unionist Party leader, Ian Paisley, demanded that there be at least photographic proof that the IRA was really ?decommissioning? its weapons. The IRA refused. Then came history?s biggest bank job, followed by the murder and the extraordinary arrogance of IRA, which has evolved into a criminal outfit with a paramilitary veneer.

 IRA active-service units are populated by ?hard men? for whom violence is a normal tool. For the past 11 years, they have been operating exclusively against soft and often highly profitable targets, while the discipline and self-sacrifice that was required for operating against military and police targets melted away. They have turned into a kind of mafia, and Sinn Fein must break its ties with the IRA or face a bleak political future.

 Sinn Fein has split five times in the past 100 years, and three times the split ended in bloodshed. Now it has to split again, and the possibility of bloodshed cannot be excluded. But the chance of a lasting peace in Northern Ireland will be better if it takes the leap than if it does not.

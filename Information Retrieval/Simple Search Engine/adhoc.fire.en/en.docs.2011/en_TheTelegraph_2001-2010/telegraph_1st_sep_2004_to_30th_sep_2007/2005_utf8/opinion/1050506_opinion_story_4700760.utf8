 SILLY GAME 

 Being tarred with the same brush is hardly something to be proud of. Boycotting parliament sessions is not a new tactic, both the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party are old hands at the game. This time though, the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance has not only blackened itself entirely with the brush, but has also managed to go one better. The NDA thinks that the best way to push the United Progressive Alliance into a corner is to boycott parliament during the budget session. Hence a number of immensely important bills, including the finance bill, are being passed, with no argument from the opposition benches. Perhaps the NDA needs to be reminded that its representatives are in parliament because an electorate expects them to speak up for its interests. This is the first task of every elected member of parliament, that he should remember how he has got there. But the NDA has never been able to live down its defeat in the elections. Its behaviour, particularly that of certain senior BJP MPs, immediately after the UPA assumed office, was like that of an unruly gang of spoilt brats, whose favourite reflex was throwing tantrums. There were boycotts then, rowdiness and walkouts ? a very determined effort not to allow the treasury benches any space. It needs to be reiterated that boycotts, walkouts and rowdiness are favoured forms of disruption for every party. But those are not examples that should be emulated. Besides, the NDA has made such behaviour into a wearying habit, perhaps out of a dream gone sour, ignoring the demands of duty, accountability and consideration for wasted public money.

 It would be normal to expect that a step like the boycott of parliament would be prompted by some serious goal, one which could not have been achieved by other means. The NDA, within which the boycott is beginning to cause some discomfort, has been screaming blue murder over tainted ministers for months now; but the subject has begun to pall. Particularly since there has been continuous discussion about it in parliament. What does the NDA want? Obviously, requests from the prime minister and the speaker to return to their seats are not enough. Does it want to muzzle all its political critics? Or does it just want the treasury benches back? For that it will have to put up a better show in the opposition benches first.

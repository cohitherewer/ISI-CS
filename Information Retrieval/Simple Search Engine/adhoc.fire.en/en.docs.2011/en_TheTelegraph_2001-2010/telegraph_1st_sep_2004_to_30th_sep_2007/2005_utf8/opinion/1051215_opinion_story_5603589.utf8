 HUNTING FOR FOOD

 Neha Sahay

 This is the season when expats fly home. All expat activities wind up ? be they ?coffee mornings?, Saturday football, ?ladies? evenings?, quiz nights, Mah jong afternoons, and the rest of the stuff that expats organize to meet one another. 

 Most of the daytime activities are attended by the wives, mostly European and American, where conversation revolves around the lack of good Western food. Every new bakery discovered calls for celebration, and when an entire ?gourmet? shop is located, there?s frantic taking down of addresses and directions. The merits and demerits of the few pizza brands available are a hot topic. 

 It?s amazing how, in the 30 years since Mao Zedong died and the country became a hunting ground for the biggest brands in the West, every conceivable product sought after in the West is made in China, except Western food. Cheese and bread for example. Somehow, only the most basic varieties are available in most Chinese cities, and that too only in the biggest supermarkets. Ditto butter. 

 In South China, Westerners prefer to do their food shopping in Macao and Hong Kong. Indeed, they are known to go to these epicurean havens with large empty suitcases-on-wheels, and come back all hands full, not just with food, but also cosmetics, electronics and branded clothes. This applies specially to Macao, which, after its handover to the ?Motherland?, has been allowed to retain its unique character as a casino city where the world?s tycoons (now increasingly Chinese) come to blow up fortunes.

 The second hottest topic of conversation at coffee mornings is those elusive shops where you get the best Chinese silks and who is the best tailor in town. Chinese girls wear the latest international styles available at every readymade garments shop. But Westerners can?t seem to get enough of Chinese silks, which they get tailored into traditional high-necked Chinese tunics and slit skirts. 

 Another story

 In all this, Indians sometimes wonder what exactly they should say. Asked whether they go cheese-hunting, they reply that there?s enough variety available locally. The exclamations of horror that invariably follow remained inexplicable to this diarist till she befriended a French couple who had spent three cheese-deprived years in Nineties? Calcutta. ?Ah, but what you get in India isn?t cheese,? they declared. Indians of course, experience deprivations of another kind in China, compounded if they are vegetarian. But that would require a separate diary.

 There?s one topic that ranks low on the conversation list at expat gatherings : politics. It?s not just the unwritten ?no politics? rule that seems to prevail, it?s also the general lack of latest political news in the few English newspapers available in South China. After all, how much can one discuss the latest rise in GDP rates, the ever-smiling premier?s visit to Europe, yet another Olympic stadium in Beijing or the new state-of-the-art Metro ? the stuff headlines in the China Daily or Shenzhen Daily are made of? 

 No wonder then, the reason China?s making headlines round the world these days is absolutely unknown to expats here, even in the province where the firing on violently protesting farmers took place last week. There?s not a breath of this in the headlines, and few expats read beyond them. Indeed, most foreigners don?t even look at the Chinese English papers, preferring to surf the net for their own papers. 

 It?s only to those who take the trouble to read the edit page, or the briefs, that the turmoil brewing in rural China becomes visible. Not that expats are uninformed; everyone knows there?s tremendous poverty out there. Many expats try to do some charity within their city, specially with orphanages. But violent unrest? That?s another story.

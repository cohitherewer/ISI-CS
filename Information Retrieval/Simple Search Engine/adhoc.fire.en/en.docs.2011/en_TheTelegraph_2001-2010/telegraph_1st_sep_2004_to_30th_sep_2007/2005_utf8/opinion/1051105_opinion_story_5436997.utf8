 MORE LOYAL THAN BRITISH

 In asking eligible immigrants to pass a ?34 test of Britishness before they are offered their red passports and the worldwide protection of Her Majesty?s Government, Whitehall may well consider using the story of Nirad C. Chaudhuri in a promo. That incorrigible Bengali babu, who spent the last 30 years of his life in Oxford, was fond of boasting of his intimate knowledge of the streets of London, decades before he even set foot in the Mother Country. Chaudhuri was, of course, also an Englishman who never needed a British passport to establish his identity. He was both Indian and English, and never once suffered the ubiquitous ?crisis of identity? which has made sociology a growth industry in the West. Chaudhuri was the creation of Empire at a time when all good colonials were Westernized Oriental Gentlemen and natural ?coconuts?. Yet, they were always a long, long way from Tipperary, Piccadilly and Leicester Square. Neither Benjamin Jowett, the venerable Master of Balliol who inspired his students to undertake England?s ?mission? in India, nor Lionel Curtis, the pioneer of responsible government in the colonies, could have imagined a situation where Bradford and Birmingham would become extensions of Mirpur and Oval the home ground of the West Indies. ?Overpaid, oversexed and over here,? they said about the GIs who saved Albion from Hitler. They may well be saying the same for the Asians who buy their way into the House of Lords. 

 England ? as opposed to Scotland and Wales ? was always a paradox. In collective experience, it was always a potpourri of globalism with quaint cottages in the Home Counties and the Cotswolds flaunting exotic names like Abbotabad and Jalapahar. Good curry was as much a part of ?Asia Minor?, as Bayswater used to be called before the War, as jam roly-poly was central to the Civil Lines. ?These men,? the redoubtable Lord Salisbury rued in 1877 after a visit to a gentleman?s club, ?have the feelings towards the Punjab of an Old Etonian or Old Harrovian towards their schools.? Ironically this spirit of empire preference was coupled with an inexplicable distaste of the ?foreigner?. The Jam Saheb was fine, even if he was a shade too flashy, in both taste and in cricket, and Nehru, as Dickie Mountbatten always maintained, was ?one of us?. 

 The problem was those lesser cousins of Inky who came over after 1950 and never went back. They were nominally British, spoke pidgin and worked awfully hard. Their women ? one saw some of them at Heathrow ? were a breed apart. They lived 30 years in London without knowing either the language or the streets. And then came the fanatics from the bazaars with the message to herald a London-istan in Eurabia. They too acquired British passports without swearing even a nominal oath of allegiance to either Queen or country, never mind drinking the Loyal Toast. Last summer, they blew up London without even saying sorry. If only they had been taught the difference between the Empress of Blandings and the Duchess of Cornwall.

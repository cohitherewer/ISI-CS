 LOCAL HELP WHEN NEEDED

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the government of India?s status report on Disaster Management in India, August 2004 

 District and local level: The district administration is the focal point for implementation of all governmental plans and activities. The actual day-to-day function of administering relief is the responsibility of the collector/ district magistrate/ deputy commissioner, who exercises coordinating and supervising powers over all departments at the district level. Though it may not be a common phenomenon, there exists by and large in districts also a district-level relief committee consisting of officials and non-officials. 

 The 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments recognise panchayati raj institutions as ?institutions of self- government?. The amendment has also laid down necessary guidelines for the structure of their composition, powers, functions, devolution of finances, regular holding of elections and reservation of seats for weaker sections including women. These local bodies can be effective instruments in tackling disasters through early warning system, relief distribution, providing shelter to the victims, medical assistance etc. 

 Other than the national, state, district and local levels, there are various institutional stakeholders who are involved in disaster management at various levels in the country. These include the police and para-military forces, civil defence and home-guards, fire services, ex-servicemen, nongovernment organizations, public and private sector enterprises, media and HAM operators, all of whom have important roles to play. 

 Armed forces: The Indian armed forces are supposed to be called upon to intervene and take on specific tasks only when the situation is beyond the capability of civil administration. 

 In practice, the armed forces are the core of the government?s response capacity and tend to be the first responders of the government of India in a major disaster. Due to their ability to organize action in adverse ground circumstances, speed of operational response and the resources and capabilities at their disposal, the armed forces have historically played a major role in emergency support functions such as communications, search and rescue operations, health and medical facilities, transportation, power, food and civil supplies, public works and engineering, especially in the immediate aftermath of disaster. 

 Disaster management plans should incorporate the role expected of them so that the procedure for deploying them is smooth and quick. 

 External linkages: The government of India is a member of various international organizations in the field of disaster response and relief. While, as a policy, no requests for assistance or appeals are made to the international community in the event of a disaster, assistance offered suo moto is accepted. Linkages exist with the following organizations:

 a) UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which has been made responsible by UN general assembly mandate for all international disaster response.

 b) United Nations Development Programme, responsible for mitigation and prevention aspects of disaster management.

 c) UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination System.

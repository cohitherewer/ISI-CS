 Letters to Editor

 In the net, at last

 Sir ? It is heartening to know that the dreaded underworld don and the prime accused in the 1993 Mumbai blasts, Abu Salem, has been extradited to India from Portugal after three years of tireless effort from the CBI (?Got ?em: Don and his girl?, Nov 12). Although it is being reported that Abu Salem has ?started talking? and is ?cooperating? with the CBI, the latter has to tread very carefully to present a foolproof case. With the judge of the special TADA court expressing his disappointment at having to hear the case with ?pre-conditions? attached (no death penalty and a maximum sentence of 25 years? imprisonment to Abu Salem, if found guilty) and a battery of lawyers ready to defend Abu Salem, the CBI?s acid test has not even begun.

 Hopefully, the CBI will do its ?homework? properly so that a dreaded criminal like Abu Salem cannot fool the system and escape this time round.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? The ?homecoming? of Abu Salem and Monica Bedi should be considered as one of the most significant events in the recent history of India. The government machinery, which has quite a few incidents of bungling under its belt, should now leave no stone unturned to extract the whole truth about Dawood Ibrahim?s network from Abu Salem and his men. Monica Bedi could turn out to be a bigger help in the process than Abu Salem himself. And once the truth is out, punishment to the extent of the death penalty should be awarded to those found guilty.

 Yours faithfully,

Salil Gewali, Shillong

 Sir ? The CBI has done a commendable job in getting Abu Salem extradited to India after a prolonged legal battle. But it should not feel complacent. The legal process, which has already consumed more than 10 years, should be speeded up and the culprits brought to book without delay. The Portuguese government?s condition for extraditing Abu Salem, that the gangster should not be sentenced to death if found guilty, could prove tricky for the CBI and the government.

 Yours faithfully,

Suman Barthakur, Guwahati

 Sir ? Abu Salem?s extradition and arrest have put a healing touch on old wounds in the Indian psyche. The murder of the music magnate and film producer, Gulshan Kumar, and of Manisha Koirala?s secretary, and death-threats to Bollywood actors, directors and producers had put Salem on India?s ?most wanted? list for a long time. But Lisbon?s condition that Salem cannot be awarded the death penalty or a jail term exceeding 25 years sounds patently unfair and unacceptable.

 First, Abu Salem is an Indian citizen. So questions such as: ?Who is Lisbon to give such an assurance to Salem?? is entirely valid. Salem?s case reinforces the need for a uniform anti-terrorist act throughout the world. Else, there will be more 9/11s and 7/7s. The strongest of punishments for terrorists like Abu Salem is the only weapon to wipe out not just terrorists, but terrorism.

 Yours faithfully,

Arunima Mishra, Cuttack

 Sir ? Press reports claim that ?Abu Salem is one of the 50 wealthiest persons in India?. But what is so great about this piece of news? Across the world, white-collar crimes are on the rise and white-collar criminals are emerging as millionaires.

 Just as there is a lot of money in illegal activities, the wealthiest people also thrive on illegal money. It is the proverbial vicious cycle. The loopholes in the Indian tax laws make it impossible for Indians to amass a huge amount of wealth by entirely legal means. 

 Yours faithfully,

M. Kumar, New Delhi

 Sir ? To be branded a ?don? is to gain entry into the elite club of criminals, and a lot of small-time criminals in India look at it as the ultimate goal. The dons live the good life and are not terribly threatened by the law either, since either the top policemen are on the payroll, or powerful politicians count them among their friends. And even if they were to be nabbed, the judicial process in India is such a long and winding road that it is easy to escape through some crack or the other. Given this scheme of things, Abu Salem may be a huge catch, but there is little to feel elated about his extradition to India. He may still have a few aces up his sleeve.

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir ? Abu Salem?s interrogation will hopefully yield not only information about his link with Bollywood and cricket match-fixing, but also lead the CBI to the others wanted in connection with the Mumbai blasts case. The government of India should approach Pakistan so that Dawood Ibrahim, the main accused in the Mumbai blasts case with a possible hideout in Karachi, is handed over to India for trial. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad

 Sir ? The two most quoted ?certainties? in Indian law are ?truth always wins? and ?nobody is above the law?. But reality has always been different. The legal system is always seen to be treating VIPs in a particular manner and the poor and less affluent in an altogether different manner. There is a lot of political and administrative pressure working on the judiciary. All the praise being showered on the CBI is still not enough, because it must be remembered that the CBI secured Abu Salem?s extradition not because of, but in spite of the government authorities. One battle won, the next hurdle for the CBI is to ensure that politicians cannot prevent the law from taking its own course.

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

 WHEN DID THE TWAIN PART?

 Under a single sky

Indian Muslims: Where Have They Gone Wrong?

By Rafiq Zakaria, 

Popular and Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Rs 495

Muslims have never been a majority in the Indian subcontinent. 

But did the Indian Muslims perceive themselves as a minority group during Mughal 

rule or during the Nizam?s rule in Hyderabad? No. As M.J. Akbar rightly argues 

in the foreword, a minority is not a function of numbers but a definition of empowerment. 

As long as the Muslims felt that they were an important, and even decisive, element 

of the ruling group, they did not feel they were a minority.

 British rule and the subsequent Partition was the worst historical tragedy for the Indians in general and Indian Muslims in particular. This book is a collection of Rafiq Zakaria?s articles ? written, rewritten and revised over a period of more than half a century. The book begins with assessing the role of the Muslims in the freedom struggle, and Zakaria does not hesitate to describe how the Indian Muslims were fooled by some of their leaders. According to the author, there were peripheral differences between the Hindus and Muslims before Partition, but under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, the two communities were brought together under the banner of the Indian national Congress. The British government, naturally worried, engineered riots, gave separate electorate to the Muslims and finally adopted the policy of ?divide and rule?. However, the blame rests as much on the Indian leaders as on the British. Jinnah?s obduracy gave the final blow to the country?s unity. 

 Even after Partition, laments Zakaria, the Indian Muslims did not wake up to the ground realities that the creation of Pakistan had thrust upon them. They resorted to the old manner of confrontation with the dominant Hindus. The process has unfortunately continued, with hatred intensified and divide widened.

 After more than fifty years of independence, the Muslims today are just a minority community, whose votes are valuable during elections, but whose welfare is of little concern to those in power. Time and again, communal riots have shown that no ruling party has been able to strike a balance between the power of the majority and the demands of the minority. 

 Zakaria tries to answer the central question that the book throws up: Where have the Indian Muslims gone wrong? According to him, the Muslims have gone wrong whenever they have forgotten their Indian roots. The author prescribes that the Indian Muslims learn to be self-reliant; that they develop themselves as a distinct, forward-looking community, which has little in common with the Arabs or Iranians. The Muslim youth in particular need to be galvanized; they must receive all forms of modern professional and technical education, work hard, compete and excel in various specialized fields. Notwithstanding the differences between the two communities, the ties between them cannot be ignored. Finally, the author stresses that cooperation between the two communities alone can bring prosperity to the country. And this can happen if the Muslims take Hindus to be their partners. Prejudices and suspicions are ultimately counterproductive. 

 Zakaria?s book is lucid and useful for anyone who takes an interest in studying Hindu-Muslim relations, Partition, diplomacy and so on. However, this is still a prescriptive and emotionally charged work which lacks in objectivity and empirical rigour.

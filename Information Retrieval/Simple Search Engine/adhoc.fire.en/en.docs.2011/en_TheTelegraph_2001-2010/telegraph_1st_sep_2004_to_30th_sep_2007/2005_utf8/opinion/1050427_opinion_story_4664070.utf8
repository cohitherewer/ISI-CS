 BLARING OUT

 The British prime minister, Mr Tony Blair, is telling the electors that this is his last elections. In this declaration, there might be more of a recognition of an inevitable reality than a gracious act of abdication. Mr Blair is trying to make out that it is the latter but even if he does get to kiss Her Majesty?s hand after the polls in early May, he will be prime minister probably with a reduced majority but certainly with plummeting public goodwill and declining popularity within the Labour Party. The fall in goodwill is apparent in the number of Britons who are willing to believe that Mr Blair lied to the nation about the Iraq war and took Britain to a war which was totally unnecessary and, according to some, even illegal. What impact the Iraq war will have on the elections is still unclear and unknown, but Mr Blair?s standing in the popularity charts took a beating in the immediate aftermath of the Iraq war.

 Apart from the Iraq war, there is another issue which Mr Blair, unusually for him, has chosen to grasp. He has announced that when he decides to quit, his successor will be Mr Gordon Brown, the present Chancellor of Exchequer. This is to prejudge a decision that will be taken by the Labour Party. Mr Blair is not in a position to choose his own successor. In many ways, this is an unprecedented announcement. As if this were not unusual enough, Mr Blair also declared that after his departure, his policies would be carried forward by Mr Brown. This is not only unfair to Mr Brown, who is very much a man with his own ideas, but it also ignores the unstable relationship that Mr Brown has had with Mr Blair. There are many issues on which the Chancellor is not in tune with his prime minister. For one thing, Mr Brown is not as strong an advocate of New Labour as Mr Blair. For the Chancellor, socialism is still not a bad word and he certainly does not believe that the Labour Party should become another, if milder, version of the Tory party under Ms Margaret Thatcher. Thus, there may not be as smooth a continuity from Mr Blair to Mr Brown as the former presumes. The pledge of continuity that Mr Blair is making rather disingenuously may be a gesture to the traditional Labour voter who might be a bit alarmed that the Labour Party has turned Thatcherite. It is a measure of Mr Blair?s insecurity that he has to make such pledges for the future over which he has no control.

 Letters to Editor

 Finger on the pulse

 Sir ? Team India?s coach, Greg Chappell, has been mired in controversies ever since his appointment. The ?middle-finger gesture? episode is the latest addition to his list (?Mr Chappell, did you make that finger gesture? Yes I did?, Nov 27). From Chappell?s perspective, the reaction does not look entirely unjustified, given that the crowd in Calcutta had been on their worst behaviour with him. Is this what a coach deserves after guiding a newly-put-together team to a convincing series victory against Sri-Lanka? An Indian coach would never have taken the confrontationist route. Chappell?s gesture shows that he is a fighter and undaunted by tough challenges. Maybe he will be able to instil some of this spirit into our cricketers. 

 Yours faithfully,

Khalid Pervez, Calcutta

 Sir ? Gone are the days when the game of cricket meant gentlemanliness, sobriety, and freedom from petty politics. The Telegraph deserves thanks for confronting Greg Chappell, and extracting the confession from him on his finger gesture at the Eden Gardens. The obscene act cannot be pardoned. Had the game of cricket been free from board politics, such a coach would have been asked to quit immediately, instead of being shielded by the men in authority. The question is: do we need a foreign coach (with scant regard for Indian culture) to train our cricketers, when we have the likes of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev, Ravi Shastri and Kris Srikkanth around?

 Yours faithfully,

Basudeb Bhattacharya, Calcutta

 Sir ? The shameless attitude of the crowd at the Eden Gardens during the fourth one-day international between India and South Africa has made me rethink the question, ?Do we live in a civilized country?? Bengalis are known all over the world as a kind-hearted and polite people. But the behaviour of a handful of people has managed to tarnish the image of all Bengalis and Calcuttans. How can we forget that this is the same team which has given us a lot of good cricket recently, winning eight out of the last 11 one-dayers? So what if a player has been dropped, as long as that does not affect the performance of the team? Finally, how did Calcuttans feel when the Indian captain said in Mumbai that the team received support from all the cities except one?

 Yours faithfully,

Moina Khan, Calcutta

 Sir ? Is it becoming of The Telegraph to bay for Greg Chappell?s blood because the prince of Calcutta is out of the Indian team? If the ICC code of conduct for players and team officials is applicable in Chappell?s case, should Sourav Ganguly not have been penalized on the same grounds when he bared his torso and waved his shirt on the balcony of Lord?s? Not a word was uttered by The Telegraph then against Ganguly?s action. The sentiments being whipped up over Ganguly?s omission from the team is counter-productive and ultimately harmful for the team and the player himself.

 Yours faithfully,

Susanta Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir ? The Telegraph?s ?guide? to finger-gestures was amateurish, and clearly aimed at blowing up the Greg Chappell episode. Surely, there are more serious issues deserving front-page coverage.

 Yours faithfully,

Bharath C. Shekar, Kharagpur

 Sir ? Why did the Indian team?s media manager, Wing Commander Baladitya, have to lie about Greg Chappell?s finger-gesture in Calcutta? And if Chappell was going to confess in few hours, why did he have to sit mum beside Baladitya when the injury theory was being forwarded? It is useless blaming the crowd. Surely it is not expected to shower bouquets when the home team, studded with star batsmen, is bowled out for 188?

 Yours faithfully,

Manish C. Bose, Calcutta

 Sir ? Greg Chappell?s finger gesture at Calcutta?s cricket fans is unfortunate and unwarranted. Chappel is going through a phase of cultural acclimatization and deserves to be pardoned. After his team manager had covered up for him by talking about his finger injury, Chappell should have answered no questions on the subject and let it rest. Had he made a confession in his own country, the press and people would have pardoned him and appreciated his honesty. In India, admitting a mistake after committing it is a bigger sin than making it. Chappell should realize that Indians find it easier to accept a hundred white lies than one truth. Chappell is too far ahead of time for Indian cricket. 

 Yours faithfully,

R.B. Easwaran, Chennai

 Sir ? If Sourav Ganguly is charged ? as he has been by Greg Chappell ? with making groups within the national team, then Chappell can be sentenced to jail for making a distinction among the states of India. His days in Indian cricket are numbered.

 Yours faithfully,

Uttoran Sen, Ranchi

 Sir ? Bengalis must be India?s most pathetically insecure people. Nothing else explains the Calcuttans? disgusting behaviour last week, with open celebrations on Team India?s defeat. The idea is that Sourav Ganguly is not only greater than the team but greater than the nation. Pity a people so starved of heroes. Ironically, if any other part of India had reacted similarly to the dropping of someone from their state, Calcuttans would have led the pack in condemning it. But then, Bengali parochialism has never had mirrors. Given the provocation, it would have required a greater saint than Greg Chappell to conquer the urge to show the crowd the finger. It might have not been politically correct, but it was more than justified.

 Yours faithfully,

Biswapriya Purkayastha, Shillong

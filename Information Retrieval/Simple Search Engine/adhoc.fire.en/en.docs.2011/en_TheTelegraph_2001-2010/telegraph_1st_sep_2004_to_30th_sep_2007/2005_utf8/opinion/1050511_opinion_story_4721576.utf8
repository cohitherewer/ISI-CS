 FORKING PATHS

 Which way is the Telugu Desam Party headed now? The most significant recent sign of movement and change in the party?s alignments has been its stance against the opposition in parliament. As one of its ?outside? constituents, the TDP has opposed the National Democratic Alliance?s decision to boycott the remains of the budget session. The reason given by the party was a principled one ? bona fide elected representatives could not be absent from the house. But Mr N. Chandrababu Naidu?s party has been distancing itself from the Bharatiya Janata Party for some time now. Given the strategic shifts of allegiance within coalition politics, moving away in one direction is usually also moving closer in another. Hence, Mr Naidu?s apparently high-minded criticism of the BJP is accompanied by advances towards the left. And this, in turn, also translates itself as a heightened awareness of the presence of the Congress as something to reckon with within this field of shifting alignments. The TDP disapproves of parliamentary misconduct, and it has also now distanced itself from the BJP?s Hindutva agenda. The latter becomes a little less credible on recalling the TDP?s implicit support of the BJP immediately after the Gujarat pogrom.

 High-mindedness apart, the strategic reasons for the TDP?s distancing itself from the BJP are not difficult to guess. Municipal and panchayat elections are imminent in Andhra Pradesh. Mr Naidu has already publicly blamed his closeness to the BJP for his party?s defeat in last year?s assembly and general elections. The Muslim vote, in particular, had been forfeited to this allegiance, especially after Gujarat. The inevitable consequence of shifting allegiances is the return of the Third Front spectre. And here too, the TDP?s bond with the left remains uncertain, with its own fraught history of ideological difference. As recently as April this year, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) had denounced Mr Naidu as ?untrustworthy and unreliable?. This was only a few days after he called on Mr Prakash Karat after the latter became general secretary of the CPI(M). Yet, the haggling over economic policies is often a sign of mutual interest and accommodation, for which the time seems to be particularly ripe. Cosying up to the Congress cannot, however, be an option, given the latter?s tendency to want to swallow up regional parties.

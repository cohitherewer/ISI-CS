 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the WHO?s revised international health regulations, adopted at the World Health Assembly, May 16, 2005

 The following shall apply if a suspect or affected aircraft or ship, for reasons beyond the control of the pilot in command of the aircraft or the officer in command of the ship, lands elsewhere than at the airport at which the aircraft was due to land or berths elsewhere than at the port at which the ship was due to berth: 

 (a) the pilot...or the officer...or other person in charge shall make every effort to communicate without delay with the nearest competent authority; (b) as soon as the competent authority has been informed of the landing it may apply health measures recommended by WHO or other health measures provided in these regulations; (c) unless required for emergency purposes or for communication with the competent authority, no traveller on board...shall leave its vicinity and no cargo shall be removed from..., unless authorized by the competent authority; (d) when all health measures required by the competent authority have been completed, the aircraft or ship may, so far as such health measures are concerned, proceed either to the airport or port at which it was due to land or berth, or, if for technical reasons it cannot do so, to a conveniently situated airport or port. 

 Notwithstanding the provisions contained in this Article, the officer in command of a ship or pilot in command of an aircraft may take such emergency measures as may be necessary for the health and safety of travellers on board.

 Article 29: WHO and States Parties, shall develop guiding principles for applying health measures to civilian lorries, trains and coaches at points of entry and passing through ground crossings. 

 Article 30: Subject to Article 43 or as authorized in applicable international agreements, a suspect traveller who on arrival is placed under public health observation may continue an international voyage, if the traveller does not pose an imminent public health risk and the State Party informs the competent authority of the point of entry at destination, if known, of the traveller?s expected arrival. 

 Article 31: Invasive medical examination, vaccination or other prophylaxis shall not be required as a condition of entry of any traveller to the territory of a State Party, except that, these regulations do not preclude States Parties from requiring medical examination, vaccination or other prophylaxis or proof of vaccination or other prophylaxis: 

 (a) when necessary to determine whether a public health risk exists; (b) as a condition of entry for any travellers seeking temporary or permanent residence; (c) as a condition of entry for any travellers pursuant to Article 43 or Annexes 6 and 7; or (d) which may be carried out pursuant to Article 23. 

 If a traveller for whom a State Party may require a medical examination, vaccination or other prophylaxis fails to consent to any such measure, or refuses to provide the information or the documents...the State Party...may...deny entry to that traveller. If there is evidence of an imminent public health risk, the State Party may...compel the traveller to undergo or advise the traveller to undergo: 

 (a) the least invasive and intrusive medical examination that would achieve the public health objective; (b) vaccination or other prophylaxis; or (c) additional established health measures that prevent or control the spread of disease, including isolation, quarantine or placing the traveller under public health observation.

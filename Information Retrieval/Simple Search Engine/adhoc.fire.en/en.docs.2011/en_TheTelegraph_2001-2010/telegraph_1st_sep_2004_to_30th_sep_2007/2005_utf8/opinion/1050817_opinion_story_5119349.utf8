 INDIA?S SECRET LONGING FOR A PURER MODERNITY

 Telling Tales - 

Amit Chaudhuri

 A still from Satyajit Ray?s Jalsaghar

 Amartya Sen has attempted ? successfully, I think ? to write an erudite but accessible handbook on, and defence of, what is in effect secular Indian modernity (although, tellingly, like other Indians, Sen too isn?t wholly comfortable with the term ?modern?), on its roots in antiquity, and its possible journey in the future. Sen?s idea of situating the modern ?argumentative? Indian in the lineage of traditions of science, scepticism, and rationality that go back in history ? to figures like the Moghul emperor Akbar, a peerless liberal, in Sen?s eyes, and then further into antiquity, to mathematicians like Aryabhatta ? bears some resemblance to the notion of the ?early modern? advanced by certain south Asian historians fairly recently. These historians don?t go back quite as far as Sen does, to texts like the Upanishads, but restrict themselves, on the whole, to the period between the 15th and 18th centuries. 

 In the hands of a historian like Sanjay Subrahmanyam, it?s a fecund and challenging notion; it qualifies, as Sen too tries to, our assumption that modernity in India was the inadvertent gift of colonialism. For Subrahmanyam, this period in India isn?t just a medieval age defined by feudal and religious interrelationships, but a time when certain ?early modern? structures come into place, in institutional practice, modes of dissemination of knowledge, social mobility, the role of the individual, or subtler cultural registers like, as Subrahmanyam notes, the ?shift in the portrayal of the empirical individual? in the painting of the ?Mughal school?. 

 The usefulness of the notion of the ?early modern? is indubitable, although it?s never entirely clear what the Indian ?late modern?, or, simply, ?modern? is through whose filter we?re looking back, presumably, at its early foundations. The methodology seems to be a bit like Borges?s in his essay, ?Kafka and his Precursors?, where the narrator notes wryly that it became possible, after Kafka?s appearance on the horizon, to trace a line of precursors, both notable and obscure, stretching back from him ? an ironical reversal of the orthodox teleology of traditions developing and leading up to a ?great writer?.

 But there?s little doubt that the ?early modern? helps us to look back at history and uncover new formations in it. For me, the psychology of the modern is at least as important as, and indivisible from, its institutional and political context; and, in light of this, I can think of two key ?early modern? moments in addition to the ones our historians have written about. The first has to do with the significance of domiciled natives, or, to borrow from Heaney, ?inner ?migr?s?, to the Indian sense of nationality. There are two crucial figures in this regard: the first is the great 13th-century scholar, poet, and innovator in music in the Delhi Sultanate, Amir Khusrau; the second, the early 19th-century Anglo-Portuguese poet, Henry Louis Vivian Derozio, who lived and died at the age of 23 in Calcutta, and whose sonnets in English to his ?native land?, India, are still studied in schoolbooks. 

 Khusrau?s father, who was Turkish, migrated to India from Central Asia; Khusrau patriotically called himself, by all accounts, ?Turk-e-Hindavi?, or an ?Indian? Turk. Derozio, approximately six centuries later, chose to give voice to the first rumblings of Indian identity as we know it now in his sonnets and poems. Both these men are definitive instances of the journey the ?early modern? makes towards the ?modern?, especially in that they prefigure what we now suspect to be true of Indian nationality: that it not only transcends race, but complicates and perhaps includes within itself the notion of ?otherness? and foreignness. This is why, in the last elections in India, secular Indians who might not have been admirers of Sonia Gandhi nevertheless found themselves deeply uncomfortable with the attempts to marginalize her from the political process because she?s born an Italian.

 The other key ?early modern? moment, for me, involves a transgression ? a quasi-Oedipal one ? that is, everywhere, constitutive of modernity. This is the son?s breach, in the 19th and 20th centuries, of the father?s mercantile, bourgeois status, towards a daydreaming, irresponsible, and possibly artistic life, realigning and reassigning, in the process, the values of the bourgeois order. This transgression is the subject of Mann?s novels, it lies, silently, at the core of Kafka?s life, and is charted in a progression in the history of the Tagores in Bengal, from the life of the entrepreneur ?Prince? Dwarkanath, to that of his otherworldly but landowning son Debendranath, to, finally, that of his grandson (at first, a disappointment in the family), the poet Rabindranath. Might the well-known turning of certain landlords from their feudal responsibilities, before and at the cusp of colonialism, towards the classical arts, especially music (Tarashankar Banerjee?s tragic story, ?Jalsaghar?, about this turn in the life of one landowning family was later made into a film, The Music Room by Ray), be an ?early modern? prefiguring of that bourgeois and profoundly modern transgression? 

 Certainly, one of the most important junctures in the story of colonialism in India, the annexation of Oudh by the British, involves a king, Wajid Ali Shah, who was seen to have abnegated his monarchical responsibilities for music and dance, and is credited with facilitating one of the most popular of semi-classical musical forms, the thumri. From the point of view of the history of colonial, nationalist, and Marxist histories, these abnegations of duty signify decadence, the waning of the Mughal order, the failure of an old social class which left itself vulnerable to either the new, parvenu bourgeoisie or the colonizer. From the point of view of the history of modernity, is not the lapse of the artistic landlord or king an ?early modern? rehearsal of a definitive moment, when the old is transgressed and transformed unrecognizably into the new?

 Probably one of the principal reasons that the word ?modern? is problematic for Indians, that modernity remains, in south Asia, an unofficial and potentially embarrassing reality in spite of being a hegemonic and foundational one, is its filial involvement with the ?colonial?. For many south Asian historians today, ?colonial modernity? is the rubric under which everything that was produced or occurred from roughly the mid-19th century onwards falls ? from the great novels of Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, Hindu oleographs, educational policy, the scientific temper, the railways, the creation of popular culture, to nationalism. But while theorists of the ?early modern? and the ?colonial modern? have tried, often with a high degree of excellence, to describe what actually happened in south Asia in the last five hundred years, one feels that the very terms, ?early modern? and ?colonial modern?, are inflected with a nostalgia for what never did happen, or what might have ? an indigenous, home-grown modernity, in whose narrative the problematic moment of colonialism never occurred. 

 Is it because of this (and not just to pursue a Borgesian irony) that the historians of the ?early modern? never clearly specify what its late phase is ? because it was interrupted and compromised by colonialism? And is this why the status of the ?colonial modern? is never less than ambiguous, and it?s never accorded more than a provisional and slightly controversial acceptance: because Indians believe modernity is both theirs and not theirs, because they feel that it was authored, at least in part, elsewhere? Perhaps this is why the modern in India has been both a hegemony and an inheritance that Indians have been consistently equivocal about; why its features are obvious and also partly concealed. This is a pity, because we?ve never known any other modernity but the one we?ve had: in spite of its privileging of, and investment in, human agency, it?s true we can probably no more choose our history of modernity than we can our relations. The secret, utopian longing, in India, for another, ?purer? modernity possibly explains why we fail to engage completely with the implications and radical achievements of this one.

 IN THE SAFETY NET 

 Moni Nag

 The 2005 UNAIDS global report, which was released in New Delhi last month, has drawn attention to the unique success of the STD/HIV intervention project, (popularly known as Sonagachi project) in curbing the spread of HIV among sex workers in Sonagachi, a red-light area in Calcutta. According to a survey, condom use in Sonagachi rose to as high as 85 per cent and HIV prevalence among sex workers declined to 4 per cent from over 11 per cent in 2001. In Mumbai, by contrast, HIV prevalence among sex workers has been over 50 per cent since 2000.

 Awareness about the pandemic remains woefully low among sex workers,despite the best efforts of the government and NGOs. A national survey has found that while many sex workers had heard of the disease, a vast majority of them did not have adequate information on how to prevent transmission. Many sex workers reported that most of their clients are reluctant to use condoms as a result of which they are forced to have unprotected sex with them.

 The UNAIDS report has attributed the success of the Sonagachi project to the programmes that empower sex workers like the ones carried out by the Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee, an association of sex workers. Prior to the inception of Durbar, if a sex worker turned down a client for his reluctance to use a condom, he could easily find another woman who would be willing to entertain him sexually without asking him to use one. Durbar has helped sex workers to fight for their basic rights, including the right to keep themselves free of diseases.

 Many roles

 Presently, Durbar, the largest and most effective sex workers? association in the world, has about 60 centres all over West Bengal and has a membership of over 60,000 and has undertaken various programmes for the benefit of sex workers. For instance, it has launched the Usha multipurpose cooperative society limited to free sex workers from the terrible exploitation at the hands of unscrupulous moneylenders and brothel-keepers who charge exorbitantly high interest rates on loans. 

 Music and dance performances by members of Komal Gandhar, the cultural forum of Durbar, have received favourable reviews both at the national and international level. Durbar also runs an adult literacy centre for sex workers. There are educational assistance centres for their children and a vocational training centre for the children of retired sex workers too. In addition to a few telephone hotline services, Durbar has also opened a counselling centre in the city to help sex workers get tested for the disease and receive counselling if necessary.

 Recently, the organization also organized three national conferences of sex workers in Calcutta?s Salt lake stadium. These conferences played a significant role in changing public perception on issues such as prostitution in India and gave a fillip to sex workers? morale in the country.

 Durbar also runs a newsletter, Namaskar, published both in Bengali and English. Four other books that summarize the organization?s achievements are informative and well-written.

 It is perhaps ironic that AIDS, which poses the greatest threat to sex workers, is also responsible for providing them with an opportunity to empower themselves. There have been numerous attempts to prevent the entry of women, men and children into prostitution and to rehabilitate those engaged in it. Most of them have failed. One effective way to deal with the problems related to prostitution is to help sex workers to empower themselves so that they can have sufficient control over their lives. In addition, one also needs to cooperate with them to ensure that none of their children, or anyone else for that matter, is forced to enter prostitution.

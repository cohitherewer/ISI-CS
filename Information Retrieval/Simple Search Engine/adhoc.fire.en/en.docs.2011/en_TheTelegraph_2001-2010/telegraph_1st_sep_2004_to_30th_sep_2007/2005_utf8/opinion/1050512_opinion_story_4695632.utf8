 LOOK EAST, DIFFERENTLY

 India has to do some tough talking with Bangladesh, which is no less a menace than Pakistan, writes Sumanta Sen

 Past conquests

 In 1971, when East Pakistan had launched the struggle for freedom with support from India, the Chinese had said, ?India is riding a tiger?. The words had then been dismissed as another expression of China?s anti-Indian and pro-Pakistan stand, and even today not many in this country would agree with it. But the fact remains that in the last three decades, Bangladesh has gradually turned out to be a larger problem on the eastern front than the erstwhile East Pakistan had been.

 The latest border incidents are entirely in keeping with the intransigence of that country. People living along the border in India are under constant threats of marauding raids from the other side and the theft of cattle. Dhaka pays no attention to official complaints regarding this or about the larger issue of harbouring insurgents from the north-eastern states. It is no longer a secret that Bangladesh has been allowing its territory to be used by Pakistan?s Inter-Services Intelligence for creating disturbances in eastern India. But Dhaka behaves as if it has never even heard of that organization. 

 There are people in India who believe that this is because the Bangladesh Nationalist Party is in power and it has to be up in arms against the secular neighbour because of its strong Islamic credentials. One wonders if this is wholly true. If the BNP is hand-in-glove with the fundamentalist forces in its country, it must also be remembered that the Awami League had sought to come to terms with the same forces. Complaints against ISI activities during the regime of Sheikh Hasina Wajed had met with the same fate. So it does appear to be a bit fanciful to hope that things will be hunky-dory if she returns to power again.

 Both the current prime minister, Begum Khaleda Zia, and her principal opponent, Sheikh Hasina Wajed, have to keep in mind the dominant popular mood and that mood has, since 1971, become anti-Indian. One remembers a visit to Dhaka in the early Eighties to cover a presidential election. In the run-up to the polls, the streets rocked with the slogan, ?Hasina re Hasina, tor kathay nacina/Tor baper kathay naica, desh dichhi baica?(Hasina, we don?t dance to your tune, we danced to the tune of your father and sold our country). The Awami League lost the election and though it later returned to power, it no longer had the same popular support it had before and immediately after the creation of the new country. Sheikh Hasina knows this and has naturally had to make compromises. So no real hope lies with her.

 New Delhi has itself to blame for this. Right from the beginning, India has treated the Awami League as being synonymous with Bangladesh. It ignored the other political forces, particularly the left, despite the fact that its boys had fought the war. Even the men of the Pakistan army, who had risen in revolt and fought on different fronts, were treated as nothing more than soldiers who would return to the barracks when Bangladesh came into existence. Worse, after his release, even Sheikh Mujibur Rahman thought it best to view things through India?s eyes.

 With time, the Awami League began to lose support and ultimately Sheikh Mujib had to pay the price with his life. All that is ancient history. But it has to be kept in mind that the anti-Awami League sentiment engulfed India also and the latter came to be viewed as a colonial power, seeking to subjugate Bangladesh in cohorts with the League. 

 New Delhi did not learn any lesson and the Indian high commission in Dhaka acted as a second home to the Awami League. This worsened the situation, particularly in the context of Bangladesh having become an Islamic state. Today, it is not just India that is seen as the big bad wolf. The minorities in Bangladesh as also the saner elements are periodically subjected to harassment and even physical liquidation. To a large extent this is because India put all its eggs in the Awami League basket.

 Now, perhaps, the time has come to take a new look at things. India would certainly do well to forget 1971, to forget the help that had been extended to millions of refugees. Gratitude was expected but no individual and certainly no nation wishes to remain grateful for all times. Also, as Bangladeshis point out, the support from India was certainly not selfless. 

 So forget the past and treat Bangladesh as a nation that has become somewhat of a menace. Having a small neighbour is always a problem. But Dhaka must be made aware of its real station. With India?s relations with China and even Pakistan on a much more even keel today, realpolitik would demand a firmer stand than before. Bangladesh must be made to realize that it will be in its interest not to be trigger-happy at the borders or to open its doors to all kinds of undesirable elements. As the first measure, it would certainly help if work on the fence is stepped up. Even though the ?friendly? Awami League may not take too kindly any show of firmness on India?s part, but in international relations national interest should be India?s main concern, irrespective of past relations.

 A problem that this state faces vis-?-vis Bangladesh is the sentimentality of a section of the Bengali intelligentsia. Rabindrasangeet is alright, but can the fact that it is sung better across the border be a guide to our relations with a belligerent Dhaka? Strangely, this section also wants India to cross swords with Dhaka on non-issues like providing shelter to an individual writer. It is a pity that it does not realize that it would be of no help to New Delhi to be mail- fisted where the situation does not warrant it. 

 At other times the Bengali intellectuals tend to view Bangladesh as some kind of a chosen land, even as books written in Calcutta are pirated in Dhaka. It is also time they realized that the ?amar sonar bangla? sentiment can have no relevance in a situation which demands tough talking and tough acting. 

 If India has talked tough in the West and not suffered, then why should it not do the same in the East as well? Right now everybody is worried, and rightly so, over the proxy war that Islamabad is fighting in Kashmir. The same concern should also be shown for the game that Dhaka is playing in West Bengal, Tripura and Assam. Unfortunately, Kashmir is closer to New Delhi in every sense than the eastern states. But the time has come to ?look east? and not just for the purpose of commerce.

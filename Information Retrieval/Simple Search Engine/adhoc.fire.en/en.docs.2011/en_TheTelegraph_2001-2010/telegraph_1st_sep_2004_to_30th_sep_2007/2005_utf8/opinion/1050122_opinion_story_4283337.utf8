 GAME

 FOR

 MORE

 The importance of being Sania Mirza goes beyond what she gained or lost yesterday. It?s about changing the attitude to women?s tennis in India

TEEN 

TRIVIA

 Sania hated 

mathematics in school 

 She enjoys listening to rap and remixes

 She idolises Steffi Graf

 She was named Indias brand ambassador in 

2004 for the year of the girl child.

 Some things are just not expected to happen. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad is not likely to drop Ayodhya. India won?t defeat Brazil in football. Mallika Sherawat is not going to wear a burqa. And until a few days ago, you would have said that an Indian woman tennis player would not play in the third round of a Grand Slam tennis tournament.

 But this week there was an insurrection of sorts. And, at its vanguard stood an 18-year-old teenager from Hyderabad with a golden nose-ring who loves listening to Eminem, watching Friends on television and hitting the tennis ball harder than any Indian woman before. At the Australian Open, Sania Mirza put the tennis world on notice with a letter of intent.

 Statistics, as Navjot Singh Sidhu likes to stress, are like bikinis; they hide the vital part. And on this occasion, the unflattering scoreline, 1-6, 4-6, will never reveal how Sania matched the mighty Serena Williams, shot for shot, in the second set. Nobody should ever be surprised again watching an Indian woman play in the third round of a Grand Slam tennis tournament.

 But the importance of being Sania Mirza goes far beyond her earlier triumphs over Australia?s Cindy Watson or Hungary?s Petra Mandula, ranked 82 spots above her in the Women?s Tennis Association rankings. Her Friday noon show was about shifting the goalposts, raising the benchmark and changing the way people think about women?s tennis in India.

 In a sense, Sania?s performance also encapsulates the expanded, extra-large global vision of the young in new millennium India. Unlike those in the past, the five-foot, seven-inch-tall, Mumbai-born sportswoman is not satisfied with the crumbs and the lesser life of satellite tours. She has the muscle, the self-belief and the forehand to make a mark on the world stage. Sania is an original Generation Now pin-up: an urban, attractive, articulate, English-speaking, sporty spice girl.

 In hometown Hyderabad, her star power is already filling the stadiums. And if Internet chat rooms are any indication, even her online admirers abound. The advertisers already know this. As the catchline in the Atlas Cycle endorsement, shown throughout her match with Williams, rightly says, it?s the age of girl power. Tata Tea is making her smile as she sips tea. One can already visualise the next Amul billboard: You are my Sania.

 From Anu Peshawaria to Nirupama Mankad to Nirupama Vaidyanathan ? Indian women?s tennis has made painfully slow progress over the decades.

 But those who have interacted with Sania at close quarters believe that what separates her from others is the winner?s mentality. ?Everytime she steps on court, Sania thinks she can win. That apart, she also plays the modern power tennis game like no Indian before,? says Enrico Piperno, the non-playing captain of the Indian Federation Cup team.

 Sanaa Bhambri, who partnered her to the French Open girls? doubles semifinal in 2003, offers a peek into the Mirza steel. The duo was down 0-4 in the quarters when the Hyderabad girl came up with the diktat: ?We are not going to miss any balls from now. Let us see how we are not going to win this match.? They won.

 It?s an attitude, some feel, that borders on arrogance. But which, perhaps, also comes from a supreme self-belief in her abilities. As tennis player Sandeep Kirtane, who was the travelling coach of the Indian team during a Southeast Asian tour, elucidates, ?During a match in Thailand, Sania kept going for her shots though she was down by three match points. And, incredibly, also managed to win.? Recalls Harsha Bhogle, who interviewed her for his programme, Harsha Unplugged: ?She seemed to have a confidence that excited me.?

 Though Sania was born into a cricket-loving family ? former Indian Test captain Ghulam Ahmed was a distant uncle of father Imran ? she was introduced to tennis when she was six. On phone from Saudi Arabia where he is on Haj, Imran recalls, ?You could see from the first day that she was special.?

 When she started playing junior tournaments, Imran ? a builder by profession ? and his wife Nasima would drive to places as far and apart as Ahmedabad and Coimbatore in an old diesel Esteem for the fledging sportswoman. As early as at 14, she was travelling abroad. As former national champion Rushmi Chakravarti says, ?She was never short of the right international exposure.?

 And soon, like Leander Paes, Sania was showing the uncanny ability of lifting her game on to the grand stage. And winning tournaments which no Indian had won before ? such as the junior Wimbledon doubles. Or, claiming the WTA doubles title in Hyderabad. And now, another first ? reaching the last 32 in the Australian Open.

 There are still some creases to be ironed out. A poor serve, for instance. But with a good sponsor (GVK Group), a good back-up system (Mahesh Bhupathi?s company, Globosport manages her) and a good coach (Bob Brett), Sania can only get better. It?s all about working hard, staying focussed and saying your prayers regularly, as she does now.

 For the time being, perhaps, her father can buy her the Chevorlet Optra she had asked for on her 18th birthday last November. After the Australian Open showing, she deserves it.

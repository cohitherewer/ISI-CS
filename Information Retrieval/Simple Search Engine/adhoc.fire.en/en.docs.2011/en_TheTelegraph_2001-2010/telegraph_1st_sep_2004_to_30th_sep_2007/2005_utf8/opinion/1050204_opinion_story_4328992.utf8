 Letters to Editor

 Goodness gracious

 Sir ? Yes, ?imagine a world without Angelina Jolie.? (?Do-gooder derby at Davos?, Jan 31). Or for that matter, without Sharon Stone, or Susan Sarandon. Where would the hapless thousands of Darfur, or Somalia or the Galapagos Islands be without them? And if the well-being of so many rest on a few elegant shoulders, then Jolie?s decision to give Davos a slip must be front-page stuff. Only it is never quite clear what kind of relief Jolie might bring to Darfur ? where she would rather go instead of Davos ? other than smile her pouty smile. Handling a crisis such as Darfur?s requires different kinds of technical expertise, which the personnel of the UNHCR are expected to possess in larger amounts than Hollywood heroines do. There is nothing wrong if Jolie and the Hollywood do-gooders get good press for their extra-histrionic activities. As long as the real workers too get their due.

 Yours faithfully,

Sunanda Ghosal, Calcutta 

 Endless night

 Sir ? There seems to be a racial aspect to the selective denunciation of genocides, which Indians need not buy. A person of Indian origin who went to school with me now lives in California. He was unaware of the US-backed attempted Pakistani genocide in Bangladesh around 1971-72 until I mentioned it to him last year. Breaking the circuit of silence may make the ignorance and passivity that much more difficult to pull off again. But it seems to be considered necessary only in the case of Europeans, with European examples like the Jews.

 The allies failed to bomb Auschwitz, or the rail lines to it, for obvious reasons. Today?s allies, Britain and the US, have killed about two million civilians in Iraq via sanctions, invasion and torture. The US, even when it is anxious to project itself as a global exporter of democracy, never stopped hailing Pakistan as an important ally despite its being under military rule most of the time.

 I have more Jewish friends than Bangladeshi or Iraqi ones, but it is difficult to believe Jewish lives are more important than Iraqi or Bangladeshi ones.

 Yours faithfully,

Ashoke Dasgupta, Winnipeg, Canada

 Sir ? ?Never Again? is the slogan we hear as the world marks the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. Unfortunately, the evil visited by the Nazis on the human race has been replicated since on other parts of the planet. One nation that has fallen victim to the aggression and genocidal instincts of a larger and stronger nation has been Tibet. The dictatorship in Beijing has decreed that Tibet no longer exists, having been incorporated, at gunpoint, into the ?People?s Republic? of China. It has disappeared from Chinese government-approved atlases, just as Poland and Czechoslovakia vanished from Nazi maps of Europe. 

 Since the invasion by the communist regime of China in 1949, at least one million Tibetans have died at the hands of the occupiers, from torture, mass executions, deliberate starvation, and forced labour designed to kill. More than 6,000 of Tibet?s monasteries have been destroyed and their priceless contents looted or vandalized. Military force is used to silence any hint of opposition and all attempts by Tibetans to let the outside world know the truth about their country. Protesters are branded ?counter-revolutionaries? and are subjected to what Beijing officially calls ?re-education through labour?, a euphemism with chilling echoes of Arbeit Macht Frei in Nazi Germany. They are ?educated? by means of daily beatings, electric shocks, verbal abuse, sleep and food deprivation, and other forms of physical and psychological torture. To a large extent, the fate of Tibet mirrors that of China itself. The regime does to Tibetan dissidents exactly what it did to thousands of Chinese students demanding democracy in Tiananmen Square in 1989. The horrific scenes of Tiananmen were reminiscent of the massacre at Babi Yar in Russia where the Nazis ?re-settled? thousands of Jewish victims by machine-gunning them. Political detainees in Tibet, as in China, who are earmarked for execution, are beaten and humiliated prior to being shot. 

 The occupation police attach cardboard notices to the condemned men and women proclaiming: ?I no longer exist. I am being punished for being an enemy of the people and a hateful parasite?. The awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to the dalai lama in 1989 has helped increase awareness of China?s shameful and bloody occupation of his country. But only a sustained international protest and diplomatic pressure will persuade-and embarrass China into a complete withdrawal from Tibet. We should not encourage the tyrants to think they can buy our silence with lucrative economic deals. The Tibetans risk death when they protest. But we in the free world can act as their voices. There?s little point in chanting ?Never Again? if we stand by and allow it to happen again. As a prominent survivor of Auschwitz said: ?It is the silence that kills?.

 Yours faithfully,

John Fitzgerald, Kilkenny, Ireland

 Sir ? Did the Holocaust really end on January 27, 1945? Yes, the world is grateful to Russians for liberating the Auschwitz death camp in Poland, else few Jews would have survived. On the 60th anniversary of the liberation, world leaders were seen showering their collective sympathies on the Holocaust victims (?World halts to reflect on Holocaust?, Jan 28). Cautious voices echoed the need to save human beings. But killings and human rights violation are still very much a part of the 21st century, in the form of Darfur and Iraq and Rwanda. We cannot brand the 20th century alone as a century of bloodshed and slaughter. We continue to carry Auschwitz with us, maybe not in its magnitude but in different manifestations.

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

 VOTING DIVIDES

 It is too early to determine how much the elections in Iraq will help to create the conditions for peace and stability in the country. Although the voter turnout has been impressive, there are numerous factors that may still continue to destabilize Iraq. The result of the elections held in Iraq will not be known for nearly ten more days, but the main trends are obvious. There can be no doubt that the first really democratic elections in Iraq in recent times have invited widespread enthusiasm. Nearly eight million voters, out of thirteen million registered voters, exercised their franchise despite continued violence and insurgency. Although there may be continued controversy over the precise figures, it is clear that by even conservative estimates a majority of the electorate voted. Similarly, there is good evidence that voter participation was strong in regions dominated by Shias and Kurds, a majority of Sunni voters apparently did not participate as enthusiastically in the polls. The Shias, of course, in a majority in the country, viewed this as an opportunity to win power, finally, through the United Iraqi Alliance. Not surprisingly, they responded enthusiastically to the call of their spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Sistani, to show up in large numbers at the polling stations.

 However, precisely for this reason, Sunni alienation is likely to accentuate as Shias try to establish their dominance in the post-election phase. Unfortunately, therefore, the Shia-Sunni sectarian divide may continue to push the country to a civil war. Moreover, there were reports that some officials were campaigning for the interim prime minister, Mr Ayad Allawi, and the candidates of his alliance. This has further angered the Sunnis, who form the vanguard of the insurgency and the resistance movement. The most important reason for the erosion of the legitimacy of the election is the huge American security presence in the country. A large section of those who voted and stood as candidates are also opposed to the so-called American ?occupation? of their country. The danger, of course, is that if the American forces were to leave Iraq, even greater anarchy may be generated in the country. Finally, it remains to be seen if the democratic forces are able to provide good governance to the country. It would be a real tragedy if the citizens of Iraq were to lose faith in democracy as a result of the elections.

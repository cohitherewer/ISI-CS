 Letters to Editor

 Temporary truce

 Sir ? The report, ?Buddha gets his core way in IT? (Oct 27), actually talks of a compromise being struck between Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and the president of the Citu, M.K. Pandhe. The trouble with the Communist Party of India (Marxist) is that it is a communist party functioning in a democracy. It has to compromise where its dogma is in conflict with progress, and there lies its dilemma. No wonder the CPI(M) general secretary Prakash Karat, is speaking in riddles. He does not answer directly when asked if infotech workers can strike, but quibbles that collective bargaining includes strikes. He is more clear when he admits that trade unions do not have a foothold in the IT sector, but is still willing as ever to find out if trade unionism has a chance there.

 The fallout of this may lead to a division in the party in West Bengal, where pro-strikers still hold sway despite having contributed generously to the decline of work culture. In the future, we will hear more of ?middle paths? and compromises, perhaps till the time people decide that the CPI(M) is truly an anachronism.

 Yours faithfully,

Pradip Chowdhury, Calcutta

 Sir ? The CPI(M) politburo has only resolved to acknowledge the right of infotech employees to form unions and bargain collectively. The West Bengal chief minister, on the other hand, wanted the IT industry to be declared an essential service so as to be beyond the reach of political agitations. Thus ?Buddha gets his core way in IT? is totally misleading. Prakash Karat has cleverly side-tracked the main issue and declared that the Citu has so far not been able to organize the IT industry workers. Therefore, in case of a call for bandh or general strike in the future, the Bengal government, the state party unit and Citu would together decide the course of action regarding the IT industry and its employees. We saw what each of those units did on September 29. The politburo, by juggling words, has given the green signal to Citu to lay its hand on the IT sector. Bhattacharjee has been left holding a lolly ? the assurance of further discussion in the central committee of the party.

 Yours faithfully,

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? The resolution of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) politburo may have resolved matters within the party, but for the industry, the talks were most unsatisfactory (?Cutting wedge?, Oct 28). Like some industries where crucial units are permitted to work on occasion of a strike, sections of the IT sector have to remain operational on bandhs. The resolution also talks of the right of employees to form unions. But this should be the independent choice of employees, and cannot be forced upon them by the leftist cadre. 

 Yours faithfully,

Swarnali Biswas, Calcutta

 Sir ? If trade unionism is allowed into the IT sector, frequent work disruptions will take place, affecting its smooth functioning. This, in turn, will see a decrease in overseas contracts and a consequent drying up of employment opportunities. Experience tells us that most trade union leaders are self-centered people who work for their personal gains. Instead of forming unions, the leaders could keep a vigil on business houses so that they do not violate government stipulations and statutory obligations. The government could, in fact, form vigil committees comprising political leaders and bureaucrats. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Debashree Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? Citu leaders may threaten more shutdowns in the IT sector, but the left should realize that investors are not under any compulsion to invest in Bengal where the transport system shuts down at the first sign of trouble. The recent airport strike at Heathrow has been cited as an example. But our Citu leaders have once again failed to make a distinction between a labour dispute and the utter pointlessness each time the left enforces a bandh in defence of India?s economic independence. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir ? The West Bengal chief minister?s emphatic statement that the IT sector could no longer be forced to respond to bandhs was heartening. The question is why the IT sector alone? Do we hear of bandhs and strikes in China? It is shameful how establishments, big or small, have fallen prey to militant trade unionism in this state. And yet there seems to be no respite. People outside the state and abroad laugh at Calcuttans when they talk of industrial resurgence. 

 Yours faithfully,

Murli Punjabi, Calcutta

 Sir ? After fighting tooth and nail against IT, the Marxists appear to have discovered their new love for this sector. The chief minister considers it a public utility service. But is IT as essential as other services like banking or transport? After having made the state almost devoid of industries ? apparently some 27,000 factories, big and small, are closed in West Bengal ? the chief minister seems to be overemphasizing the role of IT.

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? The IT industry gives its workers a lot more scope than other industries. Employees are free to change jobs and big IT companies have well-established HR policies in place. Trade union leaders need to seriously update themselves about the changing scenario. 

 Yours faithfully,

Abhijit Das, Singapore

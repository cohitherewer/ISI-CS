 Letters to Editor

 Return the love

 Sir ? June 19 has been declared Father?s Day, and this will give some people reason to show some affection for their begetter. Nowadays, we also celebrate Mother?s Day. The question is, is one day of love enough for parents who are forgotten for the other 364 days? Children misbehaving with those who bring them up with love and care is now routine. Look at the frequent reports of old parents being harassed by their own blood. We can celebrate special days for parents only if we do not forsake them for the rest of the year. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Md. Mudassir Alam, New Delhi

 Doubly deceived

 Sir ? A panchayat in Uttar Pradesh let off a man for raping his daughter-in-law and ordered the victim to leave the village (?Kin-rapist in custody?, June 17). And all this in the name of the shariat. It is a matter of regret that government silence on such crimes against Muslim women is encouraging Islamic fundamentalists. A member of the Muslim Personal Law Board has reportedly said that the father-in-law should first be awarded a death sentence for rape as per the shariat before thinking of marriage laws. I wonder if his suggestion will be supported by members of his own community. 

 Many amendments have been introduced in the criminal laws of Islamic countries to provide an effective check on crimes against women. Unfortunately, pseudo-secular politics in India has not allowed the Indian government to do the same here. Progressive Muslims should decide to allow the government to introduce some reforms. These changes might be in areas where Islamic countries have already introduced reforms.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? I don?t know which is a more sinister crime ? sati or rape. But there can be no doubts about the fact that both evils need to be equally highlighted by the media. Though the sati in Rajasthan was elaborately covered by the press and most important, commented on, (?Blind faith in sati?, May 26), the rape of a woman in Uttar Pradesh by her own father-in-law was not given the same coverage. Why has The Telegraph not made an editorial comment on the rape?

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Though The Telegraph regularly reports on various atrocities committed in our country in the name of religion (for example, the coverage on the crime in Madhya Pradesh where a social activist was attacked for protesting against child marriage), it is not so consistent while reporting the atrocities committed in the name of Islamic laws. It is shocking to know that a member of the minority community is using religious laws to escape punishment after raping his daughter-in-law. I hope The Telegraph will report such incidents more frequently. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Monalisa Sen, Calcutta 

 Sir ? It is unfortunate that a qazi should have used the shariat to pass such an inhuman judgment on a hapless mother of five. More shocking is the fact that the husband abided by the judgment and divorced her. Imrana Bibi?s future seems bleak unless non-governmental agencies come forward to help her. Aid and assistance to her should be sustained for a considerable period as once the media spotlight wanes, she is bound to find herself walking the razor?s edge again.

 Yours faithfully,

Ajit Kumar Guha, Nasik

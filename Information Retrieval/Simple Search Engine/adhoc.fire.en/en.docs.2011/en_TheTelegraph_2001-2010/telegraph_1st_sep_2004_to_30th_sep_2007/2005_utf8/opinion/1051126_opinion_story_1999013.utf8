 Letters to Editor

 Suspended belief

 Sir ? ?Salem lawyer works for ?free?? (Nov 17), says Amit Roy. Is he confusing ?fear? with ?free?? It is difficult to buy the idea of a human rights lawyer working for an underworld don (whose job is to deny the right of life to his victims) for the sake of his principles alone. We all think that it is politics which is the last refuge of scoundrels. But we might be mistaken. Look at the number of barristers who have turned politicians ? Nehru, S.S. Ray, Jyoti Basu ? and we might yet be willing to suspend our belief about Salem?s lawyer speaking the truth. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Manish Chandra Bose, Calcutta

 Counting heads

 Sir ? When the Religious Demography of India was first released, it was panned for its absurd identification of India with the sangh parivar?s concept of Akhand Bharat or present-day Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. So incomprehensible was its use of the expression ?Indian religionists?, so patent was its targeting of the religious minorities that it was condemned by all right-thinking people. Exactly two years later, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief, K.S. Sudarshan, uses the opportunity again to instruct his flock on reproduction. Sudarshan has declared his reverence for the prolific mata, the woman constantly producing babies, and brushed aside fears of population explosion. The Kauravas were hundred brothers and one sister. In keeping with the true Indian tradition, that is the target, presumably, one has to aim for. 

 Yours faithfully,

M. Dube, Delhi

 Sir ? K.S. Sudarshan?s prescription, ?Hum do-hamare anek? is ridiculous. We are a democracy based on equal rights of the citizenry, irrespective of religion. Why should the country face a threat if any one community, be it Muslim or Hindu, predominates? Besides, the statistics in India tell a different story. Population growth is intrinsically related to literacy and prosperity. Kerala, which is in the forefront in social progress and education, and has a large Muslim population, has been showing a steady decrease in the minority population. And the Christian population in India has been declining over the last four decades. It was 2.60 per cent in 1971, 2.44 per cent in 1981, 2.32 per cent in 1991, and 2.30 per cent in 2001. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Ram Puniyani, Mumbai

 Sir ? While asking Hindus to produce at least three children, K.S. Sudarshan bandies data from the so-called Centre for Policy Research that shows Muslims and Christians to have reduced Hindus to a minority in Jammu and Kashmir and in the North-east. Had Sudarshan known the history of the two places, he would not have claimed so. Jammu and Kashmir is an erstwhile Hindu kingdom, but has always been a Muslim majority state. And in the neglected North-east, Christianity, which is the dominant religion, has brought about major socio-economic transformation. 

 Hinduism is not a religion, it is a way of life, we are told. Dogmatism and narrow-mindedness is not a part of it. But Sudarshan and his kind seem destined to give Hinduism a bad name. With globalization, the touchy issue of religion and social mores will become non-issues and the likes of loud-mouthed Sudarshan will be relegated to the dustbin of history.

 Yours faithfully,

Pradip Chowdhury, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is ironic that in a country which is grossly overpopulated, one can utter an outrageously foolish comment like K.S. Sudarshan made recently. The RSS, and the other arms of the sangh parivar will end up doing immense harm to the country. Is it better to promote a small family norm for all or make Hindus dig their own grave by promulgating the three-child-family?

 Yours faithfully

Saikat Pandit, Uttarpara, Hooghly

 COPING WITH DISASTER ON ALL FRONTS

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the government of India?s status report on Disaster Management in India, August 2004

 The Eleventh Finance Commission too paid detailed attention to the issue of disaster management and ... came out with a number of recommendations, of which the following have a direct bearing on the plan:

 (a) Expenditure on restoration of infrastructure and other capital assets, except those that are intrinsically connected with relief operations and connectivity with the affected area and population, should be met from the plan funds on a priority basis.

 (b) Medium and long-term measures be devised ... to reduce, and if possible, eliminate, the occurrences of these calamities by undertaking developmental works.

 (c) The Planning Commission... should be able to identify works of a capital nature to prevent the recurrence of specific calamities. These works may be funded under the Plan.

 Development programmes that go into promoting development at the local level have been left to the general exercise of planning. Measures need also to be taken to integrate disaster mitigation efforts at the local level with the general exercise of planning, and a more supportive environment created for initiatives towards managing of disasters at all levels.... Disaster management in India rests on the premise that in today?s society while hazards, both natural or otherwise, are inevitable, the disasters that follow need not be so and the society can be prepared to cope with them effectively... The need of the hour is to chalk out a multipronged strategy for total risk management, comprising prevention, preparedness, response and recovery on the one hand, and initiate development efforts aimed towards risk reduction and mitigation, on the other... 

 Disaster prevention is intrinsically linked to preventive planning. Some of the important steps in this regard are:

 (a) Introduction of a comprehensive process of vulnerability analysis and objective risk assessment.

 (b) Building a robust and sound information database: a comprehensive database of the land use, demography, infrastructure...along with current information on climate, weather and man-made structures is crucial in planning, warning and assessment of disasters. In addition, resource inventories of governmental and non-governmental systems including personnel and equipment help in efficient mobilization and optimization of response measures.

 (c) The entire disaster mitigation game plan must necessarily be anchored to frontline research and development in a holistic mode. State-of-the art technologies available worldwide need to be made available in India for upgradation of the disaster management system; at the same time, dedicated research activities should be encouraged in all frontier areas related to disasters... for a continuous flow of high quality basic information for sound disaster management planning,

 (d) A national disaster knowledge network, tuned to the felt needs of a multitude of users like disaster managers, decision makers, community etc., must be developed as the network of networks to cover natural, manmade and biological disasters in all their varied dimensions.

 TO BE CONCLUDED

 DIARY

 Those still busy trying to read the subtext of LK Advani?s Chennai message have another job on their hands ? decoding Jaswant Singh. At a recent press briefing at the party headquarters, Singh was asked to explain AB Vajpayee?s comments on the RSS. Jaswant wondered for a moment, and finally announced that Vajpayee was like the Ramcharitmanas. When puzzled scribes asked him to elaborate on it, Jaswant said curtly, ?Next question, please?. But the next query miffed Singh too as it was on the Iran issue. Our man with the baritone took out a piece of paper and read out a much-convoluted statement that was high on rhetoric and low on substance. So at the end of the press meet, our journos were miffed as well. Which is probably why they decided to hit him where it hurt most. Yashwant Sinha?s categorical reaction to the Iran issue, in which he called the Congress a ?client of the US?, was cited and Singh asked whether he agreed with it. There was a sharp intake of breath, and a visibly upset Singh said with a drawl, ?What Sinha said is in his personal capacity...I am giving the party?s position.? Got the nuances right?

 Will he or will he not? About 600-odd RSS pracharaks will be meeting up in Chitrakoot on October 21-23 and the million-dollar question is whether they will invite the outgoing BJP president, LK Advani. The party chief had been invited to Hardwar last year when a similar conclave had been held. But then there was no Jinnah?s ghost to scare the khaki-shortswallahs. Sangh insiders say that much will depend on whether Advani gets an invitation to the RSS?s Dussehra function, which is addressed by the sarsanghchalak. Which means all eyes are fixed on Advani?s mail.

 Is Arun Jaitley avoiding the party bosses by any chance? The former law minister has been keeping aloof from all the major developments in the party for the past few tumultuous months. He has neither reacted in favour of the RSS nor Advani on Jinnah. He also excused himself recently from attending the Chennai meet on the plea that he was not fit enough for the long air journey. And yet he has felt fit enough to make two trips to Calcutta to dabble in BCCI politics. No messages there?

 The Manmohan Singh government is caught in another row over its move to grant two-year extensions to the Union home, defence, external affairs secretaries and to the RAW and IB chiefs. The decision has not gone down well with several ministers, particularly Sharad Pawar, Laloo Yadav and P Chidambaram, who absented themselves from the cabinet meeting that took the decision. Maverick politico Subramanian Swamy has pointed decisive fingers, and the BJP might soon look the way he is pointing. The allegations have to do with the unholy ties between the PMO, AICC, 10 Janpath and the bureaucracy. But that?s an old story!

 And now the minorities seem to be losing confidence in the UPA regime. For some inexplicable reason, there has been no change in the high offices pertaining to the minorities, namely the Central haj committee, the minorities commission or the minorities financial development corporation and others. The Congress has people cut out for the job, and yet it has made no effort to change the BJP-appointed heads. Out-of-job members of the party like Jaffer Sharief, AR Antulay, Mohsina Kidwai, Waseem Ahmad, Anis Durrani and so on, have, naturally, taken exception to the matter.

 Missing in action. Now that the BJP desperately needs the services of their villain-turned-politician, Shatrughan Sinha, to draw crowds to its election rallies in Bihar, Shotgun is nowhere to be found. Ever since the party refused to project him as their chief ministerial candidate, Sinha has gone into a permanent sulk. The state BJP however is not particularly bothered since it feels that the villainy of Laloo alone will give it the numbers.

 There are lessons to be learnt from the humble wife of our humble PM. The lady is often spotted in busy market places doing her job without any fuss or security hassles. Sometimes she is getting her own grocery, sometimes her sandals from a South Extension store. Bravo!

 Bovinity seems to be next to divinity in Madhya Pradesh. If you have any doubts, look at the government?s, as also the opposition?s, obsession with all things bovine. If Digvijay Singh once doubled grants for his state?s cattle in a budget-deficit state and Uma Bharti thought of ?self-reliance through tending to cows?, the present opposition leader in the state, Jamuna Devi, could not be far behind. She, however, seems to be suffering from a foot-in-the-mouth disease. Jamuna recently called on the state governor, Balram Jakhar, complaining against the BJP regime?s move to buy 22,000 bulls from neighbouring Rajasthan to improve the cow breed. As Devi spoke, someone from the Congress delegation whispered something into her ears. Devi laughed out loud and could not help herself from repeating what she had just heard. Jakhar too, she was reminded, was from Rajasthan. Everyone joined the laughter, except, of course, Jakhar himself.

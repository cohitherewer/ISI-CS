 Paperback Pickings

 Interesting people love poetry

 The puffin book of poetry for children (Puffin, Rs 175) edited by Eunice de Souza and Melanie Silgardo is an excellent little anthology of poems from five continents spanning five centuries. Modern urban life, with its changing ideas of entertainment, its neglect of the arts in education and its aversion to silence, often results in generations of young people growing up without the pleasures of poetry as part of their everyday lives. This collection beautifully combines pleasure with the idea that poetry makes us better ? more complete, more interesting ? human beings. There are the great poets who should be read by every poetry-loving child ? Coleridge, Keats, Hopkins, Auden, Tagore, Blake, Yeats. But there are also new names from different parts of the world bringing a whole range of lives, perceptions and idioms into this anthology. But here is Edna St Vincent Millay, ?On Hearing a Symphony of Beethoven?: ?Enchanted in your air benign and shrewd,/ With limbs a-sprawl and empty faces pale,/ The spiteful and the stingy and the rude/ Sleep like scullions in the fairy tale.?

 The shaping of modern gujarat: plurality, hindutva and beyond (Penguin, Rs 350) by Achyut Yagnik and Suchitra Sheth is a work of syncretic scholarship which traces the history of Gujarat from the time of the Indus Valley civilization up to the present time. Using academic sources, autobiographies, letters, literature and folksongs, Yagnik and Sethi explore the political tensions, social dynamics and economic forces that contributed to making the state what it is today. The unfolding of Gujarat?s modern history has been determined by its powerful middle class, and future directions would depend on how this section of society resolves global/local tensions and how they make peace with the past.

 Band of soldiers (Puffin, Rs 199) by Saradindu Bandyopadhyay collects five stories set during the time of Shivaji Rao by this Bengali writer of crime fiction, ghost stories, historical romances, children?s stories and film scripts, translated by Sreejata Guha. When 16-year-old Sadashiv is forced to leave his village, he has no idea that he will shortly become part of a legendary band of soldiers, united under the Maratha ruler, and lead a life of strategems, loyalties and adventures.

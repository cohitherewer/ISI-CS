 Letters to Editor

 Insipid taste

 Sir ? If scientists are to be believed, mutton-lovers can now dig into their favourite meat without having to worry about cholesterol counts (?Eat mutton to heart?s content?, Feb 17). But the research has its own pitfalls. For instance, one wonders whether mutton marinated in ?cold tea, honey and garlic paste? is fit to tickle a gourmet?s taste buds. Moreover, spending over 45 minutes in just marinating the meat would be a luxury to most, hardpressed as we are for time. Surely, mutton in its unsafe but savoury form is more palatable than its bland, insipid avatar. 

 Yours faithfully,

Indrani Ganguly, Calcutta

 Hungry hearts

 Sir ?That some portion of the tax that we pay to the government is not going to be squandered any more comes as a relief (?MPs? pleasure trips face axe?, Feb 10). The ?study tours? of the numerous departmental standing committees were a constant drain on the country?s resources. The idea of MPs enjoying pleasure trips with public money is simply preposterous. The speaker, who has led by example and cut down on the number of tours, is indeed a rare politician who has some concern left for the common man and his money. Now it is up to our avaricious politicians to follow the speaker?s example. 

 Yours faithfully,

Soumik Kanti Dutta, Durgapur

 Sir ? It is a shame that the Lok Sabha speaker, Somnath Chatterjee, had to issue fresh guidelines to control the wastage of public money by members of the parliament. But one wonders whether the MPs would take to these kindly. Remember how they were up in arms against the proposal to scrap their daily allowance only a few days back? Our politicians are well known for their avarice and are unlikely to let go of the many perquisites that come with their position. Therefore, one wouldn?t be surprised if the parliament passes a resolution to undo the good work done by the speaker.

 Yours faithfully,

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta 

 Sir ? I have worked in one of the leading public sector units for over two decades and have been a witness to the high expenses incurred by these ailing institutions when members of the Committee on Public Undertakings came calling. The chairman and other officials would then get busy with providing five-star comfort to the committee members, often at the cost of the exchequer. Somnath Chatterjee?s move will hopefully put an end to this custom the next time a politician visits a PSU.

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 Sir ? The decision to do away with the pleasure trips of the MPs is welcome news. Both Somnath Chatterjee and Bhairon Singh Shekhawat should be congratulated for coming down heavily on the many facilities and undue advantages enjoyed by parliamentarians. It is a pity that such a regulation did not come into effect earlier. It could have saved a considerable amount that would have gone into helping the nation?s poor and the needy.

 Yours faithfully,

Diptimoy Ghosh, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir ? Compared to the single-screen theatres, the prices of multiplex tickets are exorbitant. It is true that multiplexes have more screens so that the audience has the option of choosing from a wide range of films. But the ticket prices of no two movies are the same. It would be better if multiplexes introduced a uniform rate for tickets. Otherwise, those who flock to them now may soon head towards their old favourites ? single-screen theatres .

 Yours faithfully,

Indranil Sanyal, Calcutta

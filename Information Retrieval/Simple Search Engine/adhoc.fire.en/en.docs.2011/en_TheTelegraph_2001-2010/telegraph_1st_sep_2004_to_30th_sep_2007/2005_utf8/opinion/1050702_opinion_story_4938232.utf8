 KICKING

 UP A

 STORM

 His free-kicks often touch 130 kilometres per hour. But Adrianos rise up the ladder of stardom has been even faster than that

 ASSEMBLY LINE

 The other boys from Brazil:

 KAKA: The promising midfielder has just moved to AC Milan from Sao Paulo for an estimated $ 8.2 million

 ROBINHO: Currently with Santos but 

 contemplating a move to Real Madrid, he has been compared to Pele for his rhythm

 CICINHO: Has been honing his skills as a full-back in Sao Paulo, and could prove 

 priceless to the Brazilian defence in future.

 Theres news for football fans. The official website of Brazilian ace striker Ronaldo, www.r9ronaldo.com, has suddenly been cleared of all its content and links. We are preparing a new great website, well come back soon! is the only sentence ? in four languages ? that currently stares the surfer in the face. The star himself is on a sabbatical, and has reportedly been making the most of it to rear a Brazilian motorsport team for the forthcoming A1 racing season.

 Blame it on presumption or an abject lack of foresight, but its unlikely that the suspended URL will spring back to life very soon. For the number nine, so unsuspectingly incorporated into the name of the website, doesnt belong to Ronaldo anymore, at least not for the time being. 

 And its equally unlikely that Adriano Leite Ribeiro, who donned that number on his yellow shirt over the last two weeks to slam five goals ? including two in the final against Argentina on Wednesday ? to propel Brazil to the Confederations Cup title, would be settling for a less glamorous digit very soon. Finders keepers, losers weepers, is the one line that would probably scream out of the 23-year-olds official website, if he did have one.

 To the world, the next icon of Samba power seems to have arrived. And like most of the other icons to have rolled off the Brazilian assembly line in the past, Adrianos journey to the top has been a typical beaches-of-Rio-to-superclubs-of-Europe story.

 The boy who grew up in a slum had his first brush with serious football at the age of seven, when mother Rosilda took him to the nursery of Flamengo, the countrys biggest football club. Having started off as a defender, it wasnt until the age of 15 that he was given the chance to play upfront in the clubs youth team. For the man who was to soon turn into a goal-scoring machine, it was a significant development.

 In 2001 ? the year his marksmanship began to show signs of maturity ? Adriano pumped in six goals to finish top scorer in Brazils victorious campaign at the South American Under-20 Championships. He smacked in another six later that year at the Fifa World Youth Championships. 

 With his coming of age as a striker, he was predictably scooped up from Flamengo by Italian giant Inter Milan for an estimated 5 million euros. The figures tell the rest of the tale. Loaned out to Fiorentina by Inter Milan, Adriano hit the net six times in 15 matches for the Florence outfit that season, immediately commanding the attention of FC Parma. 

 Gifted with a magical left foot, Adrianos price had gone up to 17.3 million euros by then ? but it wasnt bad investment for someone who would eventually return 15 goals in 28 games through Parmas Serie A campaign. Back in Inter Milan for the 2004 season at a price of 20 million euros, Adriano continued his scoring spree ? netting 16 Serie A and seven Champions League goals over the last season for the blue-and-black brigade.

 Speculation has been rife, of late, over English Premiership champions Chelsea trying to lap up the Brazilian in a multi-million pound deal. I am happy to know that, but I am happy in Milan where Im treated like a king, Adriano is said to have told the Brazilian press.

 In the meantime, Adriano ? whose free-kicks have reportedly reached speeds of about 130 kmph ? had scored seven times in the Copa America Cup in 2004, taking Brazil all the way to the title. With Ronaldo deciding to opt out of this years Confederations Cup to get back in shape for the 2006 World Cup in Germany, Brazil had pinned its hopes on the striker from Inter Milan to see the country through. 

 Some still saw him as a clumsy striker with a nagging knee injury. Some were sceptical because he had just flown out of a tedious Serie A season with Inter Milan, and it was widely suspected that fatigue would take its toll.

 But Adriano proved them wrong ? doing his job to a T. Poaching instinct at work, he notched the opener for Brazil past a baffled Argentine defence on Wednesday ? leading many soccer fans to believe that his presence in the team would make all the difference to Brazil in its World Cup outing next year.

 Such has been the Adriano magic that Ronaldo himself is uncertain of regaining his position that he gave up for the sake of a much-needed break from the game. And in a squad where talent comes dime a dozen, super-star Ronaldos fears are not entirely misplaced.

 Not everyone, though, agrees with the opinion that Adriano would eclipse Ronaldo in the years to come. He can be a good successor to Ronaldo, but hes definitely not Ronaldo, says veteran footballer P.K. Banerjee. Banerjee believes that while he has strength, is fearless and can play an all-round game, Adriano lacks the speed and deception of Ronaldo. He plays his game in a straightforward manner and not in the typical Brazilian style that has been made famous by the past masters. Ronaldo, along with Rivaldo, had constituted a lethal pair for Brazil in the last World Cup. I think its beyond Adriano to recreate that magic, he says. 

 It remains to be seen if Adriano, having dutifully worn the number-nine shirt through the Confederations Cup campaign, would get to hang on to it in the future. But keeping recent developments in mind, it is to be hoped that the rising star would be more circumspect while picking a name for his own website, if and when he decides to sell himself online.

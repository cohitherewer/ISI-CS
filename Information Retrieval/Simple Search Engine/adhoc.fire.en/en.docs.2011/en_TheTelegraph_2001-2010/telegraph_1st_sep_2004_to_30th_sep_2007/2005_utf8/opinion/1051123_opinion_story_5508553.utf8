 REMOVE THREATS TO GLOBAL SECURITY

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the Human Development Report 2005

 Mineral and other natural resource exports do not create violent conflict. Neither do small arms. But markets for natural resources and small arms can provide the means to sustain violent conflict. From Cambodia to Afghanistan and countries in West Africa exports of gems and timber have helped finance conflict and weaken state capacity. Certification schemes can close off opportunities for export, as demonstrated by the Kimberley certification process for diamonds. Small arms claim more than 500,000 lives a year, the majority of them in the world rsquo;s poorest countries. Yet international efforts to control the deadly trade in small arms have had limited impact. Enforcement remains weak, adherence to codes is voluntary, and large legal loopholes enable much of the trade to escape regulation.

 One of the most effective ways in which rich countries could address the threats to human development posed by violent conflict is by supporting regional capacity. The crisis in Darfur could have been diminished, if not averted, by the presence of a sufficiently large and well equipped African Union peacekeeping force ? especially if that force had a strong mandate to protect civilians. During the peak of the crisis there were fewer than 300 Rwandan and Nigerian troops monitoring what was happening to 1.5 million Darfuris in an area the size of France. Building regional capacity, in areas from the creation of effective early warning systems to intervention, remains a pressing requirement for human security.

 If prevention is the most cost-effective route for addressing the threats posed by violent conflict, seizing opportunities for reconstruction runs a close second. Peace settlements are often a prelude to renewed violence: half of all countries coming out of violent conflict revert to war within five years. Breaking this cycle requires a political and financial commitment to provide security, oversee reconstruction and create the conditions for the development of competitive markets and private sector investment over the long haul. The commitment has not always been in evidence.

 While the millennium development goals have provided a focus for progress towards ?freedom from want?, the world still lacks a coherent agenda for extending ?freedom from fear?. As the UN Secretary General?s report In Larger Freedom has argued, there is an urgent need to develop a collective security framework that goes beyond military responses to the threats posed by terrorism, to a recognition that poverty, social breakdown and civil conflict form core components of the global security threat. Among the key requirements for reducing that threat:

 A new deal on aid: Starving conflict-prone or post-conflict states of aid is unjustified. It is bad for human security in the countries concerned ? and it is bad for global security. As part of the wider requirement to achieve the aid target of 0.7 per cent of gross national income, donors should commit themselves to a greater aid effort, with greater predictability of aid through long-term financing commitments. Donors should be more transparent about the conditions for aid allocations and about their reasons for scaling down investments in conflict-prone countries.

 Greater transparency in resource management: As parties to the natural resource markets that help finance conflict and, in some cases, undermine accountable government, transnational companies involved in mineral exporting should increase transparency. The international legal framework proposed by the UK-sponsored Commission for Africa to allow for the investigation of corrupt practices by transnational companies overseas ? as already practiced under US law ? should be developed as a priority.

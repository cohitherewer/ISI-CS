 BRIBES CAN KILL

 Corruption kills ? and kills again and again. In India, the giving and taking of bribes have become part of the order of nature. The notion of the ethical slides effortlessly into that of the practical ? how to get by in everyday life ? and many things become quite alright. Yet this mix of corruption and apathy could be lethal, and in these situations taking a bribe suddenly becomes an act of brutality. Two children were knocked down fatally by a lorry trying to speed away from an extortionist policeman. There is dispute as to whether heavy vehicles are allowed on that road. But what matters is that this vehicle was stopped by a policeman, and witnesses claim that the negotiation between him and the driver suggests the usual demand of money. A carload of people were killed in January when a traffic constable pocketed two rupees and let a truck into a no-truck zone, where it collided with a taxi.

 The responses of senior policemen to such corruption show another, equally deadly, form of corruption. To say that unless there are complaints made nothing can be done about the matter, or to nit-pick about the particulars of the situation in which the two children were killed is not simple ?inaction?. It speaks of a deadening of conscience and will, a collapse of discipline and alertness, that must also be seen as a form of brutality, particularly in keepers of the law. The fatal lawlessness all over the roads and pavements of Calcutta has also left a survey team appointed by the high court full of horror. A whole network of crimes ? hawkers, roadside food-stalls, illegal parking, bribes taken by the police or by parking touts ? create terrible chaos on the roads that makes it possible for serious accidents to happen at any time. The problem is that this state of affairs is perceived as irreversible by the authorities, not because they are powerless, but their stakes in such crimes, from the lowest to the highest in the hierarchy, are simply too high.

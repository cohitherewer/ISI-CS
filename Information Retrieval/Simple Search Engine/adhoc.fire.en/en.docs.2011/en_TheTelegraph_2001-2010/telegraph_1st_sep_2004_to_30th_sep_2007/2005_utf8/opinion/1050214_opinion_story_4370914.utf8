 VAGUE PROMISES

 The prime minister has set out a wish list for different ministries, listing policy changes to be carried out over the next six months. This reflects commitments made in the national common minimum programme. Since the list has been drafted in consultation with individual ministries, presumably, the government believes all this is achievable within that time frame. The idea of keeping tabs on ministries is laudable. Even greater commendation will result if there is an action taken report after six months. An undercurrent of institutional reform (decentralization, simplification, transparency, accountability, e-governance) runs through all the programmes. 

 Is it specially significant that the list is being released now? Are some of these initiatives likely to be included in the budget? The finance ministry list is one of the longest, with an emphasis not only on value added tax and service sector taxation, but also on government procurement, rural credit, and others, including foreign direct investment. Is the inclusion of FDI an attempt to convey a signal to the left, since the labour and employment ministry list not only mentions social security for the unorganized sector, but also reform of labour laws? Having welcomed this initiative, it must be mentioned that most items in the list are vague and have no clear time frames attached.

 In the cases of the National Horticulture Mission, overhaul of Council for Advancement of People?s Action and Rural Technology, reconstitution of Khadi and Village Industries Commission and reorganization of HUDCO, the time frame given is of six months. But for the rest, the expression is ?timely completion?. That is neither here nor there. In rural development, a focus of the NCMP, it is said that the food for work programme will be reviewed, the National Employment Guarantee Act implemented, rural infrastructure developed and land records computerized and made available online. Wouldn?t it have been possible to pin these down further, with clear timelines and improvements that can be monitored? Or to take another example, Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution promises revamped delivery of the public distribution system and improved functioning of the Food Corporation of India. This is precisely what the finance minister promised in the budget speech for 2004-05. But nothing has materialized. Whatever happened to the idea of introducing food stamps on pilot basis in selected districts? The NCMP, with its pious promises, was a political document. But a governance document should do better. And with this barrage of commissions, councils, task forces and committees, the prime minister?s office should have been able to do better. The Planning Commission has had a programme for computerization of land records since 1988-89. Perhaps ?timely implementation? of the recommendations of the next PMO policy thrust document should have some numbers.

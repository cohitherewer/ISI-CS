 ACROSS TROUBLED WATERS

 Neha Sahay

 So, for the second time in seven months, China?s hostages are back safe and sound from Iraq, but, like the Indian hostages who went through the same ordeal in September, their happiness is not unmixed with worry. They were leaving Baghdad, where they were working for a Chinese company, because they wanted to be with their families for the Chinese New Year next month ? three of them are teenagers. That wish will be granted, but whether they will be in a position to celebrate is doubtful.

 The eight kidnapped this time, and the seven kidnapped in June, hail from Fujian in the east. Despite being one of the coastal provinces transformed by foreign investment, Fujian has been seeing a steady flow of labour abroad from its villages. Some of the villages even have travel agencies. Low wages combined with peer pressure to seek a better life abroad has kept the ?snakeheads? (illegal recruiting gangs) in business in Fujian.

 Chinese villagers follow the same route ours do: paying huge sums to agents, ending up with fake passports; often travelling long, circuitous routes in inhuman conditions to evade being caught; doing jobs no one else would risk their lives for... Last February, 20 Chinese died in Britain?s Morecambe Bay, when sudden tides swept them away while they were cockle-picking. 

 Jobs calling

 Those lucky enough to land the promised jobs, spend years paying off the loans they took to pay the ?snakeheads?. If they die abroad, as a depressingly large number of them have been doing nowadays, their families suffer a double loss: they must repay the debt.

 In April and May last year, 12 Chinese labourers were killed and 13 hurt in terrorist kidnappings/attacks; 11 on a construction site in Afghanistan, one at a port in Pakistan.

 All these incidents prompted a new law last August: only government-recognized agencies are now allowed to send Chinese abroad. Also, firms who bid for contracts abroad and employ Chinese, must take adequate security precautions, to protect their employees. There is also talk of an insurance fund, to which the government, companies and the workers themselves would contribute. The families of the 11 killed in Afghanistan received (at least on paper) 400,000 yuan each from the contractors who had employed them.

 Travel travails

 The kidnappers in Iraq demanded that China clarify its stand on Iraq. In getting the hostages? release, China took pains to point out that it had been advising its nationals not to travel to Iraq. The old Communist stress on ties between people of different countries was also used by it. Finally, it used the offices of the committee of Muslim scholars to intervene on its behalf. 

 Large numbers of Chinese working abroad ? 500,000 are registered officially ? is a relatively new phenomenon. During Mao?s days, there was strict control on movement within China. Guards would shoot anyone caught swimming to Macao or Hong Kong, yet, hundreds did so. This was voluntary migration, not to be confused with the huge government-sanctioned construction projects where Chinese experts helped developing countries.

 Today, travel within the mainland is constant, mostly job-driven. Internationally, China has a list of countries to which travel is officially allowed in groups, and in some cases, individually. Many ?travel? operators actually smuggle labour abroad.

 While this kind of illegal migration is an offence, working abroad is increasingly encouraged; it solves the unemployment problem at home. After the hostage incident, the state-run People?s Daily commented that whatever the compulsions, Chinese wanting to work abroad should first check out the conditions there.

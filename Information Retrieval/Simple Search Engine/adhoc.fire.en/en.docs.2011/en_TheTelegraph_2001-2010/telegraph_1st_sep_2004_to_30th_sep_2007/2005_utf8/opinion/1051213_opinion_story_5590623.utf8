 Exile 

as therapy

 MALVIKA SINGH

 Parliamentarians have put us all to shame. They continue to misuse this institution at the cost of the Indian people. They behave worse than street lumpens. They are no longer respected. As a result, the wastrels in society, those who live anarchic and corrupt lives, follow their example and indulge in unacceptable behaviour in the private and public space. They are responsible for having polluted life and living in our towns and cities. These people are the non-doers, the failures. It is a sad and shameful period that we are going through, one that the great and wonderful land does not deserve. That we can count, on the fingers of one hand, those leaders who have maintained their dignity of person and office by not descending to the depths of impropriety, does not speak well of an energetic and vibrant democracy. The standards being set today are unethical, lack all sense of correctness, and celebrate corruption in all its manifestations. From the prime minister to the man on the street, this reality is common knowledge. Why do our leaders turn a blind eye to this horror and pretend all is well?

 The president of India and the speaker of the house should adjourn parliament, confiscate the emoluments that parliamentarians get, and force all those disruptive men and women to go into exile, into their constituencies, till elections are announced. Compel them to work and deliver the goods rather than shout and scream. Remove them from prime commercial and residential properties in our cities, land that they have usurped from India on the plea that they are the servants of the nation, and put them to pasture to fend for themselves. Let them go out and find jobs, earn a legitimate living like the rest of us. Let them learn to live and grow without state subsidies of housing, job, electricity, water, domestic help, cars and drivers, travel and entertainment, all for free. Force them to give up the dole and free the legitimate tax payers from the burden of supporting these people who care less and less about India with every passing day. 

 Of the same feather

 The same treatment needs to be meted out to the babu who has also become a parasite of society, living off India, eating off India, and harassing India. If both these strangleholds are eased off, Indians will take on the world. The administrators of Hindustan have amongst them some old-time type honest officers with integrity but they are few and far between. New upwardly mobile government symbols that have come to define all that is wrong with our social order are: the red and blue lights atop the ambassador car, the lettering saying ?government vehicle? painted loud and clear on the body, the jumping of an orderly and civilized queue by a PA, the endless delays by petty babus in getting ordinary, run-of-the-mill bits of paper that legitimize breathing the air and living a correct life, the limitless demands for bakshish of some kind or the other only by government employees and beggars on the street because no other professional group descends to this level, the traffic snarls due to the movement on public streets by those who need ?protection?. Where are those dignified and humane leaders of modern India who set the parameters of a contemporary nation-state? 

 Like after a severe earthquake, when rebuilding is the first concern, India too has to reconstruct its working and living environment which has been reduced to rubble. Our institutions are in a shambles, ridden with a cancer that does not seem to leave us. Harsh chemotherapy is the call of the day and only a prime minister such as Manmohan Singh, who does not carry the puerile baggage of present Indian politics, could, if he chooses not to be dictated by his bureaucrats, initiate the change which will lead to a manthan, a much- awaited one.

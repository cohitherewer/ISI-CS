 TOO CLOSE TO THE HEART

 Alone together

Truth or Dare: A Book of Secrets Shared

Edited by Justine Picardie, 

Picador, pound; 12.99

Does one have more secrets as a child or as a grown-up? 

And how, if at all, does the nature of our secrets change as we grow older? What 

does the telling, or sharing, of a secret entail? And why, in a game of Truth 

or Dare, is telling the truth as difficult as, or often more difficult than, an 

act of daring? When one is sharing a secret, is one telling the truth? Or, is 

it a lie, since (as Lacan, quoted in the introduction, wrote) ?there is no truth 

that, in passing through awareness, does not lie??

 Eleven authors share their secrets in this book. If the commissioning editor?s introduction is included, which it can well be, there are a dozen narratives. It is interesting to note that as many as three are about fathers. What makes the connection even more significant is that all three are written by women. Sabine Durrant?s ?At Sea? is about the author?s piecing together of her father?s life out of tiny details and clues gathered from army museums, and from her final confrontation with her mother?s memories. Julie Myerson, too, reconstructs her father?s life, juxtaposing newspaper reports of his success as a maker of aeroplane models with details from familial sources. Zoe Heller gives a delightful account of spending vacations with her father and his many girlfriends, and the Freudian connection comes full circle when she reveals that she married a man sixteen years her senior, who wrote Hollywood screen-plays, just as her father did. 

 The men, with the exception of William Fiennes, write about their children. So does Rachel Cusk. Jon Ronson takes his four-year-old son to meet Santa Claus in Lapland; Nick Hornby takes his six-year-old autistic son to the park. Both are trying to do something their sons would love, and yet, they realize, they are doing what they think their sons would love. In Ronson?s case, the Lapland trip is to become a travel article, so that he can ?provide Joel with a magical and unforgettable Christmas, do it all for free, and give my son a unique gift too ? the gift of fame.? When he sees his son, deprived of sleep to accommodate the whirlwind tour, on the magazine cover, he realizes he ?can never write about Joel again?.

 Taking his son to the park means that Hornby refuses him the certainty of a familiar route which leads to his grandmother?s house. The daily struggles ? often conducted in public ? with the child sometimes attract strangers in a mood to reproach a cruel parent. It is on days like these that Hornby silently dares ?someone to say or do something, just so as I can tell them why I?m having to be so cruel, and hopefully make them feel terrible in the process.?

 Cusk?s negotiations with her daughters also brings her face to face with her imminent middle age, when one looks ?effaced and sexless, like plain-clothed nuns?. 

 There are old loves ? Sophie Dahl?s, Fiennes?s and Picardie?s ? and new ones ? Andrea Ashworth?s. But, strangely, no significant adulterous ones. There?s a rape victim, Alice Sebold, who debunks the idea of calling herself by any other name, rape survivor, for instance. And then there is Esther Freud?s account of the changing meaning of Thursday: from a day associated with the shame of urinating in the middle of a class to one linked with the experience of romantic love. 

 In the game of Truth or Dare, telling the truth is actually a kind of dare. It requires courage, candour, and most difficult of all, asking oneself uncomfortable questions. All twelve authors win.

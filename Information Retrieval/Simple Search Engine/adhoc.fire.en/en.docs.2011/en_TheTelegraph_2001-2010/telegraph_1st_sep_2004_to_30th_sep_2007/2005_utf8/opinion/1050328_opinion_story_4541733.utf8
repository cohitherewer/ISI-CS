 NOT IN HEAVEN

 Rescue fantasies are undesirable, especially when they are attributed to the judiciary. But such is the tragic failure of administration throughout the country that public interest litigations seem to have become a kind of last straw to clutch at. In response to a recent PIL, the Supreme Court has directed all collectors and superintendents of police to see to it that child marriages do not take place during the forthcoming festivals next month. The practice of marrying off children during Ram Navami and Akha Teej is most prevalent in Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. This tradition has not been affected by either the Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929 or the threat of the prevention of child marriages bill, 2004. If anything, marrying off children is now a flourishing social custom in a large part of India, associated with prestige and ceremony. Such practices, rather than the usual heartening statistics, should be held as true indicators of the spread of education. Little girls are taken out of school, sometimes even before puberty, to be given away in marriage, not only during particular festivals or in specific states, but all the time and everywhere in the country. The under-age brides are used as free labour, sex objects and procreative machines, while the piles of data that are now available act as quantifiable markers of the cruelty and indifference that underlie such exploitation.

 This may be one more illustration of the fact that law by itself cannot change society. But what about the law-enforcers? Their passivity may spring from habitual neglect of duty, or political expediency, or compliance with popular opinion, or unshakeable belief in the value of old practices, even when evil or illegal. None of this is excusable. What comes through at the end is the issue of priorities, with the welfare and rights of women and children almost invisible at the very bottom of the list. Law?enforcers in India reflect the attitudes of society in such issues instead of upholding the law. The rot permeates the entire structure: registration of marriages has not been made compulsory in spite of the Supreme Court?s earlier instructions. Registration would have protected children. An active administration cannot effect immediate social change either, but deterrents could be a useful way to start the process.

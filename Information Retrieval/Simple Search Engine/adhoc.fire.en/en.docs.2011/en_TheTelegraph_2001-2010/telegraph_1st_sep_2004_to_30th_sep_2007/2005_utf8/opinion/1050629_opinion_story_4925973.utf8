 SPEAK SOFTLY

 What politicians say is often less important than why they say so. This perhaps is the best way to understand the real import of Mr Yashwant Sinha?s fulminations against his party colleague and Jharkhand chief minister, Mr Arjun Munda. To say this is not necessarily to deny the validity of many of Mr Sinha?s complaints. Several of his charges ? from the government?s poor record in development work to its failure to provide basic amenities such as water, power and health services to the people, and corruption ? do not seem to be totally baseless. Not just the opposition parties, but even senior leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party, such as Mr Karia Munda, have made similar complaints. There are other indicators which suggest that Mr Munda?s second term in office has little to show for itself. The chief minister has clearly busied himself more with keeping an unwieldy coalition intact than with the issues of governance. Some of his moves have showed his skills in political manoeuvring, but that does not serve the interests of the people in one of the poorest states of the country. Jharkhand has many fundamental problems ? economic and social ? crying out for the government?s serious attention. 

 The problem is that personal ambitions, rather than public interest, seem to have prompted Mr Sinha?s campaign. The suspicion is strengthened by the history of personal rivalries and bickerings among the BJP leaders in Jharkhand. Soon after Mr Munda took over as the chief minister last March, his predecessor, Mr Babulal Marandi, raised the first banner of revolt against him. True, Mr Munda?s style of functioning has much to do with the party squabbles. The party?s problems seem to have a demoralizing effect on the administration. To complicate matters, the central leadership of the BJP is apparently anxious only to keep the revolts under wraps. It has done the same by asking Mr Sinha not to criticize the chief minister publicly. But there is no credible proof that Mr Sinha?s complaints have been taken seriously. This is no way either to end the disaffection in the party or to improve the administration. This is a dangerous slide in a state that has to fight, apart from acute poverty, the Maoist rebellion. A directionless government will be grist to the Maoists? mill. Mr Munda must halt the slide before it becomes unmanageable.

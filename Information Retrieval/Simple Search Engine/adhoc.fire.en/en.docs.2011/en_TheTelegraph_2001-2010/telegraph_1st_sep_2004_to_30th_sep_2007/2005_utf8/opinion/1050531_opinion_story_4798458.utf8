 LESSONS FROM THE PAST

 For the early converts to Christianity, changing their religion did not mean betraying the nation, says Sipra Mukherjee

 Charmed circle 

 The conviction of Dara Singh in the Staines murder case, brings to mind a few interesting aspects of the larger debate concerning religious conversion. 

 Conversions have almost always been looked upon as invasion ? an event that brings about a shift in the established power equation. The missionaries are accused of manipulation and coercion, while the convert is accused of betrayal of his culture and tradition. Seen in conjunction with our colonial baggage, conversion to Christianity is looked upon as capitulation to the imperialists and betrayal of the nation. But it is doubtful whether such unproblematic conclusions would stand the test of even superficial investigation. The historian, Mohammed Mohar Ali, has argued that the earliest stirrings of nationalism in Bengal were not the return to Hinduism or the revival of classical texts, but the attempt by native Christians to indigenize Christianity and set up native Christian churches.

 The strong Hindu, anti-Christian, ideological bent of the nationalist narrative has overlooked the role of the convert as a form of resistance.

 The individual histories of many converts challenge any simplistic deduction. One of the earliest converts from Calcutta was Krishna Mohan Banerjea, whose birth anniversary it is this month. A rebel belonging to the Young Bengal movement, Banerjea appeared to have consummated his love and appreciation of European culture by embracing Christianity. (The notorious incident of the throwing of beef into a Brahmin?s house occurred from Banerjea?s home, though he was not present at the time.) An easy equation of his conversion with betrayal of his nation is precluded by his activities. He was involved with the Indian League, the political association of the middle classes which was hailed by The Englishman as the first sign of the awakening of eastern India to political life. Banerjea was made president of the League and he continued as president of the later Indian Association, the foundation of the future Indian National Congress.

 The allegation of abandoning one?s culture for that of a foreigner?s is another charge that is difficult to pursue against Banerjea. His love of knowledge transcended cultures and he was equally keen to bring to his students works of both the East and the West. He translated into English the Brahma-Sutra with Sankaracharya?s commentary, the Mahimnastava, a hymn to Shiva, and published Rig Veda Samhita with notes and explanations. He also edited the Raghuvamsa, Kumarsambhava, Bhaktikavya for university students, the Purana Sangraha in the original, the Markandeya Purana, and the Narada Panchatantra. He was the editor of Vidyakalpadrum, a work that ran into 13 volumes and enabled the study of Western science and literature in the vernacular.

 The careers of converts like Banerjea (and later Lal Behari Day) chart the gradual snowballing of a rebellion against Western missionary domination of the church. Banerjea?s insistence in 1847 on equal pay with European missionaries was met with indignant refusal. The Western missionaries looked upon Banerjea?s demand as ingratitude. Banerjea responded by refusing the post at St Paul?s Cathedral. This issue of equality of pay was to plague A.G. Street of Bishop?s College too who deplored the college?s earlier decision to give equal salaries. His argument was based on the opinion that the material needs of the Indians were less than that of Europeans: ?though they have chairs and tables they will sit in the native fashion, though they own knife and fork and spoon they will prefer their fingers; though they have boots and pantaloons to appear abroad in, they will sit in dhooti and shudder when quite at home.?

 Religious conversion in a colonized nation was an event that had many facets. The commonly held assumption was that the native Christians enjoyed an intimacy with Western missionaries who, being on good terms with the imperialists, smoothened their way in the world. This may, in reality, have been a distorted picture. While conversion did usher educated natives into the charmed circle, this alliance was sometimes darkened by the less egalitarian shades of the association between Europeans and Indians in the outside world. The play of power and subservience between the two groups engendered hierarchies that disrupted the concepts of equality and liberality which converts associated with Christianity.

 For example, Lal Behari Day clashed with Alexander Duff over the representation of Indians by Indians in the missionary council of the Church, the central policy-making body in which Europeans sat as matter of right. Despite strong opposition from Duff, Day stuck to his demand. A few decades later came Bhabani Charan Banerjee, an ardent nationalist who took up the name of Brahmbandhav Upadhyay, a Sanskritized version of the Latin Theophilus, and died under arrest for sedition in 1907. Narayan Viman Tilak, the converted Maharashtrian Brahmin who used Christianity to articulate his nationalist vision of India, is an accepted figure in Marathi nationalist literature.

 A re-reading of the issues that dominated the lives of these Christian converts would show that a change of religion did not consequentially signify any lessening in the feelings for the nation. Perhaps, we could then apply the lessons from this re-reading to the debate on conversion in contemporary India.

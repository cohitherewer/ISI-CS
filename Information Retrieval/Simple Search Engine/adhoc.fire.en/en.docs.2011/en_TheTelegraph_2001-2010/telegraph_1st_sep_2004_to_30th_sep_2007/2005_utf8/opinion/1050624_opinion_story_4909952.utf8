 HISTORY AND ITS CLICH?S

 KOLKATA CANVAS (Alchemy, Rs 595) is a portfolio of black-and-white photographs of the city by Sunil K. Dutt. Dutt prefaces it by a rather gushing piece of text (?I simply try to touch the feet of Kolkata and her loving citizens?), followed by a learned elegy to the city by Goutam Ghose. This is a mixed collection. There are interesting and arresting photographs, especially the couple of rather bizarre studies of Bengali family life with a mother and her two grown-up offspring engaged in horseplay. Some of the images are visual clich?s of the city, while a few others appear a trifle contrived. Victoria, Book Fair, the photogenic Ray in his photogenic study, rickshawpullers, foreigners, cows. This is a fascinatingly dated picture of students in front of Presidency College. From the graphiti and cars to the way the saris are worn, this is a bit of history.

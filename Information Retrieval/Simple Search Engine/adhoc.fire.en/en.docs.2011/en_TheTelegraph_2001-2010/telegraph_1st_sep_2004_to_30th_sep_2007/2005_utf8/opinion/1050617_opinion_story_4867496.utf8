 JUDGE A BOOK ALSO BY ITS COVER

 Why don?t the covers of up-market fiction reflect the contents of the novel? Why has plain typography been replaced by graphics? Novelists are notoriously sensitive creatures, yet not many have a choice of their covers? All the same, with some covers, especially reissues of Penguin classics that are masterpieces of picture research, can we any longer say, ?Don?t judge a book by its cover??

 A one-line answer to the first three questions is: ?Because of the market.? Market forces have compelled publishers or their design departments to make covers livelier and more intrusive, like advertisements. The notion that the book should not draw attention to itself and that the voice should be of the writer, has long since been tossed aside as antiquated and absurd. Success is what matters, and success means money.

 What makes for this success is a mix of four factors; the appeal of the cover, the price, the discounts and credits, the amount of promotion by the publisher, and a few other under-the-table privileges. But it is the cover that makes the book stand out and attracts the potential buyer. And it is the cover that provides the space in cramped bookshops.

 Given the number of books churned out now, the retailer?s problem is lack of physical space to display new books. Just stacking them up on the shelves doesn?t make them noticed; and without being seen there is one-to-ten chance of their being picked up. 

 And it is not just a question of physical space; there is competition for mental space too. The browser or the impulse buyer spends no more than five minutes to buy or move on. So the cover matters and truth isn?t allowed to come in the way of a sale.

 Two questions remain. First, to what extent is an author allowed a say in the making of a cover? Second, does the old adage, ?never judge a book by its cover? still hold? There is no simple answer to these questions.

 Take the first question. The system as it is today is something like this. The editor who has read the manuscript and the proofs briefs the artist(s) on the kind of cover that should be designed. These rough designs are then sent for approval to the author with a note to grade his preferences. He is also allowed to suggest minor alterations. But this doesn?t quite hold for the ?big? authors who sell. They like to be ?consulted?, which is an euphemism for ?you do what I tell you.? Publishers agree because they know that ?well-known-ness? of the author sells.

 The eternal verities about the cover and the content still hold. There is no visual integrity because the market has taken over and this is compounded by the hype on the blurb that accompanies it. So, it is best to check it out yourself before going in for the book. All the same, there has been a revolution in book covers that take reproductions from art galleries or stills from films to seduce you to buy the book. This seduction is well worth it!

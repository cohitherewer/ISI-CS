 Letters to Editor

 Whose interest?

 Sir ? The slash in the interest rate of the employees? provident fund by one per cent for the current financial year is a welcome and timely decision taken by the board of trustees. Surely, it is not expected that the government will continue to pay the 9.5 per cent interest from its reserve fund. This can only result in the bankruptcy of the fund. The Union labour minister, K. Chandrasekhar Rao, who in the face of strong opposition from the left parties and trade unions announced the reduction of the EPF interest rate, deserves praise. The interest rate for general provident fund, contributory provident fund and so on has continued to be 8 per cent for the past three years. The rate of interest on EPF should be further slashed to 8 per cent to make it on par with other provident funds.

 Yours faithfully,

Ashim Dasgupta, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The central board of trustees of the Employees Provident Fund Organization have recommended 8.5 per cent interest on EPF for 2005-06. But an interest rate of 8 per cent would have been more justified, since the interest includes subsidies. Subsidies are not beneficial for developing countries. Furthermore, the maximum rate of interest for cent per cent safe deposits is 8 per cent for the public provident fund and various schemes of the post office such as the National Savings Scheme, Kisan Vikas Patra, Post Office Monthly Income Scheme and for taxable bonds of the Reserve Bank of India. The only exception is the 9 per cent interest in special schemes for senior citizens, with a maximum capital deposit of Rs 15 lakh. Therefore, it would be unjustified to give more than 8 per cent on EPF. If the government fails to lower the interest rate to 8 per cent under political pressure, then all the other schemes mentioned above must get the same rate as the EPF.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Communist leaders are up in arms against the Central government and the EPF board, headed by the Union labour minister, K. Chandrasekhar Rao, for slashing the PF rate from 9.5 per cent to 8.5 per cent. The left?s opposition to the slash is part of its usual attempt to curry favour with the country?s working-classes. However, it is doubtful whether the ruling coalition can finally accomplish anything effective. It should be remembered that the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, had informed the left parties in advance that the lowering of interest rate had become inevitable. Shouldn?t the left have registered its protest then?

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? Notwithstanding the left?s demand for 9.5 per cent interest on EPF, the prime minister?s refusal to give financial support to the trust fund must have had valid reasons. It is difficult to believe that the left is unaware of them. Do the left parties really think that the national exchequer ought to divert its already scarce funds from the essential service sectors such as health and education, to fatten the pockets of the affluent? 

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The prime minister, Manmohan Singh, has agreed to look into the EPF board?s decision to reduce the rate of interest on deposits from 9.5 per cent to 8.5 per cent. As a part of the economic reforms, interest rates on deposits have fallen steeply in the last 10 years, but the same has not happened with the prices of essential commodities. Any income from bank deposits and savings such as EPF gets reduced every year to adjust to inflation. Any move to cut interest rates further before prices stabilize will harm the interests of the middle and working classes. The left?s stand on the matter needs to be appreciated. The provident fund is the only compulsory saving for Indian employees. It is the only form of social security for the working classes. The labour and finance ministries, and the prime minister should reconsider the EPF board?s decision and pass necessary orders for maintaining the rate of interest at 9.5 per cent.

 Yours faithfully,

Suman Barthakur, Guwahati

 Sir ? Reducing the interest rate on EPF to 8.5 per cent is a welcome move. For years, the interest rates on EPF have been too high for the prescribed investment pattern to sustain. The declared rates also forced trustees of private exempted funds to maintain the same rates, causing an unacceptable burden on them. Given that interest rates in the financial sector have witnessed a downward trend over the years, it is important not to subsidize and maintain the EPF rates at higher levels at the cost of the exchequer. No doubt, the left parties will cry themselves hoarse over this move and bring an enormous pressure on the government to enhance the rate. The government should stand firm on its decision and explain the changed realities to the supporters of their coalition to make them see sense.

 Yours faithfully,

C.N. Kumar, Bangalore 

 Sir ? Did Manmohan Singh have to do a complete turnaround on the EPF issue (?Singh hands off PF rate?, Dec 11)? The prime minister had always promised economic reforms with a human face. How does that square with the recent PF rate slash? This decision should be immediately reconsidered. Otherwise, that time is not far off when people will neither be able to put money in the bank because of the meagre rate of interest nor will they retire with a sizeable amount of money to serve as surety for their last years. Is this situation preferable in any way to the discomfort of the exchequer to pay a rate of interest of 9.5 per cent?

 Yours faithfully,

Kumar Shankar Roy, Calcutta

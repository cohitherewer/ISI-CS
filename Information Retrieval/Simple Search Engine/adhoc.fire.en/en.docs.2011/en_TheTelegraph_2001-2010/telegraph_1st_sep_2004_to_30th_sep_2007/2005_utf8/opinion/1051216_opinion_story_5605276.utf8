 SPEAK NO EVIL

 Reform is for the government and not for the party. This appears to be the prevalent mood and dictum within the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Communist parties, when they existed elsewhere in the globe, were invariably severe on members who voiced their criticism and grievances against the party in public. Sometimes, especially in the high noon of Stalin?s tyranny, the expression of criticism and dissent even within the party could be fatal or result in an unending trip in the gulag. The CPI(M) in West Bengal has chosen to swim with the tide of economic reforms but it is unwilling to let in criticism and dissent within its ranks. A set of guidelines issued recently by the party instructs members to refrain from criticizing the government in public. The attempt is to show that the entire party is completely and unitedly behind the policies that are being formulated by the government led by Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. These policies are all to do with getting back capital to the state of West Bengal, and are therefore in keeping with liberalization and globalization, to which communists are opposed in terms of doctrine and ideology.

 The instructions to gag criticism from comrades is a clear indication that all is not well within the party so far as the government?s policies are concerned. Unity and unanimity are being imposed from above through orders. The presence of grievances is not difficult to understand. For purposes of mobilization, in its rhetoric and in its doctrinaire formulations, the CPI(M) in West Bengal, till very recently, was anti-capital, and virulently against multinationals. This situation has now radically altered because of the intervention of Mr Bhattacharjee. It is not easy for the party apparatchik at the grassroots level to explain and to communicate this 180 degrees turn around. There are questions, doubts and confusion; and there is also the fear that these might spill over into criticism. Such a situation a few months before the assembly elections would not augur well for the party. Hence the pre-emptive move to put a lid on things. This is a characteristic Stalinist move and is thus out of tune with the ambience of transparency and openness that Mr Bhattacharjee is trying to create within the government. A government wedded to economic reforms and a party still tied to democratic centralism are pulling in contrary directions.

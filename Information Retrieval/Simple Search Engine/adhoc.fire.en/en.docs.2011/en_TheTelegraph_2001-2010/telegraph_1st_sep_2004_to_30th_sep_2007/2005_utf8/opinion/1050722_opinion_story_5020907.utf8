 RAY AMP; HIS BOSWELL

Satyajit Ray once described Nemai Ghosh as his Boswell 

with a camera. Andrew Robinson earned no such praise from Ray, who in the last 

years of his life completely distanced himself from Robinson and his writings. 

Thus the coming together of Ghosh and Robinson in this book (SATYAJIT RAY: A VISION 

OF CINEMA, I.B.Taurus, ? 45) is a trifle bizarre. Robinson?s text and captions 

have nothing new to offer and is largely a rehash of what he has previously written 

on Ray. Ghosh?s pictures are all good, some are outstanding. Ray was an easy subject 

to photograph: he was so photogenic and his face was so expressive. Ghosh captures 

the master in various moods and in various aspects of his work. But readers of 

this lavish book will have one grouse. Ghosh started to photograph Ray only from 

1968 but there are stills here that go back to Ray?s pre-1968 days. Thus the author 

line ?Photographs by Nemai Ghosh? is not correct. Ray would not have liked this 

from his Boswell.

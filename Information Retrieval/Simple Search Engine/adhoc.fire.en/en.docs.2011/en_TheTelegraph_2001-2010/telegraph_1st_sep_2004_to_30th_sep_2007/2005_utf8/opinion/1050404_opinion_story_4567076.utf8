 MOTHER DOESN?T KNOW BEST

 SHOT IN THE DARK

 Is there a case for the state to step in and shoulder the responsibility of a surrogate parent?

 ?But she is her mother, isn?t she??exclaimed a friend, her face flushed with indignation, as we sat discussing about little Gudiya?s fate. Gudiya?s mother, Shanti, had decided to send her eight-year-old daughter back to her employer?s house where the little girl had been mauled by two Alsatian dogs only a few days back, and this had outraged my friend?s genteel sensibilities. What had compelled Shanti to do this? Was it her poverty which made it impossible for her to make ends meet? Or was it the lack of education, which made it difficult for her to imagine that there could be better alternatives? 

 Parents often act in the most bizarre and violent manner towards their children. How else can one explain mothers selling their daughters to traffickers, as it happened recently in Shantipur? Or for that matter, the silence surrounding the sexual exploitation of minors within our homes? The idea of a society being perfectly secure for our children is perhaps utopian. But does that mean that it reneges on the promise of providing certain basic rights to children, some of which are enshrined in the Constitution? The Gudiya episode, significantly, shows how much has been been accomplished and what more needs to be done to make India a better place for children. 

 It?s not as if everything about this incident was depressing. The media gave it the coverage that was needed, voluntary organizations fought for the girl doggedly, and surprisingly, the police, including high-ranking officials, were seen cooperating with rare commitment. Yet, all the good work seems to have come undone on the face of that fundamental logic that a child?s best interests are served by the mother. A mother?s right over her child, even in the eyes of the law, is seemingly inviolable. It was this clause which enabled Shanti to have her own way even though it was apparent that Gudiya does not exactly stand to gain by returning to her employers. 

 There is then, a clear case for our courts to consider a situation in which a child?s ?best interests? do not lie with the mother. Does this also imply that the state can step in to plug this lacuna and shoulder the responsibility of a surrogate parent? After all, it commands substantial resources, both material and legal, to provide security to poor, vulnerable children, whose parents are incapable of looking after them.

 This alternative, however, is also fraught with dangers. For example, who is to decide at what point the parents are to be considered ?incapable?? Besides, the state has, more often than not, failed when it comes to meeting some of children?s primary needs ? food, shelter, education and physical safety. Juvenile homes have more inmates outside their gates than within. Sexual exploitation of children and incidents of child labour are on the rise. Yet, legal provisions are far less than adequate in both respects: only rape and sodomy qualify as criminal offences, while the state?s so-called commitment to abolish child labour still remains on paper. 

 Yet, the idea of a surrogate state merits serious deliberation. Simply because it should and can care when it wants to. Children, as Gudiya has shown us, are not always safe in their mothers? arms.

 Letters to Editor

 Sleep on it

 Sir ? Amit Roy, as usual, gets it all wrong about Bollywood in ?Who will cast the first couch? (March 20). He believes that sexual allegations (manufactured, he implies) against directors and stars can be made in Bollywood because instead of leaving the job of casting to professionals (preferably female), they make themselves easily available to wannabe actors. True. But this is because that is exactly how they want it to be. Acting talent is the last prerequisite to starring in any Bollywood product. Aspiring actors have to have great bodies and know how to move them (sometimes to raunchy music). And since this ?talent? is freely available, the go-getters often have to move an extra yard to get there. There is another thing. Bollywood caters to the Indian male. And women casting directors would be the last people to judge whether a hopeful can manage to titillate him.

 Yours faithfully,

M. Chatterjee, Calcutta

 Marching ahead?

 Sir ? Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi?s Dandi march on March 12, 1930, with 78 of his devoted followers, marked the beginning of the civil disobedience movement. The journey to Dandi was to signal his protest against the British government?s imposition of tax on salt, consumed by the ?poor man? of the country, and the move was to change the course of India?s destiny forever. Seventy-five years later, it is no longer the British, but the Congress which rules the country. But the tax is no longer merely on salt, but on all commodities consumed by the poor man Gandhi was trying to protect. The leaders are self-confessed Gandhians, but their luxurious lifestyle shame the people who cannot even come close to their Black Cat commando-protected representatives. The numbers of those who claim to uphold their interests, from the panchayati level to the parliament, have swelled to an unimaginable number. And it is the poor of India who pay for their upkeep, their pension and other benefits. How will a much-advertised trudge to Dandi set all that right? 

 Yours faithfully,

Sunanda Dutt, Calcutta

 Sir ? The Congress president, Sonia Gandhi, flagged off the 75th anniversary of the Dandi march in Ahmedabad amidst much fanfare. The aim was to prove that Gandhi is not a figure from the past but also the inspiration for the future. The event, attended by a large number of politicians, including top Congress leaders, generated a lot of public interest and got wide coverage. At a time when the birth and death anniversaries of Gandhi have become mere state rituals, the re-staging of the Dandi march will have gone a long way in reviving popular interest in Gandhi. Today only a few remember his sacrifices, and those of his followers, made for the country. We have also forgotten the significance of the Dandi march, like so many other important events of the freedom struggle. The Congress initiative should be appreciated. 

 Yours faithfully,

Md. Mudassir Alam, Aligarh

 Sir ? I saw a video clipping of the Dandi march in which a Mahatma Gandhi lookalike was seen walking alongside Rahul Gandhi. It was disgusting to see this man dressed in a soiled dhoti. Gandhi, no doubt, used to wear a simple dhoti to cover his body because that was all that was available to the common man at that time. But this did not mean that the great man was unclean in his ways. In fact, Gandhi believed that cleanliness is next to godliness. I don?t think today?s leaders are acquainted with this fact. The Congress gimmick has certainly shown Gandhi in a poor light. I hope the mistake will not be repeated.

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

 Sir ? For the Nehru-Gandhi bahu, who has been equated with Gandhi for her tyaga, the Dandi march was one more occasion to focus on her likeness with the Mahatma. For the Congress, it was a stone to kill two birds with. With Dandi, it would be seen taking the political battle right into the saffron heartland (Modiland, that is). By the same stroke, it would be seen as being more true to the Gandhi legacy than the Gujarati saffronwallahs. But with its jatra over the yatra, isn?t the Congress falling into the same trap as the saffronites?

 Yours faithfully,

J. Sinha, Calcutta

 Not built in a day

 Sir ? The building on 27, Jawaharlal Nehru Road, which houses the Zoological Survey of India, the Anthropological Survey of India and the Archaeological Survey of India was built in 1964 (?Sick of space jam, museum takes spat to Centre?, March 6). The purpose was to house the ZSI?s wet collections (in spirit) and the building was designed to cope with any fire hazard. The ZSI allowed the other two survey departments to house part of their establishment in the building. The Indian Museum has no real claim on that building. There are also two other Central survey offices in the same campus. The Indian Museum building also houses the public galleries of ZSI and GSI, as part of the agreement between the survey and museum authorities. The surveys bear the cost of maintaining these while the museum collects the gate money from visitors.

 Yours faithfully,

A.K. Ghosh, Calcutta

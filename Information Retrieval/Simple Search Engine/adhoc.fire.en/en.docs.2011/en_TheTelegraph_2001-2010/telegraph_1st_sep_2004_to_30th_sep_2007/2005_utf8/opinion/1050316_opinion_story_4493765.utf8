 Letters to Editor

 Price of a tall tale

 Sir ? If a young student from Ballia, Saurabh Singh, tried to fool his villagers, and in the process, fooled the entire nation, then that does not necessarily make him the villain of the piece (?Secret life of Saurabh Singh?, March 13). He is merely a pawn in a larger, sordid game. The real villain is the fourth estate, which has lost its credibility, if it ever had one. If it were so apparent that the name of the NASA chief, Sean ?O Keefe, was misspelt on Singh?s certificate, and his signature forged, how is it that it slipped the eyes of our ?investigative? journalists? Singh will have to pay the price of his folly throughout his life, but the media, which bought his story without so much as a question, is unlikely to be deterred in its mission of telling tall tales to ?put India on the world map?. If our good media keeps this up, we will soon have Indians landing on Mars. So, stay tuned.

 Yours faithfully,

Deeparnak Bhowmick, Guwahati

 Gender sensitive

 Sir ? It was heartening to note that henceforth eunuchs will not have to agonize over the male or female option in passport application forms and can simply write ?E? (?Third sex in passports?, March 9). This must be good for the Indian democracy which ought to accommodate all its citizens, including people with indeterminate genders. But what about the darker side of the eunuch story? Why must Indian families remain in terror once a child is born, waiting for the day the eunuchs will descend on them? And why should people be forced to pay under the threat of actual physical violence, terrible obscenities, and storming of households? The police rarely intervenes and even advises victims of eunuch violence to ?adjust?. Extortion by eunuchs is a regular affair in passenger trains, marriage ceremonies, and even in shops. What makes eunuchs special, when extortionists of a ?determinate? gender are readily dealt with by the law? Like some extra-judicial authority, eunuchs even issue immunity certificates to those who have paid. Why is the media, the legal and the political establishment largely silent on this form of terrorism? What act of the Indian constitution allows people?s homes to be violently invaded, even if by those with alternate gender identities? Finally, will those countries, which our ?special? citizens may choose to visit with their ?E? passports, entertain such behaviour towards their citizens?

 Yours faithfully,

Prosenjit Roy, Calcutta 

 Sir ? We welcome the goverment?s decision to introduce the third-gender category in passport forms. We believe that this first step towards identifying people of the third gender as citizens of India is the fruit of the struggles of the NGOs working with them. Much more is yet to be done. Health and social welfare officials must see to it that babies belonging to the third gender are marked ?E?, instead of being classified under male or female in the birth certificates issued by hospitals and nursing homes. This would help avoid complications in the future. 

 The Eunuch Children Welfare Association aims to educate such children. A proposed residential school for them awaits the approval of the Central and state authorities. Most parents are forced to suppress their wards? true gender identity in order to get them admitted into regular schools. If does get revealed through some accident, the children are subjected to endless humiliation by their class mates. They are forced to ?drop out?, if they are not thrown out by the school. And then begins their journey into darkness. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bibhujit Halder, secretary, Eunuch Children Welfare Association, Bandel

 Sir ? Eunuchs are seen to avail themselves of the public facilities meant for women, such as the ladies? seats on public transport. I have seen eunuchs abusing male commuters sitting on ladies? seats and forcing them to get up. Many passengers are also seen to support their demand. Will the government clarify whether they are legally entitled to claim ladies? seats on public transport? Or should they be asked, instead. to sit on the ?general? seats?

 Yours faithfully,

 Loss and gain

 Sir ? It was shocking to see India let go of the advantage in the first test against Pakistan in Mohali. But the bowlers can?t be blamed for this. The pitch was dead as a dodo. The absence of Harbhajan Singh was felt, but then his inclusion would have meant the exclusion of Balaji who took nine wickets in the match. 

 Yours faithfully,

Moinak Basu, Raniganj

 Sir ? After the drawn Mohali test, it has been proved beyond doubt that Sourav Ganguly is no Ricky Ponting, and that the Indians lack the killer instinct needed in crunch situations.

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir ? The Mohali test may have disappointed Indian fans, but for lovers of the game, enough entertainment was provided by Kamran Akmal and Sehwag.

 Yours faithfully,

K.B. Goswami, Calcutta

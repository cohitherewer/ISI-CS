 STOCK RESPONSES WON?T HELP

 Not an inch to spare

All Indian authors complain that their books are not ?available? in bookshops. This implies that publishers are not doing enough to promote and sell the books to retailers. Many titles are not readily available in bookshops, especially if they happen to be offbeat. What is the problem and who?s to blame? 

 Look at it from the publisher?s point of view. No publisher would like to see stocks lying around in the warehouse. It is common sense that he would like to liquidate the print-run as quickly as possible, recover his dues and move on to the next batch of titles. Given the meagre profit margins in a price-sensitive market, he has to rotate his stock, twice or thrice a year.

 And, in order to do this, publishers offer the maximum discount possible, generous credit terms and other facilities like returns, which means that if some copies are not sold within a stipulated period, they can be returned and a credit issued against them. From the publisher?s point of view, the bookseller is thus in a win-win situation. 

 Booksellers would disagree. First, with the increasing costs of overheads ? establishment, wages, marketing ? the discounts are never enough. Besides, with the bulk of sales going to institutions, instead of to individuals who pay over the counter, recovery of dues is painfully slow. Booksellers say they have to borrow from banks to pay on time, which cuts into their margins. 

 Booksellers also complain about the lack of publicity ? either in the media or through direct mails to customers. Books that were previously unprofitable could become profitable if only publishers resorted to greater publicity. Between the small number of popular titles that sell hundreds of copies and the long tail of less popular titles, booksellers are beginning to prefer the latter because the margins are larger. Of course, it is a toss-up between the small number of popular titles that have a quick turnover but very small margins and the large number of titles with low sales but very large margins. Booksellers want to stock both, but it does not quite work out.

 There are two reasons for this. The bookshop loses its identity in the mish-mash and the customer doesn?t know what to make of it. But the much bigger reason is that bookshops simply don?t have the space, so they generally hold those that are most likely to sell. Where?s the space for more? Inventory control, even with all the computerization at hand, makes it impossible to keep track of hundreds of titles that sell in ones and twos over a period of six months.

 What is the solution to the overproduction of new titles? Cut back on publishing programmes? Publishers won?t agree and neither will booksellers who always want something new to sell. Does the answer lie in an online store with no limits on shelf-space? Online bookshops will have not just variety but information about the variety, which is very important in this age of information overkill.

A widening of aesthetic horizons had been taking place for a while. The traditional image is being made in styles taken from the arts of different regions of India. The pandals themselves recreate buildings and histories ? all of these a transitory but unforgettable manifestation of the genius and imagination of India?s craftsmen, artisans and builders.

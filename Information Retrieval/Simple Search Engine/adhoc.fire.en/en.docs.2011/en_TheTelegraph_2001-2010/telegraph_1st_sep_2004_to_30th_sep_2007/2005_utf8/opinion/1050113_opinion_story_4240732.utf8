 Letters to Editor

 Emergency measures

 Sir ? Some people have been rightly saying that the tsunami is a compelling reason to cancel the Republic Day celebrations. The Centre and states ritually squander astronomical sums on the event every year. The irrelevance of the event has been evident for decades now. The celebrations cause inconvenience to common people, especially in a city like Delhi. Look at the tight security, often enforced in a draconian manner, which subjects visitors ? even pass holders ? to a body search. The event has in reality become yet another occasion for our politicians and bureaucrats to flaunt their importance and entertain themselves. The nation should instead divert the funds meant for the purpose to the relief and rescue work for the over-a-quarter-million Indian victims of the tsunami. Commonsense demands that India give up this annual, expensive and irrelevant ritual, at least for a year. 

 Yours faithfully,

N. Narasimhan, Bangalore

 Class lessons

 Sir ? The headmistress of Bonhooghly Girls? High School should be more concerned with the efficiency of teachers and the welfare of the school (?Only saris, no lipstick for teachers?, Jan 5). Imposing a dress code will not help her achieve that. By not allowing teachers wearing make-up to classes, is she trying to prove her administrative powers?

 Yours faithfully,

Sharmistha Nag, Calcutta

 Sir ? Every vocation has implied sartorial norms ? a bureaucrat can hardly sport a David Beckham-like hairstyle. These are obvious things and do not need reiteration. But when a bunch of Bipasha Basu-wannabes joins the ?noble? profession of teaching; and mingle with teachers of nondescript Bengali-medium schools and students from lower-middle-class families, even the obvious needs to be emphasized. Had they taught in premier CBSE/ICSE schools, no eyebrows would have been raised. But these teachers are perhaps short on merit for those schools. 

 The socio-economic reasons for this malaise are not far to seek. Till a decade ago, teachers were recruited by school managing committees from among local candidates. As a result, those selected were familiar with the locality. Now, recruitment is merit-based, giving urban candidates an advantage. Instead of boosting academic excellence, this practice has widened the urban-rural divide. Urbanites do not like to commute long distances to teach pupils with rustic accents. The pay makes it worthwhile, but they are contemptuous of the rural folk. Their behaviour alienates them further from the rural society. But the feminists, who talk about freedom of expression, will not consider all this. The result is that an awareness of fashion is spread among the girls, causing them to pressurize their parents to give them a lifestyle they can ill afford. These teachers may look like film actresses if they wish to, but only after they have quit their jobs.

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Pal, Batanagar

 Sir ? When the Shiv Sena and BJP had desired decorous dress-codes for college-going girls, other political parties had called it saffronization of Indian culture. What do they have to say about the decision of the Bonhooghly Girls? High School management? The circular, rather the fatwa, is a violation of human rights. Lipstick, bindi, bangles and kajal are adornments of Indian women. You can?t stop teachers from wearing them. Students can see women in far more objectionable attire on television, and even on the roads. The Bonhooghly Girls? High School should first impose a ban on these before disciplining school-teachers.

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur 

 Sir ? Young people look up to their teachers. It is therefore very important that teachers instil a sense of morality in their pupils. A dress code is just one aspect of it. Not that wearing lip-colour is bad, but it would not be wrong to say that it conveys the message that being fashionable is one of the virtues of life. It is definitely not so. Adults have the right to make themselves look attractive. Nevertheless, when they are in the noble profession of teaching, they must use their discretion in expressing their rights. 

 I teach first-year college in the United States of America but neither my colleagues nor I turn up in class wearing outlandish clothes, even though there are no laws that say we can?t. It is more of an unwritten code that instructors should present themselves in a manner that commands respect from students. Of course, no rule must be imposed upon teachers telling them what to do or how to conduct themselves. But a set of guidelines may be framed and then it must be left to the teachers to do what they think is best for their students.

 Yours faithfully,

Ankur Roy, Knoxville, US

 Sir ? Women teachers using cosmetics is not new. The more reputed the school, the more beauty conscious the teachers. So it will be hard for the administration of the Bonhooghly school to change its teachers. School-teachers may rebel saying that it affects their personality, or that they have the liberty safeguarded by the Constitution, to wear what they like. Thus the administration must be diplomatic and ensure that no one is disturbed.

 Yours faithfully,

Saurav Giri, Calcutta

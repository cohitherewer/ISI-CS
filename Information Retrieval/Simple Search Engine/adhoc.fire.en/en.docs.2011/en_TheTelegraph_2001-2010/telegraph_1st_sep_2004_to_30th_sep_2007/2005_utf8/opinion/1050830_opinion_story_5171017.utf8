 Extracts from the government of India?s status report on Disaster Management in India, published in August 2004

 At the district level, the District Magistrate who is the chief coordinator will be the focal point for coordinating all activities relating to prevention, mitigation and preparedness, apart from his existing responsibilities pertaining to response and relief. The District Coordination and Relief Committee is being reconstituted/re-designated into Disaster Management Committees with officers from relevant departments being added as members...the district heads of the departments engaged in development are now being included in the Committee so that mitigation and prevention are mainstreamed into the district plan. The existing system of drawing up preparedness and response plans will continue. There will, however, also be a long term mitigation plan. District Disaster Management Committees have already been constituted in 256 districts and are in the process of being constituted in the remaining districts.

 Similarly, sub-divisional and Block/taluka level Disaster Management Committees are also being constituted...Each village in multi-hazard prone district will have a Disaster Management Plan...The Disaster Management Committee which draws up the plans consists of elected representatives at the village level, local authorities, government functionaries including doctors/paramedics of primary health centres located in the village, primary school teachers etc. The plan encompasses prevention, mitigation and preparedness measures. The Disaster Management Teams at the village level will consist of members of youth organisations...and other non-governmental organisations as well as able bodied volunteers from the village. The teams are provided basic training in evacuation, search and rescue, first aid trauma counselling etc. The Disaster Management Committee will review the disaster management plan at least once in a year. It would also generate awareness among the people in the village about dos? and don?ts for specific hazards depending on the vulnerability of the village... 

 Disaster management is a multidisciplinary activity involving a number of departments/agencies spanning across all sectors of development. Where a number of departments/ agencies are involved, it is essential to have a policy in place, as it serves as a framework for action by all the relevant departments/ agencies. A national policy on disaster management has been drafted, and is in the process of consultations. In the line with the changed focus, the policy proposes to integrate disaster mitigation into development planning...The broad objective of the policy is to minimize the loss of lives and social, private and community assets because of natural or man-made disasters and contribute to sustainable development and better standards of living for all, more specifically for the poor and vulnerable section by ensuring that the developments gains are not lost through natural calamities/ disaster.

 The policy notes that State Governments are primarily responsible for disaster management...while the Government of India provides assistance where necessary...However, since response to a disaster requires coordination of resources available across all the Departments of the Government, the policy mandates that the Central Government will, in conjunction with the State Governments, seek to ensure that such a coordination mechanism is laid down through an appropriate chain of command so that mobilization of resources is facilitated.

 Letters to Editor

 Glorified streetfighter

 Sir ? Mike Tyson is one of the worst personalities of modern sports (?The good, bad and the ugly?, June 13). His misdeeds are endless ? including rape, assault and violence. He will be remembered more for these than for his prowess inside the ring. Being the practitioner of an aggressive game, he perhaps thought that aggressiveness in public life is alright too. It is surprising that he was allowed to carry on fighting and earning pots of money even after serving a prison sentence. But all good times must come to an end, and Tyson?s good times were borrowed anyway.

 Yours faithfully,

 A. Ray Chaudhuri, Asansol

 Evils around us

 Sir ? Corrupt and immoral men like Prabhu Shankar Agarwal, the owner of the Haldiram chain, have tarnished the reputation of businessmen in general. As they set examples, more and more people start believing that corrupt practices can fetch them success in business. 

 Yours faithfully,

A. Chaudhuri, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Isn?t it strange that Prabhu Shankar Agarwal offered Satyanarayan Thakur four lakh rupees to relocate his tea-stall away from his premises, and six lakh rupees to Gopal Tiwari for killing Thakur? Who knows, with a couple of lakhs more, Thakur might have been willing to clear off. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shiv Shanker Almal, Calcutta.

 Sir ? I was amazed to see that confident smile on Prabhu Shankar Agarwal?s face . Was it because of his money power and connections in high places or is he this cheerful in every situation? An ordinary citizen would find it hard to flash that kind of a smile under such humiliation. But Agarwal must remember that those who deal with murderers and extortionists like Gopal Tiwari are sure to burn their fingers sooner or later. Tiwari, a far smaller fry than Agarwal probably felt that exposing Agarwal would help him escape the gallows. 

 People like Agarwal, who have got rich in a short time (using obviously unethical means) fall easy prey to the lure of a little extra money. It is to be seen whether the bhujia baron, with his powerful connections, has the last laugh.

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The arrest of the businessman, Prabhu Shankar Agarwal, accused of masterminding the attempted murder of a tea-stall owner, has made headlines. Such activities are common, particularly in the Burrabazar area, where an unholy nexus between the local goons, politicians, police and rich businessmen is depriving the small tenants and property-owners of their rights. Only a few of these cases receive public attention. In nine cases out of ten, the poor victims give in to the pressure from the rich and the politically powerful, while the rest are either eliminated or forced to flee. 

 Recently in Burrabazar, one of my relatives, who was a tenant for the last 24 years, found himself evicted from his office. The action was taken during his absence. In spite of taking up the matter with the authorities, nothing has happened so far. And that is because people like Agarwal are smug in the knowledge that they have the law tied to their little finger.

 Yours faithfully, 

Mahesh Shah, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir ? The president has in the past mildly criticized governments for not delivering on promises. But A.P.J. Abdul Kalam has really shown that the president is not merely a titular figure by rebuking governors. Would he now do something about the politicization of this post?

 Yours faithfully,

 A.C. Banerjee, Howrah

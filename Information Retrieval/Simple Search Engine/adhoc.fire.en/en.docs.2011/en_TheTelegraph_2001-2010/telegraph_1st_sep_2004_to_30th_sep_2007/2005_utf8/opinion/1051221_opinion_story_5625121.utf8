 UNFAIR FAIR

 The bizarre attempt to hand over Deshapriya Park to a fair has been stalled. But this has not stopped the mayor of Calcutta, Mr Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya, from making the ridiculous claim that the various parks in the city are meant for fairs. By definition, fairs are commercial ventures; they are extensions of the bazaar. The latter is the selling place for many types of commodities whereas a fair concentrates on only certain specified goods. Why should such an exchange be allowed to take place in parks for which the organizers are not even paying any ground rent? This is explicitly not the purpose of parks. In a city starved of greenery, the parks, few as they are, provide relief for the citizens. It allows children a space to run around. The mayor?s claim is indefensible in economic terms and in terms of preserving the environment. He has brought his feet uncomfortably close to his mouth.

 In fact, there is a case to be made for prohibiting fairs of all kinds in the city?s parks. Fairs have already been stopped on the Maidan, which is the biggest patch of green that Calcutta has. But already, there are signs that this prohibition will be honoured only in the breach. Two fairs are slated to be held in the Maidan during this winter. One is the fair organized by the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and the other is the Book Fair. They are being allowed because the permanent fair ground on the EM Bypass is not ready. This is a reason extraordinary because of its illogicality. If the fair ground is not ready, then fairs should not be held. The matter is as simple as that. Calcutta does not possess the necessary facilities to host fairs. It does not follow that therefore the Maidan should be allowed to be destroyed. There is nothing sacrosanct about fairs, even the book fair. Fairs will have to wait till the fair ground is ready. The city?s green is more important than fairs, which are nothing better than occasions to trade on subsidized terms.

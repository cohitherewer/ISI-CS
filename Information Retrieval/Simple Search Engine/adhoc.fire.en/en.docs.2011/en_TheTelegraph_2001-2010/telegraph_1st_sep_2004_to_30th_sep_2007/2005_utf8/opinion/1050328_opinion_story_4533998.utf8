 Letters to Editor

 Small is efficient

 Sir ? The failure to conduct elections to the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council is a huge discredit to the West Bengal government. This apart, the appointment of Subash Ghisingh as its caretaker administrator, in place of a board of representatives of all parties, speaks of its submission to him. It may not be too long before Ghising successfully carves out a new state. Come to think of it, there may not be anything wrong in that. Small states lead to greater development and lower the burden on the revenue administration. The newly created states of Chhattishgarh, Jharkhand and Uttaranchal have had far more progress in this short time than when they were attached to their parent states. In fact, the government should consider the feasibility of a separate state. And it should not delay a decision in the matter, thereby giving a fillip to terrorism. North Bengal has already had a fair dose of it. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.K. Das, Calcutta

 On guard

 Sir ? When a man like A.P.J. Abdul Kalam occupies the highest office in the country, one feels that he should have more constitutional liberty to guide the country towards a better future. The ?missile-man? has, time and again, proved that developing a nation is not about operating high-tech gadgets or inventing path-breaking technologies. The job needs discipline, honesty and devotion. As his other unprecedented steps, Kalam?s speech condemning politicians has somewhat shaken the so-called representatives of the people (?Kalam bares bitter truth?, March 22). And nothing could have been more welcome at this point given the regular disruption of parliamentary proceedings. Kalam has done well to break the code of silence that prevents the president from speaking up. With him around, India should no longer miss a father figure.

 Yours faithfully,

Sayantan Das, Hooghly

 Sir ? The president has done it again. As the constitutional head of the nation, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam has done well to reprimand the legislators. A man of impeccable character and great integrity, no one is better suited to do so than he. Kalam?s speech reveals his anguish and concern over the declining standards of the nation?s politics. In several of his speeches before, he has spoken about nobility in politics, and has said that though freedom is the essence of democracy, it does not mean a licence for irresponsible behaviour.

 It is clear that the recent political developments in Goa, Jharkhand and Bihar have weighed heavily on Kalam?s mind. As the president of India, Kalam represents the aspirations of the common people of the nation. That is probably why he acted out of his brief in the Jharkhand imbroglio. Kalam has always had a concrete plan for India?s development, voiced through his many books. Envisioning an Empowered Nation: Technology for Societal Transformation is one of them. For achieving this goal, our politicians have to rise above petty politics, reach a minimum common ground by keeping aside any conflicts of ideology and work together. Unless that happens, India?s dream run will end together with Kalam?s tenure. 

 Yours faithfully,

Srinivasan Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? The president should realize that it is useless to advise India?s politicians, who have become the fomenters of all possible evils in the democratic form of governance. Fortunately, India has at present two icons of honesty occupying the posts of president and prime minister. This is the ideal time to implement far-reaching poll-reforms and other norms so that corrupt and selfish persons find it hard to survive in politics. 

 It has become customary to decorate veteran parliamentarians with ?best parliamentarian? awards, even though some of them might have been mired in controversy over charges like corruption. The idea is to encourage young and talented parliamentarians with this award. The selection committee for them should give its job more thought. 

 Yours faithfully,

Subhash C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir ? Kalam was deeply troubled when he took the unusual step of telling members of parliament that when politics degrades itself to political adventurism, the nation embarks on the calamitous road to inevitable disaster and ruination. The president actually stopped short of speaking out against the criminal and corrupt who have found a place in the house. All right-thinking people should realize that politics is too serious a business to be left to politicians alone. We must realize that blatant violation of the law by politicians not only take place but have been institutionalized. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kangayam R. Rangaswamy, Madison, US

 Sir ? In the most dignified manner possible, the president has voiced a concern that the people of this country have felt, time and again. Whatever be the outcome of his candid speech, it is time for introspection.

 Yours faithfully,

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

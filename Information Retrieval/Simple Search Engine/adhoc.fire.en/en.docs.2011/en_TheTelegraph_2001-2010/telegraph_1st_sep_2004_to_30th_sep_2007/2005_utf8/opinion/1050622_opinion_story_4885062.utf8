 GIVING A RAW DEAL

 Gwynne Dyer

 ?We are very sorry and apologise to viewers and other people who felt offended,? announced the Japanese cosmetics firm Mandom early this month, but mass ritual suicide would have been a more appropriate form of apology. The company had aired a TV commercial that showed several black people wiping the sweat from their brows with a Mandom facial wipe while a chimpanzee wearing an afro wig imitated them.

 Meanwhile, Augsburg city zoo in southern Germany has just finished a special event in which an ?African village? was erected between the baboon cage and the zebra cage. Black people living in Germany were persuaded to populate the village wearing ?tribal? regalia and playing drums, cooking food for sale or selling curios. The good citizens of Augsburg were astonished when people from elsewhere took exception to this display.

 Germans and Japanese are less sensitive about race in general and about Africa in particular than people in France or the US, where a significant minority of the population is of African descent, but patronizing attitudes about Africa are chronic in all the rich countries. Take, for instance, the current debate about increasing aid to African countries and cancelling their debts.

 Little help

 The leaders of the eight biggest developed countries will probably make a deal at the G8 summit in Gleneagles, Scotland, that doubles aid to Africa and slashes the debts of its poorest countries. Prime minister Tony Blair is determined to make Africa a priority, and Bob Geldof is seeking to repeat his success with the Live-Aid concerts 20 years by staging Live 8 concerts. But what good will they actually do for Africa?

 This is where the debate begins, and most people on both sides seem to see Africans as wayward children. Africans are just as intelligent and resourceful as other people, and if their countries are still poor, it is because they face special and very intractable problems, but the rich countries take no account of this.

 Africa?s problem isn?t dishonesty or immaturity, which are fairly evenly spread around the planet. It is too many small ethnic groups trying to share the same country. Social traditions that expect successful people to support distant relations often make the situation worse, but no other continent has such extravagant ethnic diversity, so it?s up to Africans themselves to overcome the problem. The G8 can help, but only in limited ways.

 Strings attached

 Much of Africa?s debt burden was not really aid in the first place, but money that the West (and the old Soviet Union) handed over to keep their African clients loyal during the Cold War. A lot more was ?tied? aid that funded mega-projects to create work for Western companies. So cancel the debt with no nonsense about the beneficiaries proving that they can behave ?responsibly.? And if you do give aid, give it without crippling ?conditionalities.?

 Consider Uganda?s experience, for example. Uganda was forced to impose ?user fees? on basic healthcare and primary education in the late Eighties to qualify for World Bank debt relief and aid ? so school attendance collapsed and the death rate among the rural poor soared. Eventually, president Yoweri Museveni rebelled and restored free primary education and school enrolment more than doubled. In 2001 he restored free basic healthcare, and the number of hospital outpatients almost doubled.

 There will be an orgy of self-congratulation at the G8 as African debt is cut and aid is raised, and many well-meaning people who have pressured their leaders on this issue will feel that something has been accomplished. It can be, but only if they insist on knowing what strings are attached to the help.

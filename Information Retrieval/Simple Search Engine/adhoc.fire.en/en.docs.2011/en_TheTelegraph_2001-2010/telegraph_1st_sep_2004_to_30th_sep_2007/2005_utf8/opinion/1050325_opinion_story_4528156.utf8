 Not much of the screen presence 

 Hard choice

Five years ago, in March 2000, Stephen King posted a novella, Riding the Bullet, on the internet before it appeared in print. It was an experiment with a short book ? just 66 pages in the standard novel format. Within 24 hours, an estimated 400,000 people had downloaded it (first print-runs of King?s novels are never less than a million copies), along with the software needed to read it.

 Given that encyclopaedias in book form have been wiped out and some textbooks too have an electronic edition, the question being asked is whether e-books have a future. Will they prove the old prognosis that the book is dead? Five years is a long enough time to make an assessment. The facts that have emerged so far indicate that there aren?t going to be many takers for e-books, at least in the post-30s generation. There are three reasons why the King experiment didn?t and won?t take off in the near future.

 First, though nearly a half-million people downloaded it ? it was posted free, so there was nothing to discourage the surfers? natural curiosity ? not many read it. Perhaps, those who downloaded the material did it simply because it was there for the asking or, perhaps, horror wasn?t their thing. 

 Second, distributing books on the internet is more complicated than it seems. The backlists of most publishing houses are not computerized. And even for the current list, most houses use a combination of packaged and in-house software which means that there are different kinds of formats in use for storing books electronically. It follows that the publishing industry needs to agree on formats for electronic storage and delivery. Such things take time. And, once formats are agreed upon the industry will need to computerize, store and download its lists ? and that costs money. How much is difficult to say, but you can be sure only the biggest publishers will be able to afford it.

 Third, the biggest problem is that people do not much like reading on screens. They would like to hold the book in their hands, flip through the pages, go back and forth ? just to get the ?feel? of the book. It isn?t possible to get this feeling on the screen.

 And there remains a chicken-and-egg problem: people will not buy the electronic stuff required for easy reading ? the consumer-electronics industry has started to produce devices ? until lots of books are available for downloading. Quite apart from the technical problems and consumer-resistance, there is the problem of piracy that is putting publishers off. For instance, King?s book was pirated instantly, even though downloading was free ? just to show that it could be done.

 Nevertheless, books are beginning to go online, even though, for now, it is marginal stuff like old classics that are out of copyright. The real test will come some years down the line, when the consumer will have to pay. Whether it would be better to pay and read on the screen, rather than get the ?hard copy? will depend on the new generation of readers. The present lot doesn?t intend to change its ways.

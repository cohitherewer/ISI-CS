 TROUBLE AHEAD

 The morning may not always show the day. But the beginning of Mr Arjun Munda?s second term as Jharkhand?s chief minister almost certainly signals a troubled road ahead. What he now heads is more a motley group than a well-defined political coalition. The fact that he took so long to expand the cabinet was enough indication of the pressures and bargaining that Mr Munda had to tackle on the way. It may not have been entirely the chief minister?s fault. The fractured mandate and the compulsions of striking up a majority in the state assembly left him little choice but to offer ministerial berths to all the independents who made his government possible. Mr Munda may have appeased the independents, at least for the time being. But the cabinet expansion has now left a trail of dissent within the National Democratic Alliance itself. Several leading lights of the state units of both the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Janata Dal (United) are unhappy with being left out of the cabinet. It would be wrong, therefore, to assume that the cabinet expansion brings the curtain down on the uncertainties that the hung verdict sparked. 

 All this cannot but be bad news for the people. For the lack of governance could be disastrous for a state facing the twin dangers of extreme poverty and Maoist anarchy. Having run the state?s administration over the past three years, Mr Munda should know that he needed a more stable and efficient government to tackle these two challenges. Also, the domicile policy that his previous government sought to introduce in order to identify the original settlers in the state caused deep divisions between the tribal and the non-tribal sections of the people. The new government has to think of measures to heal the wound before it starts festering. A government burdened with internal dissension and anxieties over its survival may hesitate to take steps necessary to ensure ethnic harmony. The sops that Mr Munda offered on the eve of the polls ? bicycles to poor school students, for example ? may not work any more. In any case, these cannot be substitutes for worthwhile policies. He may need all his political skills to keep his flock together, but he cannot afford to ignore the administrative tasks. A non-performing government might push more of the poor people over to the anarchists. After all, what a government does is more important than how long it survives.

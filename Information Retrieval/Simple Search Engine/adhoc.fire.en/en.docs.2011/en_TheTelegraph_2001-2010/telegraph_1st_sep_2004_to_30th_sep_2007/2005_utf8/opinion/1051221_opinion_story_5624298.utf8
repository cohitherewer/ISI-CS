 Letters to Editor

 Exit politics

 Sir ? It is hard to understand the rationale behind the axing of Sourav Ganguly. Poor form cannot be the reason, because he has scored first-class centuries this year and, though he did not quite set the pitch ablaze at Delhi, he looked in complete control of the situation in both innings. Rahul Dravid himself acknowledged that. If the idea is to build a team for the future, then shouldn?t it apply to the other seniors as well? If one takes away the three innings of 241 not out at Sydney (January 2004), 194 not out at Multan (April 2004) and 248 not out at Dhaka (December 2004), Sachin Tendulkar?s scores in tests in the last two years will make for interesting reading. His recent performance in one-day internationals too must surely be a cause for concern to the selectors if they are trying to look ahead. The selection committee certainly owes an explanation to all cricket lovers in the country.

 Yours faithfully,

Sandip Dhole, Houston, US

 Sir ? The dropping of Sourav Ganguly from the test team is a right done in a wrong manner. He should have been dropped a long time ago when he was not performing as a batsman in both forms of the game. He continued, thanks mainly to Jagmohan Dalmiya. He has ended the career of many talented ?performing? players, such as Robin Singh, Sadagopan Ramesh (the best average among openers in recent times, apart from Virender Sehwag), Vinod Kambli and others. And he promoted mediocre players like Deep Dasgupta and Devang Gandhi just because they were from Bengal. The selectors have made the right choice in Wasim Jaffer since he will now put Gautam Gambhir on his toes. When Ganguly was included in place of Zaheer Khan for the Chennai test, the Bengal press did not ask why a batsman was chosen for a bowler. So why ask now when an opener has been included in place of a middle-order batsman (or is he a bowler?) It is time the Bengal press shed its parochial attitude.

 Yours faithfully,

Ravi Iyer, Mumbai

 Sir ? When the brouhaha over Sourav Ganguly?s exclusion is over and one looks dispassionately at the events of the last few months, two things will be clear. One is that Ganguly did not deserve to go out in this fashion. The other is that to a large extent he has himself to blame for this. Right from the last series in Sri Lanka, it was becoming clear that many considered Ganguly less than a viable proposition for the 2007 World Cup. In the one-day side at least, he was becoming a liability with his slowness on-field and between wickets. He had a chance to retire with grace when he was appointed captain for the series in Zimbabwe. Had he announced his retirement then, the nasty encounter with Chappell would have been out of the question. Unfortunately he did not read the writing on the wall. Things have now spiralled so much beyond control that all the king?s horses and all the king?s men cannot put Ganguly together again.

 Yours faithfully,

N.G. Haksi, Ranchi

 Sir ? The controversy over Sourav Ganguly?s exclusion from the test team is getting into the realm of the incredulous, with politicians making logically indefensible statements and Bengalis burning effigies of Kiran More and Greg Chappell and calling for bandhs (?Gratuitous interference?, Dec 18). It is clear, however, that it will set a highly damaging precedent if a professionally determined assessment has to be altered under public pressure. The way to accommodate the popular sentiment is to get Ganguly into the act. Whatever may be his cricketing form and future prospects, he is a dedicated cricketer, still with much stake in the game. He will no doubt want to protect the sanctity of institutionalized (even if occasionally faulty) decision-making. He should be brought on board in the planning for 2007. It would be a mistake to keep him out of it, and worse, to drop him from the team without a word to acknowledge his contribution to the game. At the same time, the selection apparatus should be re-appraised to ensure that strictly cricketing considerations prevail and human biases have no play in it. An appellate procedure should also be put in place.

 Yours faithfully,

Bishan Sahai, Calcutta

 Sir ? Agreed, the dropping of Sourav Ganguly is unjustified. But is there any justification of calling a bandh in protest? It will not affect the selectors? decision, and only cause inconvenience to the people of West Bengal. It is best to remember that cricket is a game of glorious uncertainties.

 Yours faithfully,

Samin Roy, Calcutta

 Sir ? How can we allow Indian cricket to be ruled by a white man? It is surprising that Greg Chappell has not been brought to task yet, even though he has driven a wedge within the Indian team, so much so that the current captain has publicly said that he is uncomfortable sharing the dressing room with the former captain.

 Yours faithfully,

Biswadeep Sinha, Calcutta

 Sir ? Why such a hue and cry about the expulsion of Sourav Ganguly now? Wasn?t it clear when the announcement of including him was cunningly timed to come just before the Calcutta one-dayer? After all, Sharad Pawar and company couldn?t risk a loss of revenue from the Eden match. So, it was pure commercial interest that forced them to include Ganguly in the team. His exclusion was thus merely deferred. If we can show the new dispensation of the BCCI, by boycotting en mass all forthcoming matches at the Eden Gardens, maybe it will understand what Bengal means to India. 

 Yours faithfully,

Amit Banerjee, Rajahmundry

 GIVE PEACE A FEW MORE CHANCES

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the Human Development Report 2005

 Set a schedule for achieving the aid to gross national income ratio of 0.7 per cent by 2015: Donors should set budget commitments at a minimum level of 0.5 per cent for 2010. 

 Tackle unsustainable debt: The G-8 summit in 2005 produced a major breakthrough on debt owed by the heavily indebted poor countries. However, some problems remain, with a large number of low-income countries still facing acute problems in meeting debt service obligations. Final closure of the debt crisis will require action to extend country coverage and to ensure that debt repayments are held to levels consistent with millennium development goals? financing.

 Provide predictable, multi-year financing through government programmes: Donors should set more ambitious targets for providing stable aid flows, working through national systems and building capacity. By 2010 at least 90 per cent of aid should be disbursed according to agreed schedules through annual or multi-year frameworks.

 Aid conditionality should focus on fiduciary responsibility and the transparency of reporting through national systems, with less emphasis on wide-ranging macroeconomic targets and a stronger commitment to building institutions and national capacity.

 End tied aid: There is a simple method for tackling the waste of money associated with tied aid: stop it in 2006. 

 Violent conflict as a barrier to progress: In 1945 US secretary of state, Edward R. Stettinius, identified the two fundamental components of human security and their connections: ?The battle of peace has to be fought on two fronts. The first front is the security front. The second is the economic and social front. Only victory on both fronts can assure the world of an enduring peace.? It was this reasoning that led the United States of America to play a central role in founding the United Nations.

 Sixty years later, security concerns again dominate the international agenda. As the UN secretary-general?s report In Larger Freedom argues, we live in an age when the lethal interaction of poverty and violent conflict poses grave threats not just to the immediate victims but also to the collective security of the international community.

 For many people in rich countries the concept of global insecurity is linked to threats posed by terrorism and organized crime. Yet the absence of freedom from fear is most marked in developing countries. The interaction between poverty and violent conflict in many developing countries is destroying lives on an enormous scale ? and hampering progress towards the MDGs. Failure to build human security by ending this interaction will have global consequences. Development in poor countries is the front line in the battle for global peace and collective security. 

 The problem with the current battle plan is an overdeveloped military strategy and an underdeveloped strategy for human security.

 TO BE CONCLUDED

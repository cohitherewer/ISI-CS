 RIDING ON OIL 

 The story of oil price hikes in India is as tedious as a tale told many times over. Political parties refuse to accept the simple premise that changes in the domestic prices of petrol and diesel should reflect global oil prices. The price hike that was announced on Monday, after some dithering, is a response to global market prices. But the extent of the hike is still not enough. The petroleum minister, Mr Mani Shankar Aiyar, admitted that only half the rise in global prices had been passed on to the consumers. Public sector oil companies will bear the other half of the increased burden. In other words, diesel and petrol continue to be subsidized by the government. Yet as long ago as 1997, a decision was taken that over a five-year period, administered pricing of petroleum products would come to an end. It is not clear what has happened to that decision. The government continues to be involved in the pricing of petrol, diesel and LPG. There is no clear direction that oil prices will be left to global market forces. This indicates the tardy nature of liberalization in India.

 The hesitation to allow oil prices to be determined by global market forces is rooted in the failure of Indian political parties to abandon notions of socialism and populism. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Bharatiya Janata Party are most vocal in the protest against the price rise, but the Congress too is not very comfortable with the decision. The protests are utterly misplaced. The real poor of India, whose cause all politi- cal parties, especially the CPI(M), claim to uphold, are not the consumers of diesel and petrol. Neither will the real poor, since they live at subsistence level, be affected by whatever inflationary impact the price rise might have. The consumers of diesel and petrol are the city-dwellers and the rural rich who can have no claims to government subsidy by any economic or political reasoning. The left should ponder what can be done with the money that is now being used to subsidize diesel and petrol prices. That money can be put to far better use to provide food, shelter, education and health facilities for the poor of India. It is a measure of the left?s lopsided priorities that they continue to rant against a price hike, the victims of which are not the poor. Rise in oil prices is inevitable in a globalized world. The left should accept this and be less myopic about Indian realities.

 FOUL

 IS

 FAIR

 Jharkhand governor Syed Sibtey Razi seems to genuinely like people. This time, though, he kind of overdid it for the Congress

 If people who know him are to be believed, Syed Sibtey Razi is not the villain he appears to be. In his political career spanning three-and-a-half decades, Razi always managed to keep away from controversy, till this week that is. Some achievement that, given that he began his career with the Youth Congress in Uttar Pradesh and was a member of a government-sponsored board during the ?Emergency?.

 This Sanjay Gandhi acolyte has always been known for his humility, courtesy and oratorial skills in both Urdu and English. Throughout his many avatars as a minister in Uttar Pradesh, a Rajya Sabha member and Union minister of state for home in the early Nineties, the law graduate from Lucknow University kept a low profile and discretion was his watchword. Now in his mid-60s, his seemingly rash decision, therefore, to invite Shibu Soren to form the government in Jharkhand seems quite out of character.

 People in his village, Jais, can?t believe he would ever do anything to harm anyone. They see him as cultured, simple and honest, a successful politician who still visits the village regularly. They praise him as a self-made man who got into full-time politics only after his wife got a permanent job as a primary school teacher.

 The loyal Congressman from Rae Bareli, the pocket borough of the Nehru-Gandhi family, was rewarded with the Raj Bhavan in Ranchi in December last year and quickly created a favourable impression. A Congressman who called him up to congratulate him recalls his surprise when Razi recognised his voice instantly, even though they were speaking after seven years.

 The new governor threw open the Raj Bhavan to commoners, made himself accessible to ordinary people and liberally accepted invitations to attend public functions. His predecessor Ved Marwah, Raj Bhavan staff say, maintained a stiff upper lip and looked through people on his morning walk. Razi?s eyes, in contrast, light up and his face breaks into a smile when he comes across his staff during his walk.

 He seems to genuinely like meeting people, say officials in Ranchi whose respect and loyalty Razi appears to have earned already. So outraged is one of them that he blames Union minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi for the fiasco. It was Das Munshi, he insists, who would speak to Ahmed Patel every 10 minutes and dictate the script. But when things spun out of control, he fumes, they just dropped Razi.

 Certainly, something happened in the last few days for this unfailingly polite and moderate man to have lost his cool. The governor, discovered NDA legislators, can be curt and reduce people to speechlessness with his acid tongue. When an NDA delegation called on him this week with five independent legislators, Razi was quoted as saying sarcastically, ?There is no sign of the dulha but the baraat is already here!? The legislators tried to introduce the independent members but the governor would have none of it. He had merely asked for the name of the leader and a list of supporters, he curtly told the delegation, and there was no need for him to meet so many people at one go. He left them in a huff, leaving nonplussed bearers of the Raj Bhavan stranded with plates of sandwiches and snacks.

 The Bharatiya Janata Party in Jharkhand, which has vowed to ensure he does not return to the state or, if he does, he does not stay for too long, is not alone in seeing this rudeness on the part of a ?gentleman? as a result of unbearable pressure from his bosses in Delhi. Everybody knows how welcome earthworms are in the Congress, quipped a BJP leader and, true to type, Razi has jelly in his spine, he added maliciously.

 That Razi was too loyal is no longer in doubt. On Tuesday he declared he would make up his mind after meeting each of the independent legislators the next day. But the same evening his mind was made up. Soren and his ministers-in-waiting went home but could not keep the secret. They sang to friends and relatives, merrily inviting them to attend the swearing-in the next day. They also confided the good news to the media. Coming as it did hours before Razi was supposed to meet the independent legislators and formally invite anyone to form the government, Razi?s conduct was bound to raise eyebrows.

 There are people who worship the Lord; and there are those like Razi who worship people and objects around the Lord, is the tongue-in-cheek explanation of a UP Congress leader. The man has never won an election, he points out, but has survived on the patronage extended by the Nehru-Gandhi family and their supporters. Close to N.D. Tiwari, Mohsina Kidwai and Ahmed Patel, it is most likely that he was prodded by the likes of Priya Ranjan Das Munshi and R.K. Anand to act in haste. These leaders are on familiar terms with Razi and the troubleshooters of Sonia Gandhi flaunted their familiarity with the governor by calling him up on their cellphone, even in the presence of reporters, and ordering him about. His failure to stand up to bullying or his misplaced devotion and loyalty to a party, and not the Constitution, has unfortunately blotted his book forever. Even for a Razi, there is a limit to living up to one?s name.

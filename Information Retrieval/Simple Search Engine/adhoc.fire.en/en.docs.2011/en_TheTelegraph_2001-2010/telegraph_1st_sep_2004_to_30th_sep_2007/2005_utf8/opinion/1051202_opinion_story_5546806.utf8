 IN EVERYDAY LIFE

 It is necessary to die to bring anything to the authorities? notice. The open manhole in the Maidan had become part of the scenery, a constant reminder of the dangers of trying to live a normal life in Calcutta. Although everyone who frequented the area knew about it, and occasionally warned one another, it was possible for a regular tea vendor to fall into it when he was absorbed in his work. He was rescued, with injuries, but the man who drowned and died a couple of days ago did not have such good fortune. The police have been very diligent; they have immediately stuffed the mouth of the manhole with twigs. Evidently, the citizens of Calcutta deserve no better. Perhaps in no other city in the world would such a death have been possible. It is not the only open manhole in the area, there are more. They are all treated with the same tolerance by the administration that Calcutta is famous for. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the police feel no embarrassment in virtually admitting that they cannot win against manhole-cover thieves. They are ready with their horrifying statistics, not with solutions or preventive technology.

 Calcutta excels in the most incredibly shocking deaths and injuries on the roads. The widening of the roads has narrowed pedestrian space, and where there is any, it is taken up by everything else but people walking. Maybe everyone is expected to use cars, although it is not yet clear how the city is to accommodate them. Traffic is a mad mass of racing vehicles, interspersed with hand-drawn rickshaws and carts. Pavements are never mended once they have been dug up, and manholes are opened up without warning during water-logging. It would be intriguing to find out what the civic authorities consider their priority. In a city at least pretending to be civilized, it would be normal to expect the authorities to make life on the roads as safe as possible. It seems that the mark of civilization and responsibility is to pretend that the nightmare does not exist.

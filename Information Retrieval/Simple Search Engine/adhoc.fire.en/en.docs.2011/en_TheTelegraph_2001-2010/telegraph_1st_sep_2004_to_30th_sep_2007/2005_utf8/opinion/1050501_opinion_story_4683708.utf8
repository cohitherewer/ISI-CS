 THE EAST AS A CAREER 

 - Two questions that Indian writers in English are always 

 asked

 Edward Said: Custodian 

 and vigilante 

 LEGACIES OF ORIENTALISM 

 At readings by Indian writers 

 in English, two related questions, or some version of them, 

 will invariably be asked by a member of the audience, whatever 

 the setting ? bookshop, university seminar or literary festival. 

 The first question is, ?Which audience do you write for??; 

 and the second, ?Are you exoticizing India for a Western 

 audience?? I don?t know why people don?t tire of asking 

 these questions; but I notice that all kinds are interested 

 in asking them ? among others, the type whose reading consists 

 almost entirely of recent fiction, an odd mixture of The 

 Da Vinci Code, Pico Iyer, and Vikram Seth; people who 

 read almost nothing but magazines, and whose views on, and 

 affective response to, writers derive not so much from books, 

 but almost entirely from what?s circulating about those 

 books and their authors in print; and people in academic 

 disciplines like cultural studies or literature, to whom, 

 especially since the rise of the former, and the latter?s 

 surrender to the former?s protocols, such questions are 

 bread and butter.

 The questions seem to arise from 

 a misplaced idea of a moral custodianship of literature, 

 at a time when no one ? neither the reader, nor the person 

 who attends readings because of the free drinks, nor the 

 academic ? seems to have a clear or reliable notion of what 

 ?literature? is. What is it we?re trying to protect when 

 we ask these questions? What is literature, or, for that 

 matter, ?Indian writing in English?, entities largely created 

 by writers, and apparently so susceptible to being sold 

 and peddled like wares by them?

 ?Literature?, as a category, has, 

 for some time now, lost its integrity and recognizability; 

 and there is no persuasive and intelligent debate, let alone 

 a consensus, on the nature of Indian writing in English. 

 Ever since the politics of representation, rather than the 

 definition of literary practice, became a principal preoccupation 

 of literary departments, we?ve been left with one or two 

 tired moral gestures in lieu of a robust and ongoing discussion 

 of, and enquiry into, what it is we?re making those gestures 

 on behalf of. And the politics of representation ? for questions 

 about a writer?s audience, and his or her use of the ?exotic?, 

 are primarily political questions ? has passed into the 

 common parlance, in the way that more complex ideas from, 

 say, Rousseau or Freud or Marx have in the past been translated 

 into the public sphere, where they?re free to be used by 

 people who don?t know what their sources are, and sometimes 

 as a knee-jerk response to the problematic.

 As to the questions above, I think 

 it?s safe to say that the people who ask them ? whether 

 they?re nameless literary buffs, or pillars of society, 

 or teachers or students of literature ? think the questions 

 arose within themselves spontaneously as an immediate response 

 to a situation or context; there?s an assumption that these 

 questions have no history or source. But surely these questions 

 tell us more about the intellectual formations and compulsions 

 of our time, and about this moment in Indian literary history, 

 than their supposed answers would illuminate us about the 

 impulses that go into the act of writing? The questioner, 

 anyway, is hardly as interested in those impulses ? that 

 is, in the answers to the questions ? as in stating certain 

 moral parameters for writing and thinking. Where did those 

 particular parameters come from? The questions aren?t timeless, 

 but the questioner invests them with the authority of timelessness. 

 And yet, to my knowledge, no one asked Bibhutibhushan Banerjee 

 or Manik Bandyopadhyay whom they wrote for, or if they were 

 ?exocitizing? rural Bengal for a metropolitan readership.

 English, then, is part of the 

 problem; the act of writing in English was, in India, potentially 

 an act of bad faith, and a residue of the old suspicion 

 regarding the motives of those who write in English remains 

 and is still at work among us. But the focus in those earlier 

 attacks on Indian writers in English, such as the famous 

 one led by Buddhadev Bose, was artistic practice, even if 

 that practice entered the discussion negatively, with a 

 metaphysical fatalism; it was apparently impossible for 

 writers to fully and deeply address their subject except 

 in a language that was their ?own?. By bringing the audience 

 into the picture, the emphasis and the debate shift from 

 writerly practice to cultural, social, and economic transactions 

 ? from the mystery and riddle of the creative act to the 

 dissemination of texts and meanings, by publishers and newspapers, 

 in the academy and in bookshops, from meaning to the production 

 of meaning.

 This is where Edward Said comes 

 in; Said who, in a devastatingly effective substitution, 

 replaced ?meaning?, in the post-structuralist enquiry (still 

 fresh at the time) into its production, with ?the Orient?. 

 The notion is brought in, almost casually, as an interjection, 

 when Said says that his concern in his study, Orientalism, 

 is to examine the ?enormously systematic discipline by which 

 European culture was able to manage ? and even produce ? 

 the Orient?. That ?and even? shouldn?t distract us from 

 the fundamental importance Said and others after him have 

 attached to this notion. In the last few decades, there?s 

 been a palpable but often unspoken feeling that the production 

 of the Orient has moved beyond Europe, and Europeans, into 

 the realm of the diaspora, and of Indian writing in English. 

 And the spread of globalization and the free market coinciding 

 roughly with the advent of the post-Rushdie Indian novel 

 in English returns us to the epigraph from Disraeli in Said?s 

 book: ?The East is a career.? For the production of the 

 Orient involves, implicitly, its consumption; the circle 

 is incomplete without the ?audience?.

 But the concern with this form 

 of ?production? has given us not so much a critical eye 

 or sensibility, but a sense of vigilance, and, at a cruder 

 level, a kind of vigilantism; this is where the astringency 

 and aggression of those questions come from. More than a 

 year after Said?s death, we can reflect on the legacies 

 of Orientalism ? the book, not the phenomenon described 

 within it ? and say that this particular brand of vigilantism 

 too is one of them, just as much that is both and good and 

 indifferent in post-colonial studies today is. It?s the 

 Saidian inheritance that gives those questions their urgency; 

 but since they seem to have no provenance, and little critical 

 content, I?d say they are vulgarized legacies of Orientalism, 

 among the many by-products of that great polemic that are 

 both ubiquitous and don?t bear close scrutiny. This doesn?t 

 prevent those questions from being reiterated, as a constant, 

 irrefutable challenge, and their standpoint from remaining 

 unexamined; vulgarizations permeate language, and become 

 a habit of thinking. But we might begin to look beyond, 

 or behind, those questions.

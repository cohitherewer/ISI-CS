 Paperback Pickings

 Classics, cash and melancholy

Guru Dutt: A life in cinema (Oxford, Rs 

450) by Nasreen Munni Kabir is an informative analysis of melancholy 

and melodrama in the popular Hindi cinema of the Fifties and early Sixties as 

embodied in Dutt?s complex life and work. Kabir studies the films individually 

and also puts together interviews with Dutt?s family, friends and colleagues. 

Technicians, music directors and actors are also consulted. Dutt?s article, ?Classics 

and Cash?, is appended at the end, where he writes, ?In the formula-ridden film 

world of ours, one who ventures to go out of the beaten track is condemned to 

the definition which Mathew [sic] Arnold used for Shelly [sic] ?an 

angel beating wings in a void? [sic]. I believe that one who goes out against 

the winds has to be prepared for bouquets and brickbats, for triumphs as well 

as heartbreaks, whether or not one only makes a classic or collects the cash. 

It is this baffling unpredictability that gives edge to the thrill of movie-making.?

A history of the sikhs, vols 1 amp; 2 (Oxford, 

Rs 325 each) by Khushwant Singh is the second edition of this 1963 

work of accessible scholarship covering six centuries of Sikh history (1469-2004). 

Vol 1 describes the formation of the Sikh faith, and looks at documents in Persian, 

Gurmukhi and English. Vol 2 begins with the death of Ranjit Singh, and through 

Operation Blue Star, ends with Manmohan Singh: ?Thus the year 2004 saw two Sikhs 

at the helm of the country?s affairs [the other one is Montek Singh Ahluwalia] 

? a notional fulfilment of the prophecy Raj Karega Khalsa ? The Khalsa 

Shall Rule.?

Piece of cake (Penguin, Rs 250) by 

Swati Kaushal is a clever Bridget Jones clone ? cool and corporate 

? written by an IIM Calcutta MBA who worked for Nestl? and Nokia, and now lives, 

with family, in Minneapolis. The writing is unflaggingly perky and staccato and 

the heroine, Minal Sharma, a 29-year-old MBA whose parents, colleagues, friends 

and lovers combine native-Indian and global-corporate to keep up the typical ?sparkle 

and mischief? of this modish genre of fiction. ?An hour later I washed down the 

last of the resentment with the rest of the beer and lay back on the sofa to contemplate 

my size-ten feet and plan my future strategy. This was a wake-up call; I had no 

illusions about it.?

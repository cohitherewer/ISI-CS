 RULED OUT

 In a way, president?s rule lives up to the mandate in Bihar. The people voted for change but were still uncertain about the new dispensation, thereby throwing up a hung assembly. With the imposition of the Centre?s rule, the people have the change they wanted ? from the fifteen-year rule of Mr Laloo Prasad Yadav, by himself or by his wife, Ms Rabri Devi, as the chief minister by proxy. At the same time, the fractured mandate made it difficult for the governor, Mr Buta Singh, to settle for a new regime. There were cases in the recent past when the single largest party or pre-poll alliance had been allowed to form a minority government. But two things seem to have made such a decision difficult for the Union home ministry. First, offering such an opportunity to Mr Yadav?s Rashtriya Janata Dal and its allies would have violated the mandate for change and deepened the rift within the United Progressive Alliance. Mr Ram Vilas Paswan, Mr Yadav?s colleague in the UPA government at the Centre, had made it clear that he would do anything to stop the RJD from returning to power in Patna. Second, after the damage suffered in Goa and Jharkhand, the Union government could not risk another muddle in Bihar. President?s rule has earned the beleaguered Congress leadership a reprieve. 

 However, the Centre?s rule could see the beginning of the next phase in Bihar?s complex politics. With Mr Yadav?s long and unchallenged reign over, other parties, including the UPA partners, will definitely compete to expand their own space. Since the new assembly has been kept in suspended animation, the parties will try to multiply their flock, hoping to muster a majority by the time the assembly is convened. But even this new game will be subject to the compulsions of keeping the UPA intact in New Delhi. The people of Bihar would, however, like to see other things happening during president?s rule. They would like to see the interim administration lift the state from the abyss into which it has sunk, thanks mainly to the politicians who have violated with impunity all norms of civilized conduct. President?s rule would thus be an acid test for the governor and his mentors in New Delhi. It would be na?ve to expect it to be an easy task; the malaise has struck too deep for cosmetic cures. But Bihar desperately needs at least an honest attempt at cleaning up the mess.

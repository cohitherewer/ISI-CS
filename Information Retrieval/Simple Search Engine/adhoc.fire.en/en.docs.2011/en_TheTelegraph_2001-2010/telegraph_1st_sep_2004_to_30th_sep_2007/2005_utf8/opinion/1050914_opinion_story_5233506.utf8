 ALMOST FRIENDS

 It would have been nice for the Bharatiya Janata Party if its two most visible leaders could have kissed and made up, metaphorically speaking. But as the smoke clears after the fracas over Mr Madan Lal Khurana, knottier problems seem to be revealing themselves. They were always there, behind Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee?s open condemnation of Mr L.K. Advani?s decision to expel Mr Khurana. The sticking point was that Mr Advani did what he did without discussion, that is, the BJP chief acted unilaterally. But the point being made about the importance of ?consensus? is a polite disguise for the realities of power. Whose is to be the last word in a party that still draws on one personality for its broadly acceptable image: the man who provides the image or the man who is now party chief? Mr Advani?s following is certainly something to be reckoned with. But it is pitched against Mr Vajpayee?s stature, his reputation as former prime minister, his diplomacy, political acuteness and the enormous admiration he commands among people. There is more. In spite of his careful distancing of himself from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh whenever circumstances so demand, of his delicate walking of the tightrope of political expediency, Mr Vajpayee?s word still carries weight with the RSS when Mr Advani is out of favour with the parent body. That is a form of power difficult to contend with.

 The compromise has worked well. Mr Khurana has apologized to Mr Advani for his remarks, the party has met and ?consented? to have his expulsion revoked. Mr Vajpayee has made a point, and Mr Advani has been given a dignified space for partial retreat. But there is another battle to be fought ? over Mr Narendra Modi. Mr Vajpayee is known to have a very long memory, and he has not forgotten the party?s ?consensus? that Mr Modi remain at the time he had wanted Mr Modi out. Mr Vajpayee has made his presence felt, it would seem, just as a preliminary to that tussle. Dissidence in the Gujarat BJP has been growing and the forthcoming panchayat and civic elections in the state could turn out to be a hard test for Mr Modi. An open disagreement between the two biggest leaders may be the worst thing now for the troubled BJP.

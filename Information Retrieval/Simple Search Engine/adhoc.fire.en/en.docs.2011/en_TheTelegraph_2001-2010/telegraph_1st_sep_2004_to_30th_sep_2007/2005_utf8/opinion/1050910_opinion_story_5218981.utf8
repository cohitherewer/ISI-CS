 THE SOLITARY LEAPER

 Medal or no medal, 

 Anju Bobby George rsquo;s story is an 

 epic tale of grit, determination 

 mdash; and parental ambition

 As symbols go, this one is particularly telling. When Kerala caterer K.T. Markose dropped the initial letter from daughter Manjus name, he didnt have numerology on his mind. He had an eye, instead, on the alphabetically-set school rolls, where an A got precedence over an M.

 And so Anju was born. And, quite like her far-sighted father, she has been looking ahead since then: centimetre by centimetre, and notch by notch.

 Which is why, when Anju Bobby George ? ?e Manju Markose ? won a gold medal on Sunday with a jump of 6.65 metres at the Asian Athletics Championships in South Korea, she went up the global ladder of long jumpers. 

 Anju, who ranked 61 in the world barely four years ago, went up two spots to the seventh place in the latest world rankings released by the International Association of Athletics Federation. But Sania Mirza was still in the news those days ? so Anju, 28, had to make do with left-over newsprint and airtime.

 Public memory is a fickle mistress ? all there when the going is good, and straying shamelessly when its not. This time last year, days before the Olympics, Anju was the poster girl of Indian sports. And then, when she had to leave Athens without a medal, she was, even if not quite a four-letter-word, no longer smelling of roses. She had touched 6.83 metres on her first jump in the final, breaking her own national record of 6.74 metres. But in a field where success is measured by the strength of metal, a sixth position is as bad as the last. And a miss as good as a centimetre.

 She has to improve, says Milkha Singh, once known as the Flying Sikh. The government is spending so much money on her, but she is not getting any better, says the Chandigarh-based former runner. 

 Clearly, despite the gold, salvos have started flying. Though she was the first Indian athlete to win a medal at a world championship ? a bronze in Paris two years ago ? its the elusive Olympic medal that seems to be coming between Anju and the high table.

 But medal or no medal, her story is an interesting one: an epic tale of grit, determination ? and parental ambition. Anju grew up in Cheeranchira, near Changanacherry in central Kerala. 

 When she was four, she won her first lemon-in-a-teaspoon race, after reportedly practising for four days. It was Sister Gracelin of the Lisieux L.P. School ? where young Anju studied ? who first discovered her lightning strides. But the school only had a plot of uncultivated land for a playground, and the only time Anju could underscore her athletic skills was when her school took her to various meets.

 There was no ground near our village, so we had to take her to a club ground nine kilometres away for practice every day, says Anjus mother, Gracy Markose. Everyday, Anju would be dragged out of bed ? often crying ? and seated on her fathers bicycle, and he would pedal his way to the practice ground. Those were hard days, says Gracy.

 Things started looking up when the legendary coach, K.P. Thomas, started training Anju after she joined the C.K. Kesavan Memorial School at Korthudu, Kottayam. And though she was a good all-rounder, Thomas focused her attention on the long jump ? before passing the coaching baton to T.P. Ouseph when she moved to Vimala College in Thrissur. I had realised her potential when she started to practise with me, says Ouseph.

 And then, champion triple-jumper, Bobby George came into her life ? first as a coach, and then as husband. Bobby belonged to a family of sportsmen ? his father had raised his own volleyball team with his eight talented sons. 

 Bobby instilled confidence in my sister by training and supporting her, says Anjus brother, Ajith ? a university-level jumper. He took her to foreign countries, giving her the international exposure that she needed badly.

 With their stints abroad, Anju and Bobby added a glamour quotient to a sport that has always been a poor cousin of games such as tennis and cricket. Anju trained under the American champion jumper, Mike Powell, and was the first Indian sportswoman to sign up with a top international sports management agency. And last year in Athens, Nike signed her up for an endorsement. For the much neglected Indian athletics lobby, this was good news.

 Society is overawed by cricket and tennis, generally the preserve of the rich, says Gracy. Nobody offered much support to Anju until she made a mark at the national level, she holds. 

 Anju, too, has often complained about lack of corporate support and funds. Training abroad costs money, she says, and corporate houses ? which sponsor other sports in a big way ? seldom come forward to help athletes. The only sponsor she has is a local construction firm called Sobha Developers.

 The Indian Athletics Federation is equally bitter. People dont seem to know that 210 countries in the world have athletics, unlike sports that are played in five or six nations, says the secretary of the Federation, Lalit Bhanot. I dont know why athletics faces a step-motherly treatment. But what I know is that Anju is going to continue to win.

 Clearly, Anju has her admirers. Her former coach ? Thomas Sir, as she calls him ? is convinced that she will win a gold at the next Olympics. I have been dreaming of Anju winning Olympic laurels ever since my encounter with her, he says. Thomas even believes that Anju will put off having a baby till the 2008 games in Beijing.

 And Anju, meanwhile, moves on, little by little ? egged on by her own dream of the perfect jump. The dream, she told a journalist recently, has her taking off in the air. I am flying, she says. And I never land.

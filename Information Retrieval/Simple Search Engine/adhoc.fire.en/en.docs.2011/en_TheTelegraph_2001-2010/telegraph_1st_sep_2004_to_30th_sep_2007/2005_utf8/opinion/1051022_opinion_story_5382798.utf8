 ONLY TWO NOTCHES UP

 There are cases where a relative improvement brings no joy. It is somewhat like the improvement in the condition of a patient who everyone knows is terminally ill. Thus there is no reason to rejoice in the announcement that India?s position has improved by two notches in the corruption perception index. This index is prepared by Transparency International. Last year, according to this index India was ranked 90th among 159 nations. This year its position is 88th. It is important to remember that this is a perception index and therefore not really a reflection of the existing reality. This is what those who were part of the sample and responded to the survey ? businessmen, officials, academics and so on ? thought about the existence of corrupt practices in India. The actual occurrence of corruption is better comprehended in the Global Corruption Barometer which is based on a public opinion survey. Ranked 88 among 159 countries, India is somewhere midway in the list. But what is noteworthy are the countries tied with India ? Armenia, Benin, Bosnia, Herzegovina, Gabon, Iran, Mali, Moldova and Tanzania. None of these countries is comparable to India in size, in growth potential and as an investment destination. There is one other thing that needs to be underlined. The corruption perception index measures countries on a score card ranging from zero to ten. Zero represents the most corrupt and ten the least. Three is considered a threshold score; scores below that reveal serious problems relating to corruption. India has scored 2.9, an improvement from 2.8 last year.

 The index will surprise nobody who knows India or lives in India. Corruption and the power of corruption are among the best known features of Indian life, and have been so for some time. It will be difficult to find someone in India who has not encountered corruption in some form or another. Forms of corruption vary from petty ones like bribing a train ticket collector or a police constable to corrupt practices linked to government procurements. There is also the practice of large corporations distributing largesse to secure deals which require the sanction of the government.

 This might suggest the conclusion that economic development and prosperity engender corruption. This is not warranted by the index, since, according to it, some economically developed and affluent countries are very high on the list. Both Great Britain and the Netherlands rank 11th and the United States of America ranks 17th. Singapore has a score of over nine. What is remarkable is that countries of the third world, written off as ?basket cases?, are all ranked poorly. Bangladesh and Chad are both ranked at 158, and Myanmar at 155. Corruption seems to be emerging as a problem of the third world. If this is indeed the case then it can be hoped that liberalization takes India out of the third world orbit, and corruption will decline and India?s score will cross the threshold score of three.

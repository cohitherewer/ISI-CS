 WHEN OUR FILMS WERE ALSO THEIR FILMS

 MIND THE GAP

 Couldn?t some of the city theatres resume their old routine of showing the classics?

 I think there is something quite obscene about paying more than Rs 100 to watch a film ? in Calcutta. Because this is where we have seen some of the most memorable films of our lives for Rs 5 ? at Nandan. How long ago was it? Six years? Seven years? And except for a hole in the handle of your seat to place your twenty-rupee glass of fizzy drink, I don?t see what an Inox offers that a Nandan does not.

 But perhaps this is sounding like a half-baked socialist?s rant. Which is the last thing this piece wants to be. It just wants to ask: Is it worth spending Rs 130 or Rs 150 for films like Kya Kool Hai Hum or Miss Congeniality 2? 

 Half ? or more than half ? of young Calcutta will probably say, ?of course?. This half does not really worry me. It is the rest of Calcutta that does. There must be many Calcuttans ? almost all of them past youth, a handful still young, hopefully ? who have seen Hollywood classics in the morning shows at Metro, and worldcinema classics at Nandan, and even smaller theatres such as Minerva, Jyoti and New Cinema. Have they reconciled themselves to the new diet of Bollywood glitz and Hollywood mush? 

 Many have, but some have not. They still hope Nandan will bring some of the classics and the new works of contemporary filmmakers from time to time. But the hopes are belied. The showpiece of the communist government?s cultural inclination has ceased to be a vehicle of the new wave of world cinema ? almost in a gesture of magnanimity towards the multiplexes. Nandan does not feature these days in the ?listings? section of the newspapers (neither do most of the theatres outside the multiplexes), perhaps because half the time, it is not showing any film at all. And when there is a festival organized by one of the film clubs, no one seems to know how tickets or passes can be procured.

 So how does one watch old classics, or non-Hollywood or -Bollywood films in Calcutta? On DVDs and VCDs, of course. DVD players have come within the reach of the middle classes, and there is a glut of DVDs and VCDs at the stores. But what happens if you want to watch Fellini?s Amarcord, or Bergman?s Smiles of a Summer?s Night, or even a Hollywood film like Woody Allen?s Hannah?s Sisters? In most plush stores and VCD libraries in the city, you would be greeted with blank looks if you mention these names. One or two lending libraries have a few Bu?uels and Almodovars, but in a city like Calcutta, these form a drop in the ocean. 

 Just across the border from Bengal, in Dhaka, a friend picked up Almodovars, Truffauts, Kurosawas, Herzogs ? for 100 taka or Rs 80 apiece ? from a tiny shop. The many larger shops dotting the city have a bigger fare. I hear that some of them are following the illegal route to Calcutta. (Legal or illegal, this will make a lot of people happy.)

 Wouldn?t it be so much simpler if some of the city theatres went back to their old routine of showing the classics? And Nandan resumed being the Calcuttan?s window to contemporary world cinema? We would be more than happy if Inox joined in. After all, it is not a question of spending money, but it is what you get with the money you spend.

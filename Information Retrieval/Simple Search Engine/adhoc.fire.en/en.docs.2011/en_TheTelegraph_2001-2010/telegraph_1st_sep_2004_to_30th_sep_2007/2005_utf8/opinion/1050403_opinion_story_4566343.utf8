 DIARY

 His thick baritone and gravity of manner may have given Jaswant Singh a very becoming dignity when he was cabinet minister, but now, when he is simply one among many opposition leaders, they make him seem more than a little ridiculous. Journalists, for one, now do not have the patience to make sense of the garbled accents. This was proving to be a problem for the BJP since Singh is probably the only one in the party whose views on world affairs and finance carry any weight. So the party?s media cell has made it its business to help the poor souls whose business it is to make sense of Jaswant?s jargon. Thus, press releases of a Jaswant Singh briefing are handed out before ? and not after. Now the scribes at least have some signposts to help them along. The army major-turned politician too is not complaining if his performance at the press briefing on the sale of F-16s to Pakistan last week is anything to go by. In front of the cameras and before the microphones, Jaswant read out the media release, correcting grammatical errors loudly as he went along. That done, he smiled and announced: ?I am now ready to answer all questions directly related to F-16s, indirectly related to F-16s and tangentially related to F-16s.? Well, his articulation may leave a lot to be desired, but his general language skills are good enough for him to teach the journos a few turns of phrases. Is Jaswant listening?

 One would have thought that at eighty-plus, ND Tiwari is ready to give up on public life. The CM of Uttaranchal also has enough enemies who can?t wait to see the back of him. But the wily old politician is not going to hang up his boots without ensuring he gets something in return. And Tiwari has a veritable wish list. One, he wants his close associate, Indira Hardesh to succeed him in the gaddi in Dehradun (Sonia isn?t about to oblige), and two, he wants to spend some time in the Raj Bhavan (Sonia will be quite happy to grant this one) ? in either Jaipur or Mumbai (no way!). If only wishes were horses....

 The golden rule for Congress ministers seems to be ? however you may goof up with other administrative matters, you?ve got to deliver when it comes to the Common Minimum Programme. HR Bharadwaj seems to have fallen foul of this unspoken edict, and will, rumours have it, pay for it in the cabinet reshuffle scheduled tentatively for May. No, it isn?t about the Jharkhand fiasco again, or the Union law minister?s alleged misleading of the party and the PM about the inadvisability of seeking a presidential reference. Bharadwaj?s sin is more cardinal. His ministry, it seems, is sitting on a file that concerns an issue very close to Sonia Gandhi?s heart ? the Kargil purchases and George Fernandes?s role in them. The Supreme Court, which is hearing a civil writ petition on the case, had asked the government for its reply, but it has not come despite five deadlines having passed and it being close to a year since the Congress-led government came to power. Indeed, if you can?t use your office to nail your opponents, then you might as well give up.

 When the chips are down, everything seems to go wrong all at once and nothing you do helps. Look at the BJP. The leadership is flummoxed at the party?s constantly dipping popularity even in its former strongholds, UP, MP and Gujarat. At the chintan shivir held after the Lok Sabha debacle, the party had decided that in UP at any rate, it needed a Brahmin like Kesrinath Tiwari at the helm to stop the upper castes from switching over to the Congress. Alas, the move has come a cropper. The thinking now is, bring in Rajnath Singh, the hero of Jharkhand. But that?s old wine in a new bottle ? the man?s already been president of the BJP state unit and also UP chief minister. Singh may, or may not, work the necessary magic, but you can?t blame the BJP for not trying. 

 She had been dubbed the ?sphinx? when she first joined politics. Sonia Gandhi may have shed most of that aura in recent times, but she still remains very choosy about the company she is seen in. She didn?t make it to the high-profile bash hosted by Rajiv Shukla in honour of Shah Rukh Khan and Anil Kumble getting the Padma awards. And neither did she show up at Subbirami Reddy?s grand do. She was eagerly awaited at Ajit Jogi?s; and at Ghulam Nabi Azad?s Holi Milan, ?madam? was supposed to be coming any minute ? only she never turned up. Congressmen, of course, attribute Sonia?s absence to her decision not to celebrate Holi in view of the Tsunami. The communal cats however have it that it being Easter Sunday was a more likely reason why she didn?t come. 

 If Shah Rukh Khan was disappointed at Sonia Gandhi?s no-show at Rajiv Shukla?s party, he was not to be so for long. For Priyanka Gandhi came down to Mumbai to visit him at the sets of a film he was shooting in. Tongues, of course, immediately went wagging about how the lady had offered him a role in politics. But hold it ? according to Shukla, the Bollywood badshah?s friend and well-wisher in Delhi, the two have been friends ever since Shah Rukh was a student in Delhi. The acquaintance has been rejuvenated at the insistence of Rehan and Meera, Priyanka?s children, who like millions of kids elsewhere in the country, are diehard fans of the actor. So the Mumbai visit was more pleasure than business, for the lady at least. But was it so for the Khan too? After all, Shah Rukh?s Congress leanings are no secret, and with even a Nagma harbouring ambitions of a post-retirement career in politics, it wouldn?t be a surprise if he did.

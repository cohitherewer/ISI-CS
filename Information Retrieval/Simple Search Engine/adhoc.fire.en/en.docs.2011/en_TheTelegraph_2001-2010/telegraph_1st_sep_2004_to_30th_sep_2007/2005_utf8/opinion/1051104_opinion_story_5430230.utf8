 A CHRONICLE OF DEATH

 Beasts of no nation 

 By Uzodinma Iweala, 

 John Murray, ? 12.99

 The Dark Continent has produced a pantheon of literary stars. Nigerian writer, Uzodinma Iweala, is the latest in that illustrious line. Born in the US and educated at Harvard, Uzodinma?s soul is nevertheless bound to his African homeland.

 When the European colonists finally withdrew, after centuries of exploitation, they left behind a ravaged Africa in the throes of anarchy. Overnight, banana republics sprang up all over the continent. Tinpot dictators seized power; governments were routinely toppled and civil wars rent countries apart. Against this volatile backdrop, Uzodinma?s tale unfolds.

 Beasts of No Nation is the story of young Agu ? of how an innocent victim is transformed into a hardened killer. This is also the story of Africa itself. 

 ?I was able to expel from my mind all human hope. On every form of joy, in order to strangle it, I pounced stealthily like a wild animal? ? Rimbaud?s famous lines serve as a fitting prologue to the novel.

 One day, war comes to Agu?s village and the young boy?s idyllic life is shattered forever. The commandant and his ragtag army of rebels rescue Agu after the government forces have devastated his village. A reluctant Agu is soon recruited by the commandant, and then begins the young boy?s inexorable descent into an abyss of perverse violence and bloodlust. ?I am liking how the gun is shooting and the knife is chopping. I am liking to see people running from me when I am killing them and taking their blood. I am liking to kill.? In his simple, unadorned style, Uzodinma sketches the tragic horror of a civil war. 

 Uzodinma writes in a unique style. Grammar and punctuation have all been thrown out of the window. What emerges is a vibrant, staccato language that mimes the phonetics of an African dialect. This accounts for the visceral, authentic feel to the novel.

 Twenty-two-year-old Uzodinma Iweala is a writer of great promise. He writes with an eye for detail and graphically captures the anguish of a continent and the angst of a generation. There can be no doubt that his literary presence will make itself felt in the years ahead. Beasts of No Nation makes for a rivetting read.

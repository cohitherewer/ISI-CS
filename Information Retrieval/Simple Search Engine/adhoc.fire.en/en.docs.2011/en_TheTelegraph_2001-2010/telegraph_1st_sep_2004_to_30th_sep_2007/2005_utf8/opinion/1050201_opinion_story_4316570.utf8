 Letters to Editor

 Fund management

 Sir ? It seems that the Left Front has a bone to pick with the Central government on everything that the latter suggests. Look how horrified it appears at the government?s suggestion that non-government provident, superannuation and gratuity funds can invest up to five per cent of their reserves in stock markets and another ten per cent in corporate debt and equity-linked mutual funds (?PF cash adds fuel to market on fire?, Jan 29). Such a deployment of funds may enhance workers? savings ? and surely this is a much better way to do it than strain the budget to give a 9.5 per cent interest (as the left is now demanding)? Besides, a notable leftist was heard griping only a few days back about the dangers of excessive dependence on foreign funds. His clan would do well to remember that the enhanced liquidity in the markets that the government?s proposal would bring about will reduce such dependence. 

 Yours faithfully,

Anindya Ghosh, Calcutta

 True lies

 Sir ? Pratap Bhanu Mehta?s warning that ?truth will remain hostage to politics? so far as Godhra is concerned is a fact that cannot be forgotten in a hurry (?The end of truth?, Jan 29). Mehta has enough reasons to be sceptical about the findings of the interim U.C. Banerjee report. And the timing of the report amply proves that Banerjee has allowed himself to be used as a rubber stamp by the ?honourable? railway minister, Laloo Prasad Yadav. If distinguished members of the judiciary become amenable to political control, will future commissions or committees headed by them have any credibility?

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? In ?The end of truth?, Pratap Bhanu Mehta voices the worries of a majority of Indians. But contrary to Mehta?s belief, the ?truth? might not be lost forever. If U.C. Banerjee?s proximity to politicians can be proved, another attempt can be made to salvage Godhra?s real story. Banerjee may have suppressed smaller truths to get at the ?greater truth? that will suit the political moment. But his cannot be the last word on the issue. 

 Yours sincerely,

Abhijit Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? As Pratap Bhanu Mehta rightly observes, the interim report on Godhra makes a victim of the truth. What is also questionable is the sermon on secularism in the preamble of the report. But U.C. Banerjee?s finding leaves many questions unanswered. Even if one were to go with the accident theory, there remains the fact that the marauding crowd which gathered outside the burning coach had started pelting stones to prevent people from coming out of the train. This makes them party to the crime.

 Yours faithfully, 

Ashok Kumar Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is not entirely unexpected that two commissions appointed by two very different governments have come up with contradictory reports. Do we require a ?third umpire?, as in cricket, to come to a definite conclusion in such matters? 

 Yours faithfully,

C.V.K. Moorthy, Calcutta

 Sir ? Why does Pratap Bhanu Mehta believe that there is, and has to be, one truth about Godhra? All events recorded for posterity are a selective process by which some ?truths? are left out, and some retained. It all depends on who is the recorder. The same theory works in the Godhra case. If the previous commission, appointed by the saffron government, highlighted only facts that lent credence to its ?conspiracy? theory, the present report has used those that will support its theory of the fire being an accident. The truth about Godhra can never be retrieved.

 Yours faithfully,

J. Chatterjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? Clearly, the evidence of the Godhra train fire is being manipulated to suit political interests. Some of it has probably already been destroyed.

 Yours faithfully,

N. Srivastava, Calcutta

 Time to clean up

 Sir ? Subrata Mukherjee has launched the ?Year of Cleaner City? campaign that will see us boycotting shops and households that dump garbage on the road. Such a campaign is much needed in Calcutta. I have a request for the honourable minister of the municipal affairs department. The garbage generated daily in Writers? Buildings is dumped on the roadside and very little space is available on the main road for pedestrians? use. The conservancy department does not clear the garbage till late in the afternoon. Consequently, office-goers to the Lyons Range and India Exchange Place, as well as adjacent areas, have to bear the stink of the garbage. No bleaching powder or chemicals are used to reduce the stench even after the garbage has been cleared. Incidentally, the Writers? Buildings is a heritage structure and it is only expected that it should have a clean and presentable surrounding. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sankar Lal Singh, Calcutta

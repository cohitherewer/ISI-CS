 MORE CONTROL

 Private schools in West Bengal get to see a peculiar aspect of the Left Front government. This is a strange mix of anxiety and officiousness that tries to pass itself off as a concern for quality, but ends up being a deep discomfort with autonomy and self-regulation. This has something to do, perhaps, not only with the fact that these are private schools, but also with their being English-medium (and therefore ?elitist?) schools under the Central and ?Delhi? boards. This time, the government has formed a committee, which is going to grade the schools into three categories: A, A+ and A++. This classification will be founded on criteria like tuition and other fees, quality of teaching, infrastructure, results, co-curricular activities, and so on. This would involve the setting of ?benchmarks? by the government as well as the regulation of the maximum fee-hike for each category of schools. In short, the government will have greater vigilance over and control of these schools. In fact, the extent of this control would be quite unprecedented.

 There is a grim irony in the government setting itself up as the monitoring body for the state?s private schools. The government schools in West Bengal continue to be living testimonies of the systematic ruining of an education system at every level, from the pedagogy to infrastructure. For decades, the government has been conducting a series of disastrous experiments with the medium of instruction, exposing a set of benighted prejudices against the teaching of English. The training of teachers has also been consistently mismanaged. So, quite apart from the general undesirability of state-control in education, this particular government?s credentials with regard to quality education are seriously dubious. The West Bengal government should, therefore, re-examine the nature of, and the motives behind, its eagerness to regulate the running of the state?s private schools.

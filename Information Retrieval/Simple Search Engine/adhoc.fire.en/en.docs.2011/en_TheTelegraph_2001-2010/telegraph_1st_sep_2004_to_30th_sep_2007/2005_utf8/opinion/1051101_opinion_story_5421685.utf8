 Extracts from the government of India?s status report on Disaster Management in India, August 2004

 Disaster mitigation concerns/aspects may be made an essential term of reference for every plan project/development scheme in the areas vulnerable to disasters. In other words, every plan project will need to state as to how it addresses mitigation concerns. Plans/projects specifically addressing mitigation/ prevention may be given a priority. The secretary of department of disaster management may be made a member for all bodies/ teams constituted for scrutinizing/approving projects/plans. 

 (vii) Funds available under the ongoing schemes may be used for mitigation/ preparedness. For example funds under the rural development scheme can be used for construction of cycle shelters in areas prone to cyclones. Similarly, sites and designs of primary school buildings in flood prone areas may be so selected that they can serve as shelters in times of floods. The design requirements for primary school building and hospitals and other important public buildings in seismic zones... need to be in accordance with BIS norms for construction in these zones.

 (viii) Every hazard prone district may draw up specific hazard related plans. These plans may be reviewed/updated in the months of April and May each year.

 (ix) Every district located in area prone to hazard will need to maintain an online inventory of resources available in the government, public and private sector. This will enable easy and quick mobilization of resources in case of need...

 (x) State in seismic zone...may ensure that the BIS building codes...have been adopted and are rigorously enforced by the municipal bodies. All construction in the government sector in these areas must conform to the BIS code.

 (xi) The initial training curriculum of the field staff ? VLWs, karamcharis, patwaris, talhatis, block agriculture officers, block animal husbandry officers other block supervisors, state civil service officers, constables, sub-inspectors, deputy superintendents etc. ? in the states vulnerable to hazards may include capsules on basic dos and don?ts in case of disasters; disaster mitigation and response, search and rescues techniques etc. In-service training may be organized for staff already in service.

 (xii) Special efforts may be put in for education and awareness. This should include awareness of basic design requirements for constructing private housing in seismic zones...as well as in the belt vulnerable to cyclones.

 (xiii) AICTE have been advised to include engineering aspects of disaster mitigation in the engineering courses at the undergraduate level. State governments may take similar action with reference to engineering colleges under their universities. 

 (xiv) CBSE have been advised to include basic disaster related material in textbooks for classes VIII, IX and X ? the basic dos and don?ts / precaution to be taken etc. State government may advise their secondary boards of education to include similar in their textbooks.

 HOME AND THE WORLD

 Time was when Bengalis could easily bring together their home and the world. One has only to think of the attempt by Michael Madhusudan Dutt in the 19th century to write a Petrarchan sonnet in Bengali. That endeavour had its own grandeur. Anglophone education had opened up to Bengalis the achievements of European literature. Men like Dutt and Bankimchandra Chattopadhyay attempted, with no little success, to emulate those achievements in poetry and in the novel. Their themes were Indian, but the form they adopted was distinctly European. Bengali literature, in its best moments, has excelled in mingling the best of the world with the best in Bengal. In this sense, Bengali literature has always set itself global standards. In the second half of the 20th century, the film-maker, Satyajit Ray, set himself the same challenge of capturing local themes in cinematic terms that were nothing if not global. If some sections of Bengali society in their social mores and attitudes have revelled in ?Little Bengal?, Bengali creativity has aspired to be global.

 There has, however, been one field in which Bengalis have never come anywhere near sniffing distance of global standards. This is the field of business. Since the somewhat meteoric rise and fall of the business enterprises of Dwarakanath Tagore, successful Bengali business ventures, for one reason or another, have been few and far between. But this trend has perhaps been broken with the acquisition of Basell, the Netherlands-based company, by a group of investors led by Mr Purnendu Chatterjee. Mr Chatterjee?s origins lie in Bengal, but in his chosen field he is the global player par excellence. The source of his funds is global and his business interests are strewn across the globe ? from remote Haldia in West Bengal to the United States of America to the Netherlands. Mr Chatterjee is the quintessential global Bengali. He is seriously and sincerely involved in the project to bring investment to West Bengal and to help it industrialize. But he wants to do this in global terms. But his global vision in no way undermines his Bengaliness. He has literally brought the world to his home.

 Mr Chatterjee?s success in one sense harks back to the 19th century when in the field of literature, the home and the world became one in the creativity of Bengalis. But more importantly, it also looks forward. The presence of a Bengali is now being felt in the world of business at a time when a new mood of hope and optimism is also emerging in West Bengal. This new mood is related directly to business and investment ? areas which Bengalis of previous generations scoffed at. In the present juncture, business and investment have global finance and global markets as their reference points. This new mood has been forged by Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, a Bengali who once loved world revolution, always loved world literature and now loves global finance. The home and the world are becoming indistinguishable.

 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA

 Abhijit Bhattacharyya

 Notwithstanding what the Americans may have once thought of Indians ? treacherous witches and bastards ? they are not in the habit of capturing power through coups or other illegal means. In fact, India stands as a shining example in the midst of a violent history of military coups and overthrow of civilian governments. Thus, when an appeal is raised from a generally pacific army, it ought to be given credence.

 Way back in 1996, the then admiral of the Indian navy, V.S. Shekhawat, had strongly criticized the government for its inability to provide a modern fleet for the nation. His successor, Vishnu Bhagwat, too alleged the defence minister and secretary of being ignorant of the nation?s needs. Bhagwat may have pushed things, but even his worst critics cannot accuse him of incompetence. Seven years after this, another Indian admiral pointed out that the delay in modernizing the Indian submarine fleet could create a possible ?vacuum? in combat strength. But the admiral?s complaints came at a bad time. Jane?s Fighting Ships 2004-2005 has commented on the ?significant Indian progress in other surface ship programmes? like the three Project 15A destroyers. 

 Ultimate design

 It further observed that the best of the Indian naval ship-building programme is likely to be achieved with the modified variants of the ?Talwar? class, the ?Shivalik? class and subsequent ships to be delivered at one-year intervals. This was to be the core frigate programme. The Indian ship-building industry looks all set to achieve an unprecedented rate of construction, which ?signals the end of Indian reliance on foreign builders?. 

 But the success in ship-building does not match the Indian navy?s submarine programmes, which according to Jane?s, appear to have made little progress. In fact, although India plans to acquire 24 new conventionally powered submarines to replace the current force of 16 submarines (of Russian and German origin) by 2030, ?negotiations for the procurement of French Scorpene? class boats are yet to be concluded. Neither has there been any progress on buying six ?Amur 1650? boats from Russia.

 Since the submarine is the ultimate in sea offensive, the Indian picture does not seem rosy. All the more if one compares the present fleet strength with that operating 10 years ago. In 1994, the Indian squadron consisted of 18 submarines while Pakistan?s was made up of six. Today, Pakistan has eight, while India?s strength has gone down to 16. 

 Real problems

 The aircraft carrier has been the strongest visible arm of the Indian navy. Unfortunately, there is now one ? INS Viraat ? instead of two. Although India has succeeded in clinching the Russian carrier Gorshkov, the programme has its own risk. Viraat is already 46 years old and the new air defence ship can not be launched before 2011-2012 at the earliest. 

 The causes for worry should be obvious. Add to this the basic Indian characteristics ? of making allegations (real or unreal), and countering them with venomous and vitriolic counter-allegations. Whether all Indians are corrupt or not is not the point. The point is that today virtually every Indian in power is scared of sanctioning the purchase of high-value military hardware. If a submarine is to be selected, it has to fulfil all the parameters of combat quality. And finally the ?price?. Ironically, the pricing factor is taking a heavy toll on India, be it that of the aircraft carrier, the MiG-29 K from Russia, Denel guns from South Africa, Scorpene submarines from France, Bofors Howitzer from Sweden, T-90 battle tanks from Ukraine or fighter aircraft. The indecision and allegations just go on. No wonder the admirals shriek.

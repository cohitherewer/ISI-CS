 HOLY MADNESS

 Holiness is spreading through Madhya Pradesh like a terrible contagion. First Amarkantak, Maheshwar and Ujjain, and now Orchha, Maihar and Chitrakoot ? town after town is catching the epidemic, to purge itself of all earthly dross and emerge as pure as driven snow. It started with Ms Uma Bharti, then the chief minister, declaring the first three pilgrimage spots ?holy?. This meant a ban on the sale of eggs, meat, fish and alcohol. Not satisfied with this, she even forced sex-workers to shut shop and banned, with the support of some local sadhus and mahants, the distribution of ?evil condoms? during the Kumbh mela. The mela is known to be frequented by foreigners and Hollywood stars, and Hinduism must not be given a bad name to these visitors.

 There was something perversely ?right? about this bottomless insanity emanating from Ms Bharti. She had always embodied ? in her person, conduct and views ? the lunatic fringe of the sangh parivar. And the Bharatiya Janata Party?s occasional embarrassed attempts at putting her in her place made for some minor drollery in the sordid non-drama of Hindutva politics. But the fact remained that there was room within mainstream Indian politics for such pernicious insanity. But nothing has changed in Madhya Pradesh. Mr Babulal Gaur has taken up Ms Bharti?s baton and three more towns have been made holy. This time, the definition of holiness has been extended to include ?multinational? soft drinks like Pepsi and Coca-Cola. To make up for the dietary deprivation brought on by the banning of eggs and meat, these soft drinks have to be replaced now with the calorific and swadeshi butter milk, lassi and shrikhand. Leaving aside the affront to other religions, and to democratic values, the use of state power to perpetuate such absurd fascism should provoke a sustained and collective resistance in all defenders of democracy and reason.

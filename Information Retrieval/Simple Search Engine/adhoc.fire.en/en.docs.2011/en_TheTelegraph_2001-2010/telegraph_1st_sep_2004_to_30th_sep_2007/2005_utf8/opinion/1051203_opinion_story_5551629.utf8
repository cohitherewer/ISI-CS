 REVEALING FEARS

 Old women can have all the fun. Women in Pushkar in Rajasthan, whether of the soil or from overseas, cannot be touched by men, even their husbands, in public unless they are old or infirm. Good manners are prohibited ? no man is to help a woman get out of a car. Perhaps divine forces will take care of women when they fall. In this thriving and beautiful centre for tourists from within and outside the country, women apparently will be ticked off if they talk to strangers on the street, and hugging, kissing or embracing between men and women in public places is obviously unthinkable. The Ajmer Authority, which has brought out a 20-page booklet with a series of priceless guidelines ?to educate foreign tourists about local culture and sensibilities?, has kindly informed the ignorant that in Indian culture, men socialize with men and women with women. 

 All this could have been seen as a lunatic reaction to complaints about Israeli tourists dancing naked around a fire and a nude Finnish woman walking from her hotel for a dip in the sacred lake. But the symptoms of the disease had been visible earlier too, when an Israeli couple were fined for kissing after being married the Hindu way. So virulent is this form of allergy to the body that the Ajmer Authority is unconscious of the irony of its guidelines. Pushkar may welcome old women, but will it ? given its authorities? puritanical ague ? publicly welcome homosexuals from all over the world too? There should be all-round satisfaction when men socialize with men and women with women. 

 A certain imbalance in cultural encounters is only to be expected in tourist spots. Visitors are supposed to abide by the law of the land they are visiting, and public nudity is against the law in India. For people who are from cultures which require less restraint regarding the display of the body, sensitiveness to the law of the host culture can be expected. But the Ajmer Authority, which, ironically again, seems bent on annihilating the tourist revenue of Pushkar, is not talking about law. Or, rather, it may be pushing the law against indecency to invisible limits. The court there can fine people, wherever they are from, for embracing after getting married. That is astonishing enough, and the booklet takes amazement further when it talks about local culture and sensibilities. In effect, the guidelines are an insult to local inhabitants: they are projected as unnatural, bad-mannered, immature to the point of being moronic, easily led and primeval in their outlook. It is silly enough talking about local sensibilities and culture in a country that has among its tourist spots Khajuraho and Konarak and the Kamasutra ? not to mention far more erotic texts ? in its literature. But the silliest thing is to be terrorized into giving ludicrous orders at the thought of nude foreign bodies.

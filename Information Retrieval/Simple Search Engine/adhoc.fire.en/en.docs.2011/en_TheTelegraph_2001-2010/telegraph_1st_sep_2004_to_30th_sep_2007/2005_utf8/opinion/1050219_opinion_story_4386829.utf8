 HISTORY IN THE BOX 

- Most Indian historians are too timid to take history to the people 

Politics and Play / Ramachandra Guha

 One line is enough 

Unlike economists and sociologists, who usually write 

for their peers, historians have sought to reach a wider audience. This is especially 

so in the United Kingdom, where historians have long seen themselves as writers 

first and academics second. In the 19th century, the most honoured historians 

were based outside the academy; notably, Edward Gibbon, Thomas Babington Macaulay 

and Thomas Carlyle. In the 20th century, scholarship became more institutionalized, 

but some of the best known historians remained on the fringes of university life. 

G.M. Trevelyan and E.P. Thompson both spent long periods as freelance writers; 

although both briefly held university jobs, that was not when their finest books 

were written. Even those who held regular academic positions wrote for a general 

public; consider only the names of Hugh Trevor Roper and A.J.P. Taylor.

This trend has continued down to the present. David 

Cannadine, Simon Schama and Niall Ferguson are only three of the many fine British 

historians who write regularly for newspapers and magazines. And the last two 

have ventured beyond the printed word; into the less certain, but far more lucrative, 

world of television. There are now acclaimed ?tele-historians? in the UK just 

as there are acclaimed (and notorious) ?tele-evangelists? in the United States 

of America. In that little island, history is massively popular on the idiot box. 

Recently, as many as eighteen history programmes were running on primetime in 

the five major channels. Their combined viewership went into the tens of millions.

The problems and possibilities of tele-history are 

discussed in a new book called History and the Media, edited by David Cannadine 

and published by Palgrave. Among its contributors are the historians who have 

advised or anchored the most popular programmes, as well as the producers who 

produced them. Some pieces are autobiographical, others more analytical.

In the UK, tele-history made its mark with two spectacularly 

successful programmes on the world wars, the first introduced by Sir Michael Redgrave, 

the second by Sir Lawrence Olivier. ?Why is so much television history about war?? 

asks Roger Smither. His answer instances the availability of archival footage 

and of survivors? testimonies, but skates over one very important reason ? namely, 

that the wars were won by the countries in which these programmes were made and, 

more importantly, viewed. Naturally, one would expect programmes on the first 

and second world wars to be popular in the UK and the US.

Academics typically denounce TV history on the grounds 

that (to quote Tristram Hunt) the ?demand for drama, spectacle and ?ground-breaking? 

discoveries inevitably overrides subtlety and scholarship?. As the great historian 

of the Nazis, Ian Kershaw, points out, history programmes on television do rest 

on a simple, straight narrative line. TV history is ?far more directive? than 

scholarly history, which raises problems of interpretation and invites disagreements. 

However, the practices of the academic seminar-room will not do for the public, 

since ?problems of interpretation tend to muddy the waters, and to leave the viewer 

confused?.

Hard-boiled academics may see TV history as a ?dumbing 

down?, but from another viewpoint it is a ?lifting-up?, a source of education 

and stimulation for viewers satiated by, and looking for an escape from, serials 

and game shows. For all its problems, tele-history allows one to break out of 

the ?narrowness and introversion of specialist history?. Speaking for the UK (and 

perhaps also for the US), Kershaw observes that ?history on television is here 

to stay. If historians do not help to mould and influence it, others will.?

Based on his own wide experience in print and television, 

the war historian, Max Hastings, posits an inverse relationship between the reach 

of a medium and the penetration of its content. He argues that those who see TV 

rarely take in much of what they see. Penetration is better in print, where, so 

claims Hastings, about a third of the readership might attentively read a serious 

article or feature. Books are the most satisying from this point of view, since 

those who buy them usually read them. Like Kershaw, Hastings is aware of the problems 

with TV history; but like him, he sees also its enormous possibilities in a democratic 

age. As he writes: ?If more academic historians could overcome an instinctive 

disdain for the media, and for the compromises that are inescapable in working 

with it, they would do great service to their own trade as well as to their bank 

balances.?

Kershaw and Hastings are persuasive, but it must be 

said that this book also offers ammunition to the other side. The least impressive 

piece is by Simon Schama ? a random collection of quotes and jokes, a narrative 

marked by a complete lack of coherence. Is this what television can do to a first-rate 

historian? And there is also the example of Niall Ferguson, whose successful series 

on the British and American empires have given him the idea that he cannot just 

study empires, but also advise them, in a clear transgression of the code of the 

historian, who has a mandate to document and interpret, not to prescribe.

Reading History and the Media prompts one to 

reflect on what historians in our country have, or have not, done to take their 

findings to a wider public. In theory, the possibilities are immense. For the 

history of this country is richer and more fascinating than that of the UK or 

the US. It is peopled with unusual characters, and peppered with controversial 

incidents. Surely these can be written about in ways that appeal to the general 

public?

In some parts of India, they have, indeed. Bengal 

is perhaps a leader in this regard, with historians such as the late Ashin Dasgupta 

and Gautam Bhadra writing essays in Bangla for popular periodicals and magazines. 

Across the country, there is the example of Sadanand More, whose historical writings 

in Sakal are read by hundreds of thousands of ordinary Maharashtrians. 

Still, more could be done, much more. For most academic historians in India are 

content to write for their peers, losing themselves in jargon in the process.

The picture when it comes to television is more dismal 

still. If you add, to the characters and incidents, the diversity of our natural 

heritage and the richness of our built one, then Indian history seems tailor-made 

for television. Yet one is hard-put to name a single historical programme well-made 

or well-received. The programmes that exist on Gandhi, Partition and the Nehru-Gandhi 

dynasty were made not by Indian channels but by the British Broadcasting Corporation. 

This is partly the fault of our historians, who have not written books interesting 

enough for a producer to want to film them. It is also the fault of our media, 

which has so comprehensively embraced the cult of glamour and celebrity. When 

there are no serious documentaries on matters of compelling contemporary interest, 

why would we expect Indian television to give us decent history?

Indian historians are, for the most part, too insular 

and timid to take history to the people. Indian media is too vulgar to do so. 

And there is yet a third problem, that in India, history is most contentious, 

productive not just of intellectual argument but also of sectarian violence. If 

heads can be broken and libraries burnt on account of a single line in a book 

about Shivaji, can one imagine the reaction to a series on television about the 

Mughals? Or a series about the national movement? How would we accommodate, in 

one straight, simple narrative, the viewpoints and contributions of Gandhi, Ambedkar, 

Bhagat Singh, Nehru, Bose, Jinnah and Savarkar? These men argued among themselves 

in their lifetime, and their followers fight their battle more fiercely now. How 

to make a programme that is appealing and attractive, and yet won?t spark a hundred 

processions and a dozen bloody riots? Rather than confront the question, it seems 

more prudent to duck it.

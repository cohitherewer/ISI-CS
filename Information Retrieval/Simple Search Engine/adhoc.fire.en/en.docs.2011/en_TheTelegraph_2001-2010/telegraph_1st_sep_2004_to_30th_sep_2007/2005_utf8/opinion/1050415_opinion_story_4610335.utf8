 WHERE?S THE SPIRIT?

 Raju Mukherji

 Frankly, the rule itself has no logic. In 210 minutes, a team is expected to bowl 50 overs. This includes two water breaks as well as time allowed for the incoming and outgoing batsmen to cross each other. If we take out 10 minutes for the two intervals for drinks and a further 20 minutes for 10 wickets, then we have about 3.5 minutes per over. When it is cool, it is convenient to bowl 50 overs in about 180 minutes. But when the temperature hovers around 40 degrees, the issue has to be looked at differently. Delays also take place while moving the sight screens, when players need treatment on the ground, change of balls and so on. We must be able to distinguish between purposeful delay and inadvertent loss of time. ?Time wasted? is unpardonable, but not ?time lost?.

 No complaints

 At Jamshedpur and Ahmedabad, the Indian players just could not go through their overs within the required time frame because of the extreme hot and humid atmosphere. Constant delays took place because the players on either side had to have extra helpings of drinks throughout the day. No cricketer purposely delayed the proceedings. If they had done so, the field umpires would surely have cautioned them. The Pakistan team also did not raise any queries, nor did the 50,000 who thronged the ground, both at Jamshedpur and at Ahmedabad. If the delay did not affect the game, the umpires, the opposition or the crowd then why is the match referee making a fuss?

 One might ask why the Indians could not maintain their over rate when the Pakistanis could? This is a very valid point. The Indian bowlers and fielders are certainly comparatively slower in their movements. But how can only one man be held responsible if ten other adults are slow in their movements? What kind of rule is it that punishes one person for the lethargy of others? 

 Scrap the system

 Perhaps one could conjecture that Broad?s response is a sequel to the Denness episode. A few years ago in South Africa, match referee, Mike Denness, had come down heavily on the Indian team for excessive appealing and tampering with the ball. India had strongly objected to the Denness?s high handedness. But the memory of that episode must have lingered. Clive Lloyd too had similarly punished India last November. At that time, the BCCI, under Jagmohan Dalmiya?s initiative, had fought well, leading to Lloyd?s decision being over-ruled. That is the spirit that we need now.

 It is the lack of perception of judges Denness, Lloyd and Broad that is creating unnecessary bad blood. Is it because of their narrow focus that these men invariably stick to the letter of the law alone? The ICC must appoint referees who are unbiased and have the ability to go beyond the letter of the law, as learned judges do in courts of law.

 The easiest option is to scrap the system of match refereeing. The system has served no worthwhile purpose other than enabling some former players to earn fabulous sums of money. It would be best for the game of cricket if we could go back to those days when the field umpires used their discretion and had the courage to act according to the situation. Even now the laws of cricket provide the field umpires with various provisions to keep the players from straying away from the spirit of cricket.

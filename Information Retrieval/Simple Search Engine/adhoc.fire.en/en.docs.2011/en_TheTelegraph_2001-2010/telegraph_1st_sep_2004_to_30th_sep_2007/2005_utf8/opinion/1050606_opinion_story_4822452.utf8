 DEATH BY THE WINGS

 Gwynne Dyer

 The long-term solution is to invest billions of dollars and a huge amount of political capital in persuad ing peasant families throughout China and south-east Asia to change the way they raise their poultry. The urgent short-term task is to develop a mass-producing influenza vaccine far faster than is now possible. It?s urgent because ?the world is in the gravest possible danger of a global pandemic,? as Shigeru Omi, Western Pacific regional director of the WHO, told an emergency conference on avian flu in Vietnam two months ago.

 The virus first crossed into human beings in 1997, but it has clearly been mutating in ways that make it more capable of moving from birds to people. The spate of human infections in mid-2003 in China and south-east Asia was so serious that over 100 million domestic birds were killed or died before it subsided in early 2004, but there was only a few months? respite before bird-to-human transmission began again.

 The virus has now appeared in wild birds who can carry it far beyond its original reservoir in domestic chickens, China closed all its nature parks after 178 migratory geese were found dead from the virus in Qinghai province. The most recent outbreak has so far killed 53 people in Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia. More ominously, the first case of human-to-human transmission was recorded last September in Vietnam.

 Real danger

 The danger of a global flu pandemic that could be as bad as or worse than the Spanish influenza outbreak of 1918-19 comes from the fact that a strain of influenza virus that normally affects only birds can swap genes with a strain that is highly infectious between human beings. If people with the human type of influenza should also be infected with the avian type, the gene swap can easily occur and direct human-to-human transmission becomes possible. At that point, given current patterns of international travel, the world might be weeks away from a global pandemic.

 The virus is resistant to most anti-viral drugs, and in the avian form, it has been getting stronger. Early outbreaks killed around 10 per cent of poultry flocks; more recent ones have been killing up to 90 percent. In people who have caught avian flu, the death rate has been horrendous: 50 to 75 per cent of those infected. To make matters worse, this version of flu has a long incubation period. Unlike the SARS virus, it may be very hard to stop before it spreads to the population.

 Tough ask

 If infections start to spread, there could be not only huge loss of life, but economic chaos as air travel is shut down, borders are closed, and essential services break down because too many of their workers are off sick or just hiding from the flu at home.

 Governments are arming themselves to deal with this pandemic. President Bush added ?influenza caused by novel or reemergent influenza viruses that are causing, or have the potential to cause, a pandemic? to the list of diseases for which a quarantine can be declared. But there is no vaccine. As things stand now, none could be available for months. That is why five teams of scientists urged a permanent global task force to react quickly to outbreaks of bird flu. 

 The first opportunity to create such a task force will be at the G-8 summit next month, and its first priority must be to develop new and easily-produced vaccines to deal with the outbreak. But lasting progress, as Samuel Jutzi of the UN?s Food and Agriculture Organization said at Vietnam , depends on ?addressing the transmission of the virus where it occurs, in poultry...chickens and wetland-dwelling ducks.? A hundred million Asian peasants have to be persuaded to stop living in the same space as their poultry. A tall order, but a necessary one.

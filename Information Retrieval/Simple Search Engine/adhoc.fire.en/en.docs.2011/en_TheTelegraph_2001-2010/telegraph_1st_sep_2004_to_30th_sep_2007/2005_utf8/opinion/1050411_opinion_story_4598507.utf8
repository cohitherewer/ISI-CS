 BOLD MOVE TO GO NOWHERE

 Twenty-Twenty 

Bharat Bhushan

 Engaging smile

 After eight rounds of negotiations, 

 the Naga peace talks are stalled. The leadership of the 

 National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah) suspects 

 that the governments negotiators are following a strategy 

 of trying to wear them down while imultaneously encouraging 

 rival groups to challenge them in both Nagaland and Manipur.

 There has been a spurt in the 

 incidents of sporadic violence between the NSCN(I-M) and 

 NSCN(Khaplang). The NSCN(I-M) claims that the Khaplang group 

 is deliberately provoking it and that the Indian security 

 forces are encouraging the latter to do so. It also alleges 

 that a minister in Nephieu Rio?s government is funding the 

 Naga National Council and arming it.

 In Manipur, it claims that the government is diverting food supplies meant for Naga refugees to the Meitei rebels, especially the United National Liberation Front. There are also allegations that the local government is supplying ammunition to the UNLF.

 In short, suspicions are high and the lack of progress in the peace talks is fuelling them further. The stalemate also provides grist to the mill of NSCN(I-M)?s rivals who have been accusing it of betraying the Naga cause.

 In the negotiations, there is no movement forward on defining a new political relationship between the Nagas and New Delhi based on a division of competencies; and on the integration of the Naga inhabited areas. The United Progressive Alliance government is finding it difficult to move on these issues while the NSCN(I-M) considers them central to any settlement.

 The reasons for the stalemate are obvious. Redefining the relationship with Nagaland may open up a Pandora?s box ? other states of India may make similar demands at a later stage; and the integration of the Naga areas may create problems in the adjoining states.

 The possibility of other Indian states demanding a chance to re-negotiate their federal relationship with the Centre, however, has to be weighed against the recognition by New Delhi of the ?unique history and situation? of the Nagas. Isak Swu and Thuingaleng Muivah would be well within their rights to ask that if the Naga situation was not comparable to any other in India, then why should the Naga peace process be held to ransom for the fear of the adverse reaction of other states? The government negotiators are, however, neither saying yes nor saying no to re-defining the relationship with the Nagas.

 The integration issue seems even more intractable for New Delhi ? a concession on this issue may set the neighbouring states of Nagaland on fire. It is in these states ? Manipur, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh ? where their various tribes live, that the Nagas claim territory.

 The experience of the Meiteis torching the state legislative assembly and bringing life to a standstill in the Imphal valley four years ago is still not forgotten in New Delhi. Even fresher are the images of old Meitei women disrobing themselves to protest against the alleged atrocities of the Assam Rifles.

 The stand of the Nagas, however, is that they are not claiming anyone else?s territory ? not of the Meiteis, the Kukis, the Hmars, and the Assamese nor that of the non-Naga tribes of Arunachal ? but only those areas where they have been living and farming since time immemorial. The non-acceptance of this reality, the NSCN(I-M) leaders feel, shows that New Delhi views the Naga issue not in terms of what the Nagas want but in terms of the interests of other ethnicities.

 It is not as if the Meiteis are with New Delhi. There are many armed Meitei groups that voice grievances against India. The leaders of some of these groups are based across the border in Myanmar and refuse to deal with New Delhi. In contrast to the Meitei groups, the NSCN(I-M), the largest insurgent group in the North-east, has had seven years of ceasefire with New Delhi and has consistently shown a desire to engage with it. Muivah and Swu can then legitimately wonder why sensible Indian politicians would want to worry about the insurgent leaders sitting in Myanmar instead of the NSCN leadership sitting in New Delhi and negotiating with them.

 The essential point is that there is no movement forward on the integration issue. The government negotiators have, however, promised to talk to the neighbouring states without accepting, even in principle, the legitimacy of the Naga desire to live under a single political unit. That, to the Nagas, does not even amount to accepting the legitimacy of their demand for integration, leave alone putting into motion a process to achieve that goal.

 What underlies the current stalemate is also a peculiar understanding of the Naga issue in particular and conflict resolution in general in the UPA government. The basic assumption seems to be that there is no need to consider any demand of armed insurgents to amend the framework of the Indian Constitution; they should instead be brought within its existing ambit.

 In this, the UPA government is making a bold, but regressive, departure from the approach followed by the previous governments starting from P.V. Narasimha Rao?s to Atal Bihari Vajpayee?s. The only explanation for adopting such a strategy seems to be past experience ? the pole star of all bureaucracies. So it might be argued that the Mizos, after all, had also claimed that they were a separate nation ? but did not the Mizo National Front leader, Laldenga, eventually come around to an agreement within the Indian Constitution in 1986?

 In Punjab, too, the Anandpur Sahib Resolution of 1973 talked of a Greater Punjab comprising the Punjabi speaking areas of the adjoining states of Haryana, Himachal and Rajasthan. The resolution also demanded greater federalism in terms of a truly autonomous state of Punjab. Did not New Delhi manage to resolve the tangle without conceding a Greater Punjab (akin to Naga integration) or changing the Constitution for granting the Sikhs greater autonomy? Why stop at 1973, there may be others who might argue that conceding the provision of Article 370 was a grave error and that India is paying for that ?mistake? till today.

 In short, the argument is that the Naga demands must be resisted as they fall outside the Indian Constitution and the NSCN(I-M) leaders should eventually be persuaded to see how their aspirations could be met within the exis- ting constitutional provisions. The fond hope is that Muivah would follow the example of Laldenga. 

 We are then back to square one after more than seven years of ceasefire. This could well be a recipe for ensuring the failure of the Naga peace process. A lack of political imagination combined with a bureaucratic approach is bound to send the Naga leaders back to the jungle if not on a flight back to Bangkok or Amsterdam. 

 Should this happen, the UPA government would be hard put to explain why it invited the leaders to New Delhi in the first place. If the ceasefire comes to an end or the NSCN(I-M) takes some other precipitate action, re-starting the peace process in the near future may become an uphill task. So much of running around would have been done to stay at the same place.

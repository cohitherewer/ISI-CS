 Letters to Editor

 See no evil

 Sir ? Television channels often air special bulletins on crime to bolster their TRP ratings. But the programmes also augment the crime-rate, with criminals learning newer ways of committing crimes without risking detection. The government should seek the opinion of experts on the impact of such shows on society and crime. The media should also desist from publicizing the names of defence lawyers to deny criminals easy access to them. After all, isn?t the media responsible for turning the likes of Dhananjoy Chatterjee and Nirbhay Gujjar into celebrities? 

 Yours faithfully,

 Madhu Agrawal,Dariba 

 Time to retire

 Sir ? Sourav Ganguly and Jagmohan Dalmiya have monopolized Indian cricket for far too long. Greg Chappell, after suggesting that Ganguly should sit out the first test against Zimbabwe, will now find himself on the wrong side of this formidable combination (?Sourav reveals step-down pressure, finger at Greg?, Sep 16). Ganguly has not scored runs of late except against weak teams like Bangladesh and Zimbabwe while consistent performers like Mohammed Kaif have been denied a place in the team. 

 Clearly, the choice before the selectors is between building a better team for the forthcoming world cup with a strong leader at the helm and continuing with a bunch of non-performing, arrogant, and selfish players who use weaker teams to strike form. It remains to be seen whether the selectors decide to sack Chappell after the series or take some hard decisions about the players. 

 Yours faithfully,

Harsh Mathur, Calcutta

 Sir ? Never before in the history of cricket has a player been persevered with despite failing consistently for an inordinately long period. The country?s cricketing interests are being compromised for the benefit of a single player, Sourav Ganguly. When he plays, India is effectively a player short, thanks to his form with the bat. One hopes that the selectors will set aside provincial considerations and select the best possible side for engagements in the future.

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? It has been a rather poor year for Indian cricket. But why is Sourav Ganguly being blamed for the team?s indifferent showing? It is not the captain alone, but the whole team which needs to play well to win. Unfortunately, some Indian cricketers are only interested in their place in the world rankings. And everybody seems intent on blaming the coach for the team?s pitiable showing while the real fault lies with the cricketers who have performed badly. Our cricketers need to be told that unless they get back to their winning ways, fans will switch their allegiance to India?s tennis sensation, Sania Mirza, soon enough. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arunima Mishra, Cuttack

 Sir ? Since winning the Natwest trophy three years back, the Indians have failed to win any of the 16 finals they have played in. A new coach has been appointed. Everything from yoga to management modules have been tried to motivate the players. But all this has come to nothing. Sachin Tendulkar?s absence has meant that India?s much-vaunted middle order has collapsed repeatedly. The bowlers have bowled well only in patches. But Sourav Ganguly need not worry about this. So long as Jagmohan Dalmiya is around, our selectors will not have the courage to drop him from the side. 

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Das Gupta, Calcutta

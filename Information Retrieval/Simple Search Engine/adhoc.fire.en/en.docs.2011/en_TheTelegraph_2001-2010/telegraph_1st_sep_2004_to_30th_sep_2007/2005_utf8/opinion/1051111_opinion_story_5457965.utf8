 Paperback Pickings

 Fun and war games on Grub Street

 Nehru: A political Life (Oxford, Rs 295) by Judith M. Brown is yet another attempt to tell the story of one of India?s finest statesmen. Brown is careful to mention that S. Gopal?s book remains the best biographical work on Nehru, and she has merely attempted to place the great man within a ?broader context?.Despite the scrupulous research, the book does not tell us anything new about either Nehru the politician or Nehru the man. The photographs are similar to Brown?s writing ? scholarly but uninteresting. Hardly a ?complete? biography of India?s first prime minister.

A hack?s progress (Roli, Rs 295) by 

Phillip Knightley is an outrageously funny take on the author?s life on Grub 

Street. Starting as a copy boy ? carrying handwritten or typewritten copies for 

publication from one end of the office to another ? in a little-known Australian 

paper, Knightley went on to become a reporter and did stints for different papers, 

including one on Fleet Street. From war to fake Mussolini diaries to royal visits, 

Knightley has seen them all and has written about them with a rare mix of humour, 

integrity, and courage.

 The Longest Race (Roli, Rs 250) by Tom Alter is the actor-compere -journalist-cum-author?s (in that order) third book. It is about Bahadur, son of a humble watchman, who overcomes numerous hurdles to discover fame and fortune on the tracks. Alter is a greater success as an actor than as a writer. ?As the muscles across Bahadur?s thighs tightened, and his feet began to ache,...the joy of running became something to strive for...? does not exactly make for exciting reading.

 The order of light (Penguin, Rs 250) by Haroon Moghul is the story of a young Pakistani-American and his Indian friend who travel to Cairo to study the Qur?an. But soon, the protagonist?s spiritual lethargy forces him to flee the drudgery of daily prayers and sermons to the winding streets of old Cairo. Here, he comes across the members of a mysterious order in a tiny, dilapidated mosque, who have travelled back in time to save the world from a terrible end and whose teachings force the young man to look at his faith in a new light. Part sci-fi, part adventure, Moghul?s book, written in a racy, frenzied style, would make the reader keep turning the pages.

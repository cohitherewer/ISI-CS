 Letters to Editor

 Cat fight

 Sir ? ?Environmentalist Vs Environmentalist? (Aug 14), which pitted two opposing environmentalists against each other made for interesting reading. However, the views of Sunita Narain, director of the Centre for Science and Environment, is a bit bizarre. Can men and cats ever co-exist, and that too peacefully? As a member of a family residing in the South 24 Parganas (which houses the Sundarbans) over several generations, I grew up amid an oral history that speaks of man?s triumph over tigers. The demographic history of the district for the last century is essentially a story of clearing jungles, killing tigers ? and more importantly, creating a situation where the animals cannot survive ? to make way for human habitation. We have read about tigers being sighted in Chowringhee or Kidderpore a century back. Even two decades ago, Biren Roy Road, West was dotted with shrines of Dakkhinrai, the tiger god. They are all gone now. Narain?s pro-tribal stand, and call for pragmatism in the ?Indian situation? is only a euphemism for the lack of will to save the big cat.

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Pal, Batanagar

 Sir ? The ?Insight? article (?Environmentalist Vs Environmentalist?) shows how so-called experts and conservationists are haggling over ways to protect the tiger. The tiger, however, will not wait for anybody. If those entrusted with the responsibility of sorting a critical environmental problem fail to resolve their differences soon, we will not see the beasts any more. The experts, expectedly, will then move on to the blame game.

 Though I support Sunita Narain on various environmental issues published in her magazine, this time at least, I would rather be on the side of Valmik Thapar. The core areas of the forests must be freed of all human habitations and encroachments if the tiger is to survive. Once the tribals are given inalienable rights to the jungle, one can rest assured that it will not be long before the forests, including the core areas, vanish. Tribals will start cultivation, then they will demand roads, electricity, canals, houses and mining rights, and the politicians, least bothered about the welfare of the tiger, will comply only too happily. If the tribals had truly been able to protect the tiger, the Sariska tragedy would not have occurred. The man-tiger conflict in the Sundarbans is sufficient evidence that the protection of the tiger is impossible to synchronize with human interests. If the tiger is to be saved, priority must be given to the tiger alone. 

 Yours faithfully,

Nelson A. Petrie, Siliguri

 Sir ? At last we have a pragmatic approach to tiger conservation from the prime minister-appointed tiger task force, which wants tribals to co-exist with tigers. Unless the Sunita Narain-line is toed, we might soon see vanishing forests together with vanishing tigers. I hope good sense prevails ultimately, and the prime minister is able to see the logic behind what Narain is saying. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sanjay Ray, Calcutta

 Sir ? We have two different viewpoints on tiger conservation ? one that wants tigers to cohabit with people and another that wants them to live alone. From the look of things, it seems that Sunita Narain will carry the day, much to the discomfiture of rival environmentalists like Valmik Thapar, who will refuse to comply and thus precipitate another stalemate. But even before this stalemate occurs, one wonders if Narain will make much headway with her cohabitation plan. Nothing specific has been spelt out, besides a loose argument that has already been stated several times before (the Insight article notes that). The Narain plan of action will help pass the pending tribal bill, which probably explains the government?s interest in it. But if that happens, we will have not merely an incommunicado Thapar. The tribals will also have to contend with a disinterested, and worse, an ominously disruptive, forest department which has been crying hoarse over the ministry of tribal welfare poaching on its territory with the tribal bill. Can the tribals, and more importantly, tigers survive all this?

 Yours faithfully,

M. Chatterjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? There is no doubt that the tiger problem can no longer be viewed in the pristine isolation that Valmik Thapar and his group would have it viewed. Man, and not merely tribals, have moved irremovably close to the animals. And this is evident not only in lands marked out as tiger preserves, like Sariska. It is also true in the case of expanding cities like Mumbai. A fine balance has to be worked out, and the first step towards the safekeeping of the big animals is to keep big egos out. 

 Yours faithfully,

J. Shankar, Mumbai

 Parting shot

 Sir ? The report ?Guess where: Haryana or Heathrow?? (Aug 13) once again highlighted the nuisance potential of Indians. What an admirable feat these ingenious people achieved at the cost of India?s reputation. They managed to stall 500 flights and leave thousands of passengers stranded, leaving the British air reverberating with their cry of ?Jai Hind?, once Subhas Bose?s famous freedom call. If Bose were alive today, he would have had second thoughts about the necessity of liberating his countrymen from the British yoke.

 Yours faithfully,

 Surajit Das, Calcutta

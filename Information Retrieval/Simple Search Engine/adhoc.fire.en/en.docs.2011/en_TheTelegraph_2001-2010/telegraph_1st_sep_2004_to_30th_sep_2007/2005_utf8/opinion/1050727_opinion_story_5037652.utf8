 RIGHTS ISSUE

 Violence precludes any discussion based on principles. The police action against agitating workers in Gurgaon will forever cloud any discussion on the basic issues involved. Reports from the site do suggest that the police acted in a manner far in excess of what the situation actually warranted. This may be a reflection of the fact that the police in Haryana have never really encountered any kind of labour unrest. The response of the police in Mumbai or Calcutta in a similar situation would probably have been a little more tempered. There might have been an element of revenge in the actions of the police since a senior police officer had been the target of mob violence when the striking workers had blockaded a section of the Delhi-Jaipur highway, one of the major arteries in the country. This is not to condone police excesses, but only to set the incident in a context and to underline the fact that the workers probably cast the first stone. Such is the distortion in perspective created by the enormity of the police action that the actual fact of the initiation of the violence might be lost in the charged emotional atmosphere which now dominates any discourse on the incident.

 In India, all discussion on labour-related violence proceed from the premise that agitating workers can never be wrong. Such an assumption is unwarranted, as is the opposite one which holds that the management or the police is always right. In Gurgaon, the workers of the automobile company who were demonstrating did not belong to a registered trade union. Even before a debate can take place on the legitimacy of their demands and grievances, it needs to be recognized that workers do not have the right to inconvenience people totally unconnected with their factory and their agitation. The workers of the Gurgaon-based company did precisely this when they created a blockade on a national highway. Police intervention to break this blockade snowballed into the violence that occurred on Monday. The protests of the workers had been peaceful and low key before the blockade, the police action against it, and the cycle of violence that came in its trail. Gurgaon is a new industrial hub in north India; neither management nor labour can afford to alienate investment from the area. Irresponsibility, on the part of workers and on the part of the police, can only have an adverse effect on Gurgaon?s future. The incident thus has important lessons. The most important of these is the need for labour reforms. But the chances are that this lesson will be lost in the howls of protest against the exaggerated police response.

 EASTERN DISTURBANCES

 Both the Centre and the Assam government are turning a blind eye to the collaboration between ULFA and the ISI, writes Sumanta Sen

 Look beyond the obvious

 Even as hopes were being created from several quarters of normalization of ties with Pakistan, came news of the United Liberation Front of Asom owning hotels and nursing homes in Dhaka and elsewhere in Bangladesh. The news came from a senior Border Security Force officer who provided details about such establishments. The only question that remained unanswered was, where did the ULFA get the money from? That question will perhaps remain unanswered, as the money could have come from only one source, namely the Inter-Services Intelligence of Pakistan. But in these days of bonhomie, nobody in New Delhi is speaking of the ISI any more. 

 Yet, the ISI continues to exist and function. The Centre knows it, as do the state governments in the North-east, particularly Assam and Tripura. It is no secret that the ULFA and the National Liberation Front of Tripura cadre are flush with funds provided by the ISI at contact points in Bangladesh. It is also widely believed that the ISI is seeking to flood this country with counterfeit notes, the entry points being again the north-eastern states and West Bengal.

 Yet, where is the concern in New Delhi? In the capital, all attention is focussed on Kashmir, or on the efficacy of confidence-building measures. Pakistan, on the other hand, is seemingly playing the game both ways, playing up to India in the ?common quest for peace? and needling it in the east and the north-east. And it is having no problems in this, since Bangladesh, from the time of Ziaur Rahman, has been a happy collaborator.

 Now there are moves to hold negotiations with the ULFA, and the Centre is reportedly ?mulling? the outfit?s demand that all its members be released before negotiations are held. Naturally, the Assam government has not reacted to the BSF report about the ULFA establishments in Bangladesh. For reasons best known to the state, the question of who is funding the ULFA has been ignored. Instead, it is being pointed out that the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah) also owns property in Thailand. Yet, it is the identity of the people who are funding such bodies, which is crucial to the issue of peace in the country.

 It is the Congress which is in office both at Guwahati and New Delhi. The Tarun Gogoi administration in Guwahati has perhaps been warned to tread softly where the ULFA is concerned. But has the state wanted to know what would be the basis of the talks and what, if anything, would be achieved by these? Such questions had been raised by Hiteswar Saikia when Rajiv Gandhi decided to hold talks with the All Assam Students Union. At that time, he was ignored by his leader. As a consequence of the ?agreement? that the late prime minister signed with the student agitators, the Congress lost the elections and Assam was thrown into an even greater confusion when the Asom Gana Parishad assumed office. Gogoi was a witness to all that and cannot be expected to repeat the ?mistake? that Saikia had committed.

 An invitation to talks imparts some legitimacy to a secessionist outfit. But what can be the result of such talks? These outfits should be treated solely as a law and order problem. Surely nobody will buy the argument that even with all its might, the Centre cannot effectively deal with it. The problem is that political parties in India have always believed in patching up secret deals with troublemakers to gain political mileage later. Rajiv Gandhi had tried this with the AASU. The ploy failed, and now there seems to be an attempt to play the same game with the ULFA. In the meantime, Pakistan has got the ULFA exactly where it wants.

 On the subject of talks, with what end in mind are the negotiations dragging on with the NSCN(I-M)? Will the Centre agree to such demands as Greater Nagaland, greater federalism and agreement outside the purview of the Constitution? Yet, the rebel Nagas have made it clear that they are not prepared to give up any of the demands and have even threatened to end the ceasefire. Does the Centre believe that there is really a groundswell of support for the rebels and that breaking off the talks will lead to a major confrontation? In that case, why prolong the talks, surrender to the NSCN?s demands and then be prepared to face the consequences in the other states of the region. 

 Now, if the threat of disturbances is not to be kept dangling over Nagaland, then the Centre would do well to muster courage and take some hard decisions. The tactics of dragging the talks and hoping the other side would break down may not only flop, it may be providing the rebels with an opportunity to quietly shore up their strength.

 What is good for the Nagas, of course, is not applicable to the Assamese. Nagas may wonder at the term ?secession? as they have reasons to believe that they had been forced into an union with an alien culture. That is not true of the Assamese, their Mongoloid features notwithstanding. History also shows that the ULFA agitation had been triggered off and sustained by outside help, while the Naga uprising was born out of the soil. The first task should be to mount pressure to have the ULFA?s supply line cut off. This would also make similar outfits in Tripura and Manipur go on the run. The ISI could be mentioned to the general in Islamabad in a way that will make his patrons in Washington uneasy. Talks with the ULFA can be held only on New Delhi?s terms which will be possible if the latter have nowhere to turn. The Centre must tell Pakistan that it is aware of what is happening across other borders as well. The Delhi-based media should also get rid of the mindset that illegal immigration is the only problem faced by states along the Bangladesh border. Ever since the Seventies, the media in the capital has seen the agitators in Assam as satyagrahis and this has not helped either the state or the nation as a whole.

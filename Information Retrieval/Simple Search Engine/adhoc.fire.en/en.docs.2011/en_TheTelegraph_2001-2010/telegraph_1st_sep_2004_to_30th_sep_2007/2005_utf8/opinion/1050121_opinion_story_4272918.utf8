 FACES BEHIND THE VEILS

Gender, Politics and Islam 

Edited by Therese Saliba, Carolyn Allen and Judith A. Howard, 

Orient Longman, Rs 350

Gender, Politics and Islam is about women in 

Islamic countries and how they are coming to terms with their religious culture. 

With feminism becoming the order of the day, gender politics have brought to centrestage 

the Islamic women and how Westerners are trying to liberate them from age-old 

traditions that they think have kept the women far removed from modern life. The 

book also illustrates how the West is responding to a religious group it, till 

recently, considered an enemy to its culture. 

 There are ten essays in the book, including the introduction, and except for two, all are written by women from the West and the Middle East. The essays demonstrate that Islam is not as rigid a religion as it is generally thought to be and its womenfolk, veiled or otherwise, are not passive victims of circumstances. They are trying to seek answers to their problems rather than getting influenced by Western ideas and thoughts. Besides, the essays tell that Islam and its traditions are a combination of intricacies that can be modified with the times despite being moulded by regions, cultures, classes and even the economic conditions of the places where they are practised. 

 In writing about women of Bangladesh, Canada, Egypt, Iran, Israel, Pakistan, Yemen and Palestine ? how they are trying to cope with their lives in their own bounded spheres and striving to enjoy legal, political, social and economic rights ? the editors have strangely left out the women in India. Contributors include Therese Saliba, Valentine M. Moghadam, Anouar Majid, Mary Elaine Hegland, Julie Peteet, Gabriele von Bruck, Elora Shehabuddin, S.M. Shamsul Alam, Amal Amireh and Shahnaz Khan. Some of the essayists focus on the importance of Islam as a force that determines the women?s lives. There are essays on Yemeni women, fatwas in Bangladesh, Taslima Nasreen, Arab feminism, as well as on the minority Shia sect of Pakistan. If Moghadam is in favour of keeping the mosque and the state separate and wishes reform to come from within the community, Hegland talks about sectarian violence in Pakistan and wants Shia women to play an active role. From the Arabian struggle for freedom to bourgeois democracy, imperialism and Islamic orthodoxy, these contributors have explored all avenues to highlight Islamic feminism. 

 Though dealing primarily with women, some of the issues taken up are serious ones and require reflection and dispassionate solutions.

 AFTER NATURE

 It is not enough to say that children are the worst victims of the tsunami. They are the worst victims in many more ways than the obvious ones. Events are proving that there is no dearth of predators who fatten on vulnerability of all kinds. Children have been sexually molested, raped and kidnapped in Thailand and Sri Lanka during unsupervised rescue operations and while they were in temporary shelters. The other vulnerable segment comprises orphaned women, who are in any case always the inevitable target at times of crisis and institutional breakdown. There were some features in the tsunami-induced crisis that proved particularly beneficial to the human predators. The scale of the devastation was unprecedented, and the frantic search for survivors that followed continued for days. The near-impossibility of accounting for every one of the thousands of human beings affected in the rural hamlets and fishing communities around the Bay of Bengal was the biggest advantage. No one can say how many children there were in one region: it will be difficult to know how many have been swept away and how many quietly picked up and taken away. This is an especially frightening fact in countries like Indonesia, Thailand, Sri Lanka and India, for in this area the trafficking of children and young girls is a thriving trade enjoying global demand. Being raped or sexually molested is one type of horror added to the desolation and trauma caused by the tsunami, being picked up and sold off is another.

 There is yet another kind of exploitation that has been reported from Sri Lanka. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam had specialized in a child army, for which they recruited children, especially orphans. Although things have been quieter during the three-year ceasefire, some cases of such recruitment have been heard of again. The extremists, who were themselves hit badly by the tsunami, have been warned to keep off the survivor shelters. There is some irony in this: an appeal to ruthless militants to lay off children. Yet this is different from the deeds of the sexual predators. There is something monstrous about the enjoyment of destroying already-destroyed children while the region lies in ruins around them, and in getting rich by selling such children into slavery and the sex industry. These predators are an unrecognizable breed of humans.

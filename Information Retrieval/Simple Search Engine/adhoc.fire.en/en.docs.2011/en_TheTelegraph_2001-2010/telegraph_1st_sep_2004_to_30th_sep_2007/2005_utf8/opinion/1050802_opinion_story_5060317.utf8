 DOUBLE STANDARDS

 Why is it that one Japanese MNC clamps down on unions in Gurgaon while another welcomes them in Canada? asks Jay Bhattacharjee

 Salutary lessons

 The recent events in Gurgaon, where violent clashes erupted between the workers of a Japanese factory and a typically brutal and venal Indian police posse, brought to the fore crucial issues about the operational norms of foreign companies in India. Many Indians must have been distressed to see the television coverage of the violence unleashed by the Haryana police on unarmed workers, who were asserting their right to demonstrate against the plant management which had declared a lockout.

 The reported reaction of the Japanese ambassador immediately after the incident was surprising. Usually, diplomats from the land of the rising sun are far more reticent in their comportment. However, the conduct of the Indian elite and the governing classes do strange things to foreigners who are otherwise scrupulous about observing behavioural codes. In this case, the shrill outcry from the usual band of industry and business chambers must have comforted the Japanese embassy. Most of these spokespersons loudly lamented the possible negative impact of the events in Haryana on future foreign direct investment into India.

 Under the circumstances, it becomes necessary to study the variables that direct and influence FDI in the international arena. In the last decade, there has been a large body of research on this subject by many think tanks and agencies. While the analysts and scholars are not absolutely unanimous in their conclusions, there is extensive convergence of opinion. The fundamental consensus is that good governance and effective public services are also good for business. International boardrooms and corporate leaders, key players in deciding the flow of investment funds to foreign countries, now accept this as a broad tenet and guideline.

 Gone are the days when American, European and Japanese FDI flowed into countries in south America and Africa that were governed by crony regimes, with repressive labour laws and non-democratic political structures. Apartheid-dominated South Africa and banana republics or junta regimes like Bolivia, Paraguay, Chile and Brazil were favourite destinations of multinational investment from the West and Japan from the Sixties to the Eighties. The entire scenario, thereafter, underwent a sea change and MNC managements had to take this transformation into account.

 A recent event involving Toyota, a Japanese company of the same stature as Honda, is well worth studying. For the last year or so, the United States of America and Canada had been competing fiercely for a new Toyota car factory. The contenders were several states in southern US and the Canadian province of Ontario. Some of the American provinces were reported to have offered Toyota financial incentives running into hundreds of millions of dollars. Socially backward states like Alabama also emphasized their low unionization rate in order to impress the Toyota bosses in Japan.

 However, last month, the Japanese auto giant surprised the Americans and delighted their northern neighbours by choosing to invest in Ontario. This, despite the fact that Ontario is a completely unionized location and Canada has a taxation regime higher than the US?s. Thus Toyota sent out the message that unionization was not an issue ? what matters to it is the social fabric of the country that will give better returns for its investment in the medium term through higher productivity and harmonious labour-management relations. The Harvard don, Paul Krugman, in his trenchant observations on this development, emphasized that it is ?the American system, which penalises companies that treat their workers well, that?s in trouble?.

 Why is it, then, that Japanese MNCs operating in India can blithely press for a non-unionized labour force and declare an illegal lock-out when workers want to press for a wage increase? Worse, how is that the country?s accredited envoy to India steps dangerously close to the red line and makes observations that border on meddling in India?s internal affairs?

 All this is related to our own policy meanderings. Despite cosmetic (and comic) expressions of outrage from a variety of political leaders following the mayhem in Haryana, the reality is that we in India have not yet mapped out a transition path from a licence-raj, state-capitalist economy to a genuine market-driven, social democratic framework. The left in India has been an also-ran for many years and is now reduced to a motley crowd hanging on to the Congress bandwagon. Its brazen alliance with business in its bailiwick of West Bengal makes it an uneasy spokesperson for workers? rights at the national level.

 The Congress and the saffron parties have no cogent stand on a market economy, where all stakeholders have effective protection through independent regulators. This, in essence, is what characterizes a modern, democratic market-economy. It is the Nordic model of development that India should be looking at, rather than the Anglo-Saxon paradigm. Interestingly, international FDI flows (controlled by hardcore capitalist corporate managers) are increasingly being influenced by this logic rather than the strident 19th-century rhetoric of their Indian camp followers.

 If one looks at FDI inflows into the major west European countries, the contrast between the United Kingdom ? the current darling of the neo-conservative cheer leaders ? and France ? a supposedly comatose welfare economy ? cannot be more surprising. Conventional wisdom dictates that Tony Blair?s Britain is the runaway favourite and winner. The opposite is the case. According to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, productivity in France ? gross domestic product per hour worked ? is actually a bit higher than that in the US and considerably higher than in Britain.

 The flow of FDI into France and the country?s overall rank in the scorecard of the 10 major European economies, from the perspective of international investors, are also higher than those of Britain. So is the amount of social security contribution as percentage of total labour cost. In other words, the country that has a distinctly higher rate of social security payments is also the favourite destination for FDI. This apparent contradiction is, of course, explained by the higher productivity of labour, as has been stated earlier. As Krugman has remarked in another context, ?treating people decently is sometimes a competitive advantage?.

 The think tanks in Indian business associations as well as in the government would do well to study the illuminating report titled, ?Attractiveness of France ? Scoreboard? (Invest in France Agency, June 2005). Admittedly, it is published by an organization of the French government whose mandate is to promote the country as a destination for FDI. However, we are not talking of a body like the Yojana Bhavan, the Central Statistical Organization or some other Indian government number-cruncher, whose data is revised every now and then and whose reliability has never been kosher. In any case, cross-country data in Europe and North America is always subject to very close scrutiny. If one country tries to pull off a fast one, it is immediately brought down to earth.

 Treating workers decently means recognizing their right to collective action and unionization. Japanese MNCs cannot gladly accept a certain set of norms in North America and insist on significantly lower standards in India.

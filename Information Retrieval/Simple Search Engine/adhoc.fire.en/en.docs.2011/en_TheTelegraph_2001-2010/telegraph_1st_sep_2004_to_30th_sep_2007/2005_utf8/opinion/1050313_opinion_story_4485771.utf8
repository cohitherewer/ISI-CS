 DIARY

 A rare exchange on a rare occasion. Since the parliament now habitually descends into chaos at the first sign of disagreement, it was indeed a treat to see MPs sitting quietly in the Rajya Sabha last Wednesday as Jaswant Singh got up to initiate the debate on the president?s address. For the ruling party, what followed wasn?t exactly music. Singh alleged that ?where there is competence, there is no political authority? and ?where there is political authority, there is no competence?. The hint was the size of an atom bomb, and it didn?t miss its target. Even then, the peace held in parliament, except for a brief interlude. It came from the Congress MP from Mumbai, Murli Deora. But the indomitable Singh continued, making light of Deora?s intervention as one from ?Our member from Manhattan?. The reference was to the Congress leader?s close friendship with the former New York congressman, Stephen Solarz. Deora, however, could not be snubbed so easily. He shot back, ?And you are our member from Washington?, referring to the close ties Singh had once formed with the US president?s pointsman for south Asia, Strobe Talbott. Tit for tat, or Talbott?

 The Lals seem to have staged a noisy comeback in Haryana. Bhajan Lal may have missed the bus, but his son, Chandra Mohan, nicknamed CM, is a minister. Bansi Lal?s son, Surinder, too, has bagged a berth and so has SS Surjewala?s son, Randeep. While having his cake, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, under the able guidance of 10 Janpath, took extra care to pack the council of ministers with other hopefuls. Those who failed to make it even knew what to expect. The day before the cabinet expansion, the AICC gen-sec in charge of Haryana, Janardhan Dwivedi, had a pocket-size Gita selectively distributed among members. It was upto the recipients to read between the lines.

 Another native talent from Andhra, but she specializes in verbal volley, mostly. We are talking of the tourism minister, Renuka Chaudhuri, who is supposed to have lambasted a senior journalist on the telephone recently for writing about the liquor scandal brewing in her ministry. The man was apparently asked why he should be so bothered about some alcohol brands disappearing from ITDC shops and whether he wished to have a crate of liquor delivered to him. When the journo swore that he was a teetotaller and never had anything stronger than a glass of nimbu pani, there was more colourful language from the other end of the line, and this time against the entire community of scribes. Journalists, the minister insisted she knew, were willing to sell themselves for a ?bottle of tharra?. Non-plussed, the journo is supposed to have asked the minister to take up her complaint with the editors. 

 Does the FM have a heart of gold? The CPI(M), once quite anti-P Chidambaram, may now nod in agreement. The change of heart seems to have been prompted by PC?s softening of his stand on the proposed two per cent excise duty on premium branded jewellery and his dealing with a particular left MP whose job it was to sort the matter out. PC?s initial response to the phone call from the MP had been angry. He quietened down when the MP tried to reason. PC promised to look into the matter, and, voila, he did. Our good Samaritan MP was immediately off to Delhi, but not without first letting the party office know about PC?s goodness.

 It was Rahul Gandhi and his young brigade who brought back parliamentarians to the house, but it is Ghulam Nabi Azad who is having the last laugh. Under the scanner for his alleged proximity to actress Nagma and for the national award given to his wife, Azad is now taking all the credit for having fielded Rahul to ?force? the BJP to return to Parliament. In the Congress, Azad?s contention has few takers, but since it is about Rahul, no one is willing to disagree, at least on the face of it.

 The cracking of the Roma Jhawar case has created a curious dilemma for the Calcutta police. Kidnappers have reverted back to local booths to post their ransom calls. Which means the money invested in the sophisticated technology to intercept mobile calls will now go down the drain. 

 Shibu Soren may not have seen it coming, but apparently the Congress managers did. In fact, a report seems to have reached 10 Janpath, detailing how Soren had cavalierly let go of the trump cards ? independent MLAs that is ? which had been painfully collected for him to get the Jharkhand taj. One independent who had been wooed to Soren?s house is said to have left on the pretext of answering nature?s call. When guruji was asked why he was allowed to go, he supposedly explained that some tribals felt more comfortable in the open, lush green surroundings. Another independent, Enos Ekka, boarded a helicopter, which he said he had mistaken for being RK Anand?s, and landed on BJP turf with aplomb. When the Congress team sought an explanation from the then supremely confident Soren, he apparently said, ?Arre bhai, ek Ekka se kya hota hai. Mere pass poori tash ki gaddi hai?. Someone should have pointed out to him that his pack was there alright, but minus the aces.

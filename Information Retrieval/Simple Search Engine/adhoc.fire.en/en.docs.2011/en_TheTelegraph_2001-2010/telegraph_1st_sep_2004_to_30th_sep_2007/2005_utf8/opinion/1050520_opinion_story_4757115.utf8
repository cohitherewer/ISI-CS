 - Anatomy of love and possession

 Casanova: scallywag hero

 Conversations in bolzano 

 By S?ndor M?rai, 

 Viking, ? 10.50 

 The author means what he says in the title. The novel grows and moves only through conversations in the town of Bolzano. This is where S?ndor M?rai imagines his hero, the 18th-century adventurer, Giacomo Casanova, to have paused for a few days during the winter of 1756, on his way to Munich after his historical escape from the terrible prison in Venice, nicknamed the Leads. The memory of the sixteen-month-long incarceration is like an angry scar on Casanova?s soul: he is the lover of life and light, and this is the cruellest punishment that could have been inflicted on him by unknown enemies. M?rai was one of Hungary?s leading novelists before World War II, although this is only the second of his many novels to have been translated into English. The first to be translated was Embers, the tale of a tense and mysterious encounter between two friends after forty years of waiting, in which the woman who determines their relationship is absent. 

 But no one is absent in Conversations in Bolzano, translated by George Szirtes. The pattern is broadly similar to the earlier novel?s ? two men and a woman, a decisive confrontation in the past, one man waiting for the other with inscrutable patience, and two final, climactic meetings in which nothing is closed, nothing concluded. The three main actors, Casanova, the Duke of Parma, and Francesca, the duchess, are all present ? Casanova throughout, and the others in a star appearance each. There are many characters who surround the moody, brilliant, indecisive, feckless hero ? Balbi, the unfrocked priest and Casanova?s companion and helper in his escape; Giuseppe, the informative barber; Mensch, the wily moneylender; Teresa, the hotel-keeper?s ?niece?, maid-of-all-work and plaything, with her gravely innocent acceptance of his advances and her rejection of a splendid life in Munich. Only one man never appears: Signor Bragadin, a Venetian nobleman and politician. Yet without his unconditional affection and unlimited generosity Casanova would have been stranded many times over. Bragadin comes to life at the tip of Casanova?s pen, when the glamorous fugitive needs money for fine clothes, cards and onward passage, and lingers in Casanova?s mystified recollection and in the reader?s (?Why does he tolerate me? Why does he forgive my misdemeanours??), alive in his distant, selfless compassion and patient wisdom. For Casanova, the ideal of goodness belongs to ?a different world?, at which he can gaze from a distance. 

 But that is in keeping with the arrangement of the narrative. The characters clustered around the central action ? if three intense conversations in a room can be called action ? are richly depicted types. They inhabit a talkative, posturing, transactional world crisscrossed with skeins of conflicting motives and desires, a world which loves, hates, glorifies and tempts Casanova. There is no place in it for unmoved goodness. Casanova?s world is colourful, with bright lights and deep glooms, vivid interiors and alluring or sinister landscapes and townscapes. M?rai?s detailing of 18th-century Italy ? of the garden in Pistoia and the streets in Bolzano, the dresses and speech of the people who crowd into Casanova?s room when he briefly takes up counselling as a profession ? is done with loving care and engagement. This world is not just a picture, it reverberates with the unheard laughter of joy at the news of Casanova?s escape, becomes restless, daring and disorderly under the influence of his romantic personality. In an uncanny anticipation of magic realism, a map of places and classes unfolds itself in response to Casanova?s spreading fame. The most important place in it is occupied by Venice. It is the exotic, unforgiving, bloodthirsty, sexually rapacious Venice of tradition and of Casanova?s passion. As it throbs into life in conversation, the literature and history that M?rai draws from also come alive.

 Embedded within all this is the taut drama of three people, the long-delayed aftermath of a midnight duel in Pistoia. They are locked in their own immovable natures, and their destiny must be worked out in conjunction with one another. In the process, M?rai lays bare the anatomy of love, jealousy, possession and loss. As in Embers, it is impossible to be certain who betrays whom in the last analysis. It is a novel of psychologies, and of human intractability. M?rai says that he merely takes the incident of Casanova?s escape from the ?infamous Memoirs?. The rest he imagines, in order to explore a ?romantic character?; he is uninterested in the ?romantic episodes?.

 The novel is anything but episodic. It is arranged luxuriously, like a well-plotted game, with a challenge as its climax. The victories are unexpected, if the defeats can be unequivocally understood as defeats. The pairing of the nobleman and the scallywag hero may seem romantic, but M?rai?s exploration of the romantic character unearths layers of irony and ambiguity. The Duke?s fierce love of order is matched by Casanova?s terror of dullness, but this predictable opposition has the most unexpected outcome. Yet the secret of power lies with the women, in their passion and ability to see hard truths. The inversion of roles in the last encounter, under the pretext of a fancy-dress entertainment, reverses the meaning of seduction and the notion of the romantic. Extravagantly mannered, the novel is inevitably, sometimes intolerably, slow, yet no other pace could have suited this ironic savouring of human follies in the game of love and the ego.

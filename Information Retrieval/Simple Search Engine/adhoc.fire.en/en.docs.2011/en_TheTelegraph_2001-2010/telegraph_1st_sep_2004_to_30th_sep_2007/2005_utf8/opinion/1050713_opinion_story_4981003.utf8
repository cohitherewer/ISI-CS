 LIVES AND LINES

 Ethnic politics can both unite and divide people. If a state has a complex ethnic mix like Manipur?s, demographic issues can throw up complicated scenarios. The latest violence in Manipur will thus be viewed differently by the two major ethnic groups in the state ? the Meiteis and the Nagas. The blockade of two highways, which are Manipur?s economic lifeline, is the Naga response to the Meiteis? concern for the ?integrity? of the state. The Meiteis, clearly the majority group in the state, do not want the Naga-inhabited areas to be taken away from the state and added to Nagaland. But various Naga groups in Manipur see the issue differently. It is obvious that their perception is influenced by the Naga militant groups? demand for the ?integration of all Naga-inhabited areas? in a Greater Nagaland. Thus, the Meitei view of Manipur?s ?integrity? is in conflict with the Nagas? idea of ?integration? of their homeland. The problem is that the boundaries of not only Nagaland and Manipur but also those of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh will have to be redrawn if the Naga demand is to be met. Apart from the administrative difficulties, any reorganization of the states on such lines could worsen the ethnic tensions in the North-east. 

 But the violence in Manipur also shows up an insensitive administration. The Naga students? blockade of the highways turned violent after one of their colleagues was shot at and another beaten up by two securitymen. And the chief minister, Mr Okram Ibobi Singh, admitted that the securitymen had been drunk. The authorities promptly suspended and jailed the two guilty men in uniform, which might help ease the tensions. But the government needs to look deeper into such administrative lapses. Clearly, there is not enough coordination among different agencies involved in tackling the crisis. Also, Mr Singh must find ways to stop agitators from blocking the highways because this makes the common people suffer most. New Delhi and Imphal must move together to save Manipur from drifting into a worse mess.

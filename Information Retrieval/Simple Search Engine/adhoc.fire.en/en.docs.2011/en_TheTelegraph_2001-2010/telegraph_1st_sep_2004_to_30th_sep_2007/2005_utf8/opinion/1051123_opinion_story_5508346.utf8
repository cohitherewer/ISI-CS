 EC WINS

 The real victor of the elections in Bihar is not a political party or formation. The laurels belong to the Election Commission for concluding, without too many hiccups, an election process that lasted for nearly a month. The point is important because the elections were held in Bihar, the badlands of India where, as the old joke goes, the state had withered away. All previous elections in Bihar witnessed death and bloodshed. There was inevitably a smell of gunpowder in the air and, in the course of the elections, accounts surfaced of intimidation and booth capturing. Dominant castes stopped others from casting their ballots. This was part of Bihar rsquo;s terrible record which led to many people believing that democracy in the state had been reduced to a mockery of itself. But this election will remove that stigma. The EC has proved that even in Bihar it is possible for people to vote without fear. It was by far the most peaceful election Bihar has seen in recent memory

 The long election schedule had its share of criticism but in retrospect, perhaps, it was necessary to maintain peace through a proper deployment of security forces. The only thing that sullied the EC?s record this time was the low turnout. This could be a result of the well-known phenomenon of dominant groups stopping the lower castes from getting to the booth. It could also be a result of incredulity. The lower castes failed to grasp that this time they would be able to vote without being terrorized. The low turnout is a reminder that the process of cleansing the electoral system in Bihar remains an incomplete one. But this should not take away from the splendid achievements of the EC. It took the help of the available technology to stop rigging and double voting. An effort was made, worth following in other states, of minimizing the involvement of state government officials in the election process. Everybody who cares for Indian democracy should be pleased with what the EC has accomplished in Bihar.

 COMMUNITY AND THE INDIVIDUAL

 Telling Lives in India: Biography, Autobio- graphy and Life History Edited 

 by David Arnold and Stuart Blackburn,

 Permanent Black, Rs 695

 Life histories have been a ?historically persistent and socially pervasive form of cultural expression in the subcontinent?. Yet, the editors of this volume feel that they have seldom been an object of study in India. Moreover, India is frequently imagined as a society where ties of caste, kinship and religion swamp the possibility of individual agency. That is an approach the book sets out to counter.

 Telling Lives in India grew out of a project of the School of Oriental and African Studies, London. It has eleven essays, which problematize the dichotomy between community and the individual; they construct India as a site of negotiation between the two.

 David Arnold?s ?The self and the cell? examines several prison narratives written by Gandhi, Nehru, M.N. Roy, Jogesh Chandra Chatterji, V.D. Savarkar and C.R. Rajagopalachari. The prison provided an important impetus to the development of the autobiography in India, Arnold contends. He argues that Gandhi?s traumatic experiences of imprisonment in South Africa forced him to rethink questions of identity, untouchability and discipline and provided a model of how Indian society could be purged of some of its most undesirable practices. 

 Francesca Orsini?s ?The reticent autobiographer? focuses on a contradiction in the writings of Mahadevi Varma. While Varma pioneered the genre of the life sketch and wrote other people?s life stories, her writings are characterized by a marked reluctance to speak about herself. Orsini explores how Varma neutralizes the ?exposure? that poetic subjectivity seems to entail while exploiting its expressive possibilities. She also argues that Varma?s life sketches provide a more direct source for understanding her life than do her poems or essays.

 Sudipta Kaviraj?s essay on Sibnath Sastri?s Atmacharit explores Sastri?s notions of conjugality and domesticity and reads the book as a ?chronicle of the unremitting struggles of a man trying to live a private life in a society that does not yet recognize such an idea?. Atmacharit is about the invention of a private life of the individual, an essential part of the invention of a modern self.

 Sylvia Vatuk?s essay on Zakira Ghouse?s Hamara Daur-i Hayat is a fascinating read, as is David Shulman?s essay on the Sanskrit biography of Ananda Ranga Pillai. Vatuk offers a gendered reading of Ghouse and displays an understanding of the censorship that shapes autobiographies of women. The same issue surfaces again in Kirin Narayan?s essay on life stories of women in Kangra. Telling Lives in India is recommended for those interested in cultural studies.

 NOT A STATE

 A reiteration of the obvious is always a sign of prevailing confusion. It is surprising that the Supreme Court, an institution hard-pressed for time, had deliberated and decided whether the Board of Control for Cricket in India constituted a ?state? or not. It decided that BCCI could not be considered a state. The matter is elementary if arguments are followed from first principles. The state of India and its various institutions have been created by the will of the people of India. The state of India exists and enjoys its powers because it embodies the will of the people. Thus the famous declaration: vox populi, vox dei. The people represent the ultimate court of appeal in a democracy and their voice is thus like the voice of god. Following from this, it follows axiomatically that BCCI cannot be considered a state since it is a voluntary association formed by like-minded people. The apex court also made the point that there is no evidence that the state exercises pervasive control over the affairs of BCCI. The Supreme Court, in fact, underlined the autonomy of BCCI.

 The existence of the phrase ?other authorities within the territory of India?? in Article 12 of the Constitution opened up the possibility of including BCCI within the state. But the Constitution is careful to do away with any ambivalence that the phrase might imply. The Supreme Court saw no valid grounds to expand the definition of other authorities beyond what is laid down in the Constitution. There is a persistent drive on the part of certain sections of Indian society to increase the jurisdiction of the state. This only feeds the state?s own tendency to appropriate all institutions that are outside its realm. In political philosophy, the conflict between state and civil society is located in the state?s expansionist tendencies. The Supreme Court has thwarted one move to make the state more maximalist than it already is. But the fact that it did so on the basis of a 3:2 majority only suggests the opinion that prevails in favour of an ever-expanding state.

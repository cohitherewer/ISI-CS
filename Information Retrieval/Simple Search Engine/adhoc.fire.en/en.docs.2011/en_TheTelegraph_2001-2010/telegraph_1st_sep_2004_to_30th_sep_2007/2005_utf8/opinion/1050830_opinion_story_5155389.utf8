 BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED LANDS

 Afghanistan could play a crucial role in improving India-Pakistan ties and breaking the stalemate over Kashmir, writes Jyoti Malhotra

 Gripping action

 While flying over the Khyber and into Kabul, the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, must have mused on the ancient trade route between Afghanistan and Hindustan ? now wilfully snapped by Islamabad unhappy about losing its hold over the heart of the Hindukush after the formal banishment of the taliban in end-2001. And as expected, Singh did try to persuade Hamid Karzai and his government ? which need little persuasion ? to try and convert Pakistan to the virtues of reopening the trade and transit route to India. Afghanistan?s spectacular strides in the history and geography of central-south Asia, as the prime minister tried to remind it, reaffirm a variety of truths.

 First, the gas that will soon start flowing from the Daulatabad fields of Turkmenistan must traverse Afghanistan and Pakistan in order to find its rightful market in energy-hungry India. Second, Afghanistan?s ?kishmish diplomacy? would get the right boost with the simultaneous flow of goods down the old-new Grand Trunk Road, from Kabul to Calcutta, via Kallar Kahar and Kasur.

 Meanwhile, as part of his next move in the war against terror, Pervez Musharraf may well use the Indian visit to Kabul ? Manmohan Singh was the first prime minister to visit Afghanistan in 36 years since Indira Gandhi?s trip in 1969 ? to break the back of the double-crossing ISI and sundry armymen. They have deliberately and variously played off the Americans, Pakistan?s religious parties and the taliban against the others all these years.

 Writing in the International Herald Tribune earlier this month, Ahmed Rashid pointed to Maulana Fazlur Rehman?s diatribe against the Pakistani army, which he accused of misleading the West by allowing a revival of the taliban across the frontier badlands of Afghanistan-Pakistan. ?We will have to openly tell the world whether we want to support the ?jihadis? or crack down on them. We cannot afford to be hypocritical any more,? Fazlur Rehman said. Seems like the maulana was responding to the earlier accusation of the Peshawar Corps Commander Lieutenant General, Safdar Hussain, that ?some Pakistani religious parties? were publicly supporting the taliban. Clearly, the General was pointing a damning finger at Fazlur Rehman.

 Caught between the devil unleashed by its own army a decade ago, and the deep sea, recently circumscribed by America?s war against terror, Pakistan?s space to manoeuvre seems to be getting smaller and smaller. In such situations, the conventional wisdom usually proposed by the Pakistani establishment is, predictably, to ?target? Kashmir.

 But what if the president of Pakistan instead gave in to his instinct to trust India?s prime minister? After all, Singh and Musharraf are likely to meet again on September 14 in New York on the sidelines of the United Nations general assembly, and there?s nothing more the electronic media in both countries are obsessed with than the possibility of a hearty Punjabi hug between the sons of the soil. After this, both are supposed to take the discussion forward on Kashmir as well as a variety of other confidence-building measures, such as Siachen, intra-Kashmir trade and dialogue, human rights, amnesty for prisoners, the permanent demolition of the infrastructure of terror and greater political autonomy in Kashmir.

 But in many ways, it could be the act of building trust over a third country ? in this case, Afghanistan ? that may help break the India-Pakistan impasse. To do that, however, both India and Pakistan?s reformers must come to the rescue. Take, for example, Manmohan Singh?s pragmatic view that it would be cheaper, in monetary and security terms, if the Iran-India gas pipeline was allowed to run overland through Pakistan. Shaukat Aziz could, in turn, save the day by agreeing to Indian and Pakistani vehicles winging both sides of the Wagah and Khyber.

 Aziz?s argument to persuade his own security establishment could run as follows: Just as the Iran-India gas pipeline enriches the Pakistani exchequer by some $600 million in annual transit fees, and the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India pipeline gives a healthy bounce to the slipping south Asian rupee, Pakistan?s beautifully painted trucks could help recharge the aesthetic and economic acquifers across the subcontinent.

 For that, however, Musharraf would have to first cauterize the ?strategic depth? sting that the ISI and parts of the Pakistani army believe constitutes their special right over Afghanistan. Surely, the taliban and its many post 9/11 insidious incarnations hurt Pakistan as much as they now do the Afghans, the Americans and sundry Nato peacekeepers whose planes are being summarily and regularly shot down.

 The point is, it may be time for Pakistan to shut down the jihad factories as well as disengage itself from the artificial high that came with the control of Kabul, via the taliban. Musharraf?s recent expulsion of 1,400 foreign students and arrest of some 800 militants are the first steps in this widely appreciated process of ?cold turkey?. One possible option would be to pay off those elements within the Pakistani establishment making trouble with the money earned from the opening up of the trade and transit routes.

 Perhaps Manmohan Singh in Kabul could have come up with the idea of a car rally that will connect some of the dots on the map before they were partitioned off by some sub-standard minds in 1947. ?Kabul to Cox?s Bazaar, via Kandahar and Calcutta? would have been a great blurb, fully paid up by the best companies in the region. Even if that didn?t happen, Singh did manage to fairly impress on Afghanistan the idea of all sides making money happily together.

 Pakistan?s manifest destiny of being a ?bridge state? between south and west Asia, on the one hand, and south and central Asia, on the other, has often been extolled by its major thinkers. The time may have now come for India to both persuade and push Pakistan into making a tryst with that destiny.

 HOW TO REBUILD BETTER

 MALVIKA SINGH

 On the tsunami front, the real and strenuous work on relief and other structural changes will have to be addressed. How do you rebuild? Do you leave the conceptualizing and planning of the reconstruction to the PWD and government agencies who have built the most substandard structures across India, or do you use this opportunity to include innovative architects and NGOs to create an environment that enhances the dignity of living? The money-making builders and babus must be kept at bay. Here is a chance to deliver an effective prototype for the specific region encompassing traditional and cultural needs. 

 A sad truth we discovered was that the air force station in Car Nicobar had violated all the existing zonal and building laws when they established their base. The Central ministry of environment did not insist on enforcing the law and nor did the air force. Hundreds of people died, women and children as well. Shouldn?t someone be court martialed for that?

 At this moment, the ministry is covering up for itself, putting out propaganda in the press to defend itself, knowing well that it is guilty of violating laws that were piloted through parliament by Rajiv Gandhi. All the laws that should have been enforced along the coast are a Central subject, to be enforced by the states and not the other way round. Let the ministry of environment in Delhi not be allowed to get away with the horror they have subjected the citizens to. Let us not permit them to invite further disasters by turning a blind eye to the many scores of violations that continue to happen under our noses. If a bounced cheque, issued by an accountant, is a criminal offence for all board directors making them liable, violating laws such as the Environment Protection Act should be made a criminal offence because it physically destroys human lives. 

 Nothing new

 Elections in three states are on the anvil. Shibu Soren, despite cases against him, continues to be the leader in his state. Laloo Prasad Yadav has a similar position in Bihar and in Haryana, the Congress is poised for victory. That seems to be the consensus. However, rumblings from the ground indicate that the Congress may well pull off 50 seats in Bihar. The equations are then bound to change in the state despite Laloo?s strength at the Centre. The complacency of the Congress in Haryana, its cockiness and its in-fighting are bound to work against the party on polling day, making the positive into a negative, with a reduction of the margins. 

 It is here that the Congress has not learned any lessons from the past and seems to have no new ideas for the future. Its traditional politicos continue to play their predictable games, terrified of the new generation Congressman and woman whom they try to manipulate and isolate. Today they are running scared of the new entrants in the party who are not carrying the broken down baggage of the old losers. The latter cannot comprehend the new attitudes, fresh positions, commitments and approaches of the younger members of parliament and the assemblies. They have become hugely insecure. 

 In a state like Uttar Pradesh, where the Congress is working to rejuvenate itself, the mediocre, lethargic and possibly corrupt amongst the traditional leaders are playing at being saboteurs in the new dispensation there. Those indulging in these negative ?activities? must be exposed and not protected by the senior establishment. The young have to take over and in turn represent the new majority voter ? the constituents who are under the age of fifty.

 And, the Bharatiya Janata Party, at the other end, is desperately trying to make inroads into Tamil Nadu by using the sankaracharya episode as their latest ?cause? in the crusade for Hindu nationalism.

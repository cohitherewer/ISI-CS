 AN ILLUSION CALLED REALITY

 The could-be-sweet life

SPOONFUL OF GREY

By Diana Romany,

Mapinlit, Rs 225

The people we encounter in Diana Romany?s Spoonful 

of Grey are incurably restless and indecisive. They inhabit a reality which 

is either tantalizingly elusive or hopelessly splintered. They are weighed down 

by an ?unbearable lightness of being?, and float in the currents of dream and 

despair. The squalor lurking beneath the spectacular glitz of the consumerist 

urban life almost stifles them, and the rebellion they stage is either suicidal 

or self-defeating.

 Romany?s characters are engaged in a kind of shadow-boxing with a reality which naggingly persists without properly existing. Joseph and Natasha and Susan are all driven by a desire to escape from nowhere ? to nowhere. Geographical locations like Mumbai, Pune or Kerala are mere signposts in their endless and aimless psycho-meandering. From these, they glean memories to construct a life more comprehensible, if not more acceptable, than the one they have.

 The narratives are often brief sketches, with a few telling strokes. The pervasive blackness is lighted by flickers of hope. But these could just be flashes of a possibility of connecting things and deriving some meaning. Thus the story, ?Nicholas?, ends like this: ?She ignores him. He slows down. She?s got vacant eyes. Too many things in her head and nothing in her eyes. He stops. It could be sweet.? ?Victoria? offers a similar ending: ?When the traffic lights turn blue there?s no choice. He is startled when she turns and starts walking to him. It could be sweet.? In ?Blue morning Monday? too, the protagonist mumbles about her vague perception of life in the same vein: ?It could be sweet. But hey what do I know? I?m not even too sure where I stand in the food chain.?

 This ?could-be-sweet? life winks at you from Romany?s dashing, disturbing prose, which often resembles psycho-babble, as the author regularly dispenses with punctuation marks. At times, the prose format itself is ruptured ? as in ?Truth serum? ? or gets embroiled in dense image-clusters ? as in ?Nightwatch?. The book is not for nonstop reading, the ennui which pervades it is dangerously infectious.

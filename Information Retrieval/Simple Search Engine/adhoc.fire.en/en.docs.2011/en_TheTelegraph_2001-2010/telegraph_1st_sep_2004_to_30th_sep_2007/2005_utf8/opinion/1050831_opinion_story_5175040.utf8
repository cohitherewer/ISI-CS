 PUT TO TEST

 For generations, students have been stoically resigned to the fact that degree examinations conducted by the University of Calcutta are a life-changing gamble. The results are quite unlikely to be an indication of either their academic calibre or actual performance in the examinations. They might simply reflect the examiners? ignorance, callousness or prejudices, which would be impossible to pin down under the existing reviewing system. Hence these examinations have the arbitrariness and opacity of Destiny itself, and stoicism remains the best policy, even if that means a radical upsetting of career plans. This venerable, and shameful, tradition is now about to change. The pro-vice-chancellor (academic affairs) has decreed that head examiners would have to monitor, very much more strictly, the performance of the examiners themselves. 

 Reports have to be prepared that would help to identify teachers who are not up to the mark as examiners, and have been ruining the lives of the students by marking neglectfully or ignorantly. This move has been sparked off, of course, by the possibility of students being allowed to inspect their own scripts, with teachers chosen by them from their own institutions, if they suspect some sort of foul-play. And it is the fear of being exposed by this new system that has suddenly made the university sit up to the existence of incompetent examiners. Many thousands of candidates sit each examination every year. Therefore, most teachers end up marking a huge number of papers to enable the university to manage the rising volume of candidates. Hence, quality control is practically non-existent when it comes to the actual examiners and what they are doing with the scripts. The new system of monitoring is certainly welcome. But it is likely to reveal a sorry state of affairs. And the question remains as to whether a teacher who cannot mark scripts properly ought to be allowed to continue teaching at all.

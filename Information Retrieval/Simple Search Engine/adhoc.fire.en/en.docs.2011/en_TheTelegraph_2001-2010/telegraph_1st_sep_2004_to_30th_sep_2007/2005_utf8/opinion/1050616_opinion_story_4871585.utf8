 UNITED THEY STAND, DIVIDED THEY LOSE

 Despite the cries against Laloo Yadav?s ?misrule?, neither the CPI nor the CPI(M) is likely to part ways with the RJD, writes Sumanta Sen

 Still together

 The Communist Party of India is restless. In about another five months, Bihar will again go to the polls and the party is desperate to win back for itself even a fraction of the position it once enjoyed in the state. Yet it is in no position to achieve that by going totally alone. It must have a back to ride on. Laloo Prasad Yadav has never been much of a help to it and so the party wants to leave him by raising the issue of his ?misrule?. Earlier this year, of course, ?misrule? wasn?t an issue, judging by the fact that the party had a partial seat adjustment with him. This time, it wants more and by all accounts is eyeing Ram Vilas Paswan. Paswan is still ?secular? and also ?anti-misrule?.

 There is, of course, no principle involved here. If the election is really a fight against communalism, then the CPI would have been expected to have that thought uppermost in its mind and think twice before going in for a move that would split the secular vote. Perhaps not by much, given the party?s present strength but, as the last election showed, every seat counts. 

 Of course, things will change if Paswan patches up with Laloo Yadav. Then, on the issue of ?secular unity?, the CPI will also follow suit. After all, there is nobody else to team up with. There will also be Sharad Pawar and Mulayam Singh Yadav in the fray but they are yet to add up to much in Bihar. The CPI needs a two-digit strength in the house.

 The Communist Party of India (Marxist) is also restless, and it is in an even less enviable position than the CPI. But Laloo Yadav is now weak and the CPI(M) wants to take advantage of that. It has not said that it will go it alone, but has quietly ended Sitaram Yechuri?s role as the observer for Bihar. Yechuri was perceived to be too close to Laloo Yadav, which the state- level leaders did not like. The new observer, S.R. Pillai, may be to their liking. 

 Laloo Yadav, however, has the ears of Harkishen Singh Surjeet and Jyoti Basu, and both still matter in the politburo. Even now, Prakash Karat?s thoughts may not be entirely different from that of A.B. Bardhan. Both are realists and the present reality, both in Bihar and the rest of the country, does not make a war against Laloo Yadav appear worthwhile for the party. Paswan, who the other day was prepared to side with the Janata Dal (U), a constituent of the National Democratic Alliance, is a rather unstable alternative.

 The election is still some distance away. The left mood at present may not remain the same when the state goes to the hustings. The last time, the two parties together could not bag more than half-a- dozen seats and the situation on the ground does not suggest that things will be appreciably better in the coming round. 

 On the other hand, both Bardhan and Karat will have to view things in the overall context of their interaction with the United Progressive Alliance in New Delhi. They have decided to seriously take on the Congress on the issue of economic reforms and are looking for allies within the ruling alliance. Sharad Pawar has pleased them by opposing the proposed disinvestments in Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited but they need more on their side. Laloo Yadav has opposed any rise in petroleum prices and he too cannot be kept out of the left?s scheme of things. So why oppose him in his own home turf? 

 Also, on the issue of secularism, the man has time and again established his credentials. He had the courage to arrest L.K. Advani in Samastipur and put an end to his rath yatra, something which the then West Bengal counterpart, Jyoti Basu, could not do. So, ultimately, the CPI may decide to go along with him, particularly as Laloo Yadav has already promised to be more generous with seat allotment to the allies. Since the CPI(M) has never spoken out against Yadav, it will not have to change its stance as it remains with him.

 Laloo Yadav can remind the two parties of other things also. He was the lone non-Congress leader who had repeatedly urged the need for a broad secular platform on which the Congress would also be present to counter the Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies. In this, he had been able to rise above the anti-Congressism which is the sole plank of any socialist, and in his own state, had formed an alliance with that party. The communists, however, had not paid heed to him and had to sulk for six years. In 2004, it was Laloo Yadav?s formula that worked. And as long as the communists maintain that communalism remains a grave danger, will they really be able to ditch the man who was the first to suggest the only way in which the saffron brigade could be kept at bay? If they or the CPI alone does that, won?t it amount to splitting the secular vote? Laloo Yadav will immediately go to town with this charge. Will Bardhan then be able to counter it with any acceptable argument?

 Laloo Yadav himself does not appear to be much bothered with such posturing. He knows that ultimately it will boil down to the number of seats that he leaves for the left. He is also aware that he has a strong ally in Sonia Gandhi who, after last time?s mistake, is now desperate that the UPA votes are not split even to a small extent. A heart-to-heart chat with Bardhan and D. Raja and a ?courtesy? call on Surjeet may well achieve that. The Congress knows what the left is seeking to do with its allies and, like Laloo Yadav, would have no hesitation in making the same accusation of harming secularism if the CPI really goes it alone and causes some vital upsets for the NDA.

 Actually, if the CPI has a problem with Laloo Yadav, it has a greater problem with the CPI(M). That problem relates to the issue of controlling the district of Begusarai, once known as the Leningrad of Bihar. In the last election, the two parties had fought against each other there, dividing the left vote. The CPI, as the larger of the two parties in Bihar, has reasons to be upset over what it sees as Marxist intransigence and will have to get this sorted out at the national level. The task, however, will not be easy as at the state level, the parties are not exactly comrades in arms. In Bihar, the CPI cannot be expected to be the meek younger brother it is in West Bengal, Tripura and Kerala. But if the CPI tries to be assertive, the Marxists can always turn to Laloo Yadav for help as they did in the last polls. And if he really puts his heart to the job, he may well put the CPI in trouble. So there is a fratricidal battle to be fought along with the avowed intention of seeing the election as another war against the ?forces of communalism?.

 The CPI leaders may not admit this but it does seem that in their current stand they were inspired by the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist), which went alone and won seven seats. ?If Dipankar Bhattacharya could do this why can?t we??, seems to have been the question the CPI asked itself. And it is a question which others may also ask. 

 However, the performance of the CPI(M-L) was the result of sustained agitations in the countryside and it is doubtful whether the other two communist parties have done that. By distancing itself from Laloo Yadav and his ?misrule?, the CPI may at the same time send feelers to Bhattacharya. That would amount to another kind of piggyback-riding and why should the CPI(M-L) be interested in that? Its main and only task is to carve out a distinct political space for itself and it can have little respect for a party like the CPI which has been for long with either this or that ?force of oppression?. 

 While it is still too early to forecast whether such an electoral alliance would take place or not, it can be predicted, and with a fair measure of certainty, that as far as the CPI is concerned, it will in no way be prepared to take that alliance forward after the polls. For it, political activity has become totally election-centric. 

 The same also is true for the CPI(M). And the arithmetic of elections would suggest that they remain with the Yadav chieftain, particularly as they lack the power to take him on. This is unfortunate for the left but they have only themselves to blame for this.

 NO SOLUTION

 Strikes have come to prove two things: they add to people?s sufferings and they solve no problems. The transport strike in Bengal has been no different. The transport operators may be justified in demanding some financial relief from the government; but a strike is no way to get it. It makes people angry rather than sympathetic. True, the rising fuel costs make it more difficult for operators to run their business profitably. The spiralling international prices of crude oil have their inevitable impact on the domestic market. The result is an unavoidable rise in transport costs. But transport operators have learnt the basic economic law ? that consumers would be forced to move to other options beyond a point. So, they can no longer depend on the old rule of increasing the fares every time the fuel prices go up. Hence, their new demand that, instead of allowing them to raise the fares, the government reduce the taxes on fuel. In other words, the government should take part of the burden on itself. The problem is that the transport operators could think only of the old route of a strike in order to push their new demand. This is typical of old trade unionism, which trampled on the larger public good to promote sectional interests. 

 However, the West Bengal government?s response to the demand smacks of double standards. It is unwilling to reduce the taxes on fuel for the obvious reason that it will cut into the state?s revenue. Yet, the left parties made precisely the same demand to the Centre when the latter raised the fuel prices recently in the wake of the rise in the international prices. Their argument was pretty much the same as the one offered by Bengal?s transport operators. The leftists wanted the Centre to reduce the taxes on fuel so that consumers were spared the burden of the rising costs. The Union finance minister, Mr P. Chidambaram, refused to oblige the leftists on the same ground that the revenue loss would make it difficult for the Centre to provide for the resources necessary for its development programmes. But the arguments of both the Centre and the state government make it clear that they are wary of exploring new ways of raising revenue. Clearly, they are unwilling to risk unpopular policies. It may still be some time before governments in India can free economics from populist politics.

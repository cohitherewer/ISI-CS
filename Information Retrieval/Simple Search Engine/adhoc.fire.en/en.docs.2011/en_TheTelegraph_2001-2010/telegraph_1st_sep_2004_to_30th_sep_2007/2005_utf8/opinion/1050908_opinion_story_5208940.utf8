 TOUGH ACT

 Social justice requires the state to give special privileges to some people. But democracy works on the principle that all are equal before the law. There may thus be an inherent contradiction between law and social justice. The Jharkhand high court?s verdict that has stalled the first-ever panchayat polls in the state exposes the dichotomy once again. The fundamental question that the ruling raises is whether it is legally and morally valid to flout the principle of equality in order to help some sections of the people. What percentage of posts of panchayat bodies in a ?scheduled area? should be reserved for tribals is only secondary to the central debate. The court?s objection to 100 per cent reservation for the posts of chairmen and its ruling in favour of reducing it to 50 per cent could, however, create unprecedented legal complications all over the country. For, the Panchayat (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996, which provided for the reservation, is a Central law. Panchayat polls held in many states since the enactment of the law went by this reservation policy. The ruling from Ranchi could have its impact on all states. Equally controversial could be the court?s directive which wants panchayat seats to be reserved for people belonging to scheduled castes and scheduled tribes even in ?non-scheduled areas?. Reserving one-third of panchayat posts for women is less contentious, for the Constitution has a similar provision.

 For Jharkhand?s chief minister, Mr Arjun Munda, postponing the panchayat polls after the court verdict was the easier option. Its political fallout may prove more difficult to tackle. The tribals are upset that the ruling takes away what the law had given them. The Jharkhand bandh called by several tribal organizations is an indication of this. On the other hand, non-tribal communities are unhappy that some seats in the non-scheduled areas could now be taken away from them and reserved for tribals and people from the scheduled castes. All this could lead to a social divide between tribal and non-tribal communities. Jharkhand has already seen such a divide building up over the state?s domicile policy and also over the reservation of government jobs. While he mends the state?s own panchayat act and waits for the cloud to clear over the Central legislation, Mr Munda must not allow saboteurs to exploit the legal disputes and cause ethnic tensions.

 PERSONAL IS POLITICAL 

 There is nothing personal about family 

 law, says Tarunabh Khaitan. It is time we reclaimed 

 it as the problem of everyone interested in equality

 Home to discrimination 

 The controversy that has erupted 

 over the rape of Imrana Bibi by her father-in-law and the 

 subsequent annulment of her marriage by the Darul Uloom 

 Deoband embodies a tale of enduring injustice sustained 

 by unprincipled politics, a weak parliament and reluctant 

 courts. The former president, K.R. Narayanan, once pondered 

 over whether the Constitution has failed us or we have failed 

 the Constitution. The saga of ?personal? laws leaves one 

 in no doubt about where the blame lies.

 The very nomenclature of the law 

 governing family affairs as ?personal? is less about what 

 it is and more about what it is not. It certainly is not 

 ?personal? in the sense of operating between persons, for 

 the law of contract is no less inter-personal than the law 

 of marriage. A ?personal? law indicates that it is not the 

 business of the political process and the state to interfere 

 with ? it is a claim to be free from being accountable to 

 anyone and justifying the state of affairs. It is akin to 

 calling domestic violence a personal issue between the husband 

 and wife, and therefore everyone else should keep out.

 What is shocking is the acceptance 

 of this position by the political process. Mulayam Singh 

 Yadav?s delegation of his own intellectual faculty by saying 

 that the ?decision of the Muslim religious leaders in the 

 Imrana case must have been taken after a lot of thought? 

 reflects a viewpoint since Shah Bano that family law should 

 not be judged by any standards of reasonableness, justice 

 and fairness.

 The very idea of different laws 

 for different religious communities, which grant unequal 

 rights to people on the basis of their religion and sex, 

 falls foul with the guarantee of equality in the Constitution. 

 As the supreme law of the land, the Constitution clearly 

 indicates that any law that is contrary to its declaration 

 of fundamental rights must be invalidated by the Supreme 

 Court and the high courts. The religious freedom guaranteed 

 by the Constitution is subject to the primacy of fundamental 

 rights, and in any case does not extend to secular matters 

 such as family, marriage and divorce laws.

 One would have assumed that 55 

 years after this egalitarian aspiration was expressed by 

 the Constitution, much of family law would have become just 

 through judicial intervention. Sadly, the judiciary has 

 not lived up to its constitutional mandate.

 The Bombay high court was probably 

 the first court to be confronted with the question soon 

 after the Constitution came into force. In State of Bombay 

 v. Narasu Appa Mali (1952), the high court shockingly 

 declared that ?personal laws? were beyond the purview of 

 a constitutional scrutiny and need not therefore uphold 

 fundamental rights!

 Instead of overruling this clearly 

 wrong decision, the Supreme Court lent its own authority 

 to the validity of the position. In Krishna Singh v. 

 Mathura Ahir (1980), the Supreme Court said that a fundamental 

 right guaranteed by the Constitution ?does not touch upon 

 the personal laws of the parties?.

 These cases carve out an exception 

 for a set of laws, that do not even have parliamentary sanction, 

 from the scrutiny of the highest law of the land. The Supreme 

 Court tests even constitutional amendments to see if they 

 violate equality, which is part of the basic structure of 

 the Constitution. But a customary law governing family matters, 

 which can be repealed by simple legislative majority, has 

 been put on a pedestal higher than the Constitution itself. 

 This position defies justice as well as common sense.

 The discourse on family law in 

 India assumes a helpless Muslim woman as its main protagonist. 

 The sensationalized portrayal of the Shah Banos and the 

 Imranas in the media makes them ideal victims at the hands 

 of the fanatic other as well as unwitting heroines of the 

 secular/ communal cause, all at once. These portrayals hide 

 numerous lesser victims, whose individual sufferings might 

 not be interesting enough for the media, but raise difficult 

 ethical questions nonetheless.

 Even to this date Hindu women 

 do not have equal property rights as Hindu men, especially 

 in matters of succession and right to agricultural property. 

 The right to adopt is still not available to most non-Hindus. 

 Another most obviously discriminatory aspect of customary 

 Hindu law is the concept of the Hindu undivided family. 

 The HUF is considered as a separate legal entity and has 

 many financial benefits for tax purposes. The denial of 

 this benefit to Muslims and Christians is as much a denial 

 of equality guaranteed by the Constitution as is the denial 

 of rights by the respective ?personal? laws to Muslim and 

 Hindu women. Saying that Muslims have ?benefited? from these 

 laws is simply false and mischievous. This is not to deny 

 that those who resist reforms in the personal laws also 

 suffer from prejudiced myopia.

 The political process has failed 

 the Constitution as much as the judiciary. In promising 

 a uniform civil code, the Constitution hoped that the parliament 

 would respond to the demands of equality. Such a code need 

 not make all customs and rituals ?uniform? ? the aspiration 

 behind the promise is an equality of rights to all citizens, 

 irrespective of religion and sex.

 The All India Muslim Personal 

 Law Board has done immense disservice to the cause of Indian 

 Muslims by painting them as a monolithic illiberal, intolerant 

 and unjust people. The need for a genuine representative 

 leadership within the community, which is alive to its pressing 

 material needs instead of demanding the right to treat people 

 unfairly, cannot be overemphasised. Voices of dissent from 

 the newly formed Muslim Women?s Personal Law Board and other 

 such boards are a welcome challenge to this monolithic portrayal 

 of the Muslim community.

 Blindness to discriminatory aspects 

 of Hindu law has allowed the majoritarian Right to portray 

 the issue of ?personal? laws as problem of a fanatic minority. 

 If the Bharatiya Janata Party is principled in its demand 

 of a uniform civil code, it must accept that such a code 

 will outlaw the triple talaaq as well as the HUF, 

 that Hindu women shall also be given their due share of 

 rights. A ?uniform? law cannot choose to grant equality 

 in some respects and discriminate on others. The onus is 

 upon the BJP to demonstrate that it is not using the bodies 

 and rights of Muslim women to advance a sectarian agenda.

 The Congress? initial silence 

 was deafening, while its delayed attempt to shelve the debate 

 on personal laws, citing technicalities in Imrana?s case, 

 betrays signs of defensive nervousness. The left has to 

 demonstrate that it is doing more than paying lip-service 

 to equality in condemning the fatwa. Spending a fraction 

 of the political energy it invests on the question of disinvestment 

 on gender equality will surely help matters. The power to 

 make laws on family matters is shared by the Centre and 

 the states in the concurrent list. If the left is really 

 serious about the issue, amending the laws to ensure equality 

 in the states ruled by Left Front governments will be a 

 good beginning.

 The ?secularists?, ? la 

 Mulayam Singh Yadav, have demanded a suspension of rationality 

 and fairness in respecting the ?personal? laws of the minorities. 

 This is as much an attempt towards political segregation 

 of the Muslim community from the national mainstream as 

 is singling the community out for criticism of the laws 

 applicable to it.

 A good faith debate towards the 

 goal of securing equal rights for all citizens needs to 

 ensue. Meanwhile, the judicial tolerance of unjust and unconstitutional 

 laws must end. There is nothing ?personal? about family 

 law. It is time we reclaimed it as the problem of everyone 

 interested in equality.

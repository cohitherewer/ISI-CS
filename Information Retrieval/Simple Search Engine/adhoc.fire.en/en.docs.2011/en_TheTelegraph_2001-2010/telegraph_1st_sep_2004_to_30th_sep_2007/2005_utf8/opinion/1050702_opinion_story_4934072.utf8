 Letters to Editor

 Calling names

 Sir ? Looks like the former American president, Richard Nixon, and his secretary of state, Henry Kissinger, shared the poor opinion India?s former white rulers had of its people (?US releases 1971 papers?, June 30). So Indira Gandhi, despite being within her full rights to refuse to toe the US line prior to the 1971 war, was called the ?old witch?. Indians further earned the epithets of ?bastards? and being a ?slippery and treacherous people?. The US state department document shows that the White House had, and has, scant sympathy for India?s concerns.

 Yours faithfully,

 A. Megha, Hyderabad

 Troubled waters

 Sir ? The debate over the Sethusamudram has been convincingly won by J. Jayalalithaa (?Jaya up in arms over Suez of east?, June 26). While she has been most rational in her arguments against the project, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam has been quite the opposite. Although it is apparent that the Union minister for shipping, T.R. Baalu, has been hurrying the project to gain political mileage, the DMK leadership has avoided coming up with point-wise clarifications. 

 Baalu states confidently that the fishermen, coral reef and marine wealth will be protected. But how? Issues like soil and oxygen depletion, wind and wave conditions have been given the short shrift. Why weren?t the measures being taken by the government publicized? Why is the no-objection certificate from the state government being trivialized although the state will have to bear the costs of any eventuality? Is the nightmare of December 26 already so distant? 

 What is particularly distressing is the nonchalance of both the prime minister and the Congress president. Are the compulsions of coalition politics so extensive as to make the Centre turn a blind eye to the environmental fallout of another development grand plan?

 Yours faithfully,

Sushant Chatterjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is unfortunate that politics has taken the centre-stage in the Sethusamudram project. This project would solve the decades-old potable water problem for Tamil Nadu. J. Jayalalithaa is reported to have admitted that her own government had placed the proposal before the Centre for sanction. Now, perhaps, she cannot stand the DMK taking full credit for the project. Whatever the politics, the consequences of implementing the project should be considered before it is carried out. If that is not done, the inaugural function should be boycotted. 

 Yours faithfully,

R. Sekar, Angul

 Sir ? If Sri Lanka is going to be adversely affected by the Sethusamudram, why is it keeping quiet?

 Yours faithfully,

N. Chatterjee, Calcutta

 Fly away

 Sir ? A few days ago, while standing on the ninth-floor balcony of a house near the Dhakuria Lake, I spotted a bright yellow bird of the size of a mynah which had beautiful black wings. I could see the patterns on its wings because the bird was flying at a low height. I have never seen such a magnificent bird before. A search into a book on birds of Bengal and the internet told me that the bird was a male Golden Oriole. It is seen in many parts of Europe, Asia and America. It is usually a summer guest to other places and stays in a flock consisting of a few birds only. It is elusive and difficult to spot. A new entrant into any bird-watching group is often told to spot this bird as part of his training. I would like to know if this bird is native to Calcutta or a summer guest to the city? The sight of the bird made me cheerful. I am lucky to stay in a part of Calcutta which has a lot of greenery and wish others had the same luck. 

 Yours faithfully,

D.K. Bhattacharya, Calcutta

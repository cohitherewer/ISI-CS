 HIKE OMEN

 The Reserve Bank of India chose not to spring any surprises in its mid-term review of monetary policy and raised the reverse repo rate (the rate at which the Central bank accepts overnight money from banks) by the expected 0.25 percentage points to 5.25 per cent. The markets were widely anticipating such a move and had already factored it into bond prices. The RBI governor also pointed out that he has kept the bank rate unchanged, which indicates that inflation is likely to be benign in the medium term. However, the tone of the policy statement is decidedly hawkish on inflation. While agreeing that inflationary pressures have so far been contained in spite of sustained growth and rising oil prices, the governor has appended a long list of risks that could affect the outlook on growth and inflation. These include the need to ensure credit quality given the runaway rise in bank credit; the emergence of infrastructure as a major bottleneck for development; the rise in asset prices, especially housing prices; high oil prices; the widening trade deficit; and the hardening of international interest rates, which has implications for capital flows into India. Oil prices remain the main area of concern. The policy statement repeatedly says that ?upside inflationary pressures from oil prices can be expected to continue with attendant direct and indirect effects? and that it is difficult to contain inflation at 5.0 to 5.5 per cent without an appropriate policy response. In short, prices are likely to go up, and there is no alternative to hiking the reverse repo rate to rein in inflationary expectations. Given the current high rate of growth in the gross domestic product, this is also the right time to go in for a pre-emptive rate hike, as it is unlikely to have a serious impact on growth. The increase in the reverse repo rate as well as the tough talk on inflation are therefore attempts by the RBI to nip inflationary expectations in the bud.

 Interest rates throughout the financial system are likely to rise because, apart from hiking the reverse repo rate, the level of provisioning for banks? standard assets has been increased from 0.25 per cent to 0.40 per cent. Essentially, this means that banks will have to make higher provisions on their loans. That could lead to banks raising their lending rates to protect their profitability. In short, the RBI has attempted to strike a balance between ensuring growth and containing inflation while at the same time leaving the window open for further interest rate hikes.

 Letters to Editor

 There?s something about yoga

 Sir ? What exactly is so novel about Victoria Beckham?s decision to do yoga after delivering her third baby (?Yoga goes Posh as mom-to-be gets set to bend?, Feb 8)? She is certainly not the first white celebrity to do so. What is particularly annoying about the report is that nowhere does it mention the Indian origins of yoga. After reading about Victoria giving the credit for bringing yoga to the masses to Madonna, I am almost convinced that it will not be very long before we hear that it is the West that has revived and popularized a practice that was once Indian. 

 Yours faithfully,

Abir Sarkar, Calcutta

 Not all?s fair

 Sir ? The Kolkata Book Fair is only a book fair in name, since it seems to accommodate stalls of career consultants, FM radio channels, information technology pavilions and more. Most of them have little or no connection to books. The book fair is increasingly assuming the characteristics of a carnival where people of various interests gather, interact and have fun. Surely the book fair is not meant to be a carnival? 

 Book-lovers like me are becoming increasingly disheartened with the changing face of the book fair. It was started with the objective of popularizing books and to drive home the importance of reading. The Publishers and Booksellers Guild hoped to provide opportunities to small publishers. Another objective was to invite foreign countries and let cultures mingle. But the fair has become too commercialized in recent times. It is also sad that the little magazines, which have served as the true cradle of Bengali literature, have been pushed to a corner in the fair. 

 Yours faithfully,

Suman Talukdar, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The sceptical view that the Kolkata Book Fair is no longer drawing avid book readers is not entirely true. Yes, it is true that many couples and families troop down to the fair simply to have a good time together. But by staying close to the food stalls and away from the book stalls, they do not get into the way of book lovers. In fact, it is quite amusing to see buyers poring over their purchases while grabbing a quick snack or two. However, the administration should really do something about the menace that eve-teasers pose to young girls. 

 Yours faithfully,

Subhobrata Basu, Calcutta

 Sir ? Why should book pilferers at the book fair be treated any differently from any other thieves? Why should we buy the argument that many of the book-thieves love books but do not have the means to buy them? That logic could be extended to clothes and watches and shoes ? almost anything? Besides, many of the thieves are well-to-do kleptomaniacs. 

 One suggestion: if the thieves who get caught are found to be well-off, they should be fined five or ten times the price of the pilfered books, and in case of non-payment, they should be handed over to the police and punished as ordinary thieves. This might be able to put an end to the disgusting practice. 

 Yours faithfully,

K.B. Goswami, Calcutta

 Sir ? Isn?t it appalling that the Publishers and Booksellers Guild is taking so long to clear the mess that the book fair has made in the Maidan? Should it not be penalized for being late in clearing the garbage? If it are so worried about the conservancy charges that they have to pay the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, they could have considered raising it by charging a token sum of money from every participant in the fair. This should have been thought of well in advance. 

 Yours faithfully,

Meena Dutta, Calcutta

 Sir ? A person who steals a book not only deprives a paying reader from reading it, but also violates the dignity of the book. How is that a lesser crime?

 Yours faithfully,

Vinay Dokania, Howrah

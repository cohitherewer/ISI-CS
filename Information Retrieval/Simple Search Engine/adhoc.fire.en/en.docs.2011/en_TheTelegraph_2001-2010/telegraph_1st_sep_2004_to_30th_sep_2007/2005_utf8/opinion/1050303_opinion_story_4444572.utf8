 NOT SO SOLID

 Even before the budget, there were concerns about how the national common minimum programme expenditure commitments would be reconciled with requirements of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act. The FRBM Act requires elimination of the revenue deficit by 2008-09, the original deadline of 2007-08 having been postponed by a year by the United Progressive Alliance government. As the Kelkar report on implementation of the FRBM Act argues, this requires a zero revenue deficit in 2008-09 and a fiscal deficit/gross domestic product ratio of 3 per cent by the terminal year. As shares of GDP, the revenue deficit must therefore decline on an average by 0.5 per cent a year and the fiscal deficit by 0.3 per cent. The 2005-06 budget speech mentions these targets. Assuming revised estimate figures for 2004-05, there should have been a fiscal deficit ratio of 4.2 per cent in 2005-06 and a revenue deficit ratio of 2.2 per cent, if deficit reductions are evenly spread out over time. There is also the argument that deficit reductions should not be evenly spread out. With the economy doing well, they should be front-loaded, so that the burden of adjustment is lower in later years.

 Budget estimate figures for 2005-06 show a fiscal deficit ratio of 4.3 per cent and a revenue deficit ratio of 2.7 per cent. This suggests that fiscal reductions are more or less on target and there is some slippage on the revenue account. Hence, the finance minister?s argument that fiscal consolidation is on hold this year and will be resumed in 2006-07. But detailed scrutiny shows sleight of hand in the numbers. Loans of Rs 29,003 crore will be directly raised by state governments and Union territories for financing their annual plans. These should have been included in deficit and expenditure figures, but have not. So overall expenditure in the budget increases by 1.69 per cent and no more. Not all states and Union territories will be able to raise these loans. This figure alone amounts to 0.8 per cent of the GDP. That apart, no allowance has been made for revenue loss compensation to states consequent to value-added tax and the Rs 10,000 crore contingent liability accepted on account of infrastructure. And with extremely optimistic tax revenue projections, particularly on corporate and income tax, revenues may fall short. The announced disinvestment plan will not help, because those receipts will go into a separate fund. The fiscal deficit is thus likely to be around 5 per cent of GDP, if not more.

 LAST RESORT

 Violence is usually a loser?s last resort. But Mr Subash Ghisingh routinely threatens to use it to win elections in Darjeeling. Come elections and he threatens to go back to the violent days of the Gorkhaland agitation unless he has his way. There is a familiar ring to his threat to stall the elections to the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council and revive the stir for a separate state. But that does not make the threat any less ominous. Mr Ghisingh retains much of his power to incite violence in the hills. His latest threat has a different context though. Having led an elected body such as the council, he has no moral and political justification to threaten a violent agitation as an alternative to democratic elections. For the people of Darjeeling, the threat is a sad betrayal of their democratic hopes. The bitter memories of the bloodbath during the Gorkhaland agitation of the mid-Eighties must still be fresh in their minds. It is utterly irresponsible of Mr Ghisingh to use the threat as an electoral ploy. In fact, the people would see it as an attempt to cover up his failures as the council?s chairman for 10 long years. 

 His opponents have charged him with precisely that. To them, the threat to stall the elections is Mr Ghisingh?s nervous reaction to the mounting challenge to his political authority. Most of his principal opponents, including the Communist Party of India (Marxist), have joined hands to take him on during the coming elections. The elections are his chance to prove if he is still popular enough to withstand the challenge. The threat obviously has another motive. It is a veiled attempt to put pressure on the state government ? and the CPI(M) leadership ? to come to political terms with him. The suspicion has its basis in the fact that the government has danced to Mr Ghisingh?s tune before. The elections in Darjeeling were deferred by a year on his request. To the CPI(M) leaders, no price was too high to buy peace with him. The government?s anxiety to maintain peace in Darjeeling is understandable. But no responsible government can submit to demands that look and sound like blackmail. Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee should make it clear to Mr Ghisingh that the government is committed to its constitutional responsibility to hold the elections. It cannot allow any politician, however strong, to hold peace and people?s lives to ransom. The administration must act to set Darjeeling?s politics free.

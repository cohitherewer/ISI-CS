 BEYOND VIOLENCE

 Peace is too important to be left only to armed rebels and official committees. But the crucial thing for peace in Assam is not so much the composition of the team that negotiates with the Centre as the message that it carries from the rebels. The idea of involving civil society in peace talks is unexceptionable. For, the Assamese society at large ? and not just the government ? has a stake in peace in the troubled state. It is pointless to debate whether the team has been chosen because it truly represents the people or because its members are sympathetic to the rebels? cause. This is the first time the United Liberation Front of Asom has involved a wide cross-section of the Assamese intelligentsia in the peace initiative. This could make the exercise acceptable to the people at large, unless the rebels cynically exploit the whole thing to earn legitimacy for their violent struggle. There have been clear indications in recent years that the common people of Assam are frustrated ? and even angry ? with the ULFA?s ways of terrorizing them. The rebels still strike at chosen targets in order to keep the cadre?s morale high and to use violence as a bargaining tool. But they cannot be unaware of the popular disapproval of their senseless violence. 

 The real test of its intentions, therefore, lies, not with the mediators, but with the ULFA leaders themselves. It is for Mr Arabinda Rajkhowa, the ULFA?s chairman, or Mr Paresh Barua, chief of its armed wing, to spell out the outfit?s agenda for peace. It cannot be an optimistic scenario that has a team of mediators waiting to talk to New Delhi and the leaders planning and guiding acts of terror from their hideouts. The rebels continue to send out mixed signals when they reject the government?s offer of a ceasefire. The prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, has offered to start the peace talks ?unconditionally? if the ULFA gives up violence. The seven-year-long negotiations between the Centre and the Naga rebels suggest that even the demand for ?Assamese sovereignty? is no excuse for the ULFA to not respond to the government?s overtures. Neither New Delhi nor Dispur can, therefore, afford to lower its guard. The search for peace must begin in earnest; but the battle against violence has to be won first.

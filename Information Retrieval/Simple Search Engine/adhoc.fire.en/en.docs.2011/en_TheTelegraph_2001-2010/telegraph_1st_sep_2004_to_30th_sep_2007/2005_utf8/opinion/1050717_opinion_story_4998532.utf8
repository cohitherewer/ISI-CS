 DIARY

 Ayodhya, London or Oxford? They don?t know which one to blame. But ministerial hopefuls in the capital returned dejected after plans for a cabinet reshuffle were once again shelved last week. The AICC spokesperson, Anand Sharma, is even said to have taken a trial of the new bandhgala he would have worn for the swearing-in, and former Kerala CM, AK Antony, postponed his annual Ayurveda rejuvenation therapy to be in the hotspot. But no! The inordinate delay in extending the loaves and fishes of office is being attributed, by the know-all, to less obvious things ? the difference of perception between the UPA chairperson and the PM. Sonia, apparently, sees the old guard, consisting of PM Sayeed, Shivraj Patil, HR Bharadwaj, Arjun Singh, Mani Shankar Aiyar and Natwar Singh, as ?assets?. Not so the PMO. For the latter, these bumbling yet ambitious men are a cause for much discomfiture. There was first an insistent Natwar who had to be dissuaded from going to the US prior to Manmohan, apparently to tie up ?loose ends?. There is now a high level meeting planned to cement the Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline, which the PMO thinks is not such a great idea before the US trip. True to his low-key style, the PM has set up an energy panel under him to prevent Sayeed and Aiyar from going overboard. But then boys will be boys!

 About another boy of a different colour. Arun Jaitley is on his way to recovery after his bypass, but is being sorely missed by partymen and scribes alike. He was the BJP gen-sec in charge of tumultuous Bihar, but may now be replaced by the flamboyant Pramod Mahajan. The likelihood of Pramod?s entry has, quite obviously, rattled Uma Bharti, who was Jaitley?s deputy in Bihar, where the duo were referred to as ?Bunty aur Bubbly?. Jaitley will be missed in Chennai too, particularly during the de-briefing sessions. Sushma Swaraj may take over. The party?s way of ensuring that the show still runs, full house.

 One always knew it would be difficult to keep Pramod Mahajan down for too long. Which is why there are now questions galore about Spice Jet, the new lost-cost carrier which started its flights between Delhi and Ahmedabad for a steal last week. The MD of the airline is Ajay Singh ? former OSD to Mahajan when he was minister in the NDA government ? who gets Re 1 for his services. Whose hard work is it then that is flying Spice?

 Last week, as some scribes sat with Anand Sharma during a de-briefing session in the party?s media room, one noticed that the photographs of Bapu, Indira, Rajiv and Sonia hung together on one wall, while that of Nehru was left alone on another. When this was being pointed out, another noticed that the photo of Ambedkar similarly hung alone on another wall. Sharma was asked why the Congress was isolating poor Ambedkar. With aplomb, he is believed to have said, ?You see, actually, Ambedkar was never a part of the Congress mainstream.? It is yet to be clarified if the perception of Sharma, a Himachali Brahmin who started his career with the ABVP, is shared by the party honchos. Meanwhile, the Himachal CM, Virbhadra Singh, is supposed to have written to Sonia Gandhi, saying that no Rajya Sabha MP from Himachal (and Anand is one) should be made a minister at the Centre. Looks like the new bandhgala will remain unused for a while.

 Things were already bad for poor Ajit Jogi. Now they seem to have got worse with his son?s arrest, after which 10 Janpath has completely shut him out. Jogi?s supporters believe that the bungalow allotted to him is to blame for all this. Earlier, the house on 4, Motilal Nehru Road, had been given to Shibu Soren, who was arrested on a non-bailable warrant. Why is then Jogi wasting time knocking on Sonia?s door instead of going house-hunting?

 A rebellion is brewing in the Congress-ruled states, where the CMs are up in arms against the new Sonia-appointees as party chiefs. In Punjab, Shamsher Singh Dullo, is a known adversary against Amarinder Singh; in Delhi Rambabu Sharma has opened a front against Dixit; in Karnataka it is Mallikarjun Kharge against CM Dharma Singh; in Assam it is B Kalita against Gogoi. There are similar fears in Arunachal and Kerala. But is madam listening?

 As the sangh may be discovering, much to its chagrin, it is difficult to discourage George Fernandes. Unfazed by Sushma Swaraj?s snub after he came out in support of LK Advani and asked the RSS to stay away from politics, Georgie Porgie is now busy regaling everyone who would care to listen with stories of his proximity with the sangh when he was young. George is supposed to have told a gathering in the capital recently that he was once a devout pupil of Golwalkar, who was a neighbour of one of his best friends. He went on deliberating on how he availed of the RSS?s services to resolve matters. As a minister in the VP Singh government, he insisted, he had even air-dashed to Nagpur for guidance with the full knowledge of the PM and the left. The die-hard socialist purportedly said he even had a room where he used to break bread with the sanghis once a week. Other secularists also frequented the place. Play on, George.

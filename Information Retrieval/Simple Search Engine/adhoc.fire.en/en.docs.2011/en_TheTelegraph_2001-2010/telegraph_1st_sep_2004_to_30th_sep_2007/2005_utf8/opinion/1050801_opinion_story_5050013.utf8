 A FEW OBSCENE THINGS

 GWYNNE DYER

 Let?s talk dirty. The 9/11 suicide hijackers ? all Arabs ? attacked the United States of America instead of Brazil or Japan because the US government has been neck-deep in the politics of the Arab world for long, whereas the Brazilian and Japanese governments have not. 

 Indeed, no other non-Muslim nation except Israel was a target of Islamist terrorist attacks until after the invasion of Iraq in March 2003. And the attacks since then have been aimed at countries complicit in that invasion: Londoners, not Parisians; Spaniards, not Germans; Australians holidaying in Bali, not Japanese holidaying in Malaysia.

 There you have it: two full paragraphs of obscenity. Tony Blair himself says so. He informed us last Tuesday that any attempt to link the terrorist attacks that struck the London transport system on July 7, and the subsequent failed attempts on July 21, to his decision to follow the Bush administration in invading Iraq was ?an obscenity?.

 That?s nonsense, of course. All the comments in the first two paragraphs of this article are about cause and effect. You may agree or disagree with them, but discussions of cause and effect are still permissible and even necessary. So how does Blair ? and George W. Bush in Washington, and John Howard in Canberra, and their partners elsewhere ? get away with forbidding us to talk about what is causing all this?

 Don?t believe

 The key technique, which they all use, is to claim that any attempt to explain why these attacks are happening is to condone and justify them.

 Blair gave a virtuoso demonstration of the technique last Tuesday. He urgently needed to put some distance between his decision to invade Iraq and the phenomenon of young, British-born Muslims, not of Arab origin, blowing themselves and a large number of Londoners up. So he deployed his considerable rhetorical skills to change the subject.

 What he said was this. ?It is time we stopped saying: ?Okay, we abhor [al Qaida?s] methods but we kind of see something in their ideas or they have a sliver of an excuse or a justification for it.? They have no justification for it...Let?s just get that out of the way as well. There is no justification for suicide bombing in Palestine, in Iraq, in London, in Egypt, in Turkey, anywhere.?

 Cause and effect

 Nobody had actually said that suicide bombings are justified. What they are saying, in increasing numbers, is that actions have consequences, and that the reason a few young British Muslims became suicide bombers in 2005, whereas none at all became suicide bombers in 2000, is precisely the invasion of Iraq in 2003.

 As the CIA pointed out recently, the invasion of Iraq has turned the US into a breeding ground for a new generation of Arab jihadis. What it failed to add was that it has also spread the virus of Islamist terrorism into Muslim communities in Western countries that earlier contained only a few fanatics. 

 The problem is that the invasion of Iraq made it look as if the Islamist extremists, who had barely any credibility outside the Arab world even ten years ago, were right. If there were no terrorists in Iraq, why was it invaded? Because there is a Judaeo-Christian conspiracy to destroy Islam, stupid. If there is another Islamist terrorist attack on the US, it is more likely to come from within the resident Muslim community, as it has in Britain, than from foreign infiltrators.

 Most American Muslims, like most British Muslims, are appalled by the radical doctrines that are sweeping some of their young men and women away. But it is self-serving nonsense on the part of the governments of these countries to pretend that this is just some inexplicable outburst of violence by weird Muslim people. The laws of cause and effect still rule.

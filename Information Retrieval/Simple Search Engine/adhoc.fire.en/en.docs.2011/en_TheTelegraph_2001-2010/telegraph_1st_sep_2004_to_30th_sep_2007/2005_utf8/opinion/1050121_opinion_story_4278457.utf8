 ROOT CAUSE

 The smart machinery has moved into place, but is looking rather tatty. With its renowned precision, the Bharatiya Janata Party has allotted days, places, jobs and the people to go with each in the campaign for the forthcoming assembly elections in three states. But its platform is limited. The party is depending almost entirely on playing up the communal divide. Perhaps it is caught in its own dizzying circle, because if the Lok Sabha elections taught the BJP anything at all, it should have been the lesson that religion does not always pay. In Bihar, where the Union minister for railways, Mr Laloo Prasad Yadav, is trying to make as much hay as possible from the recent Godhra investigation report, the BJP has found Mr Narendra Modi to fall back on. The BJP?s loud protestations ? and repeated depositions by policemen in charge when Godhra broke ? about conspiracies and gallons of petrol are sounding a bit thin against the report submitted by the judge, Mr U.C. Banerjee, which is also consistent with earlier independent forensic findings. The truth is now lost in a mist of unscrupulous politicking, but defiance and arrogant repetitions of lies are the BJP?s only face-saving strategies. By the same logic, only the Gujarat chief minister, Mr Narendra Modi, who has perfected the art of blank arrogance in the face of the most shameful exposures of various truths after the Gujarat carnage, can be the BJP?s mascot in Bihar.

 India?s people cannot be glibly read off with one formula, as political parties, most recently the BJP, have always found. Therefore, if the BJP hopes to repeat its assembly successes of December 2003, it should be on the basis of this sense of humility, and not by trying to stir up communal divisiveness. But it seems that the party has nothing else to show. Even if it had planned to play up Ms Uma Bharti?s ?backward class? identity in Bihar, it would have been rather pointless, since her caste is a rare presence in that state. But she is a firebrand ?Hindu?, and with Mr Modi on the rampage ? frantically covering up Godhra ? the Hindu line might just catch on. The BJP is also going to rake up the communal refrain along the tribal belt, rehearsing its old line about Christians proselytizing tribal people. It is interesting that the BJP is no longer differentiating itself from the more extreme Hindutva groups in the sangh parivar: defeat has returned it to its roots.

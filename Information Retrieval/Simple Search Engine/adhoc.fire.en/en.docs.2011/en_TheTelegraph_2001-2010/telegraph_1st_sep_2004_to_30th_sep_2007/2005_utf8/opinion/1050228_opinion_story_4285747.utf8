 WAR WITH A LOVE POTION

 Gwynne Dyer

 The old Sixties slogan urged people to ?Make Love, Not War,? but who says you have to choose? If you drove the other side?s soldiers mad with lust, then they?d be too busy with each other to cause you much trouble. Of course, there is still a severe shortage of women in most front-line formations, but that shouldn?t be a problem. In fact, it could be an advantage. We could call it the ?gay bomb.?

 It was the Sunshine Project, a group devoted to exposing research into chemical and biological weapons, that revealed the proposal for an aphrodisiac weapon, that figured in a 1994 funding request from the research lab at Wright-Paterson Air Force Base in Ohio. 

 ?Category No. 3: Chemicals that affect human behaviour so that discipline and morale in enemy units is adversely affected. One...example would be strong aphrodisiacs, especially if the chemical also caused homosexual behaviour.? Full marks for lateral thinking, boys, but have you considered the implications of your little idea?

 Chemical reaction

 What if terrorists get their hands on this weapon and set about to subvert America?s moral fibre in a really big way? Random attacks on church services, sales conventions, high school pep rallies ? the imagination quails at the prospect. But mercifully, the gay bomb was never developed. In fact, the people proposing to do the research didn?t have the faintest idea of what chemicals, if any, might produce the results they described. They were just fighting for their share of the research budget.

 But there really is no limit to the scientific imagination when it comes to weapons. Take the case of the chicken-powered nuclear land mine. Back in the mid-Fifties, the British army was wrestling with the question of how to give British troops time to retreat if the Soviet hordes broke through their defences in Germany. And so they got on with it, taking the standard British free-fall nuclear bomb of the time, the fetchingly named Blue Danube, and designing a pressurized, water-tight casing for the land-mine version.

 When completed, the new weapon, Blue Peacock, weighing 7 tonnes, could be buried in the ground or sunk in a lake, and it could be detonated either by wire, from a command post up to 3 miles away or by an 8-day clockwork device.

 Strange weapons

 It was a quite serious, if fundamentally insane, piece of technology. But there was one hitch. It gets very cold in the winter in Germany, and nuclear weapons are sensitive devices that do not like the cold. Tests suggested that the warhead simply would not work if Blue Peacock was left buried in the ground or immersed in water in the winter months.

 The boffins at the Armament Research and Development Establishment in Kent were not daunted: in a 1957 memorandum, they suggested a variety of ways to keep the buried or submerged casing warm before it was detonated. The most attractive, by far, was a proposal that a flock of chickens should be put into the casing before it was closed and planted somewhere. There would be enough air to keep them alive for some days, and their body heat would keep the weapon warm.

 In the end, the suicide chickens were never deployed, which is probably just as well because the designers seem to have overlooked the fact that chickens produce copious amounts of chickenshit, which gums up even the finest machinery. Blue Peacock was cancelled in favour of a more compact nuclear land-mine based on newer technology and with a built-in heater. What does it all mean? Oh, not very much, except that no idea for a new weapon is so bizarre, vicious or plain silly that it won?t find an advocate somewhere in the military-industrial complex. It is a very big beast, and it has to be fed constantly.

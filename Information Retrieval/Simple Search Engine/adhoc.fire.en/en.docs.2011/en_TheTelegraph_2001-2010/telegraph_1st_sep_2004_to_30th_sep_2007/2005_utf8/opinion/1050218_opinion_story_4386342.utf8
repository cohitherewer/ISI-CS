 BETWEEN EAST AND WEST

Indulekha 

By O. Chandumenon, 

Oxford, Rs 295

Indulekha is a story about a beautiful, aristocratic, 

accomplished, English educated woman who is in love with an eligible young man, 

Madhavan. The only impediment is Indulekha?s grandfather who has a quarrel with 

Madhavan and swears not to let his grand-daughter marry him. This should not have 

been, however, of much concern because a woman had the right to choose her husband 

in Nair society. Yet, the story proceeds with unnecessary complications and leaves 

the modern reader wondering what so much fuss is all about. 

 The novel critiques the system of semi-legal marriage called sambandham. In this a Namboodhri Brahmin could take a number of Nair wives (without any of them being his legal wife) but the children borne out of such a union would have certain rights to claim from the father. The women also wielded some power in this queer arrangement, but the overarching superstructure was overtly patriarchal. 

 It should be remembered that the novel was written in 1889 and is considered to be the first novel in Malayalam. Chandumenon had started writing Indulekha when he was finding it difficult trying to translate Lord Beaconsfield?s English novel, Henrietta Temple, in Malayalam. He became an avid reader of English novels, and used to tell these stories to his friends in Malayalam. That was when he realized the need for a ?novel? form for his readers. 

 Early Indian novelists were caught in a dilemma between reality and realism. The 19th century English novels that they read concentrated on realism. This is what the Indians wanted to imbibe but the Indian reality was obviously different from the English one. The nature of a man-woman relationship was one such reality. Indian society could not apprehend it, and so it could be represented only through historical or mythical characters. This is reflected in Chandumenon?s work. 

 The novel is a blend of West and East in that it copies the English romantic plot, and relates it through the Indic mode of oral narration. The heroine is reminiscent of Austen?s heroines. However, it is not that it was a direct borrowing from the West. For the social context of 19th century India has amazing parallels with that of the 17th and 18th century England.

 Indulekha, translated by Anitha Devasia, is one of the most re-published and critiqued novels in the history of publishing, with reprints almost every year for a hundred years. Through the apparently inconsequential plot of the novel, one gets a perspective, for example, of the impact of English education, the Nair matrilineal society and the strain among the Nair women.

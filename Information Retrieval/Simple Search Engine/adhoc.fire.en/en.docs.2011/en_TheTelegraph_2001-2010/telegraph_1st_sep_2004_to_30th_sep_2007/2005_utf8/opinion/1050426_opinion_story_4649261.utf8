 Letters to Editor

 What women want to study

 Sir ? It is good to note that the government has woken up to the fact that fewer women are pursuing science compared to other streams (?Science in search of women?, April 25). Science demands greater number of years as a student. This, along with problems of mobility among women, is a deterrent. Unlike commerce, study of science depends a lot on infrastructure ? which in India could do with some improvement. I remember how, as a student of Class IX, I dreaded the physics practical classes on earth?s gravitational force because the stopwatch in our school laboratory did not work. I am sure boys face similar problems, so pursuing science is not really a gender issue. Let the government do all it can for women ? provide scholarships, publicity, encouragement, awards ? but let it not resort to gimmicks like reservation. Indian women deserve better than such lollipops.

 Yours faithfully,

Bedashruti Mitra, Raigarh

 Running after ruin

 Sir ? Ashok Mitra considers India to be awash with money (?A cynic on cricket?, April 18). While lashing out against the commercials on television during cricket telecasts, he forgets that money is not a crop which you can easily grow in a field. If everything were to be ?doled? out by the state, then soon the state would have nothing left. Mitra asks readers to wake up to the damage economic liberalization has done to India. It is he, it seems, who is yet to wake up. As far as cricket telecast goes, until the mid-Nineties, we had to endure the terrible telecasts by Doordarshan. Sure there were less commercials, but cricket-watching is hardly fun if you cannot follow the ball on the screen. Where does the money to invest in better technology and hiring of competent commentators come from? Not from the fields in the author?s imagination. Even today, if a cricket match is being parallely shown on ESPN or Star Sports and Doordarshan, most people would prefer the ?foreign? channels despite the greater abundance of adverts. Doordarshan has poor camera-work, second-string commentary and no pre- and post-match analysis worth speaking of. 

 The author is also utterly disdainful of India?s middle classes who, according to him, ?hanker? for consumer goods. But it is the middle class which is the moving force of India. Mitra also seems to have issues with the corporatization of cricket. What is wrong with that, I say? It is only because cricket has been converted to an industry that we see sponsors coming forth, ensuring a better fare for viewers, setting up coaching centres and sponsoring aspiring players. And who can deny that India has improved its standing in international cricket in the past 10-15 years? I remember the times when loss was what people expected when India was playing. Today, our anger at India?s defeat shows how much we are winning of late. The same model should be applied to every single sport in India. Perhaps that will help India win some medals at the Olympics at last.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? An old communist?s tirade against the commercialization of cricket may not cause even a ripple in the relevant quarters. This is because cricket has been an extremely willing victim of the forces of globalization. This is crudely evident in the way our cricketing heroes remain engrossed in off-the-field activities. Maybe that is what caused the sharp slump in Sourav Ganguly?s form. 

 Yours faithfully,

Protyush Mozumder, Calcutta

 Sir ? Bob Woolmer has suggested the remedy of three-dimensional players for the rejuvenation of Indian cricket. But although he mentions the batting credentials of Irfan Pathan, he has missed out the bowling acumen of Dinesh Mongia and S. Sriram, who bowl much more regularly in first-class cricket than the likes of Yuvraj Singh and Virender Sehwag. India could learn from the way Sri Lanka has been successful with their spinner all-rounders like Sanath Jayasuriya and Upul Chandana. The problem with India, even under the dynamic leadership of Sourav Ganguly, has been that batsmen who can bowl are not groomed as all-rounders and bowlers who can bat are allowed to continue only as entertainment packages when it comes to batting. The Indian think-tank must realize that all-rounders, when they are not born, can be made. Pakistan has shown how with Azhar Mahmood, Abdul Razzaq, Shoaib Malik and others.

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Sir ? Now that India is firmly ensconced in the eighth position in the ICC?s one-day rankings, above Zimbabwe, Bangladesh and Kenya, it is perhaps time to think about the future. There is no international cricket for India for at least three months, so there is time to rebuild the team. During this period, at least 60 potential talents, including the current ?nationals?, may be divided into four teams and made to play a domestic tournament. This will give players the chance to show their skills, so that we do not have to go on selecting only the holy cows. The new-look team will have little to lose; it surely can?t sink lower than no. 8.

 Yours faithfully,

Susanta Ghosh, Calcutta

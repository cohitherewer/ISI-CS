 A PRIVATE ACCOUNT

 Between two Worlds: A Rajput Officer in the Indian Army, 1905-21: Based on the Diary of Amar Singh of Jaipur By DeWitt C. Ellinwood Jr., Lanham, Maryland, Hamilton, $ 55

 For historians, the only available indigenous source for conditions in the British-Indian army in the early 20th century is the diary of Amar Singh. The diary of Amar Singh, a Rajput officer of the sepoy army, covers 44 years of his life. All of 89 volumes, each 800-pages long, it is one of the longest diaries in the world. Lloyd I. Rudolph and S.H. Rudolph had published a selection of this diary covering 1898-1905. In this 675-page volume, DeWitt C. Ellinwood covers the period, 1905 to 1921. While the Rudolphs focussed on the social and intellectual dimensions, Ellinwood highlights Amar Singh?s military experiences. Ellinwood also gives detailed notes contextualizing the many facets of army life.

 Like all Indian officers, Amar Singh too was a victim of the raj?s policy of racial discrimination. Singh pours out his frustration in his diary. He was not given any worthwhile jobs in the regiment. The British high command was not interested in training Indians in the tactics of modern warfare. Most of the time, Singh was assigned as aide de camp to a general. His task was to care for the general?s horses and ride with him. So, Singh had long hours of leisure, which he spent reading books and hunting. The latter was a traditional pastime of Rajput aristocrats, but, unlike other Rajput Thakurs, Singh considered keeping concubines, going to nautch girls and drinking too much, morally degrading.

 Being deprived of a promotion made Singh disinterested in a career in the army. He confessed in his diary that he was only marking time and would leave the sepoy army as soon as he got a good post in a princely army. But durbar politics prevented Singh from becoming commander-in-chief of a princely army. So Singh engaged in intrigues with British officials in Rajputana to realize his dream of finding employment in a princely army as well as to protect his estates from the greed of the courtiers at the durbar.

 Thus, no matter what the British believed, even the so-called martial races were alienated by their reluctance to devolve power to the Indians. This brings into question Pradeep Barua?s view (elaborated in Modernization of the Indian Army) that the raj had a time-bound policy of Indianizing the officer corps.

 FOR SOME MENTAL EXERCISE

 MALVIKA SINGH

 When parliament is in session, the press gives us ? the guinea pigs who read newspapers ? no real reportage of the debates in the two houses, the differences of opinion, the arguments, the pros and cons of the bills that have been tabled. They report nothing of consequence. It is frivolity all the way, from superficial news about the split of a Bollywood marriage to the infighting in political parties. Some basic national headlines do appear, usually about a policy initiative or adjustment. Others describe rape and abduction, many relate how buses mow down innocent people as they hurtle down city streets having paid off the cop who should prevent this mad driving. Some column space is regularly devoted to the improprieties of civil servants and their continuing harassment of citizens! Television replicates the same stories with walking, talking visuals. That is how India comes across the footlights.

 I have often wondered, in complete bewilderment, why Sunjay Kapur?s and Karishma?s failed marriage makes ?national news?? Is it something that young people should emulate and therefore needs lead-story attention? Is the new urban Indian mind so flaccid that it is only able to absorb frivolity? Why this terrible dumbing down? Why this presumption on the part of the press that Indians are foolish and uninterested in anything half way serious? Why this supreme arrogance towards the citizens of India who buy newspapers and read them?

 Rented space

 For days and weeks we had to read the same old stuff that was churned out by the media on L.K. Advani?s comment on M.A. Jinnah. It was theatre of the absurd at its worst. It just did not merit the space it got. Equally silly was the harangue against the prime minister for his passing comments on the raj. If political rivals felt that these two instances needed to saturate the pages of the print media, why did the press fall prey to the stupidity? Why has the press handed its vehicles to the warring factions to use against each other? It is like renting out the space as an akhara, a political akhara! This deterioration in how we choose and disseminate information in this country, is sad. We are presented as a rather unthinking and foolish polity, which we are not. 

 Indians, whether rural or urban, privileged or not, literate or illiterate, are intrinsically sharp, philosophical, and have lively, energetic minds. This strength has been evident through centuries and across the globe. It is Indians themselves, particularly those who rule, who demean other Indians. This attitude has led to a dilution of pride. Fortunately, we are beginning to see the transition from being a complacent people to a society that is, albeit hesitantly, making demands and questioning the ?unacceptable?.

 The UPA has tabled many important bills in this session of parliament. The women?s reservation bill was, needless to say, deferred yet again. In the interim, the Congress should take the lead and ?order? that in the party, 50 per cent of the tickets distributed will go to women. Let them make it their aim to identify and draw out women candidates who have served in panchayats et al, and bring them to the next level of democratic politics. 

 We have had enough of the chatter and the hype. The time has come to show the pace. The left must do so too. They claim to be different and ?progressive?, so why not some more women in the politburo? Unless political parties and their present leadership believe in gender equality, no such bill will ever be passed through parliament. 

 If the fossilized bureaucracy loosens up and allows new ideas to enter its portals, accepts the fact that it is stuck in a time warp, that the parameters it works within are redundant, the change waiting in the wings will follow.

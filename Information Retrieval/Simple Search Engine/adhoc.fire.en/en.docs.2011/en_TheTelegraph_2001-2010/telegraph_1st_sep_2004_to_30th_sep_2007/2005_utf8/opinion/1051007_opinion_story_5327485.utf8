 YOUNGER BRIDES

 The legal definition of ?consent? is not the same as its semantic significance. That is assumed the moment an ?age of consent? is fixed. It makes a distinction between a 12-year-old girl saying ?yes? to a boy wanting to marry her and an 18-year-old girl saying ?yes? in the same circumstances. It is possible to believe in the existence of twelve-year-olds who know their own minds; certainly no age of consent is needed when they are put to work in homes and shops or sold off into sex slavery. Unlike child labour and sex slavery, marriage is the type of a non-coercive relationship. So it is with perfect awareness of a certain arbitrariness that an ?age of consent? is fixed for a marriage to be legal. The point fixed upon ? and it has changed over the years ? is thought of as the ideal minimum. What determines the age are considerations of health, education, employability and, perhaps, mental maturity. At this age, young women from all segments of society may be expected to cope intelligently with married life and bring up children.

 The Delhi high court?s decision that girls of 15 have reached the ?age of discretion? and can therefore have valid marriages if they marry out of their ?own free will? exposes the unease that is generated by fixing an age of consent. The court was responding to cases in which minor girls had eloped with men who were being charged with kidnapping. The penalty for eloping with a minor can include that of statutory rape. This would be also punishing the girls, if they have wished to marry the men. There is humanity and reason in the court?s decision with regard to particular cases, but it raises far more questions than it answers. What does ?free will? mean for young people, especially girls, in the midst of social, economic, familial and sometimes even religious pressure? On a less philosophical plane, what special powers does the court have to decide whose will is free? Can the court enter people?s hearts? To move away from the age of consent would also allow full freedom to the vengefulness of orthodox societies and disappointed families. Most important, in a country where child marriage and trafficking of minor girls are still uncontrolled, can the age-of-consent principle be fiddled with without causing damage? To elope with a minor is a serious offence. It might seem harsh and unfair in certain cases, but laxity in principle will cause far greater harm than possible good.

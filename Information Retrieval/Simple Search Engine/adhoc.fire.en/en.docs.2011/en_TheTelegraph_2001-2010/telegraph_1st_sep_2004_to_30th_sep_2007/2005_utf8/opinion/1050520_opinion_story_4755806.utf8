 Letters to Editor

 Yet another loss

 Sir ? Roberto Mendes de Silva, Beto to his fans, bidding adieu to Mohun Bagan Athletic Club is a typical example of the club giving short shrift to its players (?Saviour Beto says goodbye?, May 19). Beto, however, is not the only victim of the club?s politics ? remember how it forced Barreto, arguably the best foreign player it has ever had, to quit? Beto may not be as good as Barreto but it cannot be denied that the former bailed out the team on numerous occasions. A little more support from the club and who can say that Beto would not have turned into another Barreto? Perhaps there is a case for the special officers giving former players a bigger role in managing the affairs of the troubled club. The least any player can expect is to be rewarded for his services. Sadly, that has ceased to be the norm in the countrys oldest football club, as the trophies continue to walk into its arch rival?s tent.

 Yours faithfully,

 Basudeb Dhar, Calcutta

 In the line of fire

 Sir ? The manner in which the Union defence minister, Pranab Mukherjee, got assaulted by Congress workers protesting against the distribution of election tickets for the forthcoming civic polls raises serious doubts about the security arrangements for our political leaders (?Pranab defence cracks?, May 16). Crores are spent to keep our netas out of harm?s way every year. Despite this, a few rowdy Congressmen managed to get their hands on Mukherjee at the party headquarters in Calcutta recently. This ugly incident could have been avoided if the minister?s securitymen went about doing their job properly. The government should take serious note of this incident and order an inquiry to ensure that the errant officers are pulled up for dereliction of duty.

 Yours faithfully,

Prashant Solomon, New Delhi

 Sir ? The treatment meted out to a senior and respected politician like Pranab Mukherjee by the supporters of his own party reflects the sorry state of affairs in West Bengal Congress. Party members are busy settling personal scores, that too at a time when municipal elections are round the corner. The incident is also a reminder of the infighting in West Bengal Pradesh Congress. The fact that the miscreants could get away with manhandling the defence minister of the country also goes to prove that the attack was endorsed by some powerful sections of the party.

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Sir ? Many Indians had taken a strong exception to the former defence minister, George Fernandes, being strip-searched by airport officials in the United States of America. Now, Pranab Mukherjee, the current defence minister, has been mobbed by his own partymen in his home state. The incident, which pointed to the party?s internal squabbles and tarnished its image, proves that ordinary Indians have little respect for the country?s defence minister. Can we really find fault with other nations ill treating our politicians when we ourselves are guilty of the same crime?

 Yours faithfully,

Neha Shah, Calcutta

 Sir ? Ordinary Indians have reasons to feel worried about Pranab Mukherjee getting beaten up by Congress workers in Calcutta. After all, is the country safe in the hands of a defence minister who is incapable of protecting himself? During the scuffle, Pranabbabu did attempt to fight off his assailants, but his punches missed their target, forcing him to launch a verbal attack on the assaulters instead. The Congress high command, quite expectedly, ordered an inquiry. But surprisingly, the defence minister has refused to attach much importance to the incident and absolved the offenders of any wrongdoing. A defence minister, who is willing to compromise with his assailants, is certainly not good news for the country?s security.

 Yours faithfully,

Diptimoy De, Calcutta

 Sir ?The attack on Pranab Mukherjee in the state Congress headquarters suggests that a sizeable section of party workers have an aversion to leaders who are unwilling to take on the left in West Bengal. Clearly, the Congress leaders hobnobbing with the communists in Delhi has not amused party workers in the states. With the Trinamool Congress being a spent force and the Congress in disarray, the Left Front government can be assured of a few more decades of uninterrupted rule in West Bengal.

 Yours faithfully,

Susobhan Sarkar, Calcutta

 Sir ? The fact that Pranab Mukherjee was punched and abused by party-workers only shows that the long tradition of heckling senior leaders is still very much alive in the Congress. Can a party, which cannot, or does not, extend adequate protection to its leaders, claim to meet the demands of the electorate if it were the win the civic polls?

 Yours faithfully,

Jayanta Datta, Hooghly

 Sir? The manhandling of Pranab Mukherjee by Congress workers is an indication that the state unit of the party is headed the Trinamool way. Now is a good time for Mamata Banerjee to trace her steps back to the parent party since there is hardly any difference left between the two.

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Das, Kharagpur

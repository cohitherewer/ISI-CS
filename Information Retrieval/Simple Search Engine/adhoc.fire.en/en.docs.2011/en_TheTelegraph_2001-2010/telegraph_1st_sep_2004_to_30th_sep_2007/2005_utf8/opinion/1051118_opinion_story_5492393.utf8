 The Communal Problem (National Book Trust, Rs 85) is the report of the six-member committee appointed by the Indian National Congress (Karachi Session, 1931) to enquire into the Kanpur riots of March 1931. The report is one of the earliest and most insightful analysis of the genesis and spread of communalism in India. It seeks to correct the notion that ?the Hindu-Muslim problem...is an age-old problem and that the two communities have, in their different religions and cultures, a source of inexhaustible and ineradicable antagonism which has made their mutual relations bitter, distrustful and hostile from the very outset?. The report argues that India, with its political unity in pieces and social fabric torn asunder by caste conflicts, was looking for a new synthesis in its religious and social life when Islam appeared on the scene. But historians do not care for this approach. ?The Muslim historian gloats over the discomfiture of the unbeliever and counts as his successes the treasure he collects, the temples he destroys, and the large number of kafirs he successfully sends to hell. The Hindu bemoans the loss of political power, the acts of religious vandalism, and the contamination of his religious and social life by the intrusion of the Mlechchhas. The Westerner laughs at them both and cleverly sets them one against the other.? 

 The Other Side of Me (HarperCollins, Rs 195) by Sidney Sheldon tells the story of the man who made a fortune telling stories. Sheldon describes, in his familiar, racy style, his own struggle to make an entry into Hollywood of the Thirties, working through the night writing stories for films and librettos for the musicals. The anecdotes, featuring Hollywood greats such as David Selznick, Groucho Marx, Cary Grant and others are delightful. Expectedly, not more than a few pages are devoted to his best-selling days. After all, struggle makes for a better story than success.

 No God in Sight (Penguin, Rs 195) by Altaf Tyrewala sets out to ?capture the collective consciousness of a city? through first-person accounts of an abortionist, a convert, a pregnant refugee, a gangster in hiding, a butcher, an apathetic CEO and others. With generous doses of terrorism, communal tension, sexual profligacy delivered in ?Indian? English, the novel looks set to be made into a film starring Rahul Bose.

 Critics beware

This Above All / Khushwant Singh

Rising passions

 ?The very name evokes awe and reverence,? writes Sinjita Gupta, translator and compiler of ten short stories by Rabindranath Tagore in a collection entitled Mystic Moods.

 To love and reverence, when it comes to assessing his worth as a writer of fiction, I add a third word, trepidation. I burnt my fingers once when I questioned Tagore?s standing as a novelist and short-story writer. I was mobbed at Calcutta airport by a group of young boys, none of whom, I am certain, had read anything written by Tagore. They had been put up by someone who was incensed at my audacity to criticize Bengal?s greatest icon. After that experience I discuss Tagore only with Bengali friends who are knowledgeable and are able to make a balanced assessment. 

 Having a worshipful attitude towards a writer, however eminent, is not the way to judge his merits. No one questions Tagore?s pre-eminence as a poet and writer of songs. There is also something uncanny and powerful about his paintings. I cannot make up my mind about him as a playwright. But I have no doubts in my mind about him as a novelist and a short-story writer. I do not rate him very high: Bengal has produced quite a few better than him. I am confirmed in my views after going through Mystic Moods. 

 All the stories are contrived and unrealistic; quite a few are ghost stories and not one character comes to life. Part of this can be explained by his penchant for making one of his characters the narrator in the oral tradition of story-telling, and he starts by saying, ?Listen to this one!? And you listen to what he says because he is sitting in front of you. That does not hold good when the tale is put down on paper.

 To add to the readers? woes, Sinjita Gupta?s translations do not read well. Despite her academic qualifications and her scholastic pedigree, her rendering of gurudev?s prose varies between the purple and the banal. However, one also gets the uneasy feeling that there is little substance in the original.

 I would like people to read this collection if only to refute what I am saying. I am pretty certain that if these stories were sent to any publisher today under a name other than Rabindranath Tagore?s, they would be returned with a polite rejection slip.

 Madness in the moon

 The tsunami killer tidal wave occurred on December 26 last year, taking a heavy toll of human lives and property. Scientists tell us that it was caused by an earthquake measuring 9 on the Richter scale, caused by shifting of earth plates under the ocean. It also happened on the night of the full moon. We know the moon has a gravitational pull on the earth which causes high tides. Was this a mere co-incidence or did the full moon contribute to the disaster?

 Scientists and doctors have examined the data collected on the subject. It is believed that the full moon affects human behaviour and makes many temporarily insane. This myth was based on the fact that more than half of all human and animals bodies are made of water. If the moon can make the waters of oceans rise, it may well do the same to the water in human and animal bodies. After examining hundreds of case-histories, it has been established that it does nothing of the sort. It does not effect the flow of streams or rivers nor make the slightest impact on lakes and water in tanks and ponds. Marginal increases in number of people bitten by dogs, cats, rats and horses has been recorded but not enough to link them to the full moon.

 Moon myths began centuries ago and persist to this day despite the fact that because of widespread electric lighting, few of us now get to see the full moon in all its glory! It is best to leave the moon to poets, lovers and newly married couples. The rest is moonshine.

 You get the leader you deserve

 Laloo?s charm is known world-wide

 Even Pakistan is on his side;

His chuckle, his gibe, his humour, his wit 

 His arrogance, intolerance, 

 articulation, grit

And his popularity and perversity are a matter fit

 For epic treatment of comic content

If only its consequences were not tragic,

If only Bihar were not a benighted state

A land of anarchy, ransom, mafia rule

Where security is the luxury of only the fool,

Where he has given a tongue to the people

Where he can be a cause of secular pride

For beating back the communal tide though,

 He has nothing to show

Except tattered roads and kidnapped engineers

He?s a man of the people, a messiah of the poor

 But with his reputation for 

 corruption, his note distribution

 Is he not on their name

 A big slur!

 And if he disgraces the leadership of 

 the downtrodden

 Won?t he have to a noble cause

 A nasty service done?

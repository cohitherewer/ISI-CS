 Extracts from a study on the response of the tribal communities of Jharia coalfield to the pulse polio immunization programme

 As the survey was conducted in rural areas (villages) in the district and urban areas were not included in the survey, the findings are applicable only to rural areas of Dhanbad district.

 The ?Pulse Polio Immunization? programme reached 75-100 per cent of the eligible children in the surveyed villages in the sense that they received at least one dose under PPI Programme. The relevant average for the district was more than 90 per cent.

 However, the percentage of fully immunized children (who had received a minimum of 3 doses of polio vaccine...) ranged widely from 14.8 to 94.5 per cent of eligible children in the surveyed villages with the district average at about 56 per cent...The percentage of ?Not immunized children? varied from 0-25 per cent, with the district average at 9.5 per cent.

 The status of immunization may be quantified by the twin parameters of percentages of fully immunized children and percentages of children with ?Nil immunization?. The status of immunization may be more conveniently quantified by the index of immunization, which takes ?Not immunized?, ?Partially immunized? and ?Fully immunized? children into consideration.

 On all the counts there is no significant difference between tribal children as compared to scheduled castes and other children. The status of immunization of Muslim children is however significantly inferior.

 Immunization of children against polio is necessary at a very early age as the onset of the disease in more than 60 per cent of the cases occurs before 2 years of age or earlier. The findings of the present survey show that immunizations have started much late as more than 70 per cent of the children are not being given the first dose till 11 months of age. Even by 23 months of age, less than 25 per cent of the children are being fully immunized, which means a majority of children are partially or wholly unprotected during the most vulnerable period of their life. Impact of Poor Routing Polio Immunization (RPI) on status of immunization: The complete absence or inadequate presence of RPI has contributed to low status of immunization in many villages and generally is responsible for increasing the age at which a child becomes fully immunized. More than 85 per cent of the children were fully immunized in two villages where all the children ... had received RPI doses.

 This points strongly to the possible remedial measure of giving more stress on RPI along with the PPI programme.

 LOCAL TRIUMPH

 The large turnout in the civic polls in Jammu and Kashmir suggests that there is a widespread urge for peace and stability among the people. These elections come after a gap of 27 years, and have been postponed several times in the past few years. Even the present elections were saved from being derailed by an intervention from the prime minister. It is important now to ensure that there is a real decentralization of authority which can contribute to better governance at the grassroots level. The huge turnout is particularly welcome, as it has happened despite militants? threat and attacks and an active boycott campaign by separatist organizations. For example, in Baramulla and Kupwara districts, once strongholds of militants, the turnout was more than 70 per cent. Indeed, in the municipal committees in Kupwara, it reached 86 per cent, while in Hundwara, nearly 88 per cent of the electorate exercised their franchise. This happened in spite of the All Party Hurriyat Conference?s strident campaign against the elections. Individual separatist leaders like Mr Yasin Malik and Mr Shabir Shah also called for a boycott of the polls. Moreover, militant outfits like the Hizbul Mujahedin and Al Mansoorian had threatened the candidates and even attacked and killed a few of them. 

 All this did not deter the Kashmiris from voting. The results reflect a growing desire for better governance and a huge sentiment against violence. The ruling coalition of the Congress and the People?s Democratic Party swept the first phase of the civic elections in Baramulla and Kupwara, while the opposition, National Conference, gave a poor showing. Independent candidates too won several seats. Greater financial autonomy and power to legislate on local issues are essential if the local bodies have to carry weight. Political alienation in Jammu and Kashmir has been accentuated by a near total disconnection of the people from the instruments of political power and policy formulation. True grassroots empowerment requires strong local bodies that are responsive and responsible. Good governance and development may not be the ultimate answer to the problems of Kashmir but they can at least create conditions which will make it possible for more imaginative political initiatives to take place.

 WHERE CREDIT IS DUE

 S. Venkitaramanan

 Over the past few years, the Reserve Bank of India?s credit policy statements have lost the mystique that surrounded them in previous decades. The transparency and the effective policy communications which the RBI governor makes over the year have made it possible for economists to anticipate the RBI?s policy stance from time to time. There is, of course, a possibility that the central bank may exercise its privilege to surprise the markets. This time however, the governor, Y.V. Reddy, has not yielded to the temptation to accommodate anti-inflation hawks who had suggested that he should increase the interest rates and curb liquidity. In the RBI?s latest policy, the governor has let the bank rate and the cash reserve ratio remain unaltered. He has noted that inflation has not been much higher than expected in spite of the oil price rise, that it is intrinsically a supply-induced phenomenon and monthly actions per se can do little to contain it. 

 The governor?s statement is along expected lines. It notes that inflation, which peaked in October 2004, has been declining steadily, partly owing to accommodative fiscal measures by the government to insulate the Indian consumer from the global oil price rise. There is, however, a very heavy fiscal price to pay for these lollypops to the petro-products consumer. Oil public sector units are going into the red massively and the government?s fiscal deficit increases to the extent their contribution to the revenue decreases. 

 This will indirectly lead to inflation. The governor has, however, wisely stayed away from this politically explosive topic and not lectured the government on the inappropriateness of shielding consumers. 

 The downsides

 The governor notes that there has been considerable improvement in reserves. However, the current account has turned into a deficit in spite of export increases of roughly 27 per cent during the last year. Imports have also risen substantially, reflecting the growth of investment and industrial demand. The growing current account deficit, which poses a burden on the balance of payments, may be a reflection of the growing pains of the economy. It is, however, gratifying to note that ?invisible? receipts, such as remittances from non-resident Indians and software exports, have helped us bridge it. In addition, the substantial inflows from foreign institutional investors and foreign direct investors have led to an accretion to the reserves.

 The credit policy reiterates that the exchange rate policy will be guided by the broad principles of careful monitoring and management of exchange rate flexibility without a fixed target or a pronounced band. The successful management of India?s foreign exchange situation over the years has shown that the RBI has been doing it right.

 All in all, the RBI?s credit policy is a salutary initiative which bridges the conflicting imperatives of economic growth and inflation management. 

 It goes without saying that fiscal management is still the crux of our problems. With the best of the governor?s initiatives, if fiscal deficit continues to drive government borrowing out of kilter, it may be difficult to maintain a benign interest rate environment as government demand presses on bank resources. While investment for infrastructure must be encouraged, the same does not hold good for revenue deficits, which are essentially consumption-oriented. It is time Reddy focuses on the quality of government deficit, which his efficient gilt operations help finance at lower costs. But he can do it only for the medium term. Ultimately, the financial system will creak under the pressure of government demand for funds on top of the industry?s requirements. One or the other will have to give. That will be a test of Reddy?s innovativeness and on its success will rest India?s economic future.

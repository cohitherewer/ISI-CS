 FALLING SHORT OF TOTAL REVOLUTION

 A new government in Bihar is unlikely to effect a substantial change in the ground realities in the state, argues Sumanta Sen

 Ways of their world

 The results of the election in Bihar will be known on February 27. For the last one month, the media have gone to town with the question, ?Is this the end of the road for Laloo Yadav and Rabri Devi?? and have generally suggested that Bihar?s answer may well be in the affirmative. The media cannot be blamed as on the face of it, there is no reason why the Rashtriya Janata Dal should be voted back to power. Elections, however, are a tricky business. Votes are not always cast along expected lines and as things stand, Laloo Prasad Yadav may still have the last laugh.

 What if he does not emerge on top and some other combination takes over? Will that mean a change in the scenario that Bihar has been witnessing not only for the last fifteen years but from long before that? If it is assumed that a change in the government will lead to a slight change in the scenario, then it is a wrong assumption. Bihar shall remain where it is, and not only because the players on the other side are no better. There cannot be any change because the ills that plague the state have not been created by any individual, these are deeply rooted in the state?s social life. Feudalism cannot be uprooted by any election.

 Bihar is not the only place where change appears to be almost impossible. The situation is the same in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh ? the Hindi heartland, the BIMARU block. Changes in terms of political colour have taken place in Bhopal, Jaipur and Lucknow, but have people felt the change? In other parts of the country, changes, however little, have taken place but not in the land of stagnation along which flows the Ganga. So why blame Bihar alone?

 There are various reasons that can be cited for this, but perhaps the most important one lies in a contradiction. For the last fifty years, Bihar has sunk into its own mess, but at the same time, individual Biharis have excelled. Bihar has not only sent ministers with more-than-average competence to the Centre, the all-India service list for any year shows a large number of Biharis featuring in it. Thus Bihar has always had a presence in the national scene. And perhaps it is this that causes the rest of the country to wonder why individual excellence has not been translated into a collective effort for a better life?

 The problem always has been that these individuals have never tried to even think of a change in their home base, because the status quo has suited them. They have always been part of a feudal gentry, reaping rich harvests from the fertile land, secure in the loyalties of their ?caste men?. Living in their posh bungalows in Patna, they did not, and still do not, see any reason why the applecart should be disturbed, particularly because they themselves can take advantage of the facilities of education, health and employment for their children in other cities and other countries. Yes, they are aware of the mess that is all around them but why should they bother as long as the mess worked to their advantage?

 Caste, for instance. Everybody in Patna speaks against it and almost everybody is at the same time keen to ensure that caste remains a socially binding force. There was great consternation when the late Karpoori Thakur came into office. Years later, Tarakeswari Sinha, wailed before this writer, ?Caste has always been a part of life in Bihar but casteism was introduced by Karpooriji?. She was obviously referring to the rise of the backward classes but she ought to have known that there was no cause for worry. Karpooriji?s disciple, Laloo Yadav, and others have seen to it that caste considerations remain the principal driving force. In fact, their brand of socialism sees nothing wrong in this. Whatever may be said at the time of the polls, the whole of Bihar?s elite is happy that the ?rise of the backwards? has not led to any break-up of the social fabric of their choice.

 That the status quo needs to be maintained, is the prayer in every heart. Take the various senas, the armed brigands of landlords, which are entrusted with the responsibility of maintaining class and caste domination in the countryside. 

 Publicly, Patna expresses its indignation at the murderous ways of these people but privately, there is always an attempt to impress on the outsider the argument that ?after all, they are also needed as who else is there to keep away the dacoits?? The ?dacoits? almost invariably are the poor, who seek to raise their voices against oppression and are often backed by leftists looking beyond the parliamentary path. The senas of the Rajputs and the Yadavs may clash against each other but essentially they are united against the common enemy. Everybody, including the administration, is happy that the status quo is maintained.

 Feudalism is sustained not just by muscle power but also with the help of unbridled corruption at the top, which again is its own creation. 

 And there is hardly any social protest. Forget the politicians, the lavish houses owned by even middle-level bureaucrats could not have been built with white money. Many own more than one, and hence the expression, ?makaan mafia?. No eyebrows are raised because practically everybody in what should have been the socially vocal section has a finger in the pie.

 In the mid-Seventies, Jayaprakash Narayan had given the call for a ?total revolution?. Whatever he himself might have meant by it, Narayan clearly did not have a road map. His young followers in Bihar thought it was a call for anarchy and between them they too have created an anarchic situation. The task was made easy by the fact that socially, the grounds for anarchy already existed. 

 Today these followers are operating under different brand names but they are actually all the same. They may be Yadavs, Kurmis or Dalits but essentially they are all engaged in the successful staging of a farce. And what is particularly sickening is that they have also succeeded in convincing the suffering poor that they are also bit players in this once-in-five-year stage production.

 Laloo Yadav?s famous quip is, ?Samosa mein aloo, Bihar mein Laloo?. He is only partly right. If he is not there, it will be no great loss to the samosa as there are other aloos keen to step into his shoes. The samosa will taste the same.

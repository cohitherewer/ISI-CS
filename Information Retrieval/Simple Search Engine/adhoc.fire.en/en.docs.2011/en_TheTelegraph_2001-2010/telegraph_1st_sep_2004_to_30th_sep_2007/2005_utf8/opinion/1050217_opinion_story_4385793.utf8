 SAFE RETURN TO ROOTS

 Gouri Chatterjee

 There was a time when Rathikant Basu took pride in saying, ?I am a Gujarati.? He was a Gujarat cadre IAS officer then who, as boss of Doordarshan, was shaking up the nation?s TV viewing habits.

 Now, as a businessman, he still insists his Gujarati is better than his Bengali. Maybe, but he has surely honed up on his mother tongue too. He has also set up house in Calcutta (though home is still in Mumbai) and he is all set to launch the first Bengali news channel on Monday, February 21, Bangladesh?s bhasha divas.

 As boss of Tara, Bengal has long been on Basu?s radar but that could have been a good Gujju?s business instincts rising. Bengalis love their TV, Basu had learnt in 1995, when he started DD-7, the first satellite channel in Bengali. 

 When he turned entrepreneur ten years or so later, Bengal was part of Basu?s Tara bouquet of regional channels. Soon, Bengali was all that his company, Broadcast Worldwide, was putting on the airwaves. But even he hadn?t dared dream of an all-news Bengali channel before. 

 And now, Tara News will enjoy the first-mover advantage for a few months at best. Surjo, Tamil channel Sun TV?s first foray north of the Vindhyas, will be here in April. Star News is busy training its freshly recruited staff for its Bangla channel while Subroto Roy?s Sahara Samay has threatened to turn to Bengal once it?s done with Bihar, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Delhi by February end. Who knows, Prannoy Roy may rediscover his roots soon.

 It must be their genes kicking in. That would explain why it has taken them so long to foresee an opportunity in Bengali news channels. The Hindi-wallahs, the Southies spotted theirs ages ago. The Babus waited for the figures from Television Audience Measurement (TAM) India, the country?s arbiter of viewing tastes, to come in. 

 What goes up... 

 Calcutta, that data showed, watches the most TV after Chennai, it has a marked preference for programmes in Bengali, it gives in general much higher ratings to non-fiction programmes (so that all Bengali channels have several hours of news and current affairs programmes already), it loves programmes that take on the high and mighty of the land. Things one would have known if he knew his fellow Bengalis better, but whoever relies upon such ?unscientific? research these days. 

 The imminent boom in Bengali news channels seems entirely data-driven. If numbers showed there were viewers for news, there were other numbers that showed there was a market too. The total ad pie for Hindi new channels has grown exponentially since the 2003 news channel explosion and now commands more ads than even the movie channels. Add to this Calcutta?s visible consumption boom and voila, Bengal is the place to be in 2005 for news channels. 

 But in their birth could lie the seeds of their destruction, i.e. low TRPs. Those who play so safe can hardly be expected to tread on toes, make enemies or take sides, that is purvey news that will make us sit up and take note. In other words, so many channels may not be such great news after all. It is only the language that will be different, the rest will be the regulation diet of headlines laced with chat shows and crime watches that we are so familiar (and bored) with. 

 But it is the in-your-face, take-no-prisoners style of Khoj Khabar (and Khash Khabar earlier) that sends TRPs soaring. And raise expectations of a thriving demand for news channels here. Maybe Bengalis are like that only. But who cares? Media decisions are not taken from the bottom up these days. News outlets are not meant to address felt needs, they are supposed to cater to a ?market?. And when the market refuses to deliver, the judgment will be, ?You can?t do business in Bengal.?

 BAD FOR THE SOUL

 Man?s ingenuity is matter for pure wonder. One of the most amazing petitions to the Supreme Court recently has suggested that newspapers be graded, that is, rated and labelled as films are, according to content. Some films are for adults only, while others are for universal viewing, with an occasional one carrying the ?parental guidance? rating. The petitioner, to go by the content of the petition, is deeply concerned about the danger to the morals of minors, who might, presumably, be corrupted by jokes with ?pornographic content? as well as by items relating to sex ? which, with scant regard to the meaning of words, have been called ?prurient? matter. The intricate twists and turns of such moralities are difficult to straighten out. Part of the argument relates to mechanics: films, television and the internet can be turned off, newspapers invade the home. A part relates to a discovery of the evils of freedom of speech: it is this that forces individuals to accept newspapers in their homes ? evidently the simple expedient of not buying newspapers does not occur to them. This last is then related to a concern about the dominance of commercial values in recent times, which, apparently, leads directly to the publication of ?titillating material?. And so on.

 The petition, with its disarming lack of sophistication and clear thinking, merely succeeds in bringing up an older debate, that about the value of rating anything as adult and non-adult. For many, this very exercise is puerile: the aspiration to separate the adult from the minor by forcing children to watch only those films that are supposed to be good for them is quite silly. To look at it in another way, it is a display of a lack of confidence ? in the adults who bring up their children, in the education system fostered by the same authorities who are shaky about evil influences ? as well as an unspoken fear about how the inequities of society affect cultural development. The petition seems to suggest that there should be some newspapers not with news, but with ?titillating? tidbits, and others with ?clean? ?feel-good? items ? the principle of film censorship is that both sex and violence are bad. It is sad that the Supreme Court should have to deal with such petitions. In a country where the backlog of cases is so enormous, surely it is a waste of time.

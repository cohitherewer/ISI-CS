 ON THE TRACKS OF DRACULA

 The elusive one 

 The Historian

 By Elizabeth Kostova, 

 Little, Brown, pound; 4.75

 Count Dracula has continued to hold a strange fascination since the time of Bram Stoker?s 1897 eponymous novel. This novel, as its name would suggest, attempts to situate Dracula in history and to link it with the medieval ruler, Vlad the Impaler.

 The novel flits through time and geography. It begins in Amsterdam with a very sweet relationship between a former history professor, Paul, and his motherless daughter. The father always takes his daughter with him when he travels across Europe to lecture or to attend conferences. The daughter, intelligent and precocious, begins to notice that certain places in the Balkans, or a monastery in southern France, makes her father introspective, frightened and distracted. She begins to question her father and to investigate his library.

 In the library, she discovers an old book with a dragon in the middle and a bunch of old letters written in 1930 from Trinity College, Oxford, beginning ?My dear and unfortunate successor?. The letters and the father?s response to his daughter?s questions lead to one strand of the story. The story is that of Professor Rossi who was the father?s supervisor in an old US university. Rossi was an authority on vampire legends and on Dracula. One day he disappeared. Just before his disappearance, he had heard from Paul about how a book with the picture of a dragon had appeared on his library table out of nowhere. Rossi had confessed that he too had received such a book many years ago.

 Rossi?s disappearance starts Paul off on his own quest. He meets Helen who claims to be Rossi?s daughter, born of an affair he had in Romania. They begin to look for Rossi. The search takes them to Istanbul, to Hungary and to Romania. They meet Helen?s mother and Paul receives from her the bunch of old letters which begin with those strange words.

 This much the daughter learns from her father until, during one visit to Oxford, Paul disappears with a note to his daughter asking her to go back to Amsterdam and saying that he would be back in a few days. In Amsterdam, looking through her father?s library, she discovers a long letter written for her by her father. She can figure out from this letter where her father has gone and why. She decides to follow her father. An Oxford undergraduate, Barley, her chaperone from Oxford, chooses to go with her.

 This becomes the daughter?s story. The common thread running through Rossi?s story told via his letters, Paul?s and Helen?s story, and the daughter?s story ? the daughter is also the narrator of the novel ? is Dracula.

 The supernatural stalks realistic descriptions in the novel. The pace is fast; and locales change swiftly. The narrative is steeped in history, myth and legends, but the scholarship is lightly worn. The denouement is a trifle bizarre but that doesn?t take away from the attractions of the novel.

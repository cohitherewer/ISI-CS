 NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE

 Roger Federer has moved smoothly into the space left by Pete Sampras, writes Satrujit Banerjee

 Staying motivated

 In last Sunday?s US Open finals, Andre Agassi played just as well as he has played for the rest of his glittering career, and yet lost in four sets to Roger Federer. For those who follow tennis closely, this confirms what former players, commentators and critics have been saying for the last year or so ? that in Federer we have an all-time great. There is little doubt that by the time he hangs up his racket, unless there are injuries, he will be bracketed with the Lavers, the Samprases and the very best of yesteryear.

 Federer?s credentials are already impressive. He hasn?t lost any of the six Grand Slam finals he has played, and in none of them was the play ever extended to the fifth set. This year his win-loss record is 71-3, and in the process, he has broken Pete Sampras?s Open-era record by winning 35 consecutive matches on hardcourts. His last loss in a final came on July 13, 2003, when he was beaten by Jiri Novak in Gstaad, Switzerland. Since then he has won 23 finals. The previous record for consecutive victories in finals was 12, held jointly by Bjorn Borg and John McEnroe. Of the 23 of Federer?s finals, 16 were on hard court, four on grass and three on clay. He is the first in the 37-year Open era to win the Wimbledon and US Open back-to-back in consecutive years. He also reached the semi-finals at the other two Grand Slam events this year, the Australian Open and the French Open.

 Former players are unanimous in their praise. Richard Krajicek feels, ?Federer is so good because he has no weakness in his game. With Sampras, you somehow felt you could attack his backhand. Not so with Federer.? Boris Becker stated, ?Federer?s greatness lies in the fact that he is equally good from the baseline as well as at the net?, and John McEnroe declared, ? (He) is the most complete tennis player I have ever seen. Period.? But perhaps the most telling comment came from Agassi after losing last Sunday?s final, which was his eighth straight loss to Federer. He said, ?It is disappointing to lose, but the first thing you have to assess is why you did lose and I just lost to a guy who?s better...He?s the best I?ve played against?. He went on to say, ?He?s the only guy I?ve ever played against where you hold serve to go 1-0, and you?re thinking ?All right! Good!??, getting a laugh from his audience. ?And I?m not just making fun of it. I?m literally telling you the way it is. He can hurt you at any point.? 

 Agassi should know. When he was leading 4-2 in the third set after splitting the first two, he may have had visions of a third singles title at the Open. But in the seventh game, at 30-30 on Agassi?s serve, Federer produced consecutive winners to break his serve. The set went to a tie-break. Agassi won the first point on his serve. Then Federer reeled off the next seven points, taking a 2-1 set lead. In the fourth set, Federer raced to a 5-0 lead before Agassi held serve.

 Federer?s initiation into tennis was on the slow clay courts in Switzerland. It is on these courts that he honed his skills. This explains why he is comfortable playing from well beyond the baseline. During his formative years, Federer?s idols were Boris Becker and Stefan Edberg, both renowned for their net play and copybook volleys. 

 It is to Federer?s credit that he spent long hours perfecting this art. This, coupled with his natural ability, has turned him into the best volleyer of the present generation. He is among a rare breed of tennis players who are equally at ease behind the baseline as well as at the net.

 To prove that he is no flash in the pan, Federer will have to accomplish a couple of milestones. He has to win the only Grand Slam that has eluded him till now ? the French Open title ? and come close to, if not beat, Sampras?s magical figure of 14 Grand Slam singles titles. 

 It will be injudicious to bet against Federer winning the French Open. His clay court game is of the highest order and it is not a surface he loathes, as Sampras did. Reaching the semi-final round of this year?s French Open is a case in point. In fact, he has chosen the slow clay surface to play the home Davis Cup relegation-round tie against Great Britain in Geneva starting next week. 

 As for the second milestone, Federer is understandably reluctant to publicly make breaking Sampras?s record a career objective. But the two match up fairly well. Sampras won seven majors before he was 25. Federer, who turned 24 last month, has six. Half of Sampras?s seven Grand Slams have come at Wimbledon. So has Federer?s ? 3 out of 6. Like Sampras, Federer will continue to remain among the favourites to win there as long as he is fit to play. So a total of 8 Grand Slams in the next 5 years is not improbable.

 In an interview with Christopher Clarey of the New York Times on the day after the US Open finals, Federer said, ?I have the feeling that I went through a lot as a boy with my career, lots of ups and downs. Finally I?m at the top, and people ask, ?How can you stay motivated ?? I?m really in the mood to achieve more. I enjoy winning. I enjoy playing in front of the crowd. I like that challenge. I like to take on the other guys. I don?t like to hide. I could sit at home and be No. 1 in the world and look at other guys and say, ?You battle it out, and I?ll come when it really matters.?... I enjoy travelling the world and playing. So for me, so far, it is not something I?m questioning inside me?. This reveals a healthy love and respect for the game which will translate into keeping Federer shipshape for quite some time now.

 Roger Federer has moved seamlessly into the larger-than-life space left by Pete Sampras after his retirement. As Agassi said after the finals, ?Pete was great; I mean no question. But there was a place to get to with Pete. You knew what you had to do. If you do it, it could be on your terms. There is no such place with Roger?.

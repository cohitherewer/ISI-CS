 THINK SMALL TO MAKE IT BIG

 Mixed bag

 Some Indian publishers-cum-distributors borrow their ideas from the big conglomerates without any consideration for our market conditions to such an extent that they fall flat within a few years. Take for instance, the attempt to provide everything under one roof like some kind of a supermarket for books: from educational books to books on science, technology, medicine, entertainment, general fiction, reference books and so on.

 This broad canvas works in the West because there are separate divisions for every category, each autonomous with their own marketing teams and profit centres. They don?t here because our infrastructure is too limited to handle such a vast quantity of books on different subjects. Just how deep is the crisis will be seen soon when there will be cutbacks in publishing programmes of the ?big? houses, along with overhead costs in warehousing, downsizing and generally all-round cuts in frills, like launch parties during the release of each new book.

 Hotchpotch publishing programmes don?t work because the publisher isn?t identified with any particular line(s) of publishing: the market can?t figure out what the publisher is up to and the in-house sales and marketing teams don?t know where to take their mixed bag of titles to. The cost of sales goes up which cuts into profits.

 With increasing specialization, what brings in results are small, clearly-defined niche markets that cater to their needs with low operating costs. By concentrating on a critical mass, overhead costs are automatically cut down.

 However, cross-fertilization of trends continue. Business and Spirituality? Health and Multimedia? Religion and Multiculturalism? There can be any number of combinations and permutations but there has to be a core area around which titles can be spun around.

 Take spiritual and inspirational themes or issues of morality and values that are striking a chord these days. Spirituality encompasses a wide-ranging field, from doctrinal theology to books geared to address the spiritual needs of people ? whether it is the concerns of the ageing population, the perceived breakdown of social order or the approaching end of the millennium, people are searching for meaning and purpose of their lives. These books sell because publishers have stuck to a particular niche and haven?t strayed off in different directions.

 Mixing spirituality and health is a winning combination. Holistic approaches to spiritual, mental and physical health have proved extremely popular. Here again, it is the niche approach that has brought in results. What many Indian publishers don?t realize is that there are far too many books and there isn?t enough space in bookshops to stock and display them and that readers don?t have the time to spend on books of peripheral interest. So, stick to the straight and narrow path of niche markets.

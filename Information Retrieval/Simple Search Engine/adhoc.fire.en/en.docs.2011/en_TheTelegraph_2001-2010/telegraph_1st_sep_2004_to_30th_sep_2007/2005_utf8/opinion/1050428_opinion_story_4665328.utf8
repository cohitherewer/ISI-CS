 Letters to Editor

 Beyond belief

 Sir ? Some amount of belief in oneself is essential to get through life, but too much of it can be disastrous. Zahira Sheikh must realize that by accusing the Supreme Court of bias, she is simply harming her case (?Zahira lobs ?bias? slur on SC panel?, April 21). Already, she has lost a lot of public sympathy by flip-flopping over her version of how 14 members of her family died in the Best Bakery carnage. If this 20-year old girl from a conservative Muslim background is to be believed, everyone ? the Gujarat courts, the Mumbai special courts, Teesta Setalvad ? is wrong. Only she is to be believed. People must believe her that at one point she was pressurized by a certain set of people to say one thing, and then some time later, pressurized by another set of people to say something completely at odds. But there are limits to people?s credulity, even if there seems to be no limits to Zahira?s own.

 Yours faithfully,

M. Banerjee, Calcutta 

 A fair deal

 Sir ? It is heartening to learn that the government plans to take up a massive programme to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering (?Science in search of women?, April 25 ). But before embarking on such a project, it would be worthwhile to find out why women who are already in these professions have not made it to the middle levels, let alone the top. The reality is that women?s progress depends on the men sitting on various committees, who are either full of gender bias or more interested in the way they look rather than their potential as scientists. The various selection committees I have faced have, more often than not, quizzed me about my family, what make-up I use, and my hobbies, instead of assessing my qualification for the job. The scene here is murkier even than the world of glamour. The sad but true fact is that a well-dressed, albeit dull woman stands a better chance of rising than a demure but intelligent plain Jane. Also, a woman with an influential husband or boyfriend is more likely to make it. 

 Before starting work on the new programme, it would be better to address the grievances of these women who have been pushed to a corner. 

 Yours faithfully,

Preeti Chandra, Kharagpur

 Sir ? Completion of PhD coincides with the childbearing age of women, which makes if difficult for them to pursue a research career full-time right from the start. Most people settle down with a teaching job as a compromise. If the government allows part-time working for about three years, I am sure it will be very helpful.

 Yours faithfully,

Sudarshana Saha, Bristol 

 Sir ? Projecting role models and offering incentives may not be enough to encourage women to take up science ? the problem has deeper implications. Studies show that women avoid success in male-dominated fields because they perceive it to be antithetical to feminine characteristics. Competition, independence, competence, intellectual achievement and leadership reflect positively on masculinity but are thought to be inconsistent with femininity. Thus most women are chary of achieving success in science, which is considered to be a male domain in India, as they fear negative consequences like social rejection. Studies abroad show that women increasingly develop a fear of success as they grow older. 

 Take the attitude to the higher education of women. No one in urban India objects to a woman going to university, provided the objective is to make her generally accomplished and a more interesting and enlightened companion, wife and mother. The social problems arise only when the individual?s objectives become more personal and career-oriented, especially in gender stereotyped areas like science. Hence unless the core issue is addressed, the government and academics may find themselves frustrated. In this regard, one may recall the controversy over the comments Lawrence Summers of Harvard University made on the subject recently. The glass ceiling may not be as brittle as it appears.

 Yours faithfully,

Sekhar Basu Mallik, Calcutta

 Sir ? Bedashruti Mitra?s letter, ?What women want to study? (April 25), arguing against reservations for women was like a breath of fresh air. We have a different generation now which doesn?t need pity from the government but believes in itself.

 Yours faithfully,

Abhijit Das, Singapore

 Parting shot

 Sir ? What a joke! A fashion designer ? a glorified tailor really ? crying foul over another designer allegedly copying a dress made by him (?Copycat charges cast shadow on the catwalk?, April 26). Nobody grudges if these designers take advantage of a few rich but culturally poor people and become famous. There was a time when items of clothing, like the ?Jahar-coat,? attained fame for the persons who wore it. It was copied by other tailors and worn by everyone without a murmur of dissent. But now, it appears, nothing less than a patent will do.

 Yours faithfully,

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta

 NO RETURN

 In any other state, the event should have been a cause for celebration. But Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee returned from his tour of Singapore and Jakarta to find himself in the thick of controversies. The facts are much simpler than the controversies would suggest. Here is a state that failed to attract investments, thanks mainly to the archaic and obstructionist policies of the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist). After several decades, things began to change, as new political and economic realities forced the Marxists to change their ways. Mr Bhattacharjee captured the spirit of change much more than his party. And the investors responded by changing their perceptions of the state. The large investments that he has managed to win for Bengal from top Indonesian and Singaporean companies should have inspired great expectations. The success of his mission holds the hope for a new dawn in Bengal. Some of his statements during the trip show how far ahead he is of his own party in pushing economic reforms. A rare realism marks his emphasis on the role of foreign direct investment in reviving Bengal?s economy. The CPI(M), which was totally opposed to FDI, has come to partially accept it. What Bengal?s chief minister has said is clearly the way forward. It is a matter of time before the party too accepts it. The trouble is that the sceptics within the party could slow down Bengal?s ? and India?s ? economic progress. 

 But a bogus controversy has broken out over the question of using agricultural land for new industries or the special economic zone to be built by the Salim group of Indonesia. Agricultural or otherwise, land is valuable only if the returns from it make economic sense. It is no secret that farming alone can no longer sustain the rural economy in Bengal. Even so, given the stage of the state?s economic development, agriculture will continue to be a major source of livelihood for the majority of the people. Mr Bhattacharjee has rightly stressed the importance of farming in ensuring the state?s food security. But that cannot mean that land would not be made available for new industrial or urbanization projects. History is a record of how economies move from agriculture to industry and how people graduate from rural to urban livelihoods. It would be tragic for the state if the momentum is lost. Those who cling to the past are betraying the cause of Bengal?s future.

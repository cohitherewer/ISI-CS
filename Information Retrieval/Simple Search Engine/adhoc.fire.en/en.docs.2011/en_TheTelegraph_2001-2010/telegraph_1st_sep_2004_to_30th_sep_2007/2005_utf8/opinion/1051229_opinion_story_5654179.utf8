 MORE TO SHOW

 Corporate India is in the grip of a merger and acquisitions frenzy. Scarcely a day passes without an Indian company announcing an acquisition abroad. What?s more, takeovers of companies abroad are no longer confined to IT or pharma firms ? in recent weeks, there have been acquisitions of chemical companies, textile firms, steel companies, auto-ancillary units, apart from companies in the software and pharmaceutical industries. Equally varied are the reasons behind the acquisition spree. First and foremost, of course, is the need for Indian companies to ramp up their scale of operations quickly. With growth being robust, corporate organizations feel that they need to build capacity quickly and M amp;As are the obvious way to make the most of the opportunity. It also helps that Indian companies are flush with cash, and capital is cheap, ensuring that lack of resources do not stand in the way of good deals. As a matter of fact, private equity funds are bulging with money, and they have been one of the main drivers of M amp;A deals globally this year. The search for global markets has led Indian firms to set up shop in places like eastern Europe, to access the huge European market. Other reasons include the increasingly desperate search to sew up raw material resources, which has led Indian companies to acquire stakes in coal and copper mines, and has driven the Oil and Natural Gas Commission?s hunt for oil resources. In other instances, companies have bought companies that give them access to technology or to brands. Similarly, foreign companies too have been keen to buy Indian companies as it gives them access to the rapidly growing Indian market, and although the number of such acquisitions has been small, they have bought into some very large companies.

 Clearly, cross-border M amp;A activity is a barometer of the degree of integration of the Indian economy with the rest of the world. As the barriers to foreign investment are removed, and Indian companies become part and parcel of global supply chains, the number of deals too will rise. In fact, a KPMG survey on M amp;A found that the number of deals in India has increased by 52 per cent over 2004. By number of deals, India was the fifth most targeted nation and the seventh most active acquirer in Asia in 2005. Nevertheless, with deal value at around $10 billion this year, India?s share in global M amp;A activity was a mere one per cent. That indicates the huge potential that exists for M amp;As in this country. It is no surprise therefore that investment bankers are so keen on the Indian market.

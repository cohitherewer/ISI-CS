 FIRST SUCCESS

 A comparatively peaceful election, conducted in the midst of uncertainty, violence and strife, is a rare achievement. For the Palestinians, it is a turning of sorts, given that the last presidential election was in 1996. How far this turning shall take them would depend only partly on Mr Mahmoud Abbas, the man they have elected to succeed Yasser Arafat. Mr Abbas?s credentials as a moderate and as a resilient believer in the possibility of a peaceful solution to the Palestine-Israel conflict make his leadership of the Palestinian Authority a desirable one for the West. Experienced in dialogue and negotiation and widely regarded as the architect of the Oslo peace process, he is a man whom even Mr Ariel Sharon is willing to meet soon, although the Israeli prime minister had long refused to see Arafat after accusing him of fomenting violence. Ironically, the Hamas has also expressed its willingness to ?work with? Mr Abbas. The potential fragility of Mr Abbas?s political balance is perhaps best exemplified in the fact that this same militant group had called for a boycott of the Sunday elections. And just to make sure that he did not believe his request to end violence was being taken to heart, Palestinian militant groups fired rockets into Israel from the Gaza Strip on election day.

 A democratic election, carried out before the eyes of observers from other countries, does say something about the people?s desires. It is good for Mr Abbas that his victory is by such a huge margin, for according to analysts, that alone would establish a popular mandate for peace. It would also help him rebuild the fragmenting Palestinian Authority on firmer lines. Without it, the essentials of governance and development would still elude the Palestinian people. There can be no doubt that the Palestinians are tired of death, violence and disorder. The huge absence of Arafat needs to be filled too. And Arafat was repeatedly on Mr Abbas?s lips during his campaign, his tensions with the dead leader now past history. But the Hamas?s friendliness does not mean willingness to give up the ?choice of resistance?. Inevitably, Israel will insist on an end to violence from Palestinian militants before the next stage on the roadmap is reached. While stopping violence ? from both sides ? is a priority, the hard issues have ultimately to be confronted. It is neither the people alone, nor Mr Abbas alone, who will decide the price that must be paid for peace.

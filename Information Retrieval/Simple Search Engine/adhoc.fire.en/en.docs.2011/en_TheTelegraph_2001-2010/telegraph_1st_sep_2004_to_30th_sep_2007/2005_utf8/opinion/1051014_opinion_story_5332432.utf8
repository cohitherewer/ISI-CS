 HOW A CHANNEL WAS SOLD

 Doordarshan Days By Bhaskar Ghose, Penguin, Rs 395

 Some years ago, Jaspal Bhatti had predicted that soon hawkers would be selling TV channels with an ?aye channel we?, just the way they sell vegetables. What seemed a joke then, is fast becoming a reality. Today it is difficult to imagine that we once had only one modest channel ? Doordarshan. We complained at the slightest goof up, but come Wednesday evening, we would all plant ourselves before the TV set to watch Chitrahaar, or eagerly wait for Hum Log, Buniyad, Nukkad or the Ramayana and Mahabharata. Bhaskar Ghose relives that era while he recounts his days in the Doordarshan as its director-general. 

 Early June in 1986, when he was the commissioner of north Bengal, Ghose was handpicked by the prime minister, Rajiv Gandhi, to take charge of the Doordarshan. The prime minister wanted some sweeping changes to come over Doordarshan so that it could reach international standards. Why Ghose was chosen is a question he has not been able to answer till date, but surely his account proves that it was one twist of fate he really treasures. 

 When he joined, Doordarshan was in a sorry mess. With great passion and enthusiasm Ghose embarked on his task. It was during his tenure that the immensely popular serials like Ramayana and Mahabharata were aired. This was also the first time when a cricket world cup and an election were covered live. It was under Ghose?s supervision that Doordarshan reported live from a danger zone during Operation Black Thunder in Amritsar.

 Ghose?s account is filled with lively anecdotes ? the fly that disturbed the prime minister during a studio recording, Ramanand Sagar?s bulldozing of Ghose into sanctioning slots for his never- ending serial, the way Ghose lost his chance of becoming the first DG to have read news and so on. It also speaks of the time when TV personalities like Pranoy Roy and Nalini Singh were making a beginning. This book is a wonderful read, spiced as it is with humour and self-criticism. The most moving part is Ghose?s recounting of the Sunday evening when he was given charge of Doordarshan: ?I suddenly found tears coursing down my face and I broke down completely.? But this is the only sentimental moment in the entire book.

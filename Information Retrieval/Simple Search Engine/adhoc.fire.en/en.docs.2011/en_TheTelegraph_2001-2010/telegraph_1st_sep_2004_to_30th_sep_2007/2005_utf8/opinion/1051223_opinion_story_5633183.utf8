 BAD LADS

 The exposure of corrupt members of parliament demonstrates the power of visuals. Reports and studies of the kinds of corruption encouraged by the member of parliament local area development scheme could not match the impact of scenes depicting seven MPs demanding or accepting bribes to sanction projects. The written reports already confirmed what was known for a long time in the highest circles of government ? that the taxpayers? money given to MPs every year to be used in development activities in their constituencies travels in very different directions from the expected one. Corruption is now an accepted ? and acceptable ? part of politics: wealth, not austere dutifulness, is the usual accompaniment to elected representation. The electorate need not know how that happens; those who do know are the ones who benefit: family, cronies, party members and supporters. They, therefore, are complicit. The trick of carrying on with corruption is to create vested interests in it for as many people as possible while retaining power. That is the only way to infect the whole system, so that abuse of power seems routine and exposure both unlikely and inconsequential.

 On the practical level, the greatest problem of the MPLAD scheme is the lack of accountability. The MPs need not answer questions about how the money has been spent or where it went, they merely need to wait for next year for more to come along. This adds up to a continuous leakage of crores of public money. At another level, questions have arisen about the democratic credentials of all schemes that allow elected representatives to disburse taxpayers? money as they wish. Even if it is true that the elected representative knows best the problems in his constituency, there is always a question of bias towards members or supporters of his own party. Their problems will tend to come first. Besides, when MPs do use the money well, in the overall ambience of indifference and inaction, it will inevitably help him or his party be re-elected the next term. That is not only undemocratic from the point of view of his rivals, but it further damages democracy by lowering the chances of a healthy rotation of rule among different parties. While honesty cannot be enforced, the scope for dishonesty could be lessened. Scrapping the MPLAD scheme would be a beginning.

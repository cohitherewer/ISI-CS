 Letters to Editor

 Without a cause c?l?bre

 Sir ? Post-Kushboo, the moral police seem to be out in all states, but not without reason perhaps. It may be stylish to hail pre-marital sex, but most often, women have to bear the brunt of this attitude. It cannot be denied that rampant promiscuity has brought its own set of problems for modern women ? teenage pregnancy, emotional trauma, blackmail, low self-esteem and even prostitution. Women should be allowed to decide on their own attitudes instead of being ?led? by feminists or men pretending to uphold their ?cause?.

 Yours faithfully,

Anuradha Goswami, Calcutta

 Selling sports

 Sir ? Sumanta Sen takes a myopic view of things in ?Ready, steady, go? (Oct 6). Why would corporates put their money in football clubs who never win anything at the international level? If the money was used simply to send teams abroad to play ? and lose ? matches, that would be useless. We need to channel resources towards integrating sports with the primary and secondary school curriculum. Once we reduce the burden of books and encourage our children to go out and play more, half of our job is done. Money should be spent on gyms, playing grounds, equipment and professional training at schools from a very young age. I don?t see young children being escorted by their parents to coaching centres in Britain. They have all they want in their schools. 

 Cricket has developed infrastructure at the grass roots in the form of the burgeoning coaching centres for kids. But we have failed to enmesh even this much-loved sport in the mainstream education system, where children can pursue it without fearing about their studies being hampered. It would also give them a much better physical training and focussed approach, which would help develop a more professional attitude towards sports.

 Yours faithfully,

Aruni Mukherjee, Coventry, UK

 Sir ? As Raju Mukherji points out in ?Money for nothing? (Oct 12), sports other than cricket have received a step-motherly treatment from the government, sponsors, as well as the public. Yes, after Sania Mirza?s tremendous performance, the state government has come forward with cash endowments. But the same government has refused to assist a world-class chess-player like Koneru Humpy. The same attitude is prevalent in West Bengal, which granted prime land to a cricketer while denying the same to an international grandmaster. Despite the superb performance of women hockey-players, women athletes and boxers, talented sportswomen do not get adequate assistance from sports organizations, the government or sponsors. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

 Sir ? All sports, including cricket, need both corporate money and corporate management. We should learn from Europe and the US, where sports is seen as an economic activity and sports clubs as profitable companies. American sports tycoon, Malcolm Glazer, has giant stakes in Manchester United, while a Russian billionaire owns Chelsea, another top football club. Players are routinely traded between clubs. In 2005, English premier clubs spent $ 523 million to buy players. If cricket-playing nations had clubs run like business companies, Sachin Tendulkar or Shane Warne would perhaps be similarly bought and sold. Unfortunately, Indian politicians control cricket in one form or another. Laloo Yadav, Farooq Abdullah, Sharad Pawar and Arun Jaitley, all head cricket associations in different states. They want to control cricket because it is glamorous and hanging around with sports stars gets them media coverage. What do they know of cricket?s economic potential? 

 Yours faithfully, 

Sayak Ray, Calcutta

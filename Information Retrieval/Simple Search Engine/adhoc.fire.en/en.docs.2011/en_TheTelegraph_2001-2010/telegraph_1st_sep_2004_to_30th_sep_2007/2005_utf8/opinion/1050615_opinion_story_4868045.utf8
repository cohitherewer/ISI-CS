 TO ENSURE SAFE PASSAGE

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the WHO?s revised international health regulations, adopted at the World Health Assembly, May 16, 2005

 If the competent authority for 

 the point of entry is not able to carry out the control 

 measures required under this Article, the affected conveyance 

 may nevertheless be allowed to depart, subject to the following 

 conditions: 

 (a) the competent authority shall, at the time of departure, inform the competent authority for the next known point of entry of the type of information referred to under subparagraph b; 

 (b) in the case of a ship, the evidence found and the control measures required shall be noted in the Ship Sanitation Control Certificate. Any such conveyance shall be permitted to take on, under the supervision of the competent authority, fuel, water, food and supplies. 

 3. A conveyance that has been considered as affected shall cease to be regarded as such when the competent authority is satisfied that: 

 (a) the measures provided in para 1 of this Article have been effectively carried out; and 

 (b) there are no conditions on board that could constitute a public health risk. 

 Article 28: Ships and aircraft at points of entry: 1. Subject to Article 43 or as provided in applicable international agreements, a ship or an aircraft shall not be prevented for public health reasons from calling at any point of entry. However, if the point of entry is not equipped for applying health measures under these regulations, the ship or aircraft may be ordered to proceed at its own risk to the nearest suitable point of entry available to it, unless the ship or aircraft has an operational problem which would make this diversion unsafe. 

 2. Subject to Article 43 or as provided in applicable international agreements, ships or aircraft shall not be refused free pratique by States Parties for public health reasons; in particular they shall not be prevented from embarking or disembarking, discharging or loading cargo or stores, or taking on fuel, water, food and supplies. State Parties may subject the granting of free pratique to inspection and, if a source of infection or contamination is found on board, the carrying out of necessary disinfection, decontamination, disinfection or derating, or other measures necessary to prevent the spread of the infection or contamination. 

 3. Whenever practicable and subject to the previous para, a State Party shall authorize the granting of free pratique by radio or other communication means to a ship or an aircraft when, on the basis of information received from it prior to its arrival, the State Party is of the opinion that the arrival of the ship or aircraft will not result in the introduction or spread of disease. 

 4. Officers in command of ships or pilots in command of aircraft, or their agents, shall make known to the port or airport control as early as possible before arrival at the port or airport of destination any cases of illness indicative of a disease of an infectious nature or evidence of a public health risk on board as soon as such illnesses or public health risks are made known to the officer or pilot. This information must be immediately relayed to the competent authority for the port or airport. 

 In urgent circumstances, such information should be communicated directly by the officers or pilots to the relevant port or airport authority.

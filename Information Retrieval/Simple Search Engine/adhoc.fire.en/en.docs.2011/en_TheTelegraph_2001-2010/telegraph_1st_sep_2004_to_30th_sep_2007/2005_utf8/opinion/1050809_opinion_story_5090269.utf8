 TO STOP A KILLER IN ITS TRACKS

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the communique issued by the G8 nations at Gleneagles, July 8

 Supporting the Polio Eradication Initiative for the post eradication period in 2006-8 through continuing or increasing our own contributions toward the $829 million target and mobilizing the support of others....

 (g) Working with African countries to scale up action against malaria to reach 85 per cent of the vulnerable populations with the key interventions that will save 600,000 children?s lives a year by 2015 and reduce the drag on African economies from this preventable and treatable disease. By contributing to the additional $1.5 billion a year needed annually to help ensure access to anti- malaria insecticide-treated mosquito nets, adequate and sustainable supplies of combination therapies... presumptive treatment for pregnant woman and babies, household residual spraying and the capacity in African health services to effectively use them, we can reduce the burden of malaria as a major killer of children in sub-Saharan Africa.

 (h) Helping to meet the needs identified by the Stop TB Partnership. We also support the call for a high-level conference of Health Ministers for TB in 2006.

 (i) Implementing the G8 water action plan agreed at Evian, in partnership with the AfDB initiative on rural water and sanitation, including through increasing aid in this sector; maintaining political momentum and commitment on the water issue, and monitoring mechanisms.

 (j) Reconfirming our Sea Island commitment to help countries that are willing to make a political commitment to develop comprehensive food security and famine prevention programmes.

 19. Private enterprise is a prime engine of growth and development. Enhancing governance and the rule of law will attract more and broader private investment, including FDI, which is the basic condition for inclusive growth. African countries need to build a much stronger investment climate: we will continue to help them do so, including through the promotion of a stable, efficient and harmonized legal business framework (noting the work of the OHADA business legal unification process and the improvement of the investment climate through the OECD/NBPAD Investment Initiative) and increased access to finance, including strong support for the development of micro-finance in Africa. Partnership between the public and private sectors is crucial.

 20. Investment is needed in sustainable agriculture, which is the most important economic sector for most Africans. African governments have made a commitment to invest 10 per cent of their budgets in agriculture. We will strengthen our support for their commitment.

 21. An ambitious and balanced conclusion to the Doha Round is the best way to make trade work for Africa and increase African countries? integration into the global economy. The Hong Kong Ministerial in December will be a critical step towards a successful outcome of the DDA in 2006. Our separate statement on the DDA gives more details of the potential benefits. The World Bank estimates that completing these negotiations could lift 140 million people out of poverty.

 22. We agree:

 a. To increase our help to developing countries to build the physical, human and institutional capacity to trade, in including trade facilitation measures. We are committed to granting additional support for trade capacity-building to assist LDCs, particularly in Africa, to take advantage of the new opportunities to trade, which will result from a positive conclusion of the DDA. We call on the IFIs to submit proposals to the annual meetings for additional assistance to countries to develop their capacity to trade and ease adjustment in their economies;

 b. To provide resources and training to help African producers meet current and new health and safety standard setting and regulatory bodies to work with African exporters and national authorities, and we will support African nations in playing their full part in the relevant international standard setting bodies, in order to facilitate African export to our markets.

 MAD GIRL IN A LITTLE DRESS

 It is not news when a woman is locked up by her family. In spite of the advances made by the women?s movement in India, the status of women in the country is still fragile, uncertain. Social systems and attitudes are geared not to acknowledge their rights as human beings; among large sections of the population, equality for women is not an issue. Usually, stories of women?s confinement originate in marital homes, and usually again, these tales are of dowry extortion and torture. But in Dhenkanal in Orissa, it was a prosperous businessman who locked up his daughter in a tiny chamber 20 years ago, because she was reportedly behaving erratically. That is, he, and the rest of the family, supposed her to be insane. Cruelty of this kind is not only routine and unthinking, it is also part of a general attitude. After the woman?s rescue, the police expressed approval of the father.

 The substance of the police?s defence is illuminating. It is garbed in paternalistic or protective terms. Locking up the apparently unstable girl was the best thing the father could have done, because otherwise she could have run away and got raped. The apparent concern for the girl?s welfare disguises two central issues. One is that of family ?honour?. She is a threat in two ways. Being raped has more to do with family honour than with violence perpetrated on a woman, or with criminality. Similarly, a ?mad? daughter is an embarrassment, a social impediment, perhaps even an obstacle to the ?good? marriages of her siblings. Taking her to a psychiatrist might cure her, but it would also mean making her shameful condition public. The second issue that the police?s defence exposes ? almost in spite of itself ? is the core of patriarchal ownership. The police feel that no case of illegal detention can be instituted against the father. The reason is starkly simple. The 20-year-long ordeal of the woman is not illegal because the gaoler is her father. The father has absolute right over the life and health of the daughter. It is not difficult to see how this translates into the sense of absolute right, even of violence and cruelty, that a husband feels over his wife. This, fortunately, is now being held up to scrutiny.

 The social and public expression of the male desire for control and possession may vary. At a completely different level, the same mindset, this time given the garb of religious faith, pronounces vocal disapproval of the way Sania Mirza dresses. There is a blinding myopia in the attitude. The woman who is aspiring to go where no woman in her country has gone before, who is showing in abundance the killer instinct that Indian sportspeople have often been said to lack, is perceived also to have violated the tenets of her faith by wearing short skirts and sleeveless tops. The same darkness of vision informs both forms of control: it is less absurd than sinister.

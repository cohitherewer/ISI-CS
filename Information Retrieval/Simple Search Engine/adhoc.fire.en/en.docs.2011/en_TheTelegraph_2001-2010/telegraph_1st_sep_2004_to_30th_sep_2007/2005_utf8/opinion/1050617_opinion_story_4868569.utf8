 Letters to Editor

 While the campus burns

 Sir ? I was a student of electrical engineering at Jadavpur University from 1955-59 and an executive member of the students? union between 1957 and 1959. We had differences with our teachers but never dreamt of ?gheraoing? or assaulting them. Under the leadership of Triguna Sen, the faculty and students imbibed a culture of discipline and mutual respect. The global alumni association of JU still tries to uphold this culture. The present impasse has been caused by students taking the law into their hands ? a culture that is the legacy of communist rule in the state. The chief minister?s refusal to meet the five fasting students and the comments by Messrs Biman Bose and Anil Biswas all go to show that the communists have now fallen victims to the Frankenstein?s monster that they created over the decades. My humble suggestion as an alumnus to the agitating students is that they apologize for their act of 2003. In return, the authorities should withdraw their suspension orders and settle their demands peacefully. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sunil Kumar Pal, London

 Sir ? The brutal assault by the state administration on the fasting students of Jadavpur University indicates the complete politicization of the affairs of the university (?Basu blasts JU action?, June 13). What is most intriguing is that the minister for higher education did not feel it necessary to step in to sort out the problem.

 The agitation of the students ? demanding the revocation of suspension order on five students ? was peaceful till the police were let loose on them. Instead of trying to get the agitating students across the table, the university administration chose to silence them with the baton. But this has only queered the pitch further for the authorities, since the students now have more sympathizers behind them than ever before. 

 The sound bites emanating from Alimuddin Street after the midnight attack do not leave anyone in any doubt about the stake that the political masters of the state have in the affair. It is now left to the chief minister to shrug off his guarded stance and show some personal initiative to resolve the issue.

 Yours faithfully,

Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

 Sir ? The action taken by the police at Jadavpur University on June 11 has been totally misrepresented and misunderstood. The Left Front government, on receiving information that a few young men were starving to death, sent the police to ensure that the starving youth were properly fed and treated and that not a single starvation-death occurred in West Bengal. Men in uniform were sent instead of people from the food or relief departments because the force is considered to be the most friendly and because greater people-police interaction needs to be developed. The Rapid Action Force was employed only to speed up the process. The young men were not taken to any police station but to the hospital so that they might get proper medical care, if necessary.

 The result of the food and the treatment was there for everyone to see. The young men who were lying half-conscious on the ground when the police arrived, were on their feet the very next day making statements before the television cameras. Some anti-social elements tried to prevent the police from rescuing and helping the starving young men, with the objective of discrediting the government. The officers present tried to reason with them and requested the mob not to disrupt the rescue operation. But when the mob went berserk, the force had to resort to that little bit of lathi-charge that was required to help the starving poor.

 I hope the people will now see the midnight operation in its proper perspective.

 Yours faithfully,

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? Surely the vice-chancellor and registrar of JU knew what the police are capable of? And surely they did not call the police to remove a few boys who had gone without food for five days? Teachers marching against police excesses is a clear indication of where the popular support lies. Students? affairs are controlled so comprehensively by the mainstream political parties these days that it is not surprising to find the unions carrying out administrative jobs such as the distribution of admission forms. Under these circumstances, a gradual degeneration of student culture is only to be expected.

 Yours faithfully,

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? Thanks to its obstinate top bosses, Jadavpur University, otherwise respected for its smooth functioning and a steady outflow of brilliant professionals, has only a tarnished reputation to show for its golden jubilee celebrations. It is a matter of pathetic irony that such police atrocities took place in the assembly constituency of the chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who is also the police minister. In both his ministerial and representative capacities, Bhattacharjee?s first reaction was silence, probably because he was left without an explanation.

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Sir ? The television brought into our drawing rooms pictures of young students, including girls, being beaten up and manhandled by policemen on a university campus some days ago. And to think that this was happening in one of the top-ranking and most prestigious institutions of the country! The incident needs to be properly investigated and taken up with the highest authorities in the state and the country. An explanation should be sought from the JU authorities who called in the police to break the fast-unto-death agitation. The have-stick-will-beat attitude of our police personnel also needs to be investigated, and if needed exemplary punishment should be meted out to those involved. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Prasenjit Sen, Calcutta

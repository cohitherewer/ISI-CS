 TRANSIT TALES

 - Stories from nowhere

TOKYO CANCELLED 

By Rana Dasgupta, 

HarperCollins, Rs 395

Stories within stories, it?s a narrative gambit as 

old as the Arabian Nights, the Betal Panchavimsati or The Canterbury 

Tales. Of these (and without making heavy weather of it), Tokyo Cancelled 

could claim to be closest to the last. Both share a ?frame? narrative of people 

telling stories to while away time. If Chaucer?s pilgrims wanted to lighten the 

tedium of a journey, the 13 story-tellers here have been held up in an airport 

because their flight to Tokyo has been cancelled by a snowstorm. 

 The doffing of the cap to Chaucer does not end there. If ?pilgrimage? was a metaphor by which Chaucer emphasized that the journey was more important than its destination, for Dasgupta the airport becomes something of a metaphor. It is at once the ?Middle of Nowhere?, as it is the ?black corridor between two worlds, two somewheres where people only alighted when something was seriously kaput with the normal eschatological machinery?. In other words, the airport is like a symbolic rent in the elaborate constructions of modern-day reality. It is the ?non-space? that seems to bring down the barriers that our modern nation-states put in the way of peoples? mobility, as do new technologies like the internet and the mobile phone in their own way. It is this rent that frees the imagination and through which the author can discern stories ? the stories that the 13 stranded passengers tell. 

 The stories they tell are curiously ?unrooted?. They might be set in Delhi, or Paris, or London, but the events they describe could have taken place anywhere. Marlboro could well have been Mahesh from Calcutta or Mumbai, and ?The Flyover? could have been set in any city in a third-world country where an expanding population and pressures on real estate have given rise to a criminal underclass. It?s as if identity based on geography has no meaning in a world where despair and poverty travel faster than do people in their supersonic jets. As if to emphasize this, none of the story-tellers is named, nor is anything said about what they do or where they come from. All that sets apart Dasgupta?s narrators is their appearance which, perhaps, is meant to point to their inner world ? ?She was broad and tall?, or ?A large middle-aged man with remarkable crevasses on his face?. Obviously, we?ve moved far away from Chaucer who took considerable pains to establish the social identity of each of his pilgrims. 

 The stories themselves are best described as modern fairytales. They begin, just as all good fairytales do ? ?Not so long ago?In the city of London or Paris or Delhi?? ? drawing in the readers? attention, plunging him into the thick of things. Like fairytales again, they are part real, part plausible and part fantasy. This is, of course, Magic Realism, and readers will find echoes here of Garc?a M?rquez, Rushdie, Kafka, Joyce, even Coleridge. Is not the wingless little bird, who walks from Marseille, all across the length of Europe to Katya?s apartment in Odessa and brings her news of Riad?s detention in a ship in the French port, the albatross from ?The Rime of the Ancient Mariner?? 

 The whimsy can be entertaining too. In ?The Store on Madison Avenue?, Robert De Niro?s illegitimate son (by a young Chinese woman whom the actor meets only once in a laundromat, and who grows up to become a Taxi Driver in New York) has an affair with the daughter of Isabella Rossellini and Martin Scorcese, conceived before their separation and whom the world knows nothing of. But this is not a sad story about lost inheritances. Nor is it just a love story between the two, Pavel and Isabella. Instead it is about what happens to the couple when they win the ?most magical prize ever? in a box of cookies, about how Isabella is transformed (as beautiful women are in all fairytales) into a fashion store on Madison Avenue, and about how the bad Chinese try to steal the formula, leaving her trapped mid-transformation, half-concrete, half-flesh. 

 Sometimes, the real and the fantastic are so enmeshed that it is difficult to tell them apart. Most of ?The Recycler of Dreams? is a long dream, or a series of dreams within one dream, which run into one another so closely that it is difficult to say where one ends and the other begins.

 While the stories are extraordinary enough, does Tokyo Cancelled work as a novel? Wouldn?t it have been better off as a collection of stories? As it is, the narrative frame is barely there ? seven pages of a chapter called ?Arrivals? to begin with, and another equally short, ?Departures?, at the end; and half pages to string the stories together ? sometimes not even that. Yes, the frame narrative does touch upon all the keys that are struck with greater force in the stories themselves. But this is still rather tenuous. Also, the intrusion of the fantastic into the real (as opposed to the real fleshing out the imaginary in the stories) ? in the shape of the animal discovered dead in a corner in the morning (?land cousin of the lobster, the crayfish, a long armoured body, segmented, bristling with hairs and antennae?) ? is a bit heavyhanded. But that?s nitpicking with a novel that is otherwise extraordinary for its readability and for its explorations of the myths that underlie contemporary life.

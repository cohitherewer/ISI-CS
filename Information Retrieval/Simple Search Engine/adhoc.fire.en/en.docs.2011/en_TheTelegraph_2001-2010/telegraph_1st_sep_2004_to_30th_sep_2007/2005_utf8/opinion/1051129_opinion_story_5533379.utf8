 WHOSE TEA PARTY?

 Tea in Assam is both business and politics. Political storms over teacups are, therefore, not unexpected in the state, especially on the eve of elections. But the latest stirrings in Assam?s tea gardens have worrying signals for the industry. Two different threats loom large over the tea gardens. Recent abductions of tea executives and the huge ransom demands are proof of the government?s inability to provide security to the industry. The economic cost of this failure can be disastrous for Assam, since tea is the state?s only organized industry and its largest provider of industrial jobs. The other threat comes from the belligerent movement of the Assam Tea Tribes Students? Association. The group?s demands, which include an amendment to the Plantation Labour Act and improvements in the social infrastructure of the industry, are aimed more at the government than at the garden owners. Past experiences, however, suggest that the government would try to make the industry pay for the additional costs. Should this happen, it could cripple the industry and lead to closures of some of the gardens. The tea industry has long been forced to bear the burden of education, healthcare and other social amenities that should have been the government?s responsibility. No industry can afford to pay too long for the government?s lack of funds or direction. 

 Unfortunately, the government of Mr Tarun Gogoi continues to treat the tea industry as a platform for the Congress?s political battles. His reasons are quite obvious. Tea workers, especially the tribal people among them, have been the most loyal of the party?s vote-banks in Assam. But the ATTSA?s agitation has hit the party where it hurts most. Its threat to not allow Congress leaders, including ministers and legislators, to enter the tea gardens has rung alarm bells in the ruling party. And, the Bharatiya Janata Party?s move to fish in the tea gardens? troubled waters has complicated matters for Mr Gogoi even further. It is possible that the ATTSA is using its agitation for an electoral bargain. It is no secret that the group wants a larger share of the Congress?s tickets for its members during next year?s assembly elections. The danger is that the politicians may think nothing of ruining the industry for their petty politics. Worse still, irresponsible politicians can end up playing into the hands of Assam?s ethnic insurgents.

 NO CHILD?S WORLD

 Cruelty to children is not shocking in India; it is quite routine. If poverty is the reason behind the vast army of child labourers, cruelty cannot be put down to poverty or wealth. Cruelty to children is part of the culture of an ancient land where newborn girls are silently done to death in any number of traditional methods with regional variations. The halting spread of education has not yet been able to dislodge impenetrable layers of ignorance and superstition, creating a rich ground for the breeding of cruelty. In a village not far from Hyderabad, a tobacco farmer and his wife tied their 10-month-old adopted son to a stone and drowned him in the village well. They had adopted the child from a local orphanage, not because they lacked children but because the wife had given birth to a third daughter. The sickly adopted baby provoked comments from the villagers about possible HIV infection, and the foster parents decided to put an end to the problem.

 It is difficult to even begin itemizing what is wrong. What leaps to the eye immediately are the casual procedures of adoption: the adoptive family should have the health records of the child from the orphanage, just as the orphanage should make sure that the aspiring foster parents are responsible and committed. Both sides seem equally indifferent; love, responsibility and the child?s happiness are not on anyone?s agenda. As fitting complement, there is the resistance to adoption in the village, compounded this time by shapeless fears about HIV. Murder was easier than a blood test. The superstitious ignorance about AIDS and HIV is now an added burden in Indian children?s lives. The baby in the well attests to the findings of the United Nations Development Programme?s 2005 report on human development that India is unable to look after its children. In West Midnapore in West Bengal, a six-year-old girl is unable to go to school or play, because her father and brother have died of AIDS and her mother is ill. She is shunned by all except her grandmother. No amount of proof that the child herself is HIV-negative will change the attitude of the villagers, not even the district health authorities? efforts to convince them. This child?s life has been darkened because of ignorance about AIDS, but she represents numberless Indian children deprived of happiness, health and of rights for uncounted reasons ? or for no reason at all.

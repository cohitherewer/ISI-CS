 LITTLE PROGRESS IN CLASS

 Asokendu Sengupta

 It was only in the Nineties, after India had been forced to open up its economy, that policy-makers realized the importance of education and healthcare. Not that the country had made no progress in these areas. Our literacy rate was a low 18 per cent in 1950-51 and in the next 50 years, it had reached 65 per cent. But compared to the performance of other under-developed countries that won independence in the Forties and Fifties, we will be forced to admit that our progress has been dismal indeed. 

 Our political institutions have stubbornly refused to recognize the failure of the delivery system. Instead, they blame the lack of sufficient resources for the partial success of the educational campaign. 

 Two landmark judgments of the Supreme Court in 1992 and 1993 forced our policy-makers to make the right to education a fundamental right through an amendment of the Constitution. This was meant to prove the state?s earnestness in following the directive principles contained in Article 45. But constitutional amendments do not ensure empowerment. Good and effective education remains as before an unattainable target, specially, with regard to girls and the children of scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and other backward classes.

 Funds aplenty

 The prime minister, Manmohan Singh, and the common minimum programme of the United Progressive Alliance have emphasized their commitment to implementing universal school education and pledged that the government would spend at least 6 per cent of the GDP for education. To mobilize funds, an education cess of 2 per cent has been imposed. 

 For the first 25 years after independence, not more than 2 per cent of GDP was allocated for education. Nobody thought this sector needed more funds. Only recently have we realized that investing in education and healthcare results in a higher growth rate and has an impact on poverty reduction. But, do outlays guarantee results? It is well-known that in India, not more than 15 per cent of the allotted money reaches the beneficiaries. 

 The Tapas Majumdar committee in the late Nineties had asked the state to allocate an added Rs 137,000 crore over 10 years. At the same time, it underlined the need for strict vigilance over expenditure, to achieve the goal in time. 

 Over the last decade, the government?s budgetary allocation for education has been hovering around 3.5-4 per cent of the GDP. But that has not been able to bring any perceptible change in the attitude of implementing agencies, and consequently, the growth rate has remained as slow as ever. 

 All in the mind

 In general, people want their children to have a good education. Sadly, not only is the curriculum uninteresting, but it is also not geared towards ensuring employment. The result: a high drop-out rate. Retention is no less challenging than enrolment and to reduce the drop-out rate we do not necessarily need much funds. It is political will that can electrify the implementing agencies. 

 There are numerous schemes ? Operation Blackboard, Sarva Siksha Avijan, mid-day meal and so on ? to eradicate illiteracy. Each scheme has a specific purpose. But, the multiplicity of schemes may not help, rather they may lead to wasteful expenditure and may mislead those for whom they are meant. However, it will be unwise to scrap schemes at random. Instead, schemes must be prioritized; they must be chosen keeping in mind the needs of a region, and integrated. Also, care must be taken to make the syllabus effective and attractive. This cannot be done from above. It must be done after taking the people into confidence. People?s participation is the single most important factor for any education-related scheme to come good.

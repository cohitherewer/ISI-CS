 DRAWING BLOOD IN THE NAME OF A PEOPLE

 VOTES AND VIOLENCE: Electoral Competition and Communal Riots in India By Steven I. Wilkinson, Cambridge, Rs 375

 C ommunal violence in India has become a popular subject for study for several reasons. One, since the communal divide continues to haunt the polity, and two, because politicians seem to have developed a habit of using religious identity in their electoral agenda. Of course, there are other issues related to communal violence, and Wilkinson?s elegant study brings out the relative importance of these issues.

 His main purpose is to focus on state-level rather than town-level variations in the occurrence of riots. This emphasis is not groundless. ?States matter because it is India?s state governments, rather than the country?s national, municipal or district governments, that control the local police or paramilitary forces and decide how much force is to be used to prevent or stop riots at the local level.? 

 Wilkinson rejects the town-level economic explanation for riots ? an ethnically divided labour market and the effort of Muslim craftsmen to get rich by starting their own businesses. Had it been so, one would expect to see Muslims starting riots where they are economically dominant, which is not the case. But the author does not take into account the fact that Muslim businessmen, even if economically dominant, are afraid of a possible Hindu backlash that could harm their near and dear ones living elsewhere. 

 Wilkinson has tried to develop a theory that can be subjected to rigorous scrutiny. Some of his findings are ? riots being determined by variables like proximity to an election, the closeness of the race in the previous state election, the nearness to a 50-50 parity in the Hindu-Muslim ratio, the size of the population of the town or city, and the number of contesting political parties. He also examines the counter-arguments to his findings ? that it is difficult to believe communal violence in the name of the majority identity can swing votes in favour of the party identifying itself with the majority cause. While the author does not dispute it, he argues that victory in an election necessitates an effective appeal to pivotal swing-voters. And this is where the motive behind pre-poll violence resides.

 Wilkinson says that institutional weakness of the state ? to take independent action to prevent and put down riots ? is widespread in India but is unable to explain the state-level variation in the spread of communal violence. He says, ?The problem is not so much state capacity... as the instructions given by politicians to state officials to protect or not to protect minorities.? He could have also mentioned that the organs of one state might be more communalized than another.

 Most interesting is Wilkinson?s treatment of the ?consociational? explanation of violence. It means a state ?with a ?grand coalition? that includes representation of all the main ethnic groups, a minority veto over important legislation, and minority proportionality in government and employment.? The author argues that the pre-1947 Indian state was relatively consociational, but this character declined in the Nehru era, although there was a reassertion of it in the post-Nehru period during which communal violence increased. In contrast to Arend Lijphart?s theory, Wilkinson effectively demolishes the idea that Congress-rule represented an antidote to communal violence. 

 Wilkinson finds some states with a bad record of accommodating Muslims in ministries and government records, though he is aware that minority representation does not mean only office-holding by Muslims. It means incorporation of the ?concerns and interests? of the minorities in the calculations of political leaders. Wilkinson sees a negative relationship between minority participation and incidence of riots. But he asks whether both these variables might not be the outcome of electoral competition.

 Party variables are significant in containing riots, as in the communist-ruled states. Wilkinson asks if Muslim votes would not be considered ?costly? if Muslims aspire for more wealth and become politically more mobilized. But in West Bengal, where the incidence of communal violence are few, Muslims remain weakly mobilized and they aspire for little. Having established that increasing party competition is negatively correlated to communal violence, the author describes party fractionalization in some states. 

 Notwithstanding the quality of the work, questions remain. Is electoral victory and end or a means to an end? If it is a means, one has to undertake a study of the possible ends that a violence-instigating party might have in mind. It is also necessary to examine the real class basis of a party that identifies itself with the majority cause.

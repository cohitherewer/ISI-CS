 ON TOP OF THE WORLD

One More Step: 

An Autobiography 

By M.S. Kohli, Penguin, Rs 495

Ever since he led the first successful Indian expedition 

to Everest in 1965, M.S. Kohli has been the leading light of Indian mountaineering. 

He had failures before the historic success, but his passion for the Himalaya 

was never to be measured by that one great stride over the Hillary Step. Even 

when he was not on any climbing mission, he was not far from the mountains. He 

was either training other climbers or promoting the peaks to people from other 

shores. 

 This is the story of the man?s life on and off the mountains. The climbing episodes are fairly known by now, particularly the Everest expedition and the other major mission to Nanda Devi, in which a joint Indo-US team was to plant a nuclear device on the peak in order to monitor Chinese missile launches. 

 Kohli wrote about the Everest expedition in Nine Atop Everest. This time, however, he recounts two earlier attempts on the peak, in one of which he had to spend three frightful nights in the ?death zone? above 27,650 feet. The secrecy that shrouded the intelligence mission to Nanda Devi was lifted by him in his recent book, Spies in the Himalayas. This autobiography too presents a candid account of that ill-fated and controversial mission.

 But the present book has much more than accounts of Kohli?s mountaineering missions. The section on his early life in his native village of Haripur in the North-West Frontier Province of present-day Pakistan is full of high drama. It includes a hair-raising description of the family?s escape to Amritsar from the post-Partition riots that killed the majority of Sikhs living in Haripur.

 The violence left a lifelong scar on his mind. But Kohli is convinced that this traumatic experience and the rigours of life as a refugee in Punjab and Delhi prepared him for the thin air, the icy, howling winds and the ever-present threat of death that he faced on the mountains in later life. And the triumphs on the mountains led to new rewards in his professional life with the Indian Navy, the Indo-Tibetan Border Police or Air India. Above everything else, though, there was the Indian Mountaineering Federation, of which he was the guiding spirit for fourteen years.

 The book, ultimately, presents the image of a man whose zest for life is matched by an undying faith in himself and in his god.

 Letters to Editor

 In the name of the poor

 Sir ? S. Venkitaramanan?s ? Only for the poor? (Jan 10) is a well thought-out article on subsidies. But however noble the idea of subsidy, the fact remains that it is not a tool for improving the living standards of the people. Subsidy is often given by diverting funds from development projects. Moreover, subsidies don?t always reach those who really need it. The government ought to keep in mind that subsidies are like giving alms to the poor to keep them alive so that they can beg tomorrow. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sex, lies and CDs

 Sir ? The ?Clean chit for Anara? (Jan 6) given by the Andhra Pradesh State Forensic Laboratory, which concluded that the woman in the pornographic CDs was not the same person, was long due. Especially, if one remembers how the media have flashed the news continuously for the last two months. With almost all the news channels working 24-hours-a-day throughout the year without a break, it appears that they are running short of credible stories. This is what is driving the channels to focus on the lives of inconsequential people and on news relating to sex and pornography, some of which are fictitious. 

 In the Anara Gupta case, what is objectionable is that the media latched on to the version of the story given by the Jammu police, without bothering to lend a ear to Anara?s pleas of innocence. Can the media now make up for the humiliation the Gupta family has suffered?

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? It is appalling to see how the Jammu police has tarnished the image of Anara Gupta. The whole incident gives enough reason for the actions of the police to be brought under scrutiny. Are they performing their duties? It is disgraceful enough that a young woman should have been ensnared in the flesh trade. The insensitivity of the law-enforcing authorities only makes it worse. 

 Anara?s efforts to put back together the broken pieces of her life are laudable. Here we have a lady who has determination and fortitude. But can she and her family now have a safe and honourable existence?

 Yours faithfully,

Sharmi Adhikary, Calcutta

 Sir ? Anara Gupta?s exoneration from the pornographic racket has once again exposed the dark side of the police administration. The police seem to be helpless when it comes to catching the real criminals, and vent their anger on ordinary people instead. The highhandedness of the law enforcement agencies is legendary. But such an attitude on the part of the uniformed men who are supposed to protect us, not only leads to mental and physical harassment, but also dilutes public faith in the keepers of law. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Siddhartha Raj Guha, Jabalpur 

 Sir ? The Anara Gupta case is on its way to a closure now. But what is strange is the silence of the National Human Rights Commission and the National Commission for Women, which had received formal complaints from Anara herself, all this while.

Yours faithfully,

A. Mandal, Calcutta 

 Parting shot

 Sir ? It was awful to see the Calcutta mayor, Subrata Mukherjee, hitting the streets to collect money for the tsunami victims from poor people like the rickshaw-wallahs. Was this necessary, especially since there seems to be no dearth of funds? More important, is this becoming of a man who spends crores of rupees on Durga puja every year? 

 Yours faithfully,

Soham Gupta, Calcutta

 The mind knows no borders

 MEMOIRS (Rupa, Rs 295) by Pablo Neruda is the 1977 classic which has been reprinted by Rupa exclusively for readers in the Indian subcontinent. The 1971 Nobel laureate?s memoirs begin in the Chilean forests (?Anyone who hasn?t been in the Chilean forest doesn?t know this planet?) and ends with a painful episode of Chilean history, culminating in the assassination of the president, Salvador Allende. The poet, who was variously a refugee, ambassador and politician, was truly a citizen of the world, moving from France to India to the Soviet Union with equal ease. Neruda?s friendships ? with Lorca, Malraux, Nancy Cunard ? blossomed, paying little attention to national and international borders. Neruda the political individual is a bigger presence in these memoirs than Neruda the poet, but his life does reflect the intensity of his poetry.

 Kashmir 1947: A Survivor?s Story (Penguin, Rs 200) by Krishna Mehta is a tale of ?courage and dignity in the darkest of times? ? in that lost paradise, Kashmir. In July 1947, Mehta?s husband is sent to Muzaffarabad as the wazir-e-wazarat (district commissioner). For his wife and children, it is the beginning of severely trying times. Only months after the independence of India and Pakistan, Kashmir was under attack. How the author and her young children and niece survive the attack is an amazing tale of grit, desperation and the warmth of the ordinary people of the valley.

 Akbar and the Rise of the Mughal Empire (Rupa, Rs 195) by G.B. Malleson was first published in 1891. It is very much in the genre of histories written by British civil servants, which painted the period before the arrival of the British as a lavish yet melodramatic and brutal theatre of war. The British, of course, added the civilizing touch. Malleson, however, has a word of praise for the Mughal ruler: ?He wrote poetry well, and was remarkable for the ease of his address and his intelligence.?

Margarettown (Hodder and Stoughton, ?6.90) by Gabrielle Zevin is a love story about Margaret Towne and the man who falls in love with her. ?What he doesn?t know is that loving Maggie means loving many women at once. Zevin?s novel is a journey through the many worlds of one woman which are taken over and changed by love.

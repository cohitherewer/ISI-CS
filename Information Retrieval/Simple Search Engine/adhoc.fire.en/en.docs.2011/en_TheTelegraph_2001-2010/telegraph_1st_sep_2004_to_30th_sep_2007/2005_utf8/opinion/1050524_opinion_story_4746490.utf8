 MANY PUZZLES IN THE TOP JOB

 In today?s political reality, proximity to the chief minister pays when it is time to select the chief secretary, writes A.K. Chatterjee

 In our democratic framework of government, the executive, legislature and judiciary have well-defined roles. The civil services, which represent the permanent executive, advise the political executive, that is the council of ministers, over the framing of policies. Civil servants are supposed to be anonymous, and once policies are framed, their duty is to carry them out. The political executive has to take the credit or blame in the media or the assembly, and, finally, in the elections. If the civil services are that anonymous, why does the choice of a civil servant for the topmost post raise such interest and sometimes bitter controversy? 

 All senior civil servants belonging to the Indian administrative services come through a highly competitive examination which ensures that only meritorious, intelligent and strongwilled candidates succeed. Before reaching the seniormost positions, all of them have to go through a variety of assignments starting from sub-divisional offices to the charge of district magistrate; secretarial assignments, spanning from deputy secretary to principal secretary; and often deputation posting in statutory bodies, public sector undertakings and sometimes, even international agencies.

 Given the similarity of work experience and almost identical merit in service career, the choice for the top post should normally present no difficulty with merit-cum-seniority as the guiding principle of selection. 

 No doubt the government would expect its top civil servant to be honest, efficient, full of drive and possess leadership qualities. But the government, being a political entity, would also like him not to be absolutely impartial, but closely aligned to the party in power or at least a bit pliable.

 Here lies the conflict of values between society and government, and a conscientious civil servant will have to exercise all his dexterity to strike a balance between the two. When the government changes at the end of five years, the civil servant can hope that his adherence to basic values in administration will gain appreciation. Where there is no such possibility of change in government and the same party remains in power for decades, ?neutrality? becomes a hindrance rather than an asset for a civil servant.

 What, then, should be the institutional mechanism through which the incumbent for the top-most post is selected? Needless to say, only officers with a proven record of excellence in service and absolute integrity are to be considered. The outgoing chief secretary, after examining the annual confidential reports of senior-most civil servants, draws up a list of candidates and places it before the chief minister, who is the final selecting authority. To assist the chief minister, a sub-committee of the cabinet may be formed, consisting of two or more very senior ministers. In a rare case, where none of the civil servants serving in the state is found suitable, the state government may request the government of India to send back a very senior officer from the state cadre serving it; and in the rarest of cases, an officer from outside the state cadre may be brought in.

 However, this procedure functions only in an ideal situation. In today?s political reality, the man for the top job is expected to be personally known to the chief minister and his senior colleagues. If, owing to exigencies of service, a civil servant stays out of the state for a considerable period and is not a familiar face in the corridors of power, there is little chance of his being selected, however outstanding his service record may be.

 Second, if the selection of the chief secretary is going to take place on the eve of an assembly election, it acquires a new dimension. Absolute loyalty to the party in power becomes the prime consideration. Any civil servant with doubtful allegiance to the ruling party is left out, however honest or efficient he may be.

 In some states, caste alone matters in the selection of the chief secretary; in some others, it is all-important whether the candidate can advance the interests of influential political leaders and their prot?g?s. Much supersession has taken place in many states, and the government of India, the final cadre-controlling authority of the IAS, has been a mute spectator. The superseded officers are happy to be granted pay equivalent to that of the chief secretary, but little thought has been given to the fact that the disappointment of senior officers not only affects the efficiency of the civil services but also erodes the values of honesty and impartiality in society.

 West Bengal, to a great extent, has been fortunate in this regard. Ever since independence, selection for the top-most post has been by and large fair, excepting one instance of supersession. Elections were approaching and the government had found no one suitable from the state cadre to fill the post though the rejected officers had occupied top positions like revenue secretary to the government of India; chairman, Damodar Valley Corporation; chairman, Industrial Reconstruction Bank of India and others. What advice did the chief secretary give to the chief minister? What decision did the cabinet sub-committee take, and why? Was any official request made to the government of India to bring back a junior officer, or was it simply an oral request made by an influential cabinet minister? Answers to these questions lie buried in the files of Writers? Buildings forever. Fortunately, the state government reverted to the normal process in later selections and one hopes that though elections are due next year, they will not influence selection this time.

 In the true blue tradition of the anonymity of civil services, I have refrained from naming any single person or any single party or any single outside state. However, I shall be failing in my duty if I do not share with the readers one case of selection of the chief secretary long in the past which will bring out the human element involved in the process of selection.

 B.C. Roy was then the chief minister and, after R. Gupta?s tenure as chief secretary, the choice was between K.K. Sen, the chairman of the Calcutta Improvement Trust, and M.M. Basu, the home secretary for many years. Both were outstanding civil servants. K.K. Sen was a year senior to Basu and his dedication to his duties was legendary. But Basu, because of his position, was very close to the chief minister. The file lay on Roy?s table for quite some time. When my father, who was secretary to the chief minister, went to gently remind him, he asked my father to call ?Karuna?. Roy used to call all senior officers by their first name. When Sen came, Roy congratulated him by saying that from tomorrow he would be addressed as honourable member, board of revenue. Perhaps there was a drop of tear in Sen?s eyes because he realized that he was not going to become chief secretary. But the magnanimity of Roy in personally calling him and informing him of the government decision in the sweetest possible way must have moved him.

 That was the golden age of administration of West Bengal, when senior civil servants knew that the political executive recognized and respected their merit. Can we bring back that culture of mutual respect in West Bengal again?

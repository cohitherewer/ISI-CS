 CHRIST rsquo;S: A CAMBRIDGE COLLEGE OVER FIVE 

 CENTURIES

 Edited by David Reynolds,

 Macmillan, pound; 25

 This book beckons to even those who have never been anywhere near Christ?s College, Cambridge. This is because the book is a collection of essays written by some of Britain?s best historians who were all alumni of Christ?s. Any book that has between its covers pieces by Quentin Skinner, Simon Schama, Barry Supple, Roy Porter, David Cannadine, Barrie Dobson and John Burrow cannot but attract the attention of all who are interested in good history writing.

 Christ?s College goes back to 1505 when it was founded with an endowment by Margaret Beaufort, the mother of Henry VII. But its history goes further back because the king mother?s munificence helped to build upon God?s House, an establishment set up under royal license in 1439 and then enlarged by Henry VI. But the 1505 establishment officially referred to as collegium Christi Universitatis Cantabrigiensis grew to be an important college in Cambridge which was vaulted into literature by C.P. Snow, who used the college as the locale of two of his novels, The Light and the Dark and The Masters.

 Dobson, a medievalist, tells the early history of Christ. Margaret Beaufort and her able ally, John Fisher, placed Christ?s on a sound financial foundation and made it a formidable academic institution. The harnessing of Lady Margaret?s lavish liberality was largely the work of John Fisher, who was a merchant?s son from East Riding. He came to Cambridge to study in Michaelhouse, a college that was merged with Trinity College when it was founded by Henry VIII in 1546. His rise was meteoric: he was Senior Proctor of the University at 23, Vice-Chancellor at 32, the first lady Margaret Professor of Divinity at 33 and then Chancellor of the University in 1504, an office that he held till the Reformation in England led to his execution in 1535.

 Without doubt, the most distinguished alumnus of Christ?s was John Milton. He came to the college in 1625, took his BA degree in 1628 and his MA in 1632. Skinner with his inimitable touch recreates the college and Cambridge as it was in Milton?s time. There are interesting vignettes of early Cambridge, the most memorable being the account of how the BA examination was conducted in Milton?s time. Skinner also provides the origin of the phrase Hobson?s Choice. Hobson was the University carrier ? a street north of Christ?s is still named after him ? and he hired out horses to students on the condition that they had to take whichever had been longest in the stable.

 It is a long jump from the age of Milton to the age of Jack Plumb, the historian whose name has become inextricably linked to Christ?s. The intervening years are covered by the essays of Porter, Burrow and Supple. Cannadine carries out a tour de force by capturing the history of Christ?s in the post-war years through the careers of the Nobel prize winning chemist, Alexander Todd, C.P. Snow and Jack Plumb. It is worth recording that the succession to the mastership of Christ?s after Plumb was as bitterly fought as the fictional one in Snow?s The Masters.

 The volume ends with an evocative essay by Schama, full of memories of tutorials with the great medievalist, Walter Ullman, and seminars with Plumb.

 It is difficult to think of another Oxbridge college which has produced a volume as rich as this in history, memory and analysis.

 RIGHT WAY TO LAND

 Land, like any other asset, is valuable only if the returns from it make good economic sense. Political and ideological debates over land often lose sight of this fundamental fact. No wonder that the debate over the West Bengal government?s move to do away with land ceilings has assumed political overtones. The facts are much simpler. Agricultural uses of land in India and in West Bengal in particular are known to be inefficient. Even the old idea of a country?s need for agricultural self-sufficiency no longer makes sense in a modern economy. Since the returns from land are so limited, it is a better idea to use land for commercial and industrial purposes. A robust economy would rather import grain with the money it makes from more efficient enterprises. In Bengal, though, the discussions on the uses of land centre around the distribution of small plots to poor farmers and ensuring their rights to land. Obviously, this has more to do with the politics of the vote than with economics. But, even their rights to land have not led to an economic revival in Bengal?s villages simply because traditional agriculture has not proved economically viable. Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s attempt to open up land to industrial and commercial enterprises is thus a step in the right direction. Better uses of land can attract domestic and foreign investments and thereby create new economic opportunities in the villages as well. 

 The case for withdrawing the ceiling on urban land is equally strong. Thousands of acres of land are locked in closed or sick industrial units located in urban areas. Most of them have simply outlived their usefulness as profitable business. But they continue to occupy the plots, thereby artificially pushing up the prices of urban land and real estate. Freeing such land and withdrawing the urban land ceiling are also essential for new commercial ventures. The logic prompted the Centre some years ago to withdraw the ceiling on urban land as part of the strategy for the National Urban Renewal Mission. Several states have since followed the Centre?s example. It is time that West Bengal not only freed the land locked in sick units but also did away with the urban land ceiling. In both urban and rural areas, the new approach could mean changes in the ?character? of the land. Only such radical changes can help Bengal enter the era of a more vibrant economy.

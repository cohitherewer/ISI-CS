 LEARNING TO STAY AFLOAT

 NEHA SAHAY

 Young girls, arms linked together, roam the streets of China?s new cities all day, shopping for trendy clothes. It makes you wonder ? shouldn?t they be studying, or in office?

 Twenty-year-old Wang Hua solved the mystery ? and gave a glimpse into the life of the working girl in the new, ?reform-driven? China.

 A ?captain? in a karaoke bar, Hua works from 8 pm to 5 am every night. Her job is that of a senior waitress; her salary, 1,200 yuan, plus dinner and a bed in a dorm. One of China?s migrant millions, Hua described her daily routine: after work, she washes her clothes (by hand, can?t afford a machine), bathes, watches TV, and finally drops off at 7 am. Wakes around 3.30-4 in the afternoon. Bathes again, gets dressed, and around 6.30 pm, eats a hot meal with her co-workers at her bar. By 8, they?ve finished cleaning the bar and are ready for the night. Hua saves a bit every month, though she does not avail herself of the free dorm but shares a 600-yuan-a-month rented kitchenette. She eats just once a day ? the free dinner ? and drinks some canned fruit juice (2 yuan). 

 Before this, Hua worked as a ?beer girl?. From 8 pm to midnight, she would wear a mini-skirt and jacket emblazoned with the name of the beer she was selling, carry small bottles in a tray slung from her neck, and circulate among diners. She earned 1,000 yuan, no food, no dorm, but a commission on every 100 bottles sold a night.

 Bring ?em in

 Commission is an integral part of Hua?s job. As a ?captain? she gets commission for every customer she ?calls? to her bar, if his bill exceeds 100 yuan. To be able to call customers, she must give them her mobile number (mobile to be bought at personal cost ? 800 yuan).

 Previously, Hua would tie up her black hair tight, and scrub her face clean, using no make-up. Now, she?s had a make-over: coloured and styled her hair so that it falls in curls around her face. While this has made her more attractive, she?s still far from competing with the average Chinese waitress, and hence must try hard to get customers interested enough to come back.

 One way is to talk to them, standing close enough to be heard over the loud music, and, if they insist, share a beer. Beer makes Hua sick, so she can?t do this for too long. But she has managed to get the calling cards of a few men.

 However, getting them to spend 100 yuan is more difficult, as a bottle of beer costs just 15 yuan and the heaviest meal not more than 35 yuan. It?s best therefore, to make friends with a group of men who might order a bucket of six bottles at 75 yuan.

 Small luxuries

 Hua is both happy and unhappy in her job. Happy because it gives her the illusion of being free the whole day. Actually, the only day she feels fit enough to go out before noon is the morning after her off-duty day ? she gets three offs a month. On these days, all she wants to do is have a good time with her friends, all of them night-shift waitresses like her.

 Just a year ago, Hua was a store assistant with one ambition: to learn English and ?develop? herself. Having learnt the basics in her village school (where, like most Chinese, she studied till Grade IX), she would try to master English grammar on her own with the help of English-Chinese books and tapes. She saved enough to enrol for computer classes and learnt quickly. But today, practising her skills seems too boring after being on her feet for 10 consecutive nights.

 The unhappiness comes from the commission bit ? she would rather not talk to strange men in various stages of drunkenness. But not being too ambitious, Hua has no complaints; her boss is kind, she has two bags full of clothes, her bank balance is increasing, and she feels ready to take on the world.

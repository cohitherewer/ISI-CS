 SHAKING HANDS

 Can a handshake alter the course of an epic conflict? The Israeli prime minister and Palestinian president have shaken hands in an Egyptian resort. They have jointly agreed to stop ?all? acts of violence against Israelis and Palestinians ?everywhere?. They have made what sound like promises to, and at, each other. But Mr Ariel Sharon has also qualified this apparently unequivocal stance. He has assured his Palestinian neighbours of Israel?s ?genuine intention? to respect their ?right to live independently and in dignity?. He has asked them, in the same breath, to ?abandon unrealistic dreams?. Mr Mahmoud Abbas has spoken of the Palestinians? longing for the day when the language of ?bullets and bombs? will be replaced by the language of ?dialogue?. Other nations ? Europe, Britain, Egypt, Jordan ? will wait and watch with ?guarded optimism?, as the British foreign secretary put it. The time seems opportune for such a handshake. Yasser Arafat is dead; his successor, reputedly moderate and better trusted by the Israelis, has been democratically elected. Mr George W. Bush has promised to spend ?political capital? on west Asia in his second term. Mr Sharon seems to be determined to pull out of the Gaza Strip. And, perhaps most important, ordinary people on either side of the violently disputed borders, are at the end of their tether. According to one estimate, since the second intifada began on September 28, 2000, 1,042 Israelis (727 of them civilians) and 3,579 Palestinians have died.

 Israel, however, is unwilling to call this a ceasefire and prefers to refer to it as an ?understanding?. Palestinians want to negotiate a final peace settlement, while the Israelis would want to see the extent to which Mr Abbas can convince Hamas and its suicide bombers against the use of terror. Only years of genuine quiet would make it possible to begin more difficult negotiations over the final borders, resettlement and compensation of refugees, and the freeing of Palestinian prisoners. But could any exchange conducted in a spirit of bargaining really bring peace and reverse decades of hostility and mistrust? A genuine ?political? solution can only be glimpsed when each side is willing to give up its perception of itself as the sole victim of the conflict, and acknowledge the other?s suffering. This will mean ? for both Israel and Palestine ? a radical realignment with history. Identities may be begotten in the past, but they can only be lived out in the present.

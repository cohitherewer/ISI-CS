 TESTING LIMITS

 What?s in the name of an electoral constituency? Nothing much, one would assume, unless it means the loss of more than a name. The opposition parties in Bengal fear that there is more to the delimitation of the state assembly and Lok Sabha constituencies than a mere change of names. It should not have otherwise bothered them or the voters if a constituency in Calcutta is to get a new name such as Bhowanipore or Calcutta Port. It is easy to see why Ms Mamata Banerjee is upset about the number of assembly seats in Calcutta dropping to 11 from the existing 21. The city and its neighbourhood remain the core area of strength for her party, the Trinamool Congress. The shrinking of Calcutta?s legislative profile, therefore, worries her. It is possible, though, to argue that her objections reflect more her own political insecurity than the alleged flaws of the delimitation process. After all, the delimitation commission, headed by the former Supreme Court judge, Mr Kuldeep Singh, has the same criterion for the delimitation of constituencies all over the country. It works on the principle that constituencies with low population growths should be shifted to areas with higher population growths. The idea was to ensure reasonably uniform representations of the population in the legislatures. 

 However, Ms Banerjee?s other objection deserves to be examined more seriously. She has complained that some districts on the India-Bangladesh border, which would now have a larger number of assembly seats, have an unusually high population growth because of the influx of Bangladeshis there. The voters? lists in these districts also have large numbers of these illegal settlers in them. This is not the first time that this complaint has been made. Nor is Ms Banerjee the first opposition leader to cry foul over voters? lists and the alleged Bangladeshis in them. In fact, she had earlier been rather lukewarm on the issue for fear of losing the support of Muslims during the elections. In Bengal, it was always the Bharatiya Janata Party which agitated on the issue. The left and the Congress, on the other hand, competed for the Muslim vote and thereby shied away from the debates. Irrespective of the politicians? motives, the complaint cannot be taken lightly. If foreigners infiltrate the voters? lists, it is a grave threat to both democracy and national security.

 IT TAKES TWO TO TANGO

 No looking back

 Tony and Cherie: A Special Relationship By Paul Scott, Sidgwick and Jackson, ? 17.99

 Labour broke its losing record when in Spring 1997, Tony Blair became Britain?s youngest prime minister in 180 years. When the Blairs moved into the prime ministerial residence of 10 Downing Street, Chancellor Gordon Brown generously exchanged his five-bedroom Number Eleven residence with the smaller flat above Number Ten, to accommodate the Blairs? family of five.The ambitious Cherie assumed the role of the silent housewife, hanging onto her husband?s arm rather reluctantly, partly to blunt Conservative criticism.

 In Cherie?s book, The Goldfish Bowl, she describes how not a single moment of their day is spent away from their office staff. Blair secured the Good Friday Agreement on peace in Ireland in 1998. International issues were high on his agenda.

 Cherie began privately taking a more active role in politics but there was some contention over Anji Hunter, Blair?s special assistant. The tabloids fought over who got the ?scoop? of Cherie?s last pregnancy. Euan, the Blairs? 16-year-old son, was arrested for drunken behaviour. Surprisingly, the event went on to improve Blair?s image of a family man.

 Enjoying the hospitality of their rich and famous friends and Cherie?s experimentation with holistic healing brought criticism on the Blairs as did Cherie?s setting up of a legal chamber, as it coincided with the new Human Rights Act, which brought lawyers many new cases.

 During the war in Afghanistan, Cherie openly discussed the atrocities committed by the taliban regime. Since she was not formally a member of the government, she conveniently did not need to explain her statements. The Blairs? stance on war in foreign lands stemmed from deep feelings aroused by the September 11 attacks.

 The preferential treatment the Blair children were given in securing places in coveted educational establishments was a sensitive issue. Then there were doubts about whether baby Leo had been given the controversial MMR vaccine being advocated by the government.

 In January 2002, eight weeks after the fall of Kabul, the Blairs flew secretly into Afghanistan on a daring trip to meet the new Afghan leader and to visit British troops. Cherie accompanied Tony on a trip to Asia and met women who had acid poured on their bodies. Her friends point out that the British press was not interested in highlighting this aspect of Cherie?s personality.

 In 2002, Cherie joined Queen Rania in an appeal to raise money for Palestinians at a time when the British government was pushing for a peaceful resolution to the Israel-Palestine conflict. The same year, Peter Foster, a charlatan, managed to charm his way into a relationship with Carole Caplin, Cherie?s style guru. He convinced Cherie that he would negotiate the purchase of two flats and save her millions! When the Daily Mail leaked this, the media accused the PM?s staff of obfuscation. Disheartened, Cherie turned to religion. Britain?s joining the Iraq war and the fiasco over WMD and David Kelly?s suicide put a lot of stress on the Blairs. Bush and Blair were left to seek solace in their faiths when their reputations took a beating. The ambitious Cherie made speeches in Australia to raise money for children?s charities. But these did not go down well with the people when they discovered that she would get paid for her services. In spite of Tony?s loss of credibility over the Iraq war, Labour under him managed to win a third term with a reduced majority.

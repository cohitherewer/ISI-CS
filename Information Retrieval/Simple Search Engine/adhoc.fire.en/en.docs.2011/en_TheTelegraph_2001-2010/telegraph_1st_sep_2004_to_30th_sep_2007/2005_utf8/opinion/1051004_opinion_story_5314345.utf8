 IT WAS JUST A KISS

 Malvika Singh

 What is obscenity? Surely it means different things to different people in varying contexts, particularly in a democratic society. But in Tamil Nadu, the definition appears to be warped. Love is being banned as rape runs rampant. Gestures of affection exude a carefree, pure happiness and have been an intrinsic part of the celebration of Indian tradition and culture. Radha and Krishna, Siva and Parvati, Laila and Majnu, Heer and Ranjha, Rupmati and Baz Bahadur ? gods and humans alike have represented this basic human emotion through myth, legend, painting and sculpture both religious and secular. It has been the supreme greatness of this ancient land. People flock to India to experience and be stimulated by love, something the West has sterilized. Why does some crude and unthinking official get away with attacking a fundamental trait of this land? It beats the imagination. We are burying our strengths as we adopt alien stances influenced by Victorian and other conservative positions. We are a free and vibrant people with less hang-ups than most other civilizations. Let us fight the petty ?officials? who intrude on this living reality that is our heritage. At this rate, Tamils may be banned from visiting the temples at Khajuraho!

 Tamil films, with heroines indulging in those endless vulgar gyrations, rolling with the heroes on the ground in wet saris, represent the contemporary culture of Tamil Nadu. Tamil television is saturated with such films. In comparison, a couple kissing on a dance floor in the private confines of a hotel, is seen by that administration to be ?obscene?. What fake morality, what utter hypocrisy! Their officers need to go back to school and learn about the country they misrule. They need to study the ancient treatises before they impose their ridiculous morality on India. We should rise above these superficial do?s and don?ts and get on with growth and real development. We should ensure that rapists go to jail forever, that eve-teasers are locked up. We should encourage people to hold hands and embrace each other.

 Strike at them

 It is this kind of official intrusion that makes India an impossible business destination. Corruption, political motivations, extortion, bribery ? all come together to haunt every businessman. Greed and envy have become the two pillars that trigger constant harassment. In the larger service sector that employs a vast number of workers, this non-stop needling carries on relentlessly. Bans and silly restrictions only endorse the ongoing bribery and open new avenues for corruption. The government has to respect its citizens, it has to assist entrepreneurs, to protect women from rape to bottom pinching, to restore dignity in the everyday lives of Indians. The environment has been polluted by our rulers. They have to purge themselves of all the illegitimacies that dominate their lives, or step away.

 The political obscenity that suffocated us and drained the exchequer was the CPI(M)?s strike. It was blackmail at its worst. It was the shrill call of those who had failed the systems and diluted public operations and recognized they had finally been exposed for gross ineptitude and inefficiency. They ran for cover to the left and their ?trade unions?. Those on the dole, motivated to do nothing, would surely support a close-down. 

 However, for a political party to lead this kind of destructive protest is unwarranted. It is not in government at the Centre. It is not held to account and is therefore wholly irresponsible. Instead of blackmail, their members should be debating around a table, using their intellect. This kind of ?politics? is obscene in my definition. The UPA should ignore them, compel them to forge a coalition with the BJP and others, and ring in their death knell.

 FOUR YEARS

 In terms of tragedy, it is impossible ? as well as prejudicial and insensitive ? to compare terrorist strikes, to say which is greater or greatest. But there are certain aspects of 9/11 that threaten to make it unforgettable for a long time, and four years since September 11, 2001 seem nothing in retrospect. The spectacle, the scale, the daring, the coolly reckless planning, the sinister patience, and the display of nightmarish horror and pain have inflicted one of the more hideous scars on the world?s memory. This is just one aspect of 9/11. Its outcome is the other aspect, although inextricable from the first. It is debatable whether the United States of America?s ?war against terror? and the worldwide ?coalition against terror? have begun to achieve what they had intended. It has been asked ? and the answer to the question is both self-evident and too late to bother about ? why the American state should suddenly wake up to terrorism after 9/11. However that may be, it is now time to assess how effective the worldwide efforts to shut down channels of material support to terrorist groups have been.

 The US?s attack on Afghanistan in the wake of 9/11 was seen as more reasonable than its attack on Iraq. The bloody fields of Iraq yet show no signs of drying. Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib have not improved the quality of the US?s credentials for those who regard its actions with distrust. It is in an exacerbation of distrust that 9/11 is also remembered. Surveys show that ordinary Muslims all over the world, including India, feel more vulnerable, more likely to be blamed whenever violence occurs. On the positive side, it has led to introspection within the community, a rethinking of the place of extremism in religious thought, a restatement of the abhorrence of violence in the faith, even worries about the lack of non-religious education in madrassahs. But the obvious political motivation behind the US?s choice of actions has not increased trust ? the attack on Iraq on, as it turned out, no grounds at all, its support for Israel, or its selective use of the term ?terrorist? and its selective valuation of the victims of terrorism. Big terror now seems to have been split into small single-mission units. A lot is needed to defeat this. But the unity against terror that could be achieved, to some extent, by crossing cultural divides through mutual understanding has remained elusive so far.

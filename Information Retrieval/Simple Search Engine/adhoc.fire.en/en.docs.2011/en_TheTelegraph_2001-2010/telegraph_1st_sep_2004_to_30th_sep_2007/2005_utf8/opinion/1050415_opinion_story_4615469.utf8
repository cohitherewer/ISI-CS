 BAD FORM

 There are two accepted conventions according to which all sports are played. One is that players must abide by the rules even if they appear to be unfair. The other is the axiom that the umpire?s decision is always final. Without these two conventions, the conduct of any game will become chaotic. In India, it is often the case that these conventions are disregarded on grounds of patriotism or some such unsportsmanlike belief. Take the recent case of Sourav Ganguly. After the one-day international against Pakistan held in Motera, Ganguly, the Indian captain, has been suspended for six ODIs because the Indian team failed to maintain the stipulated over rate. In other words, the Indian team had broken one of the rules they had agreed to play by. According to the rules, as the captain of the side, Ganguly has to pay the penalty. But this verdict has created a wave of disapproval and anger directed against the match referee, Chris Broad. Even the chief minister of West Bengal, Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, has taken his mind off affairs of great pitch and moment to comment on the unfairness of the verdict. It is difficult to understand what all the hot air is about. According to the appointed authority, a rule was broken, and he meted out what he considered to be an adequate penalty. The verdict may or may not be too severe but there is no denying that India did not bowl its quota of overs. The match referee did not buy the argument that there were mitigating circumstances to excuse the fewer number of overs bowled. If, indeed, the judgment on Ganguly is too harsh, then there is a process of appeal open to him. All these matters are for experts to decide. Yet such is the power of patriotism and fan following that everyone has an opinion on the matter and the opinions are mostly in favour of the Indian captain.

 Yet Ganguly is a frequent offender. He was penalized once before for slow over rate. On at least three other occasions, he has been suspended for showing dissent against decisions given by umpires. Such shows of dissent, as any lover of cricket knows ? or should know ? are a crass violation of the spirit of cricket. When Ganguly carries out such violations as a captain, he compounds his offence many times over since as the captain he is supposed to lead and set an example. Such a consideration may have played on Broad?s mind when he sat on judgment over Ganguly.

 There is one very important point that tends to get obfuscated in cases involving stars like Ganguly. Whatever be the status of the player involved, the game and the spirit in which it is played are much more important than any individual. Ganguly?s obvious popularity should not stand in the way of deciding what is good for the game. This will also relieve the pressure on Ganguly and facilitate the process of getting back his form.

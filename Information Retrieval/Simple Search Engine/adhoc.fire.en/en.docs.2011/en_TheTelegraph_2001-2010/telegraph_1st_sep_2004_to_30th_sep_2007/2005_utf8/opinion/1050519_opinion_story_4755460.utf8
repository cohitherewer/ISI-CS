 Letters to Editor

 Miss Mediocre

 Sir ? Mallika Sherawat has done nothing to deserve the gushing prose of the report, ?Lucky Jackie has Mallika? (May 18). She?s appeared as the sidekick of a B-grade actor in a C-grade film. Just because it?s Hollywood doesn?t mean we shut our eyes to the reality behind The Myth. How is Sherawat?s Indian princess called Samantha (of all things) any different from the Amrish Puri?s Mola Ram in Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom? What is most galling in all this is the way our media has been hanging on to Sherawat?s every word at the ?press conference?, as if she had become the new torch bearer of Indian cinema at Cannes. Fifty years ago, Pather Panchali showing at Cannes, and winning acclaim, was a big thing. But now, especially with the large-scale influx of Bollywood in the French seaside resort every year, Cannes is really no big deal. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Ray, Calcutta

 Birthday blues

 Sir ? The left parties supporting the United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre seem to be creating trouble for the Manmohan Singh government instead of helping it (?Birthday snub in Karat court?, May 13). Almost all the economic decisions taken by the government were necessary because they aimed to create wealth for the people and to develop the country rapidly. By opposing those moves, the left is blocking the progress of those very people whom it claims to represent. It is time the left showed some maturity and let the government work for the full term the way it wants to. Then let the people decide whether they are happy with the government. Since the left parties claim to be against the communal forces, they should take care not to help the Bharatiya Janata Party in any way.

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir ? Political pundits have heaped praise on Manmohan Singh, as if a revolutionary transformation has come about in the lives of Indians in his one year in office. This is surprising because Singh?s regime has been implicated in some indefensible manoeuvres aimed at politicizing key institutions of the government. How can we ignore what happened in Goa and Ranchi? The UPA partners are behaving in a restrained fashion today because it is in their interest to do so. Singh?s political skills have nothing to do with this. Laloo Prasad Yadav?s political drama at the site of a train accident which left many dead and Singh?s silence over the misdeeds of the left show that he has to work far harder to prove his abilities. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad 

 Sir ? Instead of 6 on 10, Manmohan Singh should rate himself more like 0/10 on areas like law and order, corruption among public servants, abuse of women and children, extortion, kidnapping, rape, insurgency, theft of public property, delays in judicial system, and so on. Of course, the BJP did no better.

 Yours faithfully,

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? Throughout this year, the UPA regime has indulged in the politics of vendetta ? whether it be the removal of governors appointed by the NDA or the de-saffronization of education. Parliament has been rocked again and again on issues like the induction of tainted ministers in the cabinet, the installation of Shibu Soren as chief minister in Jharkhand, but the government has been unfazed. For example, it did nothing to end the stalemate in the budget session, save request the opposition to come back to parliament. 

 Yours faithfully,

V. Krishnakumar, New Delhi 

 Sir ? The first responsibility of a government must be to protect the lives and property of citizens. The increasing crime rate in the country, especially in the capital, shows its dismal failure on this count. Nobody in the Lok Sabha has questioned the home minister about the rise in crimes. Instead of wasting their time and resources digging dirt on George Fernandes and Arun Shourie, the government should turn its attention to more serious issues.

 Yours faithfully,

C.V.K. Moorthy, Calcutta

 Sir ? Congress loyalists with little experience and administrative ability have been allocated ministries by the UPA regime. It is clear from this that the Congress is gradually returning to its old ways, to the time when Indira Gandhi ruled the roost. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kashi Nath Sanyal, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir ? It pains me to see the poor quality of headlines in The Telegraph. In a possible attempt to be brief and ?cool?, the editors churn out ludicrous lines. This sets a poor example for students who may think that such liberties with the English language are acceptable. For example, a scuffle at R.G. Kar Medical College Hostel is headlined, ?Hostel ado in berth blows wake? (May 17). Wouldn?t ?Trouble at Medical Students Hostel? or something more straightforward have sufficed?

 Yours faithfully, 

G. Murthi, London

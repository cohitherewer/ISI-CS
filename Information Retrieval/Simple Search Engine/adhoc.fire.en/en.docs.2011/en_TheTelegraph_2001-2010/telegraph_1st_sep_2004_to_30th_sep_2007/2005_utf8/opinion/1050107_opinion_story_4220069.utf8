 SECRETS OF THE GAME

 India tour England, 1952

 The covers are off: A socio-historical study of Indian 

 cricket, 1932-2003 

 By Rajan Bala, 

 Rupa, Rs 395

 The story of Indian cricket is 

 replete with intrigue, 

 provincialism and corruption. However, it is also inter

 spersed with tales of heroism, courage and sporting conduct. 

 To recount the story of Indian cricket, one has to be knowledgeable 

 and passionate about the game. And Rajan Bala is the ideal person to tell us this fascinating 

 story about Indian cricket and its play

 ers in the last seven decades.

Bala, who has been following Indian cricket since 

the Fifties, laces his book with humour, pathos, and rare insights into the history 

of the game. In this book, he takes the reader through the maze of Indian cricket 

like no one else.

 The book is full of interesting anecdotes. It also contradicts certain conventional ideas regarding Indian cricket. For instance, the great Parsi all-rounder, Mehelasha Pavri, has been quoted as saying that C.K. Nayudu?s captaincy left a lot to be desired. Former greats like Vijay Hazare and Chandu Borde are on record, accusing the players from Bombay of creating regional groups in the national team. Many cricket lovers would also be surprised to know that Vijay Hazare had once rebuked C.D. Gopinath of Tamil Nadu for not understanding Hindi! 

 However, Bala showers praise on players like Vinoo Mankad and Lala Amarnath. But, these world class cricketers could be acerbic while dealing with players, warns the author. According to Bala, Vijay Merchant the captain was extremely defensive, but Merchant the man was nothing short of a dictator. As the chairman of the national selection committee, he meddled with the selection process of state and zonal teams. Tiger Pataudi, says Bala, brought about a marked change in the approach of Indian cricketers. But Bala writes that he was not good at managing his players. 

 In his inimitable style, Bala assesses the strengths and weaknesses of contemporary players like Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid. Bala seems to favour the latter to the present Indian captain though. Unfortunately, the fact that Ganguly led from the front at a time when the game was in turmoil in India because of the match-fixing episode seems to have eluded Bala. He is also unwilling to admit that India owes much of its present cricketing success to Ganguly. 

 The book also focuses on the role played by Indian cricket administrators. Bala is right in saying that the first secretary, Anthony D?Mello, was an able administrator but a man who encouraged machinations and was ultimately consumed by it. Although most of the other officials make fleeting appearances in Bala?s book, Jagmohan Dalmiya is a name that keeps cropping up frequently. Dalmiya, the marketing guru, has moulded Indian cricket into an entertainment industry since the early Nineties. The credit of turning modern cricketers into billionaires goes solely to him. Dalmiya?s faith on the saleability of these cricketers has paid dividends for them, says Bala. 

 This is not to say that Bala?s book deals with the brighter aspects of Indian cricket only. He has not forgotten to mention that Indian cricket was, and still is, plagued by nepotism. And this has often gone against the interest of the country. Not only that, it has also ensured that numerous undeserving people, players and officials alike, are now perched on the top while deserving individuals have been relegated to the backbenches.

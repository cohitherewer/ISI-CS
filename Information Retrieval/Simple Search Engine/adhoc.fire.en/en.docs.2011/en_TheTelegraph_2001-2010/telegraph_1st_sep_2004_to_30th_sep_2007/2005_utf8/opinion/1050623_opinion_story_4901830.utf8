 STROKES OF A GENIUS

 OBITUARY

 Syed Mushtaq Ali (1914-2005)

 The first time I saw Syed Mushtaq Ali was at the Eden Gardens in the ?Defence Fund Match?, which was held following the India-China war in 1962. At the time in the early Sixties, Mushtaq Ali was nearing 50 and, most certainly, was out of cricket for more than a decade.

 In our childhood, I had heard how Mushtaq Ali would step out of his crease to even fast bowlers and glance or cut with ease. That was supposed to be his trademark stroke. It was difficult to believe that such a stroke was possible. I used to think that this was a mere exaggeration.

 Now, I was watching the 50-year-old former opener against the fastest bowler in the world at the time ? Roy Gilchrist of the West Indies. As Gilchrist, arms flailing, thundered in to deliver, Mushtaq Ali actually stepped a couple of yards out of his crease.

 Gilchrist, flabbergasted, did not release the ball. He ran down the pitch to Mushtaq Ali?s end, glared at him for a while and made a sign of the cross on Mushtaq Ali, as if signifying the target before turning back to bowl the next ball. Mushtaq Ali merely smiled and made a gesture of flicking a speck of dirt from his fluttering silk shirt.

 The whole episode was the height of showmanship. But this was no theatre. A spark had been ignited between the world?s fastest bowler and the world?s most adventurous batsman. The intervening moment throbbed with excitement: a fuming Gilchrist walking back to the top of his distant bowling mark; and Mushtaq, nonchalant and graceful, leaning on his bat for support.

 The next ball from the fearsome Gilchrist scorched the earth but the old man was again out of his crease in no time and flicked the rising delivery off his chest over square leg to the fence. It was a combination of raw courage, superlative coordination of hand and eye and a sense of adventure. 

 I had seen enough. I realized, there and then, the reason for generations of cricket-lovers to idolize Mushtaq Ali. He was not only a marvellous batsman, full of strokes and audacious nature, but he was much more. For him cricket was not only a game, but an adventure. If the adventure did not end in glory, there was no failure either. It was the sense of trying the impossible that set him apart from others. Never before or since has a batsman stepped out to the fastest of bowlers to cut the ball or to glance or to flick. 

 In 1993, Mushtaq Ali had come at the invitation of the Voluntary Blood Donors? Association to meet the blood donors at Eden Gardens. I happened to be one of them. After the blood donation camp was over, I invited Mushtaq Ali to the CAB indoor stadium to meet the Bengal under-16 team members, who were my wards. There, even before we could even request him, he volunteered to bat! He was nearing 80 at the time. Still ramrod straight and without an iota of excess fat, his statuesque bearing evoked instant admiration. Most of the bats he found rather heavy, as contemporary bats are. Finally, he picked up a comparatively light bat and was ready to face the bowling without any protective gear. I asked an off-spinner to bowl. Again he stepped out of his crease and this time he cut the ball with immaculate timing!

 It was not the rapier thrust of a cut. No, it was a whipping action of steely wrists. Simply amazing. At the age of 80, in totally alien conditions, how he managed to time the ball is beyond my comprehension. But he did it. We saw it and were mesmerized. Never before had he played under artificial lights. Never before had he played on artificial surface. Yet he revealed to us what genius really was. 

 Later, I requested him to advise me and my trainees. The modest man said, ?My philosophy is enjoy your cricket and give enjoyment to others. I have nothing else to say.? It was brilliant. In a nutshell, he told us what sport was all about.

 Mushtaq Ali?s contribution to cricket and cricketers can never be judged by statistical facts and figures. He belonged to a different genre. A breed that evoked passionate love among cricket-followers. The top two of this rare breed most certainly would be Keith Miller and Mushtaq Ali. They risked their fame and fortune to give entertainment to generations of cricket-lovers. They never cared for statistics, although their talent brought them phenomenal material success.

 Within the course of the last one year, both Keith Miller and Mushtaq Ali have left us.They have gone to the Elysian Fields. Will we ever get to see their like again?

 THE UNGAINLY RIGHT

 What is bothering the sangh parivar is less a question of personalities and more a dilemma over substance, writes Mahesh Rangarajan

 The laughter is on them

 Not since the time when the Bharatiya Janata Party was routed in the general elections of 1984 has the parent organization come down so hard on the saffron party. There is an echo of past criticisms: then, as now, Atal Bihari Vajpayee was in the dock for having strayed from the core message of Hindu sangathan or unity. Then, as now, the large fraternity was harshly critical of the middling, anti-Congressism that was the leitmotif of the party. If there had been a failure at the hustings, the remedy was easy enough to implement. Echoes are one matter, but we are not seeing a simple repeat of the past. For one, the BJP?s dual leadership has responded, and strongly so, to any attempts to downplay what it got done during its six years in office. It is also clear that K.S. Sudarshan is not as highly regarded as the late Balasaheb Deoras.

 The latter did not have to contend with a party that was its offspring and headed a federal government. The Vajpayee period was a moment of triumph for the movement of Hindutva. But it was also its moment of truth. As with any government in a parliamentary democracy, the ministers soon became far more powerful than the party general secretaries. The prime minister, never just a first-among-equals in India, came to dominate the party president, just as was the case in the old days of the Congress. 

 The BJP itself was merely the largest party in a multi-party coalition. Having come into being in 1980 on the dual membership issue, there was no question of severing links with the sangh. As Vajpayee said in Staten Island, he was and would remain a swayamsevak, a humble volunteer. Yet, there are several grades and kinds of volunteers. M. Venkaiah Naidu publicly recounted how, ?All of us are Vajpayee sevaks now.?

 That spell of the Vajpayee era ended once the National Democratic Alliance was voted out of power by the electorate. Advani, as leader of the opposition and as party president, has gone back to the tried and tested path. He evokes the message of Hindutva, which he hopes will inspire the cadre and unify a splintered leadership.

 There is grim irony when the supreme head of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh compares Vajpayee unfavourably to Indira Gandhi. From around 1983, the sangh developed its own strategy of sidelining the BJP: its cadre openly worked for the Congress in the Delhi metropolitan council elections and the following year for the ruling party in the general elections.

 What mattered was the platform that a party stood for. Labels did not count for as much. Insurgency in Kashmir and militancy in Punjab set the stage for a Hindu-centric discourse, which was ideal sub-soil for the sangh to strike roots in.

 The RSS has no such easy options open to it today. The Congress rules in alliance with a host of regional parties and runs a government propped up by the left. In the Sonia Gandhi era, which dates from the same year as the second Vajpayee government, the party has veered back to its older strategy of reaching out to the religious minorities, the under-classes and the poor. This tack has met with some, if not total success. If anything, the ability of the Congress in winning back the small, but heterogeneous and highly articulate middle classes in the urban pockets is what really unsettles the saffron party.

 It was easy in the Eighties and even in the Nineties for the sangh and the BJP to portray themselves as custodians of purity in public life. Even Ayodhya could be shaken off as a folly of an unfortunate moment. In today?s setting, the old slogans have a tired air about them. They also seem an anachronism. The fact is that the BJP failed to fully displace the Congress as the custodian of power. All it did was expand the acceptability of its own idiom of politics. It came to power less due to a ?Hindu vote bank? and more because a huge section of voters wanted to give it and its allies a chance. Now, instead of asking where it failed to meet expectations, its leaders are harking back to a slogan they were raised on.

 Sudarshan?s exhortation that the second line emerge from the chief ministers sounds more logical, but a closer look shows a more disconcerting picture. Narendra Modi, the man who led the party to a two-thirds majority in Gujarat in 2002 after what Asutosh Varshney calls ?the first state level pogrom in independent India?, is losing his hold on voters. Last year, the Bharatiya Jan Kisan Party was barely 2 per cent ahead of the Congress in its vote share, down from a 10 per cent lead three years ago. It is not only the minorities who feel insecure. Haren Pandya?s father still alleges that he is dissatisfied with the probe into his son?s assassination.

 Modi is out of touch with the wider changes in the body politic of India and the world, and he is not the only one. The party and its fraternal organizations worked themselves into a tizzy when Modi was denied a visa by the United States of America. Yet, the US ambassador?s statement was a clear signal that the party needs to do a rethink on how far Modi is an asset to it. After all, if it seeks to be seen as the future custodian of a democracy, it cannot continue to lionize a man who presided over a massacre. 

 If Modi is not a bright hope, it is worse for the other second-rung leaders. Many of the bright central leaders are members of the Rajya Sabha, possibly because they are unsure of winning a single seat to the Lok Sabha from any state. Uma Bharti, who won encomiums from the Nagpur leadership, is now a one-person opposition to her successor in Bhopal. Vasundhara Raje?s is a more restrained style of leadership, but she is yet to establish a presence beyond her own state.

 A serious setback in political fortunes has exposed the cracks within. If the saffronites are unable to occupy the space of an opposition, there are other claimants waiting in the wings. The leadership of both the party and the sangh is trapped in images of the past. One looks back wistfully to the days of the Ram temple movement; the other to the days when Vajpayee was the prime minister. Neither is able to grasp the new situation that manifests itself in the country.

 The steep decline in fortunes in north India, for instance, has much to do with the crystallization of caste-based politics that chipped away at the core voter base of the party. Far from being a unified phalanx of fraternal groups, the sangh and its most influential offshoot are rent by internal conflict.

 There is a crisis of direction. What is at stake is less a question of personalities or generations, and much more a genuine dilemma over substance.

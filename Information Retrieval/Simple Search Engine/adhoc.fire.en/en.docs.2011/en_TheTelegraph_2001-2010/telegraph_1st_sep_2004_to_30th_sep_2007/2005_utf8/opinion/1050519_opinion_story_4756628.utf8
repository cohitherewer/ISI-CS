 ANOTHER GAME

 A film star-cum-cricketer is irresistible. Aamir Khan exemplifies this best, playing the passionately indomitable Bhuvan in Lagaan. But he had a slight advantage over cricketers deciding to become film stars ? he is a professional actor first. A clever mingling of the two can be managed occasionally, as, for example, when England?s Derek Pringle played the captain of the Cambridge University athletic team in the film, Chariots of Fire. In India, though the doubly-charged attraction of the cricketer-turned-film-star has for long been a desired goal. That is convenient too, because the world of high-profile cricket is socially most comfortable with the world of the high-budget popular film. It is not surprising, therefore, that Mr Mahesh Bhatt should think of Shoaib Akhtar as a possible hero for a film soon to be produced. That Akhtar is not from India but from Pakistan gives the idea just that extra fillip of brotherliness fit for the times. Besides, Mr Bhatt has already had another cricketer, Mohsin Khan, star in one of his earlier films.

 In the context of the Indian cricketer?s fondness for performing on the silver screen, Akhtar?s refusal is a bit disconcerting. It comes across, refreshingly, as an assertion of his identity and seriousness as a cricketer. This is rather different from the aspiring film stars among Indian cricketers. But there are differences among them too. If Salim Durrani or Sunil Gavaskar performed before the camera to entertain themselves and others, the same could not be said of Ajay Jadeja, Vinod Kambli or Salil Ankola, all of whom needed another career as the first withered away. Besides, the world now is very different from that of Durrani?s. What begins with endorsements and occasional starry appearances may gradually become at least as promising as a career on the field. That could be reassuring ? and reassurance could be distracting. Akhtar seems to be determined to close such distracting options, even though his career, at the moment, is not looking its best. A hard choice is a good route to sharp performances.

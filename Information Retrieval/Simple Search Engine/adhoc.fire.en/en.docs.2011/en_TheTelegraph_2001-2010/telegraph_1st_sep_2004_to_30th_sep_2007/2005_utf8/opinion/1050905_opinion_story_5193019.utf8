 LEARN TO LIVE WITH EXAM PHOBIA

 Ardhendu Chatterjee

 Recent reports in the media about the suicides of schoolchildren who have ?failed?, or feel they have not lived up to the expectations of their parents, have deeply distressed those who frame our education policy. The draft National Curriculum Framework for School Education 2005, which the NCERT has recently come up with, contains a number of recommendations to reverse the stress of the pre-board and board examinations. Of these, the most path-breaking is the one that suggests board exams be made optional and the ?pass-fail? terminology be done away with.

 No doubt, young learners are much too stressed these days. The tyranny of tests ?weekly, monthly, half-yearly and annual ? haunts them day in and day out. And then, at the end of class X, comes the board exam which decides their future course of studies.

 But board exams have always been looked upon as demons, and always will be. But to say that they should be done away with or made optional amounts to suggesting that our children are far too delicate compared to their counterparts in other nations and at other times. So what?s new or especially stressful about today?s board exams? 

 Clearly those who prepared the draft report have overreacted to the stress factor among students with the proposed radical reform of exams. In spite of the many flaws in the present examination system, it is a time-tested means of assessing students on their knowledge. Its validity and reliability are globally recognized.

 Great leveller 

 Exams conducted by schools are no solution, for they are seldom uniform in standard. A school sets its question papers with an eye on the quality of its students. While elite schools have a higher standard, the rest design their question-papers keeping in mind the average and below-average pupils. In contrast, board exams offer a level playing field. Herein lies the universal acceptability of state education boards and the validity of the certificates issued by them. 

 The NCERT panel?s emphasis on internal assessment betrays its ignorance of ground realities. In a country where teachers and school authorities are affiliated to political parties and powerful local citizens, internal assessment can never be free and fair. Sometimes teachers play safe by awarding marks liberally, no matter what the academic abilities of a pupil. 

 Most teachers will agree that it is not time yet to say goodbye to board exams. What is badly needed is exam reform. The focus group on exam reforms, headed by the former University Grants Commission chairperson, Yash Pal, has correctly observed that the present crop of paper-setters is singularly ineffective. The defective and outmoded questions encourage students to memorize rather than to conceptualize their learning matter. Indeed, reasoning and creativity very often take the back seat to rote learning.

 In focus

 But the focus group?s prescription that 60 to 75 per cent of the questions should be multiple-choice will not help. It will only lead examinees to answer by guessing rather than by understanding. It may also encourage them to copy from and whisper answers to each other with the tacit connivance of invigilators. It would have been better had attempts been made to stem the rot in our examination system by drawing on the fruitful and practical suggestions of experienced teachers. 

 Making board exams optional will also not work. It will create two classes of students ? one elite, the other backward. The stigma of backwardness will live on and destroy the job prospects of ?second class? students.

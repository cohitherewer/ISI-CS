 CAPITAL CRIME

 The hideousness of a terror attack may perhaps only be assessed in terms of the uncountable: the measure of innocence, joy and expectation destroyed. To target shoppers, among whom there are ? inevitably ? a large number of women and children, on the eve of Diwali and Id, argues a heartlessness immeasurable by human standards. This is true of every such attack; the three blasts in Delhi are one more cruel illustration. The attacks were conducted with both precision and ease. The simplicity of the technique is terrifying; there were no suicide bombers in this series. It is an astonishing ? and devastating ? failure of security, implying in it an inadequacy of intelligence and a lack of coordination and foresight on the part of security personnel. Reportedly, the Centre had had some warning of possible attacks around this time, and there was, presumably, some sort of security alert. It is not enough to say that security was spread thin because of the alert. The target was the capital of the country. It has to be asked exactly what went so badly wrong, why there was such a lack of precise information and absence of clear thinking, why, in short, the police were caught on the back foot.

 Terrorists have managed to convey the sense of a code through repeated attacks all over the world. A series of blasts immediately raises the question about the significance of the day or time. It could be possible to see the attack as having been planned for the day on which the judgment on the attackers of the Red Fort was meant to have been made. The police had dismantled an explosive device earlier in the afternoon in Chandni Chowk; why could the connections and possibilities not have been thought out? The time was the height of the festive season, ideal ground for sowing hatred and discord, sowing death. Besides, terrorist organizations, according to intelligence inputs, were anxious to prove that they were as strong as ever in spite of the damage done to their numbers by the Kashmir earthquake, and in spite of a number of arrests, including that of a leader of the Jaish-e-Mohammed group implicated in the attack in Ayodhya last May. And the event of India and Pakistan evolving even a slightly better understanding would seriously threaten their business. The killers, whatever name they go by, have a lot of points to prove. The slightest lapse in security will add further to the body count.

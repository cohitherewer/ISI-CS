 PARIVAR POLICE

 Confusion has been worse confounded. If Mr L.K. Advani?s encomia about Mohammad Ali Jinnah left most people bewildered, his resignation from the post of president of the Bharatiya Janata Party might appear as an unintended coup de gr?ce to a party languishing under an ideological and a leadership crisis. Mr Advani declared Jinnah to be secular. It is difficult to understand why such a certificate should raise hackles unless the sangh parivar believes that debates in history are unwelcome and unnecessary. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the core constituent of the sangh parivar, and the Hindu Mahasabha and Jan Sangh, previous incarnations of the BJP, have always considered Jinnah to be a traitor to Mother India. Not only was he a Muslim but he also successfully campaigned as a Muslim to divide India. Mr Advani, ever since he joined the first shakha of the RSS in his youth, has had this gospel drilled into him. Suddenly, in the evening of his life, Mr Advani chose to renege on the gospel and become an admirer of Jinnah. This was too rich for the fire-eaters of the sangh parivar to stomach. Mr Advani?s resignation is an indicator of the intolerance of the sangh parivar and of its refusal to change its mindset.

 The resignation also marks the distance between a section of the BJP?s leadership and Hindutva. Leaders like Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee and, more recently, Mr Advani have been trying to place governance above ideology within the agenda of the BJP. It is significant that Mr Vajpayee has not approved of the harsh criticism the sangh parivar has directed at Mr Advani. With Mr Advani?s exit and Mr Vajpayee in a state of semi-retirement, the orientation of the BJP is again open to negotiation and dispute. It is evident that Nagpur, the RSS headquarters, will try to re-establish its control over the BJP. Mr Vajpayee had managed to take the BJP outside Nagpur?s tentacles. The sangh parivar must decide who it wants as a leader: someone of the stature of Mr Advani, or little men like Mr Narendra Modi and Mr Praveen Togadia.

 By the various pronouncements he made in Pakistan, Mr Advani sought to claim for himself a new image. He wanted to project himself as a leader not just of the Hindus but of all Indians; he wanted the people of Pakistan to see him not as a bigoted anti-Pakistani but as a statesman who thought of the entire subcontinent. The praise for Jinnah followed: Jinnah, a leader of the Muslims, was secular; so was Advani, a leader of the Hindus. Unfortunately for Mr Advani, his past has devoured his present and his future. It is sad that a leader of one of India?s major political parties had to resign because he praised Jinnah with every good reason.

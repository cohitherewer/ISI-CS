 GLOBAL PLAYERS

 The recent visit to Russia by the prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, must be viewed as part of a strategy to position India as a major player in international relations. The ostensible purpose of the visit was to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the victory of the Allied forces over Nazi Germany and the end of World War II in Europe. The Indian prime minister was amongst the 50 leaders who had gathered in Moscow to pay tribute to the millions of citizens from the former Soviet Union who were killed during the war. The larger objective behind Mr Singh?s visit was clearly to engage the heads of the governments of major powers at what appears to be a critical juncture in contemporary international relations. The most important meetings were clearly with the president of Russia, Mr Vladimir Putin, and the American president, Mr George W. Bush.

 The discussions with the two leaders are believed to have been ?far more productive? than anticipated. Issues related to energy and weapons of mass destruction were clearly on top of the agenda. India faces tremendous challenges in the import of civilian nuclear technology. The nuclear suppliers group is still not considering India for membership, nor is it willing to ease its guidelines to facilitate nuclear energy cooperation with India. However, there has finally been some movement, and understandably the prime minister sought some assurances from the two leaders. Two nuclear reactors in Koodankulam in Tamil Nadu are being built with Russian help, and India clearly hopes that this cooperation would be further expanded. Even the possibility of Russia supplying nuclear fuel to Tarapur, which Moscow had ruled out earlier, is ?in the pipeline?. 

 Energy cooperation seemed to have figured prominently even in the short interaction Mr Singh had with the president of the United States of America. The American president is believed to have promised ?great things? when the Indian prime minister visits Washington in July. Clearly, India wants a speedy translation of the vision presented in the next steps in strategic partnership into ground reality. The prime minister is believed to have reassured world leaders regarding India?s non-proliferation commitments and also referred to the weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems (prohibition of unlawful activities) bill, which has been cleared by the Union cabinet and will soon be tabled in parliament. The Russia visit gave one more opportunity for India to project itself as a global player, and Mr Singh seems to have done the job well.

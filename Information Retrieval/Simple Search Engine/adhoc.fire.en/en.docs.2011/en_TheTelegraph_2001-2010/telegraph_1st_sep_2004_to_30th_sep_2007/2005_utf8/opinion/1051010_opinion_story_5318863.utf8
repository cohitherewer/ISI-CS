 COLLECTIVE WISDOM 

A. Gopalakrishnan underlines a course of action 

that will resolve the Iran issue and also help India regain international respect

 Bone of contention 

After taking the surprising step of voting at the 

International Atomic Energy Agency in favour of referring Iran to the United Nations 

security council, India appears to be gearing up to adhere to this position at 

the IAEA?s November meeting, despite the mounting opposition within the country. 

At the very least, the Indian decision exhibits a serious paucity of strategic 

thinking and diplomatic skill within the prime minister?s office and the ministry 

of external affairs. Many have commented on the motives behind the Indian vote, 

but what is required now are intelligent suggestions on possible solutions. This 

article is an attempt to examine certain relevant and related facts which point 

towards a possible initial approach to resolve the problem.

Much of the current allegations against Iran is baseless. 

The major difference of opinion which persists between Iran and the Western nations 

is about whether Iran can be permitted to have uranium enrichment facilities of 

its own for producing low-enriched uranium for power-reactor fuelling. If Iran 

is to have control of its low-enriched uranium supply, the only thing the world 

needs to ensure is that it does not lead to a diversion of that material for subsequent 

upgradation and use in a nuclear weapons programme, in Iran or outside.

In October 2003, Mohamed El-Baradei, director general 

of the IAEA, had made the following proposal in an article in The Economist, 

?It is time to limit the production of new material through reprocessing and enrichment, 

by agreeing to restrict these operations exclusively to facilities under multinational 

control...Such a framework should be inclusive: nuclear-weapon states, non-nuclear 

weapon states, and those outside the current non-proliferation regime should all 

have a seat at the table.? 

Subsequently, the IAEA formed an international group 

of experts to consider the possible multilateral approaches to the civilian nuclear 

fuel cycle. This group on Multilateral Nuclear Approaches under Bruno Pellaud, 

submitted a comprehensive report to the IAEA in February 2005. One of the five 

approaches suggested in its findings is ?creating, through voluntary agreements 

and contracts, multinational, and in particular regional, MNAs for new facilities 

based on joint ownership, drawing rights or co-management for facilities such 

as uranium enrichment, reprocessing.?

The earliest mention of multilateral management of 

sensitive nuclear operations dates back to the Baruch Plan presented to the UN 

in 1946. The IAEA, ever since its creation in 1957, continued to be interested 

in this approach. As early as in 1972, two separate multilateral uranium-enrichment 

consortia ? the Urenco and the Eurodif ? were formed. Eurodif runs a single facility 

in France, but has five countries investing and managing it. Urenco has three 

participating nations, with one facility in each country. 

Ironically, in 1975, Iran was accepted as a partner 

in EURODIF, and it paid one billion dollars to buy a 10 per cent share of the 

ownership. But, after the Iranian revolution in 1979, Iran was not given any enriched 

uranium, nor did it get back its investment from Eurodif.

In his address to the UN on September 17, 2005, the 

Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, said, ?Peaceful use of nuclear energy 

without possession of nuclear fuel cycle is an empty proposition. Nuclear power 

plants can indeed lead to total dependence of countries and peoples if they need 

to rely for their fuel on coercive (external) powers... No popularly elected and 

responsible government can consider such a situation in the interest of its people.? 

In today?s circumstances especially, the words of the Iranian president apply 

equally to India. India must desist from importing foreign nuclear reactors unless 

it also has multilaterally-assured fuel-supply arrangements for the 40-50 year 

lifetime of such reactors. In the light of this, MNAs become equally vital for 

India, even if the present Indo-US cooperation deal is approved.

The Iranian president also made a constructive proposal 

in his speech, on the basis of which India and the international community must 

attempt to construct a viable solution that is acceptable to all. He said, ?As 

a further confidence building measure and in order to provide the greatest degree 

of transparency, Iran is prepared to engage in serious partnership with private 

and public sectors of other countries in the implementation of uranium enrichment 

program in Iran.?

In view of the above, I would urge the government 

of India to seriously consider the following approach, with appropriate modifications 

if need be, for immediate implementation:

One, India should consider initiating and participating 

in the setting up and operation of a regional uranium enrichment facility, to 

be built in Iran with joint financial investments and collective management by 

a consortium consisting of India, Iran, Russia and South Africa. An appropriate 

enrichment plant supplier may be identified by the consortia and suitable terms 

and conditions for setting up an enrichment plant finalized in consultation with 

the director-general of the IAEA. 

Once the plans for constructing the RUEF are finalized, 

Iran must dismantle all its national uranium enrichment facilities and associated 

developmental programmes. The governing board of the RUEF must consist of representatives 

of the consortium countries and a senior nominee of the IAEA. All facilities and 

operations of the RUEF must be subject to IAEA safeguards and its Additional Protocol. 

While the plant must be operated and maintained mostly by personnel from the consortium 

nations, the required training and provision of spare-parts and services must 

be assured by the supplier under a long-term contract.

Two, India must immediately start consultations with 

Iran, Russia and South Africa to first get their concurrence in principle for 

this approach. Next, jointly with these partners, India must take the lead in 

seeking the support for this idea from the nonaligned countries, China and others 

in the IAEA board. Only after ensuring a wide enough support base from all these 

quarters should India and the consortium partners open a formal dialogue with 

the United States of America, the United Kingdom, France and Germany to get their 

concurrence. 

Whether or not their concurrence is forthcoming, India 

should introduce a suitable resolution, co-sponsored by the consortium partners, 

at the November 2005 meeting of the IAEA board. This resolution should seek the 

minimum time required to prepare the details of such a consortium for subsequent 

placement before the board. Simultaneously, the Indian resolution should also 

seek the postponement of any referral of Iran to the UN security council until 

after discussions are held on the detailed proposal of the consortium. In the 

interim, Iran must simultaneously agree to return to the Additional-Protocol provisions 

and not to initiate any activities towards enrichment, or the construction of 

its heavy-water reactor or reprocessing test facilities.

With the above move, India could regain lost ground 

on Iran and earn back the respect it lost internationally owing to its recent 

actions. Whether or not the US agrees to the above move, India must present the 

resolution at the IAEA and not surrender its right to pursue an independent foreign 

policy once again.

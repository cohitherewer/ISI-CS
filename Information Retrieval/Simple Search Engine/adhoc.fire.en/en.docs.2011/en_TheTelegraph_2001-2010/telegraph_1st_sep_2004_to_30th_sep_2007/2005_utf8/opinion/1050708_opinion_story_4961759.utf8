 SLOW DECAY

 Slow reformers end up changing too little too late. The case of the Great Eastern Hotel could prove this once again. The intransigence of the employees? unions notwithstanding, the long and uncertain way to the hotel?s privatization was primarily due to the Bengal government?s many indecisions. The Marxists were long unsure of the reformist policies that called for the privatization of such state enterprises. Hence, the half measures that they tried in order to solve such problems. Even the unions? opposition to the sale of the hotel was a legacy of the old leftist faith in the state?s right ? and supposed ability ? to run everything. Over the years, though, the faith had degenerated into vested interests and a total lack of vision. Only this can explain why the government wasted public money to run a hotel that was clearly dysfunctional and decaying. The seemingly endless wranglings over the voluntary retirement schemes offered to the employees could barely hide the colossal losses that the hotel incurred to the state exchequer. Only superficially, the issue was one of mismanagement of a hotel; the fundamental question was that of economic vision and policy priorities. No doubt that the government bungled too long on the basics. 

 There are a few lessons from the Great Eastern muddle that Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s government needs to learn urgently. First, an indecisive government is no good for the investor?s faith. The chief minister?s many pronouncements have raised hopes for his reformist agenda. But he needs to show stronger evidence of his ability to carry out these reforms fast enough. He cannot expect the investors to wait and watch as he sorts out his political problems. Second, the government?s troubles with the hotel?s privatization should make it change its strategies for other state-owned enterprises. Scores of them continue to be huge drains on the resources of a near-bankrupt state economy. Mr Bhattacharjee cannot afford to waste any more time on splitting hairs on the possibility of reviving the sick units. He must accept that the government has little justification in even trying to run businesses. It simply is not the government?s business. Even the argument of protecting jobs through such enterprises is pathetically flawed. The state can do much better by trying to create conditions that would foster economic growth and thereby create many more jobs.

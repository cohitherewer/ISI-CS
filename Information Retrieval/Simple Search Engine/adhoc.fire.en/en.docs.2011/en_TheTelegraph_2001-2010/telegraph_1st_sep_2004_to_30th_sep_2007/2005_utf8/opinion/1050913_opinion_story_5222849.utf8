 Letters to Editor

 Status-conscious

 Sir ? I am amazed by the West Bengal government?s apparent disinterest in the Centre?s proposal to upgrade two of the best institutions in the state to the status of Indian Institutes of Technology (?Twin-IIT offer leaves Bengal cold?, Sept 2). While other states would jump at this proposal, the Bengal administration is busy weighing the pros and cons. There could be two reasons for this dragging of feet. First, an IIT-status would mean conceding total control of the institutions to the Centre. Second, entrance to the institutes would be through an all-India competitive examination, which would reduce chances of students from West Bengal of getting admission, as there could be no reservation for Bengal in any IIT. But these are narrow-minded concerns. Good institutions should be open to students from all over the country, and not Bengal alone. As far as control is concerned, there are other ways through which the left can retain its control over the state. The academic institutions should be left alone.

 Refusing the Centre?s proposal would be a most illogical decision. It would not only mean refusal of a most highly coveted honour, but it would also mean further impeding the progress of education in the state. The chief minister has of late been doing a lot for Bengal, even to the extent of going against his colleagues in the politburo. In this matter, he must also take a broader view of things and convince his party about the decision. Most important, he must act fast. Delaying things has been a left trademark. But there are other states in queue this time, and they will not miss the chance West Bengal has been so cavalier about.

 Yours faithfully,

Sourav Sengupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? That the Centre has decided to upgrade the Bengal University of Engineering Science to an IIT is all very encouraging. But the recent clashes in the college, leading to an indefinite strike, raises serious questions about the decision. Apart from the institute?s infrastructure and standard of its faculty, the discipline among students and the college administration should also be considered. The authorities should realize that IITs have a worldwide reputation for their standard and the capability of their students. The fact that IITs produce the best engineers in the country, and even perhaps the world, is beyond doubt. Discipline and sincerity form a major role in their success. It seems that the students of BE college are more sincere about their politics than academics.

 I would like to raise certain questions about the Centre?s decision. How is it that anti-social elements can freely enter the BE College premises and harass students for their political affiliation? If politics is what is causing the turmoil, why hasn?t the students? union been pulled up? Why is politics allowed to interfere with education? 

 I am a student of IIT Kharagpur. There is no students? union in IIT Kharagpur. Neither is there any political interference in the campus. We have a common students? body called the Technology Students? Gymkhana. The office-bearers represent us in the senate ? the law making body. Students never feel that their interests are being harmed. In fact, there has been consistent overall development of IIT. Finally, one should know that the industry would not accept personnel with a violent political background. They would not like their officers to go on a strike every other day with foolish demands. As far as the development of the BE College is concerned, it can be done even without upgrading it to a IIT, especially in a state which already has one.

 Yours faithfully,

Rahul Dasgupta, Kharagpur

 Sir ? One cannot but be surprised by the state government?s lack of pragmatism with respect to the decision on granting IIT status to the BE College and Jadavpur University. This, in fact, should have been a matter of pride. Two additional IITs in West Bengal would not only have helped bridge the gap in the education system in Bengal, but it would have help- ed foster growth in the fields of science and technology, in which the state has been falling behind the rest of the country despite producing the best minds. 

 Yours faithfully,

Anindya Sengupta, Connecticut, US

 Sir ?The reluctance of the Bengal government to upgrade Jadavpur University and BE College to IITs proves how politics determines the standard of education in West Bengal. Most obviously, the government?s reaction is explained by the fact that handing over control of these colleges would mean an end to the dominance of the Students? Federation of India. But the callousness of the government will further degrade education in the state which has already forced bright students to migrate elsewhere. 

 Yours faithfully,

Avishek Ganguly, Howrah

 Sir ? It is unbelievable that the ruling Left Front should be dragging its feet over accepting the Centre?s offer. It will be a great loss for the state if the offer is withdrawn and the IIT status granted to some other institution in some other state in the list. The left has done enough damage to the education system in the state. It should stop blocking advance in any field.

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

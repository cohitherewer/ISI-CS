 ROTTING AWAY WITHIN

 MALVIKA SINGH

 Sting upon sting revealing some political representatives of the Indian people brazenly taking illegal ?remuneration? for doing their legitimate jobs. It is truly sickening, because it proves without doubt that the institution of parliament has, within its portals, members who blatantly defy their oath of office, placing their sticky paws on either a copy of the Constitution of India or a religious book. Those at the ?top? of this pyramid of corruption, coercion, wrongdoing, sit in both houses of parliament as rulers and as opposition members. Therefore, they must all go through the scanner and be exposed or lauded as the case may be. The speaker, along with the prime minister and the leader of the opposition, must ensure the dignity of the house and, in turn, the dignity of life, work and living for the Indian people. That is their job and they are paid to do so. Small wonder that adjournments have become the norm as the fundamental premise of parliament is being abused. They are guilty and know it.

 There has been a relentless destruction of democratic values, an active crusade by many governments in support of numerous issues that defy the law, all being led, ironically, by elected representatives who are in office to uphold and not dilute the laws of this land. Wherever you look, there is this bizarre reality hitting us in the face. They make the law and they merrily break the law, and when they do not agree with a view of an individual or group, they use that same law to harass. Enough of this malpractice and thank the lord these people are beginning to be exposed for what they are doing to this great civilization. Land mafias, timber mafias on one end of the spectrum and petty administrators who service the myriad wrongs at the other end, all have their political baaps who protect them. It is common knowledge across this nation state. 

 Hollow structures

 Look at the farce in Delhi. Extensions of homes and offices, illegally ?sanctioned? by the municipalities through bribery, have been ordered by the courts to be demolished. Why should those who knowingly broke the law through corrupt practice be spared? Why should the government support all those who have killed and choked this city with their illegalities? Senior and junior officers in the municipalities and in the police should be expelled from service forever for being accomplices in breaking the law. If the government acts honestly with those who were bribed to look the other way, the cleansing process will begin. But alas, how can it when the irregular structures in the homes of cabinet members to begin with, are there for all to see? It all begins at the top. That is from where the agenda has to be set. The prime minister should order the demolition of all makeshift office spaces et al from Lutyenss Delhi, overnight. Let members of the cabinet rent spaces in commercial areas as evening offices if they so choose. Why are they being allowed to destroy the environs of Delhi? 

 This dreadful chicken-and-egg situation needs to be fumigated once and for all. Politicians know well that after some hue and cry in the press, such issues die a natural death because every area of social and economic activity is ridden with corruption. It is the true way of life in India. It seems to have become our overriding faith. Why is the government at the Centre silent? Why is it in supreme denial about such fundamental issues? At midnight on December 31, the prime minister should swear his allegiance to honesty and integrity, to satyameva jayate, and promise his constituents, the people of India, that before governments accuse Indian citizens of malpractice, he will begin to eject the corrupt from the political and administrative space first. He must show his paces and his resolve to initiate dignity in the social order.

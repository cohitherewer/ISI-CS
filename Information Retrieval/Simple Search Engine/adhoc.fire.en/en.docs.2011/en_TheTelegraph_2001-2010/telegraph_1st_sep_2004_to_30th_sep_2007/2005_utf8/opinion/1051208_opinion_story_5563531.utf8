 Letters to Editor

 Night out

 Sir ? Barbarism is on the rise in West Bengal and the mass hysteria in Behala, that led to the mob attack on a family, is only the latest example of such incidents now happening at regular intervals throughout the state (?Boy killing spawns avenging beast?, Dec 3). It is a fact that people are gradually becoming more impatient, apathetic and cruel by the day. And the failure of the law-enforcing machinery and people?s loss of faith in the criminal justice system have aggravated such irresponsible mass behaviour. People now take law into their own hands at the slightest pretext, without ever thinking that it might add to the injustice. The Left Front, particularly the Communist Party of India (Marxist), is responsible for sowing the seeds of such mob behaviour in the state, and for using it as a tool to spread and increase its power base. The police department has been made into its stooge which acts only on the direction of the party bosses and to the advantage of the ruling party. The result is a qualitative degradation of values in the entire society. The Behala incident is not the last of such brutality in the city. Rural Bengal, in fact, is already in its grips.

 Yours faithfully,

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Calcutta probably has never before witnessed so cruel a murder and such violent a mob reaction (?Midnight?s children?, Dec 4). The death of Bela Bose has, in fact, made the case more difficult. But why was she burnt to death in the midnight rampage? Was it done to suppress evidence that would have indicated a different story? Or was it just the mob playing the arbiter of justice? In India, according to one estimate, not even 7 per cent of criminal cases end in a conviction. Quite naturally, the rule of the mob has become a parallel system of justice. As for the police, they are today a totally criminalized and politicized force. So people can hardly expect anything from them. 

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Das Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is shocking that in a place where Children?s Day is celebrated with such fervour, the little ones are becoming easy preys of society. The events last week and the reports that followed show that people have suddenly turned diabolically vindictive and are taking law into their hands. In this case, a woman has been burnt just on the basis of suspicion. Why are we forgetting that brutality is never a solution to any problem? On the contrary, it sends the wrong signals to people. It is intriguing that no political party in West Bengal has vocally protested against this misdemeanour. Perhaps they are waiting to give a political dimension to the matter. Yet, it is their responsibility to raise their voice against the breakdown of law and order.

 Yours faithfully,

Tanmoy Bhattacharjee, Howrah

 Sir ? In an age when arch-enemies India and Pakistan have realized the importance of good neighbourliness, the murder of Rick Nath by his neighbours is truly heartbreaking. The killing of an innocent child for a trivial property dispute reflects man?s inherent barbarity, and so does the subsequent act of putting Bela and Rabindra Nath Bose on fire. If Bela Bose?s merciless killing of Rick was horrible, then the crowd?s action later in the night was uncivilized as well.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Nivedita Roy Chowdhury, Calcutta 

 Sir ? How could the people living in that area in Behala have allowed the carnage to happen, and that too after the death of a neighbourhood boy? What sort of people are they? What was worse was the media attention the late night event got. Is there any way Calcutta can be saved from becoming an uncivilized city?

 Yours faithfully,

S. Mukherjee, Hyderabad 

 Sir ? One can hardly find adequate words to express the disgust and horror at the complete degeneration of civilized norms in Behala after the murder of a five-year-old child. The incident will be forgotten after a few days, like so many others are, but the administration at the highest level should think deeply about why some people often stoop to such abominable levels. There is hardly any respect for the state authorities. What will happen after investigations reveal that the Bose family is innocent? This single incident washes away any claim of progress and development by the party that has been at the helm of the state administration for the last quarter of a century.

 Yours faithfully,

Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

 Sir ? The bestial act in Behala is not an isolated event in West Bengal. The youth in West Bengal have learnt the culture of ?mob rule? from their political leaders. I have not found a single friend or relative who does not criticize the left rule in West Bengal. I have not seen any educated parents who have not tried to send their sons or daughters either abroad or outside West Bengal. It is my understanding that West Bengal is run by politicians who have a tunnel vision as they are not well-educated. They only know how to gherao a principal, headmaster, bank manager, factory or hospital superintendents and similar heads of any organization who did not see eye to eye with them. Their actions have resulted in either closure and or flight of factories from the state. 

 Yours faithfully

Sunil Kumar Pal, London

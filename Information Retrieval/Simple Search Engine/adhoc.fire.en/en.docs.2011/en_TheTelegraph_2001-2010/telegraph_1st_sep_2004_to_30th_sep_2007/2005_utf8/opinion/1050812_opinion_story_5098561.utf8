 Letters to Editor

 Injustice comes of age

 Sir ? Yes, Mannmohan Singh has assured that those guilty of perpetrating violence against the Sikhs in 1984 will be punished after a fresh probe; Jagdish Tytler too has resigned. But why didn?t the Congress sack him earlier? The Congress is the best bet for secularism in India. Thus it was very shocking to see it trying to get round the Nanavati commission?s report on technical grounds to save its partymen. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad

 Sir ? The anti-Sikh riots of 1984 that followed the assassination of Indira Gandhi led to the death of over 2,500 persons. Thus the prime minister?s concession in Parliament that those named in the Nanavati report would be investigated afresh is welcome. But to exclude H.K.L. Bhagat, because he is old and inactive in politics now, is a travesty yet again. How thorough was the investigation into his role? 

 Yours faithfully,

N. Narasimhan, Bangalore 

 Sir ? Shivraj Patil has downplayed the findings of the Nanavati report by saying that only ?local level leaders? of the Congress were found to have been involved. Nor does any high law-enforcement official appear to have been guilty, even of dereliction of duty. Nanavati has said clearly that he had to go by the evidence placed before him; and we know how common and easy it is to have statements withdrawn or changed, or simply to not record them. It is also a fact that political parties and police forces have chains of command and rules which ensure that those low down cannot act without the knowledge, permission or assistance of their higher-ups. The minister, though, stops the buck very low indeed. I wonder if he would care to explain it all in a ?Why Action Is Not To Be Taken Report?, in public interest, of which he speaks constantly.

 Yours faithfully,

Mukul Dube, Delhi

 Sir ? Eight inquiries in 21 years haven?t harmed any of the culprits of the 1984 massacre of Sikhs. Then why expect anything out of the ordinary from Justice G.T. Nanavati? After all, like all the other eight commissions before his, this one too is composed of the judiciary which cannot be entirely free of the political dispensation of the times. 

 Also, what was the need to establish a commission, since Rajiv Gandhi had openly said in November 1984 that when a big tree falls, the earth around it shakes. That sentiment speaks a lot, doesn?t it? 

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? The fact that 20 years after the Sikh riots we now have this ambiguous report, calls for serious reflection on the functions and responsibilities of commissions. Unless a time frame, a maximum of one year, is given them, the prime business of commissions, to bring justice to the affected, will go unfulfilled. 

 One can be sure that the Indian Constitution will be made a mockery of again when the report on the Gujarat riots is released, say in 2020, by the same judge, when perhaps all accused are no more.

 Yours faithfully,

Amber Warsi, Calcutta

 Sir ? No matter which party is at the helm at the Centre, politicians have proved time and again that when it comes to shielding and even abetting the criminal activities of members of their own party, they are second to none. By refusing to act on the Nanavati commission report, the UPA government has certainly not surprised the people of India, who have come to believe that justice is seldom done or even seen to be done. Even the NDA, when it was in power, went out of its way to shield its members and allies, whether it was in the Babri Masjid demolition, the Gujarat riots, the coffin scam or the Tehelka scandal. I wonder why the government wastes public money and time by constituting commissions? What?s worse, the Indian voter ? caught between the devil and the deep blue sea ? can do nothing to mend this state of affairs. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sucheta Chatterjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? The trauma of 1984 will never vanish until justice is done. The report of the Nanavati commission inquiry has phrases like ?very probably? when it refers to so-and-so minister who was involved in the 1984 riots. The phrase is an indication of the said minister?s involvement in the riots. At the same time, the phrase would almost seem to provide an escape in a hostile political climate. 

 Justice will come only when there is political will. A majority community will always have the numbers and muscle power on its side. Unfortunately as in this case, it may lack the urge to do justice to a minority community. But a society which is protecting its criminals for the only reason that they are political heavyweights from the majority community is probably doing more harm to itself than anyone else. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kulmohan Arora, Southampton, UK

 Sir ? Intelligence agencies had warned Indira Gandhi to remove Sikh bodyguards from her inner security ring after Operation Blue Star. But Indira Gandhi refused to oblige, as it would have meant singling out a particular community among her bodyguards. But what her Congress supporters did after her death was exactly the opposite. The government is sending a wrong signal by not initiating action against the known culprits. 

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

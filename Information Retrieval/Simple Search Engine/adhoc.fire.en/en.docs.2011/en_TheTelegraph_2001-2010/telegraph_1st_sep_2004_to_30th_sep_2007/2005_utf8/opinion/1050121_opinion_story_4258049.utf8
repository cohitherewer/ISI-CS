 Letters to Editor

 The illogic of numbers

 Sir ? It is a pity that the prime minister of a government that talks about compassion and claims to be sensitive to minority rights dismisses same-sex marriages outright on the grounds that they would not have wide acceptance (?Umm...what same sex??, Jan 19). The basis of equality and constitutional rights is to give protection to persecuted minorities that they do not get through the democratic process where the majority dominates. The Congress and the left need to come clean on queer rights. The Shiv Sena opposing Fire is understandable, at least they are not being hypocrites ? but is the Indian left-liberal crowd willing to confront the question of gay and lesbian rights head on? This is the real test of their so-called inclusive ideologies ? knee-jerk reactions like that of the prime minister will only take them closer to the right, whom they so dislike, and away from social justice.

 Yours faithfully,

Smita Gupta, Calcutta

 Ungodly mess

 Sir ? The plight of the heads of the Kanchi math brings to mind the words the bard of Avon put in the mouth of Cardinal Wolsey ? ?Had I but served my God with half the zeal/ I served my King, He would not in mine age/ Have left me naked to mine enemies.? Had Jayendra Saraswati confined himself to spiritual matters, he would have been spared his present troubles. Let this be a warning to others in ochre robes.

 Yours faithfully,

C.V. Krishnamoorthy, Calcutta

 Sir ? Did J. Jayalalithaa transfer the Tamil Nadu police chief and home commissioner after Jayendra Saraswati was granted bail by the Supreme Court because they failed to ensure that the acharya was kept in prison forever (?CM shunts officials?, Jan 13)? Whether the new incumbents fulfil her expectations has to be seen. At the risk of incurring the courts? wrath for presuming to criticize them, it needs to be said that the Madras high court?s failure to make the points that the apex court did in granting bail to the seer, is disturbing. The judiciary should not allow its image to be sullied by politicians. Further, it is ridiculous that state government should expect the apex court to banish the seer from south India. Jayalalithaa must know that Saraswati?s sympathizers are not limited by geography. They can be found all over the world and his direct or indirect influence on witnesses cannot be avoided.

 Yours faithfully,

Balram Misra, New Delhi

 Sir ? J. Jayalalithaa?s confidence in her state police department?s handling of the Kanchi math cases ? evident from her letter to the prime minister ? is misplaced. In the not unlikely event of the courts eventually exonerating the acharyas, she may well be charged with incompetence, if not vindictiveness. Will she then resign?

 Yours faithfully,

Kangayam R. Rangaswamy, Madison, US

 Sir ? Some private news channels have telecast video-clippings of the police?s interrogation of Jayendra Saraswati in a bid to increase their TRP ratings. But airing only excerpts, instead of the full tape, is sensationalism and may even be interpreted as trying to affect the outcome of the trial. An inquiry should be made into how the recording reached the media and officials guilty of the lapse punished.

 Yours faithfully,

Subhash Chandra Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir ? That Jayendra Saraswati spent two months in jail without seeking the hospitality of a five-star hospital, as other bigwigs would have managed, is quite amazing. The principle of presuming one innocent till convicted by the last court has one major deficiency, at least in public life. What if one is proved guilty at last? Would it not be better to relinquish office during the years of trials? 

 Yours faithfully,

Raghubir Singh, Pune

 Sir ? The Supreme Court?s granting of bail to Jayendra Saraswati in the Shankar Raman murder case shows the failure of the prosecution to present its case well. And the timing and manner of Vijayendra Saraswati?s arrest point to the Tamil Nadu police?s ?desperation? and ?prejudiced attitude?. Only a few days ago, the police had said that ?no further questions need to be asked Vijayendra?. So what was the need to arrest him? Also, was it absolutely necessary to arrest him when he was performing evening puja? Did he too, like his guru, have a ?helicopter ready? to ?flee to Nepal?? Though it is true that the Chandramoulishwara and Trikala pujas have been performed in the absence of the two acharyas, the manner in which action is being taken against those with any ?connection? with the math does not augur well for J. Jayalalithaa and her government. With both pontiffs out of the math and most of the top management behind bars, there are chances of a power struggle which would give the Tamil Nadu government an opportunity to appoint a receiver and take over the math, whose financial dealings run into several thousand crores. Given amma?s high-handedness, Sushma Swaraj was right to say that ?the law is taking Jayalalithaa?s course [instead of taking its own course]?. 

 Yours faithfully,

Srinivasan Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur

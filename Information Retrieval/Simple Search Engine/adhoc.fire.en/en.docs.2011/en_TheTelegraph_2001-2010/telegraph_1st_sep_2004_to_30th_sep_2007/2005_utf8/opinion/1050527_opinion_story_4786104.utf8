 Evil in a black dress

 THE BLACK ANGEL 

 By John Connolly, 

 Hodder and Stoughton, ? 10.99

 The twin demons, Ashmael and Immael, have set up shop just around the corner, here on earth. And the minions of darkness are abroad.

 Insidious forces have spirited away an innocent, young woman from the gray, soulless streets of New York. They think nobody will care. Nobody will come looking for her. They are wrong. She is ?blood? to the dreaded slayer known only as Louis ? the enforcer who stands at the right hand of Charlie Parker, private detective. And Louis will not relent till he finds her, crushing anyone or anything that stands in his way. As the gory search ensues, it dawns on Parker that this disappearance is part of an older mystery ? a mystery linked to a ?Church of bones? in Eastern Europe; to a bloody massacre in a French monastery in 1944; and to that mythical prize, sought by evil men down the ages, the Black Angel itself ? the physical essence of the twin demons. When the pace quickens and the body count rises, Parker and Louis realize that men are not the only creatures who seek that Unholy Grail ? the Black Angel.

 John Connolly wields a masterful pen, combining realism and lyricism. He adroitly pulls off the marriage of Gothic horror and hard-boiled detective fiction. The narrative is at once lucid and visceral, and at times, almost poetic. In the prologue, the author evokes the Fallen Angel thus, ?...And so, as the heavens closed above him, it was given to him to witness the face of God disappear among gray clouds, and the beauty and sorrow of the image was imprinted forever in his memory, and upon his sight. He was cursed to walk forever as an outcast, shunned even by his own kind, for what could be more agonizing for them than to see, each time they looked in his eyes, the ghost of God flickering in the blackness of his pupils??

 Connolly is an award-winning British thriller-writer with an enviable clutch of bestsellers under his belt. And The Black Angel may well prove to be the latest in that line. The novel explores the symbolism and significance of Satan in the collective human psyche, as embodied in the twin demons created by the tearing asunder of the original Fallen Angel. On one level, The Black Angel is a straightforward suspense-thriller spiked with elements of Gothic horror; on another, more allegorical level, it probes the very nature of evil. As Connolly tells it, the demonic may well have its genesis in the all-too Human. Hell, perhaps, has no geographical bearings, no physical dimensions. For centuries it has dwelt in the fetid recesses of the corrupted human mind, spawning unimaginable evils; countless fallen angels consumed by hatred and filled with vicious intent. As you close the novel, you wonder whether Satan has not been created in the baser image of humanity itself.

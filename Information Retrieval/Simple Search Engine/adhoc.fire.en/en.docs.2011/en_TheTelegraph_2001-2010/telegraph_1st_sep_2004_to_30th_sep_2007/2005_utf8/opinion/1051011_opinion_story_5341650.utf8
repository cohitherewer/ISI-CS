 BAD DREAMS IN AIR

Malvika Singh

 Most often air travel in India is like living through a bad dream, but these days it has become an unending nightmare. From the moment you turn into Delhi airport, when a chaotic maze of cars struggles to reach the entrance doors of the building because the cars have been made to twist and turn through a strange obstacle called a police checkpoint, to being airborne, it is harassment for the soul. The scene at the checkpoint ? fat, obscene-bellied cops are sprawled out, legs spread, on plastic armchairs picking their noses or scratching themselves. No car is being checked. It is just an asinine obstacle to make the cops feel important, a symbol of Incredible India. They only jump when there is a car approaching with a light on its head. Put the leaders through this trauma and things will change radically. We are truly incredible because nowhere in the world do you get this mind-boggling, feudal experience for free. 

 You alight from your car into a mad melee with endless ?push and shove? to make it to the X-ray machine where the staff are chatting animatedly to one another, least concerned about the passengers. Onto the check-in counter ? three girlies in skirts were gossiping amongst themselves as harried ?clients? looked on waiting for the queue to move. Other counters had similar ?girls? but with display boards saying ?closed?. They were least concerned with either being efficient or correct. The private airline we were getting onto had finally been coopted into becoming like the Indian Public Sector, inefficient, invaded by that special local virus called incompetence. At the departure lounge we were told that the flight was delayed because the management had to find a new cockpit crew to replace the one assigned because of the delayed incoming aircraft. Who cares? That?s their problem not ours. We have paid many thousands to travel. The meal on board was inedible. ?Oberoi flight kitchen? said the label. It looked and tasted like the leftovers from the hotel. The seats were unsittable. It will be back to Indian Airlines, that has perked up since competition hit the skies. 

 Right passport

 The departure lounge at Mumbai was spanking new but once again much too small for the increasing traffic. Soon it will become an impossible space. Airports have to be upgraded and fast. To stop the rampant money-making in the ?construction? of new buildings et al, the ministry should create hangars effectively appointed, simple, modern and functional, instead of stinking, badly-constructed CPWD buildings. Those are architectural eyesores that make India appear stuck in a warp culture which it is not. It does not take long to put these simple things in place, CPI(M) notwithstanding. 

 Cut to Sonia Gandhi?s speech in Chandigarh where she addressed her chief ministers. Her veiled reprimand was severe. Will her CMs even attempt to compel their administrations to be ?consumer friendly?? Will they make their administrators accountable to the people? How will this be brought into play and monitored? How will citizens? complaints be dealt with and civility restored? What is the methodology? As citizens we know that the administrations across India run amuck and neither care nor are accountable to anyone. 

 Sonia Gandhi even mentioned how torturous it is to get a passport, something that is a fundamental right. However, in the last year the fresh rules that have been initiated are frustratingly mindless and allow for quick cash activities. The public is forced to be subservient to these dreadful authorities, to cringe in their presence lest they deny them their right. That is the irony of life in India. Ms Gandhi should make her home minister, Shivraj Patil, set the new standard and procedure for passport delivery in 48 hours after the application is filed. That will be a small but salutary example.

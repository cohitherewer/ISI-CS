 GIFTING THE FUTURE AWAY

Twenty-Twenty / Bharat Bhushan

 Under a cloud

 When the Indian foreign secretary, 

 Shyam Saran, goes to Washington this week, will he go bearing 

 a Christmas gift for President George Bush a detailed 

 blueprint for the separation of Indias civilian and 

 military nuclear plants and facilities? The United States 

 of America would certainly be hoping that he does that.

 The signals from the US are that 

 it wants India?s nuclear plants and facilities to fall neatly 

 into one of the two categories ? civilian or military. The 

 argument is that only a clear categorization would allow 

 the US to fend off criticism that by contributing to India?s 

 civilian nuclear programme, it was aiding its military programme.

 The US has also decided, through a joint statement issued in Washington on July 18 that India would be treated in a special category ? distinct from the members of the nuclear club as well as those who have nuclear weapons, have not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, but do not merit nuclear technology co-operation. This is either because of their record of proliferation (Pakistan) or because they do not publicly claim that they have nuclear weapons (Israel).

 India?s case is, therefore, unique. The only issue left now is to implement the identification and separation of India?s civilian and military nuclear programmes. It would be up to India to declare which of its nuclear plants are civilian and which military. The July 18 agreement carries a clear provision that the separation, and the action to put the civilian nuclear programme under the International Atomic Energy Agency?s safeguards would be done in a phased manner.

 Now unless an understanding has been reached with the US behind the scenes (which seems unlikely) on a time frame and phases of the separation process, it seems that Washington is altering the meaning of the July 18 agreement to suit itself and the US congress.

 Implementing the separation in phases certainly did not mean that a decision had to be taken between July 2005 and the visit of President George Bush in early 2006. The Bush visit has nothing to do with the agreement. He and the prime minister can certainly review the progress made, but forcing India?s hand beyond that is purely political. Bush wants to show success with India.

 Once India provides the US a complete blueprint for the separation of its civilian and nuclear facilities to be implemented in phases, the US can begin asking several uncomfortable questions: Why are some facilities being put under international safeguards but not others? Are they linked to India?s strategic programme? Suppose the US then agrees to the phased implementation, the pressure would be to bring the facilities left out in the first phase into the safeguards regime quickly. In effect, India would lose flexibility.

 The provision for phased decision making, therefore, has to be understood to mean that such a deliberate process would recognize: One, India?s present and future needs for its strategic programme; two, the time and funds required to build alternative nuclear facilities earmarked for strategic purposes; and three, preventing international interference with experimental reactors, particularly the Fast Breeder Reactor, geared essentially towards India?s energy security.

 The issue of the experimental FBR also involves intellectual property rights. India is believed to be far in advance of most other countries in this area. Therefore, there is concern that putting experimental reactors under international scrutiny could seriously jeopardize India?s intel- lectual property rights over a technology of the future.

 In an experimental stage, research is pursued in several different directions in an attempt to develop a particular technology. When the entire R amp;D facility comes under international inspection, the various paths being pursued are likely to become public.

 There is discomfort in the government, therefore, on the fast breeder reactor issue. It is at an experimental stage and is the lynchpin of India?s energy security. When the FBR becomes a proven technology, at that point, India can offer to put it under safeguards. By that time, India may also have adequate stocks of plutonium for its strategic needs.

 There is, therefore, a case for a third category of nuclear facilities apart from the civilian and military programmes ? proprietary experimental nuclear facilities.

 Of course, the US will not agree to this readily. FBRs produce plutonium which can also be used for making bombs. However, given India?s limited uranium resources, the FBR is the only route for processing the spent fuel from the existing uranium-based pressurized heavy water reactors to generate plutonium which can then be used as fuel in a new generation of reactors. Even those countries which have plenty of uranium deposits are also pursuing this route, so why shouldn?t India which is short of uranium?

 The truth is that the separation of civilian and military programmes has precious little to do with international cooperation for India?s civilian nuclear energy programme in the context of the argument being made that it will aid the strategic programme. There is no evidence on the ground that international cooperation in India?s civilian nuclear programme has in any way aided its military programme. There has been no complaint of diversion of nuclear material from any of the internationally-aided nuclear plants which are all under international safeguards.

 There has been no complaint about the Tarapur atomic power plant or about the nuclear power plants in Rajasthan or in Kalpakkam where the international involvement is minimal but yet India offered to put them under safeguards. No fears have been expressed about the Russian-aided Kudankulam nuclear power plant which will go on line in 2007-2008.

 So why then is the US predicating civilian nuclear cooperation on the separation? Because it does not want India to have an autonomous civilian nuclear programme which can produce fissile material for strategic purposes. All the nuclear plants built in India with international help are light water reactors ? they do not produce plutonium. Plutonium, also used for making weapons, is produced by the indigenously developed pressurized heavy water reactors and FBRs. So both these categories are being targeted.

 This is also the reason why the proposed separation includes not only nuclear plants but also nuclear ?facilities? ? essentially meaning R amp;D institutions which may not be dealing exclusively with strategic programmes but a part of them might be. They would like to cut-off any such research links with the military programme also.

 There is yet another emerging area of concern for India. It is becoming increasingly clear that whatever separation proposals India submits to the US state department, they are likely to be shared with the US congress. Addressing a group of Indian policymakers and businessmen on December 6, the US senate foreign relations committee chairman, Richard Lugar, said, ?Let me emphasize that any Indian plan [for separation] will have to pass muster with the United States congress. This should not be viewed as a threat, but rather as a political challenge that must be met.? Congressman Henry J. Hyde, chairman of the US house committee on International relations, has also made statements which point to his ensuring that the committee is fully informed. Whether this is a threat or not is not the issue ? the point is that the Indian plan is likely to become public knowledge through the US congress. Can this be acceptable to New Delhi?

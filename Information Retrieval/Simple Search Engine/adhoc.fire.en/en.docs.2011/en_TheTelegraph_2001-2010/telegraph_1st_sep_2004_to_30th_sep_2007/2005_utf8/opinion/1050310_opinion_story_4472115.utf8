 TAKING ON SYRIA

 It was rose in Georgia, orange in Ukraine, purple in Iraq ? and now it?s cedar in Lebanon. This is how Mr George W. Bush has been counting his revolutions. He missed out Afghanistan. But that one, together with the purple and the cedar, is part of the great ?momentum of freedom? which America got going after the twin towers fell. And all for the sake of democracy. (Does the Iraqi purple stand, then, for the colour of blood?) ?That trumpet never calls retreat,? Mr Bush has declared, and the flourish is surely not just rhetorical. So it is imperative now for Syria to pull out of Lebanon, completely, as part of what the American president has described as a ?movement of conscience?. But will it be easy? 

 Lebanon is a complicatedly divided polity and society. The assassination of the former president, Rafik Hariri, in February did lead to the overthrow of the pro-Syrian prime minister, Mr Omar Karami. And this was a peaceful coup, largely brought about by Maronite Christians, Sunni Muslims and Druze. But on March 8, a visibly more populous counter-revolution was intimated in Beirut, in support of the Syrian regime and its president, Mr Emile Lahoud. The demonstrators came from all over Lebanon, and were mostly the poorer Shia Muslims who make up 40 per cent of the Lebanese population. Their main inspiration was the Hizbullah, the anti-Israel political party as well as guerrilla organization supported by Syria and Iran. To these demonstrators, who must also be counted among the Lebanese, resisting ?foreign intervention? means fighting American, British and European interference. Syria, to them, is much less foreign. Saudi Arabia would agree, as would Palestine ? all important neighbours. Remarkable too is the fact that America and France are united now in their concern for Lebanon, forcing other European Union members to take a stand. If this stand is for democracy in west Asia, would that not automatically mean aligning themselves with Mr Bush? He, in turn, has assured them that isolation through sanctions, rather than the ?purple? way, would be America?s punishment for Syria if it failed to pull out without ?delays and half-measures?. So, what Mr Tony Blair calls, more gently, a ?ripple of change? affects relations between Syria and Lebanon, as well as those between America and Europe. But democracy remains a free for all.

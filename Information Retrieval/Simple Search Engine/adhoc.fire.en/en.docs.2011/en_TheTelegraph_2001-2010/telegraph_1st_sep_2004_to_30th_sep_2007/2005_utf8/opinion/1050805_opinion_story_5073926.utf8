 Book Briefs

 Quivering shadows of the real self

 A bunch of old letters Selected and edited by Jawaharlal Nehru, 

 Penguin, Rs 750

 This is an Indian epistolary classic, first published in 1958, and now reprinted with a solid introduction by Sunil Khilnani. In April 1958, Nehru felt ?tired and stale? because as a prime minister he got ?little time for quiet thinking?. So he retired to Manali for a holiday with his daughter, and took with him several bundles of ?old letters? and plenty of books. In between reading and annotating Gunnar Myrdal, Nehru sorted these letters chronologically, prepared explanatory notes, and what emerged was not only a personal history, but a complex history of the Indian freedom movement from a uniquely human perspective. Apart from the Mahatma, Nehru?s correspondents include his father, Sarojini Naidu, Subhas Bose, Tagore, C.F. Andrews, Bertrand Russell, Edward Thompson, Amrita Sher Gil, Lady Astor, Mao Tse-tung, Stafford Cripps, Roosevelt and George Bernard Shaw. Nehru had once written to Indira that letters were the ?quivering shadows of the real self...a strange and revealing amalgam of the two ? the one who writes and the one who receives.?

 Lucidity and faithfulness

 Earthly connections By Shyamal Dutta, 

 Sahitya-O-Sanskriti, Rs 100

 The main purpose of this collection of translations, according to the translator, ?is to introduce some of the leading short story writers of Bengal?. The Old Masters in this selection are Tarasankar (?Tarini Majhi?), Bibhuti Bhushan (?Puin Machan?) and Ashapurna Devi (?Dushcharitra?), followed by Syed Mujtaba Ali, Ramapada Chowdhury, Gajendra Kumar Mitra, Buddhadev Guha and Atin Bandyopadhyay, who provides the title of the volume with his story, ?Ehalok?. ?As for my diction,? writes Dutta, ?I have attempted...lucidity of language and faithful representation of the stories.? This is from Ramapada Chowdhury?s ?Pride?: ?But after hearing what Aruna had said, my mind was filled with sorrow. The entire fascination vanished in a split-second. These days Aruna?s such type of utterances I don?t like at all.? From Gajendra Kumar Mitra: ?Where there is no trust, no love, there was no hope or any happiness, then why should she remain confined to this cage? She knew she will have no want of money and material for sexual enjoyment in this big world ? she had to only go down.?

 Inevitably eclectic

 Bookless in Baghdad and other writings about reading

 By Shashi Tharoor,

 Penguin, Rs 325

 This collection of short literary pieces is quite obviously enamoured of its own eclecticism. ?Over the years,? writes this under-secretary-general of the UN and novelist, ?I have found myself expressing opinions on a host of subjects, in the op-ed pages of an assortment of newspapers around the world...My pieces have ranged eclectically from cricket to politics and from Indian history to the challenges facing the United Nations. And many of them, inevitably, have dealt with matters literary.? The sections are headed, resoundingly, ?Inspirations?, ?Reconsiderations?, ?The Literary Life?, ?Appropriations? and ?Interrogations?. One title is ?The Pornography of Poverty?.

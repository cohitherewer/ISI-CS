 TO LIVE IN OTHER SPACES 

 MALVIKA SINGH

 It was good news when the government in Delhi announced that it would amend the masterplan and allow for working and living in the same areas. The sterile approach to the use of space as ?commercial? and ?residential? is alien to Indian civilization. It is a Western import, an uncomfortable one. Traditionally, you had your shop on the lower floor leading onto the street, and you lived on the upper floor. There was security around the clock, family members could assist in the business, and there was no problem of standing in endless bus queues or spending hours in traffic snarls. Life was dignified, time was not misspent in unproductive activities, and stress was less than it is today.

 Colonies had all the services they needed in the vicinity and as a result, there was a strong protective community feeling. When our planners superimposed frigid city patterns in urban India, we were forcibly isolated from the collective spirit and compelled into an indifferent environment with no real care or concern for one another. Alien intrusions created a fear of the unknown, as people went into their shells, boxed themselves into their own little lives, cared only for themselves. That destroyed the sense of togetherness, of community, reducing civil society to a state of chaos. Selfishness became supreme, living became isolated. The various arms of the administration joined hands with the ?intruders?, they condoned the breaking of the law, the degradation of values, forcing corruption at all levels. Ordinary life became extraordinarily difficult ? ?each to their own? became the norm.

 Wrongly informed

 Where Gandhiji had mobilized the people of this land, brought them together as he fought the battle for freedom using non-violence as his weapon, modern, independent India modelled itself on some strange Western model and has succeeded, over the decades, in fragmenting the special spirit of traditional, creative India. Our power-hungry and greedy political class, spreading their breed of ?exploitation? over years, is now in denial as its constituents recognize that their decline has begun. 

 Respect for those in power is virtually non-existent across India and Bharat. Their desperate efforts to control the energy and vitality of an emerging India will only produce a rude confrontation where the free and lively soul, with sparkle and much purpose, will surely win out. The babus and their bosses will regret their misdemeanours. Instead of seeing the obvious writing on the wall, those who rule us remain blind to the realities around. They are the small ruling (non) ?elite? that is damming Indian enterprise. Their silly archaic ?regulations? that determine honest everyday lives, coercing citizens to be dishonest, have effected unmanageable and tedious living and have corroded the intellectual and creative liberty of spirit. India has inherent strengths and those who rule us have forcibly suppressed it. That is why we are in a state of social anarchy, a society in shambles.

 The present dispensation at the Centre seems to have no intention to seriously bring in the corrective in the administration. Having been a bureaucrat, this prime minister does not question the draconian control of the bureaucracy on our lives. He does not see the corrosion that has taken place in this ?steel frame? of yore. He does not believe the truths of how the bureaucracy has harassed those who expose and fight the wrongs meted out by government. He does not see that personal vendettas are being conducted on those who oppose government wrong doings. Is that why the bureaucracy is running scared of the Right to Information Act? 

 Under a PM, seen to be upright and honest, his bureaucracy should be confident and open to scrutiny. Enough is enough, surely.

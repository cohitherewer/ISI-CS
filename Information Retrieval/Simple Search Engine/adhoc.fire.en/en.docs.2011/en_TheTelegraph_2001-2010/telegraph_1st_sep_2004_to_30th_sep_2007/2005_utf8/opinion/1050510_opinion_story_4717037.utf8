 DUE CREDIT

 The Reserve Bank of India has produced new guidelines for the corporate debt restructuring scheme and a vision document on financial sector technology at the same time. The first represents reforms, and the second is more a wish list. While the point that the RBI is not autonomous and monetary policy is still linked to fiscal policy is valid, the central bank has been pushing banking sector reforms when it can. Earlier, the threshold for the CDR scheme was an outstanding exposure of Rs 20 crore and more. Now the bar is lower at an outstanding bank and financial institution exposure of Rs 10 crore or more. Earlier, 75 per cent of creditors by value needed to support a CDR. In addition, 60 per cent of creditors by number need to support a scheme now, making decision-making more equitable. However, equity is not synonymous with efficiency, so it is debatable whether this change is desirable. But there need be no such reservations about another change, providing for a collective action clause in loan agreements where there are multiple lenders. If there is need, all lenders will abide by the majority decision for restructuring an account and this will be binding on the remaining creditors. This disciplines the CDR mechanism and members of a CDR may decide that those banks which have not joined as members will not be eligible for future consortium arrangements for lending. This core group of CDR members may review reasons for classifying a borrower as a willful defaulter and restructuring will be subject to this core group?s approval. This makes restructuring more democratic. 

 Moving on to the vision document, the RBI visualizes the use of information technology for both regulation and supervision. There will be a common inter-operable web-based structure for all regulatory functions and a single centralized database for all information. Some non-critical functions may even be outsourced by the RBI. This is welcome. But is the mass of information collected by the RBI really critical for its regulatory role? That apart, the document highlights differing IT usage across new and old private sector Indian and foreign banks, on the one hand, and public sector banks, on the other. There are no clear answers about how this digital divide can be bridged. Competition is insufficient as long as unions are around.

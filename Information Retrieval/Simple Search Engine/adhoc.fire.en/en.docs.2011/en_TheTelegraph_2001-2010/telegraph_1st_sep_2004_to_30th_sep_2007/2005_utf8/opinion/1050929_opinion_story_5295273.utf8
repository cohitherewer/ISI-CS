 OWN GOAL

 West Bengal is always a step ahead of the rest of India. Today, India will suffer an industrial strike but West Bengal will have to endure a complete strike. This means that today nothing will be working in the city. It will be a wasted day. The left is spearheading the strike and it will ensure that in West Bengal, a left-dominated state, the strike is more than successful. This transformation of an industrial strike into a bandh or a general strike is only possible in West Bengal, which has an unenviable record so far as bandhs, strikes and lost man-days are concerned. It will keep up to its past performance this time round as well. The question that will continue to bewilder all those who are voluntary participants in Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s dream of a new and vibrant West Bengal is the reason for making an industrial strike into a total bandh. If there exist few convincing grounds for the industrial strike, there are none for bringing all activities to a grinding halt in West Bengal. In other parts of India, industry will be affected ? in most states it will not be affected at all ? but other spheres of everyday life will continue unhindered. West Bengal will set a bad example and further tarnish its image as a state that shirks work and loves strikes.

 Strikes imposed on West Bengal only complicate the task Mr Bhattacharjee has set for himself. It cannot be easy for him to convince investors that West Bengal is a good investment destination when the state is laid low by strikes called by the chief minister?s own party. What will the investors take as an indicator? The good words of the chief minister or the bad deeds of his party? Investors, as is their wont, prefer deeds to words. This means that Mr Bhattacharjee will have to work twice as hard to engender faith among investors. It is not surprising that Mr Bhattacharjee has evaded all questions about the strike. It is an embarrassing moment for him but he must be aware that evasion is not a solution. Sooner or later he will have to confront the culture of bandhs and strikes in the state and take action against those who promote that culture. Today?s strike demonstrates the strong vested interest that trade unions nurture. It is the protection of this vested interest which prompts today?s strike: the Centre of Indian Trade Unions, finding itself increasingly marginalized, wants to show its muscle. The victim is the left?s most dynamic chief minister who is trying to revive West Bengal.

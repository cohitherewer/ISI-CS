 A WORKING RELATIONSHIP

 Simply criticizing the UPA government will not do, for the left has as much stake in its survival as the Congress, writes Ashis Chakrabarti

 Let?s shake hands on it

 At the end of the 18th congress of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in New Delhi last month, I asked Sitaram Yechuri what, according to him, was the left?s single-most important contribution to the way the Manmohan Singh government was functioning. ?We have been successful in changing the nature of the political discourse in the country,? he said. ?For more than six years, the communal agenda had replaced debates over basic social and economic issues. We have been able to bring these issues back to the centrestage of the political discourse.? 

 A different tune indeed from someone who had threatened that the left would ?bark? and even ?bite? if the Singh government went off the track. It was the same man who had been painted as the villain of the piece when the stock market crashed, allegedly because he wanted the new government to abolish the disinvestment ministry. 

 Obviously, the left could not have been entirely happy with the government?s ways. Even as it decided to support the United Progressive Alliance government from outside, the left made it known that it did not expect the UPA government?s economic policies to be much different from those of the Vajpayee regime. The political resolution of the CPI(M) congress accused the UPA government of being ?unwilling to change course? on the policies of liberalization and privatization. The government was also charged with adopting policies that favoured big business and international finance capital, while neglecting the interests of workers. 

 By its own admission, the left had no hope of stalling economic reforms. The CPI(M) even admits that the country needs foreign capital but wants such capital to augment the existing productive capacities of the economy and create jobs. The Congress or the Bharatiya Janata Party would have much the same things to say about foreign capital. 

 Going by what Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is doing in Bengal, it is difficult to take the left?s opposition to economic reforms seriously. It is safe to predict that in its second year, the UPA government will go faster on the reforms, including in the banking and insurance sectors, and that the left will be powerless to stall them. It will continue to make noises without being able to change anything. 

 Ironically, the left parties may not be in a position to exercise the one power they have ? to withdraw their support to the government and thereby topple it. They would then be accused of helping the BJP revive the communal agenda and make another bid to return to power. On the other hand, they have a responsibility to ensure that the government implements the common minimum programme which they had a major role in formulating. 

 The left, thus, is in a peculiar situation vis-?-vis the government. It will not do for it to merely criticize the government ? on economic reforms or other issues. It must have things to applaud the government for. Otherwise, how does it justify its support to the government? The argument that the UPA is a necessity to keep the BJP out of power is not good enough. It was easy to stay away from the celebrations that marked the UPA?s first year in office. But the left must show some achievements of the government to the people in order to justify its support to it. 

 For the left, the hope lies in the commitments made in the CMP towards the rural and social sectors. In the left?s assessment, it was the widespread rural distress that was the undoing of the National Democratic Alliance in the 2004 elections. No matter what they say in public, left leaders privately agree that economic reforms were not the Vajpayee regime?s weakest point. Instead, the withdrawal of the state from the rural sector was the cruellest thing for the masses. 

 In five years or so, rural development expenditure, which stood at 14 per cent of the gross domestic product during the eighth plan, fell sharply to around five per cent. So, while small urban islands were shining in Atal Bihari Vajpayee?s India, the vast rural landscape plunged into an ever-deepening darkness. The distress showed in repeated crop failures, falling agricultural prices and unending suicides by farmers who were unable to bear the twin burdens of the loss of their livelihood and mounting indebtedness. The helping hand of the government that they looked for in such desperate situations was increasingly missing. 

 This really is the crux of the left?s intervention in the present government, not the shadow-boxing over liberalization or privatization. The only other thing that could be as important as the government?s policies in the rural sector is the shape of the labour reforms. But the most crucial aspect of the government-left interface ? and possible tension ? would remain the rural-sector programmes. 

 Despite the groans and grunts, the left cannot have been totally unhappy with what happened in the rural sector in the government?s first year. The first budget of the government substantially increased the allocations for the agricultural sector. The government moved fast to prepare the legislation in order to meet its all-important commitment to create rural jobs through the national employment guarantee programme. In the social sector, the mid-day meals scheme for poor school students has been succe ssfully revived. But it could prove far more difficult to fulfil the CMP?s promises about land ceilings and protection of land owned by tribals and the people belonging to scheduled castes. 

 That is why the left has as much stake in the government?s performance as the Congress. When the left fights the Congress in elections in states like Bengal or Kerala, it would not be enough to accuse the UPA government of not living up to the promises in the CMP. In Bengal, the polemics over economic reforms would make little sense. The only left argument that may carry conviction will have to focus on the government?s achievements that help the common people. The left would try to project all that as the result of its intervention in the government?s policies. Elect more of us, the left would tell the people, so that we can put more pressure on the government, or it will go the NDA way. 

 But then, the people may see the achievements of the government, and its failures, as the Congress?s more than any other party?s. And, Sonia Gandhi will definitely like to see her party spread and improve its strength in the states, including the left strongholds. This would ensure that the Congress and the left would also confront each other with mutual accusations. 

 For the present, though, things seem to be working not too badly between the Congress and the left. Neither really has any choice but to do business with the other. The problems will come if an overconfident Congress starts treating Prakash Karat and his comrades like left luggage. But that is the price the left must be prepared to pay for its politics of contradictions.

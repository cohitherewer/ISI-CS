 THE UGLY FACE BENEATH THE VEIL

 Beena Sarwar

 What happened on the streets of Cairo on May 25 resonated around the world, particularly among those of us in Pakistan who saw a milder preview of the Cairo action 11 days earlier, on the streets of Lahore. Then, plainclothes police had attacked peaceful, unarmed demonstrators and sexually abused and humiliated the women by tearing their clothes. In Egypt, they went a step further ? besides beating them, some women were stripped naked, and sexually abused and groped.

 What?s going on here? In our societies, despite all the progressiveness and apparent liberalism that are emerging in the cities at least ? and, perhaps, partly as a reaction to it ? public space is shrinking for women. 

 But let?s first consider a fundamental (no pun intended) similarity between Egypt and Pakistan: each is struggling to modernize in the midst of unjust political economic and social systems, battling traditionalists and orthodoxies that incorrectly use religion to justify all kinds of injustices. The religion, of course, is Islam, to which everyone pays lip service. They?ll talk about the great respect they have for women, and how heaven lies beneath a mother?s feet, and how, on the day of judgment, you shall be identified not by your father?s name but by your mother?s? But when it comes to ground realities, it is a different matter.

 Thus far

 The ground realities are that any woman who defies the limits set for her by tradition ? not religion, mind you ? is fair game. But it?s not as simple as that. Women in our societies have already transgressed a fair number of barriers. Increasing numbers are in previously male-only or male-dominated professions ? airline (now even air force, in Pakistan at least) pilots, engineers, doctors, lawyers, scientists, dentists, politicians (even a prime minister in Pakistan).

 But it is when they engage in any public activity that has connotations for the power brokers that the might of the state is unleashed upon them. The police, who are representatives of the state, are now encouraged and empowered to resort to violence that can take on sexual connotations. 

 We?ve seen this in the days of General Zia-ul-Haq, starting with the horrific incident in 1984, when three women were stripped naked and marched through the streets of Nawabpur, near Multan, for a transgression supposedly committed by their brother-in-law. But at least the state wasn?t involved in the public humiliation, although political prisoners, including women, have long been subjected to such abuse in the ?land of the pure?.

 Fair game

 As the Egyptian activists said in a press release, ?It is the same old unethical weapon used by tyrants all over history; if you want to humiliate a nation, target...its women. If you want to oppress men, molest their women. If you want to damage a village, rape its women. If you want a prisoner to confess, threaten to rape his wife, sister or daughter!?

 On May 14 in Lahore, the representatives of the state in Pakistan attempted public humiliation for the first time when a policewoman ripped off the clothes of well-known lawyer Asma Jahangir and some of the other women participating in a token mini marathon. Their transgression: by running with men on the side-street of a main road, they tried to assert the right of women to non-segregated public space.

 There was no big deal about it ? many political demonstrations in Pakistan have been ?mixed?. So why attack this event? Because the slogan of public space and equality for women was like a red rag to the orthodox forces, which include the police ? the institution that is supposed to protect the citizenry from unlawful acts.

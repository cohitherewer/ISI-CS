 STOCK RISE

 After the dizzying pace at which the sensitive index rebounded from the lows it reached in October to hit 9000 on Monday, Tuesday?s bout of profit-taking was widely expected. But the 9000 level, although psychologically significant, is not really that important ? what matters is that the fears of rising interest rates in the United States of America have been dissipated in so short a time. In fact, the minutes of the US Federal Reserve now seem to indicate that the US central bank is approaching the end of its tightening cycle, and this has led to another surge in fund flows to equity markets. Lower oil prices have also helped. Foreign institutional sellers, who were net sellers in October, have become net buyers this month, and that has made all the difference.

 But while there is no doubt that the India story looms large in the minds of foreign investors, it is only a part of the global surge of liquidity that has lifted asset prices globally. This is clear from the fact that it is not only the Sensex that has gone up in recent weeks ? the Nikkei reached a five-year high, the South Korean Kospi has been notching up new records, and the Morgan Stanley Capital International Asia-Pacific index on Monday closed at its highest since July 2000. Even the S amp;P 500 reached a four-year high recently. In short, equities across the world are rallying, and the rise in the Sensex is part of that trend. Also, it is worth remembering that this is the fourth time in the current rally that emerging markets have recovered from a scare that rising interest rates would lead to money flowing back to the US. The first time this happened was in May 2004, just before the US Federal Reserve started raising interest rates. But the markets recovered smartly from that jolt, just as they did from similar falls in January, April and October this year. The worries stemmed from the fear that rising interest rates in the US could lead to the bursting of the housing bubble there and increase borrowing costs, thereby affecting American consumption. And since US consumption and its mirror image ? Chinese production ? are the main engines of global growth, the concern was that growth would slow down. In hindsight, on all these occasions the fears have turned out to be grossly exaggerated.

 The large number of new foreign institutional investors being registered indicates that there are still many of them who want a slice of Indian growth. But while liquidity may continue to propel the market upward, there is no doubt that valuations are very stretched at a time when corporate earnings growth is slowing down. Going forward, caution should continue to be the watchword for investors.

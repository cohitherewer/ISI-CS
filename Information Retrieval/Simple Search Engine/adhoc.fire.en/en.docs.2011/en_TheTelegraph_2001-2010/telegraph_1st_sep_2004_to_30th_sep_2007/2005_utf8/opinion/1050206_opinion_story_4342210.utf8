 DIARY

 Many are the pressures of the job and onerous the responsibilities. But thankfully, prime ministership does not seem to have robbed Manmohan Singh of his sense of humour. In the midst of all his duties, Singh found time to call up Mrinal Sen to congratulate him on getting the prestigious Dada Saheb Phalke Award. Sen thanked him and said that the one good thing the award had brought about was recognition from his wife that he was a ?great man?. The soft-spoken former professor replied that he was envious of Sen. ?My wife still does not think that I am a great man,? he said with mock grief. Perhaps, someone should give him an award too. 

 Wrestling may be a dying art in India, but with the elections in three states, akharas all over north India find themselves back in business. And the takings are quite respectable ? Rs 1,000 a day for ordinary pehelwans and Rs 5,000 for the gurus. There are ?fixed rates? for all ?poll-related duties?. Booth-capturing for Rs 5,000 a booth, and double that, at least, for any short duration kidnappings. There is a separate rate list from breaking legs, arms or for threatening. Needless to say, loyalties are subservient to whoever pays ? the Congress and its allies, on the one hand, and the NDA constituents, on the other. What a pity that such a windfall should come once in four years. 

 Arm-twisting can win elections, but it takes more subtle tactics to become chief minister. And Bhajan Lal has already lost the race to the Haryana CM?s chair, feel wags accustomed to the ways of the Congress bosses. At any rate, they can read plainly the story of the Haryana strongman?s sidelining in Sonia Gandhi?s choice of Narwana as one of her main campaign stops. Randeep Surjewala, the Congress?s candidate from Narwana, is, thus, one of the top-runners for the job. The other, they feel, is Kumari Sheilja. This is because it was on Sheilja?s say-so that the Congress president gave a ticket to Prasanni Devi, overturning her own rule not to give a ticket to anyone who had lost more than twice. So what are the odds that the Haryanvi Jats will get their first woman chief minister?

 Men in power must choose their friends with care. A few non-Bengali young bureaucrats have yet to learn this lesson. These babus are rather hip ? they dine out frequently and go to the disc, making and meeting friends regularly. At times, the mismatch between their official dowdy image and their smart social one can be quite hilarious. As happened recently. One of this merry gang was at his desk at Writers?, scribbling away, when there was a commotion outside and the bearer came in to say that a strange person, wearing earrings, his hair coloured and who called himself ?DG? wanted to see sa?ab. ?But he?s a liar. As if I don?t know what DG-sa?ab looks like,? the man protested. The official came out to see his friend, a DJ, waiting outside, surrounded by a sniggering crowd. Realizing the misunderstanding, he couldn?t apologize enough. Call it a clash of cultures. 

 ?Hansmukh? Deshmukh is back in Mantralaya, and how! Already, a section of the Maharashtra Congress is beating a track to 10 Janpath with a long list of complaints against Vilasrao. The grouses against him are, in essence, the same as they were last time. One, that he gives too much space to the NCP. And two, that he spends more time at parties and with Bollywood luminaries than he does at the secretariat or the party offices. But they knew that about him when electing him CM, didn?t they?

 Journalists in the capital are at a loose end. Now that the press club no longer serves liquor, where do they go for their sundowner, their nightly offering to Bacchus which they can?t do without? Some have been seen drinking in their cars parked outside. Obviously, desperate souls resort to desperate measures.

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has had enough of the tsunami. First, his ministers reportedly sent off cars to get Mr T. Sunami from the airport after learning that a tsunami was on its way. They even tried to explain ?plate? shifts with the help of saucers. All these may be nasty jokes, but enough to make the CM see red. 

 Merit always gets its due ? with a little help, of course. The Padma Shri for Shameem Dev Azad, a Kashmiri singer, may have been well deserved, but Congressmen are more interested in her other identity ? she is the wife of the Union urban development minister, Ghulam Nabi Azad. CWC member ML Fotedar was especially fulsome in his praise for Shameem, saying that it had taken the country twenty years to recognize her worth. Others in the party have been cattier still. They have been laying bets on which worthy spouse of a CWC member would get a national award next. Some have pointed to Shameem?s recent recital before the Congress chief at 10 Janpath. Be that as it may, Azad and Shameem, reputed to be excellent hosts, are said to be thinking of throwing a lavish wazwan repast to silence all the jealous spirits. Nothing like good food to silence the critics. But will Shameem sing before the august company?

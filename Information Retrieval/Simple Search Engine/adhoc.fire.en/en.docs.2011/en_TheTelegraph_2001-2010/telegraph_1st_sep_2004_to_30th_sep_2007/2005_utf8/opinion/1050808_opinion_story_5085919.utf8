 PAPER PLAY

 Some people never get over their first success. Ms Mamata Banerjee seems doomed to rehearse forever the drama of her first entry into parliament in 1984 as the giant-killer. Ms Banerjee had then defeated Mr Somnath Chatterjee, who is now the speaker. Drama and indiscipline, the appearance of noble impulse combined with ungovernable anger and a politics empty of theme but seething with excitability have been the hallmarks of her career. Even though throwing a fistful of documents at the speaker?s chair ? occupied then by the deputy speaker ? after a screaming tirade is perhaps a kind of acme in her career of destructive dramatics, she has had good practice in violence. Throwing a shawl at a minister or simply dragging a couple of colleagues by the collar in the Lok Sabha or even threatening a public suicide in the middle of a meeting were all part of routine. Ms Banerjee has resigned again, ignoring protocol even in the submission of her resignation, and has had her party, the Trinamool Congress, bring out its forces in her support. 

 Ms Banerjee, and therefore her party, seem to be enacting the futile thrashings-about of a force which has lost its moorings. No criticism, whether of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) or any other, can be meaningful unless it is rooted in alternative policies and techniques. Ms Banerjee once had a lot going for her. That the Trinamool Congress is still holding on to the opposition?s chair in West Bengal is an indication of the potential Ms Banerjee once had at her command. Its waning is truly unfortunate. The Trinamool Congress offers a poor alternative to the Left Front, and that is always unhealthy in a democracy. Besides, its presence as the opposition is now known only by the sudden and massive disruptions it causes. The posturing and bullying of the CPI(M) have already damaged the quality of political culture in the state, the opposition only succeeds in making it worse. By going out of her way to lose credibility, Ms Banerjee has made herself ineffective. The problem she brought up in the Lok Sabha, infiltration and swelling voter lists, is a real one. By aiming for maximum drama, in this case as in others, she has made the issue unimportant. Surely Ms Banerjee knows that grabbing attention sporadically will not smooth the way to the chief minister?s chair in West Bengal. Or maybe the knowledge is the problem.

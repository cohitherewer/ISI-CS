 Letters to Editor

 With serious reservations

 Sir ? In today?s vote-bank politics, our politicians team up to ?fight? for reservations for the lower castes, or the minorities in educational institutions, in public and private undertakings, and so on. Politicians like Ram Vilas Paswan bend over backwards to appease Muslims ? almost embarrassing them in the process. However, when it comes to reservations for women, these very politicians gang up to put all sorts of hurdles. Also, while showering their respects on B.R. Ambedkar, they conveniently forget that Ambedkar wanted caste-reservations to be time-bound.

 Yours faithfully,

 H. Parshuram, Mumbai

 Heal thyself

 Sir ? It was a flagrant violation of medical ethics by the doctor at the Murshidabad health centre to keep a critically ill child, Bidhan Mondal, unattended because it was very early in the morning. The child eventually died for want of medical intervention. It is even worse that the doctor, Gouranga Sardar, now seeks to conveniently move to a new location in order to avoid disciplinary action and social ire (?Doctor seeks shift after outcry?, June 19). 

 Such stories are common in the healthcare set-up of West Bengal. Will there ever be any justice for the countless victims of medical negligence? Like our political leaders, a health department official was quick to promise that Sardar would be ?brought to book? if found guilty. But everyone knows that there is no such thing as impartial investigation here. Section 8.5 of the ?Code of Ethics and Regulations, 2002? of the Medical Council of India mandates immediate suspension of the registration of an errant doctor when a charge of medical or ethical violation is accepted prima facie against him. And yet, neither the MCI, nor the legal or quasi-legal forums like the human rights commission have adopted any strong measures to prevent the needless loss of human lives at the hands of irresponsible doctors. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? It is possible that even if Gouranga Sardar attended to eight-year-old Bidhan Mondal as soon as the ailing child was brought to him, the child would still have died. But it is a doctor?s duty to attend to a patient, no matter how pressing his other engagements may be. I remember that years back, when I was working in Krishnapur, Murshidabad, the local government hospital was visited by more cows and dogs than patients. As a result, I had to consult a physician at his staff quarters during his outdoor duty hour at the hospital ?and of course he took fees! From the news items published in your paper, it appears that government hospitals, especially in Murshidabad, require special attention of the health department.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The news that the Medical Council Act is in for reforms is welcome. However, the reforms need to be both patient- and doctor-friendly. Right now, the activities of the council are far from transparent. The penal and ethical committee which conducts the preliminary enquiry against accused doctors does not often have specialists. How can a GP or a blood bank officer understand the intricacies of a neurosurgery? The council seeks specialist opinion in a case, but rejects it without giving reasons while arriving at the verdict. The trials are conducted most arbitrarily. The evidence collected is never presented before the accused doctors. The evidence used to reach the verdict is neither recorded nor declared, so the doctor does not know why he is being hanged. I have the personal experience of being branded ?guilty? by the council, so I have a first-hand knowledge of the loopholes that need to be plugged.

 Yours faithfully,

Anjan Kumar Banerjee, Hooghly

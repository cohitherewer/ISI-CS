 ALL SHOOK UP

 Limelight is not the best thing for everybody. The governors of two states, Goa and then Jharkhand, threw themselves into the limelight recently. The focus was not kind to them and their kind. It has simply brought to the surface a question that has been simmering for a long time, and which Mr Nitish Kumar articulated ? does the country need governors? It would seem at first sight that the larger frame of the national government, with the president and the prime minister at the head of the state and the government respectively, is reflected in the structure of each state, with its governor and chief minister. But the intellectual argument behind the governor?s presence cannot be a reflection of that behind the president?s, for there is no question here of the theoretical distinction between the state and the government. The governor?s role, apart from its ceremonial aspect, is envisaged somewhat like a class monitor?s. He reports to authority when governance in the state is not up to the mark. He dismisses governments and dissolves assemblies when he thinks legitimacy has been breached, and recommends president?s rule when there is a ?breakdown? in governance.

 A class monitor?s role is hardly a glorious one. And who, given the way the democratic system is structured, is the monitor to report to? History is rather unpleasant in this respect, as almost every political party, when in power at the Centre, has used governors as ?their men? in place. The Congress has the worst reputation for this, especially since it argues that governors, as representatives of Delhi, are the anchor when governance collapses. The logic of democracy, though, makes governors completely irrelevant. Government formation after an election can be based on certain clear-cut principles, and other institutions, such as the Election Commission, can get them implemented. Without a governor, the system can be streamlined so that other problems intrinsic to governance or its failure can be dealt with within the sphere of direct political activity. The apolitical role of the governor has long been exploded as a myth; his ?discretion? is entirely dependent on power equations among parties around him. It is perhaps an indication of the superfluity of the governor?s role that he comes into the limelight only when his actions disrupt the democratic process.

 THE FINAL STORMING

 Armageddon: The Battle for Germany 

 By Max Hastings, 

 Macmillan, pound; 14

 By late 1944, Nazi Germany was 

 locked in a final battle for survival. British and 

 American forces had reached the Franco-German border, while 

 the Red Army was preparing to launch an attack from Poland.The 

 Allieds described the impending conflict as the quot;Battle 

 for Germany quot;. 

In this book, British journalist-turned-historian, 

Max Hastings, integrates the numerous battles, fought between September 1944 and 

May 1945, into a coherent narrative of Nazi Germany?s final hours. In September 

1944, Dwight Eisenhower?s armies were stopped near the Rhine due to a fuel shortage. 

Allied commander, Bernard Montgomery, proposed that the available fuel should 

be given to the British and Canadian armies. But American general, Omar Bradley, 

demanded a share of the fuel so that general Patton could capture the Ruhr basin. 

Eisenhower, however, decided to wait for oil so that his entire army could proceed. 

During the wait, the Germans launched a vicious counter-attack. Had Eisenhower 

listened to Montgomery, wrote the noted scholar, Cornelius Ryan, then the Allieds 

would have won the war by Christmas that year.

 Hastings, however, disagrees with Ryan. He claims that Allied commanders were over cautious. Unlike Rommel, they were incapable of conducting lightning strikes. If Patton tried to advance alone, then the German armies would have attacked and encircled them. 

 Moreover, Allied generals, unlike their Russian counterparts, could not risk losing many soldiers. This was so because there was a severe shortage of manpower in the Allied forces. Between the Normandy landings and the fall of Berlin, Eisenhower?s armies suffered 460,000 casualties. The Russians suffered more than that during the campaign. 

 The Allieds were also aware that the advance into Germany would be a difficult affair. Thus, claims that Americans swept into Germany with ease are not credible, argues Hastings.

 During the final stages of the war, the Allieds committed numerous atrocities on Germans, especially on women. However, very few were punished for their crimes. Unfortunately, British historians have turned a blind eye to the tales of Allied torture, writes Hastings. And by digging up these facts, Hasting shows that many aspects of the war continue to elude modern research.

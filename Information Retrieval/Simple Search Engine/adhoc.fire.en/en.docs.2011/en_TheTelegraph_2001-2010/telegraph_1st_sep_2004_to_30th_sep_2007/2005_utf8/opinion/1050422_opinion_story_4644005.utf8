 PACKAGE DEAL

 Governments can spend money and yet end up changing little. That has generally been the story of New Delhi?s financial assistance to the North-east. It has been routine for every new government at the Centre to announce aid packages for the region. The government of Mr Manmohan Singh has done the same by announcing a Rs 900 crore package for the development of industrial infrastructure in the seven north-eastern states. It cannot be anybody?s case that the region does not need such public expenditure. Considering the economic backwardness of the region, it needs such funds possibly more than other areas. It is economically untenable to expect the region?s economy to perennially depend on tea and tourism. But some of the problems facing their economic growth are unique to these states. The three factors the government has identified for the lack of investment in the area ? the lack of security, absence of a proper infrastructure and poor market support ? are well known. The argument that faster development can help tackle the problem of insurgency in the area is also largely valid. It is not so clear, though, whether the cause-and-effect relationship between backwardness and insurgency is as certain as it is generally assumed. It is perhaps more practical to see the region?s development agenda on its own merit. 

 What is less known is the fact that the region has remained poor despite large sums of money spent for it over the decades. In fact, it is possible to cite the North-east as a case study for this typical Indian phenomenon. The creation of the small states and the battle against militancy had prompted New Delhi to spend generously in the region over the decades. If all that did little to generate economic growth, the reasons are not quite what the governments ? at the Centre or in the states ? usually offer. The most important of these is the fact that there is very little accountability on how the funds are utilized. It may not be only in the North-east that development funds are misused. What is, however, special to the region is the way the scare of insurgency is used to cover huge financial corruptions. Unscrupulous politicians and contractors often strike deals with militants to siphon off the funds. The result is the deprivations with which the people continue to live. Unless this fraud is stopped, aid packages may not change much for the North-east.

 PLAYING A ROLE IN HISTORY

THE OXFORD COMPANION TO INDIAN THEATRE, edited by 

Ananda Lal (Oxford, Rs 2,500) is an admirably comprehensive work of reference 

that sets out ? for the first time in this field of study ? the primary database 

for research on Indian theatre. Its nearly 750 entries, numerous photographs and 

extensive bibliography embrace both rural and urban modes of performance. Encompassing 

all of India geographically, its coverage goes back at least two millennia, and 

all 22 languages recognized by the Sahitya Akademi find space here. The book is 

meant for the lay reader and intends to ?provide easy availability of facts and 

analysis in a user-friendly format?. It seeks to undo ?centuries of privileging 

literature over performance, of social prejudice against performers, and of the 

consequent bypassing of theatre in the educational system.?

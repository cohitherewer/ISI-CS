 THIN LINE

 Activism in the wrong direction can turn a system upside down. The governor of Jharkhand, Mr Syed Sibtey Razi, showed frenetic activism in inviting Mr Shibu Soren to form the government in the state. Even the complications arising from touch-and-go results between coalitions ? as was the situation with the National Democratic Alliance and the United Progressive Alliance when the assembly election results were declared ? could not be used as pretext for this blatant arbitrariness. Certain principles are meant to guide the governor?s decision. Mr Razi?s action was the manifestation of a rotting political culture, in which two contending sides claim equal numbers with one legislator common to both. It is this decline of political culture, the abandonment of all appearance of good faith, the abdication of responsibility for meaningful governance, that prompted the stepping in of the Supreme Court into a realm that is not its own.

 It is almost as if Mr Razi?s action has conjured into being an imaginary governor, who is endowed with far greater powers than the governor himself. Notification for convening the assembly and deciding the date of the floor test are functions purely in the governor?s domain. The Supreme Court?s order includes these as well as other measures to ensure a fair floor test. Yet the floor test and subsequent procedures in the assembly would in any case have ultimately determined the rightful government. Reportedly, the pro tem speaker has been asked to relate to the court ? instead of the governor ? the results of the test. But there are procedures built into the governance model on which the democracy is constructed, which allow the Centre to intervene if there is a lack of confidence in a governor?s or a speaker?s actions. Goa is a case in point. The Constitution distinguishes among the functions of the legislature, the executive and the judiciary for the proper running of the democracy. An appropriation of powers of one by another is a sure way of upsetting the delicate balance, and, unchecked, would create precedents for further upsets. A procedural mess in the executive or legislature will have to be worked out within its own bounds; there is adequate provision for that. The judiciary cannot be put in the place of governor or arbiter of the assembly.

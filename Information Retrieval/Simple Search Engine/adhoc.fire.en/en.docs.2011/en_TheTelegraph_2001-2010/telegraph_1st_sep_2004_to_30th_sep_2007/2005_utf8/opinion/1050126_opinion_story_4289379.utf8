 A STEEP CLIMB AHEAD

 Vivek Chhetri

 The maverick Gorkha leader, Subash Ghisingh, continues to hold out against the state government, prompting it to adopt a soft approach towards him. But this might set a dangerous precedent, and if it goes unchecked, it may not only stifle democracy in the region but also undermine the hill council which the state government flaunts as a model development agency. 

 Ghisingh?s attempt to bargain for more control by raising the bogey of Gorkhaland comes prior to the Darjeeling Gorkhaland Hill Council elections. As always, the state government has succumbed to Ghisingh?s demand. For now, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has refused to announce the election date till the tri-partite review meeting between the Centre, state and Ghisingh takes place on January 28. The Gorkha National Liberation Front obviously smells victory in Bhattacharjee?s remark since there are now chances that elections may not be held on February 18, once contemplated by the state government.

 One more time

 This is not the first time that Ghisingh is shying away from elections. During the 1999 DGHC elections, he forced the state government to defer the polls by three months, arguing that hill people migrate to the plains during winter. Ghisingh has boycotted two general elections since coming to power in 1988. When the third term of the DGHC came to an end on March 26, 2004, Ghisingh bargained with Bhattacharjee for an extension to run the council. The state government agreed to an eight-month extension till November 30, 2004, citing the Lok Sabha elections. But Ghisingh managed to postpone elections even further. And now that the elections are near, Ghisingh has told his supporters that there would be no polls unless ?an alternative to the council is worked out?. 

 Ghisingh obviously believes that he can get away with anything. And the state government must be held responsible for boosting that belief. His demands would have been justified had democracy prevailed in the hills for the past 16 years that he has been in control. But no. Ghisingh?s style of functioning can at best be described as autocratic. For a leader who catapulted to fame riding piggyback on his people?s aspiration, the decision to stay aloof from the grassroots is unacceptable. He neither has time for his people, nor his party leaders.

 Sticky wicket

 Within the DGHC, the finances are already under his control and officials require the chairman?s sanction even to purchase office commodities. Development work is carried out depending on the whims and fancies of the chairman. Not unnaturally, Darjeeling continues to suffer from a severe water crisis. 

 The state government has publicly accused Ghisingh of failing to account for the Rs 16 crore given to the DGHC to solve the problem. The council receives almost Rs 100 crore annually, but its expenditure has always been kept under wraps. It has not had the mandatory general council meeting for the past four years, meaning that the DGHC budget has not been tabled since then. The executive council, scheduled to meet every month, has not met for the past four years also. 

 The state government seems willing to bargain with Ghisingh although the last council elections in 1999 showed that almost 48 per cent of the hill people had voted against him. With the opposition joining hands with the left now, Ghisingh knows that he is on a sticky wicket. But with a pliant state government willing to play along, he has mustered enough courage to demand that there will be no elections. The DGHC has to answer its people and the government which doles out incentives. The failure of the government at this critical juncture will have serious ramifications for the hills.

 NO ROYAL RETURNS

 Less lucrative

 A proportion of each book?s print run is given away free to literary editors and reviewers, while another slab, having been distributed to booksellers, is returned unsold. Both returns and free inspection copies are factored into the costing of each individual title. But they also have implications for authors that are often overlooked because they don?t read the fine print. 

 Clearly, there are two aspects. First, the most obvious, both returns and frees are added on to the cost of production that increases the unit cost and therefore the price, cutting into the sales potential of a book. Second, returns make calculation of royalties tricky because no publisher can identify the exact number of copies that may be sent back. Of the two, it is the royalty factor that makes authors suspect there is a fiddle somewhere that robs them of their legitimate royalties on sales.

 Most authors accept the fact that the unit cost of review copies should be an add-on to the cost of paper, printing, binding and that the total cost should include publicity overheads. After all, they realize that publicity comes at a price and it helps them both professionally as well as financially. So, the little extra added on is not very irksome, much as they complain about high prices inhibiting larger sales. 

 It is the returns that make royalty calculations difficult. Although every publisher has a time limit, about 6 to 8 weeks from the date of despatch, after which returns are not accepted, it never seems to work out simply because monitoring returns is very tedious. 

 What happens in practice is that returns are lumped together towards the end of the financial year which requires reverse entries in the sales ledgers. This increases the clerical load and mistakes occur on the number of copies sold. Computerization of sales and returns have made calculations less erroneous but slippages do occur and the actual sales figures may be more than what is shown in the audited royalty statement. 

 In India, almost all returns are shop-soiled, or at least cannot be sold at the listed price. These books have to be ?written off? as damaged copies or sold at greatly reduced prices. From the publisher?s point of view, the author has to pick up the tab by accepting lower sales, and therefore, lesser royalties. Although authors argue that this is unfair, the system of returns leaves publishers with little choice except to get the author to share the risks.

 Publishers cannot do without returns for two reasons. First, the system is too well entren ched to be done away with. Second, publishers argue that it is far better for their books to be in a bookshop than in a warehouse where nobody sees them. In bookshops at least, there is half a chance of them getting noticed and bought. One hopes that retail trade would take better care and return the titles sent on approval in the same mint condition. But under hot, dusty and humid conditions, this is perhaps too much of an ask.

 NOT A REVENGE PLAY

 Instead of raising a people?s army, the government should concentrate on developing Chhattisgarh to tackle the Maoists, writes Tapas Chakraborty

 Fighting back

 In the bucolic paradise of Bastar in Chhattisgarh, a disintegration of the indigenous people?s psyche is taking place as dwellers have resorted to killing each other. The indigenous population has become sharply polarized into groups which either hate or are loyal to the Maoists. The Gonds, Abujmarias, Bishonhorn Marias are now armed with poisoned bows and arrows while those who have been trained in combat skills by the Maoists have police rifles and self-loading rifles. The tribals of the region who had revolted against the British twice are now involved in frequent skirmishes. The fear of a bleak future is gnawing at the hearts of the tribal populace.

 The evening silence in the thick forests of Bastar is broken by the sounds of gunfire, bomb explosions and screams of men and women. The attacks by pro and anti-Maoist groups have led to loss of lives, destroyed homes and led to a series of violent incidents between the people?s militia and the Maoist rebels.

 A section of the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party leaders in Chhattisgarh call this ?a people?s peace movement? while Maoist sympathizers among tribals, who are targets of attack by an organized people?s militia, describe it as a brutal move to suppress the people?s movement in Bastar which has been going on for the last three decades.

 Five Maoist sympathizers were recently killed when they were shot with poisoned arrows in the Bheji area of Dantewara district by tribals who are alleged supporters of Mahendra Karma, a tribal who is also the Congress opposition leader in the state assembly. In early September, 10 tribals were killed in Arial village in a fight between the Maoists and the tribals. 

 The Maoists have also begun to retaliate against the members of what they call a ?reactionary counter revolutionary movement?, and have killed a number of its leaders, including two relatives of Mahendra Karma. Karma is known for his anti-Maoist tirade for a long time. This time he launched a movement with support from the BJP and called it ?a spontaneous people?s uprising?. The movement ironically is called ?Salwa Judum? (peace march) in local tribal language.

 The war within the tribal home land began in June this year when Maoist activists began to receive information of horrific incidents of police atrocities on villagers executing their orders. In the last six months, entire villages have called upon the Maoists to lay down their arms and join the mainstream. When they refused to do so, their houses were burnt and homeless tribals put up in camps in Dantewara under strict police security. The Maoist reaction has been far from peaceful. Reprisals have led to numerous killings. The toll in both Maoist attacks and counter attacks by the people?s militia have resulted in at least 150 deaths in districts of Dantewara and Bastar in the last few months.

 The situation in Bastar, fast spiralling out of control, has drawn parallels with the strife in Somalia and Ethiopia where, in 1972 and 1976 respectively, the people?s militia was formed to carry out police duties and vigilant groups guarded grazing areas. However, whenever people?s militia have been formed to control social unrest, it has followed a well-laid-out policy. In Somalia, for instance, the people?s militia worked under the political bureau of presidency. In some countries like Ethiopia, the people?s militia was empowered by a legislation.

 In combating the red rising in states like Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Bihar, the state governments have gone for short-cuts: supplying arms surreptitiously to avoid controversy. In Bihar, the police had secretly gone on supporting the Ranveer Sena to checkmate the Naxalites. The experiment had backfired. In Jharkhand, the police are supporting and even said to be funding the self-styled people?s security groups. And now in Chhattisgarh, this has become an open secret. Local newspapers have reported that Salwa Judum activists are arresting Maoist sympathizers. If the government has supported villagers by providing arms, why did it not have the courage to spell it out and have a policy so that even these groups could be held accountable for violations of human rights? 

 What has further exposed the state government to ridicule is the lack of a political consensus. The state government?s decision to back the Mahendra Karma movement has caused a chasm in the political circuit. The factionalism within the Congress party has resurfaced over the difference of opinion between former chief minister, Ajit Jogi, and Congress opposition leader Mahendra Karma. Despite Karma publicly identifying himself with the Salwa Judum movement, Jogi has opposed it, alleging that many innocent adivasis were getting killed.

 Former Madhya Pradesh chief minister, Digvijay Singh, had announced in 1998 (Bastar was then a part of the state) that he was against even banning the Maoists. Singh was of the view that the Maoist menace was not just a law and order problem. He had stated that if the Maoists are wiped out from Bastar, whatever health and educational facilities the tribals are getting now would not reach the far-flung villages. Singh does not appear to have changed his mind now.

 Chhattisgarh chief minister, Raman Singh has managed to take some opposition leaders into confidence on this crucial issue, in a clear attempt to drive a wedge into the faction-ridden Congress. Mahendra Karma, who has always opposed Ajit Jogi, is now Singh?s weapon to keep the opposition divided. At a time when his government is also facing difficulties in delivering populist poll promises like the distribution of cows free of cost to tribal families, Singh feels that the counter-Maoist movement would divert attention from his detractors within and outside the BJP.

 The chief minister has now felt the need to deliver on real terms and has begun talking about the finalization of a ?vision plan? to be implemented from next year. In implementing these development plans, which make no specific mention of tribal development, the Raman Singh government had in mind the projects involving the state?s natural resources. The state government has signed deals worth Rs 60,000 crore recently. In Bastar, there has been talk of setting up steel plants with an investment of more than Rs 16,000 crores.The Maoists and an array of frontal organizations under them have expressed concern over the fear of displacement of tribals in the region once the mines are opened for industrial use. 

 Finding a solution to the Maoist problem involves manifold challenges. It is important first to send doctors, health workers, teachers and block development officers to the far- flung villages of the region rather than sending armed men if the government is serious about earning the trust of the indigenous people who have been feeling neglected for so many years. The state government ought to improve the literacy rate and ensure the basic needs for a civilized living to bring peace in the region. Just because deals have been signed, the state government cannot afford serious lapses on its human indicators . It would be living in a fool?s paradise in trying to change the law and order situation overnight by launching the people?s militia or sending the army. It would just end up worsening human rights violations in the state.

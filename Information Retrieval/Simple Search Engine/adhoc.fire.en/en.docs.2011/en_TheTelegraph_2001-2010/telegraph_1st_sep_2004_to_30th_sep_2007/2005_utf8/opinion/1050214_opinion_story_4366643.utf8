 PEACE IS A MIRAGE

 Gwynne Dyer

 Peace is at hand! Democracy is spreading like wildfire! I?d like to believe it, but I just can?t. No Israeli-Palestinian peace settlement is in sight. And Democracy is not sweeping the Arab world. 

 The mainstream Western media are sometimes pathetically easy to manipulate. President George W. Bush gives a couple of speeches in which he declares yet again that ?freedom is on the march? in west Asia, there are elections (of a sort) in Iraq and Saudi Arabia, Israeli and Palestinian leaders shake hands ? and suddenly the talk is all of ?windows of opportunity? and ?democratic transformation? in the region.

 Bush talks like that because it pushes all the right buttons with the only audience he really cares about, the American one, but what real evidence is there for a new dawn of peace and democracy in west Asia?

 That is a misleading question, in a way, for that area has already been at peace for over a decade. Apart from the US invasion of Iraq two years ago and occasional Israeli forays into Lebanon and Syria, no military forces have crossed international frontiers in the region since 1991. When the Western media talk about ?peace?, they really mean a permanent peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians who have lived under Israeli military occupation for the past 38 years.

 Little change

 It is generally accepted that the settlement must involve a ?two-state solution? that turns the occupied Palestinian territories into an independent Palestinian state. The three main obstacles to that settlement have always been the same: the desire of millions of Palestinian refugees to return to their former family homes in what is now Israel; the Jewish settlements that have been illegally planted all over the occupied Palestinian territories; and the Palestinian demand that East (Arab) Jerusalem be the capital of their new state. 

 None of this has changed for years, and it isn?t changing now. Yasser Arafat is dead and his elected successor, Mahmoud Abbas, wears a suit and tie, but he is still answerable to the same community ? and is still dealing with the same Israeli leader, Ariel Sharon, who hasn?t changed his spots either.

 After thousands of deaths and years of poverty and misery, most Palestinians are so exhausted that they welcome an end to the intifada, and even the militants will go along with Abbas?s ceasefire for now. They will bide their time, and wait for Palestinian frustration at the lack of real progress on a peace settlement to grow.

 Don?t get taken

 Sharon is perhaps even less delighted with the ceasefire, since it makes it harder to go on building his ?security fence?, whose unavowed purpose is to impose de facto borders on the West Bank that leave all the main areas of Jewish settlement within Israel. But the noisy and prolonged business of pulling a mere 7,500 Jewish settlers out of the Gaza Strip should give Sharon sufficient cover to finish the fence. 

 Municipal council elections in Saudi Arabia, with half the council members still appointed by the royal family and no women allowed to vote, may be a great step forward for Saudi garbage and sewage, but it?s not a very big deal for actual Arabian people. The Palestinians voted for Mahmoud Abbas in free elections last month, but then they voted freely for Yasser Arafat years ago. Iraq?s election was a genuine achievement despite the Sunni Arab boycott, but the Bush administration can hardly take credit for it. The ?Coalition Provisional Authority? tried hard to avoid or postpone an election until Shia pressure forced it to grant Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani?s demand for free elections. And God only knows what will come of them in the end. 

 In other words, Things are not worse in West Asia than they were last year. They might even be slightly better. But peace and democracy are not breaking out all over.

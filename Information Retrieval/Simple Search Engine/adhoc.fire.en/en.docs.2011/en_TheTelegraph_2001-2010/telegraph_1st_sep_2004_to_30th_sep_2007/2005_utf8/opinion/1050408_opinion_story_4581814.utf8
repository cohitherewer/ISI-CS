 Successful people, toxic people

Rewind for fast forward: A review of state level 

IEC initiatives on hiv/AIDS (Centre for Media Studies, price not mentioned) 

is a substantial publication that brings together initiatives taken in each Indian 

state by the State AIDS Control Society. ?IEC? is ?Information, Education and 

Communication?, and it is bad communication to put such a technical acronym in 

the title. Commissioned by NACO and financially supported by UNAIDS, this review 

is the first of its kind, and should be studied critically by a wide-range of 

readers, for its practical as well as sociological lessons, many of which are 

taught by the book quite unwittingly. There is very little conscious reflection 

in the report on the fact that a great deal in HIV/AIDS is about sex (and all 

kinds of sex), and therefore ?communicating? and ?educating? people, especially 

young people and women, about HIV/AIDS would mean negotiating the boundaries of 

what can be said or not said, shown or not shown publicly and lucidly. The presentation 

and analysis are dull and technical, and could have been far more critical and 

imaginative.

A spoke in the wheel (HarperCollins, Rs 395) 

by Amita Kanekar describes itself as ?a novel about the Buddha?. It acknowledges 

a vast body of purely secondary literature on Buddhism and on ancient India (Basham, 

Kosambi, Thapar and others). Kanekar?s interpretation of the Buddha?s ?enlightenment? 

is also ?completely owed? to Iqbal Singh?s Gautama Buddha. Inspiration 

is derived even from Sholay. The result is a fairly massive, plodding book 

almost entirely lacking in imagination. The monk, Upali, and the emperor, Ashoka, 

never become complex, living beings, but mouthpieces and embodiments of predigested 

?interpretations?. Very uninspiring.

 The success principles (HarperCollins, Rs 495) by Jack Canfield 

is another massive and garrulous book, full of good advice on How 

to Get from Where You Are to Where You Want to Be. Co-creator of Chicken 

Soup for the Soul, Canfield obviously does not believe in the Cheshire Cats 

hilariously profound advice about going places, although his smile 

on the cover might remind a few of that wonderfully uncaring cats famous 

grin. Canfield has built a $80 million business from nothing, and as a pithy foretaste 

of what one might find inside his book, he offers this aper ccedil;u on the back 

cover: If you keep on doing what youve always done, youll keep 

getting what youve always got. The italics are terribly important. 

There are unwittingly entertaining sections called Avoid toxic people 

and Surround yourself with successful people. It is a pity that perfectly 

respectable Indian bookshops these days are full of these odious books, and there 

must be plenty of people whose lives change after reading them. A disconcerting 

thought. 

 The vedas, hinduism, hindutva (Ebong Alap, Rs 100) by Kumkum Roy, 

Kunal Chakrabarti and Tanika Sarkar is an entertaining, unconventional, but entirely 

serious discussion, by three leading Indian historians, of Hinduism, Hindutva 

and its origins (mythical and historical), meant for the curious reader. 

How Vedic are our 

religious traditions? Is the Gita the sacred text of the Hindus? Is Hindutva synonymous 

with Hinduism? These are some of the many questions brought up as part of a serial 

effort to demystify some of the key ideas/issues that are shaping in a major 

way our lives and the world we live in.

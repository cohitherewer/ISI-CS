 Princesses don?t swoon any more

 Castles of steel: britain, germany and the winning of the great war at sea (Pimlico, ?9.99) by Robert K. Massie is a book about leadership and defeat, bravery and timidity, genius and folly. The story is driven by some of the most dramatically intriguing personalities in history: Churchill and Jacky Fisher, Jellicoe and Beatty, together with the powerful Germans ? von Pohl, Scheer, Hipper and the grand old fork-bearded genius, Tirpitz. In August, 1914, the two great navies in the world confronted each other across the North Sea. At first there were skirmishes, then battles off the coasts of England and Germany and in the far corners of the world, including the Falklands. The British attempted to force the Dardanelles with battleships ? which led to the Gallipoli catastrophe. As the stalemate on the ground on the Western Front continued, the German Navy released a last strike against the British ?ring of steel?. The result was Jutland, a titanic and brutal battle between dreadnoughts. The picture shows Lord Kitchener in the most famous of all recruiting posters. In the first 18 months of the war, one million Britons volunteered for military service.

 Interesting times in india: a short decade at St. Stephen?s college (Penguin, Rs 295) by Daniel O?Connor combines popular history and personal memoir to document the development of Indian higher education in the Sixties. O?Connor and his wife arrived in India in 1963, to live and work at St. Stephen?s College, Delhi, and left in 1972. From Narayani Gupta?s foreword: ?How vividly the 1960s come back! The great student revolution of 1968 in Europe had its counterpart in the Indian students? protest movements of 1966.? There is an afterword by Gopal Gandhi.

Unprincess! (Puffin, Rs 135) by Manjula Padmanabhan brings together three fairytale anti-heroines for young readers ? Urmila, Kavita and Sayoni ? who robustly overturn the stereotype of the swooning princess. Urmila is so ugly that she makes people pass out. Kavita can take on giants more competently than any prince and Sayoni has the power to tame even the wildest nightmare. Urmila is ?even able to frighten cellphone service providers into offering affordable plans with easy-to-understand bills.?

 Letters to Editor

 Labour concerns

 Sir ? Instead of thinking of herself as ?underpaid and overworked?, ?Anamika? should be grateful that she has access to economic gratification of a kind that her parents never had and 90 per cent of the world?s populace still don?t (?To unionise or not?, Oct 23). Second, she has to realize that the free market economy, which is moving jobs from the West into India and giving millions in our country (including herself) unprecedented financial rewards, is based on the principles of choice and non-coercion. Nothing and nobody is forcing her to stay at her current job. If she thinks what she is giving far outweighs what she is receiving in return she has the choice of leaving. If too many like her leave and are not replaceable by equally competent workers, the principles of free market will kick in and the industry will address the issues causing people to leave. You cannot, on the one hand, argue in favour of a free market to support outsourcing and then complain against it when it hurts you personally. 

 On a more personal note, as an IT professional I must say that all this talk of IT workers being overworked is hogwash. Every successful IT professional has been ?overworked? since the beginning of the computer age. I have spent the greater part of the past 25 years in front of the computer, working the keyboard. I do not yet suffer from myopia, spondylitis, carpal syndrome, stress, backache, high blood pressure, diabetes, amnesia or buzzing sound anywhere. The problem is not ?overwork? so much as a lack of purpose in life. 

 Yours faithfully,

Probal Das Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? It seems that a section of politicians and IT industrialists are trying to extract an unjustified immunity for the IT industry from trade union laws. Where were these messiahs, who think trade unions are a stumbling block to development, when giants like Metal Box and Dunlop closed shutters, depriving workers of huge statutory dues and driving them to destitution? When other industries follow the labour laws of the land, why then this orchestrated din for special treatment for IT? This does not happen even in developed countries. 

 The majority of IT companies and private banks make their employees work for 12 hours a day; some BPOs do not even extend provident fund benefits to their employees. Politicians who want to keep trade unions out of IT should not forget that these trade unions were their passport to a political career. While individuals should not be compelled to take part in trade union activities, governments must ensure that IT employees are not victimized for their voluntary participation in trade unions, leading to a repetition of the unfortunate incident in Gurgaon.

 Yours faithfully,

R. Sambamurthy, Calcutta

 Sir ? Unionizing per se is fine, but to be at the behest of retrograde leaders is not. The IT sector, where continuity of work is so important, cannot be exposed to self-serving and irresponsible union leaders. At the same time, IT workers also need a forum ? a small group of the most eloquent among them, perhaps ? to highlight problems of the kind that beset Anamika . The perception of being exploited is not really one of long work hours or wages not commensurate with them. Any further rise in the wages of IT workers will only deprive India of the cost advantage it has in attracting the ITES/BPO business worldwide. The companies involved in the sector do have respectable human resource practices, but the people who man them also need to be sensitive to the work-area needs of the employees. Managements must resolve these issues not only to counter attrition but also to ensure that the system does not fall prey to unions. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sujoy Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is indeed funny that the issue of strikes in ?continuous process industry like IT? dominated the agenda at the CPI(M) politburo meeting (?Strike-free IT in Buddha reach?, Oct 24). Deng Xiaoping must be turning in his grave. Why just IT, the blast furnaces, converters and coke ovens in steel plants, as well as the heat exchangers, boilers and process equipment in chemical plants are all 24x7 industries, where abrupt shutdowns cause severe damage to equipment resulting in losses worth crores of rupees and the consequent flight of investors from the state. Is it that West Bengal intends to care only for the IT sector, having lost the race for steel plants to neighbouring Orissa? 

 Yours faithfully,

Gautam Mookerjee, Pune

 Sir ? It is heartening to note that Jyoti Basu has, at long last, realized the ill-effects of bandhs, gheraos, and strikes which were the order of the day during his tenure. Had Basu woken up to the ground reality two decades ago and concentrated on development of West Bengal, as Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is now doing, the state?s economy would have boomed. However, he should now rally round Bhattacharjee along with senior politburo members, so that investments can come in and development take place swiftly. 

 Yours faithfully, 

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 Errata

 Sir ? The article, ?The truth about Iran? (Oct 25) contains a significant inaccuracy. Iran, unlike many other countries, was not formally colonized. But its 20th century history was marked by the anxiety to keep foreign powers at bay ? an attempt that formally broke down during World War II. The point the article was making is that the moral psychology this history has produced needs to be understood. I deeply apologize to readers of The Telegraph for the inaccurate suggestion that Iran had been colonized in the conventional sense.

 Yours faithfully,

 Pratap Bhanu Mehta, Gurgaon

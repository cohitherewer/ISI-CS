 REDRESSED

 Drawing a straight line is a difficult task for most people. There are fumbles, trembles, nicks and joints. It is even more difficult when the line is imaginary, to be drawn to separate the different rights attendant upon the desire for a full human existence: the right to respect as a human being with freedom of choice, the right to claim one?s religion, the right to identity, the right to education, the right to dress as one wishes, the right to run an institution with minimum conflict, the right to think. No straight line can separate them. It is the ongoing contest and the ever-changing dynamics of reconciliation among these that the British schoolgirl, Ms Shabina Begum, has brought to light by her long legal battle against her school. She has won it at last, through a remarkable judgment that has granted her the right to wear a jilbab to a school which does not include it in its multiracial uniforms.

 Ms Begum?s lawyer, who is also the wife of the British prime minister, built the case on the ?fundamental issues? about the nature and interpretation of her client?s rights to education and freedom to practise her religion. In other words, what could be phrased as ?overtly? religious ? the basis on which France banned headscarves in schools ? could be rephrased as the basic questions of a secular state and law. A declared religious identity, especially when non-Christian, in schools in the West was assimilated into the discourse around fundamentalism and faith after 9/11. For a resolution, the confusions within the concept of secularism, initially a struggle between the church and the state, have now to be tested against the touchstone of aspiring multireligious societies. The problems of the schools, worried about competitive virtue among its believing students, as Ms Begum?s school has submitted, may be genuine. But the question is, how serious are they among the issues raised? The new way, as indicated by Ms Begum?s case, could be to rethink boundaries. For Ms Begum, her triumph is a victory for all Muslims ?who wish to preserve their identity and values despite prejudice and bigotry?. The question is of choosing to preserve identity and values and having the right to do so. The faith or non-faith, the ethnicity or race or gender, does not matter.

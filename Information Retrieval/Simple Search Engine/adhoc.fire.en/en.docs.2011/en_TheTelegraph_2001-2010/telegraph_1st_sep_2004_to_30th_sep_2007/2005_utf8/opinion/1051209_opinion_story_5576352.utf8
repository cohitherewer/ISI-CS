 OTHER SUMS

 Nostalgia is a good way to inject fresh life into a relationship. The emphasis of the Indian prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, on the long and warm relationship of India and Russia, formerly the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, was the natural route into discussions about close connections in a changed and changing world. The past could be seen as a guarantor of optimism for the future. But the change in the equations of global power in a world where the structure of the economy has changed too would need altered premises of understanding even in an ambience of inherited warmth. While there was a positive response to India?s desire to increase cooperation in nuclear energy, the Russian president, Mr Vladimir Putin, was specific about the condition of India?s cooperation with the expectations of the Nuclear Suppliers Group and of the United States of America. It is important for India to expand its nuclear energy facilities, for electricity from oil, gas or coal may become increasingly difficult to acquire in the future. For the cooperation of Russia in this respect, India would need to separate its military and civilian nuclear facilities. Russia?s supply of fuel to the Kudankulam facility had stalled on the objections of other members of the NSG. This time, a partnership in this sector, perhaps going even beyond Kudankulam, could be hinted at because of the commitments India has made in the joint statement with the US in July.

 This is almost a fable of the path that the relationship between India and Russia would take in a changed world. It was important for the Indian defence minister to make clear that India?s newfound closeness with the US and its military suppliers would not lessen Russia?s presence as the dominant supplier in this sector. Militarily, Russia and India both have an interest in keeping a joint eye on China. The slow development of an Indian-American area of understanding is gradually forging greater comfort regarding Pakistan. A renewed understanding with Russia would consolidate the comfort, especially with regard to China. That Russia recently trod a fine line in the controversy over Iran?s nuclear capability indirectly helped India, both at home and abroad. With matching aims, the area of unarticulated cooperation between the two countries could be enlarged further, a development that would be enhanced by the expansion of bilateral trade that the prime minister has envisioned.

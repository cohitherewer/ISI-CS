 MAKE WAY FOR OTHERS

 Gwynne Dyer

 Assume that the people who run defense and foreign policy in the Bush administration are as ferociously intelligent as they think they are. What would their grand strategy be?

 The phrase ?grand strategy? has an antiquated ring; modern opinion rejects the notion that relations between great powers are just a zero-sum game. But this is a group of people who are steeped in traditional modes of strategic thought: Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz, Stephen Hadley and Condoleezza Rice would all have worked quite comfortably for Cardinal Richelieu or Count Bismarck. 

 They are, in addition, patriotic Americans who are convinced that US power is an instrument for good in the world. And they all know that the days of of America as the sole superpower are numbered.

 They cannot be unaware of the statistics the rest of us know. The Chinese economy has been growing over twice as fast as the US economy for almost two decades now, and the Indian economy has been growing at around twice the US rate for almost a decade already. And they surely understand the magic of compound interest. 

 One among many

 China?s economy will overtake that of the US in one long generation if current trends continue. India, starting later and growing slightly slower, will not reach the same milestone for a further decade or more, but both Asian giants will be nipping at America?s heels long before that. And economic power is the source of most other kinds of power.

 Most people are not alarmed by this because they assume that there will no longer be a Communist China 35 years from now, and they know that India is a democracy already. There is nothing in either country?s history or current behaviour to suggest that they would behave less responsibly than the existing great powers have done. But seeing the US reduced to only one great power among others cannot be a prospect that appeals to American strategic thinkers of a traditional bent ? so what is their grand strategy for averting it?

 Paramount powers facing relegation always have one, although it rarely stays the same for long and it never, ever works. In the past, we have observed other ?sole superpowers? slide down the slope of decline ? Spain, France and then Britain ? and none of them came close to solving the problem. 

 Game plan

 People who search for a long-term strategy in neo-conservative policies invariably end up thinking there is none, but that?s because they are looking for coherence.When strategists are confronted with an insoluble problem, they try to solve it anyway, and they are not above using irrational assumptions to stick the bits of rational analysis.

 How might this apply to the senior people in the Bush administration? Some of them believe exactly what they say, no matter how simplistic and delusional it may appear to outsiders, but others are genuine strategic thinkers. These people will not speak in traditional power-political terms ? instead they will use the ?terrorist threat? or any other excuse that comes to hand to justify their strategies. 

 Is the invasion of Iraq, and the whole project of resurrecting Pax Americana that lies behind it, just such an attempt to head off impending decline by putting the US back in the global driving seat? Very likely. Will it work? Don?t be silly. It never works: economics rules, and there is no way of stopping China and India from catching up with the current lone superpower short of nuking their entire economies. 

 And no: I don?t think they?d do that. But their little adventure will almost certainly have the long-term effect of hastening America?s relative decline. That sort of strategy usually does.

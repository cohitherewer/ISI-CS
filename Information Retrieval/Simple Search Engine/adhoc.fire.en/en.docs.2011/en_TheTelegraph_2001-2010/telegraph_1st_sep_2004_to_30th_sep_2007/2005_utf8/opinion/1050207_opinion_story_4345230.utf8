 THIN EDGE

 Unstable governments seem to be the fate of some states. Goa now has a new government, led by the Congress, although the ousted Bharatiya Janata Party-led government has completed just two-and-a-half years in office. The BJP was full of glee when it beat the Congress by one seat to form the government in 2002. But it was just one seat. Clouds began to gather when the United Progressive Alliance government arranged for the replacement of the governors of four states, including Mr Kidar Nath Sahani of Goa, in July 2004. Almost predictably, trouble exploded last month with the resignation of three BJP legislators. The Congress immediately produced a government-in-waiting with the former chief minister, Mr Pratapsinh Rane, at its head. The ugly tensions that erupted when the governor, Mr S.C. Jamir, asked the chief minister of the BJP-led government, Mr Manohar Parrikar, to prove his majority on the floor of the house convey the edgy, suspicious quality of politics in Goa. The Congress would rather have had the governor sack the Parrikar government straight away. 

 It got uglier. When Mr Parrikar appeared to have won the vote of confidence, that was perceived to be only on the strength of the decision of the speaker, Mr Vishwas Satarkar, to debar an Independent member of the legislative assembly from voting at the last moment. The MLA had asked for more time to give his comments on a disqualification petition filed by the BJP alleging that he had violated the anti-defection law. The speaker also counted an opposition Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party MLA as a supporter of the Parrikar government, in a bid to push up the BJP?s strength. This farce destroyed the credibility of the floor-vote and led to the governor?s invitation to the Congress to form the government. While the BJP goes to court to challenge the UPA government?s decision to replace governors, the speaker fights to retain his chair in spite of being a BJP man, and Goa teeters once again with a government which barely made it, certain questions remain unanswered. It is always at these moments of instability and change that the questions recur. What is the role of the governor? If his role as ombudsman requires him to be an appointee of the party in power at the Centre, what is his duty? Also, if a speaker shows bias, what follows? Since mayhem is really not a useful answer, it is time these issues were worked out.

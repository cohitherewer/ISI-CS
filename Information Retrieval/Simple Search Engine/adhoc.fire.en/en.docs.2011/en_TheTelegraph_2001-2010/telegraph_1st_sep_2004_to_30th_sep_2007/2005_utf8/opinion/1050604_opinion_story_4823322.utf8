 LEAGUE OF NATIONS

 Insecurity often gives rise to confused thinking and an inability to confront the inevitable. A peculiar mix of xenophobia and lack of practical sense characterizes the All India Football Federation?s decision to ban foreign players from all domestic tournaments except the National Football League. The ban, in itself, has given rise not only to confusion regarding its exact terms, but also to intense controversy. If carried through, this regulation will stop foreigners from playing in all major tournaments in the country, including the leagues in Calcutta and Goa, the Federation and Durand cups and the IFA shield. The main argument for banning these players seems to be the need to give Indian players better exposure. Foreigners are perceived, by this unabashedly provincial logic, as hampering the development of local players. This, in itself, ought to annoy any self-respecting player. To shine by default is hardly the best sort of prominence. And this seems to be the only way in which the Indian players are deemed capable of improving their profile.

 But there is another side to the story. The people who flock to the matches are bound to be seriously disappointed. Right from Chima Okerie in the Eighties to players like Jose Barreto, Mike Okoro and the unfortunate Cristiano Junior, foreign players have always attracted huge crowds with their superior prowess and exotic charisma. Commercially, they have become indispensable to their clubs. Their absence would put off the crowds, and therefore the sponsors as well. If Indian football, like any other modern sport, is to function as an entertainment business, then this sort of protectionism is a bad idea. Besides, for Indian players to compete with players of another stature cannot but be salutary. The business of the clubs is to win, and sports, like any other form of showbiz, is an open market ? professional resentfulness or chauvinism does not quite work here.

 And this is a lesson ? the inevitable effect of globalization ? that all forms of provincial insecurity in India will have to learn. Be it in the media, banking, insurance, higher education or legal practice, to name only a few sectors, the entry of foreign competition has transformed the very no- tion of standards and accountability. This is not to be resented, but should be seen as an entirely positive impetus for growth. The sensible thing to do is to bring the Indian players up to international standards, so that they not only become icons and crowd-pullers for their own clubs, but can also compete in the global market and go off to play in foreign teams. Banning foreign players is therefore a regressive measure that would go against the grain of a worldwide trend in most forms of competitive professional activity. Instead of anxiously levelling the playing field, it might be a better idea to open it up.

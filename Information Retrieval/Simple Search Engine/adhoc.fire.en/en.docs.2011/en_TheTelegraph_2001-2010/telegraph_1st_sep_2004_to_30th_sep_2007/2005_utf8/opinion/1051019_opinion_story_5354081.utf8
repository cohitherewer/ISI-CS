 HOW THEY ALL STACK UP

 Sanjay Kumar

 Two things hold the key to success in Bihar ?political alliances and voter turnout. While the Congress-RJD-CPI(M)-NCP alliance could give the UPA an advantage, a slight increase in turnout during the assembly elections could also brighten its electoral prospects. Traditional allies BJP and JD(U) have again managed to reach a seat-sharing arrangement. Under this, the BJP will contest 102 assembly seats while the JD(U) would put up candidates in 141. Except for the defection of a few victorious LJP candidates to the JD(U), nothing much has changed in Bihar in the last six months to indicate that the BJP-JD(U) can improve on its performance in the last polls. 

 As suggested by a survey conducted by the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, voters in Bihar are sharply divided on caste lines. Nearly 60-70 per cent of Yadavs and slightly lesser proportions of Muslims have been voting for the RJD in the last few elections. Two other dominant backward communities, the Kurmis and Koeris, favour the Samata Party-JD(U), while upper-caste voters largely vote for the BJP. Though the Dalits have always voted for the RJD, they are a divided lot. The support base of the Congress is extremely small, but it is spread across all major communities. In this sharply polarized situation, parties may find it difficult to attract new voters. 

 Strength in numbers 

 It is here that alliances will help. Since the NDA has not been able to bring any new party into its fold, it can hardly gain this time. But the coming together of the UPA partners (except for Ram Vilas Paswan) would certainly benefit all the allies. The third force, represented by the LJP-CPI-CPI(M-L) combine, could hardly better its performance of February.

 The UPA can hope to do well since all its partners seem to be happy with the seat-sharing arrangement ? the Congress with its 51 seats, the CPI(M) and NCP with their nine and eight seats respectively, and the RJD with the remaining 175 seats. The Congress has managed to get a much larger share of seats, possibly because Laloo Prasad Yadav, after his defeat in the February elections, was ready to be much more accommodative. The concessions have certainly pleased some Congressmen in Bihar. 

 According to the survey, during the February assembly polls, the turnout in Bihar dropped by as much as 18 per cent. Not only that, in the three-phased elections, the turnout kept dropping from one round to another, with the vote-share of the RJD going down in each phase. Magadh, Mithila and Tirhut, which saw a more than 20 point drop in turnout, were also the areas where the RJD suffered the heaviest losses and the BJP-JD(U) improved its tally. 

 Falling attendance 

 The RJD?s defeat in the February polls, just after its impressive victory during the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, is also explained by the fall in voter turnout by 11.6 per cent compared to the 2004 Lok Sabha elections. Here too, the survey suggests that communities which have been more enthusiastic to vote for the RJD experienced a steep fall in turnout than the rest. 

 Nevertheless, the RJD still remains one of the strongest forces in Bihar. As per the CSDS, the combined UPA has begun the new electoral race with an edge over the NDA. While in about 160 assembly constituencies, the NDA and the UPA are in keen contest, what makes the UPA?s position slightly stronger is that in the remaining 83 constituencies it has about 25 per cent votes, while the combined vote of the NDA is slightly less than 15 per cent. Smaller parties and independents may win most of these constituencies, which may be crucial in case of a hung assembly. In other words, these are the constituencies which would decide the fate of the next government.

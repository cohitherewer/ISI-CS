 THROUGH THE ROOF, AND HIGHER

 DIPANKAR BOSE

 Why do international crude oil prices continue to rise, even now when they have touched unheard of levels? To take stock ? oil prices have more than doubled since early 2004, and increased around 60 per cent over the past one year. The soaring price of crude over the last two years ? the average Brent Crude prices in the spot market rose from $30.83 in February 2004 to $71 this August 31, and is still rising ? has sent shock waves through the world. Spot crude prices fluctuate sharply around the price trend line, which has seen an extremely sharp upward trajectory since May 2004.

 What is the reason for this upheaval in the oil markets? The decade-long, 9 per cent-plus growth in China, backed by the steadily rising demand in the United States of America ? the largest oil consumer in the world ? has sent global demand into a tizzy. In early 2004, the International Energy Agency had forecast that the global oil demand in 2004 would be the highest in the past 16 years and according to estimates, would rise by 3.6 million barrels a day compared to 2003.

 More than a third of this new demand would come from China, with North America contributing another quarter. In fact, between January and August 2004, China imported 40 per cent more crude than in 2003. However, much of this import is really meant for stockpiling. This reflects the shift from holding excess dollar reserves to oil reserves. The US also has stockpiles, called the strategic petroleum reserve, and keeps adding to it. 

 Reserve strength

 It was the announcement that the US would release some of these reserves that has caused a slight fall in oil prices which had touched $71 after Hurricane Katrina struck the US?s southern coast.

 The Organization of Petro-leum Exporting Countries, which supplies nearly 40 per cent of the world demand, has raised its supply by an estimated 3.3 million barrels a day between 2002 and 2004. The non-OPEC production too increased by about 2.3 million barrels a day over the same period, led by the 1.7 million-barrels-a-day contribution from the countries of the former Soviet block.

 Intriguingly, these developments should have allayed the fears of the market, but they haven?t ? or why should the prices continue to spiral? Clearly, it is not the demand-supply equation but speculation which is causing it. 

 As it is, oil prices are based on market players? ?expectations? of demand and supply. This is also what happens in most commodity markets. But this normal process of market adjustments cannot explain the ?abnormal? price rise seen in the oil market in the past few days or ever since May 2004.

 Simply speculation 

 In reality, there has been a mad rush of funds into the oil market, pushed in by speculators who have been playing the market, directly or indirectly, in order to take advantage of the rising global demand and make a fast buck. This has vitiated the expectations of the market players and thereby upset the market processes. Of course, the onrush of funds from speculators into commodity markets is not a new phenomenon, but it is the scale of the inflows this time that has kept the price higher than even the professional forecasts made six months back.

 This also means that oil prices may stay at these high levels in the near future. Even now, the prices continue to rise, with occasional dips, because the speculators believe that it will rise further, what with the economic boom as also the stockpiling at various levels and a market driven by rumour, herd instinct and unbridled greed for profit. In other words, the phenomenon has become self-sustaining.

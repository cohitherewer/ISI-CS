 THE HAPPINESS PARADOX

 - Could life-expectancy be the one true measure of development?

 Ashok Guha

 Economic prosperity, we believe, unlocks the door to happiness. If we could only unchain Prometheus and unleash the miracle of economic growth, our intelligentsia suggests that we would find ourselves in a species of earthly paradise. All our troubles would vanish as we stepped into the golden era of economic empowerment. So axiomatic is the desirability of this end that the only question usually under debate relates to the means to achieve it. No one asks whether growth, if achieved, would better the human lot.

 While such growth fundamentalism colours all our thinking in development economics, the evidence sustaining it is amazingly feeble. In the Seventies, a large-scale international study of self-reported measures of happiness across a wide sample of countries produced what became known as Easterlin?s Paradox: happiness, it seems, is essentially independent of per capita incomes. Even more striking is the evidence of suicide rates. The suicide rate, the rate of preference for death over life, is the most irrefutable behavioural index of unhappiness. Yet national suicide rates are strongly positively correlated to per capita income: the richer a society, the more likely are its members to kill themselves.

 The popular explanation of all such anomalies runs in terms of income distribution. If well-being depends less on absolute income than on one?s relative income status, and if richer societies are also more unequal, they could well be more miserable and suicide-prone. Unfortunately, the evidence contradicts this explanation even more emphatically. Before the dissolution of the socialist world, the very high suicide rates of the Soviet Union and eastern Europe were sometimes explained as reflecting the rate at which the secret police pushed people off roofs and reported that they had jumped to their deaths. But the link between equality and suicide extended well beyond socialism and indeed outlasted it. National suicide rates today remain strongly negatively correlated to standard inequality measures: the more egalitarian a country, the keener are its citizens to embrace death.

 Perhaps the clue to the puzzle lies in our biased view of the content of economic growth. Does the positive relationship between suicide and per capita income simply reflect Amartya Sen?s thesis that welfare depends on an essentially different set of factors? Perhaps if our measure of development assigned less weight to material consumption and more to ?empowerment?, indices such as health and education, the paradox would be resolved. The facts, unfortunately, rule out such a solution. Of the Indian states, Kerala has the highest levels of health and education. It also has by far the highest suicide rates.

 It has sometimes been argued that one needs a certain level of awareness to really plumb the depths of one?s unhappiness. It is only through information about and exposure to all that life could be that we realize how truly miserable we are. The Happy Savage, sheltered in blissful ignorance, would not dream of committing suicide. But expose such savages to other ways of living before returning them irrevocably to savagery ? and they would kill themselves in droves.

 Of course, this still does not explain why Austrians or Belgians or Danes or the Swiss should commit suicide at rates fifty to a hundred times higher than Guatemalans, Peruvians, Egyptians or Indians ? not unless one assumes that the superior education and exposure of the advanced countries intensify aspirations many times more than they increase incomes. 

 More importantly, the argument implies that education (of the kind dispensed in schools and colleges) teaches us not just about the outside world but about our inner selves as well: the illiterate may not commit suicide on the same scale as the educated, but that is only because they do not know their true preferences. Implicit in this is the hypothesis that we have a common structure of underlying needs; our preferences develop out of this by adaptation to reality, by inhibitions imposed in the light of our knowledge of what is possible. Education and exposure widen our horizon of possibilities, leading to the withdrawal of inhibitions ? so that more and more of the pattern of our basic needs is unfolded. Unfortunately, modern psychology does not support the notion of an unconscious preference pattern underlying our conscious wants. Our basic drives do not exist in the subconscious as a rational ordering of alternatives but as a bundle of unresolved conflicts. Learning through interaction with the environment imposes on them a semblance of order ? confined, however, to the plane of consciousness. Below the surface, explosive subconscious impulses simmer, ready to erupt at the touch of experience in unfamiliar forms. Addictive drugs, for instance, give rise to desires and behaviour that seem to modify, indeed to violate, all one?s pre-existing preferences. Now an addiction would not generally be regarded as an upward step on some basic hierarchy of human needs.

 Yet logically, there is no distinction between an addiction and rising aspirations because of education and experience. Both result from exposure to new ways of living; both change preferences and behaviour. Indeed, gurus of the drug counter-culture from Aldous Huxley to Carlos Castaneda have argued that addictions are profound learning experiences, that drugs heighten awareness, that mescaline or peyote (or LSD) open the doors of perception and give access to ?a separate reality? from which the uninitiated have the misfortune to be excluded. We cannot reject the Huxley-Castaneda thesis if we assert that education enables us to know ourselves (as distinct from the outside world) ? not unless we make a paternalistic decision in favour of certain kinds of education and against others.

 Perhaps we should accept Easterlin?s results and the suicide evidence at face value, rather than seek to explain them away. Perhaps prosperity does not add to happiness, nor does economic growth improve the human lot. What then does it improve? What is it that grows in historical processes that we all recognize as ?growth?? The one invariable characteristic of all such processes is not an increase in well-being or even in production (which cannot be unambiguously measured when, as in all growth processes, some outputs expand and others contract); it is an improvement in biological indices, notably in life-expectancy. Is biology then what lies at the back of our minds when we speak of ?economic? growth? Could life-expect- ancy be the one true measure of development?

 The view that biological improvement, an increase in a society?s capacity to support life, is the essence of growth changes one?s perspective on the economy. Societies must adapt to support growing numbers without disastrous increases in mortality. Poor agrarian societies, for instance, must industrialize and urbanize. The complex problems of urban-industrial life, in turn, compel innumerable adaptations. Modern transport, for instance, simply meets the mobility requirements of industrialization. Modern communications link people who would never have been separated in a less modern society. The media and the entertainment industry fill the void left by the disappearance of the personal ties and the personalized entertainment of rural life. Food processing is necessitated by the separation of production from consumption, urban construction, civic amenities and public health facilities by urban congestion. 

 Most of the GDP of an advanced society is a compulsion, not a net addition to welfare. Another compulsion is an increase in isolation, alienation and suicide.

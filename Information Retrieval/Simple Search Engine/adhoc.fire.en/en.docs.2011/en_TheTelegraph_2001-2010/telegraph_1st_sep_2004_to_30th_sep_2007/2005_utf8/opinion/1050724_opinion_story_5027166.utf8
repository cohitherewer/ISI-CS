 High and rising

 Housing complexes are coming up like theres no tomorrow and the citys landscape is being altered dramatically, reports Debashis Bhattacharyya 

 Brick by brick: One of the Bengal Ambuja projects

 On either side of the 20-km Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, which links Calcuttas airport and the eastern part of the city to the south, buildings tower into the sky. A decade ago, this was a vast expanse of marshy land. Today, scores of labourers and giant cranes are at work here. Skeletal scaffolding and hordes of billboards that advertise housing projects with rooftop gardens, swimming pools and clubs have become part of the citys landscape. Nor is this construction frenzy confined to eastern Calcutta. Glitzy malls, multiplexes and condominiums are sprouting all over the city, whether its at Cossipore in the north or Jadavpur in the south. A metropolis the late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi once famously described as dying is caught in a huge construction explosion. 

 Indeed, Calcuttas skyline is being altered so dramatically that some can scarcely believe the transformation thats underway. Gazing out of his 10th-floor office in south Calcutta, Dulal Mukherjee, head of architecture firm Dulal Mukherjee amp; Associates, exclaims: Its unbelievable! Its changing so fast. The 65-year-old architect has worked on several housing projects, including South City, perhaps south Calcuttas tallest and most expensive ongoing residential project. 

 Raja Kaushal, head of the ICICI Banks retail and leisure property services in Delhi, puts Calcuttas construction boom in perspective when he declares: We are bullish about Calcutta. This is one of the emerging real estate markets in the country today along with Chennai and Pune. 

 Nearly 50 large building projects ? all 10 storied or above, with 300 to 1,800 flats ? are coming up in the city at the moment, says Pradip Kumar Chopra, secretary of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of Indias Bengal chapter. Most have swimming pools, gyms, clubs and malls ? all unthinkable five years ago. This apart, Chopra says at least 1,000 medium-sized projects ? mostly five-storied apartment buildings, with a car park on the ground floor ? are being constructed in the city, up from the 300 mid-sized apartment houses that were built in 2000. 

 Thats not all. According to construction industry men, the square feet of area under construction in the city has been growing by more than 30 per cent over the last two years. Calcutta was for a long time lagging behind other metros when it came to real estate activity. But now the tempo has built up, says Pradip Kumar Mukherjee, general manager at the Housing Development Finance Corporations (HDFC) eastern region. He says that the number of housing loans HDFC has disbursed in the city has been growing at a 30 per cent plus clip over the last couple of years. Adds he: More and more people are taking loans and buying flats. 

 This year, nearly 20 million sq. ft of floor space, both residential and commercial, is being built in the city, up from under five million sq. ft five years ago, Chopra says. Guess how much money is being poured into for this? Hold your breath: nearly Rs 5,000 crore. 

 What triggered the boom

 The construction frenzy will only accelerate. The Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association forecasts that in the next five years a mammoth 250 million sq. ft of space will be built in the Greater Calcutta area. The total investment: a huge Rs 37,500 crore, at the rate of Rs 1,500 per sq. ft. Strikingly, the boom is drawing developers from far and wide, ranging from the Delhi-based Unitech group to Prasoon Mukherjees Indonesia-based Universal Success. The two companies have combined to put up a Rs 3,000 crore office-cum-residential project for software companies and professionals at Rajarhat, the new satellite township thats barely 10 km from Calcutta airport. 

 A number of factors are prompting the construction boom ? low-interest loans are more easily available, the number of nuclear families is on the rise and the public has begun to realise that investments in real estate are safe bets. But above all, Calcutta now houses several information technology (IT) company executives. So real estate companies are zeroing in on them and on non-resident Indians (NRIs) by putting up posh flats. 

 The economic landscape in Calcutta is fast changing with the IT sector booming and companies like IBM, TCS and Wipro setting up shop in Salt Lake, explains Rahul Todi, managing director of Bengal Shrachi Housing Development Ltd. He says that software company executives bought nearly 65 per cent of the flats at two of his companys projects in New Town, Rajarhat. Ratan Sarkar, a consultant to Vision Comptech, a software development company in Salt Lake, adds that IT professionals are buying flats in the city, as they want to return from Bangalore and Hyderabad and settle down here. 

 The ups... 

 Nearly 50 

 large building projects are coming up in the city. 

 At least 1,000 medium-sized projects 

 mostly five-storied apartment buildings, with 

 a car park on the ground floor are being constructed. 

 In 2000, 300 mid-sized apartment houses were built. 

 Nearly 20 million sq. ft of floor space, 

 both residential and commercial, is being built 

 in the city, up from under five million sq. ft 

 five years ago. 

 Nearly Rs 5,000 crore is being poured into 

 construction this year. 

 ...And downs

 Builders are 

 facing a shortage of civil engineers. 

 In some parts of south Calcutta, residents 

 complain about not being able to call electricians 

 or plumbers for repair work at home, because builders 

 have engaged most of them. 

 Land prices and prices of flats are ballooning

 NRIs too are buying apartments 

 in a big way. Thats partly because real estate companies 

 have, for a few years, held road shows in London, New York 

 and Dubai; some even set up stalls at the recently concluded 

 Biswa Bengali Sammelan in New York. Bengalis in the US, 

 the UK and West Asia seem to have been attracted by the 

 citys infrastructural improvements ? five-star hotels, 

 restaurants, shopping malls, private schools and hospitals. 

 They have an emotional attachment to the city where 

 most of the them grew up and have their relatives, 

 says Jugal Khetawat, a director of South City, the company 

 set up by several other real estate companies to float the 

 South City project. NRIs have already bought more than 30 

 per cent of the projects flats. 

 Predictably, Calcuttas real estate boom has resulted in a scarcity of skilled personnel. Builders are already facing a shortage of civil engineers. In some parts of south Calcutta, residents grumble about not being able to call electricians or plumbers for repair work at home, because builders have engaged most of them. 

 What is more, land prices and prices of flats are ballooning. Khetawat, who is president of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association, says the land prices have almost doubled over the last two years, while the prices of flats have increased by 20 to 30 per cent. In 2001, flats in Rajarhat, for instance, were sold for Rs 1,000 per sq. foot. Apartments in the area now fetch Rs 1,500-1,600 per sq. foot. In the upscale neighbourhoods of New Alipore and Ballygunge, apartments are now priced at Rs 3,300-3,500 per sq. foot, up from Rs 2,500-2,700 per sq. foot in 2001. 

 All for a good bargain

 Nonetheless, prices are still lower in Calcutta than in most big cities. You get a decent flat at Rajarhat for Rs 1,500 per sq. ft, but a similar flat in, say, Gurgaon or Noida on the outskirts of New Delhi will cost you at least Rs 2,500 per sq. foot, notes Harshvardan Neotia, managing director of Bengal Ambuja Housing Development Ltd. 

 Calcuttas construction boom has other pluses too. Ravi Poddar, eastern regional chairman of the Confederation of Indian Industry, says that the boom is pushing more investment into the city, throwing up more job opportunities and showcasing Calcuttas growing economic prowess. More than anything else, the rising construction activity shows that Calcutta is alive and kicking. Its not a dying or dead city, Poddar says wryly, referring to Rajiv Gandhis statement. 

 With the state government too foraying into the real estate sector by floating eight joint sector companies (Bengal Ambuja is one of them), Neotia says there has been an overall improvement in the quality of construction. There is also greater transparency in property deals, Neotia adds. Thats because, as housing minister Goutam Deb points out, promoters of housing projects are now required to register with his department and submit all details of their projects before they can start work. 

 Not everyone agrees. Prabir Basu, working president of the Bengal Federation of Consumer Organisations, argues that many builders do not often provide what they charge their buyers for. They tell you they will give you a multi-gym and charge you for that, but in the end provide only a treadmill and an exercise cycle. They also often delay giving possession, Basu says. 

 Builders, meanwhile, fret that the huge amount of construction in Calcutta will lead to oversupply. It will happen in five years, Khetawat says. Till then, though, Mukherjee and other architects and builders will burn the midnight oil to complete the hordes of buildings that are coming up. 

 The skyline is changing, and there 

 is work to be done.

 Calcutta 2025: Ring roads, 

 health city, biotech park

 Cars will zip down broad, leafy 

 ring roads that encircle the city. The ring roads will be 

 lined with garden-fronted highrises and glass-and-marble 

 shopping arcades. The city will have three new townships. 

 And it could perhaps be the medical capital of the region, 

 catering to overseas patients on its outskirts will 

 be a health city with super-speciality hospitals and medical 

 and nursing colleges, apart from a biotechnology park. 

 No, were not referring to 

 New Delhi or Bangalore. In 2025, thats what Calcutta 

 will look like if the Calcutta Metropolitan Development 

 Authority (CMDA) has its way. 

 CMDA CEO P.R. Baviskar says that 

 the population of the Calcutta metropolitan area 

 made up of three corporations, 38 municipalities and 22 

 Panchayat Samitys is expected to balloon from 14.69 

 million to 21 million in two decades. Consequently, the 

 demand for roads and houses will soar. 

 Baviskar says the government will 

 build two ring roads (an inner ring road and an outer ring 

 road, just like the ones New Delhi has) to speed up traffic 

 flow. To build the inner ring road, the proposed Eastern 

 Expressway, Southern Expressway, Belgharia Expressway and 

 National Highway 2 and 6 will be connected by building 116 

 km of new roads. 

 Similarly, 72 km of new roads 

 will be constructed to build the outer ring road that will 

 run around the Calcutta metropolitan area. The roads 

 are already there. So, all we have to do is join the missing 

 links, Baviskar says. 

 Three new satellite townships 

 will be built in Howrah, on the other side of the Hooghly 

 river, Dankuni (about 15 km from Calcutta) and Baruipur 

 (now a small town about 12 km from Calcutta). They 

 will relieve the pressure on Calcutta to a large extent, 

 the CMDA CEO says. 

 Work on the 390-acre township 

 in Howrah has already begun and will be partly complete 

 by 2008. Nearly 5,000 acres of land have been earmarked 

 for the project in Dankuni, while the Baruipur township 

 will cover 2,600 acres. Work in Dankuni and Baruipur is 

 expected to start in a year. 

 Once the new township comes up in Baruipur in 2008 or so, 

 the headquarters of South 24 Parganas district still 

 in Calcuttas Alipore will be shifted there. 

 Dankuni township is expected to be functional, at least 

 partly, by 2011. 

 The health city will come up over 800 acres in Sonarpur, 

 around 10 km from Calcutta. Some Rs 20,000 crore will be 

 invested in it. According to Sajal Dutta, president of the 

 Association of Hospitals of Eastern India, whos involved 

 in the project, at least 100 hospitals with a total capacity 

 of 50,000 beds will come up in the health city, aimed mainly 

 at patients from Southeast and West Asia. The city will 

 also house medical and nursing colleges and training institutes 

 for paramedics. 

 The biotechnological park, Baviskar says, will come up 

 over 200 acres in the city. Several biotechnology companies 

 have shown interest in setting up research and development 

 facilities here. But the site has not yet been finalised. 

 It could be either in Sonarpur or in Rajarhat, barely 10 

 km from Calcutta airport where a satellite township called 

 New Town is coming up. 

 Clearly, cartographers will have to redraw the citys 

 map in the years ahead.

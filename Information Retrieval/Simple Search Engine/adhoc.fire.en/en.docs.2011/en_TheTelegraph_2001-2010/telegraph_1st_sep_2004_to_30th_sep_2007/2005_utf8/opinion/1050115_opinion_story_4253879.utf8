 THEY?RE ONLY ANIMALS

 Around 10 million are slaughtered each year ? and there are no survivors. But, instead of slitting their throats after stunning them in electrified water, gas chambers are now being pondered. The subject here are chickens, killed and cooked annually by McDonald?s, which now wants to be kinder to the birds. Yet most 21st-century minds will instantly make other connections. History has a disconcerting habit of repeating tragedy as farce. Even the Holocaust is sometimes not spared. To many, though, the mass slaughter of animals for human consumption is a profoundly serious issue. And the advocacy of principled vegetarianism has often used the Holocaust to make its point about organized cruelty. This, in turn, has led to the larger ethical question of whether the Holocaust could at all be ?compared? to anything other than itself. To say that Jews died like cattle, therefore cattle die like Jews is strongly objected to by many, Jewish or otherwise. This insults the memory of the human dead, and is founded on a gross misunderstanding of how two distinct events happen to be ?like? each other.

 A couple of years ago, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals launched its ?Holocaust on Your Plate? campaign to promote a vegetarian diet. PeTA took a giant graphic display around America consisting of panels on which pictures of chickens, calves and pig carcasses were juxtaposed with images of Holocaust victims and a mound of human corpses. PeTA followed this up ? to general outrage ? with appealing to Yasser Arafat to stop using explosive-laden donkeys for bomb-attacks in the West Bank. Yet those who speak of the short and miserable life of chickens as an ?eternal Treblinka? trace their metaphor back to the writings of a Jewish survivor and Nobel laureate. Isaac Bashevis Singer?s vegetarianism was a direct consequence of his encounter with Nazi Europe. In relation to animals, ?all people are Nazis?, he wrote, ? There will be no justice as long as man will stand with a knife or with a gun and destroy those who are weaker than he is.? And it was Theodor Adorno, one of the most austere theorists of the Holocaust, who thought that Auschwitz begins ?wherever someone looks at a slaughterhouse and thinks: They?re only animals.?

 It does not take a principled vegetarian to recognize the seriousness of the connections made by Singer and Adorno. It might be risking blasphemy to equate the slaughter of calves, pigs and chickens with the systematic extermination of Jews, gypsies and homosexuals. Yet, if the Holocaust has taught mankind anything at all, then it is the fact that the everyday lives of ordinary human beings could accommodate kinds and degrees of violence, cruelty and perversion of control without making any noticeable rents in the texture of ?normalcy?. And the roots of mercy itself can lie in the perverse. Even PeTA thinks that chickens will die a more merciful death in McDonald?s new gas chambers with their state-of-the-art ?controlled-atmosphere killing?.

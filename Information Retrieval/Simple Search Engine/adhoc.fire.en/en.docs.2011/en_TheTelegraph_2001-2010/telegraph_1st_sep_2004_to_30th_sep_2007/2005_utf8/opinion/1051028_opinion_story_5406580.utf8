 CUTTING WEDGE

 A small step for Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee but a profound shift for Indian politics. That is the best way to sum up the resolution of the politburo of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) on the information technology sector. The resolution, given its profound implications, is a remarkably short one and its real significance lies embedded within rhetoric. But the rhetoric should not obfuscate the significance. The chief minister of West Bengal, after his experience during the bandh of September 29, had expressed the view that IT should be kept outside the ambit of strikes. The Centre of Indian Trade Unions leadership, even though it has not even a toehold in the IT sector in West Bengal or anywhere else in India, found Mr Bhattacharjee?s position unacceptable. This was the context of the discussion in the politburo. The reiteration by the politburo that the right to form trade unions and to collective bargaining should exist in the IT sector is meaningless since this is a right given by the Constitution. Similarly, the wise men of the CPI(M) need not have reminded anyone that labour laws of the land are applicable to the IT sector. This is self-evident. Up to this point, the resolution seems to be running against Mr Bhattacharjee. But after the rhetoric comes the reality, after the irrelevant, the relevant.

 The last sentence of the resolution announces that the nature of work and services in the IT sector is being brought under the purview of a special study to be placed before the party?s central committee. This is an admission by the CPI(M) leadership that the IT sector needs to be looked at separately and specially. This is a small but a very important step in the orientation and attitude of the CPI(M), a party which in the not-so-distant past was anti-computers. Today, IT stands at the cutting edge of industrialization, especially in West Bengal, where IT is a key element in the chief minister?s wooing of investment. This concession suggests that the comrades are willing to review their shibboleths on strikes and trade unions. IT is the thin end of the wedge. The politburo is not even unwilling to let the state party unit decide on how the IT sector should be treated during a bandh. This will permit the state unit to regulate the Citu. In the Thirties, the high noon of communism, comrades believed that time was on their side. Now Mr Bhattacharjee can make such a claim without any hyperbole.

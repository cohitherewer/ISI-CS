 DO NOT GO GENTLE

 It is sometimes better to die than to have nothing to look forward to. If geriatric suicide is on the rise in urban India, then the logic behind a great many of them is surely born out of this feeling of desolation ? a combination of intense loneliness and a feeling of helplessness with the demands of everyday life. Yet, the suicide of 64-year-old Ranjit Chakraborty on Thursday does not quite fit this profile. He and his wife lived with both their sons and their families, were financially independent, and had their own kitchen. He was not lonely, but felt helpless in the face of filial abuse. Chakraborty and his wife were regularly abused by their older son and daughter-in-law, who even threatened to beat him up on the day that he took his own life. The daughter-in-law would threaten to bring charges of domestic violence against them when her father-in-law mentioned the police.

 Chakraborty?s suicide note ? written on the computer ? clearly spells out this inadequacy of the law, which protects women from domestic abuse and torture, but fails to address the vulnerability of the elderly in the hands of their sons and daughters. In this case, Chakraborty?s son and daughter-in-law have been booked on charges of ?abetment of suicide?. Chakraborty was right. There is a gap in the law, and the courts have often admonished the police for not being more vigilant regarding filial abuse or abandonment. But the police have also expressed a real feeling of helplessness in the face of the scale and ?privateness? of the problem. Police vigilance is bound to be an inadequate solution to a phenomenon that goes on behind closed doors. And this is where a more community-based approach to the problem, at least in urban Middle India, is necessary. (The situation in rural India, more desperately poor, is just as critical, though less well charted.) The twin unbearables ? loneliness and abuse ? can only be managed in that uncertain terrain of collective responsibility that lies between the welfare state and civil society. Moving from West Bengal to Kerala, it is significant that in spite of the latter?s remarkable progress in the health, education and service sectors, it has the highest suicide rate in India, and nearly 50 per cent of those who have committed suicide there in the last few years are between 45 and 65 years old. Every year, lawyers in Kerala are flooded with requests from the elderly for getting legal sanction to take their own lives.

 It is perhaps best to start with the basic areas of anxiety for the elderly: physical security, medical emergencies and financial management. To create an infrastructure of support, neighbourhood volunteers, family members, banks, hospitals, educational institutions, NGOs and the police will have to work concertedly. Organizations like the Indian Association for Retired Persons and Dignity Foundation are working out models of cooperation along these lines which can only be sustained by networks that must, at some crucial levels, be recognized and supported by the state.

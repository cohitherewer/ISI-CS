 WHAT?S THE LINE?

 What is this government?s official line on homosexuality? Many Indians, whatever their sexual orientation, might wish to have a clear answer to this question with increasing urgency. Anybody who has thought through the notion of fundamental rights in a democracy would want to ascertain his government?s stance on sexual justice. Anybody aware of the basic facts regarding HIV/AIDS would be worried about his country continuing to punish homosexuals as criminals. How far has India managed to catch up with the human imperatives of the 21st century? Mr Manmohan Singh is one of India?s more erudite prime ministers. He will also head the National AIDS Control Organization. So when he publicly trips on a foreign journalist?s query regarding his views on same-sex marriage, one wishes to give him the benefit of the doubt. Perhaps he really had not heard her properly, and this is what he meant by ?not understand[ing]? her question. But he also added that he did not think ?such a thing will have wide acceptance? in his country. As prime minister, is he identifying with this assumed consensus, or is he distancing himself critically from it? And what is his assumption founded on?

 Article 377 of the Indian Penal Code is used to criminalize male homosexuality as ?against the order of nature?. The prime minister?s answer echoes the previous, Bharatiya Janata Party-led government?s words on why this law should not be changed: it is not yet time to naturalize homosexuality in Indian society, let alone same-sex marriages. And the opposite ends of the Indian party-political spectrum seem to have come together on this. Moreover, their agreement on this issue is being projected publicly as a popular consensus. Decades of campaigning and activism, changing attitudes and images in the media, and growing visibility and openness in the lives of individuals and communities are negated by such declarations. Recently, both the police and the duty magistrate in Amritsar had refused to intervene when two women chose to live together after letting their families know that they are now ?married? for all practical purposes. Yet these changes are taking place against the current of deeply entrenched prejudice, oppression and denial. It is, therefore, necessary to find out whether India?s learned prime minister endorses these signs of change or continues to stand for the older and benighted ways of evasion and injustice.

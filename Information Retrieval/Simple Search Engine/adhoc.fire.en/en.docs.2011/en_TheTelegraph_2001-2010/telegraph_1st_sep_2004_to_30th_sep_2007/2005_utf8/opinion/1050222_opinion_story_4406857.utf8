 BABUS DON?T TRAVEL

 MALVIKA SINGH

 This year, India has been through a tourism boom. There are no hotel rooms available for love or money anywhere in Delhi or in Rajasthan. The grapevine says that it is the same story across India. Hurray for the industry, but very sad that the government of India and the state governments have not recognized that this rapidly growing sector has stepped out of its traditional box and is fast becoming an intrinsic part of the development process of the country. Today, the ministry of tourism can play the dynamic role of a catalyst, and trigger substantial growth by encouraging the private sector to become proactive. The old paradigm has cracked open and a new one needs urgent structuring to deal with the new avatar of travel and tourism.

 The prime minister must look at this ministry as an economic ministry, one that is high on the priority list. To have segregated culture from tourism was the first mistake because the two are intrinsically linked. That needs to be rectified. It was Indira Gandhi who believed that culture, tourism and environment were all important areas for any country?s growth. Governments that followed did not share the same far-sightedness. They consciously diluted these ministries and killed their economic potential, setting us back by decades. It is time to change that archaic mindset and to look at this area of economic activity from a fresh and vibrant position.

 If the tourism sector is re visited and restructured, benefits will accrue for all and virtually across the board. Opportunity, and therefore motivation and entrepreneurship, will unleash productivity. This, in itself, will trigger growth but only if the babu stands apart, lets go and allows those in the business to get on with their business. The government and its many ministries that dovetail into one another to facilitate the tourism industry must do that alone and no more. To control this sector at this time would be tantamount to strangling it.

 Endless whys

 Put tourism on the concurrent list, work out the methodology where the Centre and the states could work in tandem to ensure a national norm for the sector within which they could keep intact their diverse, special and unusual regional identities. People must participate in the entire exercise. Visitors from India and from other countries must be helped to ?experience? the ethos and soul of India, not just ?view? it from a safe distance as they do today. To ?package? India for the visitor, based on some alien Western model, is silly. We need to entice the traveller, the new world-explorer, the curious young men and women who people our globalized world. There is another generation out there that wants to break the existing paradigm. They are the ones who are mobile and who are looking for new experiences in new areas. Some will travel in search of music, others will wander a foodie trail, many will seek quiet wilderness spaces. Freedom to do simple things based on simple whims is what will attract travellers. India has all of that. India makes no value judgments, which is why India is different. It is that difference we have to share.

 With some facilitation, this industry could truly boom. Why can?t every state capital have an international airport? Why can?t roads be maintained? Why can?t we keep the excreta off the roads? Why can?t we have clean public loos? Why can?t we have honest money-changing facilities? Why can?t we get our act together on these simple issues? Why do our embassies abroad take forever to issue visas? Why are the airports and railway stations so unclean, smelly and unpleasant? Why are we beset by these endless whys?

 The prime minister needs to recognize these realities and run a vacuum-cleaner over them. If that is done, we shall be on our way.

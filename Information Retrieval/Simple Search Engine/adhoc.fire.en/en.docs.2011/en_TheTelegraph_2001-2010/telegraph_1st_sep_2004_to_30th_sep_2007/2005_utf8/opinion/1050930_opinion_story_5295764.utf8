 BIRTH OF THE RED LEAGUE

 History of the Communist Movement in India: The formative years 1920-1933, Vol. 1, CPI(M) Publications, Rs 450 

 While leafing through this volume, it becomes clear to the reader that it comprises a chain of events that does not offer much by way of analysis. Many of the events mentioned in it can be found in other writings on workers? and peasants? movements in India. However, the compilation of so many events in a single compendium makes the book interesting.

 The volume talks about wide ranging events that are separated by time and space ? from Karl Marx?s insightful, but factually incorrect, writings on India to the formal recognition of the Communist Party of India by the (third) Communist International. 

 Many of the events mentioned here are fascinating. There is a reference to an article written by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee in which he advocated the abolition of private property. One also learns that the Programme of National Liberation and Reconstruction, signed by M.N. Roy and Abani Mukherjee and distributed in the annual session of the Indian National Congress in Gaya, contained a proposal to arm an entire people instead of maintaining a standing army. 

 There are vivid descriptions of the Peshawar, Kanpur and Meerut conspiracy cases which prove that communists had participated in the struggle for independence. The record of peasants? and workers? struggles, which grew in number and intensity during the Great Depression, also shows that the toiling masses had partaken of the anti-imperialist movement.

 The book has its share of problems though. For instance, the differences between Indian and Chinese Communist parties have not been alluded to. Neither does it explain why Indian communists failed to pose a challenge to Gandhi?s leadership despite their sacrifices. The use of terms like ?left-sectarianism? and ?right opportunism? have been supplemented without examples, making it difficult to understand their meanings in the Indian context.

 One does not have to be a follower of left politics to understand that in British India, those who professed to be socialists and communists dreamt sincerely of a classless society which could only be achieved through revolutionary means.Unfortunately, present day members of the two major Indian Communist parties do not cherish such lofty ideals anymore. The question that needs to be asked is whether this dream is still relevant in the modern world. If it is not so, then this volume, although useful to students and scholars alike, has little operational significance for the members of the two Indian Communist parties.

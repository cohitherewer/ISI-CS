 STILL VULNERABLE TO DISEASE AND DEATH

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the Human Development Report 2005

 Beyond the human development index, very large deficits in human capability remain. Metaphors...distract attention from...the extraordinary level of...deprivation that prevails in the midst of an increasingly prosperous world...

 There is no more powerful, or disturbing, ...indicator of capability deprivation than child mortality. More than 10 million children die each year before their fifth birthday. Sub-Saharan Africa?s share of child mortality is growing. The region accounts for 20 per cent of births but 44 per cent of child deaths ...Every two minutes four people die from malaria alone, three of them children. Most of these deaths could be prevented by simple, low-cost interventions. Vaccine-preventable illnesses ? like measles, diphtheria and tetanus ? account for another 2-3 million childhood deaths. For every child who dies, millions more...fall sick or miss school, trapped in a vicious circle that links poor health in childhood to poverty in adulthood. Like the 500,000 women who die each year of pregnancy-related causes, more than 98 per cent of children who die each year live in poor countries...

 Progress in reducing poverty has been partial. One in five people in the world ? more than 1 billion people ? still survive on less than $1 a day, a level of poverty so abject that it threatens survival. Another 1.5 billion people live on $1-$2 a day. More than 40 per cent of the world?s population constitute, in effect, a global underclass, faced daily with the reality or the threat of extreme poverty.

 In a world of plenty, millions of people go hungry every day. More than 850 million people...are still trapped in a vicious cycle of malnutrition and its effects. Malnutrition weakens the immune system, increasing the risk of ill health...Around half of the deaths of preschool children are directly attributable to...malnutrition and infectious disease. Children who are moderately under weight are more than four times more likely to die from infectious disease than are well nourished children.

 In turn, vulnerability to infectious disease is exacerbated by inadequate access to clean water and sanitation. More than 1 billion people lack access to safe water and 2.6 billion...to improved sanitation. Diseases transmitted through water or human waste are the second leading cause of death among children worldwide...The overall death toll: an estimated 3,900 children every day.

 Gaps in opportunities for education remain...In a...knowledge-based global economy about 115 million children are denied even the most basic primary education. Most of the children who are not enrolled in school are in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia...Average schooling in South Asia, at eight years, is half the level in high-income countries. Moreover, while the primary school enrolment gap may be closing, the gap between rich and poor countries...is widening...Access to higher education remains a privilege available mainly to citizens of high-income countries. These education inequalities of today are the global social and economic inequalities of tomorrow.

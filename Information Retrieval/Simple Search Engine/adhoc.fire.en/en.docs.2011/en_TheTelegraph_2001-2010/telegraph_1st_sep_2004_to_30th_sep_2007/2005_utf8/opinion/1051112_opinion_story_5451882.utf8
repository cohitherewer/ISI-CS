 Letters to Editor

 Kick the habit

 Sir ? The news that the British American Tobacco company is planning to launch ?safer cigarettes? is certain to raise a few laughs. Smoking such ?safe? cigarettes will be like jumping from the 15th floor instead of the 20th! Smoking is a dangerous habit and many get hooked on to it early in life. Perhaps, a total ban on the manufacture and sale of cigarettes, on the lines of Bhutan and Ireland, would help other countries wean their populations from their addiction.

 Yours faithfully,

 Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 High on promise

 Sir ? The editorial ?Promise of Buddha? (Nov 6) states that the chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, has unfolded an age of promise, and asks whether the people of West Bengal can now look forward to the age of delivery. Unless the chief minister forces the state machinery to shrug off its complacency and start functioning better, the people?s aspirations are likely to remain a pipe dream. As of now, each government department works as if it were a sovereign body in itself. The delivery mechanism is riddled with failures. It takes ages to get files moving from one table to another and there are too many intermediaries on the way. With such a primitive system in place, it is not surprising to hear that the state backward classes welfare department allegedly sat on an application to the Centre for assistance to tribals for nine long months.

 Yours faithfully,

B.K. Banerjee, Jhargram

 Sir ? No one can deny that Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has tried to correct West Bengal?s past mistakes. However, it is doubtful whether he will succeed in fulfilling his promises. The mandarins at Alimuddin Street call the shots and Bhattacharjee would not dare to defy them in order to realize his vision. Moreover, Bhattacharjee?s promise to rid the party of hooligans should be taken with a pinch of salt. Surely, the people know by now that it is muscle power that has kept the party in power for more than a quarter of a century.

 Yours faithfully,

Govinda Bakshi, Budge Budge

 Sir? That the Marxists in West Bengal have realized, albeit a bit late in the day, that mere words do not produce desired results is a good sign. Under the Marxists, West Bengal has fared poorly in all sectors, be it in industry, health or education. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) will do well to remember that neither capitalism nor communism is the answer to the problems that plague society. The difference between the right and the left is now wafer-thin, and most political parties today consider the welfare of the state as their primary concern. Private capital is encouraged everywhere since it produces results. Therefore, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s decision to encourage the private sector is a pragmatic step, although radical Marxists may accuse him of being a revisionist.

 Yours faithfully

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

 Sir ? West Bengal had languished for more than two decades under the misrule of Jyoti Basu. Now, with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at the helm, the Marxists are trying their best to reform in order to make up for the loss. But the chief minister should remember that an industrial resurgence is not enough. Bhattacharjee has to focus on the improvement of other sectors like education, health and infrastructure. Restoring a non-existent work culture and getting rid of corruption should also be on Bhattacharjee?s mind when he plans out Bengal?s future.

 Yours faithfully,

Sudarsan Nandi, Midnapore

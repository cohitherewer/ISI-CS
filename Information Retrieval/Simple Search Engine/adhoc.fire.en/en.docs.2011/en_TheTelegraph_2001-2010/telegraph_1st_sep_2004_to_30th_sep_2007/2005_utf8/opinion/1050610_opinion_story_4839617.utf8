 KICKED INTO SHAPE

 Football Confidential

 By Ian Bent, Richard McIlroy, Kevin Mousley and Peter Walsh, BBC, ?5 

 A revolution took place in Belgium in the mid-Nineties. A football player and his advocate got together to prove that football was no longer a recreational activity but a full-time profession. No player could be exploited by clubs or agents, or denied the right to move around the world, seeking the best possible deal for himself. For long, football authorities in Europe, particularly Britain, had maintained a vice-like grip on players. The football player would be bound to the club even after his contract was over. 

 Today, sports governing bodies can no longer claim such authority. Professional sports is big business and like all big business, must have its business ethics. Sports has been brought under the European Economic Commission, with its rules and systems to enforce free circulation of players, freedom of choice, execution of service rules and so on. Overnight, clubs floated their shares on the bourses, and television and broadcasting rights began to be sold for large amounts. As football became commercialized, a new breed of organizers, agents, administrators and consultants emerged.

 Ironically, the complaints came from within the system. People who had so far ruled football with an iron hand felt trapped. Now they had to fall in with the legal provisions.

 But the new breed was pragmatic enough to realize that merely earning huge amounts did not mean professionalism or superiority. Take the case of the English football players versus the Scandinavian ones. English players in the Nineties were full-time performers and earned a lot of money. Consequently, they underestimated the Scandinavian players, who played only part-time and did not command hefty fees. But regular defeats at the hands of the Scandinavians, both at the club and international level, opened the eyes of the English football administrators, who realized that professionalism and commercialization were two different things. Today, north European nations export not only top-class footballers but also coaches and managers to Britain. 

 Another popular misconception is related to the role of science in sports. Even a decade ago in Europe, the treatment of sports-related injuries was in the hands of people who had little or no idea of treatment, rest or recuperation. Thankfully, eminent clubs like Manchester United appointed qualified and experienced doctors to attend to sports injuries, thereby opening the door for other clubs to follow suit.

 Football Confidential talks about the new dimensions of soccer ? sponsorships and contracts; hooliganism; the adoption or rejection of sports psychology; the shocking state of medical care; dreadful ground conditions at the lower levels; the general lethargy, complacency and confusion of football administrators. It focuses on real problems and mentions people and clubs by name. This gives it a ring of credibility. 

 At a time when India is contemplating a professional set-up for soccer, our policy-makers would do well to realize that it would entail a wide spectrum of back-up support. Merely offering large sums of money to mediocre players and coaches does not mean professionalism. In a country where callous and weak-kneed soccer officials cannot even chalk out a definite calendar of tournaments or specific rules about promotion and relegation of teams, such professionalism would only lead to further confusion.

 If it has been determined...that a public health emergency of international concern is occurring, the Director-General shall issue temporary recommendations in accordance with the procedure set out...Such temporary recommendations may be modified or extended as appropriate, including after it has been determined that a public health emergency of international concern has ended, at which time other temporary recommendations may be issued as necessary for the purpose of preventing or promptly detecting its recurrence. 

 Temporary recommendations may include health measures to be implemented by the State Party experiencing the public health emergency...or by other States Parties, regarding persons, baggage, cargo, containers, conveyances, goods and/or postal parcels to prevent or reduce the international spread of disease and avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic. 

 Temporary recommendations may be terminated in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 49 at any time and shall automatically expire three months after their issuance. They may be modified or extended for additional periods of up to three months.... 

 WHO may make standing recommendations of appropriate health measures in accordance with Article 53 for routine or periodic application. Such measures may be applied by States Parties...for specific, ongoing public health risks in order to prevent or reduce the international spread of disease and avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic... 

 When issuing, modifying or terminating temporary or standing recommendations, the Director-General shall consider: 

 (a) the views of the States Parties directly concerned; (b) the advice of the Emergency Committee or the Review Committee... (c) scientific principles as well as available scientific evidence and information; (d) health measures that... are not more restrictive of international traffic and trade and are not more intrusive to persons than reasonably available alternatives that would achieve the appropriate level of health protection; (e) relevant international standards and instruments; (f) activities undertaken by other relevant intergovernmental organizations and international bodies; and (g) other appropriate and specific information relevant to the event.

 RECIPE FOR DISASTER

 Gwynne Dyer

 Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, South Africa?s recently appointed deputy president, has a sense of humour, so maybe she was just joking. But it was the political equivalent of shouting ?fire? in a crowded theatre, what she had to say at a conference in Johannesburg last week. ?Land reform in South Africa has been too slow and too structured. There needs to be a bit of ?oomph?. That?s why we may need the skills of Zimbabwe to help us. On agrarian and land reform, South Africa should learn some lessons from Zimbabwe ? how to do it fast.?

 As investors hit the panic button and the people who run South Africa?s economy tore their hair out in despair, Mlambo-Ngcuka?s spokesman insisted that her remarks were made in jest. Perhaps. 

 Zimbabwe was, until the end of the Nineties, a repressive but modestly prosperous country ruled by an ageing leader of the independence struggle, Robert Mugabe. It was only after voters rejected his plan to make the country a one-party state (and thereby assure him the presidency for life) in a 2000 referendum that he turned to extreme measures in an attempt to rebuild his popularity. Primary among them was a plan to confiscate land from prosperous white commercial farmers and ?redistribute? it to poor, landless blacks.

 Populism reigns 

 About half the seized land went to Mugabe?s cronies and allies in the ruling party and the military. Some of the rest did go to poor peasants, but they had neither the tools nor the skills for large-scale commercial farming. About half of Zimbabwe?s best farmland now lies fallow, the economy has shrunk by 30 per cent since 1999, average income per head is now lower than in 1980, and half the population now needs emergency food aid. Is this what Mlambo-Ngcuka has in mind for South Africa?

 The African National Congress regime has walked a tightrope ever since taking control 11 years ago. Most black South Africans still vote for it, but they expect rapid action to narrow the wide gap between their living standards and those of the whites, Asians, and mixed-race ?Coloureds?, who make up one-fifth of the country?s 45 million people. The trouble is that these minorities own most of the businesses and possess most of the skills that South Africa needs if it is to remain a modern industrial economy.

 This must change in time, but the change must be gradual if the economy is not to be destroyed. The ANC must continue to walk the political tightrope for at least another decade if South Africa is to become a stable and prosperous multi-racial democracy. Occasionally the leadership panics and decides a populist gesture is needed ? and that is the charitable explanation for Mlambo-Ngcuka?s remarks.

 Fast forward

 Eighty-seven per cent of South Africa?s farmland was white-owned when Nelson Mandela took over in 1994; 85 per cent still is today. So late last month the government announced that it was abandoning the market-based ?willing buyer-willing seller? programme of land redistribution because it is too slow.

 White farmers say there are plenty of ?willing sellers?, but that they cannot get the government to buy their land. It doesn?t matter who?s right. It doesn?t even matter all that much if a ?fast-track? programme of taking land from whites and handing it to blacks destroys South Africa?s position as one of only six net food exporters in the world. Unlike Zimbabwe, South Africa is mostly urban with a fully developed economy, and agriculture is not a very big part of it.

 What does matter is that both South African and foreign investors continue to see the country as a place where it is the law, and not party politics, that makes the rules. Get that wrong, and you lose everything. Mlambo-Ngcuka really should mind her mouth.

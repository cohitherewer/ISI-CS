 Letters to Editor

 Slip of tongue

 Sir ? I don?t quite understand how premarital sex affects the honour and dignity of women (?Premarital sex is ok...Oops! its not?, Sept 27). This is a free country and any adult woman has the freedom to do and be what she wants. Why should that bother anyone? Why is such a premium put on virginity? However, it is not the reality that bothers organizations such as the Pattali Makkal Katchi. The fact that a woman has had the courage to come out openly on such issues is what has upset the party. What bothers it is that women are using the limited freedom they enjoy (including free speech) to challenge traditional, patriarchal notions of womanhood. There is no opprobrium attached to the male having premarital sex.

 Kushboo has also reportedly said that no educated man expects his wife to be a virgin any longer. She may or may not be right, but she has the right to make her opinion known. Some organizations have seen this as an insult to motherhood. Why? Maybe because they see women as desexualized reproductive machines. All the other identities of women have to be subsumed under the one primordial identity of motherhood. These organizations cannot conceive of a motherhood which negotiates the issue of premarital sex in a modern, freedom-loving way. In any case, no mother is expected to discuss her sex life with her children. That is a private matter. So where is the problem? 

 The secret of all fascisms ? both of the left and right ? is the repression of female sexuality. Promoting the cult of motherhood is one way of doing this. Witness the hypertrophe of motherhood in Hitler?s Germany and Stalin?s Soviet Union. These organizations want to cow women down, to make them conform to the patriarchal values they uphold.

 Yours faithfully,

Soumitro Das, Calcutta

 Sir ? Just the other day, Kushboo had stated that educated men no longer expected their spouses to be virgin at the time of marriage. Her remarks were not well-taken by political parties and apolitical organizations which purport to be the custodians of Indian culture. Not unsurprisingly, there was Kushboo the next day, coerced to issue a statement apologizing to the ?Tamil people? for committing the sin of expressing her personal views on sex in public. 

 The following incident that took place in 1963 will, hopefully, serve as an eye-opener to those living in a fool?s paradise. An 18-year-old girl I was lunching with admitted, in the course of our conversation on movies, marriage, love, sex and social values, that she had no intention of following the no-sex-before-marriage rule. ?Why should one feel guilty about sex and sexual pleasure?, she asked, ?when going to bed with the right kind of person can give complete satisfaction ? physical, mental and emotional?? If my girlfriend was a virgin at the time I met her, it was not because she was afraid of getting pregnant before marriage, but because she had, till then, not met the ?right kind of person?. She was at least honest and forthright, but most of us are self-righteous hypocrites.

 Till recently, sex outside marriage was considered wicked, sinful, immoral and abnormal because sex and marriage were held to be synonymous. But a new generation of youths has arrived, unfettered by the dogmatic beliefs of the church, mosque or the temple. Paradoxical though it may seem, almost all the young people I know who are willing to experiment, preserve their virginity fiercely. But no longer on grounds of principles or feelings of shame which so often pass for chastity or virtue. 

 Yours faithfully,

Omar Luther King, Delhi

 Sir ? It is unbelievable that a lady with sandal paste on her forehead can say such offensive words on female sexuality. It is understood that Indian women have always held a conservative attitude towards sex. And yet Kushboo, despite her upbringing in Indian society and a successful career in a deeply conservative Tamil Nadu, can shoot her mouth without care. Taslima Nasreen, it seems, now has serious competition. Although Kushboo has publicly apologized for her comments, it is unlikely that will be enough for damage control. She has undermined the Indian tradition and her fans might not forget that in a hurry.

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? On my last visit to Calcutta in August, I was pleasantly surprised by the ubiquity of billboards and media advertisements teaching safe sex to the laymen. Although this definitely is a right step towards public enlightenment, it misses out two important points. One, many of these advertisements are in English and it is doubtful how far they can penetrate the general population. Two, and more importantly, all of them advise on the importance of safe sex and regular check-ups, but not on the necessity to dispel the stigma associated with AIDS. In a country where AIDS patients are subjected to inhuman cruelty and social ostracism, the public, even those who do not consider themselves to be possible victims, must be made aware of the facts regarding the disease. Only a few weeks back, we heard about a mother throwing her infant into the well for fear of the disease. If the government continues to sleep through this, the hapless victims will be fighting a losing battle.

 Yours faithfully,

Soumik Pal, Calcutta

 Role call

 Sir ? The report, ?Another nail in swami coffin? (Sept 20), makes a gross error by describing Sir Mirza Ismail as the ?king of the erstwhile state of Mysore?. He was the diwan of the Mysore State and other states as well. The Wodeyars were the rulers of Mysore after Tipu Sultan was killed by the army of Lord Wellesley.

 Yours faithfully,

R.K. Chakrabarti Thakur, Calcutta

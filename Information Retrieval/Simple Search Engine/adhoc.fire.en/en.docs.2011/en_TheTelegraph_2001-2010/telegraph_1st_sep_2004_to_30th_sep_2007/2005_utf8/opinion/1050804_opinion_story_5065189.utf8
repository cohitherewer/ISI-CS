 AS INSECURE AS BEFORE

 On the eve of another Hiroshima Day, Achin Vanaik exposes the hypocrisy of ?responsible? nuclear powers like the US

 Beyond pain

 August 6 and 9 this year will be the 60th anniversary of the dropping of the nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Groups worldwide will be commemorating this tragic event, hoping to remind governments and peoples that they need to pay tribute to the innocent victims, to make sure that those deaths were not completely in vain. What this means is obvious enough ? we have to work towards global nuclear disarmament. While much of global civil society, and many governments, will listen to and respect this simple message, the nuclear weapons powers and their most obsequious allies will not. What the attitude of the Indian government and that of much of our elite might be to this has now been made fairly clear.

 In the wake of the India-US accord, it is believed in such circles that India has now been accepted as a ?responsible nuclear power?. Accepted by whom? Why, of course, by the United States of America, to whom India is now beholden and which therefore can no longer be criticized for its nuclear behaviour, past and present. 

 The truth is that there is no such thing as a ?responsible nuclear power?. The clique that even the Indian pro-bomb lobby once called the club of nuclear apartheid, whose members were dishonest and hypocritical about nuclear proliferation, is now to be repackaged and sold in this country as the club of ?responsible powers?. All because India is getting de facto entry into it, courtesy the US.

 The truth is that there isn?t and cannot be any such animal as a ?responsible nuclear power?. The key arguments used to justify acquisition of nuclear weapons are all minor variations on the fundamental theme of deterrence, and as such are applicable to a chain of other countries. What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. This is why aspiring or potential nuclear powers, as well as nuclear disarmament proponents, have declared that if existing nuclear powers refuse to move towards disarming themselves then they have no moral right to oppose proliferation or prevent others from acquiring nuclear weapons. Also, every one of the seven declared nuclear powers (the eighth being Israel) have been involved in forms of extra-country linkages tantamount to promoting proliferation ? the US and Canadian support to India?s nuclear power sector from which it developed the 1974 bomb, the Russia-China and US-Britain collaboration of the Fifties, the French-Israel or US-Israel link, the Israel-South Africa link, the China-Pakistan link.

 Of course, among this coterie, the irresponsibility is not equally shared. The US is by far the most irresponsible of the lot. It is the only one to use nuclear weapons on a civilian population and has never seen fit to apologize to the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki though it got an apology from Japan for Pearl Harbour. It has always been the principal pace-setter in the qualitative development of the nuclear arms race. It has carried out the most nuclear tests, spreading deadly radiation among Marshall Islanders as well as amidst the Nevada population. It has spent more money ($5.5 trillion between 1940-96) on its nuclear weapons programme than the rest of the world put together. Its nuclear weapons budget for 2005 is $6.6 billion, which is higher than its yearly average during the Cold War years. 

 The US?s top officials say that high-yield nuclear weapons are self-deterring because their use is more difficult given the public memories of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. And therefore, the US needs to make low-yield and more usable nuclear weapons. This, of course, is what the US is preparing to make. Paul Robinson, chairman of the policy subcommittee of the strategic advisory group for the commanders-in-chief of the US strategic command talks of a ?to whom it may concern? nuclear arsenal directed at third world countries and targets.

 Nor should we forget the current US effort to nuclearize-militarize outer space through its integrated Ballistic Missile Defence and Theatre Missile Defence programme. This is aimed at dominating nuclear rivals like Russia and China and will push them to make more and bigger warheads and delivery systems. This in turn will push India to expand its arsenal to keep pace with say, China, and Pakistan to do the same vis-?-vis India. That the most powerful nuclear country is doing this, thereby guaranteeing future nuclear instability when there already exist enough weapons between itself and Russia to blow up the world several times over, is only a further indication of how insane the search is for nuclear ?security? and power through nuclear weapons. Similarly, India?s silence (or is it endorsement?) over the BMD/TMDs project is a mark of its own cowardice.

 At the level of doctrine, it is of course the US that is systematically blurring the distinction between nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. It is the US that is integrating, at the operational military level, the use of nuclear and non-nuclear conventional weapons; it is the US that now declares its willingness to use military power pre-emptively and preventively, in contempt of all existing international laws and norms. It is the US that refuses to give assurances to non-nuclear states that it will never use nuclear weapons against them. Again, it is the US that will defy the UN convention on the Law of the Seas by reserving for itself the right to interdict any ship it suspects of carrying nuclear-related materials by or for any country which it holds as not being a ?responsible? nuclear or indeed non-nuclear state. Are these expressions of responsible nuclear behaviour?

 One of the most striking things about the nuclear weapons lobbies the world over is how the number of defectors from its side to the anti-nuclear side is many times greater than the opposite flow of one-time nuclear disarmers to pro-bomb lobbies. One such defector is Robert McNamara who said in June this year, ?I would characterize current US nuclear weapons policy as immoral, illegal, military unnecessary and dreadfully dangerous.? 

 But what does he know? Don?t we have it on the word of New Delhi and its media acolytes that the smaller but ?responsible? nuclear power India has now joined hands with the larger but also ?responsible? nuclear power, the US, for the good of India and the world? Mahatma Gandhi, who could not speak for 24 hours after the bombing of Hiroshima, must now be turning in his grave. A-bomb victims ? rest in peace, your Indian and American saviours are at hand.

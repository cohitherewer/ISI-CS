 OPEN INVITATION

 Despite politicians? penchant for doublespeak, it actually helps to be candid in politics. The prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, is known to value transparency in both public policy and politics. It is not surprising therefore that he openly invited Ms Mamata Banerjee not only to return to the Congress but also to join his cabinet. Coming from the prime minister, the offer should put to rest any doubts about the Congress?s keenness to see her back in the party. Other Congress leaders have repeatedly made the same offer to her. There can be no doubt that Mr Singh?s offer has the approval of the Congress president, Ms Sonia Gandhi. The prime minister?s offer must be part of a larger plan that the Congress president has to expand and strengthen the party. Wooing back deserters and dissenters such as Ms Banerjee or Mr Sharad Pawar of the Nationalist Congress Party would be an obvious strategy for the Congress. As the largest national party, the Congress has to have a broader view of politics than the regional parties which respond primarily to local situations.

 Ms Banerjee would have jumped at the offer, but for a problem. Her entire political career has been focussed on fighting Bengal?s ruling Marxists. It cannot be easy for her to join Mr Singh?s minority government that survives on the support of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and other left parties. Nor can she easily walk back to a Congress that has the left as the most crucial ally in national politics. Some could also argue that there was no guarantee that she could humble the left in next year?s assembly elections in Bengal if she returned to the Congress or allied with it. After all, her party, the Trinamool Congress, did fight the 2001 polls in the state in alliance with the Congress and still lost them. All these arguments are valid, but only to a limited extent. The Congress?s electoral potential has changed dramatically since the coming of the United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre. And, despite their new-found camaraderie in New Delhi, the left and the Congress will be major rivals in Bengal, Kerala and Tripura. The Congress?s secular politics makes it her natural party. Her alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party, on the other hand, has alienated large sections of the Muslims from her party. How she responds to Mr Singh?s offer may shape the next stage in her ? and Bengal?s ? politics.

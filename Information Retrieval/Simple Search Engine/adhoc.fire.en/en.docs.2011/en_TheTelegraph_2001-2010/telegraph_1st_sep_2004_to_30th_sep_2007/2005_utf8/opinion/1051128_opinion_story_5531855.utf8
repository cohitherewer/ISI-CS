 THE WOMAN QUESTION

 Not many women came forward to support Kushboo, but Rajashri Dasgupta wonders if the media too should shoulder some blame 

 They also serve

 It?s like a bizarre Victorian drama unfolding. A comment by an actress on pre-marital sex in an interview to a magazine has led to her arrest order, 20 legal cases, mob violence and threats to drive her away from Tamil Nadu. When Kushboo spoke her mind in September ? saying that sex before marriage was alright provided precautions were taken against pregnancy and AIDS and that no educated man could expect his partner to be a virgin ? little did she guess that her opinion would snowball into a violent controversy.

 It is no coincidence that those who have been attacked for supporting Kushboo are public figures, all women. Actress Suhasini Maniratnam was among the first, showing rare courage when many in the film industry remained silent spectators. Both Sania Mirza and Narain Karthikeyan spoke at a function about the controversy. In fact, the Formula-I driver?s words in support of Kushboo were more forthright than Suhasini?s, but Sania Mirza has been hounded since. The political parties spearheading the attacks, the Pattali Makkal Katchi and Dalit Panther, have demanded an apology from Suhasini, failing which they proposed to launch an agitation against her as well. In Andhra Pradesh, both Hindu and Muslim fundamentalists have found common cause: the Muslim clergy issued a veiled threat of excommunicating Sania Mirza for her ?outrageous stand? while the Vishwa Hindu Parishad accused the 19-year-old of bringing shame on Indian society by trying to break down the institution of marriage.

 Second,this kind of culture-policing and mob-censorship has serious implications for the freedom of expression. People ? including women ? have the right to express their opinion on issues which affect their social and professional lives. Women?s World, a network of women writers, had noted in its newsletter that women?s voice is generally greeted with indifference. But those who have tried to have a public voice, have met with hatred, contempt, suppression, exile, even death. As long as Kushboo played the romantic heroine, she remained the darling of the Tamil people, but the tables were turned when she dared to speak out in public on the issue of sex and marriage.

 Clearly, Kushboo has committed no sin or crime. Given the high incidence of HIV/AIDS in the country, the importance of condoms and safe sex cannot be overemphasized. Even the school education system has woken up to this reality and introduced to ?lifestyle education? (a euphemism for sex education) in the curriculum of adolescents. This proposal too met with a great deal of resistance, mostly arising out of the refusal to admit that young adolescents are aware and even curious about the subject of sex.

 The real issue in the Kushboo controversy is not sex before marriage; it is all about control over women. Like the Victorians, Indians to this day lay great store by sexual restraint and moral uprightness in women. They feel that in the absence of a system of control, women?s sexual appetite and powers would be dangerous to society. Hence the attack on women?s speech, somewhat akin to attacks on women?s dress or on their right to choose their husbands. Women have been, and continue to be, killed in the name of protecting the community?s honour. Women have been forced, often with legal help, to conform to dress codes formulated for them by men.

 In the eyes of her attackers, Kushboo, considered to be a genteel, refined woman (as opposed to destitute women, whose ?vulgarity? is taken for granted and excused), has sinned by overstepping the line and speaking about women?s sexuality. Her sins were compounded manifold by the fact that she chose not to chastise those who may have had, or supported, sex before marriage, but to acknowledge that women are not asexual, passive objects, but could be active participants in the sexual act. 

 There is every reason to believe that the backlash against Kushboo is political. It is the fear of women?s growing autonomy that has shaken up the men who play politics in the region and the country. The silence till now, for instance, of the South Indian Film Artistes Association, the rebuke of the chief minister, J. Jayalalithaa, the threats, the whispers and clucking of tongues show exactly what forces push women to comply and punish those who do not conform.

 But the most dangerous manifestation of this is seen in women who internalize the rules and enforce them on themselves and on women around them. The defamation cases filed by the women?s wing of the PMK against Kushboo and the criminal cases initiated by five women advocates bear ample proof of this. Hemmed in on all sides, a tearful Kushboo apologized for her remarks, Sania Mirza issued a ?clarification? and Suhasini tendered a public apology after being showcaused.

 In the entire drama, the media?s role as a collaborator with the forces of repression cannot be denied. These days, journalists are no longer required to present the bare facts. Just as the culture police presented their version of Kushboo?s comment, a section of the media was at hand to help them with sensational headlines, hounding Sania Mirza for quotes, scrounging backstage for fresh scoops, fanning the mob frenzy all the while. Protests by organizations against the unreason of the political activists were either ignored by the media or given a passing mention. Few newspapers mentioned that the All India Democratic Women?s Association had condemned the moral policing, Women?s World felt that the whole campaign was an insult to the teachings of E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker, a brilliant thinker forgotten today in Tamil politics. The Network of Women in Media has urged that any pluralistic society in transformation has to create space for varied views, and conflicting opinions. The media, rather than sensationalizing the issue, must provide the platform for democratic debate, said the network.

 To blame Kushboo for corrupting all Tamil women is to entirely miss the point. The fact that issues like free speech and women?s sexuality can inflame such passions even today indicate that we have a long way to go.

 LETHAL DELAY

 Every year, the seasonal outbreak of malaria in West Bengal, and its aftermath, has a wearying routine. The same sort of medical, municipal and political noises are made with no perceptible effect. The mosquitos breed, bite, die and breed again; the same unpreparedness, warnings, resolutions and popular distress recur and die out. But the garbage and the stagnant water remain for the next season. This time the situation has intensified with an outbreak of something far more dangerous: dengue. The death-toll is nearing ten, and the number of afflicted well above a hundred. Several boroughs within the city, under the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, have been declared dengue-prone. But the official voices are still both defensive and non-committal about the extent to which the situation is ?under control?, although the chief minister has had his meeting of concern. 

 The actual situation a little outside the city is alarming. Specialists had asked the health department for about 500 rapid detection kits for the various government hospitals (especially in the suburbs) which would identify the dengue virus (though not the exact strain) in the blood within twenty minutes. But this has not been done yet. So the essential processes of detection followed by mapping the spread of the disease has not even begun properly. The blood testing process still remains complicated and time-consuming. So help is not reaching people who need it outside the city ? say, in Hooghly or Howrah, where the afflicted cannot risk a long journey to the inner-city hospitals. The spread of the disease outside these areas is even less known, and might be quite extensive. In terms of prevention, a large proportion of fogging machines, which kill mosquitos, remain in a state of disrepair (the usual story with equipment in the health sector, rural as well as urban and suburban). Funds, helpers, cleaners and entomologists have been galvanized into action ? yet not promptly enough. The mayor has had to face popular disgruntlement as well as hindering political opposition. It is the familiar unpreparedness, but with more lethal consequences.

 21ST-CENTURY FOXX

 This weekend the unassuming Jamie can hardly put a foot wrong. Having stepped into the shoes of both Ray Charles and a cabbie, there?s reason enough for him to strut his stuff on Oscar night

RAY 

OF LIGHT

Notes 

on Ray Charles: 

 First to fuse blues, gospel and country to create 

soul music

 Became blind from glaucoma at six, just as he 

was learning to play the piano

 Was inspired by Nat King Cole

 Won 12 Grammies in a 50-year career.

Stand-up comic genius, cantankerous and difficult R amp;B legend, mild-mannered taxi driver ? will the real Jamie Foxx stand up, please? On second thoughts, let the poor man be. Right now, the only time he wants to stand up is when the announcer on the LA stage says: and the Oscar goes to...

 It?s never easy being the toast of the town in the week leading up to the Oscars, with every paparazzo worth his salt chasing your tailcoat, and blogspots raving about your prosthetic eyelids. 

 But then, the actor has the weekend to look forward to. For, going by the euphoria surrounding Foxx?s role, he?s going to walk up the ramp this year: let?s say his fingers are already brushing the golden statuette. 

 So, for now, let?s just stick to Jamie?s performance as Ray Charles in the screen biopic Ray, the movie that fetched him his first Academy Award nomination for best actor. If he finally gets selected, he?ll be the third black man to bag the best actor award at the Oscars ? Sidney Poitier for the 1963 film Lilies of the Field, and Denzel Washington for Training Day three years ago, are the two who?ve led the way before. 

 And just to put things in perspective, let?s check out the four other guys he?s up against. There?s Clint Eastwood, for his role as the reluctant boxing coach in Million Dollar Baby; Leonardo Di Caprio as the high-flying millionaire Howard Hughes in The Aviator; Don Cheadle in the heart-wrenching drama of ethnic strife in Hotel Rwanda and Johnny Depp playing inspired author J.M. Barrie in Finding Neverland. All of them are veterans of Hollywood with years of histrionic experience behind them ? and Foxx is Jamie come lately.

 Yet, this Oscar season, Jamie Foxx is far from running scared. In fact, he can hardly put a foot wrong. Let?s not forget, Foxx also has a nomination for best supporting actor in the edgy thriller Collateral where he plays a cab driver, ferrying assassin Tom Cruise across Los Angeles. He?s only the second actor after Al Pacino to have bagged two Oscar nods for two movies in a single year.

 If the 37-year-old Foxx can finally claim his rightful place under the arc lights, it?s all thanks to Ray. Viewers everywhere have commented on the strikingly life-like performance that Foxx puts in as the great singer. 

 ?He smiled like Ray Charles. He spoke like Ray Charles. He walked like Ray Charles. We were watching Ray Charles,? writes an ecstatic blogger, sharing his impressions on the movie. 

 The actor himself is characteristically modest about his role. ?Ray Charles is the leading actor and I?m the supporting actor, because without his life we wouldn?t have had anything,? he has said. Charles himself approved of the casting of Foxx for the role, but passed away a few months before the release.

 It possibly helped that Foxx got directions from the great man himself in rehearsing for the role, and that didn?t mean just donning Charles? dark glasses. For some portions, he wore prosthetic eyelids which virtually made him blind like the singer himself. 

 He also lost over 30 pounds to fit into the role. Foxx speaks about, ?how he orders his food, how he talks to his woman, how he gets upset. And not the impersonation, but how he really is.? It also helped that Foxx is a decent vocalist ? he has a degree from Julliard School ? with a fair share of talent in playing the piano.

 But then, slipping into the persona of another man comes naturally to Foxx ? after all that?s how he started out, as the gag guy in the comedy variety show Living Color, way back in the early Nineties. But his brush with comedy goes back even further ? to the time when friends goaded him on to the stage on a club night to perform some lively impersonations, much to the delight of the crowd. 

 Foxx willingly followed the trail to LA and after years of dishing out his funny lines on sitcoms, he finally got his break in serious cinema with Oliver Stone?s sports drama Any Given Sunday in 1999. A role in the Will Smith-starrer Ali followed in 2001. And then in 2004, Ray and Collateral happened to Jamie Foxx.

 The best thing is that not even all this adulation has turned the actor?s head. But then, Foxx is still new to the Hollywood hall of fame. He doesn?t mind saying that Charles could be quite caustic if he hit the wrong note on the piano, or that people will watch Collateral to ogle Tom Cruise and not him. ?Whatever you do to him, you can?t make him look ugly,? the star reportedly said about Cruise.

 But all that modesty is really unnecessary when it comes to Ray, and Foxx has done more than enough to repay his due to the great singer. 

 In fact reports even suggest that Charles? last album Genius Loves Company ? which won multiple Grammies this year ? owes much of its success to the movie, which has led to a revival of interest in Charles? gospel-jazz-country fusion.

 And this just seems to be the beginning for Foxx. UK bookmakers have already closed betting for his winning the Oscar this year. ?It?s a case of Foxx first and the rest nowhere,? a spokesman for the firm said. 

 With racy police flick Miami Vice and Gulf-War drama Jarhead, directed by Sam American Beauty Mendes, coming up this year, Foxx is set to go places. And the Bafta and Golden Globe notwithstanding, if he finally gets his first Oscar on Monday, then it will certainly be a night for Jamie Foxx.

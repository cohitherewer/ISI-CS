 A TASK WELL DONE 

 Even a good budget is ultimately as 

 good as its implementation, writes S. Venkitaramanan, and 

 that would depend largely on the states 

 G-7 meeting: ?Look 

 East? 

 P. Chidambaram has produced a 

 budget that has achieved the seemingly ?impossible? task 

 of pleasing the markets as well as his political masters, 

 the members of the motley coalition that is the United Progressive 

 Alliance, while keeping to the vision of the national common 

 minimum programme. He has pressed on with reforms and stressed 

 all the points which his critics have been fearing he would 

 omit ? health, education, water supply, the minorities and, 

 above all, employment. He has, at the same time, succeeded 

 in allaying concerns about fiscal consolidation by producing 

 revenue and fiscal deficit figures that are within his stated 

 aim. This notwithstanding the higher commitments thrust 

 on him by the 12th finance commission and defence capital 

 expenditures.

 The finance minister has delivered 

 a budget with a human face, but still focussed on growth 

 with jobs. He has gently chided his coalition partners about 

 their allergy to foreign direct investment. He has cited 

 his Chinese counterpart as mentioning at the recent G-7 

 meeting at London that China has received upwards of $500 

 billion as FDI in the last decade. ?Look East, angry young 

 men of the Left,? seems to be his unstated message. If India 

 is to be gloriously rich, it has to follow at least this 

 example of Chinese policy.

 The finance minister has adopted 

 the device of a special purpose vehicle to encourage infrastructure 

 investment. This is a variation on Montek Singh Ahluwalia?s 

 idea of using the Reserve Bank of India?s foreign exchange 

 reserves for the purpose. But an SPV is good only if there 

 are projects which will yield reasonable returns on the 

 investments. Pricing policy in power, roads, water and railways 

 have to be radically altered if the financial structure 

 is to yield expected results in the shape of increased investment 

 by public-private partnership.

 An SPV is only a financial innovation. 

 The finance minister will succeed in infrastructure investment 

 only if there are sufficient returns to be secured. This 

 can happen only if the infrastructure providers are able 

 to charge the right prices for their services and are able 

 to operate in a free manner. The managers of the SPV will 

 have to ensure that the provision of infrastructural finance 

 is subject to the conditions on pricing and bidding procedures.

 The budget has reformed customs 

 duty and excise duty structure in the right direction. It 

 has attempted bold changes in the duty structure on petroleum 

 products. Its reforms on direct taxes have been welcomed. 

 Particularly, its thrust in the area of savings is a desirable 

 one. The depths of its modification of the corporate tax 

 structure have to be seen before one pronounces judgment.

 The budget includes a scheme for 

 gold units, which will be traded in the markets, like mutual 

 funds. This is an idea which has been around a long time. 

 Chidambaram has given it a positive and workmanlike shape. 

 If successful, it will help reduce the Indian fascination 

 for the yellow metal, which involves large expenditure on 

 foreign exchange. Ultimately, even with as good a budget 

 statement as Chidambaram?s latest, one has to concede that 

 a budget is only as good as its implementation. The report 

 card of the government on the July 2004 budget is a promising 

 indication of better performance in the years to come. But, 

 the pressure on compliance on the state governments to implement 

 the various schemes has to continue unabated if the budget 

 is to implement the vision of Manmohan Singh and Chidambaram.

 On the whole, the budget is a 

 good statement. It is, however, to be seen whether its implementation 

 will be as good as promised. The finance minister has mentioned 

 that so far what he promised in July 2004 is on track. Ultimately, 

 the implementation is at the state level mostly. With the 

 finance commission?s recommendations, one is not clear whether 

 the Centre has as much leverage as before with the states.

 The finance minister has promised 

 some reforms in the banking sector. He has also set his 

 vision on making Mumbai a financial centre for the world. 

 This would, however, demand a bolder move towards capital 

 account convertibility and exchange rate flexibility. I 

 am sure that the visionary that he is, the finance minister 

 will be ready for both.

 The markets have welcomed the 

 budget. Whether the honeymoon will last for more than the 

 first day?s response remains to be seen. The devil is in 

 the fine print and I hope the markets will be as comfortable 

 with the budget as the masses are expected to be.

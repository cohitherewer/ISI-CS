 GIRLS FOR LESS

 Perhaps the girls will get to live if they cost less. This is the sort of logic ? brutal, but undeniable ? that the Centre addresses through the human resource development ministry?s latest set of measures. Girls who are the only child of their parents will get free education in all Central board schools between classes VI and XII. This is presumably to prevent female foeticide, a practice that remains distressingly prevalent, particularly among the urban middle classes. But female foeticide is an extreme manifestation of a profound and ubiquitous form of inequality and injustice that is perhaps Indian society?s gravest offence against humanity and modernity. The Centre?s decision will certainly make a difference among the classes that send their children to school, and to the schools which fall within the purview of the Centre?s measures. But what about the rest, especially when the major section of this other lot would be India?s poorest of the poor, among whom the ?costs? of the female child must provoke a different order of terror, and therefore violence?

 Besides, the Centre seems to have confounded the redressal of gender injustice with population control by differentiating between an only girl and one with a female or male sibling. The latter?s concessions are halved. This might look like punishing the innocent. Moreover, by deciding not to subsidize the Central schools after such fee-cuts, the Centre might end up encouraging schools to not take in girls, since they would prove to be less lucrative than the boys. The rationale that these schools do, in any case, take in very few girls, and therefore would remain relatively unaffected by this measure, is baffling, since it is precisely this low number of female students which the Centre is trying to deal with and improve. The entire matter requires harder thinking and planning. Are these measures targeting the poor or the middle classes? What sort of schools ? in terms of their own financial resources and that of their catchment area ? would be implementing these measures? Besides, what do the schools under the other boards do? Would these measures affect the quality of education imparted by the Central schools, and what if this ends up creating yet another gendered hierarchy within the schools ? the fee-paying boys and the non-fee-paying girls ? that would reinforce the very inequalities which the Centre is trying to combat?

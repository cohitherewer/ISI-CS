 HUNTING

 TO THE

 GROUND

 Camilla Parker Bowles has waited for 35 years to marry Prince Charles. But neither the Queen nor the populace is amused by her tenacity

 In the 24 years that have lapsed between the 1981 marriage of the Prince of Wales and the 19-year-old Lady Diana Spencer and today, when Charles, now 56, goes to the Guildhall in Windsor for a civil ceremony in which 57-year-old Camilla Parker Bowles, ?e Shand, becomes his second wife, there has been a virtual social revolution in Britain. 

 Back in 1981, England put on a royal show as only England can to dazzle the world. Millions turned out for street parties across the length and breadth of the kingdom in a genuine display of national rejoicing. Outside Buckingham Palace, the huge crowds, who came for the first public balcony kiss between Charles and Diana, must have matched the massive turnout for VE Day when the Second World War ended with Allied Victory against Nazi Germany.

 The best that Charles and Camilla can hope for, as they marry at a furtive ceremony marred by the absence of a disapproving Queen, is that in another quarter of a century, today?s hostility will give way to a public willingness to accept a Queen Camilla. To be sure, the couple have said that Camilla has no wish to be Queen, that she will call herself the Duchess of Cornwall for the time being and that when Charles succeeds to the throne when the Queen dies ? and the Queen Mother (like Nirad C. Chaudhuri) lived till 102 ? she will be content with the title of Princess Consort.

 What is significant is that despite calls by some MPs, Parliament has so far not passed legislation preventing Camilla from becoming Queen. According to a 1936 law, the King?s spouse automatically becomes Queen.

 Sooner rather than later, Charles and Camilla will come to India, a country for which he has acquired more than a soft spot from his late great-uncle, Lord Mountbatten, the last Viceroy of India. Charles is a familiar figure in Indian circles in London and in the last couple of years, Camilla, too, has started meeting socialite Indian women who have found her quite an engaging person with an open laugh.

 In normal circumstances, few people would hold anything against Camilla. Her tragedy is that she follows Diana, who called her a ?Rotweiller?. This reference to her tenacity seems apt because Camilla, who was Charles?s girlfriend before he met Diana, has got her man.

 Camilla?s background is not so different from that of Diana, though perhaps a little more modest. She was born on July 17, 1947, in London, the daughter of Bruce and Rosalind Shand (her brother Mark, who will attend today?s wedding, is well known among the elephant fraternity in Assam) and the granddaughter of the third Baron of Ashcombe. She grew up in rural Sussex, a pretty part of Britain, after going to the Queens Gate School in Kensington in London and finishing schools in Switzerland and France. Unlike Diana, she likes hunting and horses. In fact, in a recent book, The Insider, by former Daily Mirror editor Piers Mirror, there is a revealing account of a lunch he has with Diana at Kensington Palace. Prince William, who is also there, refers to a TV comedy programme called Have I Got News for You?

 ?Oh, Mummy, it was hilarious,? laughed William. ?They had a photo of Mrs Parker Bowles and a horse?s head and asked what the difference was. The answer was that there isn?t any.?

 ?Diana absolutely explodes with laughter,? adds Morgan?s diary entry. Another entry, after Charles and Diana have divorced in 1996, notes that as Charles throws a 50th birthday party for Camilla, Diana makes it a point to pose in a skimpy leopard skin swimsuit in St Tropez to capture the page one spot.

 From everything one can gather, Charles and Camilla have always had great sex, while the relationship with Diana was one of the prince doing his duty and ensuring his wife produced ?an heir (William) and a spare (Harry)?. It has even been whispered because of a superficial resemblance that Harry?s biological father is James Hewitt, one of the many lovers (including Pakistani surgeon Hasnat Khan) Diana took when her marriage collapsed. Charles could have helped himself to a succession of 21-year-old page three girls but he has stuck with Camilla, who is held responsible for the breakup of his marriage.

 In one of his telephone conversations with Camilla, which was somehow bugged, Charles said he loved her so much that he dreamed of being her tampon. Greater passion hath no prince of the realm that he is inspired enough to compare himself with a sanitary towel.

 Charles and Camilla met in 1970 at a polo match in Windsor (not far from where they will marry). She famously said: ?My great-grandmother and your great-great grandfather were lovers. So how about it??

 Within days, they had become lovers. Then Charles went to sea, and in 1973 Camilla married an army officer, Andrew Parker Bowles, who later held the quaint title of Silver Stick-in-Waiting to the Queen. Camilla was instrumental in offering Diana to Charles, who, on his honeymoon, took cufflinks engraved with an entwined C-C (Charles Camilla). Camilla and her husband divorced in 1995, but their children, Tom and Laura, born in 1974 and 1979, will be at the wedding today (as will William and Harry).

 Among those who know, the consensus is that Camilla may not possess Diana?s looks but sexually Charles finds her totally uninhibited. This is a marriage made in bed. The author Jilly Cooper, who has written many a bonkbuster and knows Charles and Camilla well, sums it up: ?Charles finds her very exciting. They look very happy in each other?s company. Obviously, there is a very strong sexual pull.?

 DROP THE IDEA

 Beating a retreat may be the best option in some situations. Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee found himself in one such imbroglio with the pre-litigation conciliation board bill. Given the strong resistance that the bill elicited among all major opposition parties, he has done the right thing in dropping the idea. The ruling Left Front has a large enough majority in the state assembly that would have enabled him to force the passage of the bill. But that course would not have won him the argument for the law. In a democracy, the government cannot afford to do without the opposition?s point of view. More important, a conflict with the dissenters may have made it difficult for the government to implement the law. This is not to deny that the bill had its merit. Since the courts are burdened with cases that pile up for years, there is a need for an alternative system that would stop this denial of justice to the common people. That is what the proposed law, better known as the shalishi bill, promised to give to the people in the villages and small towns. But the opposition?s fears that the local overlords of the ruling parties would reduce this judicial experiment to a partisan farce are not without a basis. It is no secret that the Marxists? writ, rather than the law, runs in Bengal?s far corners. 

 It is possible, though, that the chief minister?s decision not to go ahead with the bill is part of a larger political strategy. With the next assembly elections less than a year away, he did not perhaps want to hand the opposition an issue that could have dented the left?s rural vote-bank. But the overtly political debates over the bill have clouded its legal and administrative aspects. It is time for governments ? at the Centre and in the states ? to try and clean up the huge mess created by long and complicated judicial procedures. It is not enough to mouth the clich? about justice delayed being justice denied. A non-performing system eventually erodes the people?s faith in it. Even the Union law minister, Mr H.R. Bharadwaj, agrees with the idea of an alternative system that makes justice speedy and affordable for the common people. He could take the initiative to build a nationwide political consensus on the issue.

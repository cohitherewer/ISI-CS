 GOOD FENCES

 The government and the people rarely see a problem in the same light. The fencing of the India-Bangladesh border shows the divide rather dramatically. To New Delhi, it is a matter of the nation?s security; to the people living on the borders, it is a question of their homes and livelihoods. The Union minister for the department of northeastern region, Mr P.R. Kyndiah, has correctly captured these people?s sentiments. They are alarmed that the fencing will take away from them vast tracts of their cultivable land. Mr Kyndiah expressed the fears of people living on the borders in Meghalaya. But much the same protests were heard in the recent past in other states where the fence had come up. In West Bengal, the Forward Bloc, a partner in the ruling Left Front, had launched a campaign against the fencing on precisely the same grounds. There is another interesting angle to the people?s complaints. While they resent the loss of their land, they are not convinced that the gains are what the government would like them to believe. The fencing may give them some sense of security against offenders from across the border; but a corrupt and inefficient border management system may continue to be the people?s real problem. 

 However, for all the problems it creates for the people, the fencing of the border is unavoidable. India has not thought of fencing its long borders with China or Nepal. The barrier is coming up on the country?s borders with Pakistan and Bangladesh. Obviously, military and political issues have dictated the need for the measure. The fencing on the eastern border is aimed at checking the illegal migration of Bangladeshis into India. Dhaka has not only resented the move but has also tried to use force sometimes to stop it. At the diplomatic level, the problem is compounded by its persistent refusal to seriously discuss New Delhi?s concern over it. Even those who are worried over the loss of agricultural land due to the fencing see its importance for national security. New Delhi has to think as to how best it can match the security obligations with the people?s interests. One way to do it is to ensure that the people continue to have access to their land even after the fencing is erected. This would require both sensitivity and efficiency on the part of the Border Security Force. It is pointless to have a system that protects the borders but alienates the people.

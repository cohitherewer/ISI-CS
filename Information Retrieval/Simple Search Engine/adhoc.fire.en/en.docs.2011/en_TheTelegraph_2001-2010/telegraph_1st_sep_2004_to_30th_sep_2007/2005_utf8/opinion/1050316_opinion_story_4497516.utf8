 Extracts from the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, May 2003

 The objective of this Convention and its protocols is to protect present and future generations from the devastating health, social, environmental and economic consequences of tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke by providing a framework for tobacco control measures to be implemented by the Parties at the national, regional and international levels in order to reduce continually and substantially the prevalence of tobacco use and exposure to tobacco smoke.

 To achieve the objective of the Convention and its protocols and to implement its provisions, the Parties shall be guided, inter alia, by the principles set out below: 

 1. Every person should be informed of the health consequences, addictive nature and mortal threat posed by tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke and effective legislative, executive, administrative or other measures should be contemplated at the appropriate governmental level to protect all persons from exposure to tobacco smoke. 

 2. Strong political commitment is necessary to develop and support... comprehensive multi-sectoral measures and coordinated responses, taking into consideration: a. the need to take measures to protect all persons from exposure to tobacco smoke; b. the need to take measures to prevent the initiation, to promote and support cessation, and to decrease the consumption of tobacco products in any form; c. the need to take measures to promote the participation of indigenous individuals and communities in the development, implementation and evaluation of tobacco control programmes that are socially and culturally appropriate to their needs and perspectives; and d. the need to take measures to address gender-specific risks when developing tobacco control strategies.

 3. International cooperation, particularly, transfer of technology, knowledge and financial assistance and provision of related expertise, to establish and implement effective tobacco control programmes, taking into consideration local culture as well as social, economic, political and legal factors, is an important part of the Convention.

 4. Comprehensive multi-sectoral measures to reduce consumption of all tobacco products .... are essential so as to prevent... the incidence of diseases, premature disability and mortality due to tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke.

 5. Issues relating to liability, as determined by each Party within its jurisdiction, are an important part of comprehensive tobacco control.

 6. The importance of technical and financial assistance to aid the economic transition of tobacco-growers and workers whose livelihoods are endangered as a consequence of tobacco control programmes in developing country Parties, as well as Parties with economies in transition, should be recognized and addressed in the context of nationally developed strategies for sustainable development.

 7. The participation of civil society is essential in achieving the objective of the Convention and its protocols.

 ... Price and tax measures to reduce the demand for tobacco. 1. The Parties recognize that price and tax measures are an effective and important means of reducing tobacco consumption by various segments of the population, in particular young persons. 

 2. Without prejudice to the sovereign right of the Parties to determine and establish their taxation policies, each Party should take account of its national health objectives concerning tobacco control and adopt or maintain, as appropriate, measures which may include: a. implementing tax policies, and where appropriate, price policies on tobacco products so as to contribute to the health objectives aimed at reducing tobacco consumption; b. prohibiting or restricting, as appropriate, sales to and/or importations by international travellers of tax-and duty free-tobacco products...

 A CLOSET FULL OF CRIMES

 Gwynne Dyer

 If they had taken Adolf Hitler alive in 1945, they would certainly have put him on trial. But what if they had ignored Hitler?s responsibility for starting World War II and his murder of six million Jews, and simply put him on trial for torturing and executing a couple of hundred people whom he suspected of involvement in the July 1944 plot to kill him? You would find that bizarre, would you not?

 Well, Saddam Hussein?s trial started on October19, and that was the sort of charge chosen by the Iraqi government and its American supervisors. After only three hours the trial was adjourned until November 28, mainly because most of the witnesses were too frightened to show up, but by then the prosecution strategy was clear.

 The former Iraqi dictator was not being tried for invading Iran in 1980 and causing hundreds of thousands of deaths, nor for using poison gas on Iranian troops and on rebellious Kurds in Iraq itself (notably at Halabja in 1988, when about 5,000 Iraqi Kurdish civilians died). He was facing trial for invading Kuwait, and not for slaughtering thousands of Iraqi Shias in the course of putting down the revolt that followed his defeat in that war.

 Hand in glove

 He was only being tried for the deaths of 143 people from the Shia town of Dujail, after an assassination attempt on him during a visit to that town. It was a peculiar choice, and the explanation offered by one of the five judges on the Iraqi special tribunal ? ?The Dujail case is the easiest to put together as far as evidence-gathering and preparation is concerned, [because] there are documents that have been seized and verified concerning the case? ? doesn?t hold water.

 The real problem is that the US was closely allied to Saddam during the Eighties, when he was committing atrocities against Iranians and Kurds. At that time, the Reagan administration saw the revolutionary regime of Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran as a far greater threat to US interests, and when Saddam?s war against Iran started going badly it stepped in to save him.

 It was US intelligence photos from spy satellites and reconnaissance aircraft that provided the information about Iranian positions, and US air-force photo interpreters seconded to Baghdad who drew Saddam the detailed maps of Iranian trenches that let him drench them in poison gas. It was the Reagan administration that stopped Congress from condemning Saddam?s use of poison gas, and encouraged American firms and NATO allies to sell him the chemical feedstocks plus a wide variety of other weapons.

 Under the carpet

 It was the US state department that tried to protect Saddam when he gassed his own Kurdish citizens in Halabja, spreading stories (which it knew to be false) that Iranian planes had dropped the gas. It was the US which finally saved Saddam?s regime by providing escorts for tankers carrying oil from Gulf states while Iraqi planes were left free to attack tankers coming from Iranian ports. So the US doesn?t want any of Saddam?s crimes that are connected with the Iran war to come up in his trial. 

 Dujail, on the other hand, raises no awkward questions, so Saddam will be tried on that charge first. It is unlikely that he will ever face other charges, for the death penalty was reintroduced in Iraq last year. And once Saddam has been condemned to death for the Dujail killings he will not live long. 

 Saddam could easily be convicted on the Dujail charge, exhaust his appeals, and be hanged by early next year. Iraq?s Shias and Kurds will celebrate his death, but its Sunni Arabs ? and a great many people elsewhere in the Arab world ? will see him as a martyr to the Arab nationalist cause. He is nothing of the sort, but the hypocrisy of this trial is revolting.

 LAW AND CUSTOM

 Traditional societies have their unique ways of adapting to modern forms of government. In many places in India?s North-east, tribal societies continue to grapple with changes brought about by democratic institutions. It could be interesting, therefore, to watch how the tribals in Jharkhand take to the panchayati raj. The fact that several tribal organizations have voiced their reservations about the first-ever panchayat polls in the state points to the community?s dilemma. At the heart of the issue is the divide between law and custom. And the divide becomes sharper as democratic institutions reach out to villages. No doubt that the modern system will eventually prevail. This would be so not necessarily because of its moral superiority over the traditional system, but because it carries with it many political and economic benefits. The development funds that are placed at the panchayats? disposal make it the prime agent of transformation of rural economies. The political process that enters village societies through the elections introduces far-reaching changes. Despite all this, it is not difficult to understand why the tribal organizations in Jharkhand are anxious to retain some of their traditional customs. They definitely have a case. 

 For Jharkhand?s chief minister, Mr Arjun Munda, the panchayat polls pose a different challenge. He has to ensure that the polls do not drive a wedge between the tribals and the non-tribal communities. Since its creation as a separate state, Jharkhand has witnessed a simmering tension over the issue. The domicile and the job reservation policies of the government have added to the tension. Mr Munda, therefore, would have to deal firmly with politicians or other activists who might abuse the panchayat polls in order to incite communal or ethnic passions. Also, the state must abide by the constitutional provision for the reservation of seats for women. Jharkhand?s first experiment with grassroots democracy could go waste if women are denied their place in it.

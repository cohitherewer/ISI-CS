 BIG CITY, BRIGHT LIGHTS

 The Delhi that No-one Knows

 By R.V. Smith, 

 Chronicle, Rs 350

 Narayani Gupta writes in her foreword to The Delhi that No-one Knows that during the last three decades in Delhi, ?the population increased steadily, the skyline soared upwards, and the city?s history seemed to sink under the weight of the metropolis.? R.V. Smith?s book is an attempt to revive the city which has slipped into relative oblivion under the pressure of the political and economic life of the bustling metropolis.

 Smith, whose family has been in India since the 19th century, has long been a Delhi-enthusiast. He wrote his first article on Delhi?s unsung landmarks in 1958, when he was still new to the city. He has written extensively on the subject. This book tries to collate that effort.

 The Delhi is divided into four broad sections ? ?South Delhi?, ?Shahjahanabad?, ?Lal Qila? and ?Beyond the City Walls?. Smith writes in a fashion that lends the feel of a walk. The individual articles are footnoted with the locational details. In case somebody does not follow the local language, there is a glossary of Urdu and Hindi words.

 However, the scope of the text has not been reflected in the quality of the finished book. The Delhi that No-one Knows is informative and engrossing at times. But what it achieves is, at best, a shadow of what it could have achieved. And among its problems are an uneven writing style and bad editing.

 For instance, while describing the ?Chhatanki of Bhim?, a huge stone that lies about a mile away from the Qutb, Smith first describes the myth surrounding it and what a chhatanki means. After which he starts surmising in a na?ve fashion Bhimsen?s relation with the rock, ?One wonders what Bhim did with this stone. Could it have been used for weightlifting by him or was it the measure by which he had his daily meals? ...could it be that in a fit of anger he threw it so far away (from his capital)??

 As an example of bad editing consider this: ?The dream unfolded the origin of the tornado as the pent-up anger of not only the saint but also that of his equally holy relatives who are buried near the old Subzimandi.? Not to mention the missing or misplaced commas throughout the book.

 If fact and conjecture is seamlessly sewed together, it hampers the factual authority of a book instead of augmenting it. Of course, if the book does not pretend to be authoritative, that takes care of this particular uneasiness. But then, what shelf in the bookstore should be assigned to this book?

 The genre that would fit the perspective of Smith?s work is the coffee-table book. In which case, the book could be blamed for its lack of visuals. It has four badly done sketches of Delhi?s monuments, four unfathomable road maps point out the monuments without mentioning the names of roads. Photographs or good drawings could have improved the book. But it chooses to leave that work for the reader?s imagination.

 In the author?s note Smith claims, ?I did not refer to any book, did not make notes from dusty volumes in old libraries ? I just walked.? The claim is not altogether true, since he refers to a few historians. But the question is, is that a good method to follow while writing a book. The Delhi lacks the rigours of history, yet continues to linger on the edges of the subject. 

 The book is 145-pages long and is printed on one-sixteenth crown paper. Which raises questions about its pricing. A trifle steep, isn?t it?

 IN A LOWER CLASS

 Since its tryst with destiny, India has not been too good at keeping dates. It is very unlikely that it will be able to meet its target of universal elementary education by 2010, a date it set itself. There is no comfort in the hope that even without having gone to middle school, everyone will have gone to primary school. The UNESCO?s global monitoring report on the Education for All scheme includes India in the list of countries that will not have even halved their adult illiteracy levels by 2015, nor achieved universal primary education. This is a blow to the high-profile Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan instituted by the government in 2002 with the target of elementary education for all.

 It is not merely the question of spread that is worrying. The questions being raised about gender parity and the quality of instruction do not elicit hopeful answers either. A citizens? audit by a number of non-government organizations will be conducted across a wide swathe of villages to check the actual achievements of children in primary and secondary levels. The initial observations of children in the 7-10 age group have turned up alarming results in all basic skills: reading, writing, spelling and arithmetic. Perhaps the most significant part of the enquiry would be into teacher-student ratios, availability of textbooks, number of classrooms and use of teaching tools. There is something mysteriously wrong with the government?s attitude to basic education. There is a scarcity of teachers, and a large number of those who do teach are not suitably qualified. This is particularly true of states like West Bengal, in which vested political interests in appointment have undermined education from the primary level upwards. There is also the old story about the diversion of funds meant for building up school infrastructure. Yet there have been no dearth of reports by specialist institutions and non-governmental organizations over the years, long before the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan came into being, pointing repeatedly to the same flaws. That the flaws are never addressed ? except through outbursts of pious intentions and crops of programmes ? suggests a strange lack of commitment on the part of the government. This will leave India, long after its independence, one of 12 countries housing three-quarters of the illiterate people of the world, and specifically with one of the lowest regional literacy rates.

 A world of high technology and intensive information requires literacy for survival. To not enable its citizens to live a full life, or even a safe and protected one, is the greatest failure for a democracy. Economic growth cannot be an abstraction shorn of human resources and potential, nor can there be a market without people. The warnings have been many and grave. India really cannot afford to miss any more dates with itself.

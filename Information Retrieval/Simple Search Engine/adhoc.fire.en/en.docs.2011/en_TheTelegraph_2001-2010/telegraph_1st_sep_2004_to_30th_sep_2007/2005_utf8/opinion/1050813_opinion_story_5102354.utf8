 Letters to Editor

 Where fortune smiles

 Sir ? If you want to know what the future holds for you, you should take a stroll down the lane between the two gardens of Curzon Park, now renamed Bhasha Udyan. The street is manned by two parrot card readers at both its ends, with a saffron-clad jyotishi and an umbrella-wielding palmist in the middle. To keep up with the advances in technology, there is even a twinkling robot, which forecasts through a pair of headphones. If you want something more mystic, then there is a tantrik too. Shouldn?t the mayor consider renaming the thoroughfare Fortune Street?

 Yours faithfully,

 Sandeep Sethi, Calcutta

 Loss of face, again

 Sir ? Everyone knows how the media have handled cricket in India. Why don?t they have the guts to admit that the Sri Lankans are far superior to the Indians, and it was not by fluke that they defeated us in the tri-series finals? Other than Rahul Dravid, none of the Indian batsmen batted as if he was playing in an international match. The Telegraph might try its best to promote and protect the Sourav Ganguly-Jagmohan Dalmiya duo, but that is not going to save Indian cricket. Dravid is the only person who gives to Indian cricket as selflessly as Kapil Dev once did. The quicker Ganguly is removed from the Indian scene, the better it will be for Indian sports as a whole. Had Ganguly been really outstanding, surely he would have found a place among the Asian XV for the one-dayers against Africa?

 Yours faithfully,

V.S. Giri, Calcutta

 Sir ? The way India has played in Sri Lanka indicates that several of its senior members are either physically unfit, injured, out of form or indifferent to the fact that they represent the country. They have been performing below par for some time, but it was assumed that too much cricket round the year was responsible for this. It was expected that with some rest and training under the new coach, their performance would look up. But our expectations were misplaced. Now the team has to get ready for another tri-series in Zimbabwe. Why cannot some promising youngsters from the India A team be selected in place of the out-of-form seniors? The seniors can be recalled whenever experienced players are needed.

 Yours faithfully,

K.B. Goswami, Calcutta

 Sir ? Fighting spirit and killer instinct cannot be instilled in people in coaching schools ? it has to be cultivated by the individuals. The Indian team lost the mental game much before they lost the match at the Premadasa stadium on August 9. I feel sorry for Rahul Dravid, who did everything he could as a batsman and as captain ? but his teammates seemed to have other plans. The Indians, who went from 200 for 2 to 260 for 9 in a few overs, could give Michael Schumacher a run for his money. The biggest problem of the Indians is that they choke at crucial points. One does not need a sports psychologist to correct this. The players themselves can do it, with some willpower.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The Sri Lanka series being over,the captaincy issue is now the focal point of debate. The media, as usual, including The Telegraph, is trying to engineer a rift between Rahul Dravid and Sourav Ganguly. But the matter must be discussed, rising above parochial considerations. If it were not for the ban imposed on him, Ganguly would not have been stripped of his captaincy. So, maybe he should get it back without any voting or debate. He has also been among runs in Sri Lanka.

 But both Ganguly and Dravid are indispensable to the team. Ultimately, what is more important than the captaincy issue is that there is no misunderstanding between the two.

 Yours faithfully,

A. Ray Chaudhuri, Asansol

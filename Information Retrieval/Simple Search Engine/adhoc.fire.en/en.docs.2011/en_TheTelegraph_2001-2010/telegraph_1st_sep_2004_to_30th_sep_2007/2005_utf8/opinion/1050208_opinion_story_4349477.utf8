 ANOTHER WAY

 Violence is coldly logical: its logic lies athwart all other forms of intervention. That has not discouraged the Union home minister, Mr Shivraj Patil, from suggesting that there should be no deaths from proxy encounters and that extremists should be persuaded to talk to the state. The irony of his remarks was underlined by an encounter between the police and Naxalites near Chikmagalur in Karnataka on the same day. The Karnataka government has been trying to open a conversation with the People?s War Group militants since last September. Naxalites have spread into areas of Karnataka from Andhra Pradesh, where talks between them and the state broke down last month, resulting in fresh bloodshed. 

 Mr Patil?s reference to proxy encounters has a very obvious double edge, since it hints at the fake encounters set up by the police. This, together with the clear signals from the Centre and from Mr Patil himself, that extremist violence should be treated as a socio-economic rather than purely a law and order problem, suggests a constructive approach to extremist violence, especially so in the context of election-day killings in Jharkhand and Bihar, the bloodshed in Karnataka and the foiled talks in Andhra Pradesh. What is implicit in Mr Patil?s remarks is the responsibility of the police in adding to the blood spilt. Counter-insurgency measures cannot be non-violent, but it is easy to claim victories by stepping slightly out of line. The affected states, though, might feel that Mr Patil is being utopian. Arming the Karnataka Special Task Force, created to catch the now-dead Veerappan, to deal with the PWG, could be a good use of resources, but the STF did not always use legitimate means to interrogate suspected helpers of Veerappan. Legitimacy is an illusion in the midst of terror and sudden death in the forests and hills. A scaling-down of violence would depend on the extremists, but an appearance of fairness from the police might help.

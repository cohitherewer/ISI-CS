 ON THE OFFSIDE

 Subhas Bhowmick, the East Bengal coach arrested on charges of taking bribes from a businessman, was a football icon who courted controversy

 The teenager looks possessed as he races down the field with the ball, a squad of players chasing him. The goalposts get closer and the footballer dodges past the last defender. The crowd erupts in cheers as the flying ball hits the net. The 16-year-old is euphoric. He has scored a winner for his team. But more than that, he has avenged his fathers humiliation ? once an ace footballer whose career was cut short with false charges of bribery.

 Sounds like a scene out of a film? Yes, it is. But, as it turns out, the Bengali film Striker ? released in the late Seventies ? has an ironical sub-text. The booted foot shown kicking the ball into the net in the film was that of Subhas Bhowmick, the East Bengal coach caught pocketing wads of cash outside a Calcutta club on December 2.

 It bothers Moti Nandy, the author of Striker, that the director ? who picked Bhowmick for the kick to infuse realism into the shot ? considered him worthy enough to portray the role of an honest footballer. But the 75-year-old writer and former sports journalist acknowledges that Bhowmick was one of his favourite players.

 Indeed, the fact that he was handpicked for the film speaks of his skills as a footballer. Nimble and agile, he ruled the Calcutta Maidan through the Seventies, playing and scoring for the biggies, including East Bengal, the club he returned to as a coach in 2001.

 Bhowmicks arrest, however, has little to do with football. The coach, a central excise superintendent, was arrested on charges of taking bribes from a businessman whose house Bhowmick had earlier raided. Bhowmick is also accused of having assets disproportionate to his income. But then, the man is no stranger to controversy. If anything, he seemed to court trouble ? on and off the field. Santosh Bhattacharya, East Bengal football secretary, says Bhowmick had been repeatedly warned to mind his unruly tongue. Not long ago, he earned the ire of East Bengal supporters by pointing his shoe at a fan.

 But club officials largely shrugged his actions off as an inevitable trade-off for keeping a highly successful coach in the club. After all, as club executive committee member Debabrata Sarkar says, it was Bhowmick who helped the team achieve its dream of bagging the ASEAN Cup in 2003. Not surprisingly, an influential section of the club kept him on as coach despite the teams repeated defeats over the last year. It was only earlier this week, when news of the graft hit the headlines, that the club announced his intention to quit.

 While many find his off-field aggressiveness offensive, this particular streak has carried this burly man, now in his mid-50s, through on field. It was on display when he tackled as a footballer; and it was on display when East Bengal emerged as the national league champion in 2002 and 2003.

 Indian Football Association (IFA) secretary Subrata Dutta feels Bhowmick is to football what Kishore Kumar was to music ? someone who simply refuses to go by the book. Clearly, for a section of football fans, Bhowmick is something of a legend. There are stories galore about Bhowmickda, as he is fondly called. When footballer Debjit Ghoshs daughter was severely ill a year ago, Bhowmick arranged for a doctor. When another players child died two years ago, he spent the night with him in a city hospital.

 The list is a long one. When East Bengal player Alvita DCunha gained weight, he kept him in his own flat for a week and helped him reduce. And Surajit Sengupta, a former star player, recalls how Bhowmick had helped him through a bad phase in his career.

 Dutta says he was surprised when Bhowmick, despite a spat with him, strongly recommended him to the president of a prestigious city club where he had applied for membership. But then, he has always had the interests of players in mind, explains Swapan Ball, the Kingfisher East Bengal team manager. He points out that it was at his insistence that a gym and a jacuzzi were installed in the club for players. He has always insisted that players be put up in five-star hotels, he says.

 But while there are people who see him as a demi-god, Bhowmick has his share of detractors. Nandy, for one, says Bhowmick has always treated people like dirt. His story, he holds, is a classic example of pride coming before a fall.

 How hard Bhowmick will fall, though, is anybodys guess. For whether he will emerge as the hero of Striker, or as a villain, is something that time ? and the court ? will tell.

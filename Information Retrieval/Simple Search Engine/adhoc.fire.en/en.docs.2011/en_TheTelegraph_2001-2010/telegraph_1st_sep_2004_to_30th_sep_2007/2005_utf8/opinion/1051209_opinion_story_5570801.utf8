 Paperback Pickings

 Love, behind the screen

 Love?s rite: Same-sex Marriage 

 in India and the West (Penguin, Rs 295) by 

 Ruth Vanita provides interesting insights into the complex 

 relationship between the state, marriage and homosexual 

 love. Is social consent necessary for the validation of 

 gay marriages? Or for that matter, is the nature of their 

 sexuality relevant to discussions regarding such unions?Vanita 

 weaves in such important questions even as she tries to 

 locate same-sex love as an intrinsic part of India?s cultural 

 milieux with the help of agencies such as cinema, social 

 customs, folk tradition and anecdotes from history. Contemporary 

 issues such as the discrimination, resistance and violence 

 faced by gays and lesbians in modern India have also been 

 dwelt upon. The debate surrounding homosexuality cannot 

 be swept under the carpet. Vanita?s book reminds us that 

 the task of rescuing homosexuals from the fringes of society 

 perhaps lies not in resistance but through the path of dialogue 

 with the dissenters.

 The final option (Frogbooks, 

 Rs 200) by Baqir Shameem reads like a project 

 which was ghost written by Bollywood?s J.P. Dutt. A joint 

 operation with Americans helps the Pakistanis nab bin Laden 

 while the poor man is asleep.The Pakistanis, in very filmi 

 style, then demand their pound of flesh ? covert American 

 help to grab Kashmir. For what happens next, the reader 

 has to perform the arduous task of leafing through the pages 

 of this book whose first few chapters would bring a smile 

 on Musharraf?s face.

 Scarless face amp; other stories 

 (HarperCollins, Rs 295) edited by Griffin 

 Ondaatje is a collection of tales that ostensibly ?celebrates 

 centuries-old tradition of storytelling?. Animal Kings, 

 flying elephants, monks, thieves and gods jostle for space 

 within the pages that are bound to delight children with 

 their simple charm, wit and flashes of humour. However, 

 Ondaatje?s selection leaves a lot to be desired though. 

 In ?Mouthful of Pearls?, a woman chops off one of her hands 

 and eyes to ward off the advances of a depraved man. Now 

 that?s one apple which can spoil the entire basket.

 New Life (IndiaInk, 

 Rs 295) by Sharmistha Mohanty according to the 

 noted scholar, U.R. Ananthamurthy, ?is not just a tale, 

 it is a poem?. The story of Anjali, her childhood, love 

 and spiritual awakening comprises some beautifully written 

 prose and is interspersed with metaphorical descriptions 

 ? ?Many hours later the darkness began to clear, but so 

 slowly that it took hours to turn into light. When it came, 

 the sunlight was pure and clear and golden. It fell on the 

 rows of people inside the airplane in long, wide, diagonal 

 shafts, setting afire a touch of golden hair, a resting 

 arm, an infant?s face in the hollow of his mother?s neck?. 

 Mohanty portrays Anjali?s relationship with her father with 

 rare tenderness. But the depiction of her lovemaking with 

 the men in her life lack the same fervour or passion.

 Nur Jahan?s daughter (Rupa, 

 Rs 295) by Tanushree Podder tells the story of 

 Laadli, daughter of Nur Jahan who was married to the Mughal 

 emperor. A childhood spent in the royal courts, despite 

 the trappings of luxury, had its own pitfalls ? treachery, 

 doomed love, and palace intrigue. Living a life under the 

 shadow of the crafty and ambitious Nur Jahan, Laadli is 

 forced to call upon her strengths to meet the challenges 

 with remarkable detachment. Podder?s description of the 

 goings-on in the Mughal court is both real and fascinating.

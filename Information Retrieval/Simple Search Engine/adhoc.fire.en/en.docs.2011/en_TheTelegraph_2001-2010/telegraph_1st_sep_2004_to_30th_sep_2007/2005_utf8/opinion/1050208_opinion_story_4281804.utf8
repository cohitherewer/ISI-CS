 POWER TO A FEW, MISERY FOR THE REST 

A separate state rarely answers the problems of a region. 

In fact, it does nothing more than whet a few people?s desire for power, writes 

Bhaskar Ghose 

 Whose welfare is it anyway? 

?You know, it?s something we ought perhaps to encourage,? 

a colleague in the home ministry once told me, only half in jest, ?this demand 

for separate states. Eventually we?ll have a large number of tiny, totally unviable 

states, whose chief ministers will be sitting, cap in hand, outside the home minister?s 

door, or outside the finance minister?s door, waiting for grants of some kind. 

It?ll be de facto president?s rule. Total peace and calm. Total control.? 

It seemed funny then, but the funny part?s beginning to wear thin now.

In the last few years we have had three new states: 

Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Uttaranchal. We have a commitment from the ruling 

United Progressive Alliance to the carving out of a new state of Telengana. And 

if we go back some decades, we have the dismemberment of Assam into five states 

? Mizoram, Manipur, Meghalaya and Nagaland and Assam. Then we had Sikkim made 

into a state, so small that it is about the size of the Kalimpong subdivision 

of Darjeeling district, which itself is one of the tiniest subdivisions in the 

state of West Bengal.

We have had a demand for a separate Bodoland, which 

has manifested itself on occasion in bloody massacres of, inevitably, the rural 

poor ? men, women and children. We have had the demand for a separate Gorkhaland, 

which occasioned, at its peak, endless bandhs and demonstrations, the burning 

down of some of the most beautiful buildings some over a hundred years old, privately 

owned or built by the forest and land revenue departments. Then, too, a number 

of people lost their lives.

And now we have a demand from the Dimasa people, who 

live in some districts of Assam and the Dimapur district of Nagaland, wanting 

a separate ?administrative unit? to safeguard their political interests, culture, 

language and traditions. The leader of the People?s Supreme Council of Dimarji 

has had talks with an officer of the home ministry which they have said were ?positive?. 

The humorous, consciously clever remark of my former 

colleague appears less and less funny as the years go by. Do we really want to 

reduce the country to small states of this kind? What will these minute little 

states achieve? More prosperity for their people? Where will they get their revenues 

from? Do the leaders realize just how ridiculous their demands are, when they?re 

reduced to practical terms?

The only thing that one or two of the leaders will 

get is real enough: power, even though it is in a tiny area of the country. But 

to some, any kind of power will do, and is something they are willing to go to 

any lengths to get. Start ?movements? that destroy the economy of a region, as 

the Gorkhaland agitation did, at its height, to the tourism industry and to the 

tea industry; starve the ordinary people by rasta roko agitations, which 

prevent essential food supplies from reaching them; and kill people who live in 

villages in the areas claimed to be this or that state and who do not belong to 

the community to which the agitators belong.

What they need to look at very closely is what a separate 

administrative identity will do to the quality of life of the people in that area. 

Will it help or will it make things more difficult? If a region is dependent on 

the hills near it for water, will it help the people if the region became two 

separate states and then began squabbling for water? We have to look at the never-ending 

quarrel over the Cauveri waters between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu to realize what 

the answer is.

One wonders what the political and administrative 

discourse over the last few decades might have been if the initial demand made 

after independence for linguistic states had been resisted and the citizens of 

the country had learned to accept that the administrative units as they existed 

then would never ever change. Would it have resulted in an extinction of the people 

of Karnataka or Andhra , or the disappearance of Malayalam? Would the Mizo or 

Khasi communities really have been wiped out, or reduced to abject poverty if 

they had not become separate states? The answer is not very easy to find. Politically, 

yes, there are new breeds of ministers and aspirants to political power. But would 

anything else have been different?

It may well be that an inevitable result, or progression 

to a struggle for independence is the assertion of regional identities; and surely 

the answer to that would be to nurture those identities, and foster them in all 

their complexity. But does this require the formation of separate states? The 

two don?t seem to be linked in any way, except through the desire on the part 

of a few for power. Power-seekers will always, sadly, be with us; they are the 

ones who fight elections to the managing committees of local primary schools as 

fiercely as they fight a war. They?re afflicted with the disease, which is what 

the insatiable desire for power is. It will manifest itself in every aspect of 

social life.

But somewhere we have as a people to recognize this 

disease, and isolate it and the rhetoric of those afflicted by it, from our daily 

lives. If we had done that in those early years, if the first free government 

hadn?t given in to the demand for linguistic states, to the immolation of individuals 

or someone fasting to death, we may well have been today a country with fewer 

and more viable, powerful states which together would have meant a more viable 

and dynamic country, whose Central or federal government acted as a federal government 

should and not like a monarchy which it has the propensity to do.

That it can be done has been shown by the government 

of West Bengal and the Central government in the resolution to the Gorkhaland 

agitation. The fact that a formula has been worked out within the framework of 

the existing state has been an act of statesmanship, not just of the leaders in 

the state and at the Centre, but also by Subash Ghising and his aides. 

Consider the fact that in Darjeeling they speak a 

different language, are ethnically different from the Bengalis, the fact that 

environmentally the area is quite different from the rest of the state, and, for 

good measure, that it is three times as large as the state of Sikkim, and you 

will realize the significance of what the resolution of the initial demand for 

statehood really is, how profound and how important. If this is possible, then 

resolving the other demands ought not to be quite as formidable. Primary to these 

exercises is, of course, giving the areas involved and the people, good governance 

? a government that is responsive, sympathetic, and above all that acts, and delivers. 

That, more than anything else, is the best form of 

persuasion. But with it must come the firm decision to make it clear to the agitators 

that there will be no further carving out of states. This becomes difficult after 

the craven manner in which Uttaranchal, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh were agreed 

to, but there are new leaders now; one can only hope that they have a greater 

commitment to a viable integrated country than their predecessors.

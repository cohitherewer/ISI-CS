 CRUMBS FOR ALL

 Politicians have their ways of bending laws to help themselves. What Assam?s chief minister, Mr Tarun Gogoi, has planned to reward a dozen former ministers with is nothing but a fraud on the law that deprived them of their ministerial posts. They were dropped from the cabinet, thanks to a new Central law that limits the size of a ministry to one-third of a legislature?s strength. Unhappy ever since, they put pressure on Mr Gogoi to make amends for the loss. He has apparently succumbed to their pressure and plans to create for them new posts of ?parliamentary secretaries? that will entitle them to many of the ministerial powers. Mr Gogoi?s justification for the move ? that it will improve the government?s ?efficiency? ? will fool no one. His real motive is all too apparent. By offering the sops, he wants to keep his flock united behind him. Even this strategy may not work, as several of the former ministers are unwilling to settle for ?crumbs? in lieu of the real powers of ministers. But the move itself shows, once again, how politicians put self-aggrandizement above public good. 

 The law on the size of ministries primarily aimed at curtailing a government?s wasteful expenditure. Like many other states, Assam has long been in the grip of a financial mess. So much so that the government had to take the extraordinary step of imposing a 10 per cent reduction in the salaries of college and university teachers. Many welfare schemes, particularly in health and education, had to be suspended periodically for lack of funds. The government can barely meet its financial commitment to the state?s only major industry ? tea. Above all, the ethnic insurgencies continue to force a huge drain on the state?s meagre resources. Mr Gogoi thus had little justification for straining the exchequer for what clearly would be wasteful expenditure. His move may end up doing further damage to the state?s economy. Worse, both the chief minister and his partymen thus betray a cynical disregard for public good.

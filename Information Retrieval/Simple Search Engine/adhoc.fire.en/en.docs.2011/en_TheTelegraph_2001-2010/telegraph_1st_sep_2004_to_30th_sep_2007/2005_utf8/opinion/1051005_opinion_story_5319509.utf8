 BY THE LAW

 Every legal debate is an opportunity to interpret the law afresh. To the legal purist, that is the most significant aspect of the Supreme Court?s forthcoming verdict on the case involving the dissolution of the Bihar assembly. It is a unique case that has no precedence in the country?s legal history. The apex court?s rulings in earlier cases questioning a state governor?s role or the dissolution of an assembly had different contexts. Even the Bommai case of 1994, that has come to represent the judicial position in similar controversies, may not be of much help in this case. In all earlier cases in which the governors? actions came up for the court?s scrutiny, elected governments were dismissed. In the case involving Bihar this time, there was no elected government or even an elected assembly. The governor, Mr Buta Singh, dissolved what was, in strict legal terms, a non-existent assembly because the elected members had not had an opportunity to be sworn in as its members. To complicate the matter further, the Election Commission announced the schedule for a fresh poll in the state. The political parties have announced their candidates and kicked off their campaigns. Yet, the court?s coming verdict has made the political process uncertain. A veritable pandora?s box may open if the court declares as illegal Mr Singh?s ? and the Centre?s ? decision to dissolve the new assembly elected last May. 

 However, from the legal point of view, all that really matters is whether the dissolution was constitutionally valid. The five-judge constitution bench of the court, therefore, has to judge the facts of the case in the light of the law. If the bench finds the governor?s action to have been legally untenable, it cannot but say so in clear terms. An unprecedented complication may follow if the court directs the Centre to restore the dissolved assembly. That would render the current electoral exercise in Bihar invalid. But such a verdict could raise fresh questions on the court?s right to interfere with the elections. It is important, though, that the court takes the opportunity to clarify the law in relation to the role and powers of the governor. Fractured electoral mandates have become a major source of political instability in the country. Governors acting as political agents of the rulers in New Delhi only make things worse. Besides, it must be a fundamentally flawed system that leaves important matters of state to the discretion of an individual.

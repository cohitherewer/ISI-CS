 A RARE MOMENT

 Anything that promises to end the blood-letting in Assam should be a welcome sign. The important thing is to keep the promise alive. This, perhaps, is the most heartening aspect of the Centre?s ceasefire agreement with the National Democratic Front of Bodoland. The outfit had declared a unilateral ceasefire sometime back. New Delhi and Dispur needed to be absolutely sure of the group?s intentions before entering into a formal agreement with it. As the guns fall silent, the NDFB must come out with clearer evidence of its desire for peace. This would also be its opportunity to think more seriously about the democratic option, especially within the Bodoland Territorial Council. The Bodo Liberation Tigers, which laid down arms to join democratic politics, has shown the way. The council has also come to represent the aspirations of the peace-loving people in Bodo-dominated areas of Assam. The NDFB gave the people a new hope when it declared its own ceasefire. Now that the Union and state governments have responded in equal measure, it should be time for the next stage in the peace process. It is not just a question of making the peace more durable; the talks with the NDFB can actually lead to an improvement in the structure and working of the council. 

 In the context of the entire North-east, however, there is a larger dimension to the agreement with the NDFB. Of all the militant outfits in the region, it is known to have the closest links with the United Liberation Front of Asom, the principal insurgent group in Assam. With the ceasefire with the Naga groups working successfully for seven years, the accord with the NDFB signals the region?s march toward peace. The ULFA ? and some smaller groups ? still remain outside this ambit of peace initiatives. It is almost certain that the truce with the NDFB will have its impact on these outfits. Assam?s chief minister, Mr Tarun Gogoi, has to see that the opportunity is not lost. While the Centre is expected to help its moves, it remains primarily Dispur?s responsibility to engage the NDFB in meaningful talks. The last thing that Mr Gogoi needs is to let narrow political interests upstage the peace run. If he plays his cards carefully with the last of the Bodo insurgents, he might also prepare the stage for his liaison with the ULFA. It is a rare moment of expectancy for the entire region.

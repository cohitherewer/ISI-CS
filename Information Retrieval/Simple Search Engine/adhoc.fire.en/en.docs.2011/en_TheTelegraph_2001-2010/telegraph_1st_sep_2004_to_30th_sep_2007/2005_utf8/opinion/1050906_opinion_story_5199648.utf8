 HONING OLD SKILLS

 Malvika Singh

 And now the bureaucrats have begun to fight the Right to Information Bill. Not surprising, they are the worst culprits of the total lack of information and therefore accountability. Gradually, this country seems to be heaving towards some semblance of change by trying to enforce a fresh ethic through a restructuring of inherited norms and laws. Are we moving out of being a brown vs brown colonial state into a modern nation- state? Will the next generation see an India that is not suffocated by the ?steel frame?? Will the intrinsic entrepreneurship that lies latent in all Indians be unleashed and then be endorsed by those who administer and run the basic infrastructure, a critical ingredient for the end product to be competitive and first rate? Or, will they continue to sabotage this raring-to-go country?

 This is a young nation where a majority of citizens are under 40 years of age. India is today the largest, most vibrant pool of men and women, some literate, others not, but all skilled in some area or the other. Masters in building techniques, in weaving and embroidery, in music and dance, in pottery and metalwork, in traditional medicine like ayurveda, homeopathy and other such forms, in information technology, engineering, film-making?these individuals and collectives have never been given the basic infrastructure to be truly productive. The world has finally come to the conclusion that this is the most valuable human resource left to ?exploit?. All else has been sapped dry without the necessary thought and care.

 Let it breathe

 Unfortunately, Indian governments have been uninterested in this energetic sector. Schemes were put in place by those who laid the parameters after independence but the babu mentality that wanted to ape middle-class Western values, ethics and aspirations, neglected what are the true strengths of Bharat. Perfectly sane approaches for the Fifties and Sixties were mismanaged by the ?rulers? and administrators only because they knew no better. They may have been literate but were uninformed, unthinking, uncaring and unconnected with the real skilled India. They preferred to use plastic and aluminium, live with concrete and glass, wear polyester trousers and badly stitched nylon shirts, eat out of melaware plates and much more, thereby alienating and destroying all that was the real asset of this society. 

 All that Kamaladevi Chattopadhyaya and Pupul Jayakar did for this enormous sector, was diluted and virtually dismantled by a bureaucracy that failed to comprehend and enforce the growth of this vast area that is today defined as knowledge-based industry. Those women were far ahead of their times. They were stalwarts compared to the administrators of those departments today. Where private initiative has intervened, skill has blossomed. Where governments rule, skills die slowly, invaded by a cancer called ineptitude laced with faulty thinking. 

 Will this government, that talks about bringing a historic change, take some sensible decisions to allow a resurgence of tested traditions and skills? Will it begin to respect this sector? Will it facilitate these varied professions to enter the development process? No ?subsidies? are required here, but administrations have to begin to do their jobs legitimately and with integrity, put in a working infrastructure which is their mandate, and cease to exploit this section of real Indians. This business of putting the administrative services on an ivory pedestal is no longer acceptable. If Manmohan Singh and his coalition can ensure that radical transformation, it will be ?historic?. 

 Take away as much as is possible from government. Reduce its intervention in our lives. Streamline its duties and functions. Reduce its burgeoning numbers. Allow India to breathe normally.

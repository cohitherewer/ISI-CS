 Letters to Editor

 Being trendy

 Sir ? As a former employee of the National Dairy Development Board, I was saddened by the news of the power struggle between Amrita Patel and her mentor, V. Kurien (?Court blow to Kurien order?, April 21) and alarmed by its potential to tarnish the image of the Institute of Rural Management. The creation of Amul, NDDB and IRMA was part of Kurien?s vision. What is surprising is that it took 25 years for Patel to turn around and wag a finger at her mentor. But given the recent trend of power struggles in business houses, NDDB too could not be far behind.

 Yours faithfully,

 Ill health

 Sir ? The two separate incidents of molestation and the attempted theft of a baby at the R.G. Kar Hospital point a finger at the sorry state of management in government-run hospitals (?Hospitals for snatching babies, molesting patients?, April 21). Such incidents are so routine that they hardly make headlines nowadays. The Telegraph should be thanked for giving the news such attention. The carelessness of the management is evident from the fact that the woman who tried to run away with the baby reportedly visited the labour ward regularly for five days before she made her attempt. Had it not been for the guards at the gate, the woman would have been successful in her mission. The second incident is a another blot on doctor-patient relationship, which has been fast deteriorating. The very fact that two outsiders could enter a female ward unnoticed and molest patients is shocking. Even more shocking is the news of their escape. Why were they allowed to go scot-free? 

 Yours faithfully,

Sayantan Das, Konnagar

 Sir ? The two recent incidents at R.G. Kar are shameful. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s government is busy developing the IT sector in the state, but what about providing people the basic amenities they are entitled to? Why do people have to go to other states for treatment? 

 Yours faithfully,

 Chilling reminder

 Sir ? ?The truth about Hitler? (April 17) by Amit Chaudhuri sent a chill down the spine again. Adolf Hitler may have done unpardonable things, but he did manage to bring together the German nation. Today, Germans are among the best engineers in the world, and barring the Japanese, they are the most efficient and disciplined workers. How many Indians would want their lunch break trimmed from one hour to 15 minutes voluntarily to make extra progress? This is where Hitler succeeded, though by unfair means. He gave Germans an identity and a feeling of belonging. We could try and forgive Hitler for his sins, but thank him for the discipline he inculcated in his people. 

 Yours faithfully,

Basudev Roy, Maryland, US

 Sir ? Amit Chaudhuri?s article on Hitler disappointed, lacking in information about the man. As for Indians, they should be thankful to the dictator for unleashing World War II that emaciated most of the major European nations. The colonial powers like Britain, France, Germany, Belgium lost so much of their manpower that they found it impossible to hold on to their colonies and were thus forced to grant them independence. 

 Of course, the Congresswallahs will continue try making Indians believe that it was their satyagraha under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi that got the country its independence. The recent replays of the Dandi march and similar other landmarks in the struggle for independence evince this effort. 

 Yours faithfully,

C.V.K. Moorthy, Calcutta

 DOUBLE FOCUS

 The first-ever meeting between the prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, and representatives of the All Party Hurriyat Conference needs to be welcomed. The challenge now is to take this dialogue forward and make it more inclusive of the diverse shades of opinion that exist in Jammu and Kashmir. A comprehensive dialogue between opinion leaders from the state and the Central government will also compliment the composite dialogue between India and Pakistan. 

 For some months now, Mr Singh has explicitly stated that he is willing to speak unconditionally to any group from Jammu and Kashmir as long as it abjures violence. Indeed, at least a couple of times in the past, there was the possibility of a meeting, but last minute hitches prevented the talks from happening. Moreover, the Hurriyat?s own indecisiveness and internal politics have prevented a real dialogue. For one, the Hurriyat is a divided house. The hardline faction led by Mr Ali Shah Geelani has broken away and set up its own organization. And so has the more moderate wing led by Mr Sajad Lone. The Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front, led by Mr Yasin Malik, has also dissociated itself from the Hurriyat. For another, the Hurriyat wanted to make sure that its primary sponsor, Pakistan, did not disapprove of a dialogue with New Delhi. Mr Pervez Musharraf, and the top leadership of Pakistan, seem to have given the green signal to the Hurriyat leaders during their recent visit to that country. 

 Clearly, there are two conflicts in Jammu and Kashmir: between India and Pakistan, and between New Delhi and the people of the state. Both need to be addressed. The Hurriyat may not represent the majority opinion in the state, but it clearly reflects the sentiment of a section of the population in the Kashmir valley that has been alienated because of New Delhi?s policies. The meeting between Mr Singh and the Hurriyat leaders has opened up the possibility of more Kashmir-specific confidence-building measures. These include a time-bound review of cases of those held under the Public Safety Act or those who were detained under the now-defunct Prevention of Terrorism Act. Mr Singh has also signalled that more troops could be withdrawn from the state if the violence and infiltration went down. In turn, the Hurriyat has committed itself to a dialogue with New Delhi and abjured violence. The time may now have come to set up a task force in New Delhi to carry forward a sustained dialogue with opinion leaders from all three regions of the state ? Kashmir, Jammu and Ladakh. Simultaneously, the dialogue on Kashmir with Pakistan must be sustained. In the past, efforts to build peace in Kashmir have been derailed because the two dialogues were not carried on in tandem. The meeting with the Hurriyat suggests that this may be changing.

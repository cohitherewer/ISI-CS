 Paperback Pickings

 Geniuses come to breakfast

 Tennyson?s gift (Profile, Rs 195) by Lynne Truss is the author?s fourth novel, although she is most famous for her unforgettable work on punctuation, Eats, Shoots amp; Leaves. Her sense of comedy, her wit and her smart, unfussy turn of phrase have made this novel, too, extremely funny. In the summer of 1864, the Isle of Wight is crowded with 19th century geniuses, from Tennyson and Lewis Carroll to Ellen Terry and G.F. Watts. Geniuses are difficult to live with ? and live down. Tennyson?s wife panics at the sight of an unkind parody of In Memoriam in Punch: ?Emily was so surprised by its appearance that she tore out the page at the breakfast table, panicked what to do next, then stuffed it into her mouth, chewed it, and swallowed it.? Alice?s Wonderland is obviously close by.

 The idea of perfection (Penguin, Rs 395) by Kate Grenville is in many ways reminiscent of Annie Proulx?s landscape novels, placing as it does persons within the context of natural surroundings that are as much part of the characters as representative of the region. The novel focuses on the joys, meannesses and puzzlements of a dying country town. Loneliness and despair as well as reticent middle-aged attraction and the longing for acceptance are represented with deft sensitivity against a backdrop of an unexpectedly vast sky. 

 Empire of knowledge: Culture and plurality in the global economy (Vistaar, Rs 380) by Vinay Lal offers a dissenting perspective on the politics of knowledge. Its criticism of the intellectual and cultural assumptions that lie at the basis of contemporary ideas of development, modernization and globalization is spread over seven chapters, and it presents Gandhi as the example to be studied as the model of dissent in the future.

 In the other bengal: A creative travelogue (SAARC, Rs 98) by Ramkumar Mukhopadhyay has been translated from the Bengali by Jayita Sengupta. Commissioned by the Foundation of SAARC writers and literature, this work is a ?cultural travelogue?, seeking to re-negotiate the ?genetic, generic and generational links? that Bangladesh has with Bengal. Observations of cultural connections are enriched by a combination of history and nostalgia.

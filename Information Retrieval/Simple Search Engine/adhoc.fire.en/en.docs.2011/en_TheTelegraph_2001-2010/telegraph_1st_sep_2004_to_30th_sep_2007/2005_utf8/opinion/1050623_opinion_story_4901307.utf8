 EDITOR COMES LAST

 Gouri Chatterjee

 By March, the bright yellow billboards had begun lighting up the Mumbai skyline and surveyors had fanned out across the city, asking locals to ?Speak up. It?s in your DNA.? 

 By April, the spanking new office in Lower Parel (fast becoming Mumbai?s Fleet Street) was ready. Rows of computers with black dust covers sporting the DNA logo in white, waiting to be turned on.

 By early June, the funky office was humming with subs staring at screens, managers distributing sweets to mark the second round of their survey, editors ? and there were several of them ? holding forth in their monk?s cell-like cabins. 

 By mid-June, stories were being commissioned, the design was being finalized, dummy pages were being made. The run-up to an end-July launch had begun. 

 From today, there will be, finally, an editor with a capital E. Calcutta boy Gautam Adhikari (55) reached Mumbai last night to take over as the chief editor of DNA. 

 This is not the conventional order of things of course. The norm is that you get an editor first who then takes charge of the rest. At least of the content and the looks of the paper, the hiring of journalists, etc. 

 But breaking conventions is what newspapers are into these days. Even ?Editors? no longer see themselves as the omnipotent figures they once were. Not even someone like Gautam Adhikari, the ?last of the gentleman editors,? according to a former Times of India colleague. With his stints at Harvard, the World Bank and the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, Adhikari could also claim to be more than just a mere hack. 

 Yet, ask him about his role in the new paper and he says, ?I see it as providing coordinated leadership, a central direction.? An editor today, he adds, ?is like a coach, a team leader.? More a Greg Chappell with the reins firmly in the hands of the cricket control board than an Alex Fergusson, sad to say. 

 One world

 Macaulay?s children are soon going to get a chance to repay their debt. Hail Indian circulations, growing daily. How they cheer up media bosses far, far away in London. 

 The inexorable slide downward of graphs at home has turned British papers eastwards. India, with the changes announced by the information and broadcasting minister last week, beckons. It won?t be long before you?ll get the Financial Times delivered to your doorstep every morning. Or read the Daily Mail, Britain?s best-written, best-produced tabloid, on our Metro. 

 The original pink paper may have a tie-up with the Business Standard, but it still wants to publish a facsimile edition here. Our richie rich will go for it and global advertisers will pay for it. It?s long been one world for the affluent.

 But the dummy pages the Mail men are showing around in Delhi are not facsimiles. They carry exclusive Indian stories, something our laws are yet to permit. Either they know something we don?t or they are preparing the ground well in advance. 

 The daily snooze

 This is one practice Indian editors are unlikely to emulate. Fortunately. Last week, Robert Whitehead, editor of the Sydney Morning Herald, ordered chairs to be removed from the room where the daily edit meetings are held. The meeting, where sectional heads lay out their day?s stories and fight to get on to page 1, is now held with everyone standing up. Result: it has sped up the conferences remarkably. If Indian papers follow suit, breathe slowly. Editors will have too much time on their hands for anyone?s good. At the very least, it would deprive us of such spectacles as a certain section editor toppling backwards onto the floor one afternoon after a particularly long lunch.

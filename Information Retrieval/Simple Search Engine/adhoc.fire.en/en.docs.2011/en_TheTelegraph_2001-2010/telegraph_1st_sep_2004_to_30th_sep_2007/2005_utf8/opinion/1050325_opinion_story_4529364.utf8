 And the magic lives on

 A still from Rosemary?s Baby

 501 Must-See movies

 Edited by Emma Beare,

 One man?s art film is another 

 man?s antidote for insomnia. The lover of the French New 

 Wave will scorn those who love Hollywood classics. Such 

 extreme opinions can never even begin to answer the question: 

 was Alfred Hitchcock an art-film maker or a mere entertainer? 

 How does one characterize Chaplin? Neither of the two masters 

 would accept a category called art film. Both saw themselves 

 as entertainers. ?It?s only a mooovie,? Hitchcock loved 

 to croon.

 This reviewer is second to none in his appreciation of Bergman, Truffaut, Fellini and Ray, but he still loves Casablanca and he believes that in cinematic terms that scene in North By Northwest, where Cary Grant runs among a field of corn to avoid an aircraft trying to kill him, remains unsurpassed.

 Cinephiles are notoriously opinionated. But this book is not for the committed film-lover who knows his films, frame by frame, director by director, from award to award. On the contrary, it is for the person taking his first steps in watching films and in need of some kind of guidance when he goes to the local video store or to the movie theatre that shows ?oldies?.

 As a help book for the newcomer, this volume divides films into the following genres: action, adventure and epic, drama, comedy, horror, musical, mystery and thriller, romance, science fiction and fantasy, war and western. It will be labouring the obvious to add that these categories do not cover all kinds of films. Where, to take an example, would one place Visconti?s The Leopard or a film like Scent of a Woman? How does The Godfather fall into the category of mystery and thriller?

 Within these obvious limitations, this book serves its self-appointed purpose well. It has all the credit details of the films ? director, producer, main actors and actresses, screenplay and, in relevant cases, academy award nominations and academy awards. These are accompanied by very well written short reviews of the films. 

 The reviews have delightful tidbits. Talking of famous lines from Casablanca, the review points out that one of the most misquoted lines from the film is ?Play it again, Sam?, which actually comes from the Marx Brothers? A night in Casablanca. Similarly, in the review of Howard Hawks?s Rio Bravo, we are informed that this was intended to be the director?s riposte to High Noon which both Hawks and John Wayne (the star of Rio Bravo, and of most well-known westerns) hated. But the review fails to add that Hawks?s film, in terms of sheer cinema, nowhere matches Fred Zinnemann?s classic which it sought to challenge and answer.

 The choices made in this book are subjective and are supposed to guide the novice cinephile into the marvellous world of cinema. But what happens to a new film-buff who is not asked to see Eisenstein?s Battleship Potemkin, Satyajit Ray?s Pather Panchali, Truffaut?s 400 Blows, Hitchcock?s Rope and a sundry others which have enriched the world of cinema and our understanding of films? This only underlines the point that list-making is a dicey business.

 As a film buff, I will keep this tome on my shelf, but already the endpapers are full of names of favourites that have been left out. I suspect other readers will do the same. But that is part of the delight of a book like this.

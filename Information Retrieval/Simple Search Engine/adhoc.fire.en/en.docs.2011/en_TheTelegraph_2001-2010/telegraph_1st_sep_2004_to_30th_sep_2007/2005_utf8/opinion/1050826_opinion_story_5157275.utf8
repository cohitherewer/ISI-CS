 BILL AND COO

 There is much to be said for traditional wisdom. Sages, businessmen and fiery-eyed novelists have insisted through the ages that women are the root cause of the world?s troubles. Indian legislators would be only too eager to agree ? and point with enthusiastic mournfulness at the bill for women?s reservation in legislative bodies. Ever since it was introduced, the bill has provoked passionate debate outside the parliament and everything from frenzy and violence to furtive evasion within it. Successive governments have each declared their sincere intention of getting the bill through, and have each appeared to throw in a very wet towel soon after. What is interesting is the attitude of some of the bill?s supporters. This group, culled from different parties, feels that this rough grab at fairness should be fine-tuned. For example, there should be separate reservations for women who belong to underprivileged segments: a blanket reservation for all women would hurt them. There is enough fascinating political correctness in this suggestion to provoke new arguments. And so it goes on.

 Those politicians who refuse point-blank to support the bill are easier to understand. The history of the bill?s non-passage is punctuated by strange episodes, such as the one in which most of the members of the parties supporting the bill were absent on the day the bill was to be tabled. Increasing the total number of seats in the Lok Sabha so that men too get more seats is another kind of evasion. The left has declared itself committed to the bill, and the Congress has not left itself much scope for doubt either. The left has pointed out the flaw in the Election Commission?s suggestion that all political parties reserve 33 per cent of their tickets for women. This could sabotage the intention behind the bill, the left has said, because parties could simply give these tickets to weak candidates. Why is solution so difficult? The Congress and the left parties can set an example by distributing tickets in a way that one-third of their winning candidates are women. It is a question of intention, not of the nitty-gritty of law. There is perhaps an unspoken, secret fear. Without a law that enforces uniformity among parties, the women candidates of individual parties might lose the seats because they would not be fighting from reserved constituencies. In the campaign for women?s reservations, the emphasis is on reservations, not women.

 HOW DEEP IS THE ROT?

 Public Institutions in India: performance and Design Edited 

 by Devesh Kapur and Pratap Bhanu Mehta, 

 Oxford, Rs 695

 The editors? purpose in this volume, writes Devesh Kapur, is to analyse the design, performance and adaptability of the principal institutions of governance in India. They single out corruption and lack of accountability among public officials as the worst features of India?s public institutions. Even more heinous is the immunity enjoyed by those responsible for the most terrible transgressions. The poor accountability of public bodies extends to and is amplified by the institutions of civil society. Instead of enforcing accountability, the Indian state has ?put in [place] even more intricate and suffocating rules? that take away the operational autonomy and discretion of officials. As a result, the officers with initiative have stagnated while the corrupt have prospered.

 However, as S.K. Dey says, India can boast of institutions that enforce internal accountability and provisions by which public officials may be held responsible for their actions. The comptroller and auditor general, the Central Vigilance Commission and the Central Bureau of Investigation are some of these. But these bodies have not delivered as expected. For one thing, investigation has been flawed, leading to the disappearance of vital evidence. The delay in the Bofors and St Kitts investigations by the CBI are glaring instances of this.

 Talking about the Indian judiciary, Pratap Bhanu Mehta finds fault with the appointment of judges. ?It seems the independence of the judiciary... [is] shielding it from any accountability for the appointments it makes.? The biggest weakness of the Indian judiciary, according to Mehta, is the legal profession itself. India has about 336 lawyers per million people ? a high number for a developing country. But the quality of the legal professionals, leaving aside the cream at the top, plummets fast and it is the low and middle-level lawyers who have the most damaging influence.

 Arvind Verma turns the scanner on the police, and assesses how well they have been able to deal with the social and political problems confronting India. Until now we have had a malleable police force that has been used for partisan ends. The force needs reforms and Verma argues that it is for the politicians to bring them about. However, the latter have not shown the will or the interest to do so and neither have the police top bosses, most of whom have been compromised by the growing corruption and the catering to political interests.

 Deena Khatekhae is highly critical of the Reserve Bank of India. She regrets that ?as an economic institution...it has still many miles to traverse.? Other public institutions ? the parliament, president and India?s federal institutions and economic reforms ? come in for similar censure in this volume .

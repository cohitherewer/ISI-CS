 Minor vices

 Sir ? Quotas for the minorities in specialized institutions like the Indian Institutes of Management or the Indian Institutes of Technology is not a good idea as in India no religious minority, in its entirety, qualifies as a socially and educationally backward class (?Move for IIT, IIM minority quota?, Nov 16). Moreover, every minority has an elite segment, in other words, a creamy layer, which is on par with the elite of the majority community. Quotas for the minorities would mean quotas for this class. This would certainly not improve the social and educational conditions of the targeted minority. To improve the collective lot of the minority, we need to focus on primary and secondary levels of education, and bring a wider population under the cover of the Central educational schemes like the Sarva Shikshya Abhiyan. It will not make sense to leave a large chunk of Muslims in the unreformed madrasahs while reserving seats for elite Muslims in IIMs and IITs.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? If the government wishes to ensure genuine social justice to the minorities, it should implement the recommendation of the National Minority Commission for Minority Education for reservation of seats for minorities in IITs and IIMs. Such a progressive step will allow Muslims of the lower strata of Indian society to find their place in the national mainstream. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Abdulruff Colachal, New Delhi

 Sir ? The excuse offered by the HRD ministry to reserve seats in the premier institutes is a poor representation of the minorities in these institutes. But is it anybody?s fault if some members of the minority community think that sending their children to madrasahs is a better option than sending them to schools? More than 2 lakh candidates all over India appear for the IIT-JEE for admission to undergraduate courses for which only 2,500 seats are available. This includes 23 per cent reservation for SCs, STs and the physically handicapped. To add another 7 per cent reservation for the minorities will make the youth vulnerable to tremendous stress. 

 Yours faithfully,

Anomit Ghosh, Kharagpur

 Sir ? We always knew that it takes something extraordinary to get into an IIT or a top IIM. However, if the human resource development ministry is to have its way, a minority stamp could go a long way in getting someone certified as ?brilliant?. The basic idea behind the quota-system is to give the underprivileged an equal chance to excel. But does it mean that a student from a minority or an SC/ST community is economically deprived as well? Do reservations do justice to the brilliant but poor general-category candidate who, far from getting admission, cannot even buy the expensive admission-form? Any special consideration shown to anyone should be need-based or based on a combination of need and merit. The institutes could ask prospective students to submit accounts of family status and income besides the educational records. The deserving could then be identified and the institute could sponsor their education. The top universities could also bring down the prices of application-forms if the financially poor yet intellectually rich are to get where they deserve to be.

 Yours faithfully

 Sir ? It is no surprise that the HRD minister, Arjun Singh, should offer to reserve seats in IITs and IIMs. A few days back, he had made an equally controversial suggestion of reserving 50 per cent seats for Muslim students in the post-graduate medical course in the Aligarh Muslim University. Despite being severely criticized by the Allahabad high court for breach of secular norms, he seems to have learnt nothing from the verdict. He wishes to continue playing the messiah of the minorities. 

 Yours faithfully,

Saroj Kumar Mishra, Puri

 Sir ? The root cause of backwardness among SCs, STs, other backward classes as also the minorities is the government?s indifference to primary education. This is corroborated by statistics. During the last 57 years, primary schools have grown only 3.2 times, while secondary institutions have grown 30 times and colleges 20 times. Instead of providing quotas for the minorities in premier institutions and diluting the standards of higher education, the government should first ensure greater access for them at the primary level through scholarships and other incentives. 

 Yours faithfully,

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? The recommendation of the NMCME for reserving seats for minorities in IITs/IIMs, smacks of a deep-rooted conspiracy to demoralize members of the minority communities and arraign them against the majority community. One should remember that Maulana Abul Kalam Azad had sternly opposed any reservation for Muslims in the Constituent Assembly. He believed that recruitment or admission to educational or technical institutions must be based strictly on merit. So far one has not heard of any discrimination in favour of Muslims in the recruitment process for the civil services, or the IIMs/IITs, where bright students have found their due place. The NMCME should have kept the sensibilities of the minority communities in mind before raking up such a controversy. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shariq Alavi, Lucknow

 Sir ? We cannot keep reminding people of their separate identities and yet expect them to join the national mainstream. The HRD ministry is planning to train bright Muslim students in coaching centres run by the faculty members of premier institutes, obviously free of cost. But will this not amount to an additional financial burden on these institutions? Besides, will the ministry please explain what it means by ?bright? students? Is there any reason to reserve seats if they are really bright? 

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

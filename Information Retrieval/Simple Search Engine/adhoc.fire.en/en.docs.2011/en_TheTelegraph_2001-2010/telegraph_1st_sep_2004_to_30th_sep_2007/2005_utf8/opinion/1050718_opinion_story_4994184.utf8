 Grave mistake

 Sir ? The government of India has, in its attempt to woo Muslim voters, allowed namaz to be read in the Taj Mahal premises on Fridays, thus communalizing a World Heritage Site. But namaz is read on the maidan, on planes, in trains, nearly everywhere. Can all of these be declared Wakf property? While everybody in secular India has the right to pursue his religion, it cannot and should not be at the cost of misusing properties of historical interest. The Taj has been synonymous with India since 1656, when Isha Afandi completed this architectural masterpiece, which is also a marvel of structural engineering ? such a massive structure on inclined piles on a river bed withstanding the vagaries of nature for 350 years. Islamic architecture is famous for the four ?M?s ? mosques, makbaras, minars and mausoleums. While the first is reserved for prayers, the others are not. It will be a grave mistake to treat the Taj as just a grave.

 Yours faithfully,

Manish Chandra Bose, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is surprising that the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Wakf Board has decided in its own favour over the ownership of the Taj Mahal (?The Taj not a teardrop, but a grave?, July 14). The Taj is India?s pride, and the Union government should get appropriate laws passed to bring it under the jurisdiction of the Centre, like the Red Fort and Qutab Minar. This will also check plans to disturb the Taj with ideas such as the Taj corridor, hatched during Mayavati?s regime in UP.

 Yours faithfully,

Subhash C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir ? The decision of the U.P. Sunni Central Wakf Board to declare the Taj Mahal as a Wakf property is not altogether a good step. The board claims that the monument is its property, whereas a few weeks back, a descendant of the Mughal dynasty staked a claim to the Taj?s ownership on inheritance grounds. The decision of the Wakf board will affect the Taj?s status as a World Heritage Site as well as its security and maintenance. The board is hardly equipped to conduct proper maintenance of the Taj Mahal. The Wakf board would do well to confine its activities to starting the five-time prayer routine in the mosque located in the premises and the maintenance of the graves of the kith and kin of the Mughals.

 Yours faithfully,

Md. Mudassir Alam, New Delhi

 Sir ? The status quo of the Taj Mahal should not be allowed to be disturbed by anybody, be it the Sunni Wakf board or descendants of Bahadur Shah Zafar. I think the Archaeological Survey of India, which has been the custodian of the monument all this while, is doing a splendid job. There is no reason why it should not remain the caretaker and manager of the Taj. Groups and individuals who are vying with each other to claim ownership of the Taj are only interested in the monument?s annual earning of Rs 15 crore. The ASI should move the court against the Wakf board?s decision on the ground that it is one thing to manage and maintain a graveyard, and entirely another to look after a structure of the order of the Taj Mahal. 

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur 

 Sir ? The two most outrageous things about the recent controversy around the Taj Mahal are: one, the audacity and perversion of the Sunni Wakf board to claim a national treasure as its ?property?, and two, the lack of a strong, united voice of condemnation and outrage among the entire political and academic class. These have once more exposed the abysmal standards to which our national consciousness, public discourse and collective respect for our heritage and history have sunk. One is ashamed to think that now the Supreme Court may have to tell the concerned Wakf board in no uncertain terms that its demands are nothing short of criminal and anti-national. 

 It is time, however, that historians and academicians de-mystified the Taj a bit ? by bringing to light the controversy about Burhanpur being the original burial ground of Mumtaz Mahal and the contesting theories about who built the monument. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Jit Majumder, Calcutta

 Sir ? Where are the radical Islamic groups who claim that praying in the dargah of Nizamuddin Auliya is un-Islamic? Shouldn?t offering namaz at the Taj Mahal be unislamic by the same logic? The Sunni leadership should be actively discouraged to destabilize the national integrity of India by suddenly coming up with the claim of ownership of the Taj Mahal. The fact that the claim is based on religious grounds makes the whole issue dangerous enough to cause rents in India?s delicate communal fabric.

 Yours faithfully,

 Olin Sinha, Calcutta

 PRICE OF DIVISION

 Election results in Left Front-ruled West Bengal seldom, if ever, go beyond the expected. Thus the left?s return to power in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation has not surprised anyone. But this victory cannot bring any comfort or relief to the left, especially to the Communist Party of India (Marxist) which spearheads the Left Front. The majority that the left has in the Calcutta Corporation is by no means overwhelming. The CPI(M) is far removed from claiming that Calcutta is a left bastion. Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s growing popularity among the affluent and the middle classes of Calcutta has not translated into votes in any noticeable way. In fact, there are very good grounds to argue that the left?s position in the city would have been further eroded if the anti-left votes had not been so woefully divided.

 The division manifested itself in a number of ways. The Trinamool Congress, led by Ms Mamata Banerjee, was more eager to defeat the outgoing mayor, Mr Subrata Mukherjee, who had deserted the TMC before the elections, than to take on the left. Mr Mukherjee, in his turn, mobilized his forces to humiliate Ms Banerjee. The state Congress under the leadership of Mr Somen Mitra virtually withdrew from the fray. The left capitalized on this situation. This showing of the Congress is bewildering since the expectation was that after the obvious decline in Ms Banerjee?s political fortune, the Congress would emerge as the principal opposition to the Left Front in West Bengal. But the Congress is proving to be a reluctant starter in this regard. In West Bengal, it remains bogged down in petty ego and personality issues rather than in building up an organization and a network of allies that can stop the Left Front from taking electoral victories in the state somewhat for granted. If the Congress continues to play as the CPI(M)?s second eleven, the left can go laughing to power in the next round of assembly polls.

 If the results in Calcutta have been along expected lines, those from adjoining Salt Lake have been completely unexpected. More than the victory, it is the scale of it that is startling. The Salt Lake results run contrary to the wardwise voting pattern which was observed in the last Lok Sabha polls. There is no obvious factor that can explain this deviation. This and the available observations of the way the elections were conducted in Salt Lake would suggest that the CPI(M) went about, in its usual efficient way, controlling the polling in its favour. The apparent show of neutrality put up by the police ? witness the treatment of some prominent CPI(M) members ? could not hide the fact that the elections had not been entirely free and fair. This adds strength to the old saying that the more things change, the more they remain the same.

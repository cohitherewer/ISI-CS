 Letters to Editor

 To be human

 Sir ? I commend the Italian people for rejecting the assisted fertility referendum that sought to overturn key provisions in the law that bans donations of sperm and eggs; defines life as beginning at conception; and allows fertility treatment only to ?stable heterosexual couples? who are living together and can prove infertility In heeding the pleas of the pope to boycott the referendum on a fertility law, the Italian people have voiced a resounding ?yes? to life and ?no? to the creeping culture of death (?Italy fertility vote puts pope on test?, June 13). Reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization produce embryos in laboratories, where they are manipulated. The domination of researchers over their embryonic subjects not only opens the door to new threats to life, but also goes against the dignity that underlies the relationship between parents and children. The pre-natal being is not like any other tissue. It is human with its own DNA, indicating that it has the same fundamental and moral rights to life as any other human being. Hopefully, the awareness of these scientific truths will awaken people and governments to their moral obligation to support the natural generation of human life.

 Yours faithfully,

 Paul Kokoski, Ontario, Canada

 Ringing false

 Sir ? Misinterpretation of facts to misguide the public is a common trait in Ashok Mitra?s articles. ?Cellphones in lieu of rice? (June 10) is no exception. The common minimum programme states that public sector companies and nationalized banks will be encouraged to enter the capital market to raise resources and offer new investment avenues to retail investors. Therefore, divesting 10 per cent stake in Bharat Heavy Electrical Limited is entirely in line with the CMP, lest the author forgets that disinvestment is not synonymous with privatization. While lashing out at the Bretton Woods institutions, he fails to understand the basic workings of the market. Who would buy loss-making PSUs and why? If the government wants to raise money to upgrade the shoddy infrastructure or invest in public services, divestment has to be a key fund-raising mechanism. 

 The rural employment guarantee scheme has been rightly sidelined by the finance ministry. Not only would it be a gigantic waste of public resources, but in reality much of the money would end up in the pockets of corrupt bureaucrats. It is an economic fallacy to assume that just because 70 per cent of Indians are employed in agriculture today, the same situation would prevail in the future. We need to shift workers from the farm sector to industries and services so that we can increase productivity in agriculture. If, as Mitra claims, money saved from the employment guarantee scheme is being used to set up mobile phone-manufacturing plants, doesn?t that mean that more erstwhile unemployed Indians are getting a job? 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Aruni Mukherjee, Coventry, UK 

 Sir ? As Ashok Mitra alleges, the Bretton Woods twins ? the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank ? are supposed to have suggested that part of the money allotted for the rural employment guarantee scheme may be diverted to the production of cellphones. There is no way to confirm this, and Mitra, as usual does not name his sources. He just says that the suggestion is ?on offer?. The employment scheme may have been stalled for some reason and there may be even plans to use part of the money for building better roads. But why should that be necessarily such a bad thing for India? And why should the Bretton Woods twins think of promoting cell- phone manufacture with the money when the same purpose would be solved by encouraging more car and truck manufacture by multinationals? 

 Mitra is unhappy that the United Progressive Alliance government?s rural employment guarantee scheme has been only an eyewash, but can he answer why the left has not thought about similar schemes in West Bengal where people are dying of starvation? 

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is shocking that the government could be so blas? about the non-implementation of the much-advertized rural employment generation scheme. Mitra does right by pointing out how like the previous saffron government, the UPA too has indulged in tokenism. The employment generation scheme was scheduled to give employment to one member of each rural family for 100 days in a year. The government has promised an astounding economic rate of growth for the country. Of what good will it be to the country if millions of the rural poor continue to have no purchasing power?

 Yours faithfully, 

 Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur 

 Welcome back

 Sir ? ?Inkling of a rebirth? (June 10) was a pleasant surprise. 

 Names like Sulekha, Bengal Chemicals, Calcutta Chemicals, 

 Jessop, Braithwate, IISCO are reminders of Bengal as an industrial 

 giant. Revival of some of these companies will indicate the 

 re-industrialization of West Bengal. The process can be sustained 

 only if our predominant mentality changes ? from pessimism 

 to undying optimism ? and discipline in public life is enforced. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Kaushik Sarkar, Calcutta

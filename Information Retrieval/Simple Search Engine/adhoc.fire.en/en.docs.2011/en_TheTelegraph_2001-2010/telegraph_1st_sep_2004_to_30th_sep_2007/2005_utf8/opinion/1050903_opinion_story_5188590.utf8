 WHOSE INTEGRATION?

 The unity of India has always been a question of its diversity. The great empires of Indian history ? the Maurya Empire, the Gupta Empire and the Mughal Empire ? gave to India a political unity. The British Empire from around the beginning of the 19th century brought the subcontinent under an administrative and economic unity. But despite the claim made by the British that they imposed unity on what was nothing more than a geographical expression, it is often overlooked that within British India, there were huge chunks of territory ruled by Indian princes where different administrative and economic systems held sway. It was only the independent Indian state that brought India under one uniform system determined by the Constitution of India. There exists other forms of unity which predate ? and some would argue are more important than ? political and economic unity. This relates to the unity of culture. Cultural motifs and practices replicate themselves across the country and have done so for centuries. Diversity of social customs and religious rituals is held together by an overall unity articulated through texts and artistic expression.

 It is in this context that the National Integration Council reiterates, almost like a slogan, the idea that India stands for unity in diversity. A reversal of the terms would be equally meaningful or meaningless. The problem of integration has always been the relationship of the local to the national. This is because the idea of unity and the idea of the national are invariably perceived to be derived from New Delhi or from the agenda of the political party that controls the reins of government. Local knowledge, customs and cultural practices are important components of what constitutes the national. Yet whenever policies are formulated, syllabi fixed and celebrations organized, the putative national prevails over the local. This is the danger of integration that works from the top downwards and not the other way round. The dominance of Delhi might be a threat to integration.

 The other palpable threat to national integration is religious fanaticism and caste oppression. Religious fundamentalism has set one religious community against another. Among the religious minorities there is a feeling of fear about Hindu fundamentalism. The pogrom of Muslims in Gujarat and the massacre of the Sikhs in 1984 have fed this fear. In Jammu and Kashmir, a separatist movement driven by the ideology of militant Islam has disrupted normal life through terror and bloodshed. Caste violence continues. Even as the National Integration Council was meeting, Dalits were attacked in Haryana. Political parties nurture caste-based vote banks and thus underline caste identities. These developments erode the unity of India and also act as obstacles to the development of a genuine national identity. The half-cocked growth of the Indian identity serves only to make Indians more prickly about their own identity and more suspicious of the ubiquitous foreign hand. The terms ?national? and ?integration?, and their use together, remain as problematic today as they were some five decades ago.

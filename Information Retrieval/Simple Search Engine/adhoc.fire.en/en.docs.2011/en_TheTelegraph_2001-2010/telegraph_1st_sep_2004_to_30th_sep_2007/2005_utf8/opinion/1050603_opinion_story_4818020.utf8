 The Empire in a 

 garden 

 Nature rsquo;s government: science, imperial britain, and the lsquo;improvement rsquo; of the world (Orient Longman, Rs 450) by Richard Drayton is an Indian reprint, with an introduction by Mahesh Rangarajan, of a wide-ranging work of historical scholarship, first published in 2000. Drayton rsquo;s book is an attempt to make sense of the origins of the modern world by exploring the interactions of science (in this case botany and horticulture) and imperial expansion. He weaves together the histories of the knowledge and use of plants, and of Britain and its empire. The protagonist of this interlaced narrative is the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew, and Drayton rsquo;s account pursues its origins and achievements. At Kew, throughout the 19th century, ldquo;improving rdquo; the world became a potent argument for both the patronage of science at home and Britain rsquo;s prerogatives abroad. This is a history of this idea of ldquo;improvement rdquo;, from its Christian agrarian origins in the 16th century to its inclusion in the theories of enlightened despotism.

 My body, my 

 wisdom: a handbook of creative dance therapy (Penguin, Rs 250) by Tripura Kashyap is dedicated ldquo;to all those who desire to seek self-renewal through dance and movement rdquo;. It is a quiet, important book, which will initially alienate conventional thinkers on therapy and education for people with special needs. But Kashyap rsquo;s combination of Indian classical dance, yoga, the martial arts and Western movement therapy, in this lucidly written, sensible and innovative book, deserves to be taken seriously.

 Forest of pygmies (HarperCollins, Rs 295) by Isabel Allende is the final instalment of Allende rsquo;s trilogy, written for young readers, about the journeys of Jaguar and Eagle, the totemic animal spirits, who guide Alexander Cold and Nadia Santos, this time through the swampy forests of Ngoube in Africa, where they discover a clan of Pygmies caught up in a world of corruption, slavery and poaching. Humans and spirits then jointly restore their freedom and return leadership to its rightful hands. Allende rsquo;s exoticization of Africa is unabashed, her politics always good-natured and well-intentioned, her Magic Realism unfailingly pretty. The result is a Chilean/African ldquo;fusion rdquo; book, which could well have come free with The Body Shop rsquo;s Avocado and Cocoa Butter Shampoo.

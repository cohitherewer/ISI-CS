 THE MOVE FORWARD

 Tilak D. Gupta

 At first sight, the Bihar polls seem to be an exclusive battle between the other backward classes and Dalits. One doesn?t find a single pretender to the throne from amongst the Brahmins, Bhumihars, Kayasthas and Rajputs ? the traditional rural elite of the Hindi heartland. Unlike Uttar Pradesh, where upper castes still remain claimants for the top job, 15 years of Laloo Yadav-Rabri Devi rule has made it almost impossible for people of superior pedigree to throw their hats in the ring. A sullen Shatrughan Sinha is staying away from electioneering because of his reluctance to recognize this social reality.

 The upper castes, however, have not given up the fight altogether. It is common knowledge that this time they have chosen to solidly back Nitish Kumar, if only to get rid of Laloo Prasad Yadav. Last February, their support got divided between the National Democratic Alliance and Ram Vilas Paswan?s Lok Janashakti Party. They have now ditched Paswan for his refusal to form a government with BJP-support. And that puts Nitish Kumar a notch above his rivals. 

 Paswan however has risked such immediate loss for his long-term project of building an independent Dalit constituency. Since 1967, electoral battles here have been seen as struggles of the upwardly mobile strata of the OBCs to break the upper caste monopoly on power. Paswan is striving to turn the conventional bipolar contest into a triangular fight, where Dalits would constitute an autonomous centre of power in the Mayavati fashion. 

 All in the game

 The substantial increase of the Dalit percentage in Bihar?s electorate following the separation of Jharkhand provides the material basis for his efforts. Although he was one of the leading lights of the 1974 student movement that unseated Abdul Ghafoor, the lone Muslim chief minister Bihar has seen, Paswan is now wooing the minorities with his pledge to install a Muslim at the helm if his party comes to power. But it would be unjust to single out Paswan in the game. Nitish Kumar, once a crusader of Mandal politics, has no qualms in aligning with upper castes.

 The Bihar elections also tell us something about the paradox of the ever-increasing political ambitions of the Yadavs and their fading glory. Given their characteristic militancy, caste cohesion and greater numerical strength, the Yadavs were somewhat destined to spearhead the backward?s quest for power. 

 Drive continues

 That Laloo Yadav became the man for the occasion was an accident. But once in the driver?s seat, he used his exceptional communication skills to build a formidable Dalit-backward-Muslim alliance. This election bears witness to the sharp decline of that powerful front primarily due to attempts of the Yadav community to monopolize the political rewards of the RJD regime.

 However, one is amazed to note the phenomenal number of Yadav candidates in the fray; some contesting as independents. Last February, too, rebel Yadavs spoilt the chances of RJD nominees in about 35 seats. This time, Laloo Yadav has pacified many dissenters within his party, but Yadav candidates with other symbols continue to harm the RJD. Paswan has taken a large chunk of Dalit votes away and Muslims no longer remain RJD loyalists, although the threat of a BJP take-over has driven many back to the RJD fold. 

 Laloo Yadav?s historical role in weakening the upper caste feudal hegemony over Bihar is almost over. The political strengthening of the OBCs under his dispensation is an unalterable reality even if the upper castes return to power. It is time for the extremely backward among the OBCs and the Dalits to enter the corridors of power to complete Bihar?s socio-political churning.

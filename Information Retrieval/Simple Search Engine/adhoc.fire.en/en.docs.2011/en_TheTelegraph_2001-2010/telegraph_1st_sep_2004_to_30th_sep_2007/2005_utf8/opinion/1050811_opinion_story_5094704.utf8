 Letters to Editor

 Bird?s-eye view

 Sir ? In ?Long view of the raj? (Aug 6), Ramachandra Guha charges Manmohan Singh with singing insufficent and ?incomplete? praise of the British rulers. Had the raj been so beneficial to Indians as elitist writers like Guha make out, why did our freedom fighters struggle so hard against it? If India owes all that is good in its system to the British, what would Guha and Singh say for countries which were never colonized? Would they trash their governance? 

Yours faithfully, 

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur 

 Sir ? Ramachandra Guha, quite obviously, likes to move with the times. And so does our prime minister. Being vocal about the misdeeds of our British rulers might have done justice to the nationalist cause, but it would have been suicidal for India?s growth. Even then, those representing India abroad should remain conscious of its past trials and tribulations, the sacrifice made by its leaders. In other words, the international fora should be used to highlight India?s presence, not to dilute its image in order to appease others.

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad 

 Sir ? Both the prime minister and Ramachandra Guha draw our attention to the ideals and institutions that India inherited from the British. These include, among other things, the principle of rule of law and a permanent bureaucracy. The legal and constitutional framework that India adopted after independence has fundamentally remained the same, except for the alterations made from time to time to keep up with the changing socio-economic conditions. For instance, the system of public interest litigations is a practical response from the Indian judiciary to ensure that everyone has an access to law and justice. We cannot but acknowledge the positive consequences of British rule in India. And Singh has done precisely that. His is mature response from a former colony, and needs to be appreciated accordingly. 

 Yours faithfully,

Ashwini Chawla, Calcutta

 Sir ? Ramachandra Guha must be applauded for presenting an unbiased analysis of Manmohan Singh?s speech at Oxford University. As the author correctly notes, the most vehement opposition to Singh came from the right and the left, rather than from the centre ground of Indian politics. And these forces were never a part of mainstream Indian politics, even during the national struggle. While organizations like the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh were against Gandhi?s ideals, the leftists owed their allegiance more to Russia than to India. 

 One can partially defend Singh, though. The raj undoubtedly induced doses of modernity ? there were the railways, telegraph, telephones, automobiles, the concept of democracy and industries. Social evils like sati were stopped with the help of the British. In fact, the British were the ?least of all evils?. Portuguese and French rule were even more barbaric. The British at least had respect for the constitutional process and rule of law, one of the prime reasons why Gandhi was such a phenomenal success. Above all, British rule bequeathed to India the idea of a nation-state, which till then had remained an intangible reality. No one can deny the ill-effects of the raj, but we need to acknowledge its positive impact as well.

 Yours faithfully,

Aruni Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Small is beautiful

 Sir ? The Madhya Pradesh chief minister, Babulal Gaur, has rightly indicated that he may abolish the two-child norm in the panchayat elections if it is not implemented nationwide (?Gaur to junk two-child rule?, July 25). The norm is currently in force in only six states. It should be extended not only throughout the nation, but also to state and Central legislatures. 

 It is senseless to waste public money on incentives for family planning when the target can be easily achieved through disincentives like withdrawing all government facilities to public servants ? ration, medical allowances, the benefits of reservation, jobs or promotions and the right to contest elections. In fact, those with more than two children should be disenfrancised. 

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba

 Sir ? Though the prime minister acknowledges that coercion is ?permissible? in a free society, the target is mainly the educated population (?Progress pill to check birth rate?, July 25). The illiterate, who constitute the bulk of the population, will remain outside the ambit of this state action since the disincentives will not affect them. How will it matter to a person who does not have a square meal that he will be denied his right to vote? This section also constitutes the vote bank of political parties, and hence will remain untouched. A healthy, skilled and educated population are an asset to any nation. Unfortunately, this percentage of the population is bound to go down if there is a systematic drive towards population control. In the 21st century, the country with the largest population will rule the world. But a mere increase in population will not matter as it is likely to convert the country into a source of cheap labour. If the government really wants to bring India to the forefront, it has to concentrate on producing a highly skilled and talented population through various incentives. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Hara Lal Chakraborty, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Manmohan Singh?s speech at the re-constituted National Commission on Population clearly shows that India?s ruling elite still feels that progress and development will solve our population problem. The population of India has grown from 36 crore in 1931 to 110 crore in 2005, and we are still waiting for development to control our population. The policy-makers believe that if we are able to stabilize our population, resources will be released for investments to improve the standards of living of millions of people below the poverty line. The prime minister should start thinking along new lines. 

 Yours faithfully,

Vivek Baid, Siliguri

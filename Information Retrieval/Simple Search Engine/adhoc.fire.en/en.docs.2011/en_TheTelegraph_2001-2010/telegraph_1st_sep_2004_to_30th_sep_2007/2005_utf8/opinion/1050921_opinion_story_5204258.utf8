 KILLING TO WIN

 Achin Vanaik argues that the terrorism of non-state forces like al Qaida is less threatening than that of nations like the US

 Other demons

 Ever since 9/11, there has been a sustained campaign in the West to demonize Islam and Muslims, to make a special connection between them and terrorism. Look at the way Tony Blair responded to the horrific London bombings in July. He first sought to deny any link between the bombings and his government?s involvement in Iraq. He then went on to talk of ?good Muslims? and ?bad Muslims?, although neither he nor any other senior British political leader had ever talked of ?good Catholics? and ?bad Catholics? throughout the period of IRA bombings.

 We need to clear our minds about what political terrorism is, and what it is not. It is not a specific cultural phenomenon but a universal and political one. It is not a special characteristic of Islam or Muslims or of the Muslim world. The biggest danger is from the terrorism carried out directly by states, with the United States of America and Israel heading a list that also includes the likes of Russia, Pakistan, India, China and Britain. Terrorism is a means of political violence, and is capable of being exercised by a variety of agents for a variety of purposes. Terrorism is not an ideology but it always requires an ideological cover and justification.

 Demonizing Islam and Muslims serves the ideological-political needs of the US. Crucial to its empire-building project is the control of the geo-political ?pivot of Eurasia? ? central and west Asia. Here, barring Israel, the countries are Muslim-majority states. It is also an area where a great many of the reigning governments are despised for their authoritarian rule and their subservience to the US, which faces the greatest mass hostility in the region. The US, having successfully thwarted and eliminated secular oppositional currents in the past decades, now finds itself and its allied governments (Arab and central Asian) opposed by a range of Islamist movements and groups. 

 Even among non-state actors, terrorism is not a monopoly of Muslim insurgent groups, as even a casual survey of Hindu and Buddhist extremism in south and south-east Asia, or of Irish, Basque, Corsican extremism in Europe, and of South American insurgencies would reveal. But for the US, these are either regions which are less geo-politically important or areas where its overall authority is more comfortably ensconced. Dealing with Muslim oppositional groups is a serious affair and that is why the selective highlighting of ?Islamic terrorism? is so necessary. It provides a justification for US political-military attention on the ?hotbed? of global terrorism.

 For the US, demonizing Islam and Muslims is invaluable for mobilizing support within the country and within western European nations where anti-Muslim sentiments are on the rise. The 2004 presidential elections in the US saw the coming together of the right wing Christian Evangelists with the upper working class-lower middle class whites, facing socio-economic decline, in support of the Republicans. Among the former, committed to alignment with Israel and concerned about the ?cultural degeneration? of the US, hostility towards Islam, Muslims and Arabs is easy to generate. Among the latter, who are already fearful of their decline into the under-class, anti-Arab/anti-Muslim emotions are being made increasingly acceptable by the mainstream media and public culture. One could even say that this demonization was invaluable in generating support from an increasingly saffronized Indian elite, a Russian government plagued by the Chechen issue and the Chinese government facing increasing unrest from its Muslim-dominated provinces.

 The idea that the terrorism of non-state actors like al Qaida ? despite the undeniable moral obscenity of events like 9/11, the Madrid bombings, the London bombings ? constitutes any kind of serious, let alone mortal, threat to Western societies is an absurdity. These forces lack the capacity to carry out actions that could result in a significant political transformation where they most want it ? overthrowing key pro-US regimes in Saudi Arabia and Egypt for example. Their terrorism is an attempt to undermine public morale in the West and to cash in on the widespread public hostility to US foreign policy among the Muslim population in countries suffering under authoritarian pro-US client regimes. Given the impotence of this ?terrorism of the weak? vis-?-vis the basic social, economic and political structures in the West, the gross exaggeration of the actual threat presented by such terrorism is all the more indefensible and condemnable.

 Just how untenable the presumed link between Islam, Muslims and Arabs on the one hand, and terrorism on the other is, has been highlighted by Robert Page in his remarkable study on suicide terrorism in Dying to Win. He has compiled the first-ever complete database of suicide attacks around the world from 1980 to early 2004. The Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka are the world leaders in suicide terrorism. Suicide terrorism is mainly aimed at foreign occupiers and is demand-driven, that is, not driven by the ?Islamic supply? of religious fanatics. Of the 462 ?successful? suicide attacks since 1980, most were by ?first-time? volunteers.

 It is precisely this fact of sustained and brutal occupation, not the peculiarities of Islamic theology, that provides a constant supply of people willing to carry out suicide bomb attacks. Iraq brings this out clearly. Before the invasion and occupation by the US, Iraq had no suicide terrorist attack in its history. There were 20 such attacks in Iraq in 2003, 48 in 2004, and over 50 in the first five months of 2005. Most of the suicide terrorists are Iraqi Sunnis and Saudis.

 The US has 150,000 troops in the Saudi peninsula and another 130,000 in Iraq, and it supports Israel?s military occupation and control of Palestine. It is this US-Israeli presence that fuels suicide terrorism, not any presumed Islamic rejection of the West. Otherwise, Iran, with a population three times that of Iraq, would be the ?hotbed? of al Qaida-type terrorism. Although Sudan is ruled by a Muslim fundamentalist regime, it does not produce terrorists. In fact, two-thirds of all suicide attacks are from countries where the US has stationed large contingents of combat troops. A large part of the remaining one-third is in Israel-Palestine. When occupier and occupied are of different religions, it is more likely that demonization of the occupied by the occupier will take place. 

 However, Page also points out that once the occupation ends, the suicide terrorist attacks stop. In Lebanon, between 1982-86, there were 41 suicide attacks. But after the US withdrawal of its troops in 1986 there were none. Similarly, once Israel withdrew from southern Lebanon, Lebanese suicide attacks against Israeli troops or within Israel, stopped.

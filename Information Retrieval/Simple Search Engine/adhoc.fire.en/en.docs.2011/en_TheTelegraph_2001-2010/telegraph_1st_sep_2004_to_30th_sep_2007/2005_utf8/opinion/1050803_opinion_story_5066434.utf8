 KEEPING THE ARMS UNDER CONTROL

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the communique issued by the G8 nations at Gleneagles, July 8

 We will also help Africa prevent conflict and ensure that previous conflicts do not re-emerge, by:

 (a) Working in partnership with the African Union and sub-regional organizations, including by providing resources to develop their planned Continental Early Warning System and implement the AU Panel of the Wise to address and mediate conflicts before they erupt into violence.

 (b) Enhancing the capabilities of the AU and African sub-organizations, building on the existing G8 action plan for expanding global capability for peace support operations, as well as commitments from the Evian and Kananaskis Summits. To support this, we will work to promote within our respective government mechanisms for more effective and flexible crisis response and promote faster, more comprehensive and coordinated partner responses...

 (c) Maximizing the contribution of local and multinational companies to peace and stability, including through working with the UN Global Compact and developing OECD guidance for companies working in zones of weak governance.

 (d) Working to implement UN sanctions regimes more effectively by improved coordination of existing monitoring mechanisms and more efficient use of independent expertise.

 (e) Acting effectively in the UN and in other fora to combat the role played by ?conflict resources? such as oil, diamonds and timber, and other scarce natural resources, in starting and fuelling conflicts.

 (f) Improving the effectiveness of transfer controls over small arms and light weapons, including at inter alia the review conference of the UN Programme of Action on small arms and light weapons in 2006, and taking effective action in Africa to collect and destroy illicit small arms. Development of international standards in arms transfers, including a common understanding of governments? responsibilities, would be an important step towards tackling the undesirable proliferation of conventional arms. We agree on the need for further work to build a consensus for action to tackle the undesirable proliferation of conventional arms.

 (g) Working in support of the UN secretary general?s proposed new Peace Building Commission.

 11. We will give greater attention and resources to reconstruction by reconciliation in post-conflict countries by:

 (a) Providing rapid and flexible multilateral and bilateral debt relief for post conflict countries, where appropriate.

 (b) Allocating grant financing for reconstruction needs, including the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) into civilian society of former combatants.

 12. We will work urgently with other partners to improve the timeliness, predictability, effectiveness and availability of humanitarian assistance by:

 (a) Helping to fund sufficiently the urgent needs of millions of Africans caught up in the humanitarian emergencies identified by the UN in Africa, especially in the so-called ?forgotten humanitarian crisis?, so that coordinated emergency funding is available in time to save lives at risk.

 (b) Working with the UN to improve the tracking, reporting, and coordination of the resources provided for humanitarian emergencies.

 TO BE CONCLUDED

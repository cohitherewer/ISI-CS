 Letters to Editor

 Flying low

 Sir ? The roadblocks put up by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) cadre against the Indo-US joint exercise at the Kalaikunda airbase did cause some inconvenience to the people of the city. A few missed their flights, some children got late in coming home from school because their school buses were stuck in the blocked roads. But these, of course, were trivial compared to the larger issue of American hegemony which needed to be addressed. There is no doubt that the immense capacity of the left parties to mobilize people must be channelized towards worthwhile causes. But can futile demonstrations against the US-India air force exercises ? which are in compliance with a five-year-old international agreement ? serve any purpose? It is more important that this manpower is inspired to take up the task of nation-building in right earnest. Let the communist leadership motivate their cadre and supporters to increase production in farms and factories, to improve services in government offices, hospitals, transport, educational institutions, banks and so on. Else, they will not be forgiven for having misguided entire generations and letting the state go to the dogs.

 Yours faithfully,

Gautam Mookerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? Protests and demonstrations are routine in CPI(M) ranks, somewhat like religious rituals to the devout. The CPI(M)-sponsored protests in Kalaikunda and Calcutta not only cost the state a great deal of time and money, but also caused embarrassment to the invited guests from the United States of America. The comrades spared little thought for what the Indian air force stands to gain from the exercise. The CPI(M) has made the opposition of the US one of its guiding principles. And yet, most of our Marxist leaders send their children to the US for higher studies. Most of the Indian communists? actions reflect these double standards. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.K. Das, Calcutta

 Sir ? According to the report, ?They came, they saw amp; swooned?, (Nov 8 ) ?thousands... stood transfixed near the runway fencing as planes touched down at regular intervals.? The leaders had to rebuke the erring comrades. A Bengali news channel conducted a random survey among people in the protest march about why they there. Only one out of three could answer. One claimed he had joined the march to fight ?Matin imperialism? (?Markin?, the Bengali word for ?American? was perhaps alien to this villager), another said that he had come to strengthen the party, and a third one had to call a senior comrade to answer the question for him. The grand tamasha at the expense of the poor and ignorant people from suburban and rural Bengal surely cannot be said to reflect public opinion. What about the silent majority who preferred to stay at home?

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Temples of doom

 Sir ? Custodians of the Lingaraj temple in Bhubaneswar have done a great disservice to Hindu religion by denying entry to the American woman who had recently converted to Hinduism. This will certainly discourage non-Hindus from embracing Hinduism. And how can temple authorities identify a non-Hindu if he or she happens to be non-white?

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir ? Until I made a visit to the temple of Lord Jagannath in Puri, I was under the impression that all are equal in the eyes of god. But a board at the temple entrance explicitly stated ?Only Hindus are allowed?. I failed to understand how a non-Hindu could be debarred from entering a temple? But there was more. Inside the temple, anybody could have a darshan of the main deity from a distance of, say, 25 metres. But on buying a special ticket for Rs 20, one could have the privilege of almost touching the deity. So money does indeed increase one?s proximity to god?

 Yours faithfully,

Ajay Modi, Dhenkanal

 Sir ? It is disheartening that foreigners are still not allowed to enter some Indian temples. The Lingaraj temple is one of the most famous temples in the country, and by denying entry to an American lady of indian origin, the temple authorities have tarnished the secular image of India. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

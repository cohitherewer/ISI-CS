 DIARY

 Mama mia! It?ll be a year in office for the Congress next month, and time to take stock of the brood. Madam is supposed to have started the procedure already and is quite alarmed at the way the grown-ups are conducting themselves. The home minister first. The day the tourist centre in Srinagar went up in flames on the eve of the bus ride to Muzaffarabad, Sonia apparently sought an explanation from her boys. She was told that Shivraj Patil had spent almost a week touring Nathula Pass and other parts of the North-east when he was supposed to monitor developments in Kashmir on an hourly basis. The reaction was swift. Patil did not figure in the high-profile Congress team that visited Srinagar the following day. The other problem child seems to be the defence minister, who seems to be clueless about his ministry?s presenting of the crucial affidavit before the Supreme Court which gave a virtual clean chit to George Fernandes. It was supposedly a crucial phone call from madam?s political secretary, Ahmad Patel, which prompted Mukherjeeda to change tack and promise that a supplementary affidavit was on its way. There are already proddings from partymen to change portfolios, and Arjun Singh seems a popular choice. But that wouldn?t be such a mature thing to do, would it madam? 

 Politicians and bureaucrats were always good at brokering deals, but in Orissa, journos don?t seem to be doing badly either. A local scribe, who takes himself a little too seriously as the resident editor of an English daily from Bhubaneswar, is making the most of the rush to set up steel companies in the state. He reportedly went to Delhi to mediate in a deal with an Australian mining company, which would do the digging for a South Korean steel company interested in Orissa. Accompanying him to this highly confidential meeting was a select group of mandarins from the state, including the chief secretary. But isn?t it suicidal to have a scribe in such a meeting? Perhaps. But not if he is there to prove that the influential press in Orissa stands behind the government in its deals, and to assure the partners that the publicity would not be messed up. With Naveen Patnaik finding himself on a sticky wicket following two murky mining deals recently, the display was important. Expectedly, the newspaper concerned did not carry details of the meeting, which otherwise should have been an exclusive story.

 With chances of a comeback dimming, the saffronwallahs have donned a new role. They have become a party of stadium inspectors. While one gen-sec, Arun Jaitley, seems to have got busy monitoring the Ferozeshah Kotla stadium being readied for the cricket final, another team took on a similar responsibility elsewhere. Prior to the national council meet in New Delhi, party officials Pramod Mahajan and Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi paid numerous visit to the Ambedkar stadium to see things were alright. True karyakartas.

 A former infantryman, Major Ved Prakash Khatri once worked as PV Narasimha Rao?s eyes and ears at the party office. The Major rose to become AICC secretary assisting party spokespersons like VN Gadgil and Ajit Jogi. But it is hard times for Khatri now. When he approached the organizers of the Dandi march, Ashok Gehlot and Mukul Wasnik, expressing his willingness to participate, Khatri was apparently told that there was no free air ticket or accommodation. He had to proceed to Kashmir instead and help in the arrangements for the bus ride. Some 25,000 posters, banners and publicity material were given to him, together with a train ticket to Jammu. Thereafter, a bus would take him to the Valley. No free rides anymore, at least not for all.

 It?s different for people like Deepak Talwar, a Delhi-based liaison man-cum-lobbyist, who came into his own when his patron, AN Verma, called the shots in the Narasimha Rao government. Talwar did not disappear during the saffron regime. He discovered old school ties with someone who had the PM?s ears. With the return of the Congress, it?s business as usual again. He is supposed to have acquired an impressive array of clients, including Airbus Industries. Since the government is in the advanced stages of finalizing a multi-billion dollar deal to purchase scores of jets for both the national carriers, and the competition between the European and American rivals intense, the Talwars have naturally assumed supreme importance. Thanks to their persuasive skills and ability to straddle political camps, the sales pitch of the rival airliners is bound to get more shrill. 

 Nothing succeeds like success. Even for a guru. Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, spiritual anchor of the rich and famous, has stolen a march over his peers in healing troubled souls from Kanpur to Kosovo. Unknown to several others who are in the same trade, the guru?s foundation alone seems to have managed a feat of sorts. Central government employees are allowed to attend its courses or activities while tax-payers pick up the tab for them. About 90 per cent of the expenses for the babus are paid for by the government, while the participants pay the remaining 10 per cent. But more important, babus are allowed to participate in the course during office hours. 

 The circular providing for all this was issued by the Vajpayee government, and is very much in place. If anyone has questions about why the state should get into the sticky business of spiritualism, they can direct them to the avowedly secular UPA bosses.

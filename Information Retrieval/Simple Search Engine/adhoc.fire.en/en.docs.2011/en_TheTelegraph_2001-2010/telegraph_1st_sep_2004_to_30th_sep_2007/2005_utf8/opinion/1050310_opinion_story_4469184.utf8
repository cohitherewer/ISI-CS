 A PALER SHADE OF RED

 The CPI and CPI(M) continue to lose ground in Bihar and Jharkhand, while the CPI(M-L) makes new inroads, writes Sumanta Sen

 They also believe in Marx

 Of the many constants in the political scene in Bihar, and also Jharkhand ? such as casteism, corruption, lawlessness ? is the continuing decline of the Communist Party of India and the Communist Party of India (Marxist). The two parties just do not seem to be able to hold on to their positions, leave alone regain their earlier dominance over fairly large areas of the undivided state. Their pathetic condition stands out more in the context of the slow but steady rise of the CPI(M). Why is this so? Is it because the objective conditions do not suit the older communist parties, or is it that they have become victims of national considerations?

 First a quick look at the results now and five years ago. In the assembly elections of 2000, the two communist parties had got four seats, two each. This time too, their total remains four, the CPI getting three and the CPI(M) only one. The Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist), on the other hand, raised its tally from five to seven. In Jharkhand, the CPI and CPI(M) have drawn a blank, but the CPI(M-L) has not, and the Forward Bloc has opened its account. The result must have surprised the CPI, which had bagged the Hazaribagh Lok Sabha seat only last year, upstaging Yashwant Sinha. The fractured alliance in the assembly polls did not allow any piggy-back riding for the CPI. In Bihar, the CPI(M) lost the Bhagalpur Lok Sabha seat last year because of alliance problems at the grassroots level.

 The picture was brighter even two decades back. Then the CPI had no trouble winning around 40 seats in the Bihar assembly (Jharkhand was yet to be born). The much smaller CPI(M) also managed around seven or eight. Bihar was no less feudal then, but that did not stand in the way of progressive politics breaking through the age-old shackles. The CPI, in particular, had always been able to work out its own caste arithmetic. In the mid-Eighties, it would be commonly referred to as a ?Bhumihar party?, as many of its leaders belonged to that community. Caste and class considerations did not seem to run counter to one another then. The CPI did have problems following its support of the Congress during the Emergency, but was later able to retrieve some of it. The CPI(M), on the other hand, could have strengthened itself before the Emergency, but failed to do so because its suspicions about Jayaprakash Narayan?s movement did not go down well with the masses.

 What, however, took both parties aback was V.P. Singh?s use of the Mandal report. Almost overnight, the division along caste lines became all-important. The two parties did not know which way to turn as naturally they did not represent any particular caste. Both clung to the then Janata Dal, but it was not easy. One recalls the frustration in the voice of veteran CPI leader, Jagannath Sarkar, when the question of seat-sharing came up for the 1990 assembly elections ? ?How do you deal with somebody like Laloo who thinks only of caste when determining areas of influence?? This had led Indrajit Gupta to suggest that the communists see caste divisions as essentially class divisions and proceed accordingly. But how could the left view rich landlords as class allies simply because they were Yadavs or Kurmis?

 Even then, in a state where economic and also physical oppression is more than common, the two parties could have emerged as centres of protest but for the gradual surrender to Laloo Yadav. The state unit of the CPI(M) had its reservations about this, and tried to organize the small and marginal farmers as also the landless, but they were invariably stopped by the powers that be. The CPI initially had a love-hate relation with Laloo Yadav, but veered round to him finally, as the latter emerged as the messiah of secularism, which had to be defended at all costs. Strangely enough, the communist leaders did not seem to realize that communalism is not half as big a problem in Bihar as caste domination. 

 So the party which has made its presence felt in rural Bihar is the CPI(M-L). Painstakingly, it has been able to convince the people that there is no solace to be found either with the Rashtriya Janata Dal or with the Bharatiya Janata Party-Janata Dal (United), the Congress or any such party as all have the same class interest. The CPI and CPI(M) also agree with the message, but ?national compulsions? force them to be identified with the RJD which sees them as allies easy to satisfy with a few crumbs from the high table. 

 In Jharkhand it has been a different problem. The state was born out of a long ethnic struggle and the communists are never comfortable with this, as has been seen in Assam. Tripura was different, for the tribals? armed struggle was primarily along class lines. So while the Jharkhandis fought their battle and even the BJP and the Congress lent their support, the communists remained isolated. That their isolation persists is there for all to see.

 This neither-here-nor-there situation has also led to organizational problems. In the name of discipline, the Bihar unit of the CPI(M), in particular, has expelled more members than it has been able to take in. These problems would probably not have arisen had the political line been less confused. Will the problem be addressed in the approaching congress of the two parties in Delhi and Chandigarh?

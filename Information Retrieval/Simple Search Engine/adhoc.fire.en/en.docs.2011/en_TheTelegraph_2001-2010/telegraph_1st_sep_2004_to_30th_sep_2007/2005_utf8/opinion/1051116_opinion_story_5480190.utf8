 TO BREAK THE CYCLE OF DEPRIVATION

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the Human Development Report 2005

 Exercises such as these describe what outcomes are possible. Working towards these outcomes will require new directions in public policy. Far more weight should be attached to improving the availability, accessibility and affordability of public services and to increasing poor people rsquo;s share of the growth. There is no single blueprint for achieving improved outcomes on income distribution. For many countries, especial in sub-Saharan Africa, measures are needed to unlock the productive potential of smallholder agriculture and rural areas. More universally, education is one of the keys to greater equity. Socially transformative fiscal policies that provide security and equip the poor with the assets needed to escape poverty are also vital. 

 None of this implies that achieving greater equity in human development is easy. Extreme inequalities are rooted in power structures that deprive poor people of market opportunities, limit their access to services and ? crucially ?deny them a political voice. These pathologies of power are bad for development and political stability...

 International aid is one of the most effective weapons in the war against poverty. Today, that weapon is underused, inefficiently targeted and in need of repair. Reforming the international aid system is a fundamental requirement for getting back on track for the millennium development goals.

 Aid is sometimes thought of as a one-way act of charity. That view is misplaced. In a world of interconnected threats and opportunities, aid is an investment as well as a moral imperative...Failure to invest on a sufficient scale will generate costs tomorrow.

 Development assistance is at the heart of the new partnership for development set out in the Millennium Declaration. As in any partnership, there are responsibilities and obligations on both sides. Developing countries have a responsibility to create an environment in which aid can yield optimal results. Rich countries have an obligation to act on their commitments.

 There are three conditions for effective aid. First, it has to be delivered in sufficient quantity to support human development take-off. Aid provides governments with a resource for making the multiple investments in health, education and economic infrastructure needed to break cycles of deprivation and support economic recovery ? and the resource needs to be commensurate with the scale of the financing gap. Second, aid has to be delivered on a predictable, low transaction cost, value for money basis. Third, effective aid requires ?country ownership?. Developing countries have primary responsibility for creating the conditions under which aid can yield results. 

 When the Millennium Declaration was signed, the development assistance glass was three-quarters empty ? and leaking. During the Nineties aid budgets were subject top deep cuts, with per capita assistance to sub-Saharan Africa falling by one-third. Today, the aid financing glass is approaching half full. Rich countries now spend 0.25per cent of their gross national income on aid. The European Union?s commitment to reach a 0.51per cent threshold by 2010 is especially encouraging.

 However, even if projected increases are delivered in full, there remains a large aid shortfall that will increase from $46 billion in 2006 to $52 billion in 2010. Failure to close the financing gap through an increase in aid will prevent governments from making the investments needed to improve welfare and support economic recovery on the scale required to achieve the millennium development goals.

 DIARY

 If power has its perks, it has its drawbacks too. Randeep Surjewala is ruing the day he took over as working president of the Congress?s Haryana unit. With assembly elections looming in February, ticket-seekers are stalking him everywhere, from Khan Market to all the fancy joints in the national capital he used to haunt as Youth Congress chief. Surjewala can?t pick up his mobile, because the tech-savvy Haryanvis are MMS-ing him their mugs so that he remembers them when distributing tickets. He can?t relax at home because it is besieged by ticket-seekers. If his tastes were less refined, Surjewala might have been happy at being pursued. The other day, Surjewala went into a hotel to have a meal. But as luck would have it, the waiter who served him tea turned out to have a country cousin who wanted a Congress ticket, and so passed on a chit asking whether he would be considered. Exasperated, Surjewala got up and left, shooting off obscenities. The beleaguered leader even carried his tale of woe to Arjun Singh but the senior partyman was not very sympathetic ? you should be happy because this means that the Congress is on the road to victory. No one had told Surjewala that the road was paved with so many ticket-seekers. 

 Laloo Prasad Yadav has been having something of a dream run lately, but Congress leaders are hoping that the coming assembly elections will be a rude awakening. They are hoping hard that those opposed to Yadav in Bihar get their act together so that he doesn?t come to power three times in a row. For Laloo, who is already a handful for the Manmohan Singh government, would then be quite unmanageable. In comparison, any opposition government would be a piece of cake. Obviously, the UPA wants to have its cake and eat it too.

 Om Prakash Chautala is a very hurt man these days. He can?t fathom why the BJP wants to go it alone in the coming assembly elections in Haryana. It?s a sure recipe for defeat, with the Congress on a resurgence. The only reason for such intransigence, he feels, must be LK Advani?s hostility towards him or perhaps the BJP president had been ill advised by his confidantes. For he had excellent relations with Atal Bihari Vajpayee and even his detractors like the Akali Dal?s Parkash Singh Badal and the BJP?s own Madanlal Khurana had pleaded for an INLD-BJP alliance. Chautala dismisses outright all suggestions that the BJP?s decision to sever ties with its former ally has anything to do with ?corruption?. After all, the saffron party didn?t have any qualms joining hands with Sukh Ram and Buta Singh to come to power at the Centre. Undaunted, the Haryana CM is exploring a tie-up with Mayavati?s BSP, which has pockets of support in all 90 constituencies in the state. Better luck to him.

 Someone Lady Luck seems to be shining down on is Pranab Mukherjee. By every reckoning, he is successor to Manmohan Singh, should the latter decide, one fine day, to pack his bags and leave the murky world of politics. As it is, he presides over cabinet meetings in Singh?s absence. He chaired the emergency meeting called after the tsunami, and it was he who formed the group of ministers to oversee relief operations. And when Sonia Gandhi chose to visit the affected areas, she took along with her not the prime minister but the leader of her party in the Lok Sabha, the party unit chief in West Bengal and the in-charge of Punjab. For those who can read them, the signals are loud and clear. 

 Life, if you belong to the Trinamool Congress, is a series of questions. Do you stick with Mamata Banerjee or switch to the Congress? And if you do switch, how, without provoking didi? Subrata Mukherjee feels the burden of the questions most. Having spent the last 27 years in the opposition, next year?s assembly elections may well be his last shot at Writers? Buildings. He has thus started talking to state and Central Congress big-wigs, opening up a channel of communication with Sonia Gandhi. Inevitably, reports of these talks have reached Mamata who isn?t amused. She is, reportedly, loath to let the wily mayor beat her to the parent party and bag all the plum posts. She has come up with a device to scuttle Mukherjee?s defection plans: put him in charge of handling the Calcutta municipality elections later this year. Meanwhile Mamata?s own talks with the Congress are progressing apace, causing some discomfort to her erstwhile rivals in the state Congress.

 Peace always come at a price. Now that LK Advani has made up with Uma Bharti, Govindacharya and the RSS pracharaks of Keshav Kunj, he has invited upon himself the wrath of all those Bharti had angered. Pramod Mahajan, whom Bharti had accused of scuttling her tiranga yatra, is especially irked at the way the sanyasin was taken back, without so much as an apology for her open defiance. He hasn?t been attending party meetings, and even skipped the recent sitting of the BJP parliamentary board. Worried, Advani called him up since he is the party?s main fund-raiser during elections. But, reportedly, Mahajan was not appeased by the gesture. You have nothing to worry about, he is supposed to have told his party president, now that Umaji is back. She will manage everything. She is a mass leader and will get the party elected in all three states. Sarcasm, Mahajan should know, is wonderful release for frustration, but it gets you nowhere.

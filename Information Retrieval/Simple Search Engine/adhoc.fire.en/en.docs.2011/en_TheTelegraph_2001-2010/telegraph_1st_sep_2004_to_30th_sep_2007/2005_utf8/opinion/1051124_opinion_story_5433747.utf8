 LESSONS NOT LEARNT

 Asokendu sengupta

 The organization of training programmes for teachers on how to cope with the demands of students have become a dime a dozen in India. Teachers are expected to be honest, sincere, sensitive, selfless and so on. Since independence, teachers have often demanded a hike in payment and the government has responded positively. 

 In the last twenty years, the pay scale of college teachers has nearly doubled. But the state which provides the funds also demands certain things in return. Whenever a hike in payment is announced, the University Grants Commission prescribes new rules for the evaluation of teachers.

 The UGC wants to make teachers accountable, and for valid reasons too. But such proposals are not taken seriously as the schemes are often riddled with flaws. Teachers are answerable to various agencies ? from college principals to the Central government. Often, these authorities work at cross-purposes, and the net result, as far as instituting a format for evaluation is concerned, is a big zero. 

 French leave

 There is hardly any attempt to improve academic conditions for the benefit of teachers, as well as educational institutions. Ultimately, misconceptions of the authorities nullify chances of improvement. The situation worsens when unscrupulous politicians interfere, striving to protect their petty interests. After all, politicians are the real bosses, so those entrusted with the execution of the scheme end up following the diktat of the party. 

 In the last pay revision proposal, teachers were asked to devote forty hours per week to institutions. It would go a long way in benefiting students and institutions if quality time was spent in imparting quality education. But most colleges do not have enough space to hold extra classes. There are no libraries or laboratories, no reading rooms and no space for teacher-student interaction. Teachers are packed inside a common room, where the atmosphere is not conducive to scholastic deliberations. 

 Teachers do not stay for forty hours, but the records show otherwise. The shirkers used their tricks to bend rules. The UGC and other regulatory bodies, ignorant of such mischief, study record books and declare their system to be a success. Unfortunately, even serious teachers, in order to avoid falling out with their bosses, give false statements. 

 Stuck in red tape

 But many teachers do love to spend time with students. A cubicle with a table, an almirah and a few chairs are all that they want. That would hardly cost much. But funds are not as big a problem as the attitude. A proposal to the R.K. Poddar Committee regarding this was ignored. 

 Most colleges cannot provide separate cubicles for all teachers. Moreover, bureaucrats in charge of educational planning consider such measures as a luxury for teachers who, they argue, enjoy paid vacations. Little do they realize that these are not paid holidays, but an essential part of a teacher?s preparations.

 Most bureaucrats have little knowledge about teaching as a profession. Neither do they have any experience in organizing workshops. The officials treat the education department as a waiting room as they scout for better options in other departments. Not only do they fail to implement any plan effectively, they also block input channels, making improvement impossible. 

 Unfortunately, teachers continue to enjoy a special position in society. Many of them take advantage of the poor management to weaken the standards of higher education further. Perhaps, a separate educational management cadre on the lines of the civil services is necessary to turn things around in education.

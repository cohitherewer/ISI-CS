 Letters to Editor

 No show

 Sir ? If the overwhelming victory of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in the recent parliamentary by-election at Asansol is any indication of left resurgence, Mamata Banerjee should have desisted from resorting to her gimmicks on the occasion of the Benny Santoso visit. When left leaders seem hellbent on transforming West Bengal, Banerjee should appear to come forward to contribute to this economic revival. She was even invited to the negotiation table where she could have bargained to protect the interests of farmers. Instead she preferred to stage her cheap public show. The failed agitation will not refurbish her image nor will it serve the purpose of those who will lose their land. The thin presence of her own supporters on the road showed that her programme has no moral support within her own party (?Blame on rain for damp squib?, Oct 21). 

 On the other hand, Anil Biswas?s comment, that the unhindered journey of Santoso showed a popular rejection of the rasta roko, does not hold. For he knows, as no one else would, that the people of this state are puppets in the hands of the left. If people?s ?acceptance? or ?rejection? had borne some weight, the administration would not have made the arrangements to spoil Banerjee?s show. Again, had similar arrangements been made on the bandh of September 29, called against the wishes of the people, an industrial strike would not have taken the appearance of a general strike. 

Yours faithfully, 

Subhankar Mukherjee, Borehat, Burdwan 

 Sir ? The report, ?Benny hits town, boys desert Didi? (Oct 21), presents the Trinamool farce in a gripping manner. Hats off to Calcutta?s police bosses who managed to outwit the demonstrators trying to block Benny Santoso?s way. Didi may blame the rains for spoiling her show this time, but will she have an excuse for a non-performance next time? The proposed two-wheeler factory would be set up in 21 months? time. Will that give her time for another trick?

 Yours faithfully,

Zeeshan Roohullah, Calcutta

 Sir ? With her moles everywhere, it is hard to believe that didi had no inkling of the duplicate schedule for Benny Santoso. One would tend to believe that she played ball because she realized the fallacy of her game. Her ?didigiri? on the streets is no longer relevant.

 Yours faithfully,

Amajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir ? Reservations in three different hotels, arrival three hours before schedule, a choice of three different routes, three days of elaborate planning to stall a three-hour agitation, and all for the handover of a Rs 3 crore cheque. It seems Mamata Banerjee is still a force to reckon with, at least in the minds of the left leaders. Ideally, the schedule for Benny Santoso which was made public should have been adhered to, and Banerjee and her boys allowed to hold peaceful demonstrations. Yes, the government was free to use force had the demonstrations turned violent. That would have sent two distinct signals to the business community from outside the country. One, that we respect democratic rights. And two, that no one would be spared if he tried to block an important development project. Banerjee?s fizzled out demonstration plans cannot be a reason to feel happy. What about future demonstrations? On the other hand, think of Benny Santoso. Why should he have to enter a city where he is investing a huge amount like a thief? 

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

 Sir ? The editorial, ?Past lady? (Oct 19), made a superb assessment of Trinamool politics. The ascendancy of Mamata Banerjee and her pivotal role in the shaping of a political formation in the state, point to the unsavoury aspects of a political culture that has struck deep roots here. The majority believes that didi has been arrogant and that her Trinamool is a law unto itself. Her latest mode of protest, by threatening to unleash terror, seems to confirm that belief. But if she wants to come back again to the political minefield that is Bengal, she should not be hell-bent on harming the state where development must be the first and foremost concern for all. Perhaps Mamata Banerjee has to think over her strategy from scratch.

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad

 Sir ? Much as we may disapprove of her ways, Mamata Banerjee is Bengal?s last hope. We cannot say for sure that the state is already on its way to economic recovery. One only has to look at states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka and Punjab to see that Bengal still belongs to the lowest rung of development and can be bracketed only with Bihar in development. Be it Banerjee?s intimidation or the left?s, the atmosphere here is not conducive for any kind of growth.

 Yours faithfully,

Gautam Mookerjee, Pune

 Sir ? The antecedents of the Salim group continues to raise uncomfortable questions. But the CPI(M) has brushed them under the carpet. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, after returning from Indonesia, had said that all that was necessary was a cat?s ability to kill mice. Its colour did not matter. The communists sometimes forget that they are not capitalists. Why choose a group that is controversial in its own country? Besides, what is the compensation being paid to farmers? A pittance. The same land is being sold to industrialists at four times the price. That goes into the government coffers to pay the salary of the ruling party cadre. 

 Yours faithfully,

Pradip Chowdhury, Calcutta

 Sir ? The much publicized Salim group?s investment in West Bengal has so far resulted in a motorcycle factory at an investment of Rs 250 crore only. Compare this with Posco?s investment in Orissa to the tune of Rs 39,000 crore and Mittals? investment of Rs 40,000 in Jharkhand. B.C. Roy was successful in attracting thousands of crore for industrial projects, most of which are either dead or are dying under the Marxist rule.

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

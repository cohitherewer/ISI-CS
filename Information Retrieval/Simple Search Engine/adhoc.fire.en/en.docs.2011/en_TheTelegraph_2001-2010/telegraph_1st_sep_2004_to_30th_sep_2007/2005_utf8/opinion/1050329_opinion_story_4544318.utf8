 SWEET NOTHINGS

 Beware of Uncle Sam when he comes bearing gifts. This warning applies both to India and to Pakistan. The latter is buying F-16 aircraft from the United States of America despite having burnt its fingers before. The US?s decision to sell F-16s to Pakistan has not won approval in India. To sweeten the pill, the US has offered to India the licensed production of F-16s and F-18s. India would do well to avoid this very well-meaning trap. The US is notoriously unreliable as a supplier of military hardware, as Pakistan has learnt to its cost. In its wisdom or from an absence of choice, Pakistan, although once bitten, is not being twice shy. But that is not good enough reason for India to be bitten too, especially as there are other ways of beefing up the Indian air force. The unreliability of the US is underlined by the fact that during the visit of the US secretary of state, Ms Condoleeza Rice, there was no indication that the sale of F-16s to Pakistan would be announced so soon. The F-16s to Pakistan have been balanced, in the eyes of the US, by a clutch of sweet promises to India.

 This disproportionate bestowing of gifts should not also be blown out of perspective and jeremiahed into an anti-US rhetoric. The estrangement of the Cold-War era has changed to engagement at the level of diplomacy and in the military field. The Indian and the US navies carry out joint exercises and combined operations. The armies of the two countries are cooperating in high-altitude training and disaster management, while the two air forces are working out plans to take part in joint search-and-rescue missions. Washington and New Delhi are cooperating quietly on various aspects of national missile defence and are sharing information on terrorists and terrorist organizations. There is the promise now of an agreement on civilian nuclear activities.

 There is no gainsaying the fact that in many critical areas, India and the US have come together and formed reciprocal arrangements. But this cannot take away from the profound and fundamental contradictions that inform Indo-US relations. Foreign policy is always based on the perception of self-interest and on its advancement. India?s self-interest clearly lies in emerging as the most important player in south Asia and in the Indian Ocean. It also sees itself as a key player in Asian affairs. It is not in the US?s interest to see India play such a powerful role in the region. It would like India to be subservient to its own interests and plans. Its nurturing of Pakistan is designed to make it a counter-balance to India. This is a contradiction unlikely to be resolved. Given this, India should be choosy about what it decides to take from the US, and more importantly, it should resist the temptation of being seduced by sweet nothings.

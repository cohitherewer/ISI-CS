 Not entirely human

 Sir ? That human development in India has been deplorable is not news. The recent United Nations human development report of 2005 just reinforces the fact (??Human face? ugly as ever?, Sept 8). It is shocking to see India stranded at the 127th position in the human development index when its economic growth is so remarkable. The World Bank ranked India as having the 10th highest GDP in the world, and yet there is no reflection of that in the living conditions of its people. What is happening to all the wealth in India? This question assumes even greater significance when one looks at China, another high-flier, but one that has improved on its human development ranking by 20 per cent since 1990 and presently ranks 85th on the report. Indian policy-makers need to learn from countries like Bangladesh, which is one of the poorest in the world, but has come to value its human resources and has made radical progress in education, income and life expectancy.

 Within our own borders we see a a contrasting picture, with states like Gujarat and Tamil Nadu having considerably cut down on rural poverty while West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar still grappling with the problem. There is also reason to cheer the education sector in which states like Tamil Nadu and Kerala have managed considerable growth through increased budgets, accountability of service providers and incentives such as scholarships and free textbooks. The majority of states in India, however, are way behind. 

 Manmohan Singh went on record in April this year on a foreign news channel, conceding that public health had received ?inadequate attention?. Perhaps many others have done the same before him. Sadly, such words have seldom been followed by action. The UNDP report rightly points out that India needs to implement public policies designed to broaden the distribution of economic benefits among its masses, increase public investment in rural areas along with infrastructure development and most importantly, a robust political leadership committed to good governance. India has to replicate its regional and state-level success stories on the national front if it expects its ?human face? to shed its ugly look.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The UNDP report is a commentary on the country?s dismal performance in human resource (?Brutal figures?, Sept 9). If the national common minimum programme is allowed to materialize, the left willing, India will go a long way in realizing its millennium development goals. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Sir ? Our overenthusiastic government may be dismissive about the truths that the UNDP report presents, but it has to accept responsibility for India?s lopsided growth. Urban India may indeed be developing but rural India is surely not. Away from the media hype about an affluent India, the child mortality rate is increasing, the education percentile going down, and living standards deteriorating all over the country. In practical terms, the good effects of privatization, globalization and disinvestments are going to India?s rich. It is a revelation that India, supposed to be one of the fastest developing economies in the world, should hold such a record in human development. With such a performance, how do we achieve the target of becoming an economic superpower by 2020? And on what basis should we beg for a permanent member-seat in the security council?

Yours faithfully, 

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur 

 Sir ? India has not changed, the UNDP report is proof of that, despite the government of the aam aadmi being in power. Quite naturally, the planning commission?s study on mid-term appraisal remains unpublished since even there India would have had nothing to show by way of achievement. West Bengal?s case is particularly distressing since this is where a pro-poor government has been in power for close to three decades. India will definitely fail to realize the millennium development goals, because inside the country there is no intention to control corruption, promote a vibrant judiciary, inhibit population growth or the surge of criminality in politics, to control the disarray in health and education, and allow minority opinion to find a voice. Little wonder decisions on the women?s reservation bill, BHEL and other crucial issues remain in a limbo. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? India has joined the space club and plans to go to the moon. Yet it cannot feed and take care of its own children ? the wonder that is India. We have to admit that Namibia gives more priority to the welfare of its citizens than India. It is a pity that India falls even way behind Bangladesh in the child mortality rate. The figures raise fundamental questions about our humanity.

 Yours faithfully,

Sujit De, Sodepur

 Sir ? The brutal figures on the UNDP report does not surprise. Could it have been any different when the government thinks it more important to spend five million dollars on Americans than on its children, dying like cats and dogs from encephalitis? And what can you expect from a government that prefers to spend its precious money on haggling over Kashmir or over nuclear and space research than on its poor? India?s yearning for technological advance has always suppressed the more immediate need to rescue people from the vicious cycle of malnutrition, poverty and illiteracy. But thanks to our modern leaders, we continue to ignore the more pressing needs.

 Yours faithfully,

Kajal Chatterjee, Sodepur

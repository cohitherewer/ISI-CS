 NO FIRM POLICY

 The makers of India?s foreign policy are congenitally confused about what should be India?s role in the neighbourhood. India?s policy towards the neighbouring nations oscillates between playing the patronizing big brother to being the kindly neighbourhood country bending over backwards to please and placate. While it is clear that Mr Manmohan Singh has a well chalked out path for the Indian economy ? and this road-map he drew up when he was finance minister under P.V. Narasimha Rao ? as prime minister, he is yet to provide his own individual imprint to India?s foreign policy, at least that part of it which relates to the neighbours. One reason for this is obvious. India?s policy towards its neighbours cannot be determined by what has been called the ?Nehruvian vision?. For one thing, the nature of the problems has undergone a complete transformation from the time of Jawaharlal Nehru. Issues, interests and forces unknown to the first architect of India?s foreign policy have now emerged, and they demand a consistent response from the Indian side. Unfortunately, it is difficult to use the word consistent to describe India?s policy towards Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh.

 All these three countries have internal problems which directly affect India. The rise of Islamic fundamentalism in Pakistan and Bangladesh is of concern to India. India has good grounds to suspect that if Pakistan has sponsored terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir, then militants from north-east India find a haven in Bangladesh. There is also the added dimension of illegal immigration from Bangladesh into West Bengal. The declaration of emergency in Nepal by the king goes against one of the fundamental principles that India stands for ? democracy. To none of these problems has India responded as a country of India?s size and economic strength should have. Homilies about peace cannot be allowed to substitute realpolitik, which is the bedrock of foreign policy. Mr Singh?s government has failed to instil the confidence that India is getting the better of the ongoing dialogue between India and Pakistan. To both Nepal and Bangladesh, India has played the patronizing big brother without ever showing that it can also act tough. ?Love thy neighbour? reads well in the holy book, but can hardly be the pole star of foreign policy.

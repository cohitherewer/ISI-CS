 DELEGATION IS THE KEY 

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the government of India?s status report on Disaster Management in India, August 2004 

 The country has an integrated administrative machinery for management of disasters at the National, State, District and Sub-District levels. The basic responsibility of undertaking rescue, relief and rehabilitation measures in the event of natural disasters, as at present, is that of the State Governments concerned. The Central Government supplements the efforts of the States by providing financial and logistic support.

 The dimensions of response at the level of the Central Government are determined in accordance with the existing policy of financing relief expenditure and keeping in view the factors like:

 (i) the gravity of a natural disaster;

 (ii) the scale of the relief operation necessary; and

 (iii) the requirements of Central assistance for augmenting financial resources and logistic support at the disposal of the State Government....

 The Ministry of Home Affairs is the nodal Ministry for coordination of relief and response and overall natural disaster management, and the Department of Agriculture amp; Cooperation is the nodal Ministry for drought management. Other Ministries are assigned the responsibility of providing emergency support in case of disasters that fall in their purview...

 The following decision-making and standing bodies are responsible for disaster management at the Central level:

 ? Union Cabinet, headed by the Prime Minister.

 ? Empowered Group of Ministers, headed by the Deputy Prime Minister

 ? National Crisis Management Committee, under the chairmanship of the Cabinet Secretary.

 ? Crisis Management Group: under the chairmanship of the Central Relief Commissioner comprising senior officers from the various Ministries and other concerned Departments which reviews contingency plans, measures required for dealing with a natural disaster, and co-ordinates the activities of the Central Ministries and the State Governments in relation to disaster preparedness response and relief.

 ? Technical Organizations, such as the Indian Meteorological Department (cyclone/earthquake), Central Water Commission (floods), Building and Material Promotion Council (construction laws), Bureau of Indian Standards (norms), Defence Research amp; Development Organization (nuclear/biological), Directorate General Civil Defence, provide specific technical support to coordination of disaster response and management functions.

 ? The setting up of a National Disaster Management Authority is being contemplated by the Ministry of Home Affairs as the proposed apex structure within the government for the purpose. Amongst other major organizational initiatives, it is proposed to:

 (a) establish a specialised and earmarked response team for dealing with nuclear/biological/ chemical disasters;

 (b) establish search and rescue teams in each State;

 (c) strengthen communication systems in the Northeastern Region. 

 The responsibility to cope with natural disasters is essentially that of the State Government. The role of the Central Government is supportive in terms of supplementation of physical and financial resources. The Chief Secretary of the State heads a state level committee which is in overall charge of the relief operations in the State and the Relief Commissioners who are in charge of the relief and rehabilitation measures in the wake of natural disasters in their States function under the overall direction and control of the state level committee. 

 In many states, Secretary, Department of Revenue, is also in-charge of relief. State Governments usually have relief manuals and the districts have their contingency plan that is updated from time to time.

 Letters to Editor

 As Indian as it gets

 Sir ? If ?Not all can be ?Indian? (Nov 26), to comply with Section 3 of the Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act 1950, then a few questions must arise. The government?s move is reactive rather than pre-emptive. That it does not patronize private ?Indian? institutions is pretty clear from their fee structure. The question is, can the government take away the ?Indian? tag after a valid registration with its own agencies? Will names like Indian Express also come within the purview of the act? This looks destined to be a futile exercise, but a ceiling on the high fees of private institutions might not be a bad idea.

 Yours faithfully,

 Bidyut Datta, Calcutta

 Big blow

 Sir ? Amitabh Bachchan is paying a heavy price for his larger than life image (?Big B in belly bother? Nov 29). Even in his illness, each move of his is being monitored by the media. At 63, he is at the pinnacle of his career and it is understandable that for the entire film and television industry (not to mention his endorsement contracts), a lot is at stake. Which is why it is a great relief to know, if reports are to be believed, that Bachchan?s ailment is not too grave. 

 It is commendable that the superstar works harder at 63 than stars less than half his age. But that has inevitably taken a toll on his health. But now, he has no option but to follow the strict regime of rest set by his doctors. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bipasha Lahiri, Hyderabad

 Sir ? The recent ailment of the mega star, Amitabh Bachchan, has been blown out of proportion by the media (?Long live the king? Nov 29). A yajna was performed in Calcutta to ensure that he recovers soon; some schools are even organizing prayer camps. Although all Indians are unanimous in wishing him a speedy recovery, one is surprised to see the extensive coverage given to his illness by private television channels. Is this one more ploy to raise the TRP ratings of the channels? If so, it amounts to showing disrespect to the star and can only set a bad precedent in the long run. It is unfortunate that in the list of headlines, Big B?s tummy ache comes ahead of the flood in Tamil Nadu.

 Yours faithfully,

R. Sekar, Orissa

 Sir ? The anguish and concern expressed by millions of Indians at Amitabh Bachchan?s hospitalization, the extensive media coverage and the prayer meetings held throughout the country only indicate the enormous adulation and following the superstar still commands. India needs sagacious, benevolent and towering personalities like Bachchan to be around to steer their countrymen to the path of sincerity and dedicated service to the nation. There is no doubt that Amitabh Bachchan will be up and about in a matter of a few days.

 Yours faithfully,

S.C. Kapoor, Noida

 Parting shot

 Sir ? Being new to Calcutta, I was shocked by the indifference of the people to issues that directly affect them. In the city recently, I had visited a multiplex (Inox Forum) and found the establishment charging double the maximum retail price for bottled water (Rs 15 for MRP Rs 7). On hearing of a similar practice in Chennai, the Consumer Forum of the city had passed a verdict that no establishment (including five-star hotels) can charge more than the MRP price on bottled water. I was angry to see the multiplexes in Calcutta getting away with the same crime in the name of establishment cost. How is it that Calcuttans, who take up cudgels at the slightest whiff of a ?cause?, have not even bothered to ask for an explanation? Surely the people of the city have heard of consumer courts?

 Yours faithfully,

Zenobon Gogoi, Guwahati

 CITY OF STUMPS

 The secret of survival is getting noticed. Large, old, beautiful trees in Calcutta were presumably getting used to being lopped or felled, randomly as well as systematically. Some citizens would protest. But given their powerlessness in the municipal hierarchy, nothing much would come of these protests. Roads get widened, flyovers constructed, new buildings come up and the city ?develops?, while trees are unthinkingly cut down and sold at high, usually private, profit ? until the chief minister happened to notice what was going on. In this case, the trees had been lopped to let a huge rath pass unimpeded down the street. An angry chief minister immediately contacted the new mayor, who happened to be fairly clueless about the fate of trees in the city. But a top-level political and bureaucratic drama had been initiated, and various civic and governmental bodies, departments and committees, and their respective chains of being, had been galvanized into accountability. It has now become an important matter, and all kinds of administrative and legal failings have suddenly swum into the state?s consciousness.

 Yet this approach to conserving the city?s greens is just as arbitrary and ?uncivic? as the manner in which this green is being destroyed. Felling trees this way is callous and corrupt, and this top-down, bureaucratic approach to curbing this practice cannot be a long-term solution to the problem. Environmental awareness is a more comprehensive mindset that must be shared by citizens and the civic authorities alike, and at every level of the civic and political hierarchies. The saddest and the most dangerous aspect of urban development in Calcutta is the absence of such a civic consensus. At the topmost political level, there is a complete lack of vision. Chief ministers, mayors, ministers and important committee or council members are led in their actions by impulses that spring from anything, from angry or sentimental outbursts to private greed and ignorance. Conservation cannot be sustained by fits of chief ministerial passion. It requires a refashioning of civic attitudes and habits, as well as concerted legal, municipal and bureaucratic action and reform, bringing about different systems of accountability and awareness.

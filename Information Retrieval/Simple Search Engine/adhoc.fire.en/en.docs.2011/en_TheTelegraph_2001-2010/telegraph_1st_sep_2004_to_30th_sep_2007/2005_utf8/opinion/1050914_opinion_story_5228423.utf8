 WINNER TAKES ALL

 Gwynne Dyer

 If we set out to create a farm in the wilderness, we should not expect the top local predators to help. We have our interests, and they have theirs: as our little patch of order spreads, their ability to hunt freely and dominate the local environment will be increasingly constrained. So we should not be surprised that John Bolton is trying to sabotage the reform of the United Nations.

 The US ambassador to the UN believes that if the UN is not an instrument of American power, then it is an obstacle to the free exercise of American power. He and his neo-conservative colleagues are deeply traditional men and women who see world politics as a zero-sum game in which there are only winners and losers, and they believe that America?s best chance of remaining a winner is to preserve the world as a free-fire zone for the exercise of US military and economic power.

 Sweeping changes

 That is why Bolton entered over 400 objections to the draft agreement on the changes that are needed to make the UN relevant to the 21st century. About 175 heads of state and heads of government are in New York to mark the UN?s 60th anniversary and approve the landmark document that has been under negotiation for the past year, but the US intervention has re-opened many issues that were all but settled and it is doubtful that there will even be a final document.

 Bolton demanded that all references to climate change be removed, and likewise all references to wealthy countries like the US committing to a goal of 0.7 per cent of their GDP in foreign aid. There was to be no special help for developing countries to join the WTO, and no commitment by nuclear-weapons countries to work towards nuclear disarmament. There should be no reference to the International Criminal Court and no reference either to the UN Millennium Development Goals on poverty, education, disease, trade and aid.

 Passages promising a larger role for the general assembly were to be struck out, as was the promise to create a standing military capacity for UN peacekeeping. Gone was the reaffirmation that ?the use of force should be considered as an instrument of last resort,? the promise to ?encourage pharmaceutical companies to make anti-retroviral drugs affordable and accessible in Africa,? and any legal responsibility for the security council to authorize intervention to stop genocides and ethnic cleansing. 

 Try again

 Since the core project of expanding the security council has been postponed for several months in the face of irreconcilable ideas about how to do it, Bolton?s demands pulled the rug out from under the UN reform project. So the choice effectively becomes to let the Bush administration gut the reform process ? or to let it fail for now.

 The option of pressing ahead without American participation, as was done with the Kyoto accord, the ICC and a number of other recent international initiatives, does not exist in this case, for the US is a veto-wielding permanent member of the security council and also contributes a quarter of the UN?s budget. But the current US administration and its extreme world-view do not represent the views of all Americans and President Bush will not be in power forever.

 ?There is only the international community, which can only be led by the only remaining superpower, which is the United States.? That sums up the neo-conservatives? view of the world, but their political power is waning as their Iraq adventure collapses and their inability to cope even with domestic disasters becomes plain. Rather than agree to an inadequate document now and foreclose the possibility of further reform for many years, it would be better to let the current attempt fail and try again in three years? time.

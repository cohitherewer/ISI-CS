 GIRL UNINTERRUPTED

 Wonder years

 Strangeland By Tracey Emin, 

 Sceptre, ? 14.99

 Strangeland is indeed a weird and wonderful book ? part-autobiography and part-fantasy. Tracey Emin, the author, is the quintessential ?wild child?. A visual artist by profession, she wields her pen like a paint-brush ? creating disturbing yet wondrous vignettes of her childhood and adolescence in the small English town of Margate, the Turkey of her ancestors and her life in present-day London.

 Strangeland is divided into three sections ? ?Motherland?, ?Fatherland? and ?Traceyland?. In each section, Emin traces different aspects of her growing-up years. She believes her birth was an accident ? she was not supposed to be born ? somehow the birth of her twin, Paul, pulled her into this world?s Karmic cycle like ?a hook in the sky?. Emin shared a special bond with her brother, Paul, from the very moment of their conception, through the turbulence of adolescence, right up to the time he was imprisoned.

 Emin?s father was a wild, young Turk, who was into all kinds of mischief ? profiteering, gambling and innumerable illicit liaisons. He did not marry her mother but remained locked in a loveless but dutiful marriage to another woman. Tracey and Paul stayed with their mother in a cottage on the premises of a rundown hotel. As a child, she was mostly left to her own devices; as a result, she became fiercely independent from an early age. She spent her time gallivanting around town, befriending vagabonds and beach-bums and wallowing in Margate?s brilliant sunsets. Her childhood was cruelly cut short, when she was raped by her mother?s lover, and reality confronted her in all its sullied rawness.

 Emin was very close to both her parents ? in spirit, if not in person. She realized that her mother had worked very hard and suffered great hardships to look after her family in the early years. Thus began a life-long bond of unconditional love and ardent respect between mother and daughter.

 Emin also admired her father like a child admires Robin Hood or King Arthur. To her, the wild Turk was a mythical hero, a larger-than-life figure, romantically doomed yet heroic. She was more than indulgent to his wild and profligate ways. Though her father was mostly absent during her childhood, Emin came to know him quite will in the later years. She even accompanied him to Cyprus, the place of her birth, and that?s when she realized how much she loved this rakish outlaw who was her father.

 The author grew up in Margate, England, in the swinging seventies. Rock and roll was the rage ? Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly, the great Chuck Berry ? were still rocking round the clock. Discos were chock-a-block with gyrating teenagers and Tracey Emin was a wanton, precocious adolescent, hungry for life. Dancing at all-night discos, hanging out at the beach and having wild, unprotected sex ? she rode the proverbial tiger and cocked a snook at the price-tag.

 Strangeland is written in the manner of a long, continuous poem ? abstract and fanciful. Her brush-strokes are surreal and impressionistic. What emerges is a soulful, poignant depiction of a life lived on the razor?s edge. Tracey Emin seamlessly blends together imagination and reality to create a canvas of unmitigated brilliance. Her memoirs linger in your mind long after you have turned the final page.

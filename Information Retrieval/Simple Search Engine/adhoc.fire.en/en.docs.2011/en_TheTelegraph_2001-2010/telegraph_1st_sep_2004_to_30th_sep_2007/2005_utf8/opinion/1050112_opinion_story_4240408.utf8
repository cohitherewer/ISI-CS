 GET READY FOR A REPEAT PERFORMANCE 

 Laloo Yadav?s victory will not only 

 reinforce his distinctive politics, but also that which is 

 old and needs to be replaced, writes Mahesh Rangarajan

 Crowning glory 

 ?Bihar shows the way? has long 

 been a dictum in Indian politics. It certainly set the stage 

 for the movements that eventually led to the defeat of Indira 

 Gandhi. Paradoxically, it were the social realignments in 

 the same state that paved the way for Sonia Gandhi?s charge 

 to power earlier this year. It is clear that the coming 

 elections will see the ruling alliances both at the Centre 

 and in the state in a more confident mood than the opposition.

 As the state approaches the first 

 assembly elections after the birth of Jharkhand, it is clear 

 that Laloo Prasad Yadav will be the central player. The 

 Congress has been unable to outplay his card in the struggle 

 for dominance within the alliance, while Ram Vilas Paswan, 

 his senior in socialist politics, looks set to plough a 

 lonely furrow. On the other side, Nitish Kumar, his former 

 ally and now his b?te noire, has sided with the Bharatiya 

 Janata Party, which is intent on reviving Hindutva even 

 as he courts the vital minority voter.

 It is in fact quite remarkable 

 how long Laloo Yadav has survived in power. When he became 

 chief minister in March 1990, V.P. Singh was prime minister, 

 and Rajiv Gandhi still led the Congress. No other north 

 Indian state has seen a ruling party win two successive 

 elections while in office. Even in 2000, when most of his 

 formidable rivals got together to poll their votes, Laloo 

 Yadav?s party emerged as the single largest force. The division 

 of the state actually strengthened his hands as the BJP 

 lost some its key support bases, and the clout of lower 

 caste voters in the state only increased. For his rivals 

 as much as for his supporters, Laloo Yadav is, and will 

 remain, the ultimate symbol of the changes that have been 

 unleashed in the polity of the second-most populous state 

 in north India.

 It is ironical that over three 

 decades ago, and on the eve of the most far-reaching changes 

 in the state?s cultural and political landscape, a seasoned 

 and highly experienced scholar like Ramashray Roy could 

 rate the chances of change as low. In 1970, Roy wrote, ?The 

 time is still far away when the numerically stronger underprivileged 

 caste groups will come to dominate the political scene in 

 Bihar.?

 Politics was far from devoid caste-based 

 loyalties at the time. Roy would describe the ?dislodgement 

 from power? of the Kayastha by the Bhumihars and Rajputs 

 ? both latecomers to Western learning and education ? and 

 mobilization as a caste for political purposes. There were 

 already winds of change evident in the colleges and legislatures. 

 The former saw a slow but steady rise, often via 

 scholarships, of members of the cultivating and formerly 

 untouchable castes and communities. In the sphere of politics, 

 the emerging socialist movements included student leaders 

 from Yadav, Kurmi and Dalit backgrounds, men who a generation 

 later would straddle the political stage of the state.

 In Bihar, to a far greater extent 

 than Uttar Pradesh, the grammar of a cultural revolt rather 

 than the minutiae of an economic programme would hold sway. 

 This was common to the political style of Laloo Yadav?s 

 real predecessor, Karpoori Thakur, who became chief minister 

 in 1977. The Congress never quite recovered from the onslaught 

 and fell back on a succession of Bhumihar and Rajput chief 

 ministers, none of whom was able to stem the formation of 

 new grassroots-level alliances. These came to fruition in 

 the first Laloo Yadav ministry, when he arrested L.K. Advani, 

 expanded the scope of reservations and created a unified 

 bloc of Yadav, Muslim and Dalit voters that has stood by 

 him through thick and thin.

 There is no doubt that the cultural 

 matrix of the state and its social character have changed 

 in irreversible ways. Bihar was where the alternative axis 

 of caste-based mobilization stemmed the growth of Hindutva, 

 and eventually, it was the only large Hindi-belt state to 

 line up behind the United Progressive Alliance last summer. 

 Yet there is no corresponding halt to the slide of the state 

 in simple economic terms.

 What is still significant is the 

 extent to which Bihar lags behind, not only with respect 

 to the more prosperous states in western and southern India, 

 but also behind its neighbours. UP has a per capita state 

 domestic product of $202, and West Bengal is pegged at $373. 

 Even Jharkhand is ahead with $197. For Bihar, it is a lowly 

 $115. It has slid further down in most other critical indices.

 Interestingly, none of the opponents 

 of the ruling RJD is in much of a position to garner support 

 on the issue of the slow pace of development or the uneven 

 distribution of the gains. Nitish Kumar was a Union minister 

 at the time of the carve-up of the state, and it briefly 

 looked like he and the former chief minister would sink 

 differences and bat for Bihar.

 The promised aid package of Rs 

 4 billion never quite materialized. Unlike in neighbouring 

 West Bengal, where the ruling party played on the theme 

 of discrimination by the Centre, no one from Bihar played 

 a regional card. This was clear under the United Front and 

 again in the six-year-long Vajpayee period. The rhetoric 

 of the new UPA bodes well for Bihar, which has 26 of the 

 country?s most depressed 60 districts. The focus on rural 

 employment, protection from floods and revival of water 

 bodies, with the fillip to agriculture, could actually benefit 

 the state in a direct manner. There have also been initiatives 

 for fresh investment from the railways, which is controlled 

 by none other than Laloo Yadav himself.

 Bihar has been a critical plank 

 of support for successive governments in New Delhi but has 

 failed to capitalize on this in any constructive manner. 

 Perhaps the fragmentation of the polity on caste-based lines 

 precludes any coherent regional personality from emerging. 

 In contrast to southern India, where lower caste rebellion 

 led eventually not only to the emergence of a new bloc of 

 ruling forces but a new economic model, this has not been 

 the case in much of north India.

 The former managers of cultivation 

 and tenant farmers, who are grouped under the caste categories 

 of Yadavs or Kurmis, lead the two major alliances. One has 

 forged close ties with Muslims and with the Dalits; the 

 other has aligned close to the upper castes. But none has 

 evolved an alternative economic model. The roots of the 

 malaise go back a long way. Bihar did not have a proponent 

 of agricultural interests like Charan Singh in UP. Nor did 

 it have a class-based model of mobilization with a modernist 

 message, as in Bengal. Trader communities never became allies 

 of the non-Brahmin movement, as they did in the peninsular 

 regions where Tamil, Telugu or Kannad are the lingua 

 franca.

 In its place, all the three sections 

 of the forward classes, the other backward classes and the 

 Dalits coveted and continue to covet government jobs at 

 a time when these are set to decline. The neglect of the 

 region by the rest of the country has not helped. In fact, 

 compared to the Indus basin regions of Punjab and Haryana, 

 the lower Ganga basin has hardly received much by way of 

 ?hard? investment. The various missions of the Union government 

 in schooling or health have scarcely made a dent. Laloo 

 Yadav still has the option of drawing on Central aid and 

 give the state the new deal it has long been waiting for.

 Bihar shows the way to a specific 

 kind of politics where cultural assertion is the norm. It 

 has not shown a way beyond the replacement of a former landed 

 elite and service gentry by a more broad-based ruling elite, 

 but one which has no real vision of how to increase the 

 size of the cake or redistribute it in new ways. No over-arching 

 regional identity can be a binding force as in the west 

 and south. Even in comparison to other parts in the North, 

 OBC as well as Dalit politics have not forged a link with 

 emerging forms of economic organization. Another victory 

 for Laloo Yadav will reinforce what is new and distinctive 

 about him. But it will also mean ringing in the old once 

 again.

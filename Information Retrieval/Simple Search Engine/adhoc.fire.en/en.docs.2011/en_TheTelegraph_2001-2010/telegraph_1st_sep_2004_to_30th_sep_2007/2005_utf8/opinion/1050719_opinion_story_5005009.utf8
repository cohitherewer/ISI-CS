 SING THE TUNE

 Too much goodness in politics often translates into timidity in action. This is what has happened to Mr Manmohan Singh. Nobody doubts Mr Singh?s integrity and the fact that he is a thorough gentleman. But these virtues and qualities are not standing him in good stead in his present job. Even Mr Singh?s admirers and well-wishers are beginning to have doubts about his abilities to hold the top job in India. Being prime minister of India is emphatically not about being nice and learned. On the contrary, it is about providing leadership in the face of adversity. Admittedly, the adversity that Mr Singh faces is not of his own making. Rather they are embedded in the circumstances that created the coalition called the United Progressive Alliance. The threat to Mr Singh?s leadership abilities comes from those who see themselves as the champions of the word ?progressive? within the UPA. The left has thwarted every attempt made by the prime minister to push through economic reforms. It has stopped disinvestment; it has prevented the entry of foreign investment in certain sectors; it has raised a hue and cry every time there has been a hike in the price of oil; it has opposed pension reforms and reforms of the labour market. Mr Singh has caved in every time the left has shrieked. Moreover, the left has tried to tell the prime minister about how he should conduct himself during his negotiations with the president of the United States of America.

 Mr Singh, not to put too fine a point on it, has failed to tell the left who is running the government. This failure has raised the suspicion that maybe he is not running the government. A man of Mr Singh?s stature cannot allow himself to be reduced to a puppet of the left or of any other person or pressure group. It is better to admit failure as a leader than to be a leader who is not the master of his own mind. The left has about 60 members in the Lok Sabha, and on the basis of this it is trying to hold Mr Singh?s government at ransom. It is time Mr Singh called its bluff. The left has as much to lose as the Congress if the UPA government falls because of the left withdrawing its support. By betraying the UPA, the left will only further marginalize itself. If Mr Singh wants to be remembered as a prime minister, he should behave like one by refusing to succumb to pressure. Otherwise, he will be remembered as the finance minister who started economic reforms and then forgot his own agenda.

 WITHOUT DOING FULL JUSTICE 

The recent amendment to the Criminal Procedure Code 

can neither enforce the rule of law nor reform the criminal justice system, says 

Tarunabh Khaitan

 Misrule of law 

Very recently, in Oxford, the prime minister extolled the benign consequences of the British rule over India mdash; one of them being the ldquo;rule of law rdquo;. Like most political 

 slogans, the content of the rule of law is rarely understood and frequently 

 ignored. The Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act, 2005, analysed on the basis of the rule of law, embodies a missed opportunity and a lack of vision.

In legal and political theory, the rule of law is 

 a political ideal that demands that the government and its officials shall be 

 ruled by law and be subject to it. The ideal is often expressed in the phrase, ?government by law and not by men?, and has its roots in England?s transition 

 from absolute monarchy to parliamentary governance. The actions of government 

 officials, ministers, judges, bureaucrats and police officers must be governed 

 by a duly enacted general law, and should not be guided by personal whims and 

 fancies. The rule of law protects the citizen from arbitrary government.

The criminal justice system, comprising, chiefly, 

the police, the prosecution and the judiciary, is the arm of the state closest 

to the citizen. This proximity empowers it to violate the rule of law, frequently 

and brutally. Every time a police officer wrongly arrests or tortures a citizen 

with impunity, every time a rich or powerful person escapes punishment for a crime 

by bribing the prosecution, and every time a minister interferes in the criminal 

justice machinery to secure partisan goals, the ideal is compromised.

An independent and easily accessible judiciary which 

fearlessly tries people, irrespective of power, wealth, status or political affiliation 

is a sine qua non for the rule of law. The rule of law also demands an 

independent police organization and an independent prosecution service, which 

are free from political interference in their day-to-day functioning while being 

accountable for their actions. In this respect, the design of public institutions 

should be informed by the rule of law.

The current amendment draws partly on the report, 

especially those provisions that deal with the prosecution and police powers. 

One of the most significant reforms in this regard is the provision for a ?directorate 

of prosecution? to oversee the prosecution services in a state. As an attempt 

to organize the prosecutorial service more efficiently, this is a welcome step. 

However, the amendment fails to grant effective autonomy and functional independence 

to the directorate, keeping it vulnerable to political interference.

In requiring the concurrence of the chief justice 

of the high court in the appointment of the director of prosecution and the deputies, 

the amendment provides an important but inadequate check against partisan appointments. 

There is no security of tenure for the directors either.

The amendment further provides that the directorate 

shall function under the administrative control of the home department of the 

state. It is significant to note that the Malimath committee recommended that 

the directorate should function under the guidance of the advocate-general, an 

independent constitutional authority, rather than the home department. It is another 

matter that the constitutional offices of the advocate-general and the attorney-general 

have also allowed political dictation in practice. Surely, a democratically-elected 

government should have the power to set broad policy objectives for the prosecution 

machinery. But in the current system, which provides no functional and organizational 

independence to the prosecution, the government directly interferes in decisions 

regarding individual prosecutions as well. The decision not to prosecute an individual 

should be a technical judgment arrived at by considering the gravity of the offence, 

the availability of resources, prosecutorial goals and the soundness of evidence. 

With governments making such decisions, the criteria invariably becomes the political 

weight of the accused or the political cost of a trial.

The amendment leaves untouched the notorious Section 

197 of the CrPC, which requires prior sanction of the government for the prosecution 

of public servants. This provision makes a mockery of the ideal of the rule of 

law. It should not surprise us that it takes forever to even file charges in cases 

involving anyone politically important.

The manner in which the powers of the police have 

been dealt with is even worse. Despite the crying need to reform the police machinery 

and ensure that it adheres to the rule of law ? underscored by the role of the 

police in the Gujarat violence in 2002 ? the amendment only tinkers with certain 

powers of the police. When a structural overhaul is needed, it has made half-hearted 

attempts at functional transparency.

The amendment proposes to impose a duty on the police 

to inform the arrestee of his right to nominate a relative or friend who shall 

be informed about the arrest. It also provides for mandatory judicial inquiry 

into custodial death and rape. The arrestee now has a right to receive a copy 

of the medical report regarding allegations of torture. Most of these changes 

are presentational. Unless structural reforms happen, the police will continue 

to brutalize, rape and kill. The Indian Police Act, which continues to govern 

the police organization, was enacted by a colonial regime in 1861 to maintain 

the repressive foreign authority. It is time the police-citizen relationship is 

redefined.

The primary need is to ensure organizational insulation 

of the police force from the political machinery. Again, the democratic government 

must control the broad policing policy, but should not meddle with the daily functioning 

of the police force. Successive governments have regularly used their power to 

transfer or deny promotion to police officers as a means of making the police 

serve partisan objective. The prime minister?s recent suggestion of a secure tenure 

for senior police officers is therefore welcome.

Organizational independence must be coupled with stringent 

accountability measures. The main problem is that the police station is the most 

invisible of places, making it difficult to control behaviour. The English Police 

and Criminal Evidence Act, 1984 instituted the office of the custody officer within 

the police station, whose main function is to oversee police behaviour. The involvement 

of NGOs and the civil society through measures like visitation rights and access 

to detainees should be institutionalized. An independent police commission with 

administrative control over policing and doubling up as a complaint authority 

may be a step towards a solution. 

The amendment does have some positive provisions, 

including special features for women arrestees and rape victims. However, it lacks 

a coherent organizational principle to reform two crucial criminal justice institutions. 

A vision to subject the police and the prosecution to the law of the land and 

not to arbitrary dictates of ministers is necessary.

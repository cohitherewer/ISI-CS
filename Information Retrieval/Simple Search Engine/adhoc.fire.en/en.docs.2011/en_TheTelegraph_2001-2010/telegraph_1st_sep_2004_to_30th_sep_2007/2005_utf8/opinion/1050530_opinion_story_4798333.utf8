 AS GOOD AS IT GETS

 GWYNNE DYER

 ?If we could get out of this conference without a major blow-up, we would be doing well,? said Matt Martin, deputy director of the British American Security Information Council, when the review conference on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty opened in May. There was not even a final document when it closed on Friday, May 27, but nobody actually stormed out vowing never to return, so maybe we are doing well. Not nearly well enough, however.

 These conferences have been held every 5 years since the NPT came into effect in 1970. The last one, in 2000, seemed to be making real progress: it agreed on ?Thirteen Steps? to prevent the further spread of nuclear weapons and to hold the existing nuclear powers to their commitment to eliminate their nuclear arsenals in the long run. But that was then, and this is a very different time.

 North Korea, panicked by its inclusion in president Bush?s ?axis of evil? by loose talk in Washington about ?regime change,? pulled out of the NPT and began claiming that it had or would soon have nuclear weapons. Whether that is true remains open to question, but the US invasion of Iraq confirmed Kim Jong-Il?s belief that only nuclear weapons could deter a US attack.

 Holy mess

 North Korea stated that it had nuclear weapons and refused to return to the six-power talks that were intended to persuade it to drop its nuclear plans. Mohamed El Baradei, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, called Pyongyang?s actions ?a cry for help?. They are hopelessly inept at diplomacy, in other words, but basically they want a deal.

 It?s probably true, but nobody in Washington believes it. Nor do they believe Iran?s assurances that its uranium enrichment programme is purely to fuel peaceful nuclear power reactors. After all, the Iranians have lived under the threat of Israeli nuclear strikes for around 40 years, and latterly their inclusion in Bush?s ?axis of evil? has led them to fear a direct American attack as well.

 Meanwhile the Bush administration continues to pursue its goal of a new generation of mini-nukes under cover of the so-called Reliable Replacement Warhead programme. Britain plans to replace its existing Trident missiles and probably its nuclear warheads as well. And neither country will allow Israel?s unacknowledged nuclear weapons to be discussed in non-proliferation talks. It?s a mess, and it meant that the 2005 NPT review conference was bound to fail.

 Silver lining

 The non-nuclear countries insisted that the priority was for the existing nuclear powers to start living up to their promises to eliminate nuclear weapons. The Western nuclear powers swept that aside, saying that the priority was to prevent further proliferation of nuclear weapons. They were both right, but they were unable even to agree on an agenda until the third week of the conference, and it closes with absolutely nothing accomplished. 

 Although America and Russia continue to possess over 90 per cent of the world?s nuclear weapons between them, the actual number of warheads in their arsenals has fallen by more than half in the past 15 years, and is scheduled to shrink by many thousands more in coming years. 

 Even if Iran and/or North Korea should acquire a token number of nuclear weapons for deterrent purposes, neither regime has shown the urge for self-immolation that would be needed for it to launch those weapons, in the certain knowledge that instant annihilation would follow in the form of an overwhelming nuclear counter-strike. And even if they did get nuclear weapons, it is not clear why other countries in their region would feel compelled to follow their example. The situation is not good, but it is probably less bad than it seems.

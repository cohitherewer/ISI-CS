 BETWEEN FRIENDSHIPS

 The IAEA vote on Iran was a signal that India was ready to shrug off Cold War loyalties in favour of self-interest, writes Jyoti Malhotra

 Walking tall

 The Ronen Sen school pulled off stage two of the dulcet duet, currently playing between India and the United States of America, in faraway Vienna late last month, sweetening the hostility of their Cold War years with promises to keep wannabe states like Iran out and beyond the pale of the nuclear ?lakshman rekha?. As the equal music at the International Atomic Energy Agency meet in Austria?s imperial capital rose to an unprecedented crescendo, New Delhi came out of the closet to vote in favour of a US-backed European Union resolution, censuring Tehran?s secret desire to build a nuclear weapons programme. Clearly, George Walker Bush Jr seemed to have absorbed at least one small lesson from the smash-and-grab invasion of Iraq of the last two years, Abu Ghraib and all ? which is, the postponement of gratification has its uses. The IAEA agreed last weekend that Iran would be given until November to comply with whatever ?fatwa? it had in mind.

 But it is the dramatic background of India?s decision to play in the fast lane of international realpolitik that constitutes the real story behind this article ? how Ronen Sen, India?s first ambassador to the new Russia in the early Nineties, thought little of going behind the back of the then Russian president, Boris Yeltsin, and successfully sabotaging a US-Russia move to stop the sale and technology transfer of cryogenic engines from the Russian space establishment to the Indian Space Research Organization. And how, in 2005, Sen, now ambassador to the US, persuaded a largely ossified Congress party back home that it was in India?s interest to side with the US and against Iran at the IAEA. 

 Actually, it didn?t really matter who was at the receiving end, the point being the importance of being seen to be rooting for the man ? Bush ? who stood up against large chunks of his own establishment in July to accord international legitimacy to India?s nuclear power status.

 As the sound and fury over Iran?s alleged threat to break off the $22 billion LNG deal with India ? in the wake of New Delhi?s vote against a fellow non-aligned nation ? died down as quickly as it rose, you can safely bet that when Ernst amp; Young gives in its financial feasibility report on the Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline in December, New Delhi will, most likely, vote in favour.

 With one caveat. Pakistan?s Pervez Musharraf, who reportedly sought to persuade Bush at the United Nations general assembly in New York in mid-September, that he would be willing to abandon the pipeline project in exchange for four civilian nuclear reactors (Bush said no), doesn?t find another excuse to turn his back on the pipeline. 

 Truth is, India?s hardly selling bits and pieces of its five thousand-year-old civilization to the Americans, just as it didn?t to the Soviets during all those decades of the Cold war. (The Mitrokhin archives are at best a bit of tawdry glitter, not even remotely reminiscent of John le Carr?.)

 This, then, is the essential underpinning of the Ronen Sen school: India has no permanent interests at all. It can hang out with the Russians one day, with the Americans the next day and with the Iranians the third. There?s absolutely no problem with voting against Iran?s nuclear programme and at the same time paying Iran for large quantities of oil and gas to galvanize India?s economic growth.

 It?s an idea the Congress seems to be slowly coming to terms with, now that it has gone about dealing with the real world in its one year in power. After all, it is the now legendary rapport of the external affairs minister, K. Natwar Singh, with the US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, that helped pull off the nuclear deal in July. Indeed, it was Singh who told the chief of the Atomic Energy Commission, Anil Kakodkar, that it wasn?t fair to constantly shift goalposts with the Americans, even as the two sides negotiated the crucial nuclear deal. And that he must, once and for all, lay down the bottomline on behalf of the Indian scientific establishment. Once Kakodkar had done so, Singh conveyed the terms and conditions to the Americans.

 This idea of calling a spade a spade ? in the service of self-interest ? has strangely been in disuse in the Indian intelligentsia when it came to foreign affairs. Which Indian, for example, would refuse to send his children to an American university? So while the intellectual classes agonized and agitated at home, the middle classes voted with their feet for the ?open skies? policy with the US, brokered between the Congress and the Bush administration a few months ago.

 Similarly, Natwar Singh?s visit to Iran ? which so upset the Americans ? was predicated on the belief that as old friends, it was India?s responsibility to try and persuade Tehran to abide by the IAEA norms, even as it put together a programme for the peaceful use of nuclear energy. To be sure, Singh couldn?t have told the Iranians that India was going to vote against Tehran at the IAEA ? assuming the decision had been taken at the time. The visit was clearly a delicate balancing act, however unintended. Unfortunately, it upset too many people.

 Clearly, India is still getting used to its self-determined shrugging off of the old world order. So is the rest of the world. Within hours of India voting with the US in Vienna, Canada was promising Singh a revival of dual-use technology, including those for civilian nuclear use that it had denied India since Indira Gandhi went nuclear in 1974. For Singh, who still remembers those days, Toronto must have constituted events coming a full circle. Just as Vienna promises the opening up of a whole new world.

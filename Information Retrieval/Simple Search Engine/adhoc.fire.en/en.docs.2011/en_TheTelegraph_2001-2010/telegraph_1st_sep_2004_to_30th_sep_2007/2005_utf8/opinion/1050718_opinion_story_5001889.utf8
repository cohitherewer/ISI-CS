 TIME FOR STRESS

 To whom, and for what, are stressed out students in West Bengal appealing to? The prevalence of an extreme form of psychological breakdown, often leading to suicide, is reported every year, particularly after the board examinations and after the engineering and medical entrance examinations. The reactions may seem disproportionate to the adult world. But the unhealthy burden of an overpopulated higher education system, run more or less on the ?excel or perish? principle, is a grim reality for young people in India who have had the privilege of a ?proper? education. In the light of this reality, the Central Board of Secondary Education?s decision to provide examinees with extra time for reading the question paper is sensible, like the one allowing calculators. But the West Bengal board and council that run the secondary and higher secondary examinations respectively have been rather mean-minded about such relief. The education minister has firmly refused to fall in with the other boards, and the pettiness of his ?stand? is what students will inevitably have to put up with when politicians, and not educationists, make decisions regarding the education of the young. But the question remains as to whether such trivial ?reforms? as extra time for reading the question paper are really going to make any substantial difference to students? stress. Surely, the problem is far more fundamental, concerning numbers and attitudes, and larger issues of infrastructure and opportunities, together with the quality of teaching and the nature of evaluation.

 In this regard, it is significant that Calcutta University has been rethinking its examinations structure. Instead of having to sit two examinations at the end of the second and third years, undergraduates of the university will, from the next academic year, sit for an examination at the end of each of the three years of their course. Notionally, such a break-up should make the burden of each set of examinations more bearable, although other universities ? like Burdwan, Kalyani, Vidyasagar and North Bengal ? claim that this change does not really make that much of a difference. In fact, the second-year examinations then become unduly heavy. And there might be some truth in that. More systematic efforts are necessary to tackle the very real problem of student stress, and uniformity is essential for the system to be just.

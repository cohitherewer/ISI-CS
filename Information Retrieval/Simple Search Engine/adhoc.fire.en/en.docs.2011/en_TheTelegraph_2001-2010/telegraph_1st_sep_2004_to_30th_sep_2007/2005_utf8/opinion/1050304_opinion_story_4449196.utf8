 Letters to Editor

 More sinned against

 Sir ? It is quite heartening to find that Vinod Pande?s film, Sins, has been cleared for release by the high court. This is in the highest tradition of promoting the right to freedom of speech and expression. The Christian community, being extremely civilized and disciplined, has protested in the most non-violent manner. One wonders whether things would have been the same if the film-maker had made a film on any subject concerning Hindus or Muslims. In the former case, goons from the Shiv Sena,Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the Bajrang Dal would have vandalized theatres where the film was being screened and forced Pande to run for his life. In case of the other minority community, a nationwide communal riot would have been on the cards. I would still welcome Pande to consider such subjects. By the way, I am a Hindu, although I am no longer proud of my religious identity after Gujarat.

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

 Falling in line

 Sir ? As expected, Laloo Prasad Yadav?s railway budget for 2005-0006 was unapologetically populist. Economics was shoved to the backseat, as evident from the way fares and freight rates have been manipulated. Now, the prices of articles of common consumption are bound to go up, without the government having to do anything. The budget, moreover, lacks direction. The most important issues that plague Indian Railways ? namely the safety and security of bonafide passengers, modernization, replacement of old tracks and bridges, gauge conversion, the 20,000 unarmed crossings and so on ? have been left untouched. Suggestions to end cross-subsidies or implement the Fare and Freight Committee Report were ignored. It was the absence of Laloo Yadav from the capital during the finalization of the budget that ensured that some concrete changes could be included. Hence the privatization of container services, simplification of the cumbersome freight classification and revamp of the railways accounting system. But LPG, petrol or diesel will not be cheaper as a result of the reduced freights. The benefits will not pass on to the consumer as these are already highly subsidized items. The sops to students and examinees aren?t novel either. We have seen other railway ministers try it.

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Das Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? What does Laloo Yadav, who invariably travels in special trains when he has to, know about the railways? It is not unexpected that there was no mention of more trains in the heavy traffic routes, more manned level-crossings or security for travellers. Laloo Yadav also does not deserve to be congratulated for non-revision of fares. When air fares are going down, rail fares cannot go up. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shiv Shanker Almal, Calcutta

 Sir ? The Union rail budget for 2005-2006 is another exercise in political gimmickry. Only 20 of the 32 new trains announced last year were actually introduced. Even this year, it will not be feasible to run the 46 new trains announced, as broad-gauge conversions are yet to be completed. This year?s budget also goes against basic economic principles. Half the new trains cover less than 200 kilometres. Remember, the Indian Railways had to extend the Taj Express to Gwalior, instead of limiting it to Agra, for maximum utilization of rake.

 Covering up losses from low passenger-fares through rise in freight tariffs results is a wasteful habit. The reformist prime minister, Manmohan Singh, should ensure that passenger and freight tariffs are not decided without consultation with the proposed rail tariff advisory board. 

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir ? The rail budget is without vision. There are no mega projects planned for the metropolitan cities despite the fact that EMU services are not being able to handle the pressure. Calcutta, for example, could have done with one new railway terminal to deal with the ever-increasing number of daily passengers. The people of this state thought that 41 members of parliament in the United Progressive Alliance would have given them some new projects or rail bridges. Why didn?t our MPs have the guts to demand funds for new projects or even for the necessary repairs?

 Yours faithfully,

Jayanta Datta, Chinsurah 

 Parting shot

 Sir ? A vehicle bearing registration number WB 02N 6590 was parked in front of the City Centre at Salt Lake at 4 pm on February 26, 2005. Nothing extraordinary one may say, only that it was a no-parking area and the vehicle was placed just next to the ?No Parking? board. A closer scrutiny of the olive green vehicle revealed that it belonged to the commandant of the 115th Battalion. It is extremely disappointing that senior officers of the armed forces, who are trained to be disciplined, show scant regard for the law.

 Yours faithfully,

Saibal Bagchi, Calcutta

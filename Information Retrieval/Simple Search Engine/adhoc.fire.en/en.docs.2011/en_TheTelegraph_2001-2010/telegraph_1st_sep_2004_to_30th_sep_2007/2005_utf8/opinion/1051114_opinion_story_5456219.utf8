 NONE TO FIGHT WITH

 Gwynne Dyer

 You can see why North Korea might feel safer with nuclear weapons: Russia to the north, China to the west and the US Seventh Fleet to the east and south all bristle with nukes. You can see why Iran might want nuclea weapons, too: Russia to the north, US bases and ships to the south, and Israel to the west all have nuclear missiles, and they probably all have the coordinates of Iranian targets in their guidance systems. It?s obvious why India and Pakistan developed nuclear weapons. But Britain? Who on earth is Britain trying to deter?

 When Tony Blair announced that a decision will be taken to replace Britain?s existing nuclear deterrent (four submarines carrying Trident missiles) within the life of the present parliament, an MP from his own party, Paul Flynn, pointed out the yawning gap in the prime minister?s logic: ?To have a nuclear deterrent now ? where these Trident submarines wander the oceans with missiles aimed at nothing ? is a meaningless proposition.? And they really are aimed at nothing.

 They certainly aren?t aimed at Russia any more, and none of the other nuclear weapons powers has a quarrel with Britain either. The British government has abandoned its old ?no-first-use? rule and now apes the US policy of leaving all the options open, but in practice, you cannot think of a possible target for British nuclear weapons even under the new rules.

 Dependent power

 Even defence secretary, John Reid, does not try to justify Britain?s ?independent nuclear deterrent? in terms of current threats, instead evoking an uncertain future. ?It is impossible in most cases to predict where your enemy will come from... nobody foresaw the invasion of the Falklands or that Saddam would invade Kuwait...so to say whether we might have a nuclear enemy in 15 years? time is a difficult question to answer...?

 Nobody ever advocated using nuclear weapons on Buenos Aires or Baghdad, and Britain?s own history suggests that ?nuclear enemies? eventually cease to be enemies, so it?s hard to treat this as a serious argument. 

 Since even the British government admits that it would take only 14 years to build a replacement for its existing nuclear deterrent, no decision on the next generation of British nuclear weapons, if any, should be needed for another five years. What really drives the timetable is the fact that the US will soon take decisions on replacing its own Tridents, and Britain must move at the same time if it wants to hitch a ride on the next generation of American technology.

 Let them go

 Britain is not a truly independent nuclear power like the US, Russia, France, China, Israel, India and Pakistan. It manufactures its own nuclear war

 -heads, but ever since the Nassau agreement of 1962, it has depended on the US for its missiles ? and those missiles come with strings attached. The Tridents that Britain operates would be unusable in 18 months without American technical support, and it is unimaginable that Britain would ever fire them without American consent.

 So the ?prestige? of being a nuclear weapons power only impresses the British public, not the foreign experts, and Britain?s weapons have no credible targets, and it will cost an estimated $45 billion to replace them. Maybe it?s time to let them go.

 More nations have turned their backs on nuclear weapons in the past generation than have developed new ones but no traditional great power has ever walked away from nuclear weapons before. Tony Blair will do nothing that would embarrass his soul-brother George Bush, but in a year or two he will probably be gone. His successor will have a great opportunity.

 ON LAND, AND OVER THE WATER

 Dipankar Bose

 With each hike in the prices of petrol and diesel, Indians must regret that their administrators have not paid more attention to inland waterways. Not only would inland waterways be cheaper and more fuel efficient, but they would also help bring about a more balanced regional development. 

 Going back to the history of transportation in India, both land and river routes developed simultaneously, with roads linking the major inland towns to the coast or other important towns. But the coming of the railways disrupted the growth of river and road transport. Since the East India Company and the British regime had a stake in the financial viability of the railways, most of the funds available were also spent for the railways. Even after independence, while the railways and roadways were taken care of, the internal waterways were neglected, so much so that the rivers and the canals silted up. 

 The railways connected the ports to the hinterland, bypassing the older towns. It was done to facilitate external trade at the cost of internal trade. This led the railways to charge less for cargo moving to and from ports than for moving cargo inland. Over time, this led to the lopsided growth of the port cities at the cost of small towns and the traditional modes of transport. Now, the wheel seems to have turned full circle with the major cities bursting at the seams, the cost of constructing rail tracks and highways shooting up and petroleum prices soaring.

 For the long haul

 The present pattern of freight traffic has emerged as a result of the lopsided nature of the development within the economy. To bring about a more balanced growth, the resources available within a region must be utilized more widely. This can be done, at least partially, by developing alternatives to the present pattern of transportation, which involves hauling goods across the country by roadways and railways. Internal waterways can fit in very well into such a scheme.

 For instance, the Ganga-Hooghly river system connects the Calcutta and the Haldia ports to central West Bengal, northern Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh. With mechanized cargo-handling at the important stops and a perennially navigable channel, this waterway, along with the Calcutta-Haldia port complex, could have offered economic transportation to cargo from the hinterland. But the absence of night navigation facility doubles the transit time, and even the minimum draft along the channel is not assured in the dry season beyond Patna. Beyond Calcutta, modern cargo- handling facility is available only at Farakka and Patna. This being the state of the ?National Waterway No. 1?, one can easily imagine the state of the other waterways. 

 Feeder roads

 These facts assume great importance in view of the astronomical sums being spent on improving the national highways, especially the much-vaunted Golden Quadrilateral project for the last five-six years. What seems to have been forgotten is that roadways are uneconomical for long haul of goods vis-?-vis the railways and waterways. Roadways are really complementary to other modes of transport, being particularly suitable for short haul of goods or as a feeder service between the other two. So, state highways and district roads should get more attention than they have received till now. 

 This will also distribute the fruits of economic development more evenly in the countryside. In fact, the inordinate importance given to highways is aggravating the already lopsided growth patterns within the country. In a country of diverse topographies like India, there is no reason why travel over water should not be as popular as that over land.

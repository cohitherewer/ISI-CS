 Letters to Editor

 The VAT spat

 Sir ? The West Bengal finance minister, Asim Dasgupta, may well spearhead the speedy implementation of value-added tax, but his predecessor, Ashok Mitra, thinks the whole exercise is illegal and unconstitutional (?Opposition to VAT?, Jan 15). The ridiculousness of Mitra?s choice of terms aside, the VAT imbroglio in Bengal has come to embody the inherent inconsistencies in the collective thinking of the left. Mitra does not seem to have anything concrete to say against the new tax regime. How does the prevailing sales tax regime, with its numerous loopholes in implementation and opportunities for evasion, present a more favourable option than VAT, which would lead to an increase in revenues and simultaneously, avoid the generic cascading effect of higher taxation? Is the proposition of greater transparency and a revolutionary change in the attitude of tax-payers that VAT would bring about, unpalatable for a dyed-in-the-wool communist like Mitra? 

 Yours faithfully,

Prasenjit Das, Calcutta

 Money at hand

 Sir ? Ashok Mitra lets his imagination run away with itself when talking about the role of foreign exchange reserves in the Indian economy (?Money to burn?, Jan 21). Later in the article, he turns to the same old, and very general, arguments against ?foreign imperialism?.

 Mitra seems sceptical that the forex will be used to develop basic infrastructure. He insinuates that the deputy planning commissioner wants to deploy the reserves to build airports and roadways of international standard. A few things need to be remembered here. India has more airports compared to many countries, say China. But, India?s overall air traffic is very low and most of the airports are a drag on the finances of the Airports Authority of India. The government?s bid to prop up Air India and Indian Airlines has left Indian consumers without the choice of better and cheaper services for long. Thus, contrary to what Mitra believes, ?qualitative? and ?quantitative? upgradation of infrastructure would not not just attract foreigners, it would benefit Indians as well.

 Two, the author is factually wrong when he claims that M.S. Ahluwalia has suggested that we spend all our forex, barring a $50 billion reserve stock, on infrastructure. Such an inflationary move would be insane, and the Planning Commission would never recommend it. Countries like China have long used their forex reserves to boost infrastructure, and India?s physical infrastructure is very poor in comparison. Three, the author makes the sweeping remark that the bulk of our reserves do not belong to us. He forgets that India?s exports have grown in rupee terms between April-July 2005 compared to the same period last year. This is not a one-off improvement ? ever since liberalization, our exports have been growing significantly. The only reason for its somewhat slow pace compared to China are the enterprise-strangling policies we have had for half a century. 

 The foreign institutional investments pouring into the Sensex are not solely speculative in character, and arguing thus is an insult to India?s entrepreneurs who have built thriving, world-class companies. Mitra must be day-dreaming when he recommends more controls on foreign funds. State intervention in the economy is a thing of the past. India needs large doses of foreign investment to boost exports, employment and growth and whoever doesn?t realize this is out of touch with reality.

 Sir ? Ashok Mitra writes with conviction that international speculators contribute as much as 40 per cent of the transactions in the share market and also that once it is time for profit-gathering, they sell their shares and take their earnings abroad. Can he cite specific examples of such repatriation? Our capital markets ? a source of industrial finance ? has been abuzz with activity in recent times, especially after the abolition of the capital gains tax. And not all that activity is by FIIs.

 Yours faithfully, 

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? Ashok Mitra is convinced that were our forex reserves to be invested in infrastructure, it would be to build ?dazzling expressways? and ?dizzy skyscrapers?, among other things. Even if this does come about, why does he overlook the benefits, in terms of forward and backward linkages, that this would result in?

 Yours faithfully, 

A. Mandal, Calcutta

 Food for thought

 Sir ? The amount of Rs 5,000 crore that is being siphoned off from the public distribution system is certainly sensational (?Scam to beat fodder scam?, Jan 7). The story in Assam is similar, with the people entrusted with the job of feeding the poor consuming most of the foodstuffs themselves. Since the government spends so much on the PDS, it should also have an effective machinery to disclose important data like the amount of grains available for distribution, the amount of subsidies granted and the beneficiaries. The information can then be used to investigate into the corrupt practices that prevail and also to clean up the system. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Utpal Borpatragohain, Dibrugarh

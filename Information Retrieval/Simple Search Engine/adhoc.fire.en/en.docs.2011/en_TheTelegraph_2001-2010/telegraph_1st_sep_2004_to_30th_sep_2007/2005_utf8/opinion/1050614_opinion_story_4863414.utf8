 STANDING OUT

 Does merit always ensure opportunities in higher education for students in West Bengal? A number of cases recently reported in the media adds up to a rather bleak answer to this question. The higher secondary examinations seem to be a frustrating watershed for many students in the state who wish, and are qualified, to move beyond it. They come mostly from the districts; their parents roll bidis, or are agricultural labourers, retired group-D staff, tea-stall owners, tutors or tram conductors. They are not desperately poor, and have managed to give their children a certain level of education. This is a matter of concerted struggle, for both parents and children, and the struggle does bear fruit ? but often a bitter fruit. Many of these students do exceptionally well, qualifying to go to the top medical and engineering colleges. But this is also precisely when the doors begin to shut for them. They simply do not have the money to go on with the education that they have striven for and now richly deserve. It is also true that when their ?stories? are reported by the media, there is an overwhelmingly generous response from individuals, corporate houses and NGOS. Such private funds often end up meeting, amply but randomly, the needs of many of these students. Yet these are only the cases that get reported, and there has been no attempt yet to systematize this private largesse for a greater number of needy students.

 The plight of the meritorious underprivileged in the higher-education ?free market? ought to be looked in the face through these careers running up against pure misfortune. The state?s withdrawal from higher education is the basis on which a liberalized private education sector is premised. Yet this brutal delinking of merit and opportunity can only be fostered in a set-up where this withdrawal has taken place unthinkingly without any alternative vision for marshalling private resources for those whose access to them is limited. And it is the careers of students like these that question the myth of privatization automatically promoting a meritocratic ethos in higher education. None of these students is wretchedly poor, and all of them have been the beneficiaries of an improved access to education, up to a certain level, that social and economic progress has made possible in India. But a boy with 863 in his HS being unable to sit the joint entrance test for not being able to afford the 500-rupee application fee tells a parallel, but contrary story.

 Letters to Editor

 A crime that pays 

 Sir ? The National Commission for Women has announced a scheme which aims at doling out financial, legal and psychological assistance to rape victims (?Rape relief within weeks?, Oct 24). However, what is likely to happen as a result of this announcement is that a lot of women would now queue up outside police stations claiming to be victims of rape. Before implementing such policies, we must stop to think why crimes like rape take place. Is it because of man?s juvenile curiosity about a woman?s body, or are his unfulfilled sexual desires the reason? Perhaps this has more to do with the prevailing gender bias in India and our conservative attitude towards sex. In the distant past, women used to lead a more equal life in India. What our history shows is that education and employment opportunities for women create powerful deterrents against crimes like rape. 

 However, Indian society continues to be prejudiced against women. Female foeticide, lack of access to education, unfair inheritance laws are examples of this. Women are discriminated against even in educated Indian families. Men and women must interact more freely. Most important, we should learn to treat women with respect and dignity. The spread of modern education, which makes us appreciate gender differences better, would go a long way in fostering better relationship between men and women. 

 Rather than trying to prevent rape by generating social awareness, and encouraging responsible behaviour among men, the new policy promises money. This is tantamount to conceding that rape can occur at any time, and at any place and that the government?s job is to provide compensation to the victim. In all probability, innocent men would now be harassed by women on the lookout for the compensation-money.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Victims of rape often lack the courage to identify the rapists, and those who approach the courts for justice are made to go through hell. With the announcement of cash compensation for rape victims, a new chapter in corruption is set to begin. It is true that there is a need to provide support to rape victims. But it should not be done in the manner suggested by the NCW. The victims of rape are not participating in a contest that they have to write out application forms seeking help. They are, in fact, victims of a crime that deserves capital punishment. It would be better to have another policy for rape victims, even if that means that we have to wait for another decade. In fact, one suspects that women will not mind paying a premium for this ?policy? if they are assured that rapists will be awarded capital punishment. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sumant Poddar, Calcutta

 Sir ? The increasing incidence of rapes all over the country is really frightening. Even more worrying is the rise in rapes against minors. The Supreme Court had suggested meting out the harshest possible punishments for rapists. But it has been found that even the most severe punishments fail to act as a deterrent against rape. Therefore, there is an urgent need to think of new measures to wipe out crimes like rape from our society. 

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The spate of rapes committed by policemen in Mumbai has exposed the dismal state of affairs in the force besides raising grave concerns about the security of women. It is shocking that the police have done little to contain the upward graph of crime against women and only expressed their ?shock and disappointment? at these incidents. If the Mumbai police wants to do something about its tainted image, it should put the cases in fast-track courts and suspend the accused policemen with immediate effect.

 Yours faithfully,

Shubhajit Chakraborty, Calcutta

 Sir ? The real reason for the rise in violence against women seems to be lax laws. A person convicted of rape knows that he can get away by spending a few years in jail or by paying a fine. If the courts awarded the death penalty to a rapist, it would have acted as an effective deterrent. Human rights groups are against death penalty for rape; they argue that no one has the right to take another man?s life, and hence, rapists should be punished with life imprisonment. But what would happen if the accused manages to flee from captivity and then commit the same crime again? In some Muslim countries rapists are reportedly stoned to death. Why can?t we have the same laws to punish rape in India?

 Yours faithfully, 

Donel Kumar, Bhubaneswar

 Sir ? Hats off to the NCW for its hare-brained policies! Did its distinguished members spare a thought about the rape victim?s social stigma when they formulated the compensation scheme for rape? Or is the money supposed to take care of that too?

 Yours faithfully,

Sumati Ghosh, Calcutta

 Out of service

 Sir ? Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited is charging service tax of 10.2 per cent on the sale of modems required for its Dataone broadband connection. I have had to pay the tax. When I contacted BSNL, its officials admitted it was a mistake, but they blamed their software for it. I wish to ask everyone going in for outright purchase of modems with their broadband connections to check their bills, and claim their refund. 

 Yours faithfully,

D.R. Rao, Calcutta

 Sir ? I applied for broadband connection at 337 exchange (Salt Lake) on August 23, 2005. The modem was installed only on Oct 20 after repeated reminders. But I am yet to receive a user-identification. Which means that the connection is of no use to me. Has BSNL taken much more on its plate than it can swallow? Offering services without building the required infrastructure amounts to harassing customers. 

 Yours faithfully,

A. Bose, Calcutta

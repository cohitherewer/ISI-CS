 Letters to Editor

 Catch the star

 Sir ? This is not the first time that an Indian has made it to the international arena of sports. India has produced world-class athletes, swimmers and also tennis stars. Yet two successive stints ? one ending in failure and another victory ? have made Sania Mirza hot property (?Fame fetters Sania?, Feb 17). Why? Is it because, unlike Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi, she provides the Indian male more viewing pleasure? Or is it because middle class Sania is perceived to be more accessible?

 Yours faithfully,

M. Chatterjee, Calcutta

 Low ratings

 Sir ? It is time Khushwant Singh retires from being the self-styled literary critic he never was. He has always tried to be irreverent, posing as an iconoclast of sorts and writing on subjects he never understood. He has eulogized little-known writers whose main virtue is their shapely bodies. Once in a while Singh has written about Urdu poets, but his best pastime is Rabindranath-baiting. He has now picked up a translation of some of Tagore?s short stories which, by his own admission, does not ?read well? (?Critics beware?, Feb 12). But that does not stop him from declaring that he cannot ?rate? Tagore ?very high?. 

 Khushwant Singh mentions that he was mobbed at the Calcutta airport for being nasty about Tagore, although he is sure that those who assaulted him had not read Tagore. But has he himself? Nobody should be harassed for holding a critical opinion on anything, but can?t we hope that Singh at least reads Tagore in the original before making his deductions? There is also no reason to believe that Singh has sound knowledge of Bengali literature, both pre- and post-Tagore. Rabindranath Tagore set the trend and style of modern Bengali short stories, and some of his stories are among the best in the world. And this is not Bengali chauvinism speaking. It is a fact accepted by the world of literature. 

 Yours faithfully,

Susanta Ghosh, 

 Calcutta

 Sir ? We need not give much credence to Khushwant Singh?s assessment of Rabindranath Tagore?s literary achievements, especially given the fact that Singh?s own skills in the field are nothing to write home about. In other words, Singh is not qualified to evaluate Tagore?s literature and its value.

 Those who lack understanding, subtlety and depth should keep their criticism to themselves. 

 Yours faithfully,

A. Roy Mukherjee, 

 Calcutta

 Sir ? I read with amusement Khushwant Singh?s observations on Tagore. He is quite right in thinking that possibly many of Tagore?s works, if sent to the publisher now, would have found their way to the trash bin, particularly if that publisher happened to be Singh himself. By the same logic, Singh?s own writings would probably have been trashed had they been written a century ago. But it is still a wonder that people like Singh find time to go through Rabindranath, even if only to discredit him. Singh?s tendency to denigrate what people revere is not new. He had done the same with the Gayatri mantra. One cannot put this down to his ignorance because one has to respect his versatile genius and unhesitating entry into fields where others have feared to tread. But I wish he were more careful while commenting on men like Tagore.

 Yours faithfully,

Pijush Banerjee, 

 Calcutta

 Sir ? It is too much to expect Khushwant Singh to learn Bengali in order to appreciate Rabindranath. But has he ever suspected that the problem may lie with the translation and not so much Tagore?s stories per se?

 Yours faithfully,

N. Nag, Calcutta

 Letters to Editor

 Failing to make a difference

 Sir ? If there is one response that the story of Malati Giri elicits from the reader, it is one of disgust at the poor and insensitive reporting (?Flight from burden and bondage?, May 18, and ?By the time we wrote her story...?, May 20). Not for once in the first story did the 14-year-old come across as an individual who had lost the will to live. In fact, quite the opposite. And then we learn that she is dead, and had been so when we were reading about NGO workers theorizing about the plight of such girls. A good reporter would have been able to get the ?real? story out of Malati, the telling of which would have lightened the burden on her heart and given her the hope that there are still a few people who are willing to listen to her and make a difference to her life. Malati Giri is not a young girl we have lost, she is a girl we failed to save because we refused to hear her cries for help.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sreeradha Barua, Calcutta

 Hero remembered

 Sir ? Two points are in order with regard to Sarmila Bose?s article on Emilie Schenkl. First, the author is wrong when she says that Subhas Chandra Bose ?had very little to show for his time in Germany for his public work?. On the contrary, he raised the Indian Legion in the process of which he was able to exercise his organizing capabilities in creating a military force to fight the Allies. This exercise was to stand him in good stead later for the INA. And second, irrespective of the author?s affirming the Taihoku plane crash of August 18, 1945, even the Justice Mukherjee Commission could not determine any conclusive evidence that such a crash had actually occurred. Habibur Rehman?s so-called ?death certificate? has always been suspect. The letters between Subhas Chandra Bose and Schenkl between May 1945, when Germany surrendered, and early August, when Japan surrendered, if available, could give some indication of what the couple had in mind after the war. Could the author also throw light on where Netaji was going on August 18 and why? There has been no credible answer to this question so far. Incidentally, other than the government, no one buys the line that the leader died in the plane crash.

 Yours faithfully,

J.K. Dutt, Calcutta

 Sir ? Paul Francis Tapno could not be more wrong (?Brand equity?, May 16). Subhas Chandra Bose neither colluded with a fascist Adolf Hitler nor with murderous Japanese colonial rulers. His path to Berlin was via Moscow, to visit Adolf Hitler who had stood up against the rape of the Treaty of Versailles. Bose had the courage to admonish the Fuehrer in his own den while defending the pride of his countrymen. He never wanted to bring the Japanese into India, as his dream of the formation of an independent Indian government would vouch for. Also, the human rights records of the British Indian Army, Royal Army, the American Army are as dismal as that of the Germans, Russians and Japanese. Bose?s single-point agenda was to earn freedom for his country. He needed help to attain this goal, and it was only because his countrymen let him down that he was forced to look for help abroad. 

 Yours faithfully,

P. Banerjee, Durgapur

 Sir ? Only someone with a serious want of political understanding would consider Subhas Chandra Bose shortsighted for trying to free his captive motherland with Japanese aid. Bose?s Hitler connection too has been much misunderstood. Bose simply asked the Fuehrer to part with those Indians whom he had taken as prisoners of war ? from his encounter against Britain ? so that he could form the Indian Independence League. In the process, he saved these Indians from possible death in the hands of their captors. Bose also had the guts to tell Hitler that his invasion of Russia was wrong ? even at the risk of being held captive by the Germans. Apart from this, he never desired any aid or suggestion, military, strategic or political. 

 The Japanese showed him respect and treated him as a head of state even before his march for liberation. It is common knowledge that the first landmass acceded to India were the Andaman islands which were under Japanese occupation. Japan thought it worthwhile to unconditionally hand them over to Bose. 

 It appears to have become our national pastime to ridicule honest efforts of a handful of people. Take Krishna Bose?s recent trip (pilgrimage would be a better word) to Pakistan, retracing the route taken by Bose. Calling this an attempt to woo press coverage and gain political mileage from her family connections betrays not merely bad taste, but a lot of ignorance as well. 

 Yes, Bose has become some kind of a brand. Otherwise, why would we spend so much time delving into his death and not on the remarkable life he lived? 

 Yours faithfully,

Biplab Ganguli, Calcutta

 Sir ? Paul Francis Tapno is a believer in god and the British Empire. Now, after the wars in Vietnam, Iraq and other countries, can he really distinguish between the war-time atrocities of countries like the United States of America and Britain, and those of Japan? How is he so convinced that Subhas Chandra Bose wanted to bring the Japanese into India? Most everyone are in agreement now that Bose only tried to bring under one umbrella all the countries who were foes of the British Empire at that time. It is also not possible for a person of Tapno?s intelligence to evaluate the calculated risks that Bose took to free India from the clutches of the British.

 Yours faithfully,

Pijush Banerjee, Calcutta

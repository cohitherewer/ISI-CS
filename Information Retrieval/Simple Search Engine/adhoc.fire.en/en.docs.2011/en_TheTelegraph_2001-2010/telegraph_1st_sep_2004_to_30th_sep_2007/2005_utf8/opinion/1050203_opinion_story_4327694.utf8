 MAKE HAY WHILE THE SUN IS DIM

 GOURI CHATTERJEE

 Tuesday?s drill in Kathmandu was all too familiar. Editors were summoned to the palace and told to get their publications vetted from now on. Foreign news channels were bumped off the cable networks, websites were jammed. News was reduced to royal pronouncements. In other words, all that goes with any ?national emergency?.

 For the media in Nepal though, it need not be all gloom and doom. Censorship can do wonders for journalistic spines. The post-Emergency period remains Indian journalism?s finest hour.

 Nepal is poised just right to gain from the king?s coup. The last few years have seen a virtual media explosion there. Newspapers, FM radio, TV channels, you name it. Not all of them have been as subservient to this king as they were to his ill-fated brother. 

 Above all, there is big brother to help out. India suddenly has a stake in the prosperity of the Nepali media. Himalayan Times, launched around four years ago, is already the kingdom?s largest circulating English paper. It is, for all practical purposes, an Indian operation and has recently started a Nepali paper.

 A popular TV channel, Nepal 1, is owned by Indians (reputed journalist Nalini Singh) and beamed from studios in Delhi. Just last week, the late unlamented Deuba government had accused it of being ?partial? to the Maoists. (India government in its turn has been complaining about alleged investment by Dawood Ibrahim in Channel Nepal.)

 Maybe one day King Gyanendra?s picture will hang in the Delhi press club as an unwitting benefactor.

 People like them

 ?When I got this Page 3 idea,? director Madhur Bhandarkar said in an interview last week, ?initially I didn?t know from whose point of view we should centre the film. Should it be the driver?s point of view, an old socialite telling her story, a waiter?s? Once, after a party, I was walking on the road and I saw a photographer and a journalist catching an auto. You know, I saw them chatting with celebrities at the party, but at the end of the day, it?s only work for them. That really struck me. So I thought, why not the journalist.? With such insights into human motivations, it is not surprising that his film, Page 3, is an absolute disaster and merits no discussion at all.

 Unfortunately, the na?vet? revealed in his interview cannot be dismissed so lightly. There are many journalists who are no less foolish. They too forget that it?s their job. Fortunately, most (though not all) find it difficult to delude themselves that they are really equal to the prime minister or the economist or the industrialist their job has thrown them against. Sadly, the pretty young Page 3 things can really see no difference between themselves and those they cover, and start believing they ?belong?.

 Pay-up time

 This is for the Alipore jail and other authorities. Next time there is a Dhananjoy Chatterjee-type tamasha, take lessons from the Michael Jackson trial in California. The local administration there is making the media pay through their nose for the opportunity to cover the celebrity trial. And why not? Special arrangements have had to be made for the 1,000-odd visiting journalists. Policemen to corral and manage them, barricades and toilets to keep them in order, ?overflow? rooms for extra reporters, the list of things the media needs is mighty long. The press is grumbling. ?We are not covering this trial because we are a commercial enterprise,? Los Angeles Times quotes one of its editors as saying. ?We are covering this trial because it?s a public event of interest to our readers. And we?re covering it in a public space.? Really? Anyway, LA Times too has paid up.

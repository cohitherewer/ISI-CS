 BALANCING ACT

 As budget day nears, the United Progressive Alliance government can draw comfort from a benign macro-environment, with congratulations warranted because of the way inflation has been controlled. Figures for gross domestic product growth range from the spectacular 8.5 per cent in 2003-04 to 6.9 per cent in 2004-05 and the savings rate is 28 per cent of GDP. However, the investment rate is only 26 per cent of GDP, somewhat unusual for a developing economy and this is reflected in the sizeable current account surplus. The government may well deduce that this calls for an increase in public investment, and that this has links with the deficit targets. In budget estimates for 2004-05, a fiscal deficit-GDP ratio of 4.4 per cent was projected. For two reasons, this may well be attained. First, tax revenue has performed well, judged in terms of historical growth trends. If there is a shortfall, compared to budget estimates, that is because tax-revenue increases projected in the budget were unnecessarily optimistic. Second, high real and nominal (thanks to inflation) GDP growth has boosted the denominator, providing a stimulus to tax revenue. This, therefore, is the time to consolidate tax reforms, highlighted by the two Kelkar task force reports on direct and indirect taxes, an underlying trend in both of these being the removal of exemptions.

 That is the key to boosting the tax revenue-GDP ratio from the present 15 per cent. However, barring some exemption removals for savings, that is unlikely to happen, although some inflation indexation of thresholds is also possible. The corporate sector will want a slashing of the peak rate to unify it with the peak personal income-tax rate. While this is a valid point, because of exemptions, the effective corporate tax rate is around 22 per cent. On indirect taxes, slashing the peak manufacturing tariff to 15 per cent is possible, but might be difficult because of possible rupee appreciation. On domestic indirect taxes, pending value-added tax, more service-sector taxation and higher rates are likely. There may also be schemes to unearth black income.

 However, the key will be expenditure commitments, courtesy the national common minimum programme. The finance minister will be hard-pressed to increase public investments in physical and social infrastructure, and given the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, this will be impossible without drastic tax reform or without sleight of hand, such as dividends extracted out of public sector units and announcing policies without providing budgetary support. Nor should one forget that little will be done to improve the efficiency of public expenditure.

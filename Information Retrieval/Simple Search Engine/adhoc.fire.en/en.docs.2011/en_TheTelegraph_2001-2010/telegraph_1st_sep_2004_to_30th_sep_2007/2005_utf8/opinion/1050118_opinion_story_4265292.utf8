 WITHIN THE LAW 

 Nothing is so bitter as the wrangling that follows when friends fall out. The situation can get quite confusing when the chief minister of Tamil Nadu and the leader of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Ms J. Jayalalithaa, is one of the parties in the wrangling. For the history of Ms Jayalalithaa?s friendships is a labyrinthine one, and it takes some time to recall which side she is on at this passing moment in order to make some sense of the verbal missile-throwing. The bone of contention this time is the treatment meted out to the head of the Kanchi math when he was arrested by the Tamil Nadu police on a charge of conspiracy and murder, and later to his deputy, arrested in the process of the same investigation. The Bharatiya Janata Party feels that religious heads, revered by hundreds of Hindus, should not have been treated like ordinary prisoners and incarcerated in the jailhouse. In other words, the law can be equal for everybody else, but Hindu religious heads are a different matter. 

 Ms Jayalalithaa has given the BJP a fitting reply, repudiating the charge that she was ?driven by revenge?, and insisting that the ?maintenance of law and order makes no distinction between the rich and the poor?. Her stand is impeccable, although it is still not quite clear what exactly the Tamil Nadu police have up their sleeve in order to have ensured that the Kanchi math chief was kept behind bars without bail for so long. As a general principle, bail is not given only when there is real fear of the accused tampering with the evidence or of fleeing the police?s jurisdiction. He is now out on conditional bail. But behind the BJP?s vituperations and the righteous indignation of the chief minister is a history of two phases of friendship, both gone sour at the lady?s pleasure, and what may be called her Hindu phase, when she grew very close to the Kanchi math chief. The story so far is fascinating, with money, murder and mayhem. But more fascinating still is the other tale of the rise and fall of friendships.

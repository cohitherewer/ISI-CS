 STILL GOING STRONG

 Gwynne Dyer

 The figure of five hundred dead sounds suspiciously round, but it will stick. The regime?s troops fired heavy machine-guns into the crowd of protesting Uzbeks in the eastern city of Andizhan and launched rockets from helicopters: the death toll was certainly in the low hundreds. Besides, everybody hates president Islam Karimov (who gave himself another term in shamelessly rigged elections last December), so they are more than willing to believe the worst. The question is whether that really means he is finished.

 Precedent says yes. Three other autocratic rulers in three other post-Soviet republics have gone under to non-violent democratic revolutions ? well, more or less non-violent in Kyrgyzstan?s case, and wholly so in Georgia?s and Ukraine?s ? in the past two years. Karimov is a far nastier item than any of the other rulers, best known for his practice of boiling recalcitrant prisoners alive, so he should be next up for retirement. But he clearly doesn?t intend to go peacefully, and he may not go at all.

 Clamp down

 Karimov, an old apparatchik recycled as a pseudo-democrat, has always had a rather hands-on style of government. Opposition parties have been forbidden, civil society groups have been closed down, there are no independent media, and the predominantly Muslim population is only allowed to pray in government-approved mosques. There are an estimated 5,500 political prisoners: torture is systematic, and confessions extracted under torture are then presented to the American and Russian governments as proof that everybody who opposes Karimov is an Islamist terrorist linked to al Qaida.

 Late last year, Karimov arrested 23 prominent businessmen in Andizhan and put them on trial for being members of a party that is allegedly allied to a radical Islamist group, Hizb-ut-Tahrir, which is banned in Uzbekistan. However, these men collectively provided a large chunk of the jobs in Andizhan, a desperately poor city of about one-third of a million people, so last Thursday night a mob broke them out of jail (and let around 2,000 other prisoners out as well).

 It was mostly about jobs down to that point, but it was also a direct challenge to the authority of the state, so in came the troops, and up to half a thousand people died. The consensus says that having commissioned such a terrible massacre, Karimov should now be finished. But it ain?t necessarily so.

 Blood on their hands

 The regime?s two closest allies, the United States of America and Russia, were quick to come up with statements of support for Karimov. The US had been gradually trying to take its distance from his crimes, despite the importance of its air-base at Karshi-Khanabad in Uzbekistan to its operations in Afghanistan ? it cut $18 million from its annual $86 million in aid to Uzbekistan as a warning to Karimov to be more discreet in his repression ? but faced with the possibility of losing him entirely, Washington quickly shifted its ground.

 Karimov may get away with it, because there is an aspect of these now commonplace non-violent revolutions that is not often recognized: they do not work if the regime they are trying to overthrow is not to some extent self-deterred by its desire not to be seen as mere thugs and murderers. In particular, they do not work when the regime is confident that it will not face international isolation even if it slaughters the non- violent protestors.

 The Burmese generals got away with slaughtering thousands of non-violent student protestors in Rangoon in 1988, and they are still in power. The Chinese Communist regime did the same on Tienanmen Square in 1989, and it is still there, too. Karimov is confident that he can get away with murder, and he may well be right.

 NO RETURNS

 Power, not ideology, drives the Indian politician. Mr Raj Thackeray is the fourth Shiv Sena leader to have left the party, although his departure cannot be likened to that of the others. Certainly, the exits of Mr Chhagan Bhujbal, Mr Sanjay Nirupam and Mr Narayan Rane had come as bad shocks to the party, but Mr Raj Thackeray has long been perceived to be the true inheritor of his uncle, Mr Bal Thackeray. The latter?s decision to make his son, Mr Uddhav Thackeray, the executive president inaugurated a simmering tension that broke out into public unpleasantness with the Shiv Sena?s defeat in the Malwan assembly by-elections. The campaign was headed by Mr Uddhav Thackeray, while his cousin could address only one election meeting. 

 The feudalistic expectations generated by the inner structure of the Shiv Sena have not been fully satisfied by the anointing of the son as heir apparent, because the nephew is far more like the uncle in politics, in presence and in mannerism. But Mr Bal Thackeray has been true to the tradition of all feudal fathers. The party, already weakened by the departure of three big leaders, is now seriously threatened with inconsequence, no doubt greatly to the satisfaction of the ruling Democratic Front. The irony is that Mr Uddhav Thackeray, in spite of his lack of appeal and popularity compared to his cousin, seems to have a different image of the Shiv Sena in mind. The relevance of the violently chauvinistic Shiv Sena line has been fading rapidly. Politics without a programme, except for hysterical outbursts at anything perceived to be against a mysteriously sanctified idea of culture, cannot continue to be relevant in the rapidly changing times. The chord struck by Mr Bal Thackeray nearly 40 years ago cannot make the same impact today. To take up a hostile position on the issue of non-Maharashtrians living and working in the state, for example, may not appeal to today?s more educated and mobile young Maharashtrian. It is Mr Uddhav Thackeray who has been trying to tone down the rhetoric and approach of the party, while Mr Raj Thackeray feels that the Shiv Sena has become a party run by a coterie of clerks. He is right in saying that the party has lost direction: Shiv Sena cannot accommodate a softer tone. Mr Raj Thackeray will have to discover whether the inherited stridency can still succeed under another party label.

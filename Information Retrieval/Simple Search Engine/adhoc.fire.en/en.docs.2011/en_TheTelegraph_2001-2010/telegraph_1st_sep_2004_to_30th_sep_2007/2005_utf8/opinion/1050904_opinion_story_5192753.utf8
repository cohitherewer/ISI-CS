 Letters to Editor

 Gone with the wind

 Sir ? George Bush?s condemnation of looters in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina appears hilarious when one recalls the reaction of his eminence grise, Donald Rumsfeld, just two years ago. When asked about American troops who stood and watched the looting after Baghdad fell, Rumsfeld said: ?Free people are free to do bad things, they?re free to loot if they want.? Yet another example of what neo-imperialists would call ?enlightened double standards?, or just the white man?s contempt for ?lesser breeds without the law??

 Yours faithfully,

 Biswapriya Purkayastha, Shillong 

 Without care

 Sir ? This is in response to Verity Worthington?s letter on Donald MacIntyre?s undercover film showing the ill-treatment of disabled children in a Missionaries of Charity home (?Home truths?, Aug 10). Although one can understand Worthington?s sense of outrage, things in Mother Teresa?s homes are not as pleasant as she would have us believe. There is indeed little understanding of the needs of these special children. In 1999, along with two other volunteers, I was able to take three boys from the Howrah home of the organization and set up a residential home with a school and a training department for the staff in Salt Lake. It was an arduous task, given the costs of the project, and the legalities entailed in taking the children out of a Missionaries of Charity home. Since the setting up of the first home in Salt Lake, Brothers from the Kidderpore Missionaries of Charity have trained at Mentaid ? a special school in Behala ? and children from their home have attended school. There is also Manovikas Kendra on the Eastern Bypass, which provides for vocational training for special-needs adults, including those from Asha Niketan, a residential day-care centre for males with learning disabilities. There are parents? groups like Bodhyan, where they work constantly to create public awareness about the needs of the learning disabled. 

 We must remember that it is only in the last 35-40 years that the West has improved standards of care and education, and there are still places in eastern Europe where standards are bad. As for India, we should try to keep in mind that genuine support is not costly, although long-term care and commitment to the learning disabled are. Substantial funds are needed, alongside a band of committed and trained staff to improve conditions here, as my experience has shown.

 Yours faithfully,

Margaret Waterworth, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The report, ?Abuse charge in Teresa home? (Aug 17), on the ill-treatment of orphans in Deepashram, run by Brothers Contemplative, a wing of the Missionaries of Charity, comes close on the heels of similar charges against Daya Dan, another home run by the charity in Nimtala, Calcutta. 

 Quite obviously, a slanging match is on between the accusers and the accused. There may be some truth in the allegations since there cannot be smoke without fire. But what must be kept in mind is that those working in these orphanages face an unenviable task, given the difficult nature of the job, the paucity of funds and dearth of personnel. 

 But several questions also come to mind. Is the Missionaries of Charity run by Sister Nirmala getting less funds, now that Mother Teresa has died? And is the running of the organization suffering because of this? But the accusations should not hamper efforts to beatify Mother Teresa. Probably, the managers of the Missionaries of Charity and other associated organizations should sit together and find ways to improve their services and avoid such unwanted controversies. That would be the best way to honour the great philanthropist and Nobel laureate.

 Yours faithfully,

Ranesh Chandra Dey, Calcutta

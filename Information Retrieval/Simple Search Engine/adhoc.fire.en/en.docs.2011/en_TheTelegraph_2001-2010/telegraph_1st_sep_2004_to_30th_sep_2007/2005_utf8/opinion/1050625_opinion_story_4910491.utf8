 WORSHIPPING FALSE GODS

 THIS ABOVE ALL - KHUSHWANT 

 SINGH

 Advani?s favourite

 While L.K. Advani is busy explaining what he meant by describing the destruction of the Babri Masjid as ?the saddest day of his life? and lauding Jinnah as a genuine secularist, he has yet to explain why and on what grounds he imposed his deification of Vinayak Damodar Savarkar on the nation. He had the airport of Port Blair in the Andamans named Veer Savarkar airport and a life-size portrait of his hero hung along-side that of Mahatma Gandhi in the Central Hall of Parliament. He took the idea of Hindutva from Savarkar and described it as ?a noble concept?. The question we have to answer is, does Savarkar deserve to be honoured as a national hero? The answer is clearly no. the facts and Savarkar?s own utterances leave one in no doubt that he was not cast in the heroic role and was among many Hindu leaders, including Lala Lajpat Rai, who believed that Hindus and Muslims could not co-exist in peace in one country.

 Savarkar started off as a revolutionary in England. On March 13, 1910, he was arrested in London and sent back to India. In two trials, he was sentenced to 50 years imprisonment and sent to the Cellular Jail in the Andamans. He was unable to stand up to solitary confinement and hard labour. While most other revolutionaries remained adamant, Savarkar cracked up and decided to make terms with the British. When Sir Reginald Craddock, home minister of the viceroy?s council came to inspect the Cellular Jail, Savarkar personally gave him a petition for mercy. I quote his exact words: ?I am ready to serve the government in any capacity they like, for as my conversion is conscientious so I hope my future conduct would be. The Mighty alone can afford to be merciful and therefore where else can the prodigal son return but to the parental doors of the Government??

 His 50-year sentence was reduced to 14 and he was transferred to a jail in Maharashtra and then allowed to settle in Ratnagiri on condition that he would not leave the district or take part in any political activity. This did not prevent him from organizing the Hindu Mahasabha, converting Muslims to Hinduism (shuddhi) and exhorting Hindus to go in the defence services to fight with the British against Netaji?s INA. He also came round to the view that Hindus and Muslims were separate nationalities. In his presidential speech at the Mahasabha conference in Ahmedabad in 1937 he said: ?As it is, there are two antagonistic nations living side by side in India, several infantile politicians commit the serious mistake in supporting that India is already welded into a harmonious nation, or that it could be welded thus for the mere wish to do so. These were well meaning but unthinking friends take their dreams for realities.?

 Seven years before Jinnah and his Muslim League put up the demand for Pakistan, Savarkar in Nagpur said; ?I have no quarrel with Mr Jinnah?s two-nation theory. We, Hindus, are a nation by ourselves and it is historical fact that Hindus and Muslims are two nations.? 

 The Hindu Mahasabha had no problem joining the Muslim League government in Sind and Bengal. He was also the supporter of the princely order and thought it would not be a bad idea if the king of Nepal became the Hindu emperor of India. Thought acquitted in the Gandhi murder trial, there were many including Sardar Patel who believed that Savarkar inspired Godse to commit the foul deed.

 Growing up by the river

 The importance of rivers is mentioned in the Bible in the following words: ?It shall come to pass, that everything that liveth, which moveth, whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall live; and there shall be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters will come thither: for they shall be healed; and everything shall live whither the river cometh.? (Ezekiel 147:9)

 Come to think of it, all ancient civilizations camp up along the banks of great rivers: the Indus, Mesopotamia (Tigris-Euphrates), Pharonian (the Nile) and many others. Most great cities were built along river banks: Indraprastha (now Delhi), Baghdad, Cairo, Paris (Seine), London (Thames). They have been lauded in song and music: the Blue Danube, ?Song of the Volga Boatsmen?, ??Ole man river?. Though all rivers are cherished by people who live by them, we Indians are perhaps the only people who worship our rivers as if they were deities. Apart from the Brahmaputra who is a male river, most of our other rivers are named after goddesses. By far the most sacred is Ganga.

 I have yet to discover why the Ganga is the most revered of all rivers of the world. There are many which are broader and larger than her. There is no proof that its waters have medicinal properties. No such healing qualities are attributed to waters of canals that take off from the river or is piped into homes. Besides, it is only the earlier stretches of the Ganga as it comes tumbling down the Himalayas to the plains upto Varanasi that is accorded sanctity. As an agnostic, I do not worship the Ganga: I love it and make it a point to call on her at least twice a year at sunset time to kiss her feet.

 We have a new talented poet joining the band of Ganga worshippers. Subash Misra was born on its banks at Mirzapur, educated on its banks at Varanasi and made his livelihood in Calcutta by the Hoogly. In his collection of poems, Gangasmriti amp; Other Poems, he goes ecstatic in praise of ?Srishti: The Creation?:

 I was born on the banks of another river/ Another name for self and all of us/ I was not born in these plains ? watching your slide/ Nor did I arise where the barriers to meditation/ Are left behind. If you are looking for the root/ You will find it in ?I?nd Us. That is where/ My ancient land was before it became country,/ Nation, state, date and repeatedly rewritten history. 

 Later, from the maturing rhyme/ From the earliest of all times/ You awoke us/ Making your own sand and smiles/ Creating your own gods, grains and grass/ Gliding gently, dashing wildly, turning seductively/ Reclining piously on flowers and brass/ From sweating snows to sleepy morning dew/ From hot and humid days to a regional blue.

 A new way to pick purses

 Banto lost her purse in a DTC bus, she lodged an FIR at a police station. The inspector asked ?Madam, where did you put your purse? Banto said: ?It was a small purse, I kept it in my blouse.? Inspector: ?It is strange that a thief stole the purse from your blouse and you did not notice it.? Banto: ?At that time, I did not realize that he was stealing my purse.?

 Letters to Editor

 A world of their own

 Sir ? Despite the price tag, most in this city, and elsewhere, have managed to get their copy of the latest Harry Potter. Such is the craze. Yet common sense revolts against J.K. Rowling?s product being compared to Arundhati Roy?s The God of Small Things, which (yes!) too did brisk business. The former is pure fantasy, while Roy?s novel is social realism. One even wonders if Potter is, ultimately, healthy for young minds. Aren?t we pushing our children into a fantastic make-believe world with no sense of responsibility?

 Yours faithfully,

Shalini Gupta, Calcutta

 Easy prey

 Sir ? I am not surprised by the report, ?Molester on prowl in Presidency? (July 21). What is surprising is that such an incident did not take place earlier. On a recent visit to the Presidency College, I noticed how this eminent institution had been overrun by the lungi-clad, bare-chested, Hindi-speaking lumpens of the adjoining Kalabagan-Muchhipara-Burrabazar area. Gutka-chewing louts, in groups of three to seven, were constantly seen entering the campus through the main gate on College Street and heading for the open grounds. They seemed the real owners of the premises, while the students and professors looked like trespassers.

 It is atrocious that despite having full knowledge of these intrusions, the college authorities did not position guards at the entrance. I hope this unfortunate incident will make the college and the government sit up and take note of the sorry condition of the college.

 Yours faithfully,

Kajal Chatterjee, Sodepur

 Sir ? Incidents like the one at the Presidency College will increase, given the images the television, cinema and advertising worlds are bombarding their audience with. The snail-paced legal system and the abysmal administration further abate such crimes. But it would be wrong to blame the inept police alone. Their inefficiency would not have reached such proportions without the support of their supine political patrons. 

Yours faithfully, 

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Till recently, we knew that women were not safe on the streets, in government hospitals, or in police stations. Now we know that they are not safe even inside educational institutions. The Presidency College incident is probably the first of its kind in West Bengal. In the sprawling campuses of some of Delhi?s famous universities, which are difficult to monitor because of their expanse, there might still be a possibility of such incidents occurring. But Presidency College, Calcutta, which occupies not even a quarter of that space? Besides, why should there be need for such strict vigilance, unless something has gone terribly wrong within the college, which would suggest that such advances can be made?

 Yours faithfully,

J. Sikdar, Calcutta

 Homesick

 Sir ? The pictures of the potholed roads leading to Bengal?s technology hub in Salt Lake (July 18) say more than a thousand words. Hopefully, the government will do something about it if it wants to sell West Bengal.

 Yours faithfully,

C. Chakrabarti, Riyadh

 Sir ? Why are the innumerable BPOs in Calcutta so unwilling to take in Bengalis who reside outside the city? The state government needs to take the initiative to get the boys back home. 

Yours faithfully, 

Supratim Bose, Chennai

 EARLY GROOMING

 Confusions may be genuine, or they may be produced with the desire to obscure unavoidable truths. When the government begins to consider bringing down the legal age of marriage for men to 18, where it is now 21, unresolved problems about the age of consent, the age of marriage, their relationship to the legal age of adulthood, the high incidence of child marriage and below-18 teenage marriage, the special penalties for raping a minor demand to be addressed. Experts feel that bringing down the legal age of men for marriage to match that of women will be closer to reality. The bar at 18 for girls and 21 for boys is hardly followed, especially in rural India. It is a peculiar logic by which a law is changed because it is not followed or is not enforced. By the same logic then, there is no point to the amendment that sex with a girl under 18 should be treated as rape.

 Playing around with age will make no difference to the ugly realities. It is time that the government stopped seeking dignified ways out of the mess and began to look for ways to enforce the laws. It does not help that marriage with a girl of 16 is illegal but not void, that a court should say that a girl of 15 is old enough to know her own mind and should not be treated as a minor if she marries of her own free will ? nor her male companion prosecuted, that child marriage is practised openly and with full support from society and sometimes even the local administration, that girls are ?married? only to be trafficked. Should the laws be changed for the sake of parity with these realities? The very idea of legalizing younger bridegrooms shows a strange detachment from reality. A family, which would marry off a young man at 18, would be hardly likely to find him a bride of 18. Would that then lead to reducing the age for women? Education, employability, health and maturity should be the main determinants of the age of marriage. As it is, women are at a disadvantage: married off at school-going age or just after, it is impossible for most of them to continue studying. In the traditional set-up this implies, the man must be able to support the family. A boy of 18 would have fewer options, and would make his wife even more exploitable. Parity between the age of consent and the age of marriage, and a clear definition of rape and its penalties, would be far more helpful than unrealistic sums.

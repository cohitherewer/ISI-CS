 Extracts from the government of Indias status report on Disaster Management in India, published in August, 2004

 The institutional and policy mechanisms for carrying out response, relief and rehabilitation have been well-established since independence. These mechanisms have proved to be robust and effective insofar as response, relief and rehabilitation are concerned. The changed policy/approach, however, mandates a priority to pre-disaster aspects of mitigation, prevention and preparedness and new institutional mechanisms are being put in place to address the policy change.

 Mitigation, preparedness and response are multi-disciplinary functions, involving a number of ministries/departments. Institutional mechanisms which would facilitate this inter-disciplinary approach are being put in place. It is proposed to create disaster management authorities, both at the national and state levels, with representatives from the relevant ministries/departments...with experts covering a large number of branches. The national emergency management authority is proposed to be constituted. The organization will be multi-disciplinary with experts covering a large number of branches. The authority is proposed as a combined secretariat/directorate structure ? a structure which will be an integral part of the government while, at the same time, retaining the flexibility of a filed organization. The authority will be headed by an officer of the rank of secretary/ special secretary to the government in the ministry of home affairs with representatives from the ministries/departments of health, water resources, environment amp; forest, agriculture, railways, atomic energy, defence, chemicals, science amp; technology, telecommunication, urban employment and poverty alleviation, rural development and Indian meteorological department as members. The authority would meet as often as required and review the status of warning systems, mitigation measures and disaster preparedness. When a disaster strikes, the authority will coordinate disaster management activities. The authority will be responsible for: 

 ? Providing necessary support and assistance to state governments by way of resource data, macro-management of emergency response, specialized emergency response teams, sharing of disaster related database etc.

 ? Coordinating/mandating government?s policies for disaster reduction/mitigation

 ? Ensuring adequate preparedness at all levels

 ? Coordinating response to a disaster when it strikes

 ? Assisting the provincial government in coordinating post disaster relief and rehabilitation

 ? Coordinating resources of all government departments/ agencies involved.

 ? Monitor and introduce a culture of building requisite features of disaster mitigation in all development plans and programmes.

 ? Any other issues of work, which may be entrusted to it by the government. The states have also been asked to set up disaster management authorities under the chief minister with ministers of relevant departments (water resources, agriculture, drinking water supply, environment amp; forests, urban development, home, rural development etc.) as members. Ten states and union territories ? Tamil Nadu, Arunachal Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Orissa, Gujarat, Kerala, Nagaland, Delhi, Andaman and Nicobar administration and Chandigarh administration ? have notified the authority. The other states are in the process of setting up similar authorities. 

 Re-structuring of the relief department in the states: At the state level, the work of post-calamity relief was being handled by the departments of relief and rehabilitation. The government of India is working with the state governments to restructure the departments of relief and rehabilitation into departments of disaster management with an enhanced area of responsibility to include mitigation and preparedness apart from their present responsibilities of relief and rehabilitation. The changeover has already happened in...Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttaranchal, Nagaland, Andaman and Nicobar Administration, Sikkim and Lakshadweep. The change is under process in other states. The states have been advised to restructure/re-group the officers/staff within the department of disaster management with definite functions. The four functional groups to be assigned with specific tasks within the departments are as indicted below:

 Functional Group 1: hazard mitigation; Functional Group 2: Preparedness and capacity building, Functional Group 3: Relief and response; Functional Group 4: Administration and finance.

 IT?S JUST ANOTHER TEST

 MIND THE GAP

 Exams were different once ?they did not make or break or snuff out young lives

 Come May, and one can rely on the national television channel to bring together students to share the secrets of their success in their respective board exams with an eager audience. This year was no different. A Sunday morning saw a group of successful Delhi-board students answering a volley of mundane and unimaginative exam-related questions on Shapholyer Shirshe, a rather insipid show.

 The five young people showed us at length what it takes to be a successful student today. What they said sounded suspiciously like the introductory chapter of a management book. They informed us that time is at a premium, preparations need to be foolproof and there are no shortcuts if one were to ?realize one?s dreams?. So put in long hours, almost more than a third of the day, at the study table. Some more must be spent under the watchful eyes of innumerable private tutors, one at least for each subject, to ensure that there are no slips. And yes, the rest of the hours (if any) could be utilized in taking mock tests, conducted by coaching institutes to ready the student for the ?first real test of their lives?.

 One can imagine the inhuman grind and the sense of release after the triumph. Little wonder then that the students, quite inadvertently, let go of some interesting facts. One student said that she had to give up her much-loved karate sessions to devote more time to studies. After her exams, she loathed the sight of books, but made sure that she didn?t miss any of the entrance exams. Another said that she trembled at the very thought of her classmates ?beating? her in the race. Yet another couldn?t get enough of thanking his parents ?for taking time off their busy working lives to provide emotional support? when he needed it the most.

 They also seemed blissfully happy with their efforts bearing fruit. But very few seemed to be aware that they, along with their families, had lost a great deal to a system which makes a mockery of learning. They would scarcely believe that for a lot of students, a long time ago, a board exam was precisely what it was meant to be ? an examination. And not an event which makes, breaks, and sometimes even snuffs out young lives. Neither can they savour the ?little thrills? which examinations used to bring. The new set of sharp red and white Nataraj pencils (later, pens ? one would have to be extra careful to ensure that they didn?t leak), the shiny clip-boards with which one could make strange noises when one was tired of answering stupid (and difficult) questions, the home-made special tiffins, and, of course, the sheer delight of a little afternoon nap inside the examination halls where the sound of silence was punctuated with the footfalls of the invigilator. And some of the students from such a generation have gone on to do quite well later in their lives.

 Or for that matter, it would be quite impossible for today?s students to imagine the blithe ignorance which one showed then for alien concepts such as summer jobs or college entrance exam courses. The end of an examination was meant for indulging in a delightful holiday mood, reading Feluda?s latest adventure lying on a deliciously cold bedroom floor, impervious to the stifling summer heat outside. Or kicking around a football in the slush in the para club, during the season?s first rains. Or for that matter, coming home with a perfectly ordinary marksheet snug in the belief that all was still well with the world.

 All this might appear irrelevant to those smiling students on the television screen. It?s a pity though that they have been forced to do without some of these enchanting moments that older, luckier, men and women of another generation have got to savour.

 FALSE FIGURES

 The use of statistics by governments is not dissimilar to what the devil is reputed to do with the scriptures. India is getting ready to declare itself a nation that is free of leprosy. In a similar vein, the West Bengal government has done away with a separate department for leprosy in the School of Tropical Medicine in Calcutta, merging it with the school?s skin diseases department. The supporting argument is that India, and therefore West Bengal too, has managed to eliminate leprosy. Yet independent assessments show this to be a dangerously false claim. The World Health Organization says that leprosy has been eliminated from 108 countries out of the 122 where leprosy was considered to be a public health problem in 1985. India happens to be one of the six countries where intensive efforts are still needed to reach the leprosy elimination target. The others are Brazil, Madagascar, Mozambique, Myanmar and Nepal. This is one of the many distinguished global lists in which India takes pride in belonging. At the start of 2002, about 70 per cent of the world?s registered leprosy patients were in India. If elimination is defined as a prevalence rate of less than one case per 10,000 persons, then the figure for West Bengal is 2.14. West Dinajpur (6.67) and Bankura (6.26) are the worst affected districts. The figure for Calcutta is 3.3, with 1,327 new patients in the last one year. Officials in the state health department have claimed that compared to states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, the situation in West Bengal is much less bleak.

 These conflicting realities projected by the state and by independent reports remain India?s great misfortune. Since the early Eighties, multi-drug therapy has made leprosy a perfectly curable disease whose fabled infectiousness can be arrested quickly with the proper drugs, most of which have been made available free of cost all over the world. Yet the popular image of leprosy in India remains stuck with the brutally stigmatizing myths which make self-reporting by patients a matter of fear and shame. The state and Central governments? statistical legerdemain will only endorse this brutal situation.

 TO STEM THE FLOW

 N.K. Pant

 The confidence-building measures notwithstanding, one cannot say that cross-border terrorism has come to a complete hault in Jammu and Kashmir. Militancy cannot function without the availability of funds. If the nations fighting against the threat of global militancy can choke the pipelines that facilitate a free flow of funds to terrorist organizations, the battle will be half won. 

 The sources of funding are an open secret. Apart from charities run by wealthy Gulf nations, particularly Saudi Arabia, money is raised from drug trafficking and then channelled into madrassahs and fundamentalist Islamist political parties which pose as fronts for terrorist outfits

 A major chunk of the illicit drug business originates in the Golden Crescent ? one of Asia?s major drug-producing regions that includes Pakistan and Afghanistan. It is therefore not surprising to see that the Golden Crescent is also a hotbed of terror networks. The other known as the Golden Triangle comprises Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia and Laos. 

 Wild west

 The tribal belt in Pakistan has long been a major producer of opium. In the early Nineties, the American drug enforcement administration had estimated the country?s annual revenue from heroin sales in the range of $10 billion. The raw opium was processed into heroin at hundreds of clandestine laboratories in north west frontier provinces and in the area around Khyber Pass. The mid-Eighties witnessed a rapid growth in poppy cultivation in NWFP and Baluchistan. The higher grade heroin opiates produced here are trafficked by organized gangs with covert collaboration from local officials to Europe and the United States of America. 

 Some years back, a Russian newspaper reported that during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, Pakistan had set up a highly-developed narcotic producing and trafficking network under the control of the Inter-Services Intelligence and its army. The trafficking was used to finance the Afghan mujahedin and Kashmiri separatists, while part of the proceeds went to top Pakistani bureaucrats. 

 The US government estimated that Pakistan?s poppy crop rose to 2,500-3,000 hectares in 2003, from 622 hectares in 2002. The area of poppy cultivation is expected to go up further. The Pakistani security personnel keep arresting alleged drug traffickers but the hidden connivance of officials cannot be ruled out.

 On a high

 Recently, the Daily Telegraph reported that Pakistani traffickers play an important role in financing and organizing opium production in southern Afghanistan. This region, with Helmand as the centre of taliban-sponsored opium trade, is likely to see a bigger deployment of British-led Nato troops in the near future. The paper even had a note of caution for the coterie of generals in Islamabad. It wanted British troops to be assured of Pakistan?s total support in choking taliban?s supply lines and its large recruitment pool that the militant?s have set up with the help of drug smugglers based in Pakistan.

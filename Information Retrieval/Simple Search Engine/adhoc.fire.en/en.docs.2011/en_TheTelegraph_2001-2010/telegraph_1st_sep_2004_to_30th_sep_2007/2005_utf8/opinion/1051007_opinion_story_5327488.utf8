 FACT OF LIFE

 Facts of their lives, rather than ideologies, decide how people vote. Its resounding victory in the by-election to the Lok Sabha constituency has actually little to do with the ideology of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). The voters clearly felt that Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s zeal to bring industries to Bengal would change the facts of their lives. The vote was thus an unambiguous endorsement of his economic policies. The revival and reopening of old industrial units in and around Asansol are certainly the immediate factors for the voters? choice. The left?s successful campaigns to have the Indian Iron and Steel Company merged with the Steel Authority of India Limited and thereby stall its closure helped it in the polls, as did the coal agreement. The campaigns also helped the CPI(M) strengthen its organization in the area long before the polls. An organizationally weak Congress saw the deposit of its nominee forfeited, although the decisions on the IISCO and the coal industry were taken by the Congress-led government at the Centre. The massive victory margin of the CPI(M) candidate shows that the people have no problem voting for the government of the day if its policies help their cause. 

 However, the election had a larger story than that of local industries. The opposition parties, especially the Trinamool Congress, made it a referendum on the chief minister?s economic policies. That is why Ms Mamata Banerjee?s poll campaign focussed primarily on the investment proposals by the Salim group of Indonesia. Once again, it was not a question of a particular investment proposal or a group. Ms Banerjee actually attacked the chief minister?s new industrial and urbanization policies for Bengal. These policies, she sought to persuade the voters, betrayed the interests of poor farmers and other sections of the common people. But they emphatically rejected her case. She had to suffer another major setback, whose political impact was not confined to this particular poll. The Election Commission devised stringent new methods to ensure a free and fair poll in Asansol. The measures even seemed to have interfered with some freedoms of the voters and the political parties. The opposition will still accuse the CPI(M) of ruling Bengal with the help of rigged elections. But, after Asansol, the charge may lose much of its sting.

 PATENT SOLUTION

 The issue of patenting has always been controversial, ever since trade-related intellectual property rights became part of trade negotiations through the Uruguay Round. There are TRIPs issues beyond patents. For instance, questions about biodiversity, plant and seed varieties, data exclusivity or even copyright. However, patents become particularly contentious because of the perceived link with drug prices and public health concerns. Given the TRIPs agreement, to which India is a signatory by virtue of being a member of the World Trade Organization, there are international commitments requiring amendments to the Indian Patents Act of 1970. However, a transition period till January 1, 2005, was allowed to developing countries like India. 

 The first two amendments to the 1970 statute, in 1999 and 2002, were relatively less important, since they were primarily directed towards transitory provisions between 1995 and 2005. It is the third amendment that was expected to make the Indian patent law TRIPs-compliant, involving 20-year terms for patenting, product patents in addition to process patents, tightened compulsory licensing provisions and treatment of imports as equivalent to working of patents in India. The international commitment was initially adhered to through an ordinance promulgated on December 23, 2004. However, this had to be replaced by legislation. The National Democratic Alliance may now clamour that the bill should have been referred to a standing committee. But that is frivolous, since the original bill was drafted by the NDA. Indeed, a critical problem with the bill has got drowned in the din of debate. 

 With such a major change, the Indian Patents Act should have been completely redone. Instead, the bill amends sections of the 1970 statute, leaving other sections intact, leading to problems of inconsistency. This is linked to differing perceptions about whether patenting is good for India. If patenting is good, legislation ought to be TRIPs-compliant and even TRIPs-plus. But if patenting is bad, and is being done because of external commitments, one only does that which is required by TRIPs, often testing the waters between what is TRIPs-compliant and what is not. Since this issue was never resolved, the bill deliberately left ambiguity, hoping to address these questions through subsequent rules. With left support essential to ensure its passage through the Lok Sabha, some dilution was inevitable and this has prominently happened for pre-grant opposition. The definitions of inventive step and new invention have been refined, restricting possibilities of ever-greening, and new chemical entities and micro-organisms have been referred to an expert committee, although the Mashelkar committee had recommendations not quite incorporated in the bill. There has also been some tightening of compulsory licensing and existing manufacturing within the mailbox provisions. Multinational manufacturers and developed countries will be unhappy. But Mr Kamal Nath has worked out a reasonable compromise, given the constraints.

 Paperback Pickings

 Life ain?t a romp always

 Doctor in Clover (Rupa, 

 Rs 95) by Richard Gordon belongs to the 

 hilarious ?Doctor? series, which is now available in Rupa?s 

 edition meant for sale in the subcontinent. This one finds 

 the doctor, Gaston Grimsdyke, in Porterhampton, a suburb 

 in the Midlands ? ?the backbone of England?. With Grimsdyke 

 around, even the most tranquil of villages suddenly starts 

 buzzing with incidents. And soon, Grimsdyke has the brilliant 

 idea of turning a writer, in the august tradition of doctors 

 ?Oliver Goldsmith, Smollett, Rabelais, Conan Doyle, Somerset 

 Maugham and so on?. But that?s besides being a waiter and 

 writing obituaries and falling in love with Nurse Dulcie 

 Crimpole. The Wodehousian wit of Richard Gordon, who left 

 medical practice to write full time, is simply delightful. 

 Bloomsbury is described as ?a district with high-class literary 

 associations but now consisting of small hotels for drunk 

 Scotsmen missing the night trains from King?s Cross?. But 

 the best commentary on modern life is that ?so many people 

 ? dictators, tax collectors, tennis champions, teddy boys, 

 and so on ? seem to have no sense of humour?.

 Another cinema for another 

 society (Seagull, Rs 150) by Gaston 

 Roberge starts by laying down a set of guidelines, such 

 as ?A new cinema cannot be promoted in isolation from the 

 other mass media, particularly TV? and ?The promotion of 

 a new cinema requires that more films be made by more people?. 

 There are some interesting discussions of some of the landmark 

 films in the history of cinema: Nanook of the North, 

 Battleship Potemkin, Citizen Kane and others. 

 Students of films have much to learn from the book.

 The Second Nose and Other Stories 

 (Rupa, Rs 195) by Yashpal is a 

 collection of some wonderful short stories by the man who 

 is one of the most prominent figures of Hindi literature 

 post Mahadevi Verma. ?The Second Nose? is a love story where 

 the husband, Jabbar, cuts off his wife?s nose with the idea 

 of keeping her to himself. But horrified that she might 

 die as a result of his action, he cuts off a piece of flesh 

 from his thigh to put it where the nose was. The wound heals, 

 and a rubber nose is bought on the advice of the ?doctor 

 mem-sahib?, but Jabbar extracts the promise that his wife 

 will take it off and put it in her waistcoat pocket if she 

 finds any man staring at her.

 The Colour of Mehndi (Frog, 

 Rs 300) by Nausheen Pasha-Zaidi is the 

 story of Nazli Akram, a young Pakistani-American woman. 

 But her life, wrecked by her failed marriage and the resultant 

 despair and obsessive-compulsive disorder, is not reconstructed 

 until her youngest son discovers his mother?s audiotapes. 

 What emerges from them is the amazing story of how a whole 

 life had been kept behind the veil for years.

 Calling the Shots (Hodder 

 amp; Stoughton, ? 11.90) is Michael Vaughan?s 

 ?story as England Captain?. Quite obviously ghost-written 

 by Martin Hardy, the book is little more than a catalogue 

 of cricket played by England between 2003 and 2005. Nonetheless, 

 a good way to cash in on the Ashes victory after 16 years.

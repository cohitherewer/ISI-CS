 THE FEELING OF SAFETY IS ONLY SKIN DEEP

 ONE DAY IN THE LIFE OF

 If you are an Asian in Britain, catching a late-night film show can have its own perils 

 Under threat

 ?Wait a minute before you go down the escalator,? said Ashwin.

 We?d just finished watching the late night, and only, show of Salaam Namaste at the Odeon Skydome in Coventry. The movie was a blast, and although it was my second time, I enjoyed it as if it were my first. 

 ?Why, what?s the difference if I go down now or 20 seconds later?? was my surprised question. 

 ?Well, that family in front of you is a Muslim one.?

 ?So???

 I was rather annoyed at what I thought was my friend?s bigotry, and was gearing up to deliver a long pep talk on how we should respect fellow human beings, irrespective of what faith they belonged to. I was kind of surprised too; from what I knew of Ashwin, he was a typical economist ? rational and practical. But you never know.

 ?You don?t want to be walking too closely behind them. Those guys below might think we belong to the same family.?

 I looked down and knew exactly what he meant. The hall below the theatre was brimming with a crowd of intoxicated people trying to jostle their way through a packed nightclub entrance.

 Sure enough, when the family ahead of us reached the end of the escalator, and was heading for the exit, one guy yelled, ?What the f**k are you doing in my country? Get outta here you rascals.? Not to be outdone in displaying his machismo in front of his date, another snapped, ?You wanna come have a drink mama??, knowing full well that drinking was a strict no-no for Muslims.

 The family quietly walked to the door looking down, and swiftly headed for the car park where a few policemen were walking around.

 It was our turn now. Ashwin was a big fellow, and I was quite angry as well. But for a bunch of 6-foot something drunkards, we were no match. So we decided to avoid the stern looks, and went down the stairs. Nothing major happened, except that we got an earful of ?Go back to your own country? and ?What?re you doing here, mate? You don?t belong with us?.

 Salaam Namaste is a hit, even in Britain. The hall was full. But after the people came out, you couldn?t see a person outside the cinema within 5 minutes. An Indian (or Asian), that is. They?d rather make a hasty exit than be subjected to abuse that would ruin the wonderful evening they?d just had. And in all the years I?ve been coming to late-night movies in Britain, every time it?s been the same.

 Thankfully, we made it safely outside the hall. Now for a taxi. The taxi stand had turned into a haven of drunken people vomiting uncontrollably. So we started out on foot. But we couldn?t walk in a straight line as we had to take frequent detours, to bypass troublemakers headed our way; once we went around a hedge instead of past it lest we got drawn into a fight someone had started. 

 In crisis situations, one?s senses are heightened. My eyes zoomed in on an empty taxi from far away. Waving like lunatics, we asked the driver to stop and walked as fast as we could. Running could get us unwarranted attention, although I did feel like it.

 As we came close, we saw that the taxi-driver was Indian. He could well have been Pakistani or Bangladeshi, but I couldn?t care less ? he was an Asian. Finally here was a taxi with a desi driver who was ready to take us home.

 Of course, any taxi driver would have done the same. But there was something so comforting and reassuring about seeing a fellow Asian that hard logic cannot possibly explain. He seemed like someone from home. 

 Back home, I couldn?t help wondering what kind of life these taxi drivers had. After all, most of their passengers must be those who?d just had a drinking spree and who could utter abuse quicker than their own names. And all for a few pounds!

 You get to hear a lot of harping about how multi-culturalism has been a resounding success in Britain. It may well have been ? I?m sure most of these seemingly racist buffoons would be perfectly respectable citizens in the morning. But what?s the saying? ? a drunkard never lies. Is this the hideous truth that lies dormant in the souls of England?

 Ashwin and I will go watch Maine Gandhi Ko Nahi Mara next week. You can?t let irritants like this to hold your life hostage.

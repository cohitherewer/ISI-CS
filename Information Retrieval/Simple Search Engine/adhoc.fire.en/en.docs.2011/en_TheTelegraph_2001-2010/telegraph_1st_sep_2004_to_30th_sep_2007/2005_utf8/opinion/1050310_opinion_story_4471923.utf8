 TIME TO BRIDGE THE GOD GAP

 GOURI CHATTERJEE

 With the Page 3 revolution in the bag, will the media turn to the almighty next? It would be a stroke of genius if we could expiate our untold sins and enhance our bottom-lines all at the same time. And it is only fitting that the Times has come up with an answer.

 Not everyone is convinced that this is what lies behind the paper?s no-holds-barred celebration of Maha Shivratri on Tuesday. Why blame them, says one. The government made Shiva cool, upgrading a restricted holiday to a gazetted one this year. The Times of India simply followed suit. 

 It?s the fell hand of Mataji, whispers an insider who hopes that it is just a whimsy of Indu Jain, the deeply religious and increasingly visible mother of the brothers who reign over the Times house.

 Shiva puja has become a big thing, points out another. The public displays of fervour one sees in Delhi these days, the temples all decked out, are certainly something new. 

 It could also be that all this has simply played into the Times?s larger scheme of tapping into a god market which the media had so far left untouched. Of course, advertisements were always there, some may remember the page after page of film and theatre ads when Shiv puja meant all-night shows, at least in Calcutta. But the reports, articles and graphics in Tuesday?s Times, complete with a worldview, were quite unprecedented.

 An odd column apart, the press used to see religious rituals through its prism of news values. Kumbh melas with so much movement of men and matter were newsworthy, pujas to Ma Manasha were not. 

 But today?s zeitgeist is Anything Goes. Communists eye private capital, Mallika Sherawat talks budget, politicians play the religion card. Why can?t newspapers bridge the god gap if that?s what their readers want? That is something the Times sees as its dharma. And what the Times sees today, we all see tomorrow. 

 Free speech

 When Headlines Today announced on Monday evening, ?Himal editor Kanak Mani Dixit arrested in Kathmandu?, his many friends in Calcutta and Delhi started working the phones and e-mails rightaway. It was not long before the Committee to Protect Journalists in New York issued a statement that called for the ?immediate release of Dixit and all journalists in detention?.

 Surprisingly, he was. Upon which his first words were, ?Some of us are privileged. But make no mistake, the situation of journalists and human rights activists, especially outside Kathmandu, is anything but normal. That needs to be publicized.? No wonder Dixit is loved and respected across the world.

 Lucky Akbar?

 Whatever the truth in the reports that flooded the British papers over the weekend, naming M.J. Akbar as the father of Kimberley Fortier?s second son, one thing is patently wrong. The owner of the faltering Asian Age (?India?s biggest newspaper? according to the Evening Standard) is hardly the ?tycoon? or ?media magnate? they say he is.

 It wouldn?t have taken much to find that out. They did go to great lengths to track Akbar down in Istanbul and photograph his wife in Delhi. May be the infamous London tabloids didn?t want to know.

 They usually don?t let facts get in the way of a good (read saleable) story. And an unknown Asian can?t be sold to their ignorant working-class readers if he is only a moderately wealthy, albeit enormously successful, journalist. That is okay if you are a British like Simon Hoggart, one of the also-rans. But an Indian should have been a prince. If not, he would have to be a poor man?s Rupert Murdoch at least. Lucky Akbar?

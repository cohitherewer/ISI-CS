 Letters to Editor

 Things people say

 Sir ? Paul McCartney need not have hit the ceiling on what an American nutritionist has to say about the ethics of vegetarian parents ?depriving? their children of meat, milk, butter and cheese (?Ex-Beatle beefs up for veggie battle?, Feb 23). Americans are gaining notoriety for thrusting their myopic observations down others? necks. Remember how a Harvard chief recently insisted that women have no aptitude for science and engineering? McCartney should sit smug. Summers is already eating his words, and the nutritionist too might have a change of taste soon.

 Yours faithfully, 

Joydeep Das, Calcutta

 Green signal

 Sir ? The decision of the signatories to the Kyoto Protocol to go ahead without the United States of America is a momentous one (?Rejected by US, Kyoto rules to take first step?, Feb 16). The US?s attempts to stay far removed from the protocol is contemptible, especially given that it is one of the topmost polluters in the world. What is even more contemptible is its backing out of the proceedings on the plea that the protocol is too costly. Does it not realize that the damages to the environment are even more costly and the situation will never recover if something is not done about it soon? It could perhaps learn a lesson or two from Russia which was initially reluctant to ratify the protocol, but has now changed its mind. 

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur 

 Sir ? It is quite alarming that countries like the US should continue to ignore the alarm raised by scientists and environmentalists about greenhouse gases and the consequent global warming. In fact, so much harm has already been done to the environment that even if the US were to sign the Kyoto Protocol now, the damage will not be undone entirely. 

 Another thing needs mention. All countries across the world must, and more seriously, consider bringing down their population. Or else, human ?resources? will soon become ?liabilities?. 

 Yours faithfully,

Pijush Banerjee, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The Kyoto Protocol signals a fresh start towards ensuring a safer world for our future generations. But what exactly is the logic of the four countries, including the US and Australia, behind not ratifying the protocol? Does the planet itself have to be put at stake in the mad race for ?development?? 

 Yours faithfully,

D.K. Vidhyarthi, Muzaffarnagar 

 Sir ? Like a difficult child, the US keeps insisting that its competitors ? China and India in this case ? fall in line before it signs the Kyoto Protocol. This is far-fetched considering that its contribution to global pollution is nowhere comparable to India?s or China?s.

 Yours faithfully,

Jaya Mandal, Calcutta

 Falling behind 

 Sir ? I am an ardent racing enthusiast and normally go to the Calcutta race course on important racing days in winter. As a loyal subject, I went to the races on February 5 for the Queen Elizabeth Cup. There were six horses running in the race, four of them owned by the same owner and trainer. At the end of the race, it was found that three of those who had chances of winning were plodding a kilometre behind the winner and the runner-up, both owned and trained by the above duo. The timing was probably the slowest ever. The winner was available at 20 to 1. There were loud protests from the public, a Stewards? enquiry but the result remained the same. The cup could not be presented by Her Majesty?s representative at the paddock and I could not sing ?God save the Queen?. But many of us were sadly muttering ?God save Calcutta racing and the punters?. 

 Yours faithfully,

John Wright, Calcutta

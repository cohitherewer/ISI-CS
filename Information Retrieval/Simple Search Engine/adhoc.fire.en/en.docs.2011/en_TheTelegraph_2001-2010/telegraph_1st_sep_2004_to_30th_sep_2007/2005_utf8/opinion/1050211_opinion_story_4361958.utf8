 TEST OF SKILL

 There are two ways to look at the imbroglio over the elections to the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council. Having extended the term of the present council twice, the state government has no option but to hold the elections by March 25. But the larger and far more complicated problem is political. Not just the elections, but peace and political stability in Darjeeling could be at stake if Mr Subash Ghisingh, the council?s chairman and leader of the biggest party there, the Gorkha National Liberation Front, boycotts them. Despite the erosion in his earlier popularity, he remains the most powerful politician in the Darjeeling hills. It is possible that he is exploiting his power to make the state government fall in line with his demands. The tripartite meeting between him, the state government and the Centre in New Delhi last month sought to meet some of the demands,which seemed to be fair. Mr Ghisingh is justified in seeking punishment for those who were involved in an assassination attempt on him and the murder of three of his party colleagues. He also has a reasonable case in demanding the delimitation of some part of the council?s territory. It is also understandable why he wants the Central funds for the DGHC to go directly to it and not through Writers? Buildings. 

 However, what is less clear is why he wants the whole of Darjeeling to be placed in the category of tribal land. It stirs the old debate about whether the council should come under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution. Mr Ghisingh should know that the Nepalis are not considered tribal people and that the DGHC, therefore, cannot come under the constitutional provisions which relate to tribal autonomous set-ups. The issue seemed to have been settled when the DGHC was set up in 1988. By reviving the issue, he is clearly trying to throw up new challenges to both New Delhi and Calcutta. That precisely is the challenge before Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee ? he has to look at Mr Ghisingh?s gamble more from the larger political angle than from the strictly administrative one. He must involve the Centre closely in tackling the challenge. After all, the elections cannot be more important than peace in Darjeeling. At the same time, Mr Ghisingh cannot be allowed to hold democratic politics and peace in the hills to ransom. The stalemate clearly is a test of the chief minister?s administrative and political skills.

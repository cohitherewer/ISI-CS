 FORCED IN

 Ambiguity is essential to the existence of Taiwan and its 23 million people. Its status with respect to the People?s Republic of China has been uncertain since 1949, when the Kuomintang forces of Chiang Kai-shek sought refuge in the island after losing the civil war to Mao Zedong?s troops. Ambiguity, usually strategic, also structures the other superpower?s relationship with Taiwan. This is why the Chinese premier, Mr Wen Jiabao, is eager to make two points to the visiting American secretary of state regarding China?s new anti-secession law against Taiwanese attempts at independence. First, China does not want foreign interference, nor is it afraid of it. Second, China expects the United States of America to ?understand, respect and support? this law. The National People?s Congress, China?s gesture at a parliamentary system, has never rejected a bill in more than fifty years. This bill too had nearly unanimous support. Everybody seems to want One China, but the new bill is tougher. Rehashing earlier politburo statements, it authorizes the use of military force against Taiwan. China could use ?non-peaceful means?, if Taiwan declared formal independence, if ?major incidents? looked likely to cause a permanent separation, or if the possibilities of a peaceful reunification are ?completely exhausted?.

 This is a thoroughly regressive piece of legislation, and shows the extent to which China gets disconcerted by democracy. Taiwan?s president, Mr Chen Shui-bian, wants a new constitution by 2008, and aims to modernize political institutions, support a freer press, and reinforce human rights mechanisms. About half the Taiwanese want independence, and most others prefer status quo, particularly given burgeoning business ties between China and Taiwan (China?s biggest single investor). One would have thought that all this, together with the US?s legal obligation to provide Taiwan with defensive support, would compel China to think of peaceful negotiations towards unification. On the contrary, China is spending more money on its military, with a 12.6 per cent rise in its defense budget. There are around 700 missiles aimed at Taiwan, and a watchful eye towards Hong Kong, proof that the ?one country, two systems? solution could be a peaceful one. Ms Condoleezza Rice would therefore have to show the US?s commitment to Taiwan?s defence without tipping the balance of the US?s own ambiguously peaceful relationship with China.

 Letters to Editor

 Only corrupt

 Sir ? There has been considerable outrage after the sting operation carried out by media agencies exposed the fact that some members of parliament play the ?money for questions? game (?MP or Money for posers, Dec 13). This is not surprising, given the fact that the majority of our MPs are corrupt. The sting operation has helped to establish what we suspected all along. The outrage in parliament is the natural reaction of a group of people many of whom are thanking their stars that it was not them on the spy camera. However, at the same time that such corruptions are exposed, the bigger scandals like Bofors, LPG dealerships and petrol-pump allotments, and Volcker allegations are hushed up. Why are we not being told the truth about the more serious cases of corruption?

 Yours faithfully,

S. Kamat, Alto Porvorim, Goa 

 Sir ? Corruption is an old visitor to the two houses of parliament. It does not take great intelligence to figure out that parliamentary salaries cannot sustain the lavish lifestyle that most of our MPs maintain. But their guilt is hardly ever proved, for their position insulates them from the law. We hope that the proposed Lokpal bill will serve as a check on corruption among politicians. It is a good precedent that the president, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, has consented to bring the office of the president under the purview of the Lokpal. The government should make sure that the bill is passed as soon as possible.

 Yours faithfully,

Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

 Sir ? Accepting money for asking questions in the parliament is a petty crime and an unethical act. Our country boasts of politicians who have been accused of murders and rapes, of appropriating crores of public money. Many of them do not pay for using the public services and some of them continue to occupy government houses and bungalows illegally. Most of them use unfair means to get elected to the house. Parliamentarians and politicians need not make a show of outrage because they commit the crimes quite unashamedly. 

 Yours faithfully,

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? I did not find the damning revelations of the latest sting operation shocking in the least. It is a matter of sheer chance that some journalists were able to capture on camera the crimes which our trusted leaders commit everyday. The few responsible leaders around should take the cue from this scandal and take some bold measures to keep corruption in check. The government itself might consider using spy cameras to put fear in the minds of politicians.

 Yours faithfully,

Salil Gewali, Shillong

 Sir ? It is a matter of shame for the nation that 11 ministers have been caught on camera, taking bribes for raising particular questions in the house. Six of the politicians are from the Bharatiya Janata Party, one from the Congress, one from the Rashtriya Janata Dal, three from the Bahujan Samaj Party and two are former Union ministers. Since four different parties are involved, no one is making much noise, trying to save each other?s back. The involved parties have suspended their MPs, but as soon as the storm blows over, the suspension might be nullified. Suspension is not an adequate punishment for greedy politicians for whom money matters more than the country. Such individuals should be banned totally from national politics.

 Yours faithfully,

Mohd. Mudassir Alam, New Delhi

 Sir ? The editorial, ?Dirty eleven? (Dec 14) is right about many corrupt MPs falling outside the trap laid by journalists. One of the common malpractices of our politicians is the five-star hospitality they demand while on tour as committee members. There is no reason why such expenditures should be allowed. Such offences cry out for stronger punishment than suspension.

 Yours faithfully,

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? The power to question any and every activity of the government is vested with all members of parliament. It is by raising questions of public interest that an MP discharges his duty to his electorate and keeps the government on its toes. But the 11 MPs who have been caught accepting money on camera for asking questions in the house stand shamefully exposed as bereft of all scruples. Their despicable act has cast a shadow on the integrity of the parliament as an institution. They should be dismissed from the house with immediate effect. 

 Yours faithfully,

Megha A, Hyderabad

 Sir ? I salute the hard-working, resourceful and diligent journalists who have done yeoman service to the nation and its people by exposing 11 corrupt MPs. The media have used their power in the most positive way in this case. 

 Yours faithfully,

Amit V. Sengupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? Not all the questions for which 11 MPs had allegedly taken bribes were raised in parliament, and the ones raised were petty ones. Nor did the answers given by the ministers violate any code of conduct. Apparently, this was a scheme of the so-called investigative journalists to defame the ministers. The report does not say how many ministers refused to take bribe from the journalists. Besides, if corruption is a way of life in India, then it is obvious that it will be reflected among ministers and MPs too. Are journalists themselves immune to the lure of money? But who will expose them? 

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

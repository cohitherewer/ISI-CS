The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 It is a truism that there is no such thing as a voluntary strike. A handful of activists enforce a strike and keep others from doing their work. The strike in Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited was by a handful of executive officers but they did manage to bring telecommunications in Calcutta and in West Bengal practically to a standstill. The strike has now been withdrawn and this will bring relief to everybody. The impact of the strike affected mobile phone services and the internet. Business activities were obviously hit but so were essential services like hospitals, the fire brigade, airports and so on. The strike thus disrupted the lives of people who were in no way involved with the dispute the disaffected officers of BSNL had with the authorities. Theoretically, the success of a strike is determined by the public sympathy it enjoys. In the case of the BSNL executives, they lost all public sympathy since they only thought about their own vested interests and ignored the widespread harassment their action was causing.

 It has never been anybody?s case that workers and employees should not have the right to campaign and agitate for their rights. This might even lead to a strike in a democracy. The words, ?in a democracy??, are crucial. In a democracy, the decision to strike must be taken through democratic means and not enforced. Similarly, the decision to strike should not impinge on the democratic rights of others. If BSNL workers have the right to strike, then a BSNL subscriber, who pays his dues, has the right to enjoy uninterrupted telephone services. In radical rhetoric, such issues are always brushed aside. The right to strike is always more than a telephone call away.

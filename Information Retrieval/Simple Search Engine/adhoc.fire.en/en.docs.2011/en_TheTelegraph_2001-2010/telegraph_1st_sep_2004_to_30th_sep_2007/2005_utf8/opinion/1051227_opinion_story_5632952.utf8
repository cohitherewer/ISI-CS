 Letters to Editor

 Caught in the act

 Sir ? The premeditated way in which couples, including married ones, were beaten up and humiliated in front of television cameras in Meerut?s Gandhi Bagh is shocking (?Cops thrash park couples?, Dec 20). It is obvious from the incident that the police were out to prove that they are the moral guardians of our society. TV footage showed how they turned a deaf ear to the girls? pleas of innocence and abused the married couples. This is a gross abuse of the power vested in the police by the government. One despairs to see the protectors of the public turning so easily into tormentors. The public outrage against the police barbarity was entirely justified. 

 One fails to understand how such an incident could have taken place without the knowledge of the district superintendent of police, since the police personnel engaged in the drive could not have acted on their own without the consent of their superiors. It seems that DSP, R.R. Verma, is lying in order to save his skin. Although four officers have already been suspended, they should be made to apologize in public, and preferably be beaten and abused (covered by the media, of course) by the young men and women whom they harassed only a few days ago.

 Yours faithfully,

Bipasha Lahiri, Hyderabad

 Sir ? On the pretext of driving eve-teasers out, the Meerut police acted in an irresponsible manner by beating up couples for showing the remotest semblance of coziness in a public place. The way young couples were treated by the police inside Gandhi Bagh shows that lessons in sensitization were not part of their training. While the police are spectacular failures at catching the real criminals, their high-handedness with law-abiding citizens is despicable. The Latin saying, to the effect that the guards themselves need to be guarded, is most pertinent in this context.

 Yours faithfully,

Barun kumar Mahapatro, Berhampur, Orissa

 Sir ? There is no law in the country which prevents men and women from meeting in public places. Neither is there any law which can penalize them for showing their affection for each other in public. The police have no right to interfere in the private lives of people unless one of the parties involved solicit their help. In the case of Meerut, some young couples were just enjoying their day out when the police burst unexpectedly upon them and harassed them in every possible way. What will they do next? Make sure that men and women follow their diktat inside the bedrooms too?

 Yours faithfully,

Deepak Lall, Perth Amboy, U.S

 Sir ? Watching images of a policewoman slapping young girls at Meerut?s Gandhi Bagh reminded one of the taliban regime in Afghanistan. After seeing this, the rest of the world is bound to get the impression that young men and women are prohibited to meet and talk openly in public places in India. In this case, it was the police who were violating the law by intruding into people?s private space. Such shameful behaviour on the part of the law-keepers tends to make us forget that every person has the right to individual liberty in a democratic country, so long as that does not infringe upon the rights of others. 

 Yours faithfully,

Mahesh Kumar, New Delhi 

 Sir ? Even though the National Human Rights Commission has taken note of the atrocities committed by the police of Meerut on innocent couples, and the involved officers have been suspended, the Uttar Pradesh chief minister has not shown enough involvement in or outrage over the matter. Did he then actually support what the police did on December 24?

 Yours faithfully,

Subhash C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir ? Women?s commissions, human rights activists and the media have all condemned the action of the Meerut police in the name of ?Operation Majnu?. But what about the adverse effects of Western culture which have infiltrated our society through satellite television channels and Bollywood movies? These days, urban boys and girls, more at ease with their bodies, have no qualms about making gestures of love in parks and other public places, following the practice in Western countries. Instead of paying attention to studies and broadening their horizons, they are found to waste their time chatting on the internet, or visiting pornographic websites, or indulging in licentious acts. The policewoman did nothing wrong in slapping girls if the latter were indeed involved in immoral acts.

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? Instead of acting the way they did, the Meerut police should have thought carefully and adopted proper measures if they really wanted to put a check on amorous acts in public places. Influenced by Western films and soaps, young Indian boys and girls sometimes cross the bounds of public morality. Their behaviour might seem outrageous to a passer-by. If traditional Indian values are not properly instilled in the minds of our young citizens, our society might soon lapse into anarchy.

 Yours faithfully,

Salil Gewali, Shillong

 Sir ? The Meerut police have proved that it is they, and not the young couples in Gandhi Bagh, who have committed acts of ?moral turpitude?. It is time for the Uttar Pradesh government to curb the force?s attempt at moral policing by making them accountable to the public for each of their actions. The recent popularity of sting operations probably inspired the policemen to invite TV crew. Hopefully, the action will adequately backfire on them.

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad

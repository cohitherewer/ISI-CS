 TO HEAL THE WOUNDS 

 Blood and tears

 Low intensity conflicts in India: An analysis

 By Vivek Chadha,

 Many parts of India have witnessed insurrections since the years after independence. The Indian army, unlike the armies of other great powers, has been constantly engaged in peace-enforcement duties. Due to intense and continuous pacification campaigns, the army has become more of a militarized police force rather than an instrument capable of conducting warfare within a high technology context.

 Numerous books have been written both by analysts and former military officers about the various aspects of anti-insurgency operations in different states. In the same vein, Vivek Chadha provides a detailed historical analysis of the various insurgencies that have taken place in the sub-continent. Unlike other military officers, Chadha not only concentrates on the military dimensions but also discusses the social and economic aspects behind the rise of insurgencies.

 According to Chadha, ideas as well as material forces give rise to insurgencies. India, writes Chadha, has inherited many of these rebellions from the raj. For example, the British never brought the Nagas under their direct rule. In return for subservience to the Central government, the Naga chiefs were allowed to enjoy autonomy. But independent India?s attempt to bring the Nagas into the mainstream resulted in the erosion of the Naga chieftains? power. In retaliation, a large number of Naga tribes now speak in the language of the gun.

 Chadha warns that the Indian government?s policy of playing one terrorist group against another will not pay in the long run. The disaffected insurgent group will always try to break the peace negotiations by indulging in abrasive terrorists acts. Rather, a more fruitful policy, says Chadha, will be to negotiate with all the players in the troubled region. Sound governance and financial aid, in addition to a moderate display of force, are the principal mechanisms for combating insurgency. There is little doubt that certain foreign powers play an important role in sustaining insurgencies in India. But fuelling trouble in neighbouring countries will not eradicate India?s problems, says Chadha. Diplomatic negotiations to counter terrorism is probably more productive, adds the author.

 Not just Kashmir or the states in the North-east, there are other areas in the country which may experience militancy in nascent forms sooner or later. These areas include northern parts of West Bengal, Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh. If the government does not deal with the disaffected groups in these regions right now, the future might see the deployment of armed forces in them. The Gorkha problem, caste violence in Bihar and the Naxalite menace in the south have to be met in a decisive manner before the ongoing conflicts become unmanageable. The Bourbons learnt nothing, forgot nothing. But, Indian policy-makers learn nothing and forget everything. Since the Indian government?s record is worse than the Bourbons, it is better for the nation that the government takes into account these problems as soon as possible.

 One of the main problems that prevents India from becoming a superpower in the new millennium is the prevailing insurgencies. They have the potential to tear the heart out of the Indian state which is composed of many nationalities. Instead of a knee-jerk reaction, the government must learn to act wisely to prevent disaffection from welling up in a particular region. A coherent counter-insurgency policy for India is, therefore, a necessity and not a luxury.

 Rather than blaming the politicians for all the ills of the society, a trend popular in the media, Chadha brings into focus structural factors which are the driving forces behind insurgencies. Chadha?s meticulous research would put many renowned academics to shame. Similarly, the author?s exhaustive analysis of the prospect of a ?civil war? within India is likely to interest scholars, policy-makers and discerning readers alike.

 SCIENCE OF KILLING 

 Written in stone 

HINDU ARMS AND RITUAL: ARMS AND ARMOUR FROM INDIA 

1400-1865 

By Robert Elgood,

Mapin, Rs 3,500

 Historians have always believed that the south Indian polities were technologically backward and that new kinds of weapons were introduced among them by the Muslim rulers of the north. Contradicting this view, Robert Elgood asserts in this book that south India had a dynamic tradition of producing various kinds of military hardware, few of which have survived. For one, the monsoon rains led to the rusting of the iron weapons. Two, the British, determined to disarm the Indian people, destroyed most of the arms. In fact, the East India Company melted down countless swords and shields which it sold as scrap. Three, the British ruling elite sequestrated weapons from the private armouries of kings and took them home. Many of these can now be seen in private collections and museums in Europe and America. Comparing the few scattered pieces in existence with the sculptures in temples, Elgood tries to chart the evolution of the weapons of south India.

 Historians had also long held the idea that Hindu weapons were governed by aesthetics and were not very effective in combats. Such an interpretation is certainly overdrawn and arose because only the weapons studded with precious stones which belonged to the rulers have survived due to their intrinsic value. But it is clear that the process of secularization of European arms and armours, which began after the Renaissance, did not occur in pre-British India. The Hindus and Muslims considered military hardware as part of their religious ethos. The Hindus believed that weapons were the dwelling places of gods and that religious motifs would protect the warriors. Through the iconography on the weapons, the warriors expressed their spiritual loyalties. 

 The Cholas introduced the tiger symbol in weapons, which continued under Tipu Sultan. Ancients also Hindu believed that gems warded of evil spirits which explains why the swords of rulers had precious stones on their hilt. The Bahmanis and the Mughals continued this tradition.

 The kingdoms south of the Vindhyas evolved many types of swords and daggers which were adopted by those in the north. For example, the arms produced by the Cholas in the Sangam age was adopted by the Hoysalas and from them, passed on to Vijaynagara and then on to the Bahmanis and later the Mughals. Elgood quotes medieval Islamic writers who noted that Damascus blades were made with steel imported from south India. The straight-bladed swords known as khandas, which the Rajputs adopted from south India for close combat, were in no way inferior to the Persian single-edged curved swords ? tulwars ? with which the Delhi Sultanate?s cavalry was armed. 

 In south India, shields were made by boiling buffalo and rhinoceros hide in oil. This tradition spread to Kutch and thence north India. Such leather shields could stop bullets fired from 18th century muskets. 

 The history of arms and armour remains an exotic subject even among scholars of military history. Elgood?s monograph, which places pre-modern south Indian military equipment within the social and religious context, will probably bridge this gap.

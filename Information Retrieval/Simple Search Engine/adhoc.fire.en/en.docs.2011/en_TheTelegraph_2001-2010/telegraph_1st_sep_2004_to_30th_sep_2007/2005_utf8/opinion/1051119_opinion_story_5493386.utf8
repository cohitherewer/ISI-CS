 LIVING IN GLASS HOUSES

 This Above All 

/ Khushwant Singh

 Pleasure and pain

 According to an old proverb, those who live in glass houses cannot afford to throw stones. I was reminded of this when I heard Arun Jaitley and Sushma Swaraj denounce the United Progressive Alliance government and the Congress party for not throwing foreign minister, K. Natwar Singh, out of his post for what his son Jagat and his friend Sehgal had done in the United Nations-sponsored oil-for-food programme launched by Saddam Hussein, the then president of Iraq. Did it not occur to them that their party leaders like L.K. Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi and Uma Bharti were actually charged of a more heinous crime than condoning his son?s and his friend?s suspected misdeeds? No. It never occurs to our politicians that they all live in glass houses and, nevertheless, indulge in rock-throwing with irresponsible abandon.

 I hold no brief for Natwar Singh. He has a very high opinion of himself which none of his colleagues in service with him shared: they referred to him as Nit-wit Singh. He also has aristocratic pretensions and adds the letter ?K? standing for Kunwar (Prince) to his name. Actually, he is only an aristocrat by marriage: his wife is the daughter of Maharaja Yadavindra Singh of Patiala and sister of captain Amarinder Singh, chief minister of Punjab. He also professes to be a man of letters and has a few books of little consequence to his name. All this makes him arrogant and pompous. He has a piercing look to add to his self-esteem. He is madly ambitious and has got where he has by hitching his wagon to the rising star in Indian politics, Sonia Gandhi. His claim to having an impeccable record is flawed by some scandalous episodes which were kept under wraps by the ministry of external affairs to preserve the prestige of the foreign service. In short, he is an unsavoury character. However, none of this is pertinent to the hitherto unsubstantiated charges against him. What was pertinent is should he have remained foreign minister in a government which did not share his views on foreign affairs? There were a few important international conferences in the offing where his views would have given a false picture of the government?s intentions. And in the winter session of the parliament, he will be a sitting duck for the opposition and put Manmohan?s government in an embarrassing position.

 Love and other demons

 Gabriel Garcia M?rquez, author of One Hundred Years of Solitude, was awarded the Nobel prize for literature in 1982. His latest offering is Memories Of My Melancholy Whores. It is about a journalist who writes a column everyday for the leading paper of his city. He spends his nights in the red light district in different brothels. He started early ? from the age of 12 ? and continued his daily routine all his life. He insisted in paying for his pleasures because then there were no emotional hassles involved. Once, while at home, his laundry woman who washed soiled clothes and linen, while she was bending over the laundry basket, bared the rear of her thighs and part of her buttocks. Our hero got so excited that he jumped off his hammock and entered her from the rear. The washer woman protested mildly that it was not the right way to do things but let him do it his way once a week. He had also sodomized boys at school. He jotted down names of whores he had laid. After 514 he lost count. When he came to his 90th birthday, he asked the madam of the brothel house he had patronized more than others to send him a virgin. For the first time in his life he fell in love with the teenager. He was no longer able to perform but made up by staring at her naked body while she slept. The moral of the story, if one can use that word, is ?sex is the consolation you have when you can?t have love.? However, in his case, it is the other way round: when he falls in love he is unable to have sex.

 I am unable to fathom reasons which induced M?rquez to write this novella almost entirely confined to prostitutes. The urge to write about my own fantasies came to me when I was in my 80s. I churned out The Company of Women. I wrote a short prefatory note admitting that when a man ages, his sexual desires travel from his middle to his head. And all that I have written were imaginary sex-escapades of an octogenarian. Needless to say it was panned by most critics, and predictably also went into several editions. M?rquez?s latest will make it to the top world?s best-seller list and earn him another fortune. It does not shake me. My consolation is that I did a better job than he even if the world does not agree with me.

 A nation of cheats

 Kunji Lal said, ?Come what may,

 My stars tell I will die today.?

 His prediction proved wrong like a mythical lore.

 He is still alive and kicking as before.

 A swami said, ?For my ashram, give donation.

 I assure you, you will go straight to heaven.?

 Both the swami and the ashram are doing well.

 But his devotees are rotting in earthly hell.

 A neta said, ?If I win the election race,

 India will shine like Luna?s face!?

 To the voters, he made promises big and tall.

 When he became an MP, he forgot them all.

 A common trait of our character is deceit.

 Wherever we go, we find a cheat,

 Still, how marvellous! From dusk to dawn,

 We live happily in our desh mahan.

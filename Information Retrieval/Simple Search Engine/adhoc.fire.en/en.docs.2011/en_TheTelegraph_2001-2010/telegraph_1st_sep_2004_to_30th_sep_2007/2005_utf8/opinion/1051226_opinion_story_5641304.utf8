 CAREFUL ADVANCE

 Diehard romantics may see it as the end of an idyll. But the decision by King Jigme Singye Wangchuk to usher in parliamentary democracy in Bhutan speaks of his astute political sense. The decision is neither sudden nor impulsive. His long reign over the tiny Himalayan kingdom bears ample evidence of his passion for merging tradition with modernity. For a country that was closed to foreigners for centuries and where serfdom was abolished only in 1956, the last two decades saw dramatic changes. The first hint of a modern political system came in 1981 when the king introduced 20 elected district committees. Ten years later, decentralization and public participation in local governance were extended to 201 committees representing blocks of villages. The country?s isolation from the outside world ended with the introduction of television and internet in 1999. Finally, he set in motion the all-important process of the drafting of a constitution that provides for a multi-party democracy and a constitutional monarchy. Sceptics may point to neighbouring Nepal and argue that the transition from absolute monarchy to parliamentary democracy has hardly been a success in that other Himalayan kingdom. It is risky to predict how the democratic age will unfold in Bhutan. But there is little doubt that Bhutan?s king has taken pains to prepare the kingdom for the big leap forward. 

 For all the king?s attempts at modernization, though, Bhutan is no fairy-tale land. Most of its inhabitants live in crushing poverty. Its first paved road was built only in 1961. Its first bank was set up in 1968. The economy is still struggling to emerge out of primitive agriculture. The United Nations human development index ranks it among the poorest countries. All this suggests how difficult the road ahead will be for the Crown Prince, Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuk, when he takes over the reins from his father in 2008. Not only he but also Bhutan?s would-be politicians can learn important lessons from Nepal?s unhappy experiences. They will have to learn how to use democratic politics for the economic good of the people. Also, they will have to acquire diplomatic skills in order to integrate with a globalized world. For New Delhi, which has had a special relationship with Thimphu since 1949, a democratic Bhutan may offer new opportunities as well as challenges in regional diplomacy.

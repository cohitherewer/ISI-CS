Are other worlds possible?

 Collected plays, volume 2 (Penguin, Rs 450) by Mahesh Dattani brings together some of stage-, radio- and screenplays of this ?Indian playwright in English?. A running presence throughout this volume is that of the executive producer of BBC radio, Jeremy Mortimer, who is an admirer of Dattani?s plays and has commissioned several in this volume for Radio 4. Natural disasters (e.g. Bhuj) and ?issues? (sexual identity, religious faith, family ties) seem to be the specialities of this volume. There are the Uma Rao plays, featuring the Bangalorian female sleuth, and the screenplay of that echt Bad Film, Morning Raga. Five-star hotels and clubs are now the great patrons of English-language theatre in Indian metros. Many of Dattani?s plays are tailor-made for such venues. Mortimer detects the influence of Tennessee Williams on Dattani. Why do mediocre (and worse) playwrights all over the world, wishing to explore ?issues? of sexual identity and wanting to portray diva-like women, inevitably take to Williams and banalize his genius?

 Are other worlds possible? Talking new Politics (Zubaan, Rs 195) edited by Jai Sen and Mayuri Saini asks, in its introduction, ?Are other worlds possible? More open, just, peaceful and joyful worlds than we know today: less violent, divided, and exploitative worlds?? It collects critiques and interviews from the Open Space seminar series held in Delhi University during the run-up to the Mumbai 2004 session of the World Social Forum. Eminent contributors include Nivedita Menon, Veena Das, Urvashi Butalia and Dilip Simeon. Nivedita Menon: ?[The WSF] has distilled...certain kinds of voices of dissent, and voices that have challenged hegemonic commonsensical notions.?

Maya running (Puffin, Rs 250) by Anjali Banerjee presents, for young readers, the irrepressible Mayasri Mukherjee, born in India and raised in a Canadian town. She is the only brown teenager in her school, but cannot speak Bengali. Just as she captivates the gorgeous Jamie Klassen, her beautiful cousin, Pinky, arrives from India, and Jamie falls for Pinky?s long hair, sandalwood fragrance and dancing skills. But Maya discovers Pinky?s little idol of Ganesh, and pleads with the Remover of Obstacles to remove all the barriers to her happiness, a plea which backfires in hilarious and painful ways.

 OFF-SIDE ON A FOREIGN FIELD

 MIND THE GAP

 Foreign footballers are welcome in India. But only if they get their act together on the field

 Subrata Dutta, vice- president of the All India Football Federation, has got it only partially correct. An elated Dutta had described the day on which the AIFF decided to revoke the proposed ban on foreign footballers in the Calcutta league and shield tournaments as ?a great one for Bengal?. A great day it was, but not just for the reasons cited by the jubilant vice-president. In a rare gesture, the executive committee of the footballing body has now decided to ensure that the Maidan is free of painfully mediocre foreign talent trying to make it big in India. 

 The AIFF came out with a stringent directive after a two-hour long deliberation. According to the new rules, before a foreign player is registered to play for an Indian club, he has to furnish details about his background. Apart from documents certifying the player?s health and fitness, he has to inform the concerned authorities whether he has represented the national side before. Footballers who are embroiled in legal battles will be debarred from donning the colours of an Indian club. Not just that. Foreign players, who want to play in India, would now be allowed to stay on in the country as long as their visas allow them, and not a day more. The officials seem to have learnt their lessons from the tragic death of Enyilord Lawrence, a young Nigerian footballer, whose body lay unclaimed in a city morgue as he was an illegal immigrant in the eyes of the law. And the authorities would also like them to clarify whether they are amateurs or professionals in the first place.

 This, one suspects, is bad news for players like the Nigerian defender, Ajibade Olaniran Babalade. The player, who was paid much more than some other local players, was ushered in with great fanfare by one of the big clubs in Calcutta. Babalade, however, got his moves completely wrong from the onset. Not only did he collapse due to exhaustion during a practice session, he was also sidelined with jaundice and niggling injuries for much of the season. The player, clearly past is prime, ended up running after scheming strikers instead of foiling their attempts on goal. The spectators may have laughed at the old man?s antics. But the coach and the club officials were not amused.

 Meanwhile, the club?s archrival, on the other end of the Maidan, had little to cheer about. Neither Roberto da Silva Paolo, nor Ernest Jeremiah, who was roped in later, were anything to write home about. But this is hardly surprising. Over the years, an increasing number of foreign players have been trying to fleece Indian clubs, all of which operate on a tight budget. But one can hardly blame these players alone. The clubs? recruiters are equally guilty of forwarding the wrong resum?s, unmindful of the drain on limited resources. 

 It is true that not all foreign footballers have been as pedestrian. Many old timers would recall the wizardry of the Iranian, Majid Baskar, in the early Eighties. More recently, we had Jos? Ramirez Barretto,who entertained the crowds with his nimble footwork. But the Baskars and Barrettos are very much the exceptions, and not rules, that govern club football in India. The AIFF rider, if implemented properly, may turn things around though.

 In fact, the new rule would complement the decision to rescind the proposed ban on foreign players. There is a need for good foreign players in India. They can bring back the crowds to the now near-empty stands. Corporate sponsorship, so vital to bring in the much-needed funds, may become a little easier, once we have bigger names from abroad playing in the teams. And all this talk about foreign footballers being detrimental to the prospects of our sons of the soil is pure drivel. Indian players can only benefit from playing alongside foreigners who are better than them. At a time when sides from Britain and Italy are showing an interest in tie-ups with Indian clubs, and the national team has a foreign coach, how could one justify a ban on foreign footballers?

 The AIFF ruling should gladden the hearts of football fans, not just Dutta?s. Simply because run-of-the-mill foreigners kicking ball would now hopefully become a thing of the past.

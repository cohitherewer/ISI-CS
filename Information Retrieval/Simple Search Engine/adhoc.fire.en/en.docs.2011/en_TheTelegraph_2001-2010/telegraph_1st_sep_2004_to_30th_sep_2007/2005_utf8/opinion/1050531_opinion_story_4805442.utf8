 LOVE HURTS

 India is becoming crueller to its children. Perhaps there are too many of them everywhere ? miserably poor and with absolutely no power to choose not to be born. The National Crime Records Bureau has revealed that violence against children has increased significantly ? despite 22 laws, six national policies, a children?s charter, talk of a national commission for children, and the Convention on the Rights of the Child that India ratified in 1992. The bureau?s figures show that the number of cases of abuse and neglect, particularly within the family, has gone up from 6,866 in 2002 to 8,064 in 2003. This must be only the tip of the iceberg, since much of this abuse remains unreported and invisible. The most marked increase has been in rape and kidnapping, followed by trafficking and murder. Anybody working with children and their rights will know that ?protection? and cruelty go hand in hand here. Hence, the most protective of institutions ? the family ? remains the most darkly implicated in this violence. The extent of sexual abuse, together with physical and emotional exploitation, within the family, both of its own members and of minor ?domestics?, is only now beginning to be acknowledged and addressed. The school is another site of abuse. Teachers given to violent disciplining, and a corrupt education system pathologically focussed on performance and competition are on the rise, very noticeably in West Bengal, across the entire social spectrum.

 Yet, the violence of the State must not be overlooked. Not only are Indian laws ? adoption laws, for instance ? still to catch up with the fullest implications of child rights, but their implementing bodies are also often perpetrators of brutality against children. In Bengal again, the remand and observation homes required by the Juvenile Justice Act remain infernal institutions fostering every kind of cruelty, corruption and neglect, and an honest recognition of this appalling reality by the government is still awaited. Law-keeping bodies like the Railway Protection Force, the Border Security Force and the police are yet to be properly sensitized regarding the rights of the child. It is when the impersonal cruelty of poverty and inequality combines with the sentimentalized brutalities of ?protection? and of ?love? that the child must watch out. But a child that is watching out is no more a child.

 Letters to Editor

 Everyman?s hero

 Sir ? Sachin Tendulkar?s statement, ?People seem to have decided a lot of things for me? (?Quote?, June 28) , transcends the context in which it was made. Only those who have been dispassionately following the little master?s career right from his debut can decipher the hidden anguish. Indeed, people seem to have decided a lot of things for Tendulkar. For example, some have decided that he is past his prime and does not play as aggressively as he used to. Some even find flaws in his techniques, forgetting this is the man who has got a record number of tons in both forms of cricket. This is profanation of the highest order considering his achievements. Simply put, the man needs to be left alone. Some people know when to shout but it?s more important to know when to keep mum.

 Yours faithfully,

 Amita Behera, Ranchi

 Ill-gotten, ill kept

 Sir ? Transparency International?s revelation that Rs 21,068 crore is paid every year by Indians as bribe is truly alarming. The only way to check this is by drastically reducing currency circulation. Here are some measures the government may consider in this regard ? all expenses above Rs 1,000 to be made by cheque; a currency tax on all transactions exceeding, say, Rs 20,000; reporting all cash withdrawals exceeding Rs 20,000 in a single day to income-tax authorities. Confiscating the property of the culprits and their near relations is another measure that may work. 

 All Indians must feel ashamed that by Transparency International?s corruption perception index, India is ranked 90th in the world, with just 2.8 points out of 10. The only consolation is, we are less corrupt than Pakistan and Bangladesh. Our politicians and bureaucrats are fond of going on ?study tours? abroad at public expense ? why not send a high-level delegation to the world?s most honest nation, Finland, with a CPI of 9.7? 

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi 

 Sir ? Corruption is not a new phenomenon ? it is, and always has been, a way of life in India (?Corrupt to the bone?, July 3). People here, even when praying to god for something, promise to repay him if their wish is fulfilled. 

 Yours faithfully,

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? That there have been no concerted efforts to check corruption among politicians is well known and borne out by the millions in unaccounted money spent during elections. There is also no surprise in Bihar emerging the most corrupt state in India, as per the latest Transparency International report. But what is strange is that Laloo Prasad Yadav, whose Rashtriya Janata Dal ran the state until recently, continues to have the blessings of both the Congress and the left. Obviously, the latter are prepared to condone all misgovernance and corruption in their bid to keep the BJP out of power. As for West Bengal, its eighth position in the list can be attributed to the inaction of the state vigilance department. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.K. Das, Calcutta

 Sir ? For the sake of their country and economy, all Indians must join the fight against corruption. They must pledge not to pay bribes, either to save time or because they could not get their work done in one or two visits, and to report all corrupt officials to the higher-ups. Of course, the murder of Satyendra Dubey shows that bringing corruption charges against powerful persons can have fatal consequences. Thus the government must put in place a system to punish wrong-doers and to safeguard all those honest persons who bring such misdeeds into the limelight. Society too must act to protect such persons. 

 Yours faithfully,

Mahesh Kapasi, New Delhi

 Sir ? It is unfortunate that as much as Rs 21,068 crore is being lost annually in bribes to politicians and officials. Corruption is one of the reasons for the increasing gap between the rich and the poor in India. Yet, the taking and giving of bribes continue, thanks to our politicians. Even in cases where corrupt officials have been caught red-handed, sanction to proceed with the cases has not been forthcoming. Voluntary disclosure schemes, like the one P. Chidambaram announded in 1997, merely protect the corrupt. The finance minister must try to check bribes by empowering the Lok Ayukta, vigilance commission and CBI to take criminal action and confiscate all ill-gotten money. These bodies must be put directly under the higher courts to get around the need for official ? sanction?. The judiciary also needs to speed up disbursal of corruption cases, especially against politicians 

 Yours faithfully,

 Parting shot

 Sir ? The prime minister visited Calcutta for a few hours on June 26 to attend a private function. But the city police erected heavy fences at hundreds of road junctions along the route, digging deep holes for the posts which damaged the recently laid interlock tiles on the footpath along Southern Avenue. Manmohan Singh returned the same day but no one bothered to fill the holes or replace the tiles. Hundreds of these gaping holes now pose a danger to pedestrians, especially senior citizen and children. One wonders what will happen to the remaining roads if VVIPs pay a few more visits to the city. What a way to damage whatever is left of the pride of the city and break a few unmindful ankles.

 Yours faithfully

Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

 LOV LA AND OTHER PUZZLES

 SHOT IN THE DARK

 What are the cryptic messages on women?s T-shirts supposed to mean? 

 It must be a new code. Its bearers are mostly young, hip and female and are being sighted all over. One day all the pieces will hopefully fall into place and make brilliant sense. 

 But as of now, there?s no clue. We are talking about the bits of literature that appear on girls? T-shirts, positioned mainly on their chests. Take this. This is a body-hugging mauve Tee worn by a trendy young thing with streaked hair that stands out like a tiger?s stripes. The lettering begins just below the round neckline and starts in a bold white type: ?European Extra. Nei Bar Endsi. So Happy?. This appears in three lines. Then the coda, in a smaller black font: ?Lov La?. We are in a ladies compartment in a crowded Mumbai local, where the smell of the fresh bangda that the intimidating Koli women are carrying in their wicker baskets is overwhelming, and the wearer of the Tee looks like she is going to college. 

 Next. A black Tee that sheathes the torso of a stunning teen. It simply says: ?MNP AKHA 100 Bravery?. In pink. She gets down at Churchgate. Is it any less intriguing? Then a light blue one. The message starts on the top left, in green. It says: ?MISS?. Below it, in numerals, and big, bold print, is written: ?60?. Why? 

 Similar in idea and design is another Tee walking down casually from Churchgate to Marine Drive. It says: ?BIT 63?. 

 Their presence is everywhere. Even in the station area in the Mumbai suburb of Kandivli, dominated by conservative Hindu Gujaratis, where the parents have obviously been hoodwinked. Otherwise why would a scrawny high-school-goer, carrying a bag heavy with books, be allowed to walk down the congested Akurli Road ? where there are as many auto-rickshaws as there are potholes ? in a T-short that says: ?OPEN ALL NIGHT?? 

 Not to mention another that hangs from a roadside stall in the same road. It simply says: ?SIZZLY?. 

 And as I write this, I, who am steadily sliding down middle age, find that I have been made part of the design too. There is a small tag sticking out from below my waist, left, from where the two sides are stitched together. It says: ?MISS SIDE CAR?. 

 I would like to have some answers. Are these fragments arriving from other worlds carrying the message that one day, one day, there will be a great convergence of all female life from all inhabited planets ? and women?s sexual liberation will finally take place? Or does it indicate an even greater freedom ? a brave new world free of Wren and Martin? 

 Or perhaps it is something closer home, linked to the same phenomenon that makes the shop on Akurli Road that sells only ?Made in China? goods that cost Rs 49, Rs 99, Rs 149 and Rs 199, to call itself ?My Shoppee?? The shop is also advertised on the local cable network with a rather lengthy jingle, in which the refrain is ?My Shoppee?. 

 I hope there?s some interesting answer, because I am tired with the effects of globalization ? tired with the G-word itself. And tired with some of the things that are happening to English, to Bengali, to Gujarati and I am sure to Mandarin, also, because of it.

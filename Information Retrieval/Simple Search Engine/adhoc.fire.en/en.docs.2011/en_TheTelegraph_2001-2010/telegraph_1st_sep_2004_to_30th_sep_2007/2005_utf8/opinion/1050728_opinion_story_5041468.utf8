 ONLY RESORT 

 Egypt is not unacquainted with terrorist attacks. So the three coordinated explosions at Sharm el-Sheikh, the tourist resort on the Red Sea coast, could not have been surprising, yet they were unexpected. Reportedly, there was even a warning. That led to an increase of security around the casinos, where the Israeli tourists often gather. But the terrorists attacked a hotel, a car park and a market. The attack on the Taba resorts last October had made Egypt aware that it was back on the terrorists? map after the lull since the attacks outside Luxor and Cairo a few years earlier. Sharm el-Sheikh has suffered badly, 88 dead being the first officially released figure. This time the dead are mostly Egyptians, although foreigners have been hit too. This was obviously not targeted at Israelis alone. Sharm el-Sheikh is one of the prized centres of Egypt?s tourism, as well as a place of political importance, being a spot where discussions about the Arab-Israeli peace process are held. Extremists do not hesitate to kill people of their own faith when the target is a government close to the United States of America, friendly with Israel and willing to recognize the government in Iraq.

 Not one but many terrorist groups have claimed responsibility for the killings. The abundance of claimants seems intended to confuse, as if each claim is invested with mockery and amorphous menace. The effect is doubled by the recent events in London, where the killing of an innocent man by the police exposed fully the ruthless cycle of bloodshed and destruction that terrorism activates. At least Egypt has drawn back from the edge of ill-feeling with another state by proclaiming that no Pakistanis were involved in the attack. But the attack has strengthened the hand of the Egyptian president, Mr Hosni Mubarak, in the forthcoming elections. Democracy is not a concern of the terrorists, nor are they worried about the complete illogic of their plans. Punishing a state for its closeness to the US by killing its citizens is likely to make the friendship even firmer. Firmness and farsightedness are the two things that the alliance against terror now needs most. Reciting the name of al Qaida after each episode is hardly useful. Rather, a realization that terror is the same all over the world, and its victims, of all colours and religions, are equally helpless in their suffering, might be more helpful in forming strategy.

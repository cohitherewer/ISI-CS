 GREAT THINGS

 The new framework for India?s defence ties with the United States of America, for the next ten years, is unarguably an important milestone in the bilateral relationship. It is critical now to ensure that the new understanding, which was approved by the Indian defence minister, Mr Pranab Mukherjee, and his American counterpart, Mr Donald Rumsfeld, in Washington, translates into reality. The new framework for the defence relationship provides for unprecedented opportunities in areas such as technology transfer, co-production, and research and development. It includes the possibilities of conducting joint military exercises and exchanges, collaborating in multinational operations, strengthening mutual capabilities to defeat terrorism, and expanding collaboration in missile defence. 

 When the president, Mr George W. Bush, met the prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, at Moscow in April, he promised the Indian leader ?great, great things? during his visit to Washington in July. Despite apprehensions within the left, there is strong support in India for engaging the only superpower in a strong, pragmatic partnership. Economic and technological ties, shared concern over China?s future, and the common battle against jihadi terrorism are key factors that bind the US and India together. Economically, the US is India?s largest trading partner, vital to its recognition as a global player. A modus vivendi with the US is not just desirable, but a necessity if India has to translate its aspirations into reality. Not surprisingly, therefore, India?s relations with the US have grown in virtually every field since the last five years, even while there continue to be differences on Pakistan, over India?s nuclear and missile programmes, on the speed and scale of liberalization, and over the US?s larger role in the international system. Despite many irritants, and not all are trivial, India?s relationship with the US in 2005 seems to be more secure than it has ever been in the last 50 years. There is greater connectivity at the levels of political leadership and senior officials, and the bandwidth has also expanded. The prime minister?s forthcoming visit should cement the bond even further.

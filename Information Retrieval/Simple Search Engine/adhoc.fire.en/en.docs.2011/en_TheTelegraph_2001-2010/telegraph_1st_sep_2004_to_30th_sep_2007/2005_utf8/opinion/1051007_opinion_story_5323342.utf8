 POISED ON THE CUTTING EDGE

 In the hands of innocents

 ARMS AND ARMOUR: TRADITIONAL WEAPONS OF INDIA By E. Jaiwant Paul, Roli, Rs 595

 Before the introduction of gunpowder technology in the early modern age, swords and shields constituted the principal offensive and defensive weapons in all the agrarian and bureaucratic states of Eurasia. Indian swords were reputed worldwide in the medieval era. India exported iron and wootz steel to Damascus which was the principal centre for the manufacture of sword blades. Even the Arabian Nights refers to the wonderful qualities of Indian swords.

 In this book, E. Jaiwant Paul, a high-ranking officer in the corporate sector who became a freelance historian, provides an account supported by numerous colour illustrations of the many types of swords and shields used in India till the onset of the modern age. The reader will not get any information about the history of the many kinds of swords used in various parts of the subcontinent at different times. Here, Paul?s first book, titled By My Sword and Shield, may be of some use to interested readers. Even so, Paul has no explanations for why the Hoysalas used forward-angled swords and the Turkish invaders from the 10th century onwards used long, slender curved blades ? the tulwars. 

 Paul records that from the late medieval age, Indian rulers had a partiality for decorating their weapons, favouring the techniques of damascening and enamelling. As a result, their weapons were less effective militarily. But he has no answer for why Indian rulers indulged in such frivolity in the 18th century, when armies had already switched to gunpowder.

 The nature of weapons used depended on the force structure of the enemy as also the terrain in which the campaign was mounted. The Hoysalas fought in the rocky forested Deccan plateau, which was definitely not cavalry country. The Pandya and the Chola armies, against whom the Hoysalas fought, depended mostly on elephants. The heavy S-shaped double-handed sword used by the Hoysala foot-soldiers was useful for cutting the trunks of elephants. In contrast, the Turkish invaders fought in the plains of Punjab and the Ganga-Jamuna delta. The Turks used steppe nomadic horses, thereby raising the ?speed of battle?. Slow moving foot-soldiers and elephants were useless against their fast paced manoeuvre warfare. The Rajput response was to deploy cavalry against the Turks. The long and slender tulwars used by the Turks were suitable for use on horseback.

 Paul is no academic historian, so he cannot be faulted for not referring to the debate about the comparative effectiveness of the Rajput sword, vis-?-vis the Islamic sword. It is still a matter of debate whether the Turks were technologically superior to the Rajputs. The military decline of the Hindu rulers in the 18th century was probably linked to the contemporary social and cultural matrix. Serious readers should consult Robert Elgood?s Hindu Arms and Armour: Arms and Armour from India, 1400-1865 which links the development of weapons with religious and cultural symbolism.

 After the pioneering work by G.N. Pant on traditional India?s weapons, the study of military hardware was in a limbo. Since professional historians have not concentrated on the history of military technology, Paul?s book fills the vacuum somewhat.

 Letters to Editor

 Friendly noises

 Sir ? There is no need to be euphoric about the Bush administration?s acceptance of the Indian position on terrorism and the Indian stand that any settlement of the Kashmir dispute must not include a change of international boundaries. In truth, cross-border terrorism has acquired its present dimensions because of the tacit approval it received from Washington, even a few years back. It took 9/11 for the Americans to realize that even they could fall prey to the ?jihad? that they had once actively supported in order to neutralize the Soviets in Afghanistan. Indian policy-makers and citizens need to be cautious about American designs instead of hailing the latest developments as ?ground-breaking?. No one can beat the Americans at making enemies out of friends. One needs only to look at Saddam Hussein.

 Yours faithfully,

Swayambhu Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? There was no need for a US-India joint statement on civilian nuclear cooperation. For India, se-parating its civilian and military nuclear facilities is not as important as is keeping its nuclear programme a secret from the world. Why does the US insist on inspecting India?s nuclear facilities? For India, transparency in military matters is not desirable in the national interest. The US?s gameplan is clear. It has Pakistan under its thumb, it now wants the same with India. But what it doesn?t realize is that India is not an irresponsible nuclear power. 

 Yours faithfully,

Mahesh Kumar, New Delhi

 Sir ? I was delighted to see the applause that greeted Manmohan Singh?s address to the US congress. His speech was indeed very effective, and full of substance. Singh has definitely helped the image of India with his statesmanship and oratory.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? I don?t understand why the media have described the prime minister?s speech in the US as a historic one. What he said, Indian foreign spokesmen have been saying all through the year.

 Yours faithfully,

Kumar Rahul, Raipur

 Sir ? While there is nothing objectionable in India and the US holding talks for mutual benefit, it would be below our dignity to rejoice at being recognized by the US (?Uncle Sam?s nod?, July 20). We have to take a measured approach so that we don?t sacrifice our time-tested friends at the altar of Indo-American relationship. We do have common economic interests, but to say that we share common values is an overstatement.

 Yours faithfully,

Md. Aslam Parvez, Calcutta

 Sir ? Manmohan Singh received a big applause in the US congress for his speech in which he proudly referred to India taking steps to reserve one-third of the around 3-million seats in civic bodies all over the country for women. But Singh here was not being entirely honest. The women?s reservation bill has been pending for a very long time and has no chance of being passed soon. And now compromise formulas like the Union home ministry?s suggestion to add 33 per cent seats in Parliament and state assemblies to accommodate women, are doing the rounds. But the government must not burden the people to satisfy the male parliamentarians opposed to the bill. Also, women will be reduced to just 25 per cent of the increased strength of Parliament and state assemblies. Till the bill is passed, it should be compulsory for all recognized political parties to give at least one-third party-tickets to women. Even Pakistan has provided reservation for women in legislatures. 

 Yours faithfully,

Subhash C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 In the woods 

 Sir ? There is a lot of misconception about the draft scheduled tribes (recognition of forest rights) bill, 2005. Malvika Singh?s ?Of tigers and trees? (July 19), which compares the bill with the Waqf board claiming rights over the Taj Mahal only adds to this confusion. Singh?s limited exposure to rural and tribal India might lead her to find the idea of people protecting the forests laughable. There is ample evidence to believe that the forests would be safer if the communities dwelling there are roped in to protect them. The concept of bringing forests under the purview of the state emerged from the need to commercially exploit them. The forest department was an outcome of this need. Under its watch, 60 per cent of the forests have been lost. Between 1951-1981, the authorities have diverted 4.238 million hectares of forest land for non-forest use (dams, mines, industries). Only one-third of this amount is estimated to be needed to settle the land rights of forest dwellers ? land that is already in use for agriculture. According to the 1990 forest-land settlement guideline of the government of India, a large amount of this land falls under the FP 2 category, that is, land where there has been faulty settlement of rights at the time of declaring the area forest land. For example, 40 per cent of Orissa?s forests are ?deemed? reserved, that is, settlement of rights has not taken place so far. 

 The bill seeks the following rights for the tribals and forest dwellers: right to agriculture, right to minor forest produce, firewood and medicinal herbs, fishing in water bodies inside the forest, and grazing rights. The community cannot sell, transfer or buy the land that it possesses, it can only be inherited. The bill does not talk about taking away any of the protection enjoyed by Indian forests so far, only about involving the community in the task. If we fail to do so, we are in for several more Sariskas.

 Yours faithfully,

Nayana Chowdhury, Durgapur

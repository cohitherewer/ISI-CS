 TO AVERT THE NEXT DISASTER

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the government of India?s status report on Disaster Management in India, August 2004

 With the mitigation and preparedness measures outlined in this and earlier section in position, it is expected that natural hazards could be handled more efficiently to ensure that these did not get converted into disasters. Disaster Management requires multi-disciplinary and pro-active approach...The message being put across is that, in order to move towards safer and sustainable national development, development projects should be sensitive towards disaster mitigation.

 Our mission is vulnerability reduction to all types of hazards, be it natural or man-made. This is not an easy task to achieve, keeping in view the vast population, and the multiple natural hazards to which this country is exposed. However, if we are firm in our conviction and resolve that the government and the people of this country are not prepared to pay the price in terms of massive casualties and economic losses, the task, though difficult, is achievable and we shall achieve it.

 We have taken the first few but significant steps towards vulnerability reduction, putting in place prevention and mitigation measures and preparedness for a rapid and professional response. With a massive awareness generation campaign and building up of capabilities as well as institutionalization of the entire mechanism through a techno-legal and techno-financial framework, we are gradually moving in the direction of sustainable development. 

 The various prevention, mitigation measures are aimed at building up the capabilities of the communities, voluntary organizations and government functionaries at all levels. Particular stress is being laid on ensuring that these measures are institutionalized. This is a major task being undertaken by the Government to put in place mitigation measures for vulnerability reduction.

 ...This is just a beginning. The ultimate goal is to make prevention and mitigation a part of normal day-to-day life. We have a firm conviction that with these measures in place, we could say with confidence that disasters like the Orissa cyclone and Bhuj earthquake will not be allowed to recur in this country; at least not at the cost, which the country has paid in these two disasters in terms of human lives, livestock, loss of property and means of livelihood.

 Our vision 2020 is to build a safer and secure India through sustained collective effort, synergy of national capacities and people?s participation... The path ahead, which looks difficult today, will become a lot easier as we move along together.

 ?Disaster Management: The Development Perspective

 1. Five-year plan documents have, historically, not included...issues relating to the management and mitigation of natural disasters. The traditional perception has been limited to the idea of ?calamity relief?, which is seen essentially as a non-plan item of expenditure. However, the impact of major disasters cannot be mitigated by the provision of immediate relief alone, which is the primary focus of calamity relief efforts. Disasters can have devastating effects on the economy; they cause huge human and economic losses, and can significantly set back development efforts of a region or a state. Two recent disasters, the Orissa cyclone and the Gujarat earthquake, are cases in point. With the kind of economic losses and developmental setbacks that the country has been suffering year after year, the development process needs to be sensitive towards disaster prevention and mitigation aspects... 

 2. Further, although disaster management is not generally associated with plan financing, there are in fact a number of plan schemes in operation, such as for drought proofing, afforestation, drinking water, etc., which deal with the prevention and mitigation of the impact of natural disasters. External assistance for post-disaster reconstruction and streamlining of management structures also is a part of the plan. A specific, centrally sponsored scheme on disaster management also exists. The plan thus already has a defined role in dealing with the subject.

 3. Recently, expert bodies have dwelt on the role of the Planning Commission and the use of plan funds in the context of disaster management. Suggestions have been made in this regard by the Eleventh Finance Commission, and also the high powered committee on disaster management. An approach on planning for safe development needs to be set out.

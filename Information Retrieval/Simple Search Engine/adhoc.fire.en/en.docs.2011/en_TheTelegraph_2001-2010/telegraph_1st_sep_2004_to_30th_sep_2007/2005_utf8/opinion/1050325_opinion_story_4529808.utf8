 Straight from the heart

 NEHRUS LETTERS TO HIS SISTER 

 BEFORE FREEDOM (1909-1947) 

 Edited and compiled by Nayantara Sahgal, 

 Roli, Rs 495

 ?Letters are often more revealing 

 than studied writing. They are spontaneous, without much 

 of an arri?re pens?e?, wrote Jawaharlal Nehru to 

 his sister, Vijayalakshmi Pandit, from the Ahmednagar Fort 

 Camp on June 29, 1943. In the same letter, he observes that 

 in personal writing, ?every one of us, consciously or unconsciously, 

 puts on a pose and, as in life itself, we try to appear 

 not as we are but as we would like to be or at least as 

 we imagine we are.? 

 This is a collection of the letters Nehru wrote during his European tours and also from prison to his ?darling Nan?. A wealth of sibling love suffuses these letters. Nehru come through in them as an out-and-out family man ? a worried husband, a concerned father, a devoted son, and, of course, an extraordinarily affectionate brother. Writing these letters was presumably Nehru?s way of reconstructing a domestic life from which he had been swept away by his political career. Surely, this is one instance of ?striking a pose? with ?spontaneity?? 

 At another level, these letters represent one of the many ways Nehru ?discovered? his India, Touring through Europe offered him opportunities to develop an understanding of Indian culture and way of life by way of comparisons. This resulted, sometimes, in despair at what he thought were typical Indian frailties or hypocrisies. 

 While writing from prison in the Forties, Nehru appears calmer, more reflective and sombre. Here is what he wrote to his sister from Ahmednagar on November 9, 1943, ?We are all, individuals as well as nations, products of our past (call it heredity or cumulative effect of actions) and of our environments. ? 

 This perception of the past serves as a prelude to The Discovery of India published in 1946. But, more important, this too is a gesture ? a ?pose? ? to ?imagine? what we are, with ?spontaneity?. Nehru, a ?product? of his times, assimilated this contradiction in his persona and when he spoke out, antinomies magically dissolved.

 The letters in this volume, which also has some wonderful photographs, showcase the lost art of letter writing and also ?Gandhi?s India?. But more than anything else, they reveal an astute mind for whom letter-writing was a means to read lives ? of people and of nations. It was one of the ways Nehru undertook his own ?tryst with destiny?.

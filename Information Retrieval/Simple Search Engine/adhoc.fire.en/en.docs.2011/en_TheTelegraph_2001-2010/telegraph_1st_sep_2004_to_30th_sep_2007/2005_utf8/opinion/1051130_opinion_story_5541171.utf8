 TO LIVE IN THE GRIP OF RED TERROR

 The lack of a coherent response from the government has made the Maoist threat in Bihar more menacing, writes Uttam Sengupta

 A force to reckon with

 Maoists continue to mock the Indian state. After demonstrating the ease with which they can break into jails and loot armouries at Jehanabad and Giridih, they seem to have gone on a recruitment spree. Pamphlets have reportedly been distributed in the Bihar and Jharkhand countryside, possibly elsewhere as well, inviting young people to join the ?revolution?. What is interesting is the promise they have made to pay a monthly stipend, which reportedly is Rs 2,000 per head, and also a compensation, worth Rs 2 lakh, in case of ?death in action?. That they are flush with funds is also borne out by the fact that several doctors in Patna admitted last week that they can identify the Maoists by their willingness to pay for expensive tests and medicine. 

 In large parts of Bihar and Jharkhand, 

 the Maoists no longer allow government agencies to function. 

 Contractors cannot lay roads or canals unless they pay up 

 and work under Maoist supervision. Nobody dare go to the 

 police. A senior police officer claimed that every time 

 a Maoist leader is arrested, local policemen invariably 

 ask for forgiveness after claiming that the ?operation? 

 was prompted and guided by ?New Delhi? and added that even 

 the judiciary is no longer immune to the Maoist threat. 

 A villager in Jehanabad summed 

 up the situation rather well. Government agencies first 

 started acting like the mafia in Bihar by arresting, harassing 

 and convicting the innocent for their vested interests. 

 They have now been replaced by the Maoists, he added. People 

 are left with no other choice but to live under a reign 

 of terror let loose by both sides.

 The response from the establishment has been confused, and is unlikely to have instilled much confidence. After the jailbreak in Jehanabad, the Union home ministry first shrugged its shoulders and claimed that law and order was a state subject though Bihar had been under president?s rule for over six months. It soon realized the absurdity of its stand and offered to send commandos after the Maoists. The commandos did land in Bihar and scouted the countryside for several days, hounds in tow, before the government sheepishly withdrew them. 

 The state government blamed the Election Commission for diverting a large number of policemen to election duty and claimed that it was the valour of the handful of cops present that prevented Maoists from looting the armoury at the Police Lines. The same day, the Union home ministry was heard quoting the state?s director-general of police, who said that a sufficient number of policemen were stationed at Jehanabad. Amidst all this confusion, the Maoists made it clear that they had no intention of looting the armoury and that it was a holding operation at the Police Lines and elsewhere to ensure that the jailbreak was accomplished without interference from the police.

 The Jehanabad administration stood virtually paralysed on that day. Although technology made it possible for even national television channels to start flashing the news of the Maoist strike barely an hour after the incident, security agencies failed to cut off the escape routes of Maoist rebels. Indeed, the first contingent of the paramilitary forces, or the special task force, remained immobile at the Jehanabad Zero Mile even three hours after the Maoists escaped, allowing a car carrying newsmen to move into town. So scared were the security forces of landmines that they eventually arrived at the jail half-an-hour after the newsmen. A solitary civilian official, possibly the sub-divisional officer, and his pistol- bearing bodyguard, both in a state of shock, were the only ones in the jail where a few inmates remained huddled in the darkness. The administration had the rest of the night to put its act together but till noon next day, it was a free-for-all inside the jail with prisoners, ordinary people and the newsmen moving freely in and out of the premises. It is not the jailbreak the administration should be ashamed of. It is their conduct after the jailbreak that was shameful and caused concern.

 Jehanabad, disconcertingly, was not the first such display of Maoist power. In February last year, Maoists had carried out a similar operation at Koraput in Orissa, where hundreds of armed insurgents attacked the police station, treasury, banks, jail and the collectorate and then retreated. This year, in June, the Maoists once again attacked several targets simultaneously at Madhuban on the Bihar-Nepal border. 

 In November itself, barely a few days before Jehanabad, they struck at Giridih and looted the armoury at the homeguards training school. At all these places, they are said to have conducted operations with clockwork precision, used sophisticated communication equipment like walkie-talkies, cell phones and the wireless, vehicles and, of course, awesome firepower that included the use of assault rifles. 

 What is more worrying is that Maoists seem to have infiltrated the police and the government and built up a communication system that the latter are unable to crack. Even when telephones are tapped and information received that a senior Maoist leader would arrive on a particular day at a particular station, police are never sure if he would travel on the same day or a week thereafter; or whether the leader would get down four stations after the specified point or before. The codes get increasingly sophisticated and complicated and is continually changed to throw the police off-track. Policemen following Maoists are also frustrated by the almost complete lack of cooperation from people in the countryside. A majority of them live in the fear of Maoists or are secretly pleased that the brutal police force have finally met their match. 

 The Maoists, say the sleuths, have learnt to use ?external? hard discs on their computer so that even the occasional recovery of computers used by Maoists provide them no information at all. Chance recovery of cell phones too reveal little because the names and addresses are usually fake and the mobile sets are discarded at regular intervals at both ends. The wireless and the walkie-talkies are used for a short period of time and only during ?operations?. The rest of the time, these devices remain ?dead?, thus frustrating efforts to track the frequencies used. Mobility, familiarity with the terrain and flexibility are the advantages that the Maoists seem to enjoy. They can walk through the difficult terrain at night while policemen wait for vehicles and the daybreak. The Maoists seem to be learning new techniques and adapting to new situations all the time while policemen sit chewing their nails.

 The situation has got more complicated by the fact that many people within the government are sympathetic towards the Maoist struggle against oppression. A large number of professionals and intellectuals are convinced that the rebels are idealists fired by revolutionary zeal and that they have sacrificed a more secure life for a better tomorrow. There are also the hardliners who compare the Maoists with the mafia and advocate a heavy-handed approach towards them. It is this confusion that the Maoists have taken full advantage of to pose a serious challenge to the government. But the state continues to underplay the threat and appears clueless. Unless it works out a coherent response, incidents like Jehanabad will get repeated elsewhere.

 Letters to Editor

 Truth of the matter

 Sir ? The ruckus that the sangh parivar is creating over L.K. Advani?s statement in Pakistan is unwarranted. The contents of Advani?s public statements are the stuff of historical records. Jinnah did envisage a secular Pakistan, which his religious-extremist successors thwarted. Jinnah was a votary of Hindu-Muslim unity till about 1935 when his ambition to be a national leader was frustrated. It is true that Direct Action Day was called by Jinnah, which culminated in the Calcutta killings of August 1946. The British administration was equally responsible for this, as it had created a Frankenstein in Jinnah. But surely Advani cannot be expected to air these facts on his ?goodwill? mission. The parivar should be proud of the reception their leader has received in Pakistan despite the perception of him as a hardliner.

 Yours faithfully, 

 V. Srinivas, Nagpur

 Fast forward 

 Sir ? The landmark judgment of the fast-track court in Jodhpur, convicting two men of rape after a 16-day-long trial, should set the trend for all courts dealing with such matters (?Superfast sentence in rape case?, June 2). A large portion of the credit goes to the Rajasthan high court too, since it was its suo motu cognizance of the case that ensured the trial was wrapped up in a month. The police too has done a good job in solving the case fast, especially since the rape of the German tourist was such a delicate matter. Though this landmark verdict has upheld the integrity of our judiciary, we must be careful that there are no inordinate delays in the future. Lastly, let us hope that this judgment is not a flash in the pan and that it will be not be struck down in the upper courts, as has happened with many of the judgments of fast-track courts in recent times. 

 Yours faithfully,

Subhasish Mohanty, Cuttack

 Sir ? Rajasthan attracts large numbers of foreign tourists every year. Thus the rape of the Lufthansa Airlines employee in Jodhpur by two auto-rickshaw drivers has put a question-mark on the security of such tourists in India. It is good that the case has been solved so fast, unlike many rape cases. And that the accused have been given a life sentence, unlike so many cases where the rapists have been freed because the trials have dragged on, forcing the judge to give the accused the benefit of doubt owing to lack of evidence.

 Yours faithfully,

Kaushik Guha, Calcutta

 Sir ? The verdict was necessary to salvage the reputation of our nation and for Rajasthan to live up to its invitation, ?Padharo mahro desh?.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur 

 Sir ? The Jodhpur fast-track court?s ideal should be followed not only for all rape-cases but for all other crimes as well. Speedy punishment will be instrumental in bringing down crime as well.

 Also, life-imprisonment should mean a stay in prison until death, instead of just 14 years, as at present. The media must also be forbidden from publishing the photographs or names of the lawyers of rapists in such high-profile cases, since many of them take on these cases only for the free publicity. India should follow the Islamic countries in having a dress-code for females. 

 Yours faithfully,

Subhash C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir ? As an English tourist visiting India, I have been following articles about the recent rapes of some ?Mumbai bar girls?. Virtually every article described them at least once as a ?bar girl?. Does this have any bearing on the fact that a poor woman was raped? India is a completely different culture and I may be seeing things from an English perspective. But what I cannot see is how a woman?s profession or what clothes she chooses to wear can be an excuse for the abhorent behaviour of men. How would the purists feel if it was their daughter who was raped? Would they blame the girl for wearing ?low-waist jeans and mini skirts??

 Yours faithfully,

Mark Walshe, North Cheam, UK

 Sir ? From now on, all rape victims should take their case to these fast-track courts. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Asif Khan, Gaya

 Sir ? The judgment by the Jodhpur court has borne out the faith of Indians in the judiciary. But such judgments shouldn?t be rare, for justice delayed is justice denied.

 Yours faithfully,

Amarendra Sahoo, Dhenkanal

 Sir ? The Jodhpur fast-track court may have been very prompt, but it?s taken two years for the courts to announce the death sentence for the rapist of a child (?Death for child rape?, June 4). The government should give top priority to propagating and instilling moral values essential in day-to-day social conduct through the education system. 

 Yours faithfully,

Salil Gewali, Shillong

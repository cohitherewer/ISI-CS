 DANGER SIGNALS

 The violence in Bangladesh raises serious questions about the future of freedom in that country. Unprecedented though it was, spread across 63 of the 64 districts, it is not just the scale of the violence that is the most worrying aspect of it. Its impact on the government of Ms Khaleda Zia is also of minor consequence. What is far more disturbing is the threat that the perpetrators of the violence pose to civilized values in Bangladesh. The ominous signals came from the choice of their targets. Institutions that represent civil liberties and democratic values ? such as government offices, courts, universities and press clubs ? were the prime targets. The message was that Islamic law must be founded in Bangladesh on the ruins of all secular and democratic institutions. And terror must be the key to the setting up of the new dispensation. 

 The Zia regime must take the blame for the country?s dangerous drift. Many countries and civil liberties organizations had warned Dhaka of the danger of Islamic fundamentalism in Bangladesh. Murderous attacks on secular politicians, journalists, writers and women activists of non-government organizations had become routine and were aimed at destroying all challenges to Islamic regimentation. Yet, the government seemed to have ignored the threats; worse, elements within the establishment were suspected to have connived at sectarian violence and threats for narrow political gains. The presence of two Islamic parties in Ms Zia?s coalition government may have influenced her strategy on the fundamentalist groups. Even when the government banned some of them under international pressure, the step was seen as both insincere and inadequate. 

 The disturbing developments in Bangladesh cannot but add to New Delhi?s worries. With a porous border between the countries running to some 4,000 kilometres, religious fanatics in Bangladesh can threaten India?s security. The influx of illegal migrants from Bangladesh into India has long been a major irritant in bilateral relations between the two neighbours. Dhaka?s refusal to accept the fact is justifiably seen in New Delhi as an act of connivance. The other issue of the Northeastern militants using Bangladeshi territory for arms training and shelters has caused even greater tensions. Wednesday?s bomb blasts would not help matters between the two countries. After a long spell of stand-offs, New Delhi had decided to break the ice. The recent visit of the external affairs minister, Mr K. Natwar Singh, to Dhaka signalled the change. And the new engagement is to culminate in Mr Manmohan Singh?s visit to Dhaka for the summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation in November. But Dhaka must clean up its act in order to earn India?s ? and the world?s ? trust.

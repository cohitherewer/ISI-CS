 CREEPING BACKWARD

 The progress in India?s agriculture has not been commensurate with the country?s economic needs, writes R. Gopalakrishnan

 Drying up

 Agriculture has to be the key contributor if India is to raise its gross domestic product growth by two more percentage points. Higher agricultural growth alone can enhance the rural purchasing power, which, in turn, is essential to expand the consumption markets for soaps, cell- phones, two wheelers, and so on.

 In my view, agriculture and rural India are heading towards a crisis. If true, this will mean a crisis for the entire nation. During the tenth plan, agricultural growth has fallen far short of the target. The trouble is that long-standing crises cease to be seen as a problem and the ?creeping normalcy? syndrome sets in. This is dangerous for two reasons. First, because poverty has a close link with agriculture; and second, because there is growing impatience among people over administrators not implementing known solutions.

 The escape from poverty cannot happen without progress in agriculture. Three hundred years ago, all nations were poor. Lester Thurow commented in Fortune Favors the Bold that in 1700, the average American earned just five times what the average Indian earned. Today, it is about seventy times. In all countries in those days, most of the people were employed on the farms and they all followed roughly similar farming techniques. The major differentiators were soil and climate. That was why their per capita incomes were not hugely apart.

 Technological innovations occurred during the 19th century; some nations seized them while some others did not. This widened the productivity gap among countries, thus widening their income disparities. 

 Three points are noteworthy here ? all regions were poor until 1700; all regions experienced economic progress after that; some regions progressed more because they improved productivity through technology. India was left behind during this period. As the world moves on, the search for a solution to our problem acquires greater urgency.

 In their book Predictable Surprises, Max Bazerman and Michael Watkins list the six symptoms of a brewing crisis. All are visible with respect to our agricultural sector. One, leaders know that a problem exists and that the problem will not solve itself. Two, they recognize that the problem is getting worse over a period of time. Three, fixing the problem will cost a lot today and the benefits may come only much later. Four, this cost will probably be borne by one leader but the benefit, which follows much later, will accrue to some other leader. Five, leaders have the natural human tendency to maintain the status quo by fixing a few short-term things. Six, a small minority benefits from such inaction and subverts the efforts of the leadership for their own benefit.

 The solution lies in releasing the entrepreneurial spirit of rural India. In 1991, when the country faced a crisis, there was an unleashing of the pent-up energy of a frustrated and repressed industry. Indian agricultural production and marketing face a similar crisis and require to be unshackled and unleashed. Policies should focus single-mindedly on releasing the inherent entrepreneurship of the Indian farmer. We know that a latent rural entrepreneurship exists. There are several success stories ? Nashik and its grapes, Anand?s revolution with milk, Guntur?s chillies, West Bengal and its success story with potatoes, and Baramati?s with sugar.

 The three key factors behind the release of rural entrepreneurship are rural infrastructure, electricity and subsidies. 

 Rural infrastructure is a good barometer of development in the rural sector. The gross capital formation in agriculture as percentage of GDP has fallen from 4 per cent in 1979-80 to 2.1 per cent in 1990-91 to 1.4 per cent in 2003-04. Further, the share of the public sector has declined more sharply than the private sector. If the state shies away from investing in rural infrastructure, it can only indicate that something is terribly wrong somewhere. With two-thirds of the Indian population residing in rural areas, the perils of ignoring this are huge.

 Electricity is a crying shame everywhere in India. Indians use just 545 kilowatts of electricity per head per year, compared to 1,672 units in China. Peak demand exceeded supply by 11.3 per cent in 1998 and by 12.1 per cent in the last financial year. Further, rural India, comprising two-thirds of our population, accounts for only 13 per cent of electricity consumption. 

 The shortfall of electricity supply has two manifestations: first, a shortage of electricity in areas where electrification has happened, manifested in load-shedding and power cuts. Second, inadequate penetration of electricity. One-fifth of our villages are yet to be electrified. Even within the four-fifth villages electrified, over half the households have no electricity connection.

 It is assumed that rural consumers prefer to receive free power. That is true only to the extent that everybody would like to get something free. However, if the electricity is not available at all, what is the relevance of its being free? A survey was conducted by Confederation of Indian Industry titled ?Consumer Attitude Study on Electricity Supply?, covering 15 states with a large sample size. Customers across all segments gave higher importance to access and availability of electricity, more so than the price of power.

 The final point relates to subsidies. Subsidies are a great paradox in all countries and a complex subject. India is not unique in having agricultural subsidies; many countries have more subsidy than India. However, subsidies should be paid directly to marginal farmers, otherwise they reach the wrong target. India has not been able to do this.

 Particularly with respect to fertilizers, at a time when this industry should be attracting investment, the uncertainty of the subsidy regime is proving to be a dampener. The best example of this is the so-called decontrol of phosphatic and potassic fertilizers on the recommendation of the joint parliamentary committee in 1992. 

 The de facto control in the garb of ?recommended price? still continues and the industry has been suffering because of the government?s intention to reduce subsidy leading to arbitrary decisions. The SSP industry, despite its agronomic value supplying sulphur (an important secondary nutrient), is virtually facing extinction. Urea fertilizer subsidy policy is also under review and there are apprehensions that the desire to control subsidy will dictate the policy as before. It would be much better if the fertilizer industry is also allowed to breathe freely. Some people feel that the fertilizer industry pockets the subsidy. But one should ask instead why the fertilizer industry, a supposed beneficiary, would lobby for freedom from controls and subsidy.

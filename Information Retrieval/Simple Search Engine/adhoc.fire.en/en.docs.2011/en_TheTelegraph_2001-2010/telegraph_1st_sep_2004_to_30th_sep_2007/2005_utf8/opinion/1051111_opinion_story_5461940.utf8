 ALL?S FAIR

 When people begin to slip on their own excuses, they expose their anxiety. So it is revealing that Indian members of parliament, whichever be the government in Delhi, have repeatedly and concertedly ducked out of the way of passing two bills in recent times ? the reservations for women in legislative bodies bill and the lok pal bill. It is rather funny that most are publicly vocal about the virtues of the two bills and about the value they would add to the democracy. Only, they are never passed. And it is years since they were proposed. The lok pal bill is about accountability of public servants, whether elected or appointed, and accessibility ? any citizen can complain about a high official to the lok pal. But MPs who were never comfortable with the idea of the lok pal need not worry any more. If the bill was shelved during the National Democratic Alliance regime because of hesitation over bringing the prime minister?s position under its purview, its fate during the United Progressive Alliance regime is unlikely to be much happier. It is no longer just the question of the prime minister or president?s positions being included in the lok pal bill. The national judicial commission bill, which would refer complaints against the higher judiciary, including the chief justice of India, to the lok pal, is being vigorously criticized by the chief justice himself.

 The issues that have been raised against this pair of bills include the question of trust reposed in the highest constitutional positions, those of the prime minister, president and the chief justice of India. But the democratic principle abjures the blind trust and dependence of feudalism; it demands accountability in return for trust. The respect for a chair must be matched with the awareness of the incumbent?s fitness for the chair. The politician is compelled, by the electoral system, to at least appear accountable ? although reality is sadly deficient in this aspect. It is not expected that the judiciary should be accountable in that way. At the same time, the institution that upholds and administers the law must not be seen to consider its members above it. Without transparency there can be neither trust on the one side nor dignity on the other.

 Letters to Editor

 One final tax for the FM

 Sir ? It was wonderful of the Union finance minister, P. Chidambaram, to go to the income tax office in Chennai and file his tax returns (?FM leads from front in date with taxman?, Nov 1). But wouldn?t he have set a better example if he filed his returns way ahead of the last day? His visit to the IT office meant that ordinary citizens, who wanted to finish filing their returns fast, had to queue for longer hours given the heavy security arrangements. Whoever is impressed by the FM?s act, those in the queue at the Chennai IT office on October 31 were certainly not.

 Yours faithfully,

 Suman Barthakur,Guwahati

 The absconding act

 Sir ? By the act of dodging arrest for 16 long years, the former Communist Party of India (Marxist) minister, Narayan Biswas, has lived up to Shakespeare?s words ? ?the law is more honoured in its breach than its observance?. There is no doubt that the CPI(M) harboured this fugitive, fielded him in the assembly elections and made him minister with the full knowledge of the pending arrest warrant against him.

 Immediately following the surrender drama involving Biswas, instructions were sent out from Alimuddin Street to get a host of CPI(M) activists to surrender, and obtain bail for them within one month. It proves again that the party wields total control over the state police. But what can one expect from a party whose senior leader once asked his comrades to catch hold of an election official by the collar? The CPI(M) could soon beat Laloo Yadav?s Rashtriya Janata Dal in flaunting MLAs with criminal backgrounds.

 Yours faithfully,

R. Sambamurthy, Calcutta

 Sir ? After facing criticism from the media and the opposition, Narayan Biswas has finally had to resign (?Minister on run resigns, CM smiles?, Nov 1). Although sections of the opposition claim this to be their moral victory, the stepping down of Biswas was long due. Biswas had been thoroughly discredited. He had made the ruling party vulnerable to further expos?s. So he had to go; if the government had to put up a clean image of the party before the people. The CPI(M) knows that no chances can be taken before the assembly polls. The chief minister, too, was put under pressure by Biswas, who had begun to display a devil-may-care attitude in front of the media. Even he has had to come round to saying that as an ordinary worker of the party, he would do what the party asks him to. His resignation, though inevitable, is welcome, for any minister facing criminal charges ought to resign.

 However, the sudden rush to arrest everyone who has ever been charged with criminal activity is merely a tactic to divert attention.

 Yours faithfully,

Koyel Basu, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is surprising that the police of West Bengal declared Narayan Biswas as an ?absconding wanted criminal? and did not produce him in court for the last 17 years. During this time, Biswas had been attending assembly, attending public meetings (with police escort), and yet, in police records, he was absconding. While proceedings begin against Biswas, a parallel case must be opened against the police for wilfully misleading the honourable court and obstructing Biswas?s trial. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arindam Ganguly, Uttarpara

 Sir ? The ruling party of West Bengal (including the chief minister), the state?s bureaucratic and police establishments are all complicit in perverting the course of justice. After the Narayan Biswas episode, any upright citizen can bring a public interest litigation against the government of West Bengal and its various administrative organs. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sunil Kumar Pal, London

 IN FIELDS OF FORBIDDEN FRUITS

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the World Drug Report 2005, published by the United Nations Office of Drug and Crime

 The quantities of drugs seized increased substantially in 2003. Expressed in terms of weight, quantities increased between 2002 and 2003 in all the major drug categories: depressants (up 51 per cent), opium (up 38 per cent), heroin/morphine (up 32 per cent), cocaine (up 33 per cent), cannabis (up 24 per cent), and amphetamine type stimulants (up 18 per cent). 

 While the quantities of drugs seized has increased, year on year, last year?s increases were higher than average in all categories, except ATS, which was about the same. The reasons for this surge are still unclear. By weight, cannabis tends to top the rankings of quantities seized, and 2003 was no exception, with cocaine, opium, heroin/morphine, and ATS following. 

 A more meaningful comparison can be made by reducing total volumes to dose-units. In 2003, global drug seizures increased by 10 per cent and more than doubled between 1985 and 2003, from 14.3 billion to 31.3 billion doses. Cannabis still remains the top drug seized, with 70 per cent of all drug doses seized being cannabis, followed by cocaine (16 per cent), opiates (9 per cent) and ATS (3 per cent).

 Thus, in terms of the quantities involved, trends for most substances tend to be upward in recent years, and this increase is not confined to any geographic region. Europe shows the strongest growth rate of seizures (13 per cent per annum), followed by Oceania (9 per cent per annum). The largest seizures, however, continue to be made in the Americas (40 per cent of the world?s seizures by weight in 2003, down from 58 per cent in 1985), followed by Europe (30 per cent in 2003, up from 7 per cent in 1985)), Asia (16 per cent), Africa (13 per cent), and Oceania (0.4 per cent).

 The global production trend is rather stable for opium, and declining for coca but seems to be increasing for cannabis and, following some declines, for ATS . UNODC, in collaboration with selected governments, uses a sophisticated monitoring system based on the use of modern satellite technology with on the ground verification and yield surveys. This method produces some of the most rigorous data on the drug problem, because the measurement is direct and quantifiable. Production data for opium and coca leaf are thus probably the most reliable indicators of how the drug problem is evolving at the global level. 

 Information on the final output ? heroin or cocaine ? is more difficult to obtain and subject to a higher degree of uncertainty as direct access to the operators of clandestine laboratories is difficult. Existing transformation ratios are usually based on rather small samples of case studies in which operators demonstrated the cocaine/heroin transformation processes to law enforcement bodies.

 How representative the results of these case studies are for the clandestine manufacturing process as a whole is unknown but they are the best estimates currently available. While production is clearly linked to trafficking and consumption, sometimes the links are less direct than they appear.

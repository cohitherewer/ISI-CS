 ACTING WITH A DIFFERENCE

 INDIA CONNECTION

The controversy over Iraq may reduce even Keith Vaz?s majority, even though he is recognised as a conscientious MP who knows his constituents personally. He holds Leicester East with a huge majority of 13,442 in a constituency with an electorate of 67,000. 

 This time, the MP of Indian origin fears he might lose one in three of his 6,000 Muslim voters. Fortunately, the Bollywood actor, Dalip Tahil, has stepped in to campaign for him. 

 Tahil caused women with babies to rush out of their homes, crowds with mobile telephone cameras to gather on pavements. He visited video stores and discussed the relative merits of his hits and brought traffic to a stop in Belgrave Road and Green Lane, two heavily Asian areas of the city. Asians make up 49 per cent of voters. 

 Tahil heaped high praise on Britain for creating almost a model society in which even those who had come as refugees had flourished. 

 ?It speaks very well for Britain,? he said. ?If you make Britain your home, if your children grow up here, then Britain should be your priority.? 

 The owner of Shahnawaz Video pulled out copies of Tahil?s movies, notably Baazigar and Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak. The man said they were great movies. Who was Tahil to disagree? 

 In his battle van, festooned with posters, Vaz could scarcely believe his luck. 

 ?Mohinder,? he shouted to an elderly Sikh across the road, ?Come and see who I have in my car. I have Dalip Tahil with me.? 

 As Mohinder?s face registered first shock and then delight, Tahil mouthed a bit of Bollywood dialogue before delivering his message: ?Keith Vaz ko vote deejeye panch May ko.? 

 After a Leicester-Derby football match, Tahil got a taste of loutish English behaviour. Provoked by Vaz?s van, an English fan came up to the MP, pulled down his trousers and pressed his naked bottom against the vehicle. 

 This was the youth?s gesture of contempt against Vaz and possibly the whole democratic process. Tony Blair?s policy of ?education, education, education? has clearly failed, at least, in this case.

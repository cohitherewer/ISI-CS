 Letters to Editor

 Time to retire

 Sir ? ?Pained Basu asks why? (June 20) talks of Jyoti Basu?s hurt at seeing his men mercilessly thrashed up by the state police. I fail to understand why nonagenarian Basu should continue to meddle in the working of the government despite the fact that he had retired on health grounds. Moreover, when he was chief minister for nearly a quarter of a century, nobody meddled in his way of running the government. And he could turn his era into one of widespread industrial stagnation, gheraos and bandhs minus any interference from anyone. It is the dynamism of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee that has somewhat changed the situation. Investors, who turned apprehensive of their fate during Basu?s tenure, are returning to the state. I strongly feel that Bhattacharjee should be given a free hand to bring prosperity to West Bengal and that Basu should retire gracefully.

 Yours faithfully, 

 A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 In all fairness

 Sir ? The fact that the president, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, had to reprimand state governors recently in the strongest terms possible only reflects the state of Indian politics (?Shinde strains at Raj Bhavan leash?, June 16). It is unfortunate that the constitutional post of the governor has been politicized to such an extent that the president had to ask his appointees to behave in a manner that befits their position. The governors were asked to act in an unbiased manner so that democracy does not become a farce. 

 It is painful to see governors, who are otherwise highly respected people drawn from different fields, be it academics or politics or art, trying to prove their loyalty to various party high commands. Some present governors, it may be noted, were chief ministers of some states a few months back. The recent developments in Goa and Jharkhand are ample proof of how governors actively try to stall the formation of governments by rival camps. 

 In a more recent incident, even before the Bharatiya Janata Party-Janata Dal(U) could stake their claim in Bihar, the governor, Buta Singh, had dissolved the assembly, forcing re-elections in the poverty-stricken state. If the governor is going to discharge his responsibilities at the prodding of the party at the Centre, then what is the need to have a separate government in each state? Let us hope that the words of the president have been clearly understood and are honestly followed in the future.

 Yours faithfully,

Anurag Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? At the governors? meet recently, the prime minister reiterated what the president had emphasized before him ? that is, to be the impartial custodian of a state, the governor had to do what his conscience told him was in the best interests of the state. He had to be the role model for politicians. 

 The advice of both the prime minister and the president carry a lot of import and would undoubtedly benefit the nation if carried out. But the ground realities are very different from what the president and the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, envisage. At least Singh should not have forgotten what they are if he remembers how his party acted in both Bihar and Goa. The urgency shown by his cabinet to dissolve the assemblies in these states so that the opposition could not get a political advantage is vivid in public memory. Instead of piously repeating words, Singh should try out his prescription before asking others to follow it.

 Yours faithfully,

Subhasish Mohanty, Puri

 Sir ? The president, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, has expressed his disapproval of the role of certain governors during some recent political crises and has asked them to rise above petty politics by overriding ?compulsions emanating either from the Central or the state systems?. While his advice to the governors is welcome, why did Kalam, in the first place, give his assent to dissolve the Bihar assembly while he was abroad? A costly election again within six months could have been avoided had he calculated the repercussions of his approval.

 Yours faithfully,

V. Krishnakumar, New Delhi

 Sir ? The governors may have been advised to be unselfish in their conduct, but experience reveals that it is impossible for active politicians appointed as governors, especially in states where governments have a thin majority, to act impartially. There should be a system to appoint retired judges and senior bureaucrats with distinguished service-record as governors. Also, those who have accepted impartial posts like those of governors, presidents, vice-presidents (and ideally even speakers) must accept these posts only if they can quit active politics. Otherwise, their pensions, perks and privileges should be forfeited. The discretionary powers of governors in selecting chief ministers should be curtailed. Chief ministers should be selected through a secret vote in the assembly based on nominations filed by at least one-third of the members of the house.

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir ? The president and the prime minister have both taken the governors to task. But several important decisions are taken by the president, the chief justice of India and the prime minister himself. Can they swear that they too play their respective roles entirely honestly and are never influenced by extraneous factors? 

 Yours faithfully,

Shiv Shanker Almal, Calcutta

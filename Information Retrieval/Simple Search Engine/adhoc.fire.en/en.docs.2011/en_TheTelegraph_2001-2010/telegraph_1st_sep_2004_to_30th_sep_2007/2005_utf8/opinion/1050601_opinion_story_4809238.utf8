 AN ENGLISH SCHOOL FOR KATNA

 A combination of grit and resourcefulness enabled Jugnu Ramaswamy to set up a school in the middle of nowhere, writes Syeda Hameed

 Dream come true

 Jugnu Ramaswamy had started Jagriti School in 1990 to educate Delhi?s street children. Under the aegis of Street Survivors India, the school, located in Delhi?s Motia Khan slum in Paharganj, began in 1990, and grew from some 30 children to over 500 students. During the 12 years of its existence, it transformed the lives of slum, street and railway-station children. In 2002, the Delhi government, reclaiming valuable commercial space, demolished Motia Khan. Along with it the school too became debris. On June 24, 2002, Jugnu wrote:

 ?The bulldozer works fast. And this one is as mean as they come. Before you can say ?Ananth Kumar? it?s all gone ? several classrooms and a small kitchen where working children once learnt and ate, a hall that sheltered the homeless among them each night and the only tiny toilet to boast of a commode among a squatter population of over 30,000.?

 Then he and his wife, Shabnam Ahmad, decided to continue Jagriti. But by now Jugnu had realized the importance of owning land. He sold his house, collected all his savings and set out for a place where even modest people like him could own their very own piece.

 He decided to take the school to Katna, a village in the Kandi sub-division of Murshidabad district. This is where Shabnam was born and it was from here that, owing to the sagacity of her father (the first graduate of Katna), she went to Darjeeling and Calcutta for school and college education, respectively. He told me that the building had just been completed. He, Shabnam, I and Nurul Amin (a district official who had been sent as my escort) talked for two hours. I forgot how tired I was from the day?s exertions in Berhampore and the 2-hour drive to the village.

 I just listened and listened. I heard Jugnu?s account of how the building came up. All his savings went into buying the land. After Motia Khan, he could not risk another bulldozer ripping apart his dreams. Then came architect friends who understood the environment of rural Bengal and the imperative of cutting corners. Slowly the building started coming up. Meanwhile, he faced untold hardships, political coercion, betrayals, and death threats; so much so that a bomb was hurled at his vehicle and almost got both of them. But he did not give up. Slowly the enemies melted away; the would-be assassin came to touch his feet. The dream had overcome the nightmares.

 By the time we finished talking, dusk had settled in. It was then that I went around the building. Among the verdant paddy fields, in natural terra colours, fringed by ferns and trees, stood the monument of his hard work. The underlying idea of his school was to provide a level playing field for rural children. It aimed to give all advantages, including aesthetic surroundings, quality English-medium education, sports and extra curricular activities to the poorest of the poor village children of Murshidabad and nearby districts. The fact that it was located in Katna village meant that it would reach quality education to many Muslim children, since Katna is almost 98 per cent Muslim. The school was expected to open its doors on May 16, 2005.

 There was no big money behind the school. It was funded entirely by private resources raised by Jugnu from individual donations. On appeal from him, friends just sent what they could. And in his circle, no one is very rich; there are teachers, writers, film-makers. He told me of a man from England who, while getting his boots polished, learnt of a certain school where the little polisher studied. Not believing the boy?s story, he landed in Motia Khan and became a solid supporter of Jugnu?s work. Then there was a long silence ? maybe he was dead. When Jagriti had to be launched and Jugnu was tapping friends, he wrote to the man. In reply came a stout promise, followed by a cheque. While I was in Katna, another friend called to say, give whatever you have on my behalf; I will reimburse you in Delhi.

 The school prospectus, beautifully designed and printed, says tuition fee: Rs 350 per month. Not a large amount when there are schools in metros, which charge Rs 1 lakh a month for the air-conditioned education of privileged kids. But for these beedi-rolling women and men of Murshidabad, even Rs 350 is a huge amount. So Jugnu thought of instituting scholarships for the poorest of the poor.

 So here it was, before my unbelieving eyes; a fully-equipped English medium school on a two-acre campus in this remotest of remote settings. It was a glowing example of the president of India?s idea of PURA ? Provision of Urban Facilities in Rural Areas. Why can?t we replicate it all over the country, I though to myself.

 The next day, many cars pulled up at Jugnu?s house. The entire district administration had landed up to see Jagriti School. ?Look Jugnu, who is here,? Shabnam said. He looked at me with his laughing eyes and said, ?Because you are here. We have been inviting them for months.?

 One day, a month after my visit, with three weeks left for the school opening, Jugnu sat in the school with Shabnam working on the last details. He complained of his stomach hurting. I still recall the divan lying on the side of his desk. He walked there and lay down, breathing heavily. Those were his last breaths. I did not even realize until I read the notice in the papers that he was only 48-years old.

 The question is, what now? Jugnu?s work cannot be allowed to go waste. Shabnam has risen from her mourning to pick up the pieces and continue his mission. Every rupee in the school account is fully committed. Jugnu was just collecting money for three second-hand vehicles in which to transport the children. How will it all come together? But in my heart I know it will. Just a few years, four or five, to create jagriti (awakening) in the community; just a few years of help and Jagriti will become self-sustaining. The cruel twist to the story, Jugnu, has deprived us of you but given a strange new life and vigour to your dream.

 At the end, as I and many friends like me say goodbye, I want to place at Jugnu?s feet two lines of Iqbal which symbolize him, his life and his mission:

 Jugnu ki raushni hai kashana-e-chaman mein

 Ya shama jal rahi hai phoolon ki anjuman mein 

 (Is the glow from firefly which illumines the bower?/ Or is it a candle lit in the assemblage of flowers?)

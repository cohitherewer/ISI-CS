 STEALING FOOD

 Human depravity can sometimes take the most astonishing forms. Mr Achintya Mukherjee is the district inspector of schools in Cooch Behar. He has also been selling foodgrain meant for the schoolchildren?s mid-day meals in the local market for the last three years. Nearly 40,000 quintals, set aside for the local schools by the Food Corporation of India, have been sold since 2003. This is perhaps not the chamber-of-horrors kind of crime, but it exposes an order of corruption that is nevertheless deeply shocking in its lack of scruple and humanity. Yet, this greed cannot be entirely a matter of individual depravity. At some level this has to be systemic ? selling off 40,000 quintals over three years cannot be pulled off by a single person. Whatever its nature, Mukherjee?s heinousness strikes at the roots of two crucial areas of government action ? primary education and nutrition.

 If the mid-day meal scheme can be made to work in West Bengal, then it could be a solution to a number of problems. The number of drop-outs from the district and rural government schools had reached an acute level. Students were initially given slips for collecting foodgrain from ration outlets, and this did not succeed in ensuring their regular attendance. It was not enticing enough, or the children would turn up only on the days when the slips were given out. But cooked meals are now beginning to work better in this respect, and some schools ? like the Hamiltonganj Primary School in Jalpaiguri ? have devised ways of using their grants and rations in such a way that the quality of food being served has also improved dramatically. This has, in turn, shown a marked rise in the children?s eagerness to come to school regularly. The government is now considering other ways of making school a more attractive prospect for the children. Playing facilities, ensuring the premises look less dismal, eco-clubs and other academic and non-academic improvements are seriously being considered and, in some instances, being implemented. And all this also means a re-allocation of funds. This is the scenario in which Mr Mukherjee has been stealing food ? from severely under-privileged children, in whose lives being fed and being made literate are vitally linked. The government should not hesitate to weed such inhuman elements out of its human development schemes.

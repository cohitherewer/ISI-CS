 THINK BEFORE YOU LEAP

 Gwynne Dyer

 Some of the early reactions to the French and Dutch ?No? votes on the new European constitution were quite hysterical. ?I may no longer practice medicine but I can tell a corpse when I see one,? crowed Liam Fox, Conservative shadow foreign secretary, giving voice to the joy of the Europhobes in the House of Commons. And the current occupant of the European Union presidency, Luxemburg prime minister, Jean-Claude Juncker, said that the French ?No? would be ?a catastrophe for France, for Chirac, and for the entire world.?

 Really? The entire world? That?s a bit extreme. Two of the EU?s 25 countries have rejected a treaty that was meant to bring more efficiency, flexibility and democracy to a half-century-old organization that has recently expanded dramatically but still functions reasonably well. And although the shock of the two ?No? votes was considerable, as the dust settled, it became clear that neither electorate was actually voting against the European enterprise as a whole.

 They were both alienated by a sense that an out-of-touch transnational European elite was foisting this new constitution on them, and they both felt that the EU was expanding too fast. They were particularly alarmed by the prospect of eventual Turkish membership. But mainly, they were just fed up with their own governments.

 Old rules

 You can see why a lot of European voters are cross. The British, Spanish and Scandinavian economies are doing just fine and the new members in eastern Europe are growing very fast, but almost all the countries in the old EU heartland have been stuck in a low-growth mode for a decade. Unemployment is over 10 per cent in both France and Germany, and would be the same in Italy if they were not better at hiding it. Then there are local factors like the widespread loathing in France for the sleazy and corrupt Chirac and the recent surge in anti-Muslim feelings in the Netherlands.

 So the Dutch and French voters were a bit muddled in their motives, but a ?No? is still a ?No?. What has the EU lost as a result? Momentum, mainly. Almost all its projects for modernization and further expansion will now be stalled, at least for a time. Romania and Bulgaria, next in the queue to join, will probably make it in 2006 or in 2007, but Croatia will have to wait for a while. Turkey?s accession talks will start as scheduled, but their eventual outcome is now in considerable doubt.

 Cheer up

 What else? Well, there will be no new voting rules that let most proposals pass on ?qualified majorities,? with only defence, foreign affairs and budgetary issues subject to unanimity among the 25 members. It will be the old rules, where just one dissenting vote can veto almost any decision, but the EU has survived this long with that system. The euro, meanwhile, has plunged in value, falling below par with the US dollar but few exporters in Europe will feel sad about that.

 The EU summit in Brussels in June will mull all this over, but the likely outcome is a ?pause for reflection.? As Polish president, Aleksander Kwasniewski, said, the 25 governments ?may decide to give ourselves a few months and meet (again) when we are better prepared. A lack of a decision is also a decision.?

 Eight countries have already ratified the constitution, and a dozen others might easily do so in the next 16 months. Then there would have to be a prolonged haggling session in the European Council, but if the voters in key western European countries have cheered up by then, something resembling the current constitution could eventually emerge from the shambles. And if not, then the EU just trundles down the existing track until everybody does cheer up. This is a setback, not a disaster.

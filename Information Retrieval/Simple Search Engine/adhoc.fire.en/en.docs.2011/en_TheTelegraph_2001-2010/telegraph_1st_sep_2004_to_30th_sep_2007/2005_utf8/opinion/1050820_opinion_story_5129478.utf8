 CALCULATED MOVES

 THIS ABOVE ALL 

/ KHUSHWANT SINGH

 Framed?

 Our politicians are so eager to stay in the news that no sooner an occurrence takes place, than they rush to make statements to the media, without bothering to look at the facts, without considering the merits of the case. The more outrageous their utterances, the better the chances of making it to the front pages of newspapers and to prime time on TV channels. They are equally eager to contradict what they have said earlier or complain that they have been quoted out of context. More publicity. When they discover that they had got it all wrong, they observe maun brat (vow of silence) for a while and wait for the next occurrences to shoot their mouths again.

 Two examples of recent times are the arrests of the sankaracharya of Kanchipuram and his deputy and the hoo-haa over charges against Bibi Jagir Kaur, president of the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee. As soon as they heard of warrants of arrest being issued against the sankaracharya, leaders of the sangh parivar denounced it as an assault on Hindu dharma. Front page. Some flew down to Kanchipuram to be photographed touching the feet of the sage and assuring him of their full support. But the man had been charged with abetment to murder, for paying huge sums of money from math funds to hired assassins and propositioning women devotees. When all this came out, the self-proclaimed protectors of Hindu Dharma fell silent. Their purpose had been served.

 It was somewhat the same in the case of Bibi Jagir Kaur. Her involvement in the mysterious death of her daughter, who married someone against her mother?s wishes, is under investigation. She is now being questioned for fudging accounts and has been suspended from her post. Notwithstanding the charges, one faction of the Akali Dal declared it as an attack on the Sikh panth. And got the media coverage they wanted.

 These antics are performed by politicians who are out of power. Those who have kursees large enough to accommodate their fat bottoms, ensure that their publicity departments use public funds lavishly to buy spaces in leading journals to carry their photographs along with those of Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh to extol the wonderful work they are doing for the uplift of the poor. Narendra Modi of Gujarat used pictures of Gandhi alongside his own to prove that he was a devout chela of the Bapu. Have they no shame?

 Divine offering

 It was my first meeting with a yogi who spends his life in a cave overlooking the sacred Ganga near its birthplace, Gangotri. I record as honestly as I can our dialogue with some mirch-masala permitted to a scribe. Needless to say I cannot divulge his name.

 One morning my phone rang and a male voice at the other end asked if he could speak to me. I replied that it was I he was speaking to: ?Hari Om Tat Sat,? he greeted me loudly. I responded with equal gusto: ?Hari Om Tat Sat.? He asked if he could drop in for a few minutes to discuss some spiritual matters with me. He had evidently read somethings written by me. I was flattered. He also knew I was a nastik ? a non-believer.

 A few minutes later, my door bell rang. I opened the door to let him in. He was a stockily-built young man, in his late thirties, passably handsome with large lustrous eyes, sporting a small clipped beard and clad in a saffron one-piece cloth which covered most of his body. As he took his seat, I asked him: ?Swamiji, tell me something about yourself; where are you from and what made you turn into a yogi??

 He replied: ?I am from Kurukshetra. I went to school and college there. Right from the beginning, I was interested in spiritual matters and studied yoga. I decided to turn into a yogi. I found a gufa (cave) near Gangotri and decided to make it my home.? ?It must be hard living alone with no one to look after you,? I interjected. ?I took a servant to cook for me. We took provisions for six months on a pack of mules. During winter, the snow cut us off from the rest of the world. Come to think of it, items like rice, flour, daal, ghee, salt and spices are all satvik food; one can do without fresh vegetables or fruit for many months.?

 ?What did you do all day?? ?Yoga abhyaas and I read books I took with me. I wrote to myself in Hindi and English. I get a little income from their sales. It is enough for me.? ?What did you get from all this tapasya?? I asked. He paused a while before replying. ?I found that pranayam is the basis of yoga. Without pranayam no amount of chanting of mantras is of any effect.?

 I was out of my depth. I do not know pranayam and the only mantra I know by heart is the Gayatri without being clear about its meaning. I changed the subject to one closer to my heart. ?Swamiji, have you taken a vow of celibacy? Are you a brahmachari?? he smiled and took his time to reply. ?I am not a grihasth (householder) with wife and children. About brahmacharya, I am not sure.?

 ?What do you mean??

 ?You see at times foreign lady tourists come to see what kinds of lives we yogis living in caves lead. Some are bold enough to ask for sambandh (union) with them to preserve in their memories. One such lady came my way. Main nay unko bhog lagaaya.?

 I was charmed by the expression; not a vulgar four letter word in English or equally coarse words in India languages, but sex as an act of worship: bhog to the goddess of erotica. The only snag is that while stone goddesses are impassive receivers of adoration and prasaad, human goddesses are expected to take an equal part in this rite of worship.

 The foreign lady recipient of Swamiji?s favours passed the word round to her friends. So while he dwells in a Himalayan cave, he manages to get the best of both worlds.

 Sound judgment

 Sign outside a radioshop: ?Our business is Sound?

 Prompto: ?We are prompt, no matter how long it takes.?

 The reason why: ?You married me because I had money,? complained the wife.

 ?No, honey. I married you because I didn?t have.?

 FAREWELL TO ARMS

 The British Isles are now riven by a strange contradiction. London is adjusting to a form of terror that involves its people in what the most powerful nation in the modern world calls a war. And at the heart of this ?war? is religion. But another war seems to be ending in the isles. The Irish Republican Army ? more precisely, the leadership of the ?glaigh na h?ireann ? has ?formally ordered an end to the armed campaign? it had been conducting against Britain for more than three decades. At the heart of this war, too, there is religion. Some Irish Catholics have been violently resisting the rule of British Protestants. The roots of this violent sectarian conflict go back to the 16th century, though formalized by Cromwell?s massacre of Irish Catholics in the 17th. The 20th-century origins of this conflict may be traced back to the Easter Rising of 1916, when Irish rebels were put down by 20,000 British soldiers and their leaders executed. Ireland?s greatest modern poet marked this year as one in which all was ?changed utterly?, and a ?terrible beauty...born?. In the Nineties, two ceasefires declared by the IRA were unsuccessful, alternating with paramilitary killings on both sides. 

 But talks had begun, from 1994, between the British government and the banned IRA?s legal political wing, the Sinn F?in. Everyday life and civil society in Northern Island had, by then, been thoroughly ravaged and deeply divided by mistrust and terror. Yet the Good Friday agreement was carried through in 1998, and its objectives are what the IRA, in its newly peaceful mode, want to see fully implemented.

 What is remarkable about this declaration is its clarity and unconditionality. This is perhaps why Mr Tony Blair thinks it is ?of a different order to anything before?. The IRA would put its arms ?verifiably? beyond use, and this ?decommissioning? will be witnessed by independent and international monitoring commissions, together with representatives of the Protestant and Catholic churches. Even in disarmament, faith and politics will remain inseparably intertwined ? the enduring legacy of this long conflict. The declaration also forbids IRA volunteers to ?engage in any other activities?, and this has been widely interpreted as a formal renunciation of criminality and abuse of paramilitary power. The huge bank robbery in Northern Ireland last year, followed by the knifing of Robert McCartney, gives a sense of the range of the IRA?s ?activities? in recent times. The IRA had come to be seen as the Catholic community?s only defence against Protestants and the British authorities.

 This is the tradition of violence that has to be reversed by the IRA and its followers in order to prove the sincerity of their words of peace that continue to assert that the IRA?s armed struggle was ?entirely legitimate?. Whether or not this happens will determine the momentousness of this event. Yet, the IRA?s clear, quiet declaration will, perhaps, make the world look a little more hopefully at the deadlocks in, say, west Asia and Kashmir.

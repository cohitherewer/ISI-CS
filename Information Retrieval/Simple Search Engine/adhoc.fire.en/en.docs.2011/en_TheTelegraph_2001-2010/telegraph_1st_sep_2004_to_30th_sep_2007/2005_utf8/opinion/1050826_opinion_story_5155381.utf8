 OLD TRICK OF OIL AND WATER

 MALVIKA SINGH

 When one reads a headline in a national daily saying, ?Bengal has to reform or perish, says Buddha in Singapore hardsell,? one feels heartened, particularly for Bengal, a state that is bound to pull itself out of the past with a chief minister who is bold enough to speak a new language, different from his politburo colleagues in New Delhi. At the same forum he also called for a ?change of mindset? and said that in Bengal the left had discarded its dogmas and understood the reality of economic reforms. ?We are not fools,? he said. And thank god for that. How odd that Manmohan Singh is beginning to sound like an erstwhile left leader and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee like a liberal Congressman.

 Sadly, leaders of the CPI(M) in Delhi speak a completely different language. Prakash Karat and Bhattacharjee come across as oil and water. Is this a deliberate attempt to pander to different economic levels and needs? Does the left want to discredit Manmohan Singh and the UPA for doing nothing substantial and present their own chief minister as the man who delivered the goods in this new age? Are they trying to show the lefties as being more progressive than the righties? Is this doublespeak a trick that all extreme parties indulge in because they have no other way of admitting their failures and because of the need to come to terms with changing realities? Is posturing of this nature detrimental to our young nation, one that is trying to keep pace with the rest of the world and is being held back? 

 Left behind

 What is their game? If the left is adamant about stalling every move that the UPA wants to make, the UPA may as well take decisions that it believes in, let the left parties pull the rug if they have the guts to do so and sit in the opposition, allowing other dispensations get on with it. This new board game, ?regression?, is setting India and Bharat back by decades. No economic group, no community, either rich or poor, will win. India will continue to wallow under the rhetoric of a bygone age with not one new idea, methodology or system that needs to be generated brought into play to replace the failed ideologies and idioms of the last 58 years. This ruling generation will leave behind an untenable legacy. And there is no one who wants to take on the challenge of bringing real change. They run scared at the thought of having to dirty their fingers. 

 The Congress has been overwhelmed, maybe even choked, by the influence of the CPI(M) in Delhi where the government appears to have abdicated its beliefs and is playing to the tune of Karat and his team. They are stymied and fast becoming a laughing stock. The UPA seems to be faced with ongoing situations that smack of ?blackmail?. Another opportunity has slipped away. Increasingly one hears comments about the similarities of all the political dispensations in India, how there is no real difference. The time is right for the launch of a new, thinking and committed political party. Since governance is not forthcoming and fundamental correctives are not happening, how much longer will this nation have to mark time? 

 Is the UPA going to reorganize the states in the Indian Union? Is it going to break Uttar Pradesh into four and break the stranglehold that one state has on the decision of who rules from Delhi? Are the larger states, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and UP, going to be made into manageable units? Is the government going to drop visa requirements for SAARC countries? Is our fossil service going to carry on operating within a time warp? Or is it going to merely push through bills in parliament that can never be implemented? Is it going to grab from Peter to pay Paul? Is it going to be populism with no serious intent? It is, sadly, beginning to look like that.

 DESPITE THE DISTANCE

 Beena Sarwar

 In 2004, 527 women were ?assassinated? in Guatemala; this year, the figure is 238 already. It is, says the Guatemalan journalist, Marielos Monzon, a ?problem of immunity? because 73 per cent of these crimes are not investigated. When those responsible are not brought to book, the crime will continue.

 International human rights organizations, says Marielos, have said that the police are involved in these killings. Why are women being killed in such large numbers? The government and the police answer that either these women were involved in crimes, or ?not behaving well? at home.

 If all this sounds familiar to the Pakistani reader, there?s more. Guatemala has been at war for 36 years, a war that has resulted in over 250,000 deaths, and 50,000 disappearances. A million people have been displaced. The peace accords signed in 1996 ?did not affect the structures? of what Marielos calls the ?hidden powers?, the organized crime rings that the war culture has helped to nurture and strengthen. These structures were responsible for the deaths of as many as 3,600 people last year, and the over 9,000 injured by guns.

 In Pakistan, we have a similar situation with the elements nurtured during the ?Afghan jihad?. Since the end of the war, these ?structures? have turned their guns on people within the country, leading to a rise in sectarian tension. Thousands have been killed in the violence over the last two decades, while over a thousand women were reported killed in 2004 alone. Here too, it is ?a problem of immunity?, with the guilty rarely, if ever, being punished. A case in point is how the guilty in the Mukhtaran Mai case were acquitted by the courts although they are known to be guilty, simply because the prosecution did not build a strong enough case.

 In Guatemala, the violence and murders ?are the figures of a country at war, but Guatemala is not at war,? points out Marielos, who has herself been in danger for following up on stories that threatened these vested interests.

 Breed apart

 Marielos started investigating the murder of a family killed in 1981. Among those tortured and killed in the case was a young, pregnant woman. After killing her, the murderers took her baby boy and are believed to have sold him in Europe or the US. Marielos tracked down the doctors and lawyers who knew about that transaction, and wrote a couple of reports based on her findings.

 It was after this that she began to be threatened. At one point, five armed men barged into her house. Her children were then 9 and 11 years old, and as they left, the intruders took away their puppy. Some weeks later, they came to the house again while she was away, and threatened the children. ?We had to leave Guatemala for three months,? says Marielos, the winner of the 2003 Courage in Journalism Award, presented by the International Women?s Media Foundation (a Pakistani journalist, the Newsline editor Razia Bhatti, received this prestigious award in 1994).

 It is in such situations that women journalists can be considered a different breed from their male colleagues. They have their children to think of ? not that men don?t, but mothers with small children have a different role and responsibility. ?You then wonder whether it is worth it to keep writing about such things,? says Marielos. 

 ?Journalists can?t be neutral,? says Marielos as we discuss the issue of ?objectivity?, which I believe is not possible ? the best one can do is be fair and open to all points of view. We?re at a Unesco seminar to commemorate Women?s Day in Paris, the theme being ?Gender Equality Beyond 2005: Building a More Secure Future for Women Reporters.? ?No, we can?t be ?objective?. How can I be neutral when people are selling the babies of massacred people for five thousand US dollars?? she asks.

 FIELD WORK

 There was supposed to be a group of ministers meeting to ratify the commerce ministry?s negotiating position for the World Trade Organization?s imminent Hong Kong ministerial. It was postponed. But the meeting was irrelevant, as there has been no significant movement on WTO, and the Hong Kong ministerial seems destined for a Cancun-type failure. The key impediment continues to be agriculture, although there are issues in non-agricultural manufactured products and less contentious concerns in services. From the developed-country perspective, agricultural liberalization has been reduced to market access, implying reductions in tariffs, although developing countries can have greater flexibility through reduced commitments, exemption of special products and incorporation of a special safeguards clause. The reduced commitment is a function of the formula used, an issue that also plagues non-agricultural market access. 

 But market access de-linked from domestic agricultural support and export subsidies makes no sense, because they distort agricultural markets. The Doha work programme and the framework agreement adopted on July 31, 2004 speak of reduction of agricultural subsidies. Driven by French resistance, the European Union offer is simply not good enough. Both the EU and the United States of America offers allow export subsidies to actually increase, because they bite not on actual subsidies, but bound commitments.

 To complicate matters, not all developing countries want export subsidy elimination, since net-food importing developing countries may suffer. Indeed, developing countries that benefit from duty concessions also suffer relatively if NAMA duties are reduced. Hence, there continue to be disagreements about the formula, some formulae suggested by developed countries involving more than proportionate duty cuts by developing countries. And Mr Kamal Nath also faces the domestic political economy of resistance, especially acute for agriculture, and within agriculture, for items like dairy products and edible oils. Unlike in the Uruguay Round, developing countries like India, South Africa, China and Brazil have a stronger voice now, articulated through G-20. It is thus difficult to ram an agreement down their throats, as was done through the Blair House accord. From an Indian perspective, no agreement in Hong Kong is better than a hollow agreement. There is a compulsion in completing negotiations quickly, because the US president?s fast-track authority expires in December 2006 and Mr Pascal Lamy may convene another post-Hong Kong mini-ministerial in April 2006 to break the impasse. But the Uruguay Round also went through such hiccups and, unlike in the Uruguay Round, India is in a comfortable position to call the developed countries? bluff.

 DOWN, BUT NOT OUT

 Sourav Ganguly has more than a bad patch and a sore elbow to contend with. One careless stroke and the Prince of Calcuttas dramatic story may end prematurely

HITTING 

OUT

Other notable comebacks: 

 SHANE WARNE: Took 10 wickets against Sri Lanka in 2004 

after a one-year ban

 IMRAN KHAN: Retired in 1988, then led Pakistan to a series 

draw in West Indies and to the World Cup 

 MOHINDER AMARNATH: Returned to the team in 1983 to face 

the West Indian pace battery

 BOBBY SIMPSON: Coming out of retirement, led Australia 

to a series 

victory against India in 1977-78.

 If it doesnt happen, the most delectable off-drives that have mesmerised opponents and spectators the world over and the most majestic, lofted shots over bowlers heads will pass into history. And India will perhaps have to wait for years for a captain who will grit his teeth, clench his fists, swear at opponents, slow down over-rates, promote a band of talented youngsters and do whatever else is possible to win a game of cricket. 

 But if we are talking about a comeback, Sourav Ganguly is no stranger to the phenomenon. In fact, he is possibly scripting another one with his splendid century in the ongoing Duleep Trophy at Indore that is no less dramatic than the one he staged at the headquarters of cricket nine years back. Only this time, the odds are even more heavily stacked against him. And the Prince of Calcutta is no longer the strapping young man of 24 who used his bat like a magic wand to hammer a century on that sunny afternoon at Lords. 

 Gangulys decade-old international career has seen him reach amazing heights and hit the occasional troughs in between. In tandem with Sachin Tendulkar, he scored tonnes of runs in one-dayers and played several scorching knocks to seal his place in the side. Then came captaincy and the Behala boy was least daunted by the task. Instead, he basked in its glory, raised his game by a few notches and had a major hand in building a young spirited side that reached the World Cup final. 

 As his team went from strength to strength, Sourav the batsman took a backseat. Opponents exploited his reliance on off-side play to sort him out. Fast bowlers pitched the ball short to cramp his strokes on the leg side. The reins of batting passed on to the Dravids, Sachins and Sehwags while Gangulys contribution kept dwindling. 

 Until about a year ago when it virtually dried up altogether. Critics were baying for his blood. You cant have a non-playing captain, they argued. The criticism was not unfounded. Every time he went out to bat, even the staunchest Ganguly fan knew it was a matter of time before he edged one to the wicket keeper or the slips. Things were just not working out. 

 But the man himself remained unaffected by this national debate on whether it was time for him to bow out. That public-school swagger was not missing, the confidence was in place and his trademark aggressive leadership was still good enough to win a series in Pakistan for the first time. But the pressure was slowly eating into the confidence. And it caught up with Indias performance last season when it lost all important series and tournaments. The skipper finally had his back to the wall. 

 Not an unfamiliar situation for the stylish left-hander. He had been written off before. After his maiden international trip to Australia as a raw19-year-old, Ganguly was accused of having an attitude problem. He refused to carry drinks into the field, behaved like a maharajah, said the managers report. With nothing to show in terms of performance, he spent four years in the wilderness before that remarkable comeback. 

 An encore is definitely on the cards but it wont be easy. He is no longer the energetic teenager that he was 13 years back. Captaincy takes its toll on your mind and body. Once you have crossed 30 you are always going to be up against it. But I think he will pull it off once again and regain captaincy. He has it in him, says former national selector Sambaran Banerjee. 

 Others, like Banerjee, still swear by his legendary grit and his eagerness to prove critics wrong. Former Bengal captain Ashok Malhotra recalls how Ganguly would anxiously wait for the batting line-up to be announced before each innings in domestic matches while he was out of the national team in the early Nineties. If he was at number five, he would plead with me to be promoted to three or four so that he could score and draw the selectors attention. This hunger for success kept him going through the difficult period. And it is this passion that will help him win his place back provided he has got enough of it left in him. He is a great player and I think he will bounce back, says Malhotra. 

 But this time, the southpaw has got more than just a bad patch and a sore elbow to contend with. The powerful opposition camp in the cricket board ? which has been lobbying hard for his ouster ?has its knives out. The Chappell-Ganguly row has given them the perfect launching pad to go for the jugular. 

 Seen as close to Jagmohan Dalmiya, insiders believe Ganguly will never regain captaincy and possibly even lose his place in the national team for good if the ruling faction fails to win the BCCI elections next month. Even if he does get back the hot seat, his own coach would be breathing down his neck demanding better performance and a higher fitness level. Since Chappell believes Sourav has outlived his utility period as a captain, it be will difficult for them to strike up a working relationship, says Banerjee. 

 Experts believe its time to tread with caution and get priorities right. One wrong move here, and the Sourav Ganguly story might end prematurely. So ambitions must not take precedence. It might not be a bad idea to give up captaincy and stay in the side as a batsman. He has led the side for five years, been the most successful captain. What more can one ask for? asks Arun Lal, former test cricketer. 

 Captaincy once again, the diehard Ganguly fan might say. For Dravids insipid style, even Chappell will agree, is not a patch on Gangulys aggression that tamed Australia and Pakistan. But for that to happen, those silken drives must start flowing again, like it did on that fateful afternoon at Lords.

 The Others as the winners

Al-Jazeera: How Arab TV news challenged the world (Abacus, ? 4.99) by Hugh Miles is a brilliant work on the Qatar-based television channel which gave a new meaning to the term ?media war?. Al-Jazeera burst into the scene as Osama bin Laden?s chosen messenger, fuelling speculations that it is an orthodox Islamic news channel. But, as Hugh Miles discovers, ?it looks like any other news channel. The anchors look much like they do in the West. The men wear suits and the women wear make-up and no veils, and while some wear headscarves, others have plunging necklines.? Al-Jazeera is even credited with the first female Arab sports reporter. And this is not the only frontier that it has crossed. It has taken on the mighty Americans, and to this day, withstood attempts by the US and other Western nations to suppress its coverage. The CNN interview with Al-Jazeera?s Washington correspondent in 2001, Hafez al-Mirazi, is a real gem, where he makes mincemeat of the Western media, for always instigating ?against an independent media like Al-Jazeera, because they (sic.) do what the American media cannot do, which is not to mix patriotism with journalism?.

 Winning (HarperCollins, ? 12.99) by Jack Welch (with Suzy Welch) is full of infantile pseudo-profundities such as ?I think winning is great. Not good great. Because when companies win, people thrive and grow. There are more jobs and more opportunities? and ?leaders never score off their own people by stealing an idea and claiming it as their own?. If indeed managers need the help of books like this to be good at their job, then it must be time to sing a requiem to that old fogey called common sense.

 Puranic tales for cynical people (Indialog, Rs 250) by Parashuram are translations, perhaps for the first time, of some of the finest tales by Parashuram. The effort is worth a great deal of praise, but sadly, the execution falls way below expectation. The fun of Parashuram?s mythological tales comes from the situation as well as from the language. In the translations by Pradip Bhattacharya and Shekhar Sen, the situational fun is unmistakable, but the fun from the language is lost completely, in stodgy, unwieldy English. And that is most unfortunate, since Rajshekhar Basu is arguably the best translator into Bengali of our two greatest epics.

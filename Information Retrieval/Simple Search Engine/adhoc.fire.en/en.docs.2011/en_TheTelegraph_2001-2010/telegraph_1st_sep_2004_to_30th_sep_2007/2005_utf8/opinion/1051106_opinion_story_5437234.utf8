 Letters to Editor

 More sound than light

 Sir ? It is a pity that the police failed to control noise pollution in some parts of Calcutta during Diwali despite the ban on noisy firecrackers. What?s more, the cops seem unwilling to admit this. One wonders why the police decided to look the other way even as children, old men and women, and patients in hospitals trembled under the onslaught of loud crackers. If the cops had managed to fine the culprits, the state exchequer would have been richer by a few thousand. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Manish Chandra Bose, Calcutta

 On a roll

 Sir ? The four consecutive wins over Sri Lanka have given enough indication that Indian cricket is on the right track. The captain, Rahul Dravid, and the coach, Greg Chappell, should be given the credit for the team?s successful run. A few questions, however,remain unanswered. Do these victories signal the end of the road for Sourav Ganguly? Ganguly still has it in him to perform at the highest level for a couple of more years, and Indian cricket would benefit immensely from Ganguly?s talent and experience. 

 It is imperative that the selectors try and resolve the differences between Chappell and Ganguly. They need to make it clear to Ganguly that a former captain can win his place back if he continues to score runs and stays clear of confrontations with the coach. It may be a good idea if the selectors convince Ganguly to apologize to Chappell. Ganguly and Chappell can surely put their differences behind them quickly with a little help from the selectors,

 Yours faithfully,

K.B.Goswami, Calcutta

 Sir ? The series-win against Sri Lanka has shown that the Indian team performs better with Rahul Dravid at the helm. This means it?s curtains for Dada, who must have realized by now that his playing days are over not just because of poor form but also because he has failed to inspire the players. Greg Chappell is determined that the current crop of players make a mark for themselves on the international stage. That can only mean good things for Indian cricket.

 Yours faithfully

 Sir ? The Indian players and the coach deserve praise for their astounding performance against Sri Lanka. For once, let us forget about the Ganguly-Chappell fiasco and concentrate on the performance of the side. It has been some time since India managed to play such good cricket and there are a couple of men who can be credited for this turnaround ? Sachin Tendulkar, whose presence gave that much-needed confidence to the players, especially the new ones, as well as Dravid and Chappell who have combined well during the series. The promotion of different players to the number 3 slot has reaped rich dividends. It is also good to see that the Indian team has started to think beyond fading stars like Kumble, Laxman, Zaheer Khan and Nehra. Chappell?s innovative policy of rotating batting positions and his decision to try out new players helped India get the better of their more-fancied opponents. Even after winning the series, the players need to make sure that they do not become complacent. Instead they should try and cement their place in the side. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sumant Poddar, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The way the Indian cricket team is playing proves that Greg Chappell means business and has his eyes fixed on the World Cup. Bengalis may be peeved with Chappell over his tiff with Ganguly but what the coach has done is in the larger interest of the country.

 Yours faithfully,

 Basudeb Bhattacharya, Calcutta

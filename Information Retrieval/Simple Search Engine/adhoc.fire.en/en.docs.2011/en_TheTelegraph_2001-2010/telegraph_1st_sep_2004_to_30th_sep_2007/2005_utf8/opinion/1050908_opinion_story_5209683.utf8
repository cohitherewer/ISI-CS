 MINIMIZING THE RISK

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the government of India?s status report on Disaster Management in India, August 2004

 A national core group for earthquake risk mitigation has been constituted consisting of experts in earthquake engineering and administrators. The core group has been assigned with the responsibility of drawing up a strategy and plan of action for mitigating the impact of earthquakes; providing advice and guidance to the states on various aspects of earthquake mitigation; developing/organizing the preparation of handbooks/pamphlets/designs for earthquake resistant construction; working out systems for assisting the states in the seismically vulnerable zones to adopt/integrate appropriate Bureau of Indian Standards codes in their building bylaws; evolving systems for training of municipal engineers as also practising architects and engineers in the private sector in the salient features of BIS codes and the amended bylaws; evolving a system of certification of architects/engineers for testing their knowledge of earthquake resistant construction; evolving systems for training of masons and carry out intensive awareness generation campaigns.

 Review of building by-laws and their adoption: Most casualties during earthquakes are caused by the collapse of structures. Therefore structural mitigation measures are the key to make a significant impact towards earthquake safety in our country. In view of this the states in earthquake-prone zones have been requested to review, and if necessary, amend their building by-laws...

 Many states have initiated necessary action in this regard. An expert committee appointed by the core group has already submitted its report covering appropriate amendments to the existing town and country planning acts, land use zoning regulation, development control regulations amp; building bylaws, which could be used by the state governments and the local bodies thereunder to upgrade the existing legal instruments. The model building bylaws also cover the aspect of ensuring technical implementation of the safety aspects in all new constructions and upgrading the strength of existing structurally vulnerable constructions. To facilitate the review of existing building bylaws and adoption of the proposed amendments by the state governments and UT administrations, discussion workshops at regional level in the country are being organized...

 There are BIS codes which are relevant for multi-hazard resistant design and construction... An action plan has been drawn up for revision of existing codes, development of new codes and documents/commentaries, and making these codes and documents available all over the country including on-line access to these codes. An apex committee consisting of representatives of ministry of consumer affairs, BIS and MHA has been constituted to review the mechanism and process of development of codes relevant to earthquake risk mitigation and establish a protocol for revision by BIS.

 The states have been advised to constitute hazard safety cells...with necessary engineering staff so as to establish mechanism for proper implementation of the building codes in all future government constructions, and to ensure the safety of buildings and structures from various hazards. The HSCs will also be responsible for carrying out appropriate design review of all government buildings to be constructed in the state, act as an advisory cell to the state government on the different aspects of building safety... and act as a consultant to the state government for retrofitting of the lifeline buildings. Rajasthan, West Bengal, Delhi and Chhattisgarh have already constituted these cells...

 Two national programmes for capacity building in earthquake risk mitigation for engineers and architects respectively, have been approved to assist the state governments in building up capacities for earthquake mitigation. Under these two programmes 10,000 engineers and 10,000 architects in the states will be given training in seismically-safe building designs and related techno-legal requirements. Assistance is being provided to the state/UTs to build the capacities of more than 125 state engineering colleges and 110 architecture colleges to be able to provide advisory services to the state governments to put in place appropriate techno-legal regime, assessment of building and infrastructures and their retrofitting. Twenty-one engineering and architecture institutions have been designated as National Resource Institutes to train the faculty members of selected state engineering and architecture colleges ? 450 engineering faculty members and 250 architecture faculty members of these state Resource Institutions will be trained...

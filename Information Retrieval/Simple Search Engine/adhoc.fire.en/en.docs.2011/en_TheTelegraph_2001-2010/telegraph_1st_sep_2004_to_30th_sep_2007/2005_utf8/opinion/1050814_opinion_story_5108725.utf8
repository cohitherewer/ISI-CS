 Letters to Editor

 Empty seats and rhetoric

 Sir ? Is it really necessary to let the world know that the largest democracy in the world is run by invisible MPs? Most of the days when parliament is in session, we are faced with the sight of empty seats in the two houses, whose supposed occupants do not feel a drop of guilt in drawing the considerable benefits of their position without putting in an appearance. And we wonder if the money spent in televising our parliamentary proceedings could not be better utilized in feeding those who do not get two square meals a day?

 Yours faithfully,

A.P. Lahiri, Calcutta

 Going by the law

 Sir ? It is perhaps without precedent that the highest judicial body of the country considered it necessary to invite the attention of the highest executive of the country to the apparent wilful miscarriage of a court order by a state (?PM handed riot order?, Aug 11). Does it not show up the helplessness of the Supreme Court, which does not have any executive powers? 

 This move by the apex court should be enough to force the chief minister of the state in question ? namely Gujarat ? Narendra Modi, to resign from his post. In fact, Modi will be wiser for doing so, since the court has made it clear that if the Gujarat director general of police fails to satisfy it on the next date of hearing, then the prime minister, after duly consulting the Gujarat governor, will have every right to supercede the government for the break-down of constitutional discipline.

 Yours faithfully,

Rabindra Nath Bhattacherjee, Durgapur

 Sir ? It was heartening to find the three-judge bench of the Supreme Court reminding the minorities commission about the dangers of encouraging groups demanding minority status on the basis of their religious affiliation (?Minority wake-up call?, Aug 11). In their policy of ?divide and rule?, the British had encouraged this tendency, resulting in the partition of the country. In present-day electoral politics, fraught with religious overtones, the observation of the bench is pertinent: We are ?..making our country akin to a theocratic state based on multi-nationalism.?

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? While denying minority-status to Jains, the Supreme Court has rightly commented that the country is already threatened by class and social conflicts. It is obvious that class-divides are reinforced by the policy of ?reservation?, though our constitutional fathers recommended it only for a short term. ?Reserved? groups become separated from the national mainstream, while there are plenty of people who reap unlawful benefits of the policy.

 The plight of the Hindu Pandits in the Kashmir valley suggests that if at all minority-status is to be granted, then it should be only at the state-level. Ideally, of course, a homogeneous mixing of the population should be encouraged by abolishing minority-status once and for all. The existing legal provisions are sufficient to take care of the needs of the minority communities.

 Yours faithfully,

Subhash C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir ? It is good that the Supreme Court has recognized the contribution of Lok Adalats, and considered the latter?s decree to be equal to that of the courts. This will spell relief for hundreds of rural litigants involved in land and property disputes. They will now have to spend less time and money to get justice. Even lawyers must encourage clients to go to Lok Adalats for minor disputes, to reduce the workload on the courts. With less backlog, the courts might be able to function more efficiently.

 Yours faithfully,

B.S. Ganesh, Bangalore

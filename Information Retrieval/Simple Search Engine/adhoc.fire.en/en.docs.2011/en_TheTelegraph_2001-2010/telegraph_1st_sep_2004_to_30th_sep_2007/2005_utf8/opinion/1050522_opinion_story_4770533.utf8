 Manmohans Bharat One Year on

 Just one programme ? the midday meal scheme ? is all the UPA regime can flaunt to prove its good intentions for rural India. Bishakha De Sarkar reports the ground realities

 FOOD FOR THOUGHT: Schools that provide nourishment for children report higher attendance

 Its the last day of school before it breaks for summer, and the heady aroma of asli ghee ensures that the children are in their classrooms, awaiting lunch. 

 A midday meal is in progress in village Bichpuri in the Agra district of Uttar Pradesh. Scores of small students, most with matted hair and tattered clothes, sit against the walls of the classroom, as teachers and aides dole out hot puris and a potato curry. Its a special meal ? school principal Uttam Singh says, to mark the end of term. 

 Just a kilometre away, the children of the Dalit village of Chauhatana have finished their lunch of sticky rice and a lentil gruel. The leftover looks unappetising, but the teachers stress that the children have had their fill. In Chauhatana, where meals are at best an uncertainty, a daily scoop of rice and dal is a luxury. Bichpuri, the relatively more affluent village may have its puris, the Dalit children of Chauhatana are happy with any hot meal. 

 In village India, the first year of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government of Manmohan Singh is, unknowingly, being celebrated with an early afternoon meal. Few in the village are aware that a year has gone by since Manmohan Singh was appointed Prime Minister on May 22 last year ? but the signs of one successful programme are the number of children in school. 

 A year, they say, is a fleeting moment in politics. In governance, though, 12 months are enough to showcase a bent of mind. The government has not been resting on its achievement of ousting the so-called all-powerful National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government which was cent per cent sure of staging a comeback, says Congress spokesperson Ambika Soni. From day one, we have been committed to the Common Minimum Programme, she says. 

 Centres wishlist

 The Common Minimum Programme (CMP) that the constituents of the UPA government and its allies inked last year, was quite a list. The focus was on rural India, as the document spoke of stepping up public investment in rural infrastructure and irrigation, completing existing irrigation within three to four years, taking immediate steps to lighten debt burdens and interest rates for farmers, focusing on education, with the spending raised to six per cent of the gross domestic product, and funds for poverty alleviation and rural development. 

 The CMP, though, is still a mere wishlist. The much-talked of Rural Employment Guarantee Act, which originally sought to provide employment for at least 100 days a year at minimum wages for at least one person in each rural, urban, poor and lower middle-class household, has been drastically diluted. The food-for-work programme, now said to be in place in 150 districts, is mismanaged and the just-announced rural health mission is still to take off. 

 Theres little to show that life has changed in Bichpuri and in Chauhatana, or in Narayangarh in neighbouring Mathura. The complaints are the age-old grievances of lack of work, health facilities and education. Water is a serious problem in Narayangarh, and the farmers say they worry about the fate of their wheat crop. There is no water for people or for animals, says villager Mihi Lal. Where are the jobs? asks college student Ram Niwas. 

 FOOD FOR THOUGHT: Schools that provide 

 nourishment for children report higher attendance

The villagers have not heard of the Rural Employment Guarantee Act, nor of the food-for-work programme. Officials laud the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan ? a programme that promised to see all children in school by 2003, every child completing four years of primary education by 2007 and eight years of elementary education by 2010 ? but the villagers say that there is little that they see by way of an improved and enhanced school education. The midday meal, they hold, is catching on, but the Dalits complain that often their children are turned away without food in school. 

 But, clearly, if there is one visible sign of change, its in the implementation of the midday meal scheme. Its an old programme that was started in 1995, but one that was being practised erratically or even rarely in states till the Supreme Court stepped in, directing all state governments in 2001 to introduce cooked midday meals in primary schools. Last year, soon after the new UPA government was sworn in, it announced that a national cooked nutritious midday meal scheme funded mainly by the central government will be introduced in primary and secondary schools. 

 Money matters 

 But one working programme is not much to write home about. Development writer P. Sainath rues that there has been little by way of legislative changes to show that the farmer has a place in government policies, unlike the plethora of laws that, he contends, seeks to make life better for the rich. Most of the rural schemes that the government has announced are old ones ? which, Sainath stresses, the government has merely reshuffled, rejigged and rehashed. 

 What is different, however, is the averred focus on rural India, and the fact that the government has earmarked a greater outlay of expenditure on rural schemes. For the food-for-work programme, launched in November 2004, the expenditure in the current year is estimated at Rs 4,020 crore, while the government has earmarked a provision of Rs 5,400 crore for cash and 50 lakh metric tonnes of foodgrain for 2005-06. The allocation for health and family welfare is slated to increase from Rs 8,420 crore this year to Rs 10,280 crore in the coming year. The midday meal scheme expects to cover 11 crore children, for which the allocation will go up from Rs 1,675 crore to Rs 3,010 crore the next year. For Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, the government intends to spend Rs 7,156 crore in 2005 to 2006. 

 Expenditure has been pushed up massively, says economist Abhijit Sen. But it remains to be seen whether the money is being spent, and where it is going. 

 But Agra district magistrate Sanjay Prasad stresses that money is coming in. Things have improved in this one year, he says. A year ago, there was no money in Uttar Pradesh. Now schools and classrooms are being built and teachers are being appointed, he says. 

 The school in Bichpuri is a testimony to the change. New rooms have been erected, and a building has been raised. There is even a computer room ? safely locked up ? where computer teacher Pradeep Kumar says students are taught about health and other issues with the help of compact discs. District education officer Himachal Vashisht stresses that more and more students are staying on in school ? if, for nothing else, the hot meal. The earlier problem of dropping out is no longer an issue, she says . 

 On an average

 The Prime Ministers Office (PMO) in New Delhi is content with the governments first year. Going by the feedback that we have been getting, things are moving as per schedule, says an official in the PMO. 

 Not surprisingly, the text of the Prime Ministers speech to the Congress Working Committee earlier this week gave the government first-division marks ? a six out of 10 ? at the end of the first year. 

 Sainath believes that it well may be a fact. But I have figured out that the Prime Minister sat for two papers ?one for the urban rich, and one for the rural poor. In the first paper, he got a 10 out of 10, and in the second, two out of 10. And that averages out to a six out of 10.

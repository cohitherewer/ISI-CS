 RESCUE OPERATION

 Passage through India

A Raj Collection 

Edited by Swaras Cowasjee, 

Oxford, Rs 595

After exhaustive theorizations on Indian English literature 

and Indian literature in English translation, it appears that attention has now 

turned to another genre of Indian literature ? Anglo-Indian literature or raj 

literature. The term ?Anglo-Indian? has a specific connotation among the literati. 

It is used to denote literature written by the British who lived in India during 

the raj. 

 Owing to its bias against Indians, colonial approach and a general poor quality of writing, this genre has for years suffered neglect. Only a handful, such as Kipling?s Kim and Forster?s Passage to India, have been able to simulate interest. The rest have been long out of circulation. However, the Eighties saw a resurgence of interest. Several of the old texts were exhumed and reprinted. This collection of four novels is part of that endeavour. Swaras Cowasjee has long researched on raj fiction and has already published three volumes of raj stories.

 What is striking in this book is that it breaks free from the publication assembly line of Forster and Kipling and presents lost voices. There is also a common thread running through the four novels ? the 1857 mutiny. The four novels give a British perspective of the events and can serve as useful material for anthropological and political analyses. Besides, they are of considerable literary merit.

 The four novels included in this selection are ? On the Face of Waters (1896) by Flora Annie Steel, Siri Ram-Revolutionist (1912) by Edmund Candler, Indigo (1943) by Christine Weston, and Wild Sweet Witch (1947) by Philip Mason. 

 The first is set in Delhi during the Mutiny and takes off from Kipling?s fiction, underscoring and reaffirming the ?white man?s burden? to civilize the barbarians. Siri Ram-Revolutionist shows the revolutionaries as cowards, self-serving people. Khudiram?s killing of two women by mistake is portrayed as a deliberate and dark act. However, Candler in a later novel, Abdication, acknowledges that the nationalists were a force to reckon with. 

 Indigo looks at the relationship between three boys of different ethnicities ? French, British and Hindu. The three drift apart, the Hindu boy becomes a revolutionary, the British a staunch supporter of the raj, and the French a passive third person point-of-view. Forster?s contention that friendships cannot transcend politics is reiterated. 

 Wild Sweet Witch spans three generations of a family. The university-educated grandson is enthused by Western ideas and joins the anti-imperial struggle. But his war is not that simple, and he is consumed by his conflicts within. The symbolism for the divided self ? later evoked through Partition ? is quite apparent. 

 The collection includes two women novelists, their fiction providing a counterpoint to the masculine fiction of Kipling. The Forster school of writing was a different canon that had its own offspring. The book is a delight. One would hope that it doesn?t end up on the post-colonial shelf for another set of fancy theorizations.

 NEW WARMTH

 The new warmth in India?s relations with Japan reflects the changing geopolitics of the Asia-Pacific region. The recent visit of the Japanese prime minister, Mr Junichiro Koizumi, to New Delhi clearly demonstrated that Tokyo views India as a potentially important ally in an uncertain international order. Japan?s tense relations with China provide an additional motivation for building ties with India. For New Delhi, a sustained engagement with Japan seems to be part of a policy to build close ties with all the major powers to strengthen its presence in the region. Stronger relations should also help to establish India as a major player in the Asia-Pacific region, and in the larger international system. Mr Koizumi?s visit seems to have put many of the bilateral irritants on the back-burner. For instance, there was no preaching from Japan on the nuclear issue. Instead, India and Japan pledged to work as ?partners against nuclear proliferation?. 

 Similarly, Japan now sees New Delhi as an important partner, regionally and globally. No longer is India considered an inconsequential third-world country. Indeed, the joint statement of the two prime ministers and the eight-fold initiative that was launched, bring this out explicitly. India and Japan now believe that their ?global partnership? reflects a ?broad convergence of their long-term, political, economic and strategic interests, aspirations, objectives and concerns?. In this context, Japan has strongly supported India?s participation in the East Asian Summit in Malaysia towards the end of the year. More significantly, apart from holding a high-level strategic dialogue at the official level, Japan wants greater cooperation with India in the security arena. The Indian coast guard and the Japan coast guard will initiate efforts to establish a framework for effective cooperation. And the Indian navy and the self-defence force of Japan will strengthen their cooperation. India and Japan have also agreed to launch an oil and natural gas cooperation dialogue between their petroleum ministries. India and Japan have a common interest in an expanded security council and even discussed expanding the ?G-4? grouping of contenders for a permanent seat in the United Nations security council to include at least two African countries. Bilateral relations, after the Japanese prime minister?s visit, are set to touch a new zenith of cooperation.

 ANOTHER COURT

 How reasonable is ?reasonable?? Left parties have turned to the prime minister with an appeal for social justice, which appears to politicians to be threatened now by the Supreme Court?s ruling that private unaided colleges need not reserve seats for scheduled caste and scheduled tribe groups. In response, the prime minister has reportedly suggested that the government could formulate a bill to broaden the scope of ?reasonable restrictions? mentioned in Article 19 of the Constitution. This would be the best route for a proposed amendment, because the Constitution is quite clear on the conditions under which restrictions can be imposed on the freedom enshrined in Article 19 (g) to ?practise any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business?. To impose a restriction on unaided educational institutions to make them fall in line with the government?s ?philosophy?, as has been suggested by the Union minister for human resource development, Mr Arjun Singh, does not seem to have been a constitutional goal. The spirit enshrined in the Constitution is that of democracy, which envisions, in some areas at least, a measure of autonomy for the states. Education is on the concurrent list, and reasonableness may look different from different locations.

 There is a private professional educational institution bill too, intended to be quietly regulatory, fixing ?parameters? for fee structures and so on. This could be used to impose the quota philosophy. Whoever wins in the end, the overwhelming concern of all political parties about the implied denial of social justice cannot fail to be amusing. The Lok Sabha is bursting at the seams with leaders who have come in purely on the strength of their caste-defined constituencies. They cannot risk suspicion. And the left, typically, are far more worried about reserved seats in private institutions than about people dying of starvation in West Bengal. Politicians, irrespective of party, know of only one kind of social justice, the one that gives them plenty in return.

 TO KNOW IS TO BE FREE

 Recent reports that prisoners are being kept without being charged and without counsel at the American military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, have brought into focus the role of media in the protection of human rights. A Newsweek report in June on the alleged desecration of the Quran at Guantanamo led to widespread unrest in the Islamic world. Although the magazine later retracted its story after it was blamed by the Bush administration for the heat generated and the embarrassment caused to the government, the debate on the question has not been laid to rest.

 While the concept of human rights is quite old, there are instances galore of their being violated. Not surprisingly, many organizations were set up and movements launched in defence of these rights. On December 10, 1948, the United Nations general assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as an enduring global commitment. Its historical significance needs no stressing. The goal was, and still is, to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms of all, without distinction of race, sex, language and religion.

 Good intentions 

 The Universal Declaration of 1948 has since been supplemented by an array of texts. There are also over 50 international treaties representing the practical extension of the principles set forth in the declarations. But human-rights violations still abound. 

 The emphasis on human rights is essentially meant to achieve a reordering of politics at the national and international levels. In the ongoing battle against injustice, persecution, genocide, torture and other forms of inhumanity, the media has an important role. The media can foster a greater awareness of the rights people are entitled to but may be denied. But first they should ensure that people enjoy the right to know what their rights are. A second major duty is to expose and denounce violations of human rights, and by doing so, to create opinion favourable to the sufferers. 

 Human-rights bodies and activists well know the utility of the media for the success of their cause. The victims of human-rights violations also often use the media to influence public opinion at home and abroad. The media also act as a check on the arbitrary exercise of power. 

 Risk factor

 It is not difficult to imagine the magnitude of the risks mediamen must undertake while discharging their responsibilities. For example, attacks on Philippine journalists last year left 13 dead and this year, five. Such are the dangers that Filipino journalists are thinking of arming themselves for their safety. But is it not the responsibility of the government to protect journalists?

 Of course, the ability of the media to fulfil the expectations depends on the degree of freedom enjoyed. ?A free press may be good or bad, but a press without freedom can only be bad?, said Albert Camus. But while a certain degree of freedom is required for the media to act as watchdog, there are obligations too that they cannot shirk. A degree of self-restraint must be exercised so that the freedom is not abused. 

 Given our dependence on Western news agencies and the inroads made into state sovereignty by the international media, efforts should be made to reduce the harmful effects of biased reports and analyses. The media should be careful not to give sensational treatment to an isolated incident ? a crime, a violent clash between persons of different ethnic or religious groups, the influx of immigrants ? in a way that would lead to resentment or prejudice. The media also must resist being used by individuals or groups whose demands or claims are not justified.

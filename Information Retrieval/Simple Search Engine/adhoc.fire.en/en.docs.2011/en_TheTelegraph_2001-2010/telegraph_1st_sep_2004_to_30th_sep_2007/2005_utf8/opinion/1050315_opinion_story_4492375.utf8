 FULLY IMMUNIZED AND AWARE

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from a study on the response of the tribal communities of Jharia coalfield to the pulse polio immunization programme

 The data collected indicates that there is significant gender bias in immunization in non-tribal villages, but such gender bias is not significant in tribal villages.

 The father?s literacy or level of education was found not to have significant influence on immunization status of his wards. The percentage of literacy or ?mean year of schooling of guardians?, which was taken as an objective parameter of education level of a village, did not have significant correlation with status of immunization index formulated during the study.

 Very frequently, it was noted that a village with relatively good education level has a poor record of immunization, and vice versa. It means that there are factors like intensity of polio immunization drive and existence of health centres nearby which influence the status of polio immunization in a locality.

 ...There is low awareness about the polio immunization programme among all sections of villagers though anti-immunization feelings were not encountered from any section during the study.

 Publicity and public relations campaigns conducted through television, radio and newspapers reached only a small section of the villagers. The information regarding the PPI programme was mostly received through word of mouth. Nearly 53 per cent of the households received the information from health workers and volunteers. Twenty-two per cent claimed to receive the information from friends and neighbours who again must have received it from health workers or media advertisements. 

 Moreover, the villagers ...only get information in bits and pieces, about dates, venues and time of the programme, but not about the requirement for making a child fully immunized.

 Innovative means of conveying the message of polio immunization to the villagers should be considered... The complete information regarding the programme should be conveyed in a way that the villagers are motivated to be active participants in it.

 It has not, however, been possible to establish a relationship between polio vaccination coverage and rate of incidence of polio in the district because of non-availability of the data.

 Wastage of polio vials due to lack of cold chain maintenance has not been reported from the district.

 The erratic power supply in the district poses problems in cold chain maintenance, but with diesel generating sets being made available in district stores (for vaccines) and primary health centres, the problem has been mitigated. The delayed sanction of funds for purchase of diesel sometimes poses minor problem.

 Recommendations: Efforts should be made to popularize routine polio immunization programme and proper record of such immunization should be kept in the health centres.

 A larger number of PPI programmes should be held in the year and spread over a longer period. 

 The publicity campaign for polio-immunization should focus both on PPI and RPI programmes. To make the RPI programme more attractive to villagers, a block-level scheme of awarding prizes through lottery may be considered.

 Scientific assessment of polio immunization coverage should be done in every district regularly just before the start of the PPI programme. This would help the district administration and WHO surveillance officers to identify the areas with weak immunization coverage. This survey should preferably be done by organizations and experts not involved in the polio immunization drive.

 CHANGE OF GUARD

 Exits are never easy. Some people do it better than others but only a consummate actor leaves the stage with his exit lines uttered to perfection. Sourav Ganguly has made a dog?s breakfast of his exit from the captaincy of the Indian cricket team and perhaps even from the team. He could have done it better had he not allowed his ego to get the better of his common sense. It has been clear to all, save Ganguly?s loyal fan following in Calcutta, that his batting prowess has been on a sharp decline. His timing, once superb, had gone awry; his footwork, never very good, had become non-existent; his technique outside the off stump, always suspect, had made him a rabbit of good fast bowlers; his running between the wickets, invariably selfish, had reached levels to make a novice blush. His last test innings against Zimbabwe, a few weeks ago, showed a Ganguly who was less than a shadow of his former self. This decline took its toll on his captaincy. He was no longer leading from the front. The old aggression had evaporated. He knew he was no longer pulling his weight in the team as a player. Any other player would have stepped aside and taken time off from top class cricket to get back to the nets and the fundamentals. Ganguly did the exact opposite and decided not to play cricket. He chose to have a head-on collision with the coach, Greg Chappell. He got himself involved in a squabble which could never be resolved in his favour given his poor batting form. Ironically, he chose to fight with the one man who could have actually helped him to improve his batting. The result is a somewhat forced exit under the cover of an injury.

 Things need not have come to such a pathetic conclusion. Ganguly has an impressive record as India?s captain. Apart from the successes he has registered, there is another remarkable achievement that he can lay claim to with ample justification. Other than Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi many moons ago, Ganguly is the only skipper who rose above provincial and zonal interests. The country came first to him. In the world of Indian cricket, this is no mean achievement. Greater cricketers than Ganguly promoted players from the states and the zones to which they belonged. This has been the story of Indian cricket ever since India started playing cricket at the international level. Ganguly, like Pataudi, broke from it and for a short period under him, the Indian team appeared to play as one unit. This attitude of Ganguly was necessary since he came to captain the side a short time after the shenanigans of Mohammed Azharuddin. This is Ganguly?s most important contribution to Indian cricket, and this has earned him the gratitude of all lovers of Indian cricket.

 It remains to be seen what the new captain, Rahul Dravid, does with this legacy. His task is by no means easy since the morale and the performance of the team are both very low. The Board of Control for Cricket in India should help him by clarifying the role of the captain and the role of the coach. There should be no scope for confusion on this score.

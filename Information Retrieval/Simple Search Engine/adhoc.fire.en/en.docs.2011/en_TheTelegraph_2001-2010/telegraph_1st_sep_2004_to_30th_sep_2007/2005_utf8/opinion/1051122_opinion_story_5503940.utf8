 OLD GOLD

 Gold prices have been scaling new heights almost every day in the domestic market, while it has reached an 18-year high in the international markets. Almost a century after John Maynard Keynes called it a ?barbarous relic?, gold seems to have lost none of its lustre. True, domestic gold prices have undoubtedly been helped by the forthcoming wedding season, and by the weakening of the rupee against the dollar. But that doesn?t explain the rise in gold prices internationally. During the last two years, gold has rallied while the US dollar has fallen, and the explanation was that investment in gold formed a hedge against a depreciating dollar. This year, however, the dollar has rallied against all major currencies, but that hasn?t prevented the yellow metal from reaching new highs. What is fuelling demand? Data from the World Gold Council show that while total demand for gold rose by 18 per cent in dollar terms, most of the incremental demand has come from those who hold gold as an investment. Investment demand rose by as much as 56 per cent in the third quarter of the current year, compared to the same quarter last year. Unsurprisingly, the rise in demand for gold jewellery has been much more muted, thanks to the sharp rise in price. In India, total demand this year is 37 per cent higher than 2004 levels in tonnage terms and 42 per cent in rupee terms.

 The strength of demand is so strong that prices have risen in spite of gold supply in the third quarter being around a fifth higher than the level a year ago. Part of the reason is the increasing number of gold funds that have popularized gold as an investment. Liquidity and the phenomenal growth of hedge funds that invest in a range of asset classes have also played a part. Also important is the high level of imbalances in the global economy, such as the record US current account deficit and its counterpart, the investment binge in China, or the housing bubble in the United States of America. Concerns over how these will unravel, as well as worries over higher inflation, increase the allure of a traditional safe haven like gold. Central bank sales too have been lower, while some of them have said that they intend to add to their gold reserves. And finally, as countries like India and China grow their disposable incomes rapidly, demand for jewellery is likely to rise sharply. These trends, taken together with the difficulty of increasing output from mines, have made gold an increasingly important asset in diversified portfolios.

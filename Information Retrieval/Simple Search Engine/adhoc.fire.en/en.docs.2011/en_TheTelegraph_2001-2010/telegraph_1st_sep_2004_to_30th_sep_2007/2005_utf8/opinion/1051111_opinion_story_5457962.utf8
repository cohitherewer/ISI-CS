 MORE SECRETS

 - Bomb?s father was a bundle of nerves

 Nagasaki, August 9, 1945

 Shockwave: The Countdown to Hiroshima By Stephen Walker, John Murray, ? 20

 Isn?t history a queer treasure trove, which increases its bounty in each retelling? Anyone going through Stephen Walker?s graphic reconstruction of the birth of atomic age cannot escape that conclusion. Humankind?s obsession with the destructive power lurking within an atom is now six decades old, but that seems to have had no effect whatsoever on its charm. In fact, the 60th anniversary of unleashing that fury has provided many with a fresh excuse to delve deeper into the act that its chief proponent, Hungarian physicist Leo Szilard, later described as ?one of the greatest blunders of history.?

 The birth centenary of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atom bomb, last year saw the publication of two books on him ? Oppenheimer: Portrait of an Enigma (by Jeremy Bernstein) and J. Robert Oppenheimer and the American Century (David Cassidy). History-digging continues with three more titles this year ? American Prometheus (Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin), 109 East Palace (Jennet Conant) and The Ruin of J. Robert Oppenheimer (Priscilla McMillan). Dr Atomic, an opera based on the rise and fall of this enigmatic character, but essentially capturing humanity?s flirtation with the doomsday weapon, is also running to rave reviews in San Fransisco now. Diana Preston?s Before the Fallout: From Marie Curie to Hiroshima, published this year, covers almost the same ground as Richard Rhodes?s The Making of the Atomic Bomb, for which he bagged a Pulitzer Prize in 1986.

 Shockwave is different from all these. A student of history at Oxford and history of science at Harvard, and winner of an Emmy award for his BBC documentary on the bombing of Hiroshima, Walker has opted for a narrower span of events with a view to probing their deeper layers more closely than ever before. He has chronicled the dramatic turn of events during only 25 days 60 years ago ? from the storm-lashed night of July 15 when Oppenheimer and his men frantically waited in the New Mexico desert to see if the bomb made by them would really go off to the clear midday of August 9 when some 70,000 unwary people in Nagasaki were scorched to death at one go.

 This description of Walker?s book may remind its prospective readers of Pulitzer prizewinning author John Hersey?s Hiroshima, published in 1946. First featured as a 30,000-word essay covering an entire issue of New Yorker, this account put a human face on the consequences of atom bombs, highlighting the tales of their survivors in the two Japanese cities. Which is why the book left a far deeper scar on American psyche than the earlier news accounts and articles on the science and efforts leading to the bombs, or mere statistics of casualties. Shockwave is in the same genre as Hiroshima, but it covers a wider ground. Through his riveting reportage of 25 crucial days of the 20th century, Walker tries to read the mind of the men who shaped its history.

 The broad outlines of the story are much too well-known to surprise any reader. For example, that physicist Enrico Fermi, one of the architects of the bomb, predicted ? and even took bets on ? the possibility that the test blast would set the world?s atmosphere ablaze, and destroy the entire planet, is no revelation now. It is also common knowledge that the two bombs dropped on Japan were more to intimidate Joseph Stalin?s Russia than to cut short World War II and thus the death toll of US soldiers. But Walker has overcome this handicap of coming late to the parade through sheer narrative style. He has culled together a huge amount of archival material and deftly mixed cinematic jump-cuts of events in the lives of the Manhattan Project scientists, Japanese soldiers and civilians, US servicemen, and heads of state like Winston Churchill, Harry Truman, Stalin and Emperor Hirohito to take readers on a roller-coaster ride through the last days of World War II.

 Especially gripping is Walker?s reportage of the proceedings in Potsdam, Germany, where Truman, Churchill and Stalin met to decide the fate of Japan. Walker describes a queer ball game in progress there. Conventional bombings of Japanese cities had put the government in Tokyo on the brink of an abject defeat, and Churchill and Truman wanted it to agree to unconditional surrender. However, Hirohito?s men, in a bid to save face, were sending frantic secret messages to Moscow so that Stalin broker a peace agreement. But neither Hirohito nor Stalin knew that, thanks to the decoding skills of US scientists, Truman and Churchill had full knowledge of those cables. Similarly, both of them were under the illusion that the successful blast of the first atom bomb, an ace up their sleeves, was unknown to Stalin. His most precious spy in the Manhattan Project, Klaus Fuchs, had been present during the blast.

 Walker has cited two curious twists of irony: the inventor of the radar technology used to detonate the bomb in midair over Hiroshima was a Japanese scientist; and the bomb on Nagasaki went off almost directly overhead the Mitsubishi armament factories that had produced the torpedoes used in the attack on Pearl Harbour. Also, not many know that Kokura, not Nagasaki, was the target of the second atom bomb, and the cover of a thick cloud over that city saved it from doom on August 9, 1945. 

 Interestingly, the longest description of a single event in Shockwave ? the test blast of the atom bomb in the New Mexico desert ? doesn?t include a legendary ingredient: Oppenheimer?s reported chanting of a sloka from the Bhagavad Gita ? Kaalohosmi lokokshoyot probriddho, lokaan somaahortumiha probritto (?I?m become death, destroyer of worlds?). Walker?s Oppenheimer was too much of a bundle of nerves to be a poet on that momentous occasion.

 MORE CHILD?S PLAY

 MALVIKA SINGH

 Delhi has been brimming over with strange happenings this last week. The chant from a rather broken down BJP has been, ?Chidambaram must go.? Why? Because his wife indulged in some unthinking impropriety? It appeared as though the only critical problem plaguing India was that one issue. Why doesn?t the BJP fight for Indian women to have 50 per cent equality with men in politics for a start? Why is the single largest national opposition party fiddling about on the Chidambaram family issue? Did the UPA scream blue murder about the unending familial shenanigans of the NDA? Indians are no fools. They know well that politicians of all hues are pretty much the same when it comes to ethics and values. People want the delivery of goods and services, not holier-than-thou platitudes. The opposition needs to be a trifle more serious.

 Led by the Delhi arm of the Congress, the grand old party devoted its energy this week to assaulting Sheila Dikshit with all its might. A ?rollback? was announced. Why are we forever rolling back...will we ever roll forward? Can we never admit the wrongs and attempt solutions that may rectify errors? Is rollback the only answer to failures? Now, the ten per cent cut will be imposed indirectly, not directly, on the consumer for the same third-rate service of this utility ? power. Government subsidies do not fall like manna from the heavens...surely the public understands that. Does Congressman Ram Babu Sharma comprehend that? Or is he playing out a populist ploy? 

 Due discredit

 Rather than be constantly humiliated by her own party people, Sheila Dikshit should accept defeat and hand the power sector in Delhi over to Ram Babu, the loudest dissenting voice. That will fix his political position in Delhi once and for all. He will be discredited for the next five years at least, if not for always. Ashok Gehlot, the CM who let Rajasthan slip away from the Congress despite many early warnings, is now bringing his inept political manipulations into prominence in the capital. He has diluted the party during his tenure as the general secretary in charge of Delhi. Sheila Dikshit has made it twice. Chances are that the Congress will lose the next elections regardless of the ?rollback?. Good luck to Gehlot and Ram Babu.

 And as Gehlot fiddles in Delhi, believing he is close to the power hierarchy as its primary representative, Vasundhara Raje has once again shown her paces. She has swept the panchayat polls, decimating the Gehlot Congress. Why is Gehlot not out there, in the field with temperatures soaring to 100 plus degrees, resurrecting the fortunes of the party that he let down? Rajasthan was always seen as a Congress stronghold. Gehlot seems to have thrown in the sponge and settled for a ?job? at 24 Akbar Road in Delhi. It is this lack of political commitment and an inability to take on the challenges in the political space that has discredited the Congress. It has lost much ground and refuses to see it, riding high on an aberration of a victory that it tasted a year and some months ago.

 From the early reports that are filtering into the capital, it appears that Nitish and his party are ahead in the race in Bihar. If true, what will a wipe-out of the Congress in Bihar mean for the party at large? What is the story in Maharashtra, Andhra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu? What is the scene for the Congress in West Bengal and Kerala? Where are the potential victories? Where are the numbers? The ?report card? leaves much to be desired. Mayavati is relentlessly following her agenda, adjusting her strategy as she moves ahead, and she will, most certainly gain ground. South of the Vindhyas Jayalalithaa too, is determined to win her election and all the probables are in her favour. It is the ?national parties? that seem to have lost the political plot.

 UNCLEAR VERDICT

 Indian voters never cease to spring surprises. In Jharkhand, the people turned two pre-poll predictions on their heads. It was generally agreed before the polls that the fractures within the ruling National Democratic Alliance had put it at a distinct disadvantage vis-?-vis the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance. The Bharatiya Janata Party itself was a divided house, as was evident in the replacement of Mr Babulal Marandi by Mr Arjun Munda as chief minister. The UPA hopes, on the other hand, were riding high. And that made many to project Mr Shibu Soren of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha as the state?s next chief minister. The results have not only put the NDA ahead of the UPA but have also exposed the erosion in Mr Soren?s popularity. His two sons and brother were defeated and his party fared badly in its stronghold of the Santhal Parganas. It may not be just the corruption charges against him that have tipped the scale against Mr Soren. As in neighbouring Bihar, the UPA?s unity was dented on the eve of the elections with the result that the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the left parties moved away from the Congress-JMM alliance. Even if the NDA fails to get a simple majority, the BJP leadership can legitimately claim a large measure of success for managing the frictions within the party and among the NDA partners. 

 However, the unclear verdict throws up two major concerns. Large parts of the state are virtually besieged by Maoist rebels who cynically exploit the region?s endemic poverty. Rapid economic growth, therefore, has to be the focus of any new government in Ranchi. It is possible that the rebels would try to exploit a political vacuum in order to extend their areas of influence. The other concern relates to the controversial domicile issue that has caused deep divisions between the tribal and the non-tribal sections of the people. The NDA regime failed to resolve the issue, thereby fuelling the debate as to who should be considered original settlers in the state. All this is related to the benefits that the original settlers are supposed to get from the state. Much of the state?s politics in the past four years has revolved around this question of ethnicity. Whichever alliance eventually forms the government has to urgently deal with these two problems. But the worry is that the politicians may now be too anxious to stay in power to bother about governance.

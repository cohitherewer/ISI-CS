 THREE?S A CROWD

 It always helps to listen to those who know. If an organization has an expertise in resolving or managing conflicts, its counsel could be useful to peacemakers. It is another matter, though, to directly involve such an organization in peace negotiations between two sides. New Delhi should thus have no problem with any proposals that a Dutch non-profit organization, Kreddha, may put forward for the Naga peace talks. Given the group?s previous records in conflict resolutions in East Timor and in Tibet, its proposals may merit an honest scrutiny by both New Delhi and the Nagas. Both sides may then take their positions on what to do with the proposals. But all this need not mean a third-party mediation in the talks. The National Socialist Council of Nagalim, led by Mr Isak Chishi Swu and Mr Thuingaleng Muivah, has long demanded that the peace talks be held in a ?third? country ? that is, outside India. After initial hesitations, New Delhi has been realistic enough to agree to the demand. The Naga demand was inspired by the NSCN?s idea of ?sovereignty? for the Naga people. But allowing a third party to enter into the dialogue may complicate the peace process more than help it. Such a course can open a Pandora?s box with other militant groups asking for mediations by foreign groups or powers. Mr Muivah should know the practical problems of involving a third party in the Naga talks.

 However, New Delhi has to take Mr Muivah?s complaints about the peace process more seriously. The Naga conflict, which dates back to 1947, has defied earlier attempts at resolution. But the current ceasefire and the talks have created a sense of mutual trust that has been elusive since the Shillong Accord of 1975. If Mr Muivah is sceptical about New Delhi?s intentions, the latter should do more in order to set his doubts at rest. The slow progress of the talks may not be because of a lack of sincerity on the Centre?s part. Even Mr Muivah cannot be unaware of New Delhi?s compulsions in some of his demands. The demand for the integration of Naga-inhabited areas is one of these. While this is crucial for Mr Muivah?s scheme of things, it is a political minefield for the Centre. For it will involve the redrawing of the boundaries of several northeastern states. There would be other hurdles on the way; the important thing is not to let the peace process collapse. The blame game is no way to save it.

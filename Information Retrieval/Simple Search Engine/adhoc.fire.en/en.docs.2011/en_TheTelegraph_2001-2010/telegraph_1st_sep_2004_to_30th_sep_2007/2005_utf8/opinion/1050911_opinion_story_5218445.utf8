 DEAD ENTREPRENEURS

 Goals and visions are necessarily expressed in the future tense. And disempowerment is about never being able to bring the future within the realm of the possible. In India, this is most starkly experienced in the sphere of education ? primary, secondary, higher as well as vocational. What did the notion of a ?future? come to mean for Sasanka Ghosh ? a class-XII student in Kalyani, West Bengal ? when he chose to end his life on Wednesday? He did this perhaps out of a combination of hurt and hopelessness when his father, a tailor, could not manage to provide Sasanka with the money for his computer classes, and also slapped him for insisting on having it. (His father pays for his two daughters? university education as well.) The tragedy of Sasanka?s death acquires another dimension when his headmaster reveals that his school was not aware of Sasanka?s poverty, and hence did not inform the boy about his entitlement to the government?s fee-waiver scheme for students from low-income families. Thus the impediments are not only economic, but also systemic, making the access to what is available tragically beyond reach. And the worst affected are underprivileged students who have benefited from the state?s primary and secondary schools, but are then left to perish on the threshold of the competitive higher education ?free market?. After clearing the higher secondary and joint entrance examinations, the world of doctors, engineers and IT-professionals suddenly confronts them with its portals cruelly shut.

 It is also significant that Sasanka ended his life in West Bengal. This is the state where over a crore are still illiterate. Its chief minister?s public statements on international literacy day ? in the future tense, of course ? invoked the figure of the ?efficient entrepreneur? saved from the exclusion from higher education by the ?development of vocational education?. Sasanka?s ?failure? had been precisely in becoming such an entrepreneur. The future tense was also much in use, on the same occasion, in Delhi when the Centre suddenly made public its enlargement of vision regarding universal education: universal primary education is not enough, and the government must make ready its plans for universalizing secondary education as well. India, it ought to be recalled at this stage, is quite hopelessly behind schedule with the Millennium Development Goals in primary education, and West Bengal?s contribution to this falling-behind must be considerable. The Human Development Report 2005 shows how children, especially girls, are the victims of this backwardness. Sasanka?s suicide seems far away from the actuality of infant mortality rates and gender inequality. But a holistic look at India?s crisis in education, and one that does not resist thinking through the unjust consequences of privatization, might help to make a few connections among them.

 TO BE REDEEMED FROM TIME

 Return to hell

WITHOUT BLOOD

By Alessandro Baricco, 

Canongate, pound; 4.00

This is a heart-rending novella rendered unforgettable 

by the author?s inimitable minimalist prose. There is not an extra word and not 

a word out of place. 

 It is a tale of redemption that begins with a shocking scene of violence. A gang enters a farmer?s house, and kills him and his small son. It is an act of revenge for a crime committed in the past. The farmer?s four-year-old daughter, Nina, survives because of an act of mercy on the part of Tito, the youngest of the killers. Nina?s father had hidden her under a trapdoor. The young killer had discovered her there and had left her there without telling his mates. She survived not only the massacre but also the fire, as the killers had set the house on fire before they left the scene of violence.

 Many decades later, Nina and Tito meet again in a town where Tito, now an old man, sells lottery tickets from a kiosk. She buys a ticket from him and persuades him to have a drink with her. Tito had recognized Nina, and in the bar, he tells her, ?Many years ago, you saw three men kill your father, in cold blood. I?m the only one of the three who?s still alive. You came here to find me. Now you?ve found me.?? Tito falls silent because he has no more to say.

 Nina tells Tito about her life after she survived the fire and the killing. Tito thinks she speaks in a strange way: ?as if it were a gesture that she wasn?t used to.? The girl speaks about her past nostalgically but without melancholy. She asks Tito if he remembers the killing. ?The man said that he remembered. That he had done nothing else, for years, but remember everything.?? Then he speaks about his life, his feelings, his fears. He claims his memory to be his redemption: ?I have carried this secret inside me for my whole life like a disease. I deserve to be sitting here, with you.?

 From the caf?, they move to a hotel at the woman?s invitation. They make love: ?...she turned, moved closer...and did what she had lived for?Then she thought that however incomprehensible life is, probably we move through it with the single desire to return to the hell that created us, to live beside whoever, once, saved us from the inferno. She tried to ask herself where that absurd faithfulness to horror came from but found that she had no answers. She understood only that nothing is stronger than the instinct to return, to where they broke us, and to replicate that moment forever. Only thinking that the one who saved us once can do it forever. In a long hell identical to the one from which we came. But suddenly merciful. And without blood. The sign outside told its rosary of red lights. They were like the flames of a house on fire.?? 

 What else can one do but salute an author who can write like that?

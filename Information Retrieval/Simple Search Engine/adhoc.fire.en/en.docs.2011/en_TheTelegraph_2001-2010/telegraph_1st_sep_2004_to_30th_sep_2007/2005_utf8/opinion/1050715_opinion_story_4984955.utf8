 TECHNOLOGY IS THE EDITOR?S BEST FRIEND

 Learning new tricks

If you have visited the production/arts departments of publishing houses in the Nineties and revisit them now, you would find that enormous changes have taken place in production techniques because of the widespread introduction of Apple Macintosh computers. No longer is the design and layout handed out to designers, who work on how best to package a book for the market. Now, with page layout programmes, readily available fonts and a ?graphic user interface? in one convenient package, the whole exercise is done in-house.

 Cover designers have benefited enormously with programmes like QuarkXpress, Freehand and Illustrator, and image-manipulation software like Photoshop. The ability to preview designs, with typography and imagery combined on-screen, has made it possible to try out multiple solutions quickly, and, if necessary, for discussions to take place around the computer. The merging of creative and production roles has made it possible for a greater dialogue to take place between editors, picture researchers and designers. 

 And this has implications for the new breed of editors and production managers who are entering the profession. It is not enough for editors to be well-informed across a range of subjects or have a keen eye for language and syntax, but also to be reasonably comfortable with computer applications on Word. This is because more and more manuscripts are submitted on floppies or CDs, editing is done on-screen and almost all correspondence by e-mail. Storage and retrieval of data is also handled on the computer. It is indeed a paperless world. So, not to be familiar with the computer is a disqualification that no amount of scholarship can substitute.

 For production managers, familiarity with software and its applications is as essential a qualification as knowledge of printing machines, quality of paper and its suitability for different requirements, binding techniques and so on. Cost-consciousness has become a mantra for production and there is no better place to cut costs than to do the preliminary work in-house before sending the floppy to the printer to finish the job.

 What has made computer knowhow an indispensable requirement is the convergence of the roles of editors and production managers. All successful publishing is the result of teamwork: authors need good editors, and editors need good production managers to convert the manuscript into a user-friendly and visually attractive book that would seduce the potential buyer.

 And this is where designers come in. Designs can now be created by the dozen, manipulated on the screen and the final decision can be taken by the editor-production on the spot. No running around, and hence no delays.

 With covers being given a very high priority now, picture research becomes vitally important. Designers have to rely on search engines to track down what is available in the art galleries and then request for slides to choose from. Without access to the Internet, these acquisitions, expensive as they are, would be impossible.

 The message to editors and production managers is loud and clear: Learn computer applications or perish.

 THE LITTLE MASTER AT A CROSSROADS

 SHOT IN THE DARK

 Cricket-lovers would rather have Tendulkar belting the bowlers than see him play for records

 Even a few years back, Sachin Tendulkar?s birthday was an important date on the national calendar. Television channels would scurry for exclusive interviews of the birthday boy, mothers would make a beeline for temples to pray for the country?s favourite son, and Tendulkar fan clubs would organize festivities that would carry on into the night. This year though, the celebrations have been rather muted, almost as quiet as Tendulkar?s bat. Can the waning of the adulation be attributed to Tendulkar?s indifferent form of late, or have cricket-lovers switched allegiance to the younger and more dashing Virender Sehwag?

 The answer does not lie in numbers though. At 32, after 16 long years in international cricket, Tendulkar?s batting average in tests remains an outstanding 57.25. In one-dayers, it is in the forties. And the possibility of Sehwag upstaging Tendulkar in the future, either in terms of popularity or class, is remote. A Sehwag century gladdens hearts alright, but a Tendulkar hundred still touches a deeper chord in most Indians.

 Perhaps, the disenchantment with Tendulkar has to do with his changed approach to batting. The cavalier, marauding Tendulkar of the past has now been replaced by, what the Wisden Cricketers? Almanac has called, a ?cold?, ?robotic? batsman. The swashbuckling knocks against Australia at Sharjah, or Pakistan in the last world cup, are an aberration to the now familiar sight of a scratching, plodding Tendulkar in the middle. And this has had repercussions on his fans as well as on the game.

 Cricket is a spectator sport in which the role of a spectator is integral to the history and the survival of the game. In the subcontinent, people often paid an enormous sum to watch the old Tendulkar bat, which was an intensely personal experience. It not only left an expert satisfied, but it also made ordinary Indians forget their drudgery.

 One can understand the logic that some players, including former greats, have put forward in defence of Tendulkar?s new approach; at his age, and after contributing so much to the game, he can afford to play for personal milestones, and in a manner he deems fit. There have been many great players in cricket. But very few have gone on to become a legend. Tendulkar is close to becoming one and cold reasoning dictates that it would be best for him to utilize the remaining years to strengthen his claim to immortality.

 But the responsibilities of great players are markedly different from ordinary ones. Tendulkar, being no ordinary cricketer, cannot disown his accountability to cricket and to its followers. Over the last few years, a defensive Tendulkar has made runs, but the game has been the poorer for it. And cricket-lovers would rather have Tendulkar dictate terms to bowlers, than see him play for records. If he loses a few runs in the process, so be it. Perhaps, there is a case in Tendulkar looking at the career of Vivian Richards. The West Indian great may not be the highest run-getter in test cricket. But few would be willing to forget the manner in which he got them.

 Tendulkar is now at a crossroads. One path leads to immortality in the books of record. The other would help him gain a place in the hearts of cricket-lovers forever. But it is the Little Master who must decide which path to tread. And that, in turn, would determine whether his next birthday is a more boisterous affair.

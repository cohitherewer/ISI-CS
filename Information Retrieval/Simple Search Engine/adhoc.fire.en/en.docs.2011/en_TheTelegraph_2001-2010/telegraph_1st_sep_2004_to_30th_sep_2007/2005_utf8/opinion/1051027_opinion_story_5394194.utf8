 TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN

 The CPI(M) has found it difficult to ?discipline? Subhas Chakraborty since he is supported by the less ideologically-driven cadre, writes Sumanta Sen

 Strongarm tactics

 A recent addition to the nation?s political jargon is ?Congressization?. The expression was born in the context of the internal squabbles in the Bharatiya Janata Party, a phenomenon which till now had been associated almost entirely with the Congress. But to think that this ailment would remain restricted to the centrist or right of centre parties was a mistake. It has now entered the Communist Party of India (Marxist) also, or to be more precise, the party is now openly expressing concern over this, indicating how deep the rot has set in.

 In West Bengal, the state committee of the party has decided, as per the announcement of the state unit secretary, Anil Biswas, that public criticism of the leadership or policies will no longer be tolerated. The warning was similar to those issued by the BJP bosses in recent times. Neither the CPI(M) nor the BJP would like to be compared to each other but it is quite clear that both cadre-based parties are today suffering from a kind of indiscipline that had never in the past been associated with them. And there may be a message in the fact that both parties fell victim to this sickness after being in power, albeit for different periods of time.

 The Marxists may protest that such a comparison is not valid because in their case, it is only a few individuals who have been affected. And that this was not quite the case with the BJP. But that is only a difference in degree. Of course, even that argument is questionable, since there is no knowing for sure if a larger part of the body has not been affected. Indeed, if it had just been a couple of erring individuals that the party had to deal with, then Biswas would not perhaps have spoken out; quiet words of caution behind closed doors would have sufficed.

 There appears to be another major cause of concern for the Marxists in the context of a comparison with the BJP. In the latter party, dissidence often has a semblance of an ideological cover. In the case of the Bengal Marxists, the person who is the obvious target of the state leadership?s ire (or of a major part of it) ? namely, Subhas Chakraborty ? has never raised any ideological issues. He seems to have something personal against the chief minister and some others, and this should be embarrassing. An ideological struggle within a communist party is only natural but a personal squabble puts such a party in extremely poor light.

 That there is no ideology involved becomes clear from Chakraborty?s stated position at various points of time. When his party had reservations about globalization, he had called them a ?bunch of fools who cannot see the reality as it is?. Then, when the chief minister got his party to review its position, Chakraborty started making contrary sounds and in the contest of the proposed investment by the Indonesian company, objected to any sacrifice of agricultural land. This would have placed him in the ranks of the conservatives but again he was one with the chief minister in opposing bandhs. So it is clear that he has no ideological position, nor is he consistent. Yet the man is not only a minister but also a member of the state committee of the party. Any observer of the Marxists can only wonder as to how such an individual has risen to his present position.

 An answer to that question can only be had in the fact of the party being in office for so long. Personal ambition has overtaken many and the less cautious give expression to their frustration when such ambitions are not fulfilled to the desired extent. Not quite what one expects from a member of a communist party but then, perhaps, this is inevitable when, because of its preoccupation with a thousand things, the party itself becomes slack. Not that the party is unaware of what is going on; at regular intervals one hears of cleansing operations being undertaken. A bit of dusting does take place at the lower levels but the upper shelves are never touched. Now Anil Biswas has warned that the broom will spare nobody, but will that really happen?

 Very unlikely, is what one can predict with a fair measure of certainty. In a parliamentary democracy, particularly in a country like India where the levels of consciousness are vastly varying, men like Chakraborty serve a very useful purpose, and not just at election time. The CPI(M) today is a mass-based party, which means it requires more than the commited political cadre around it. These others are also commonly known as ?cadre? but they are actually not so, in the sense that they owe allegiance not so much to the ?cause? as to individual big brothers (dada) like Chakraborty. They help to constantly maintain an atmosphere of total mass support for the party, which may not actually always be the case, but which is useful. 

 That Subhas Chakraborty has a huge following among these elements makes him so very important. And that importance will not cease no matter how much the others with greater ideological training may detest him. It must be remembered that even as he groomed younger comrades like Anil Biswas and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, the late Promode Das Gupta had also promoted Subhas Chakraborty. He had realized that in his own way the latter also had a specific role to play. And one cannot deny that time and again he has played that role to the satisfaction of the party.

 There would perhaps have been no problem if the party had acknowledged the services rendered by Chakraborty in a manner he would have liked. But that did not happen. He has been used and will continue to be used but will never be allowed a seat at the high table. This, even though the central committee and the politburo may have men with far lesser organizational skills or experience.

 If Chakraborty had been the ideal selfless, dedicated comrade he would have remained silent as do hundreds in the districts. Unfortunately for the party, he sees things differently. Indeed, he seems to consider politics as a career and is not prepared to suffer obstacles in its path. If he feels it is necessary, he does not hesitate to wash dirty linen in public. He always keeps the leadership on tenterhooks.

 And he is not alone. At various levels of the organization there are men like him. The Lok Sabha member from Dum Dum, Amitabha Nandi, for instance, did not do the party?s image any good when he protested vociferously against the police arrangements made for the Bidhannagar municipal polls. Here too the target was the chief minister, but could the party do anything about this? 

 The BJP had the guts to suspend a veteran like Madan Lal Khurana for speaking against L.K. Advani, but the perceived Stalinists of Alimuddin Street have time and again shied away from any drastic action. Regarding Chakraborty, Anil Biswas has, on more than one occasion, said, ?Subhasda says may things and we ignore him.? That may be taken as a mark of generosity by the CPI(M) leadership, but it also suggests some kind of fear that prompts inaction lest the Pandora?s box is unlocked.

 In the past too the party has ?ignored? people, but in a different context. The late Jyotirmoy Bosu had rendered great service to it, but had never been considered for a place even in the state committee. Bosu had felt hurt but never spoke out and so his personal feelings never affected the party. But ?Subhasda? is made of different stuff.

 One wonders why, if it really cannot take action against him, does the party not accommodate him a little more? Then, does the party also have something personal against him, just as he obviously has something against the chief minister? There appears to be a lack of transparency here, which cannot be explained by the claims of preserving inner-party secrecy. 

 One last word on the subject. There is a school of thought which says that Chakraborty cannot be touched as Jyoti Basu is solidly behind him. That may be true but only to a limited extent. Basu has never been known to go against a decision taken on any organizational matter. And at 92, he is unlikely to change himself.

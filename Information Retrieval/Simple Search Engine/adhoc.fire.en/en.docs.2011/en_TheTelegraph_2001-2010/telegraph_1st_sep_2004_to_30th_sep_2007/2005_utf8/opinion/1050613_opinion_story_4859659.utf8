 WON?T BUDGE

 It was a combination of big business, criminal realtors and contract-killing. But it all went ridiculously wrong because of a tea-stall owner?s resilience. Mr Prabhu Shankar Agarwal of Calcutta had found the perfect match in Mr Gopal Tiwari. Mr Agarwal owned the burgeoning Haldiram chain and is said to be worth Rs 75 crore. Mr Tiwari is an extortionist and contract-killer, hounded out of Calcutta to Hyderabad, and now angling to return to Calcutta and make it again as a realtor, ideally in the Burrabazar area. What brought them together was Mr Satyanarayan Thakur, whose humble but hugely popular tea-stall in one of Mr Agarwal?s properties was coming in the way of the latter?s grandiose construction plans. Mr Agarwal offered him four lakh to move, but Mr Thakur refused because of the local popularity of his stall. Mr Agarwal?s friends and family also seemed to think putting undue pressure on Mr Thakur would not be a good idea. But his ego seriously affronted, Mr Agarwal engaged Mr Tiwari to bump Mr Thakur off for six lakh. Mr Tiwari and his men went for Mr Thakur after a drunken evening, mistook his nephew for him and only managed to shoot his nephew in the thigh, bungling the entire affair. Mr Tiwari was arrested and the entire nexus exposed, eventually leading to Mr Agarwal?s arrest as well.

 The link between real estate development in the city and the criminal underworld will come as no surprise to anybody. This particular episode gives to a ridiculously inflated version of this link a touch of irony that is almost comic. Mr Agarwal?s objection to Mr Thakur?s tea-stall was apparently aesthetic. The stall would mar the fa?ade of the building that he was planning to construct. He had also not expected Mr Thakur?s indifference to the money that he was offering him. Besides, Mr Thakur had practical reasons for not agreeing to move. He would lose most of his regular customers, and would therefore have to depend solely on Mr Agarwal?s money subsequently. To counter this sort of unexpected stubbornness with murder proved to be foolishly disproportionate. Mr Agarwal had also not bargained for Mr Tiwari?s ineptitude as a killer. Mr Agarwal?s unfaltering public brazenness cannot hide the pity of his seriocomic fall.

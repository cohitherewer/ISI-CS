 Paperback Pickings

 A subtle art of negotiation

Spouse: The truth about marriage (Penguin, 

Rs 250) by Shobhaa D? is a clever, readable book ? chatty, entertaining, 

full of a hard common sense that would fill Jane Austen with envy. It cannily 

packages everything that conservative Middle India likes to hear about marriage 

as modern urban chic. ?Share your clothes with ma-in-law. It will make her feel 

young, hip and cool. Offer her your best designer shades, Chanel bag, Prada sandals. 

Take her shopping with your girlfriends.? D? has an eye for detail. In the chapter 

called ?Sex and the City: Tan man ka milan?, one finds, ?Personal hygiene 

is crucial when it comes to intimacy. Make sure you are showered and ?nice smelling? 

before getting to bed. If you can?t shower, at least use a good deo. Nothing kills 

sex more effectively than b.o. and bad breath.? The book ends with D? coming upon 

and then reading, with calm in her heart, a little note left in her diary by her 

husband, ?Dearest wife ? To our permanent union...?, followed by a long quote 

on marriage from the Hindu Samskara.

The complete home loan guide (Penguin, Rs 

275) by Harsh Vardhan Roongta and Krishnan Subramanian will make an 

ideal companion volume to the above ? for the dream couple must seek out its dream 

home. Issues addressed ? usefully but dully, compared to La D? ? are how to select 

property, finalize your budget, tenure of loan, repayment arrangements, NRI loans 

and tax benefits. 

The origin of the world (Rupa, Rs 150) by 

Pierre Michon is Wyatt Alexander Mason?s translation of La Grande Beune 

(1996) by one of France?s important contemporary writers. A twenty-year-old takes 

his first teaching job in a sleepy French town of Castelnau, along the Beune. 

The time is 1961. Lost in a succession of rainy days and sleepless nights, the 

young teacher falls under the spell of one the town?s residents, Yvonne, a woman 

of transcendent beauty. ?In the Renault, she made little cries like a mouse, as 

when one enjoys a meal. The excessive preparations and the total defeat, the leaps 

and the tears, the great great hatchet at the tiny conjunction of two sexes, love, 

in a word, wasn?t her thing.?

Tracking jim: A hunt in corbett country (Penguin, 

Rs 275) by Prosenjit Das Gupta is an absorbing and well-written acnowledgement 

of the author?s remembrance of and respect for Jim Corbett. As the preface outlines, 

the book chronicles Das Gupta?s journey into the life and personality of the hunter-turned-conservationist, 

based on clues picked up from Corbett?s writings and from reminiscences of those 

who had met him in the Forties. It is also the story of actual journeys that Das 

Gupta made into the heart of Corbett country.

Footballeur: An autobiography (Yellow Jersey, 

?4.55) by Robert Pires is an honest and fascinating account of a brilliant 

career. After announcing at the age of eight that he intended to play football 

for a living, he finally achieved his goal when he went to play for Rheims in 

1991. Since then, his career has taken him to Metz, to Marseilles, to Arsenal 

and on to the world stage with Les Bleus. This updated edition now includes 

the story of Arsenal?s 2002/03 and 2003/04 seasons, and France?s Euro 2004 campaign. 

?Football has provided me with an education in life. Within the game I have learned 

how to respect rules, how to work and how to persevere to achieve what I want.?

 FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS

 Ram Swarup Mahato has been pulling his rickshaw for 32 years. And, despite the order passed by the state government, hes not ready to drag his cart off the road so easily 

 Ram Swarup Mahato is a chronicler of the times. From the vinyl billboards of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees new-look Calcutta to an era when the city roads would be washed twice a day ? he has seen it all. There were about 25 Gangakals [outlets for water from the Hooghly] in the space of one kilometre, Mahato says. Once in the morning, at about 6:30, and again around 2:30 in the afternoon, hose pipes would be fitted and the roads would be washed of all their grime. 

 Looking back now, it seems to Mahato that it was a different city he knew then. Theres reason enough for him to feel this way. Mahato is a rickshaw-puller, one of 20,000-odd men who have been ferrying people and goods across Calcuttas lanes and by-lanes since before Independence. Hes also one whom West Bengals CPM-led state government, in an order passed on Independence Day, has promised to thrust from the fringes of the citys existence into its outer darkness. The order states that all hand-drawn rickshaws will have to go off the roads since they are doing nothing to improve the citys image. 

 Mahato, who like most other rickshaw-pullers in Calcutta is from Bihar, doesnt quite know how to react to this. Hes not even sure whether he can believe the governments assurance of an alternative source of employment, or what to do with himself if the order were to come into effect. Hes never been to school, nor learnt any particular trade. 

 On a typical day, which begins with the rising sun and ends only when the shops are downing their shutters, he earns about Rs 150. Even the rickshaw he pulls is not his own, for many of the vehicles are actually owned by policemen. But thats something most rickshaw-pullers would rather not talk about. 

 Instead, they would rather stress the trades links with the city. From carrying newspapers to the vendors to taking children to school on time, we are a part of the daily rhythms of this city, says Mahato, emphatically. 

 Mahato came to Calcutta as a young boy. The faint line of my moustache was just appearing when I landed here, he says, rather evocatively. He mostly did odd jobs at first, such as washing dishes at a hotel. Then my father ? seeing that I was strong enough ? got me the job of pulling a rickshaw. 

 For 32 years hes been doing just that. If the month goes particularly well, I manage to send home about Rs 3,000, Mahato reveals. But now on the wrong side of 50, its unlikely that he will be able to fend for himself if the order is implemented. 

 Theres not much in his village at Motihari ? except burdens far greater than those he carries on his rickshaw ? to go back to. Theres his family ? his wife and three children. My two sons are still quite young ? one just passed class seven this year. My daughter I married off when she was just 17, he says. There was a loan of around Rs 7,000 for the marriage. Even that I repaid with the money I earned here, he adds as an afterthought, patting his beloved rickshaw. 

 But the murmurs against the ban, which can hardly be heard in the din and bustle on the roads during the day, become much stronger in the evening. Mahato and all his brethren gather at their rickshaw garage in Giribabu Lane in central Calcutta. 

 Shagir Mian, who owns about 100 rickshaws in the area, is present. The days collection is sorted out and he gets Rs 20 per carriage. Behind them, as the fires in the forge glow red and the mechanics get ready with their hammers, the conversation heats up. This is just the beginning. There will be gheraos, strikes and, if necessary, well even face bullets, one of the men blurts out. Too many lives depend on these carts. There are the pullers, the mechanics, the owners and all their families ? no way will we give up so easily, says Shagir, whose family has been in the rickshaw business for three generations. 

 Its a resilience that these men from Bihar have picked up on the streets of Calcutta. When all other vehicles go off the roads during curfew or a bandh, the rickshaw is the only one allowed to ply on the streets. So passing through troubled times ? literally ? is something men like Mahato know well. The Babri Masjid riots were the worst. I remember carrying a passenger into an area which was very tense. With the RAF and policemen milling around us, I impulsively raised one hand in the air. Seeing this, one of the policemen walked up to me. I thought there would be trouble. But he just said, Do you want to topple the cart by raising your hand? Let your passenger do that, you just keep moving ahead. 

 But as Mahato talks and the cars zip by, the contradictions of being in charge of a vehicle that faces the danger of becoming an anachronism are evident. Not surprisingly, Mahato does not want his son to enter the same trade. If he gets work nowhere else, this is something he can always take up.

 Still, Mahato is not too worried about what lies in store. It could be hope that keeps him going. Or, maybe, just the strength that comes from living on the edge of an uncertain future.

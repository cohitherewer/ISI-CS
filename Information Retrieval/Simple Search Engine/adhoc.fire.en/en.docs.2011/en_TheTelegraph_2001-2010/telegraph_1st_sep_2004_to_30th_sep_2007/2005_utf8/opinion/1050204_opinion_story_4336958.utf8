 Paperback Pickings

 Parisians and post- realists

The Harpercollins book of Urdu stories (Rs 

295) edited by Muhammad Umar Memon is an excellent collection of beautifully 

done translations, but strangely lacking in the most rudimentary editorial apparatus. 

Memon makes his bias as selector quite clear ? he has chosen writers who have 

emerged since the partition of India in 1947. The earlier masters ? Premchand, 

Krishan Chandar, Manto, Chughtai and Rajinder Singh Bedi ? are absent in this 

anthology. The writers include Muhammad Salim-ur-Rahman, Parveen Sarwar, Balraj 

Manra, Naiyer Masud, Anwer Khan, Khalida Husain and Jeelani Bano. The editor?s 

brief preface traces the stories back to Premchand and the Progressive Writers? 

Movement, but shows how these later writers took the Urdu short story beyond this 

movements achievements towards a form of ?post-realist? writing. There is 

very little documentation about the writers and translators ? dates, places of 

publication, further reading. This can be frustrating for the many readers who 

would be inspired by this anthology to want to read more of and about these writers. 

Naiyer Masuds ?Obscure Domains of Fear and Desire? is a particularly beautiful 

story.

Blues for a black cat and other stories (Rupa, 

Rs 195) by Boris Vian is Julia Olders delightful translation 

of this inimitable French writer?s story. As his friend, Louis Malle, explains 

in his preface, ?In Paris in the 1950s Boris Vian was everything ? poet, fiction 

writer, singer, subversive, actor, musician, and jazz critic.? Malle admired his 

friend passionately for his ?eclecticism, devastating irony, and taste for provocation?. 

From ?Cancer?: ?Jaques Teagarden didn?t feel well. His head stretched in one direction 

and his brain in another. In the intervening hollow, foreign bodies slowly introduced 

themselves ? fluid parasitic thoughts, and a sharp invasive pain similar to acid 

in the throat.?

 Celebrating Krishna: Sacred words and sensuous 

images (Mapin, $ 35) by Harsha V. Dehejia looks like an invitation 

to a very opulent wedding. It is actually a collection of little reproductions 

of art ? from miniatures to Hussain ? depicting various aspects of the life of 

Krishna. These are the images; the words are a parallel text of the Bhagavata 

Purana.

 NEW REPUBLIC

 The life of a republic is nothing without challenges. The Indian republic, immediately after its birth, was faced with the daunting task of making itself a major player in the community of nations. The Indian republic only partially met this challenge. Its economic backwardness and the military debacle it suffered in 1962 at the hands of China prevented India from being considered as a serious contender to sit at the high table. In the late Sixties and early Seventies, under Indira Gandhi, India proved to the world that it was not a mean performer at realpolitik. But the fabric of the republic was threatened from within by the imposition of the Emergency. In the Eighties, the Indian republic had to confront the problem of growing Hindu fundamentalism. This phenomenon appeared poised to subvert one of the fundamental premises of the Indian Constitution. But the republic withstood this onslaught. It defended secularism through democracy. The defeat of the Bharatiya Janata Party in the elections and the retreat of Hindu fundamentalism suggested the robust health of the republic and also of the strength of the pillars of the Constitution.

 The upholding of democracy and the defence of secularism did not guarantee the third promise of the republic: the creation of wealth and the eradication of poverty. As the republic turns fifty five, greater concern needs to be devoted to this problem. The new era of economic promise which began with the inauguration of the economic reforms addresses this problem head on. Economic reforms have not been without success but the success has only highlighted the problematic relationship between creation of wealth and the elimination of poverty. Mr Manmohan Singh, as prime minister and previously as the finance minister who masterminded the reform process, has always argued that the free market and welfare are not mutually exclusive ideas and ideals. They can be brought together through imaginative policy-making and its implementation. Under the leadership of Mr Singh, the challenge of creating wealth without further aggravating the existing inequalities in society stands a reasonable chance of being met and being overcome. In the new century, when in many fields the Indian republic is emerging as a powerful player, its domestic economic performance will always be under scrutiny and be considered the essential condition for its coming of age and maturity.

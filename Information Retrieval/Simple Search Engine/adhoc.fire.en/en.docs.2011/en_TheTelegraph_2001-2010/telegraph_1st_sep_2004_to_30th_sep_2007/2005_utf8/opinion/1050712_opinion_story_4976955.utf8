 POOR EXCUSE

 Rebels do not necessarily look for causes; rebellion itself is their cause. It is simplistic, therefore, to link the Maoist violence in some districts of West Bengal to the lack of development there. This is not to deny that these areas are among the poorest in the state. That makes it easier for the Maoists to recruit their cadre or sympathizers from the poor in these places. Despite the panchayats and 28 years of the Left Front?s rule, parts of Bankura, Purulia and the two districts of Midnapore remain pretty much areas of darkness. There is thus an element of the absurd in the claim by Mr Anil Biswas, the state secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), that the latest Maoist strikes in Bankura and Purulia were aimed at stalling the government?s development projects. His party comrades themselves would tell a different story ? of how the Maoists had taken advantage of the poverty and other deprivations in these districts. The government cannot possibly have a proper strategy to deal with the rebels if the ruling party starts believing in its own propaganda. The first step in meeting the challenge is to face the reality.

 There is enough indication that the reality is pretty grim. That is one reason why the rebels keep striking at regular intervals. And this, despite all the additional intelligence and security arrangements. Obviously, there are still enough gaps in all these to enable the Maoists to pursue their hit-and-run tactics. The areas? proximity to Jharkhand and Orissa is clearly a problem for the government since the two states have a stronger rebel presence. It also underscores the need for greater co-ordination among the states and the Centre to tackle the threat. But the anti-Maoist strategies of New Delhi as well as many states seem to have a greater handicap. Their governments appear to be quite undecided about whether to fight the rebels or to talk to them. Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has ruled out talks with them unless they give up violence. True, the Maoists in Bengal are a tiny political group compared to their comrades in Andhra Pradesh, Orissa and Jharkhand. But then, the chief minister needs to ask himself why the state cannot stamp out the threat. Unless beaten in the outlying areas, the rebels could grow bolder and strike elsewhere. It may be unwise to raise an alarm, but Mr Bhattacharjee cannot afford to be complacent.

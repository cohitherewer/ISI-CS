 Letters to Editor

 Street theatre

 Sir ? Petty theatrics ? that?s what Biman Bose?s ploy to take to the streets of Calcutta, begging ?bucket? in hand, was. Bose said his aim was to collect funds with which to appeal in the Supreme Court against the Calcutta high court decree sentencing him to three days? imprisonment and a fine of Rs 10,000. But it is quite inconceivable that Bose?s party has no one who can bear his legal expenses. The major expense in fighting a case in the Supreme Court is the lawyer?s fees and in Bose?s case, this won?t be needed since the Communist Party of India (Marxist) has a number of legal luminaries among its members and sympathizers. Only the nominal sum towards court fees is needed, which can well be borne by, say Jyoti Basu or Somnath Chatterjee. Of course, there is an advantage in collecting funds off the streets since the public will not demand any accountability for the funds collected.

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Harsh cut

 Sir ? The decision to ban Sourav Ganguly for six matches for the slow over rate during the fourth one-day international against Pakistan was shocking. With this ruling, the match referee, Chris Broad, has not only denied Ganguly the chance to play in the remaining one-dayers but also dealt a blow to the prospects of the Indian team which suddenly found itself without its regular skipper. The ban is especially harsh since the entire team, and not just Ganguly, was responsible for slowing down proceedings in Ahmedabad. Moreover, the hot and humid weather also led to loss of time during the match. It would have been better had Broad banned Ganguly for two, and not six, matches. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Our selectors don?t seem to realize that captaincy means much more than scoring runs. Hence, their decision to drop the out-of-form Ganguly for the last two matches was hasty and imprudent. It is true that the Indian captain is struggling for runs at the moment. But can it be denied that he has been able to hold his team together and retain its fighting qualities despite his poor run with the bat? This is borne out by the fact that the two matches India lost under Ganguly were closely fought. But the ones with Rahul Dravid as stand-in captain saw India surrender meekly to Afridi and co. This is not to say that Dravid is not a great player and an excellent team man. But he is no Ganguly who can pay the opposition back in its own coin ? remember his famous showdown with Steve Waugh? 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Lady Luck is certainly frowning on Sourav Ganguly at the moment. The Indian captain has been facing brickbats for a while now, thanks to his woeful form. And now he has been slapped with a six-match suspension by Chris Broad. It is true that Ganguly has not been among runs of late. But that can happen to any player. Even the great Sachin Tendulkar was struggling before scoring a century in Motera. So why has the media singled out Ganguly for harsh treatment? The funny thing is that once the Indian captain comes good with the bat, the media will start praising him, forgetting how they had railed him earlier. Perhaps the media should make up its mind about Ganguly first.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The suspension of Sourav Ganguly is fully justified, not only because of his showing on and off the field, but also because the match referee has done what the Indian selectors failed to accomplish ? throw Ganguly out of the side. In cricket, every player goes through a bad patch but in Ganguly?s case, the lean period has gone on for far too long. Sadly, the Indian captain seems to lack the strength of mind to come out of his poor form, which is making him look like a club-level player.

 Yours faithfully,

Susobhan Sarkar, Calcutta

 Sir ? First, we had Clive Lloyd banning Ganguly for a slow over rate in November. And now, it is the turn of Chris Broad to penalize Ganguly for the same offence. It took the match referee only five minutes to slap the ban on the Indian captain but one wonders whether Broad considered the factors that led to the delay. The match was fought hard with both teams pressing for a win. Under such circumstances, it is impossible for a captain to keep track of the over rate as he has other things on his mind. One thought match referees were men of repute. But Broad?s decision raises questions about their integrity. Hopefully, the Indian cricket board will stand solidly behind Ganguly like it did during the Lloyd episode. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sumant Poddar, Calcutta 

 Sir ? There is no denying that Ganguly is a successful captain under whom India has won many matches. But as a professional, he should have known that his lack of form was bound to have an effect on his captaincy, as well as on the performance of his team. International cricket matches are not played to give match practice to out-of-form players like Ganguly. A cricketer is paid to perform and if he fails, he should be dropped without any scruples as the selectors have done with Ganguly. 

 Yours faithfully,

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta

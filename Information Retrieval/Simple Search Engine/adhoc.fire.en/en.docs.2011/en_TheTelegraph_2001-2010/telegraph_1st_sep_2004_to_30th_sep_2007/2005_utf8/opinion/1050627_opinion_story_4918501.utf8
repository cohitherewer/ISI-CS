 BODY POLICE

 It might become difficult for a young woman with an uncomplicated relationship with her own body to live in Mumbai. This is because some of the figures of authority in her public life have a very complicated relationship with her body. If she manages to look attractive, policemen might rape her, politicians defend the policemen, and college principals make life easier for both by deciding what she should not wear henceforth. In a city famed for having achieved its uniquely modern and liberal character, the possibility of a dress code for students ? especially female students ? is especially regressive, even uncivilized. But this is what Mumbai University is seriously considering, in spite of robust opposition from some college authorities, student bodies and civil society groups. The matter is particularly unsavoury because it is happening after the rape of a minor girl by a constable in his police post on the Marine Drive. The Shiv Sena mouthpiece, Samnaa, had followed this up by castigating women, corrupted by Page Three mores, for inflaming male lust by dressing provocatively. This, together with the running controversy over the many women working as entertainers and staff in the dance bars. Keeping sexed males pure has suddenly become a civic agenda, and the easiest way to do this is to control the bodies, lives and work of women. And in this, it is shocking to see the extent to which institutions like the police and the university, and often the state as well, readily see eye to eye, and actually work in some sort of implicit collusion.

 Trying to imagine, in practical terms, how such a dress code might be maintained across a wide range of colleges could be an interesting exercise. Presumably, people would be entrusted with the specific task of looking women up and down to see whether what they are wearing might make a man want to rape or ?eve-tease? her. Nothing could be more bizarre, perverse and, indeed, barbaric, than such a policeman-like gaze. It is demeaning for not only the women, but for the men, who are being spared such temptation. It is not only inimical to the spirit of a mature and modern democracy, but also deeply at odds with the spirit of higher education. This can only result in a lamentable crisis of liberty, trust and dignity. It would also mean an abuse of power that is at once unjust and perverted.

 CENTRE HOLDS

 West Bengal is out on its luck. The Left Front government?s perpetual grouse against the Central allocation of funds has acquired a new dimension. The West Bengal government is now claiming that it is being penalized for being successful. West Bengal is a net loser in the allocation made by the twelfth finance commission. One reason for this is the change made in the parameters that are used to calculate the allocation of resources. The major changes have been instituted in two categories: population and poverty. In previous calculations, population was given a weightage of 10 per cent; this has now increased to 25. Poverty had a weightage of 62.5 per cent; this has now been brought down to 50. The implication of this is clear: those states with a higher population will command a greater share of resources than they did in previous years, and those states with a higher poverty level will get less money than they did in the past. Thus, states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh will make up under the category of population what they lose under the poverty head. But West Bengal will lose on both counts since it is not high on the population list but is high on the poverty list. Prima facie it has cause to bear a grouse.

 This grouse, however, is only partly valid. It is indeed ridiculous to increase the weightage of population. Reduction of population should be made mandatory for all states to secure any form of financial subvention from the Centre. But West Bengal will not be the only state to suffer because of successfully addressing the population problem. The same fate has befallen the southern states. Instead of bemoaning a non-existent discrimination, West Bengal should join cause with them. The issue with reducing the weightage on poverty is a little different. Reduction of poverty is synonymous with economic development. Thus it is entirely logical to reduce the weightage put on poverty. It is ironic that the Left Front government should argue against this. The high level of poverty prevailing in rural West Bengal should not be something the Left Front should highlight and shout about in order to get more funds. It is important also to underline, in the context of the finance commission?s allocations, that the West Bengal government is laggard in the tax collection category. The state?s finance minister, Mr Asim Dasgupta, should take note of this.

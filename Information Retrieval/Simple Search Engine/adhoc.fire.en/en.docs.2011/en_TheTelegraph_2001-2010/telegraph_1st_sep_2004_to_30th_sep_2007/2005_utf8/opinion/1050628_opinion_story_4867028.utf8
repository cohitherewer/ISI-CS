 SO THAT THEY MAY LIVE

 Swift trials and harsh punishment may discourage criminals from targeting the elderly, writes Bhaskar Ghose 

The author is former secretary, ministry of information and broadcasting

 Home alone

 People expect old men to die,/ They do not really mourn old men./ Old men are different.../ People watch them with unshocked eyes;/ But the old men know when an old man dies.

 The poet who wrote these lines is held in great affection as a humorous poet, one whose ?Candy is dandy, but liquor is quicker? has passed into legend as a way to break the ice with a lady. But he has darker, poignant poems, not so well known, like the one quoted, which is as relevant when he wrote it, perhaps forty years ago or even earlier, as it is today. Not only in his native America, but here, in the metropolitan cities, where criminals have identified a new lot of victims, who cannot usually resist, and who they think have some assets stored away ? the old, especially the old who live alone.

 Delhi has been one city where criminals have been relatively quicker to identify this soft target; there have been a number of murderous attacks on old men and women usually living alone, and even on couples who have been too feeble to resist. And now there are these instances in Calcutta, the latest being that of Laxmi Sundaram, living alone in a flat on Bishop Lefroy Road, a road once known as the one where Satyajit Ray had his home.

 Criminals, an officer of the Calcutta Police once told me, are as professional a lot as carpenters or masons or even others higher in the social scale, doctors, lawyers and so on. They assess every job, weigh the various factors involved ? the risk of resistance and the nature of that resistance, the possible returns, the likelihood of being caught, and so on ? and decide whether a planned burglary or break-in is worth the effort. For example, the officer explained, given two houses that were considered to be good targets, they would choose the one that didn?t have a dog and not the one that did. Clearly, the old are considered to be tempting targets on this scale of assessment, and given the very low probability of resistance, the pickings would be worth the effort.

 What are the police doing about this? A good question, but if you stop to think about it, what is it that the police can do, except in a very limited way? They can identify those in the jurisdiction of a police station who are old and living alone, and visit them at regular intervals, keep an eye on people lurking around their houses or apartment blocks and increase night patrols. Which is all very well, but will it really make a difference?

 Identifying old men and women, or old couples, living alone is, however, not always a desirable thing. That kind of knowledge can be very dangerous, even if it is with the police. A police station is not always a very safe place where such knowledge can be kept from criminals. If it is a place where information is secretly collected on the activities of criminals, it is also a place from which criminals can obtain information. Many years ago, I once asked the local police station to keep an eye on my mother?s flat in Jodhpur Park, Calcutta, as she was going to be away for some months. I held a position of some consequence then, or at least, of consequence to the police. An assistant commissioner came and assured me that a very special watch would be kept on the flat. It was, indeed, a very special watch; a week later it was broken into and the very modest belongings my mother had left behind were meticulously taken away. I realized with some mortification that if I?d kept my mother?s absence to myself, the burglary might, in all probability, never have taken place. But this may have been a rare incident, one of a kind.

 The sad fact is that the way in which our societies are developing, there are going to be more and more old people living alone. It has to do with the concept of the nuclear family, of a couple wanting their own accommodation, and the slow but inexorable accretion of some wealth with the middle class which leads to them being able to move out. This often helps preserve bonds of affection, but that comes at a price which young couples don?t want to hear about.

 And there are circumstances where the old have no alternative to living alone; their children seek their fortune elsewhere, if not abroad then in other cities, and even if they do visit their parents regularly, such visits cannot be anything more than annual affairs. All of these factors have helped the criminals in our cities identify the old as soft, easy targets.

 What then does one do? Sit back and let the old be killed? That is a solution; as the poet, Ogden Nash, says, people expect old men to die, and women too, one can safely add. This is not something so terrible, but often a reaction to circumstances with which humans cannot cope. But rather than fly before events and compulsions, one can look at the few means we have of making at least some difference.

 The one most evident is the need to have such crimes investigated swiftly and the perpetrators prosecuted with the same urgency through summary trials. Too often the criminals are not caught, or if they are, their trials go on and on and in the end they are either let off or get a light sentence. It is equally necessary that the sentences handed down be exemplary, so that they act as more effective deterrents than anything else. If the state can ensure all these three, then in the long term there just may be a lessening of attacks on the old. As that canny police officer had told me, criminals are professionals, and will not undertake a job where the risks outweigh the gains.

 The media, too, have a responsibility here. They report the crime in all its gruesome detail, but when, in the fullness of time the guilty are caught and punished, the reports aren?t really as prominently featured. Yes, there are other stories to cover and report by then; we all know that, but if these are seen a little differently by the news editors, the prominence the punishments get ? as Dhananjoy Chatterjee?s punishment got ? will help. I?m not saying that the coverage given to that man?s hanging has reduced the incidence of rape; I am saying that such coverage, over a period of time, can alter perceptions of the crimes, depicting them as acts that bring in their wake retribution that is not pleasant.

 These may be small, and in the final analysis not very effective steps; but they are some steps, and even if they don?t eradicate the killing of old people, they may just reduce the number attacked and killed. To that extent, at least, they may be valuable steps, worth considering.

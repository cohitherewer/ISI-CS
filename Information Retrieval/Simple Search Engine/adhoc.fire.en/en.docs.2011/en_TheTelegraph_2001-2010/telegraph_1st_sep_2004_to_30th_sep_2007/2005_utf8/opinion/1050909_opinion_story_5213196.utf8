 SHOP WITHOUT GOODS

 MALVIKA SINGH

 It was after a lapse of many years that I visited the National Museum and was saddened beyond belief. It is the epitome of babudom at its worst. Having been frisked by some sullen creature, you enter the portals of a building that houses some of the greatest treasures of this world, treasures that had made India the magnet for explorers, conquerors and traders alike. Today, all that this space embodies is neglect within an unkempt environment, with lazy employees slouching about on hideous chairs with unacceptable upholstery, pitiful signages, antiquated display in the galleries ? all adding to a stifling atmosphere of a government operation devoid of energy, vibrancy, style, taste, creativity which were and still are the great attributes of India outside of the government. 

 It is shocking that in circa 2005, the ministry of culture has not been able to shake this one institution out of its stupor and rejuvenate it. There are hundreds of sensitive and qualified Indians, here and abroad, who have expertise in this special area. Why are they not drawn in to make the walk through this national showcase a memorable experience? Why can we not be like all the other museums across the world? Why is the National Museum in New Delhi the worst space in the world? Why is it all so sloppy? What have Indians done to deserve this horror? 

 Museums are accorded the highest social status in virtually all countries because they present and project identity and pride. Our National Museum represents only one aspect of India ? its babudom and an unthinking bureaucracy. To achieve international standards, we must ensure that the government lays off and only participates on the board as an ex officio member. At the helm must be an art historian, assisted on the board by professionals of other disciplines. 

 Strange things

 Ministers and secretaries of culture fly around the world under any pretext, misusing taxpayers? money, visiting museums and suchlike, but they fail to do anything at all to revitalize our own. Are they not ashamed to hold their posts and preside over decaying, decrepit and musty institutions? Or, do they know no better? 

 I walked into the ?museum shop? on the ground floor, different from the shop on the first floor. That alone is ridiculous. The ground floor shop, run by the ministry of culture, accepts only cash, rupees, and the first floor one, run by the Handicrafts and Handlooms Export Corporation of India accepts only American Express! This in India circa 2005. Who thought up this mind boggling system? How do overseas visitors pay if they have Visa cards or foreign exchange? And, do all Indians have to be members of Amex? Absurd. 

 Museum shops everywhere generate huge amounts of revenue for the institution. The V amp;A, the British Museum, the Metropolitan Museum in New York, the Louvre, you name it, they all have great shops. The Met, for example, buys huge amounts of ?artifacts? from India for their shop. But the shop at our National Museum is abysmal to say the least. Third-rate design, third-rate products. It is worse than the worst souvenir shops that sprout outside ?tourist sites?. And there is no excuse for this since India is the living repository of the greatest skills in this world. Dilli Haat has far more to offer in the area of craft. We have wonderful books on arts, crafts, culture, painting et al, published in India, which should be in the shop. Jewellers today create fine jewellery based on traditional designs which must be retailed there. And much, much more. 

 Surely, the government of India needs to compel its ministry of culture to put some of the basics in place. The prime minister must energize the National Museum, an institution which, through its treasures, represents and reflects the multiple strengths of our layered and plural culture.

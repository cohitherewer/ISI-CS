 JUST DEFINE IT

 Why is there a health minister in a state like West Bengal or Uttar Pradesh? Malaria, arsenic-poisoning, and now dengue and Japanese encephalitis ? each of these diseases, some of them epidemics, are the special achievements of these important personages, kept up ? in some cases, over years ? through a mix of inefficiency, callousness, ignorance and a typically bureaucratic absence of shame. Sometimes, these qualities come topped with a capacity for making banal statements in public. Mr Surya Kanta Mishra, who oversees Bengal?s healthcare inferno, has come up with a novel method of dealing with dengue in his state: if it cannot be controlled, then let it be declared an ?epidemic?. And in doing so, the government?s highest duties are promptly fulfilled. Moreover, just in case the people misunderstand the word, ?epidemic?, Mr Mishra has even offered to give it a postcolonial definition that takes away its deathly sting. This, after systematically misrepresenting the dengue situation to the public for days.

 What the dengue epidemic has exposed, yet again, is not only the absence of infrastructure in Calcutta, the towns and the villages, but also the complete political and administrative failure to do anything about the outbreak at every stage. The dithering and bungling started with the inability to reach diagnostic kits to key health centres all over the state, and in the city. The minister and his men thought that these would be wasted when the epidemic dies out. They have now admitted that dengue has been a regular occurrence in Bengal for years. Hence, not only have people been improperly diagnosed, and therefore treated symptomatically, particularly in the districts, but there has also been no documentation of the nature and extent of the epidemic. Not that this would have made any difference to the ministry.

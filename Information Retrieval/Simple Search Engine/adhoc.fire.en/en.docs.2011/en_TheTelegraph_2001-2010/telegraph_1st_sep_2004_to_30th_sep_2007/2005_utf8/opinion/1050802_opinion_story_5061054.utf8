 CITY PEOPLE

 Nature has been singularly unkind to Mumbai. This is the theme of the administration?s frantic justifications to angry citizens. Comparisons to Manhattan are being rubbished, and the failure of the government to restore power, repair communication lines, manage the airport, reach relief to devastated villages and provide adequate and clean drinking water is being heatedly discussed. The scandals behind the city?s infrastructural development are being aired. Reckless reclamation, jamming of drainage systems and greedy construction ? considered dangerous by environment specialists who were discarded as advisors because they spoke of unpleasant possibilities ? have obviously contributed to the breakdown of the metropolis. While the administration must plead guilty to these charges, it has also to be asked how far this kind of development has helped Mumbai, the financial capital of the country and the heart of its entertainment industry, become home to some of the richest and most powerful Indian citizens.

 There is a sudden stirring among those ranks. Perhaps for the first time, the very rich and the very poor in Mumbai struggled together through unimaginable depths of water and were prey to the same terrors. Beyond the range of the primal, the damage is relative. Among the slum-dwellers and villagers, there are lost lives, lost homes, lost livelihoods ? in the village of Pen, numberless craftsmen have had their Ganapati idols destroyed with no way to fulfil orders in time ? and at the other end of the spectrum, at least 150 Mercedes have stalled on the roads, with each needing Rs 10 to 12 lakh for repairs. Some well-known citizens, including the filmmaker Mr Mahesh Bhatt, have constituted a forum called Jaago India to file a public interest litigation against the government?s poor response to the disaster. But the awakening implied here comes a little late. These prominent citizens, or the many famous ones passionate about the rights of the underprivileged, or the very rich ? three of India?s biggest industrial houses have their headquarters here ? evidently did not notice either the conditions under which the poor live or the dangers being posed by Mumbai?s aspiration to become Shanghai. The government is made by the people. So is the city. Before accusing it, perhaps the famous citizens of Mumbai should think whether they could have made the government more responsible and the city more liveable.

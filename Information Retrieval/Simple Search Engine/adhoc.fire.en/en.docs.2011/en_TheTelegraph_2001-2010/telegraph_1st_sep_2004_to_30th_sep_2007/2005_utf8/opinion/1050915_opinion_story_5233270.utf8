 DREAM MERCHANT

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee seems desperately hopeful that his state?s transformation will yield fringe benefits for all, says Sumanta Sen

 Inheritance of the meek

 Anita lives in Sonarpur. She works as a part-time domestic help in a number of houses to marginally bolster her husband?s earnings. Her son was scratched by a stray cat and the local doctor said he would have to be given three injections. The treatment was expensive and she could manage the cost of only two. She could have gone to the Infectious Diseases Hospital, but the journey would have been too long and her absence from work would have angered the families who had contributed towards the price of the vaccines. So far, the child has not developed any complications, but who can tell for certain that the incomplete course will not take its toll in the days to come.

 This is not an isolated case. Indeed such instances have become the rule among the poor. What makes Anita?s case slightly different is that while she was running from pillar to post for the money needed, the television channels and newspapers were full of the proposed Health City to come up in the same South 24-Parganas where Sonarpur is located. Anita, of course, does not know this. Such knowledge is meaningless to her. Even if the health city becomes a reality, will she be able to approach it? No, it will be another forbidden area for her and millions like her. The target audience of any such private enterprise is only the creamy layer of the public.

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee knows this. He remarked recently that privately-owned hospitals and nursing homes were for the rich and the state-owned ones for the poor. Yet he is sparing no efforts to ensure that it is the rich who have more facilities at their disposal. Perhaps he believes that the benefits of the Health City will also trickle down to the Anitas of society.

 This is doubtful, to say the least. When the whole state-owned healthcare system is in a mess, what trickle-down-effect can they hope for and why should people who own the sources of such benefits, allow even a drop to be ?wasted?? And even if they do, may they not in the future seek to expand their empire to cover the domain of the public sector also, holding out the carrot of providing better healthcare, of course at a price? Will the state government lap up such an offer while every effort is being made to convince people that the best government is that which governs the least?

 Such speculations apart, has it ever occurred to the chief minister and his think tank that projects like a Health City in the private sector is a cruel joke amid the conditions prevailing in the state? Diseases like malaria, dengue and other ?unidentified ones? have become a part of life. The government is clearly at a loss about how to combat these, even if it has the will to do so. Hospitals, both in the city and in the districts, are hell-holes; if there are doctors there is no medicine and vice versa. Corruption is rampant, relations of patients are bled white. 

 Bhattacharjee knows this, as does everybody else. He also knows that he is no Hercules and hence cleaning up the Aegean stables is a task beyond him. It is easy to be a dream merchant. Hence the talk of a Health City. He knows he will be fulfilling the dreams of only a fraction of the population. But there are signs that this small fraction may become friendly voters, and so the process has to be helped. The much larger percentage of the population will, of course, have to live and die in the existing stink and squalor, but what can be done?

 This is the problem with the man who wishes, perhaps, to be remembered as Bengal?s Deng Xiaoping. He seems overly eager in his bid to get things done, to turn a blind eye to the festering wounds of the present while speaking of a healthy future. Workers in the huge jute and tea industries are groaning while he sings the praise of information technology, which brings only a pocketful of jobs and that too for the elite. He wants to break away from the past in every respect, mindless of the fact that there cannot be sunshine if the gloom persists.

 One is not for a moment suggesting that new avenues need not be explored. But such an exploration becomes meaningless, even dangerous, when the purpose of the effort has no relevance for the masses. When the proposed Health City does come up, dazzling in its exclusivity, will the MPs and MLAs of the district be able to convince the poor that the forbidden grounds of today can be open to them tomorrow if they put in a bit of hard work?

 The poor, as the poor everywhere, are meek. They do not demand too much for the simple reason that they have learnt not to aspire for what is beyond them. But at the same time, they do expect something from the government. That expectation has been aroused by Bhattacharjee?s own party and its allies. Will the poor remain meek when they see the same government ignoring their expectations and spending all its energy in meeting the demands of the few? 

 The same goes for the students of what are apologies of schools in the districts. They read newspapers and they know that there is also a proposal to build a Knowledge City. They may not know what it will turn out to be, but they most certainly know it will be something far removed from their reality of leaking roofs and absentee teachers. Will their anger not grow when they realize, with time, that there is no getting away from a world divided between ?them? and ?us?. Ritual official receptions for a handful of students from the districts who do well in examinations will not act as a balm when that anger grows. And perhaps erupts.

 Since the time he took over as chief minister six years ago, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has always appeared to be a man in a hurry. There is nothing wrong in hurrying along, but there are two problems that need to be avoided. The first is colliding with others, and Bhattacharjee has done that more than once. But even now he does not seem to have learnt his lesson. The second is more serious. A man in a hurry is often unmindful of the world around him; or even if he does see it, he does not observe, as was the failing of Watson which Sherlock Holmes repeatedly pointed out. If Bhattacharjee had truly been observant, he would have realized what the conditions demand of him. A developing country demands development from the bottom, not just a few eye-catching gadgets which, by their nature, can be of help to only a few.

 In the context of the projects now under discussion, both the chief minister and his industries minister have repeatedly stressed that these would ?totally transform? life in the South 24-Parganas district. May one humbly remind the duo that the political philosophy they believe in insists that such transformation is impossible in a bourgeois society? Or are they talking about performing the ?historical task? of replacing feudalism with capitalism and hoping such a transformation is bound to yield fringe benefits for all?

 RAINS AND THE INDIAN

 Malvika Singh

 To celebrate the human spirit one has to look to the citizens of Mumbai and see the real attachment, commitment and resolve they have shown to restore dignity to life and living in their great metropolis. Their pride was the catalyst for the citizens to assert and demand their rights. Years of political exploitation, municipal and administrative corruption drowned the commercial capital of India with one major rainfall. Within hours the citizenry had acted, taken on the responsibility to fight the profound failure of the government and its octopus like departments, and pledged to compel the administration to deliver the goods.

 Is this a foreshadowing of the future? Will Mumbai lead the battle against corrupt and exploitative authorities? Will we finally make accountable those men and women who live off the wealth created by hardworking Indians? Think of this dream scenario, one where public interest litigations are filed in courts across India, on the same day, thousands of them, in a gesture to enforce the ?authority? to do its jobs with integrity. We could christen this day Freedom From Corruption Day. We could celebrate this day each year by making civil servants and politicians accountable through processes of satyagraha and jurisprudence since executive authority seems to have been obliterated from the face of India.

 Imagine a new India without self-appointed ?very important persons?, hideous lights flashing atop their cars, trying desperately to show that they are different from the rest. And they are. They appear crass when compared to normal Indians. They are the culprits who took India and Bharat for an age-old ride. Those blinking red and blue lights symbolize failure, exploitation and corruption. We all know the type that zips about in those strange, blackened windowed vehicles with strange wailing sounds emanating from them. The people of India, whether rich or poor, are far superior to this group of ?reserved? VIPs and the other, more ripened species called the VVIPs. Hopefully, they will soon be an endangered lot, and will have to be ?protected? in human zoos, locked in cages lest they run amuck again, with visitors pointing and saying, ?Is that the one who?.??

 Taxing the innocent

 Ramparts of the Red Fort. August 15, 2005. Dull, boring, predictable political platitudes resound. We have heard similar sentiments over decades. We have seen the betrayal. We have witnessed the degradation of our polity. If only the prime minister, who is different from the run-of-the-mill politico, had not ?addressed? the people but had ?taken them into confidence?, shared with them his anguish about the many failures as well as his dreams for the future, Manmohan Singh would have stood apart.

 One demeaning image that has become an intrinsic part of the urban landscape is the ?protective security? around those who betrayed us. Why do we, the tax-payers, have to support the protection of all those whose mandate was and is to protect us, but who broke their own rules, who failed to protect the citizens (1984, Gujarat, Mumbai), who created the social anarchy around us, who diluted the dignity of citizens, who were unable to enforce law and order where rape and murder have become commonplace, and who need to protect themselves against the latent anger of citizens they have ?assaulted?? It is a scandal. Wherever one sees those gun-toting creatures one knows that an unsavoury character is passing by, breaking cordons, lights and rules with sirens announcing the horror. Those with such blatant ?protection? are suspect in the eyes of Indians.

 Let?s cleanse this unsavoury blot on a historically splendid landscape. Let?s demand the eradication of this pollutant. Let?s regain the grace of an inclusive society. Let?s call the bluff of those who diluted our spirit.

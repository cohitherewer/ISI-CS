 GIVE THEM AN INCH

 BEENA SARWAR

 The folk tale about the camel who stuck a foot in its master?s tent, ostensibly to shelter from the cold, and eventually pushed its master out reminds one of the vigilantes trying to thrust their views on our lives.

 In recent months, the mullahs have pushed their way to victory on the issue of the religion column in the new, machine-readable Pakistani passport. The government meekly agreed to what it thought was a non-issue, hoping, perhaps, that by doing so, religious extremism would be denied a battering ram. But symbols are important. The inclusion of the religion column only emboldened the mullahs further and they looked around for another battering ram.

 They found it shortly after. Following the success of the Lahore Marathon, the sports board of Punjab was organizing marathons to prepare athletes for the next one in January 2006. According to a report, ?People from all walks of life will be allowed to participate in the marathons.? Last I checked, ?women? came under the category of ?people?, but obviously the Muttahida Majlis-e-Ammal has different ideas. So we had the spectacle of hundreds of armed vigilantes hurling petrol bombs, destroying public property and attacking the participants of the Gujranwala marathon.

 It is commendable that the Punjab assembly, debating the issue for two hours the next day, unanimously adopted a declaration denouncing the incident as an act of terrorism and ?a violation of women?s basic and constitutional rights?. But instead of coming down heavily on the miscreants, the government released all those arrested for the attack in Gujranwala. This further emboldened the mullahs, coming as it did on the heels of the Punjab government?s announcement that there would be no more mixed marathons.

 Fair trouble

 Given the administration?s easygoing attitude, it is no wonder that vigilantes in Khairpur had the gall to threaten and abuse the district nazim, Nafisa Shah. Her crime: she directed the district police to allow a commercial group to hold a women?s festival that the local religious vigilante group was opposed to. One of their objections was the name of the organization holding the mela, the Ayesha Welfare Trust. Vowing that they would not allow ?obscenity? to take place under this sacred name, they took over the venue for some nine hours as the police stood by and watched. It was finally on Shah?s intervention that the event took place at all.

 Those in the know say that the police?s reluctance to grant permission to the mela had more to do with the organizers? refusal to cough up the hefty bhatta that is usual in such situations ? which is generally shared with the local disrupters. Eventually, it is believed that such a transaction did take place. Even so, the mela was forced to close down a day earlier, on April 19.

 Shah believes that she was targeted because she opted for an ?upfront confrontation? with the religious body instead of stepping back as most politicians do. Strangely, the mullahs ? so quick to see obscenity everywhere ? see nothing wrong in using abusive language against a woman.

 As the extreme right, placated and implicitly supported by the government, pushes its advantage and tries to take over the whole tent, it is once again the women of Pakistan who are standing up to it. A forceful statement was made in Karachi last Wednesday as hundreds of demonstrators ? men and women ? gathered to denounce the growing attacks on women. Ghinwa Bhutto of the Pakistan People?s Party (Shaheed Bhutto) echoed the sentiments of all those gathered when she asserted that Allah did not belong to the MMA or to men alone and that religion was not anyone?s property to be used at will. As one group of demonstrators chanted: ?Aik pakora tel ke andar Jaali mullah jail ke andar!?

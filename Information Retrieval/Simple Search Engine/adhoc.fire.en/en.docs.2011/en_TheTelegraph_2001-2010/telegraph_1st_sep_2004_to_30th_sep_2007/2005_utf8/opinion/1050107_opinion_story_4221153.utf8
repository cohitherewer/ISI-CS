 CASTING FOR GAIN

 In many parts of India, caste groups masquerade as political parties. Elections, therefore, become battles on caste rather than on political lines. This explains why the National Democratic Alliance government in Jharkhand is anxious to register some chosen castes as scheduled tribes before next month?s assembly elections. The state cabinet?s recommendation to this effect is clearly aimed at securing electoral benefits. For the government showed no particular concern for the welfare of these people in the past six years. The government?s action also shows how the caste groups put pressure on the ruling parties to try and extract privileges in exchange for political loyalty. It is thus a two-way traffic between the caste groups and the parties. The problem is that the parties ? such as the Congress and the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha ? which have opposed the government?s move have been just as guilty of divisive politics.

 There is a more fundamental injustice in the government?s move. The idea behind having the lists of scheduled castes and tribes was to help groups of people who had been underprivileged for historical reasons. The democratic state had an obligation to compensate for the social and economic inequalities under which these groups lived for centuries. Using these lists for political gains is thus a mockery of the democratic ideal which prompted them. Second, since the state?s resources are always limited, such devious manipulations of social groups would lead to depriving the most deserving sections. The case of the Kurmis in Jharkhand bears this out. Even the government would be hard put to argue that the Kurmis are among the most backward communities in the state. In fact, they are economically stronger than most other social groups. The move to register the group as a scheduled tribe is obviously an electoral ploy. The political gains from such games often prove doubtful. The damage they cause to social harmony is the real danger.

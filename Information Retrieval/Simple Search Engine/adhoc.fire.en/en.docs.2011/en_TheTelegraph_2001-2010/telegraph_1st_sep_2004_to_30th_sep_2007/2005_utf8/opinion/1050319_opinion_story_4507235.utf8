 THE MAKING OF A HERO

THIS ABOVE ALL / KHUSHWANT SINGH

 Manekshaw after the Bangladesh victory

 There is only one leader; the rest are led by him. National leadership in times of peace requires one kind of skill; military leadership, when a war breaks out, requires quite a different kind. A national leader has to sense what the people want and direct their energies towards that goal. Bapu Gandhi sensed that his countrymen wanted to get rid of foreign rule; so he gave them the means of fighting their powerful adversaries: satyagraha ? passive resistance. Pandit Nehru sensed that political freedom without economic self-sufficiency was not enough; so he gave the country the five year plans. National leaders have to do a lot of meeting people and speaking to them in a language they can understand. Though neither Gandhi nor Nehru were great orators, they could communicate with the masses. What they lacked in oratory, they more than made up with their charisma. People worshipped them.

 Military commanders do not have to meet many people nor orate to them. On the contrary, they have to work out strategies with a few senior officers who know their jobs and put them in operation in battlefields. The less they open their mouths, the better. They should inspire confidence in the men they lead so that they are willing to lay down their lives for them. This is true of military leaders of the last two centuries. Napoleon Bonaparte was a great strategist and was able to build the French empire in Europe before he had a setback in Russia. So was Wellington, who got the better of Bonaparte at Waterloo. World War I did not produce many great commanders but World War II produced a crop of very able generals ? Rommel on the German side, Montgomery on the British, Patton and Eisenhower on the American. 

 Since we attained independence, we have fought four wars: three against Pakistan, one against China. The short war against China was an unmitigated disaster, bringing disgrace on both our civil and military leadership. In our encounters with Pakistan, we more than held our own, inflicting a humiliating defeat on our adversaries in the Bangladesh war in 1971. It was in this 17-day war that our army (as well as our air force and navy) showed a carefully worked out strategy executed with military precision.

 A point that should be kept in mind about military leadership is that while soldiers and junior officers upto the rank of colonel have to lead their men from the front, senior officers issue orders from behind. The ones in front have to be brave; those at the back must have brains. When the two are combined, victory is assured.

 This brings me to a recent publication: Leadership in the Indian Army: Biographies of Twelve Soldiers by Major General V. K. Singh. He has done a good job by collecting biographical data of his heroes, both those who led from the front (Brigadier Usman, P.S. Bhagat, later General, who won the Victoria Cross in World War II) as well as India?s first chief of army staff, Field Marshal K.M. Cariappa, General K.S. Thimayya (the most amiable of the lot) and Field Marshal S.H.F.J. Manekshaw, who master-minded Indian victory in Bangladesh. 

 However, without belittling the achievements of his other heroes, I question the omission of some notable Generals like Harbaksh Singh, who turned the tide against Pakistan in 1965, and General Jagjit Singh Arora, who put in effect the strategy decided upon in 1971 war. Nevertheless, I recommend this compilation of soldier-leaders.

 A prayer most apt for civil and military leaders was written by Albert Holland:

God give us men

Men whom the lust of office does not kill

Men whom the spoils of 

office cannot buy,

Men who possess opinions 

and a will,

Men who have honour, men 

who will not lie.

 Favourite cocktail

 My oldest, closest friend Prem Kirpal died a few weeks ago at the age of 96. He left three wills. One, inviting his friend and relations to celebrate the occasion by drinking up his stock of liquor on the ninth day after his departure. The second was a poem on the transitoriness of life on earth to be read out that evening. The third was on the division of his assets among his relatives and servants. He died a bachelor.

 The family were sahejdhari (clean-shaven) Sikhs. So they had an akhand path (non-stop reading of the Granth Sahib for two days and nights). The kirtan was performed by raagis Nizambhai and his group, all five Muslims. For the first time, I heard a musical rendering from the Sikhs? morning prayer Japji. ?He was the truth when time began; he will be the Truth for time to come; He is the Truth today; O Nanak He will be Truth evermore.? This was followed by a soulful rendering of ?as a sunbeam mingles with the Sunlight, as water mingles with water, so the soul mingles with the Divine when life is over.? Prem?s nephew, Bhupinder Kirpal, retired chief justice of the Supreme Court, read out a tribute and thanked everyone present. As his oldest friend, I was asked to speak. I declined. His going had hit me very hard. I feared I would break down.

 It was different at his farewell party. I was determined to make it as cheerful an occasion as Prem would have liked. Here was a living example of a secular tradition, a mixing of Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims in paying tribute to the man who had all three in his heart and who mixed hard spirits with spirituality in equal proportions.

 A harmless question

 A passenger tapped the taxi driver on the shoulder to ask him a question. The driver screamed, lost control of the car, nearly hit a bus, went up on the footpath, missed a biker, scraped a fire hydrant, and stopped just three centimetres from a department store shop window. For a few seconds everything went quiet in the cab, then the driver slowly turned around and said, ?Look lady, don?t ever do that again. You scared the living daylights out of me!?

 The passenger apologised and said, ?I didn?t realize that a little tap would scare you so much.?

 The driver replied, ?Sorry, it?s not really your fault. Today is my first day as a taxi driver. I?ve been driving a funeral van for the last 25 years.?

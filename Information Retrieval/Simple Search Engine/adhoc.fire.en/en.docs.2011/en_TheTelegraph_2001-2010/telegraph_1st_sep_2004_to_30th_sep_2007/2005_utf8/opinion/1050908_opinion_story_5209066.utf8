 THE OTHER HALF OF THE SKY

 Women?s rights are a non-issue. Instead of trying so hard to reserve seats for women, Indian politicians should first try to eradicate poverty, writes Sumanta Sen

 Need some more?

 It is getting somewhat difficult to keep track of what really is going on about the bill to reserve seats for women in parliament. The original demand was that 33 per cent of the seats should be kept reserved for them, and the left still sticks to it. Then there is the new proposal to expand the size of the Lok Sabha so that the reserved seats do not cause any problems for the male members. All along, there has also been a demand for reservation within reservation ? that is, a sizeable portion of the reserved seats should be exclusively for women belonging to the backward castes ? a demand that was originally voiced by those following Mandal politics and now raised by Uma Bharti of the Bharatiya Janata Party.

 The monsoon session of parliament ended without the bill being presented in the house in any form. Actually, with so many contrary views, it is quite possible that the bill will remain a mere talking point for quite some time to come. The question to be asked is whether such a law is actually needed? The answer perhaps lies in an examination of the larger issue ? whether reservation is actually of any real help to anybody?

 Take the question of reservation of seats for scheduled castes and tribes. There are seats which can only be contested by people belonging to these communities. This has been going on for over fifty years, but how have the communities as a whole benefited? There are tribal MPs and MLAs aplenty in this country, but can it be anybody?s argument that because of them the lot of their brothers and sisters has improved? Or that if there were no reservation the government would not have paid any attention to them?

 Even then it may be argued that the tribals do need protection, but what about those who do not belong to the ?forward? castes? They are not only numerically much stronger than the tribals, economically also it is they who call the shots in the countryside. A Yadav or a Kurmi can be as exploitative as a Rajput or a Brahmin. That they are as much against progressive legislation is evident from the almost non-existence of land reforms in states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. When a poor backward votes for one from his community, does he really have any faith that the man or his opponents belonging to the same community will help ameliorate his grievances? 

 So at the ground level, how has reservation helped? In fact, reservation of jobs in government offices has actually had an undesirable impact on services as a whole. Reservation means absence of competition and that is never a good thing. It is indeed strange that those who are so keen to expose local industry to competition from abroad, should shy away from introducing competition in such a vital sphere of life as administration. Instead, there is a persistent call for more reservation. This is populism at its worst.

 Now to the question of reservation of seats for women. The argument is that this will bring to the surface in a larger way the problems faced by women. At the risk of being labelled an ?MCP?, this writer must confess that he fails to understand the logic behind this argument.

 The one and only problem facing this country is poverty. All other problems emanate from this. Now poverty affects both men and women, the latter are not the victims of any special kind of poverty. It is poverty that stands in the way of people being denied social justice, it is poverty that helps the continuation of such evil practices as dowry. Now how will more women in the house help deal with this problem? Can it be the argument of activists like Brinda Karat that their male comrades are unable to raise the issue of poverty in a big way and so more women are needed? India has had not only a powerful woman prime minister for long, but there have also been women chief ministers, and if even then the ?problems of women? have been not addressed, then 180 or 200 in the legislature will not help.

 The issue is not of caste or gender but of class. The struggle should be for the uplift of the poor, who should be seen as a single entity. A woman has no economic problems which her husband or father or brother does not share. As for empowerment of women, one would do well to remember that while in Britain women had to fight for their vote, the right was extended automatically to women in this country. As for the social scene, the rights of women cannot be guaranteed unless the rights of the whole community are upheld. Even poor women in rural areas or in the urban slums will agree with this.

 Reservation will mean a larger number of women legislators. There can be no problem with that. But will these additional members operate in a vacuum, that is to say, will they not be guided and controlled by this or that political party? That being the case, women will always function simply according to their party lines. That may not always help the ?women?s cause?.

 Also, from which segment of society will these women come? In a constituency reserved for women, the contesting parties will naturally look for candidates from among the articulate sections, which also means the well-off sections. To what extent will a woman belonging to such a segment be willing to voice the grievances of those who are less fortunate? Her class interest is bound to intervene. In any village, the women of the privileged class are as ruthless to the others as their men folk. Is one to believe that such women will behave differently on becoming a ?people?s representative?? 

 There is also the distinct possibility of class betrayal. Is a Mayavati today the true representative of her Dalit sisters? Or when Mamata Banerjee flung papers at the speaker, did she behave any differently from some of her male counterparts? Both questions can lead to the same answer: merely being a woman does not change anything. And in this case, a quantitative change may not lead to a qualitative change.

 Mao Zedong had said that women comprise half the sky and his words are often quoted by women?s activists. But what Mao had meant was that in the building of a new society, women had the same role to play as men. In India, the question is not of building a new society, it is one of survival with some relief. This struggle is being shared by both men and women and the latter know that the struggle will not become any less if more of their gender become members of parliament. And, as has been said earlier, when, and if, the struggle enters the phase of building a new society, the struggling women will be confronted with members of their own sex standing on the other side of the barricade.

 It is not as if such arguments are not known to the champions of women?s rights, particularly those belonging to the left. Yet they go on upholding what is essentially a non-issue because they must be seen as fighting for a cause. The merits of that cause or its justification seems to be of little importance to them. In the process, the class question is getting diluted. As for people like Mulayam Singh Yadav or Uma Bharti, they are neither interested in men nor women but only in pursuing their caste agenda without bothering to ponder over its disastrous consequences.

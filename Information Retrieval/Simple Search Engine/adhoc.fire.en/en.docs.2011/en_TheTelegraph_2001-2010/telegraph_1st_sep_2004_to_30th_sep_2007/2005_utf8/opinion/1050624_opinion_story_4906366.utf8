 CROOKED ROAD

 Peace initiatives rarely run along straight lines. The blast in Dispur shows once again how crooked the road to peace can be. It is irrelevant to split hair on the extent of the physical damage to buildings in the Assam government?s seat of power. The important questions are how big the damage is to the peace process and what it means for the road ahead. The blast, clearly the handiwork of the United Liberation Front of Asom, comes at a time when both the Centre and the state government were expecting the outfit to make sincere moves for peace negotiations. As such, it is obviously a major blow to that hope. It proves that, despite its peace rhetoric, there is little substantive change in the ULFA?s violent methods. In fact, the blast reflects an old strategy commonly used by north-eastern militants. It advocates violence as a tool to be used in order to force governments to negotiations. After over 25 years of armed insurgency, the ULFA should have seen the futility of this strategy. But, violence seems to have become the sum of both its means and ends. Even the ceasefires by other militant groups in the region have not done much to change the ULFA?s suicidal strategy.

 The blast, however, has important lessons for the state government and other agencies involved in the battle against the ULFA. The peace efforts are, in the ultimate analysis, in the larger interest of the state and its people. It would be a strategic mistake to end or even halt the peace process because of the blast. If the government makes the mistake, it would walk into the militants? trap. At the same time, the blast shows how dangerous it is to lower its guard. Unfortunately, the violence is the strongest evidence so far of the pathetically inadequate sense of that danger. If the militants could strike so close to the chief minister?s office, there must be something seriously wrong both with the security arrangements and with the attitude of people responsible for them. This perhaps is the biggest damage from the blast ? to the morale of the security establishment and to the people?s confidence in it. While he pursues the peace agenda, Mr Tarun Gogoi must clean up the mess within his administration. He must identify the people responsible for the security lapse and show them the door. After all, peace and security for the people must remain his first priority.

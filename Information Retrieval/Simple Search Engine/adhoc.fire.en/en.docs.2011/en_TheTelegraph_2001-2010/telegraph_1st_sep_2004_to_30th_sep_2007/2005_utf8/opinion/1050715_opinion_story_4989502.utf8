 THE FIST AND THE FURY

 NEHA SAHAY

 A man convicted of murdering his wife was given life imprisonment. Before his term could end, his wife was found, alive. During the trial, the man had ?confessed? that a corpse discovered near his house was that of his wife. After his release, the man accused the police of torturing him to get a confession. An inquiry was ordered against the policemen. One of them committed suicide.

 Soon after, a labourer who reportedly admitted murdering an acquaintance, was let off after his ?victim? turned up alive. Now a new law may come into force, disallowing police interrogation for more than 12 hours, since allegations of police torture have become frequent. All this in an avowedly totalitarian one-party state with no press freedom.

 Among the well off, the police are an object of ridicule, the subject of children?s comics. One depicts the adventures of a na?ve policeman who goes to buy a movie ticket. He?s given a free ticket and educated in the ways of his force by a cynical theatre staff, who advise him to occupy an entire row, with the one below his also kept vacant in case he wanted to answer nature?s call. ?The little red envelope must have done the trick,?? is the explanation when anyone gets away with an offence. It refers to the red envelopes containing cash given to children and subordinates on Chinese New Year.

 Mostly absent

 Outside one police station, the words, ?People?s Police?? were crossed out by local residents fed up of paying bribes. But there have also been policemen who?ve given up their lives trying to nab hit-and-run drivers, or save protestors who have chained themselves to rail tracks. Thousands have attended their funerals.

 The police are not a visible presence in South China. You see them sometimes whizzing past on motorbikes, coloured lights flashing, sirens blazing. This is a regular sight at night on Bar Streets and Lovers? Roads, with both lovers and police ignoring each other. Occasionally, you see them in action, frisking a cocky motor-bike rider, stopping a hawker from pushing his cart into a ?no-hawking zone?, pulling up a foreigner for taking a wrong U-turn. 

 But they are never around when the most audacious robberies take place: when mobiles are snatched at downtown bus stops in the afternoon or laptops stolen at crowded railway stations. They are probably busy elsewhere: detaining underground church congregations; arresting journalists; snooping in on workers? meetings; breaking up protests. 

 No harm meant

 One incident adds to the unfathomable behaviour of a police force indicted by human rights groups, operating in a society which neither tolerates dissent nor recognizes civil liberties. An elderly practitioner of the banned cult, Falun Gong, imprisoned for a year, was let off temporarily on health grounds after she argued her case personally in court. When the police came to re-arrest her a year later, her husband and neighbours surrounded them and asked for the warrant. They also pointed out that a factory-owner in the same town, who had closed down his factory and not bothered to pay the workers their dues, had been arrested and let off after just three days. Why then was ?this harmless grandmother? being taken away for another indefinite period? they asked. 

 The police informed the crowd that the court had ordered her re-arrest, as the trial remained incomplete. They asked her to come to the police station, and called for reinforcements. The accused and her husband went to the police station surrounded by police vans, waited there for the documents till their patience was exhausted, then walked out.

 Imagine a situation like this in India. Neither the husband nor the neighbours would have survived the police?s fury.

 PRICE OF DIVISION

 United, they could have stood tall; divided, they fell. The verdict in Bihar once again upheld the simple electoral logic. The true picture of the elections emerges in the arithmetic of the contending groups? vote shares. It was apparent that the division of the secular vote had been a major factor in the fall of Mr Lalu Prasad. But the numbers now not only confirm that assessment but also show how disastrous the division has been for the United Progressive Alliance. The secular democratic front, comprising Mr Prasad?s Rashtriya Janata Dal, the Congress, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Nationalist Congress Party, got nearly 32 per cent of the votes ? despite 15 years of the RJD?s misrule. Mr Ram Vilas Paswan?s Lok Janshakti Party and the Communist Party of India together polled another 12 per cent of the votes. If all these UPA partners and their communist supporters fought the polls together, they would have been ahead of the National Democratic Alliance of the Janata Dal (United) and the Bharatiya Janata Party, whose share of the votes was a little over 35 per cent. But the UPA should not use the figures to claim a false victory. It must see the verdict for what it is ? bad coalition politics and a failure to keep its flock together. 

 Managing a political coalition is tricky business even at the best of times. It becomes a major challenge when things go wrong. For the UPA, any serious attempt to control the damage must start with an acceptance of the failure. And, as the UPA chairperson, Ms Sonia Gandhi has to lead exercises to regain the lost unity. It was not the Congress?s fault that Mr Prasad and Mr Paswan, ministers in the UPA government, became sworn enemies in Bihar. The Congress could do little to prevent the two communist parties from going their separate ways in Bihar. But, if the Bihar battle exposed the UPA?s disunity, it could also serve as its wake-up call. The battle for Bihar was the first major trial of strength between the UPA and the NDA since the Lok Sabha polls last year. It was the BJP which has had seemingly unending problems within the party since its loss of power. The NDA too suffered a major setback in the Telugu Desam Party?s decision to quit the alliance. Coming to power in Patna would boost the sangh parivar?s sagging morale. For the UPA, though, it is a new threat. There could be worse days ahead for the UPA if its partners and the left fail to take the right lessons from the Bihar debacle.

 Letters to Editor

 Bitter harvest

 Sir ? The bombings in London have proved once again that no place is safe from the terrorists. But the British have only themselves and their foreign policy to blame for this state of affairs. They are the ones who supplied Osama bin Laden and his then fledgling group with arms in the late Seventies and early Eighties. Bin Laden?s al Qaida is not just a terrorist outfit anymore. It is a global phenomenon, the likes of which this world has not seen before. It has provided an opportunity to disgruntled Muslim youth all over the world to vent their spleen. Prime Minister Tony Blair and his cabinet should reflect on the plight of the innocent victims of the US-sponsored war in Iraq, Afghanistan and countless other nations. Their numbers certainly exceed the number of those affected by Thursday?s blasts.

 Also the world media, including the Indian press, has a habit of giving a lot of attention to disasters taking place in the first world. Similar situations in third world countries are ignored ? one only needs to look at the humanitarian disasters in Darfur and other parts of Africa for proof. The latter got lesser attention than they deserved, even though conditions there were worse than that in London.

 Yours faithfully,

Swayambhu Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? If you sow the wind, you will reap the whirlwind, goes the saying. It is time George W. Bush, Tony Blair and Co. realized that by attacking Iraq they have caught a tiger by the tail. Bush might believe in the maxim, ?might is right?, but the terrorists have proved that the mightiest weapon is the suicide bomber. As someone had once said, ?God made some men strong and some men weak. It took Col. Colt to invent the equaliser [the Colt revolver].? For Osama bin Laden, the jihadi suicide-bomber is the equalizer. Even if Bush is successful in eliminating bin Laden, there is no guarantee other bin Ladens will not crop up. If Bush is not na?ve, he will have observed that while the United States of America and the United Kingdom have been targetted, their anti-terrorism partner, Pakistan, has been singularly free from terrorist attacks.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? We in India have a set response to terrorist attacks. There is the usual noise by the opposition, the probing questions by the media, and not to forget, the vivid, brutal and gory pictures from the scene of attack. But take the BBC?s coverage of the London blasts. The channel was covering the scene right from the beginning. But there were no ghastly pictures of the dead or maimed, no smart questions from the media regarding the persons responsible for the security lapse, the action being taken, and so on. The opposition leader of the parliament rose to say that although the responsibility lay with the government, the opposition was ready to offer whatever help was required. The entire London population was disciplined. Although public transport services had been suspended, the media did not make much of the resulting difficulties of the people. There was no scramble or protests on the street at all. The casualty figures started emerging only 4-5 hrs after the incidents and slowly increased. Is there something in all this that our media, politicians and the public can learn from?

 Yours faithfully,

P.K. Shome, Rourkela 

 Sir ? For Indians, the bombings in London gave rise to a sense of d?j? vu. The West can never remain safe from the clutches of terrorism as long as they define it as the death of British or American nationals. When terrorists strike in Ayodhya, the best the world media can say is ?gunfight at a disputed religious site?. Such self-serving demarcations do not help in the long run. The West should realize that terrorism cannot be removed from ?their? world while it is allowed to flourish elsewhere.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Osama bin Laden?s al Qaida has outwitted the much-touted efficiency of the Scotland Yard and Federal Bureau of Investigation. There are, and have been, many deadly terrorist groups in the world, the Tamil Tigers, the Khalistan Liberation Front, the Basque separatist ETA, and the Irish Republican Army. Most of them operate within their geographical territory. But al Qaida is the only organization with a global presence. No state is beyond its reach. Its coordination, logistics and execution are awesome. Not since the days of Hitler has the world seen a more evil genius than bin Laden. If racism were Hitler?s toxin, bin Laden?s is Islam, and religion and terror are a dangerous cocktail. There is hardly any visible pattern in bin Laden?s modus operandi. Sometimes he fixes on hard targets like army camps, and sometimes on soft targets like temples and tube stations. It is not possible for any intelligence agency to gather prior information as al Qaida?s area of operations is global. It seems the seeds of hatred sown by Ayatollah Khomeni and nurtured by bin Laden have flowered throughout the world. 

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Das Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is time the people of England asked Tony Blair, who led them two years ago into an illegal invasion of Iraq, why it is possible for ?terrorists? to strike in the heart of London when security was at an all-time high for the G8 summit in Edinburgh. Blair, recently re-elected by them, owes an explanation also for why despite reported warnings from Israel about the attack days in advance, his administration had sat on them so as not to jeopardize the G8 summit or hurt London?s Olympic prospects. 

 Yours faithfully,

Biswapriya Purkayastha, Shillong 

 Sir ? Indian television channels have been taking a keen interest in the London blasts, but the terrorist attacks that take place on a daily basis in Kashmir do not get their due importance. Indian diplomats have for years been trying to make world leaders aware of the attacks on Kashmir. Had our news channels been more supportive, it would not have taken 9/11 and 7/7 for Bush and Blair to know the evils of terrorism.

 Yours faithfully,

Saurik Ginoria, Calcutta

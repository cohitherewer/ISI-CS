 UP ALL NIGHT

 The thought of equality is reassuring, the reality disconcertingly full of pitfalls. The Central government?s decision to remove the bar on women working on night shifts through an amendment to the Factories Act, 1948 establishes the principle of equal opportunities for women. This is to be the first in a series of reforms to the labour law. It kills two birds with one stone. While conceding to the demand for equal opportunities for women and inaugurating what has been called their increased contribution to the nation?s economic development, it can also help meet the demand for greater industrial productivity. Equality for women in this particular aspect of work seems to have come through an awareness of the need of the times. But it is possible to welcome the change without dwelling too long on the underlying ironies. It is a step towards increasing women?s earning power, especially in cases where there is overriding need. 

 But an abstraction promising mathematical perfection may begin to look quite different when removed from the universe of ideals. Since the need for increased productivity is as important as providing equal opportunities for women, there is always the possibility that night shifts may be made mandatory by employers. That would be consistent with the logic of equality. But women live rather different lives from men: equal work opportunities would not ensure equality in the home. A woman working night shifts may not be able to catch up on her sleep during the day as men do, because household and nurturing duties are not, and in many cases cannot be, distributed equally. There is also the issue of women with very young children. Without facilities for care, they may lose out on the opportunity being offered. The law, once promulgated, would look after women?s safety, security and dignity, but would it ensure that the employers do so? It is necessary to see that the law is so framed as to make sure that the new freedom is not twisted around into another exploitative tool ? that, for example, women unable to work night shifts do not lose their jobs. If the government is as serious about increased opportunities for working women as it is about productivity, then a law sensitive to social realities alone would effectively translate the concept of equality into the terms of a conflicted reality.

 Letters to Editor

 India abroad

 Sir ? With each passing year, the number and extravagance of the Indian film awards are on the rise. But they still manage to attract a huge following, and that is the last word in show business. The latest Bollywood extravaganza happened to be the IIFA awards in Amsterdam. But why Amsterdam? Yes, it is not the first time a Bollywood awards function has taken place outside India, but why can?t it be Indore, or Jamshedpur or Bhubaneswar? For one, it will generate jobs for local people, and surely, an Amsterdam can?t match an Indian city in terms of audience? What has happened is, the Bollywood variety shows today have taken the place of festivals of India of yesteryear. Sadly, those government-sponsored festivals tried to showcase the rich folk arts of our country, while the non-resident Indians? money fetches little more than some loud music and crude gyrations.

 Yours faithfully,

 Simi Lal, Calcutta

 Going by the book

 Sir ? One can only be encouraged by the decision of the French people to reject the European Union?s first constitution. The constitution promises to protect the status of religious communities in member states and pledges dialogue between political and religious institutions. But this is meaningless since the constitution has already, in its text, broken good faith with organized religion by deliberately failing to mention Europe?s Christian roots and identity.

 The road has now been paved for a democratic government that will authorize anything that any group in society asks for, as long as it phrases the request in the language of ?rights?. Ultimately, there will be anarchy. Already we have seen the nihilistic yet impeccably democratic result of such contemporary legislation involving life itself. I am thinking here of legislation ? such as the ones in the Netherlands ? that legalize various drugs, prostitution, homosexuality, same-sex marriage, abortion, euthanasia, and genetic manipulation.

 Also, there is widespread concern about moves, backed by Britain, towards Turkish accession to the bloc. From a historical and political point of view, Turkey has always represented another continent that is in permanent contrast to Europe and that, for this reason, should not be included in the EU.

 The constitution?s missing reference to Christianity shows an undervaluing of historical evidence and of European identity. One cannot cut one?s roots like this.

 Yours faithfully,

Paul Kokoski, Hamilton, Canada

 Sir ? The rejection of the European constitution by the people of the Netherlands and France is an indication of the power people still wield in the continent (?Voting on Europe?, June 11).The implications of this decision are many. It brings to the fore the beliefs and priorities of the people who feel that adopting the constitution would amount to sacrificing their identity. The people of these two countries have shown that they can never be taken for granted by the political leaders, eager to put into effect their grandiose plans. The message that has been sent to the rulers of each country is that the concerns of their own people must be addressed before the continent is brought into the picture.

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad

 Sir ? I thoroughly agree with the editorial, ?Nonplussed? (June 1), which correctly points out that after France, a leading member of the EU, rejected the common constitution, ?the constitution is as good as dead?. The reaction has just begun. Now its is going to spread fast to the other states of the EU. There is reason for saying this. Eastern European countries like Bulgaria, Romania and former Soviet republics fall into the category of ?developing? nations. Cheap labour from these countries will start flooding developed parts of the EU and create problems. The French and Dutch people seem to have anticipated this. A single constitution can only work for countries which have the same economic status.

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

 Water ways

 Sir ? The speaker of the Lok Sabha and the president of India have stressed the importance of rainwater harvesting. So far, the building of huge dams was the accepted method for this. But dams come with built-in hazards, and building and maintaining them is a costly affair. Instead, we should dig huge lakes, something like inland seas, of the magnitude of the great lakes in the US. Surplus water in the rivers during floods should be diverted to these lakes, which will act as reservoirs from which water can be drawn for irrigation and other civic needs. Their advantages over dams are ? no seismic hazards; generation of rural jobs; cheaper than dams. They will cause the water table in the surrounding areas to go up and give a boost to tourism and fishing industries. There have been talks of linking the rivers of India. Wherever possible, these lakes can be part of the river-linking plan

 Yours faithfully,

C.V.K. Moorthy, Calcutta

 OVERBOARD

 It is always interesting to see how authorities react to embarrassment. A gastro-enteritis infection that was detected first last Friday had affected 1500 people by Monday in Garulia in North 24 Parganas district. It is of some interest that inhabitants of the area had earlier informed the municipality that there was a danger of sewerage fluid entering the drinking-water pipe, because, they had found, the water was beginning to smell. Municipality officials had thought such fears beneath their notice. Even without such a warning, the sense of responsibility displayed by the municipality leaves much to be desired. There cannot be a sudden infection of such spread and proportion without something being thoroughly wrong with the system. The reaction of the municipality, conveyed through its chairperson, is typical. The situation is under control, there is no need to go overboard.

 By that logic, it would seem that a few deaths, more than a thousand ill, with 700 seriously so including children, is hardly a matter to worry about. As the various ministers of West Bengal have said at different points, after a series of babies? deaths in hospitals or starvation deaths in villages, these things happen. Irresponsibility and arrogance among elected representatives is no new thing. But it does become unnerving, even sinister, when they are manifested in the context of death and disease. Gastro-enteritis is one disease that is seasonally predictable and eminently preventable. Siliguri is facing a threat of an outbreak, but it seems that the administration was better prepared and is determined not to let the situation get out of hand. It is, therefore, a telling comment on the commitment of the municipality in Garulia, that people should actually be dying of the disease because it was quite indifferent to the dangers posed to its electorate by an endangered water supply.

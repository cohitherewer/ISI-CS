 Letters to Editor

 Service with a smile

 Sir ? In ?Slave, scab, pipe dream? (Nov 11), Ashok Mitra compares call centre workers to prisoners and slaves. But in doing so, Mitra seems to have forgotten that the former take up the job on their own accord, unlike the latter. The high attrition rate in the business process outsourcing industry bears testimony to workers making conscious choices about their careers. 

 One of Mitra?s contentions is that outsourcing takes place because importing migrant workers could result in their unionization. This is a preposterous argument as countries with whom India has the closest links in terms of outsourcing are among the least unionized in the world ? the United States of America and the United Kingdom. Mitra?s fear that the high unemployment rate in continental Europe might ring the death knell for India?s BPO boom is also unfounded. The reason why many European companies are doing well is because they have outsourced some of their operations to India. Sooner or later, other countries in the continent would follow suit, and Indian BPO companies would continue to prosper. Where else would these companies find thousands of computer-savvy, English-speaking workers ready at hand? 

 The success story of the BPO industry in India can be attributed to the fact that the government has not meddled in this sector. And if the revenues generated by the software industry is anything to go by, it seems unlikely that the government will do anything to hinder its growth. The real problem, however, with the BPO companies is the lack of awareness regarding the intellectual property rights of products and services outsourced. The companies simply develop an application for the end-user who takes over the copyright. If adequate attention is not paid to the IPR issue, Indian companies will continue to pay for purchasing applications that they develop, just as they are doing it now.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Ashok Mitra?s criticism of the BPO industry is applicable to other sectors as well. Outsourcing of cheap labour was prevalent in the manufacturing sector and in some other industries much before the BPO boom took place. Indians made bath towels and shoes for the Americans, besides supplying nurses, construction workers, teachers and researchers to many rich countries, including the Arab states. Indeed, slavery seems to have a long history in India. Muslim rulers who invaded the country made slaves of the local people. They were followed by the British who enslaved the entire nation for more than two centuries. Slavery in India was not limited to the export of labour; it also involved the import of obsolete ideas from the West. A large number of Indians still swear by failed philosophies like socialism and communism. This form of intellectual slavery is the most difficult to break. Mitra is right when he says that in the event of the US and Europe turning protectionist, Indian call centre workers run the risk of becoming slaves of the political masters in their own backyard all over again.

 Yours faithfully,

Basudeb Sen, Calcutta

 Sir ? In his otherwise brilliant article, Ashok Mitra misses a few points. He writes that ?American agriculture was, overwhelmingly, the product of imported slave labour.? This is only partially true. If imported slave labour was the sole reason behind America?s agricultural development, how is it that Australia and New Zealand managed to have flourishing farms without bringing in slaves from Africa or Asia? Or for that matter, why did Indian labourers fail to replicate America?s success in Mauritius and West Indies? The reason behind America?s thriving agricultural sector was the inherent skill of the European settlers, and nothing else. Furthermore, Mitra says that the wages of call centre workers in India are less than what is paid to employees in the West. It is a fact that salaries are low in the third world, which is why foreign companies are interested in outsourcing jobs. If they had to pay their workers salaries commensurate with that in the West,what is the point in outsourcing jobs to India and China?

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? That countries in the West outsource jobs for economic reasons is common knowledge. One would like to ask Mitra if he would use words like ?scab? and ?slavery? if communist countries were to do the same? What is wrong with outsourcing, especially if it provides jobs for the Indian youth? If Mitra does not have a problem with call centres producing quality goods, and then exporting them to markets abroad, he should have absolutely no reason to rant against the service providers. The income generated, apart from creating employment, goes a long way towards contributing to the country?s economic development.

 Yours faithfully,

A.K. Ghosh, Calcutta

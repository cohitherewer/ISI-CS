 HOPE FLOATS

 While the wrath of the tsunami was saddening, it did not dishearten. This comment, at the beginning of the president?s Republic Day speech, struck the note of restrained, sober optimism that was the dominant tone throughout. While mentioning the tsunami, the emphasis was on the seriousness with which the Central and state governments have engaged themselves in relief and reconstruction work. The gradual return to normalcy through reconstruction is the goal now, a task in which all citizens are involved. But the focus of the president?s speech was on employment generation, a subject he broached through a fable about the children he has met since he became president. Mr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam?s approach has always been marked by his concern for the young, who symbolize for him the future of the nation, and his eagerness that India should acquire a scientific habit of mind. Although the Republic Day speech is strictly formal, it was so constructed as to give the president?s approach full play.

 The upbeat note in the speech has much to do with the positive trends that the president could list, in the fields of the service sector, manufacturing and investment, for example, and in scientific research, particularly in the efforts to develop an anti-HIV vaccine. The employment pattern, according to the speech, needs to change most for the agricultural sector, where employment is falling. By 2020, employment in agriculture should be 44 per cent. In this context, the president emphasized the programme of providing urban amenities to rural areas, in terms of physical, electronic and knowledge connectivities. The president talked about using all available technology to make full use of resources, whether it be bio-fuel plantations on wastelands, or 100 per cent fly ash utilization from mining areas, or water harvesting and recharging. He also spoke of improving the more prosperous industries, textiles, and naturally, cotton, and expanding the media and telecommunications network to the remotest villages. Employment generation is the logical outcome of the society he envisages, but the full potential of social forces would be released only when the foundational principle is knowledge. What is heartening is that such a utopia does not sound entirely wishy-washy ? this is an optimistic phase in India?s career.

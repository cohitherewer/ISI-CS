 CLEAN, FOR A CHANGE

 Malvika Singh

 This is the first time in a long while that the two leaders at the helm of government and party have a reputation that is squeaky clean, supported by inherent integrity and morality, in the broadest definition of the words. For this reason alone, any aspersions that are cast on people within the cabinet, or close to the centres of power, must volunteer to step aside till proven not guilty, to strengthen the hands of those leaders who uphold the values that have, alas, become rare and unusual.

 Natwar Singh was always seen to be an honourable member of both the civil service and later, the Congress. He has been a member of the Nehru Memorial Trust et al and today, discredited because of certain revelations that involve his son and others, one expected he would not have dragged this issue through all its ramifications in this relentless manner, because with each passing day and television interview, he is tying himself up in unnecessary knots. Then, after Sonia Gandhi made her statement saying that she was angry, that he was a colleague, (read ? not close friend), and that the government would get to the bottom of all the allegations, Natwar Singh should have stepped out of the cabinet till all the investigations were over. By remaining in the cabinet, he will not be able to ensure a cover-up for anyone, including his son. The more appropriate thing to have done, as a close colleague of the prime minister and Sonia Gandhi, would have been to resign. It would have endorsed the integrity and correctness of his leaders and their truth.

 Surely, the Congress leadership must seek the political handling of such issues. To have parliament disrupted again at the cost of the tax- payer by an opposition ? in disarray itself ? would be ludicrous. Our public space has been so polluted and diseased that it will take strong action and setting of real examples to bring in correctives. Who better than Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi to initiate this reform, one that a majority of Indians desperately want? And you do not need to draft a ?bill? to ensure manners and good practice.

 Tribe mentality

 Talking of bills ? the bureaucrats in the PMO are furiously working away at cross-purposes with their boss, the prime minister, disallowing fruitful debate and a consensus on the final draft of the tribal bill. They are, as usual, affronted that they have been questioned. It is scary and in some ways, insidious, how the manipulations continue. Much like the strange report sponsored by the same PMO that saw in its wake hundreds of tigers killed as they fiddled about trying to compel predators and humans to cohabit, this tribal bill will, if passed in its present state, ensure lucrative business for land and timber mafias, and be responsible for creating deep animosity amongst other marginal communities living in the same areas. To ?correct? one wrong and forge another will discredit the prime minister. Such instances show the contradictions in the PMO, the vested interest groups at work that seem to be aiding, from within that exalted office, ?other? Congress factions that may be working behind the scenes against Manmohan Singh.

 Having to handle errant political colleagues and bureaucrats, Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi have to also handle the left. To coerce this government into fossil status, to arm-twist it into a time warp, to impose on it stale, predictable and, more often than not, redundant thinking, views and practice, and finally to make it operate dictatorially instead of in a democratic framework, is morally unacceptable. Blackmail, because of disagreements on policy, by a party outside of government, is just not on. Call their bluff. Play politics. Push them to join hands with the RSS, the other face of the dictatorial coin. The people will accept and nurture that true morality.

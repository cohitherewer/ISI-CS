 PART REFORM

 Pensions represent post-retirement income flows and should depend on individual contributions, as well as an appetite for taking risk. Individuals must have a choice in deciding contributions, in determining exposure to equity and in picking pension funds. That is not the way pensions have worked, with everything determined administratively. With ageing populations, pension reform and the broader issue of social security nets are on the agenda and this means the private organized and unorganized sectors too. But because pension reform has been driven by fiscal rather than conceptual logic, the trigger has invariably been government employees. Pension payments have contributed to the fiscal mess at the Centre and the states. This will worsen in the next 10 years. There is little that can be done to alter contractual obligations for existing employees, although it is possible to provide incentives for switching to new schemes. For new government employees, there was a scheme to link payments to contributions and risk-taking appetites, with competing pension funds allowed entry. The Centre and six state governments are doing this, and there are already 40,000 government employees who have opted for the new system. Each employee will have an individual retirement account and inflows will be exempted at contribution and accumulation stages, with outflows taxed at maturity. Private sector employees can opt for this new scheme and income tax benefits are expected in the next budget for those who switch.

 However, a Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority is needed to determine guidelines for entry of pension funds, to regulate intermediaries and decide norms for utilization of individual savings. Across two governments, no bill for setting up the PFRDA was placed before parliament. There is an interim body under the finance ministry, but it lacks the PFRDA?s powers. So, despite 40,000 employees having joined, their savings fetch an administered return of 8 per cent and the logic of pension reform has been turned on its head. Why the bill was not introduced in parliament, despite the cabinet having cleared it, is anyone?s guess. The government has now promulgated an ordinance setting up the PFRDA. But ordinances are second-best solutions. Yet in several instances, patents being another one, the government has resorted to ordinances. While this underlines lack of consensus on reforms, it also illustrates parliament?s inability or unwillingness to do what it is supposed to do, enact legislation.

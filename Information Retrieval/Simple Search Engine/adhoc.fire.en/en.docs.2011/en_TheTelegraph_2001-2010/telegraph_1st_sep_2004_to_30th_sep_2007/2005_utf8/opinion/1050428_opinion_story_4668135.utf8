 ROUND PEG IN A ROUND HOLE

 Gouri Chatterjee

 Newsrooms across the country are buzzing with the rumour. Jojo is changing his DNA. He has resigned. No he hasn?t. They?ve made him an offer but he hasn?t accepted it. Not yet, anyway. I don?t see him leaving the Times. Why should he, he?s on a strong wicket there? And certainly not to join a new paper like the DNA? 

 Jojo who, you may be wondering. Jojo, lesser known as Jaideep Bose, 43, is one of the most successful journalists in the country today but is barely known to the outside world, not even to his readers ? making him the quintessential 21st century editor every employer would love to have. 

 Sincere, hardworking, soft-spoken, intelligent, apolitical and faceless, Jojo, with a singleminded dedication to raising circulation figures, was a remarkable triumph as editor of Economic Times. So much so that it inspired his bosses to give him charge of their flagship Times of India last year, over the heads of such well-known bylines as Jug Suraiya and Bachi Karkaria. 

 Modern-day editors are not supposed to be seen or heard. Owners are rapidly discarding the mould created by M.J. Akbar and Arun Shourie and emulated by Prabhu Chawla, Shekhar Gupta, T.N. Ninan, Chandan Mitra, et al, of larger-than-life editors known instantly to their readers and to the newsmakers but often with agendas that may or may not tally with their owners?. (In fact, many in this list now have papers of their own.) 

 Nowhere in the world do owners want editors who are too well known and hence that much more difficult to contain. ?I love Andrew Neil,? someone once told Rupert Murdoch about his then Sunday Times editor. ?Editors should be like him, loud, opinionated, not afraid to get on TV and defend their papers and their stories. And he sets the agenda.? 

 The world?s biggest media boss pondered this for a few seconds and replied, ?Nah, editors should be anonymous and let their papers do the talking. Andrew is a good editor, he just doesn?t need to tell everyone that all the time.? Neil soon ceased to be a Murdoch editor. 

 Jojo would be a round peg in a round Murdoch hole. Till then, Times suits him to a T.

 A need for frost

 If it was ?wacky but wearable,? ?classic yet contemporary,? ?ethnic in construct yet global in appeal,? ?combined international styling with an Indian soul,? ?balanced creativity with commercialization,? it had to do with the India Fashion Week.

 The repertory of Indian fashion writers appeared to be as limited as that of the designers they gushed over. 

 Fashion can be serious business ? think money (a humungous Rs 25,000 crore, and that is just the growth in the branded apparel industry) and social change (the tale told by the disappearing sari say). But our media are happy to stick to entertainment only, a chance to show some skin legitimately and bag some easy eyeballs. 

 So the coverage of Fashion Week was exhaustive but nothing more than endless mush by pretty young things totally in awe of the designers and their clients. Imagine a rookie being sent to cover a BJP chintan baithak or the CPI(M) congress and you get the picture. When will we get our Anna Wintour, the famously frosty Vogue editor designers love to fear?

 Faustian bargain

 It?s difficult to feel for the Beckhams. A British judge has practically ruled that they have no right to any privacy at all, that anything about their lives is fair game for the press, however they come by it. But that is part of the Faustian bargain the duo made when they decided to exploit their relationship as much as their talents to make their fortunes.

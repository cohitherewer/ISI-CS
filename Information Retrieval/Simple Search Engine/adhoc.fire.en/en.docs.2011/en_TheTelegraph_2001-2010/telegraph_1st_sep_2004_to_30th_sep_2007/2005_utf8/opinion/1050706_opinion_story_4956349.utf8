 COSMETIC CHANGES ONLY

 Raju Mukherji

 Will Sunil Gavaskar and his committee members please explain how the recent changes in rules will make cricket more exciting? Having 12 men instead of 11 will merely give the captain the option to take an additional batsman when batting and an additional bowler when bowling. Thus from now on, every team will have seven batsmen including the wicket-keeper while batting and then replace one batsman and have five bowlers while bowling. How does the game become any more exciting?

 Similarly with field restrictions. Until now, the field restrictions of two players beyond the 30-yard mark were in place for the first 15 overs. From now on, that restriction will be limited to the first 10 overs and then for two blocks of 5 overs each, at the discretion of the fielding captain. There is hardly anything to be said in favour of these recommendations. Moreover, in truncated or rain-affected matches, there will be utter confusion.

 As for the existing restriction of having two close-in fieldsmen in stationary positions in the first 15 overs, it has now been changed to 10 overs. Will the committee please give the rationale behind these changes? 

 As for graphite not to be used in cricket bats, what is the confusion all about? The existing rule in cricket is very clear: the bat is to be entirely of wood, with a breadth of four and quarter inches. The question is, why did the International Cricket Council allow Ricky Ponting to use graphite in his bat for so long? 

 If the ICC committee feels that by having 12 men instead of 11, it is doing something novel, it is sadly mistaken. Years ago, the Indian maharajahs would bat but not field. They would have someone else take their place not only to field but also to bowl.

 No rules for rulers

 The Maharajah of Natore was famous for having his Natore XII take the field ? there would be 12 players in the team but only 11 would field. This he did even against Ranjitsinhji, who had come to play for the Jodhpur-Jamnagar team at Natore Park in Calcutta in 1910.

 Twelve cricketers have played for a first-class cricket team in India, in contravention of existing cricket norms and laws. In the inaugural Irani Trophy tie between Ranji Trophy champions, Bombay, and Rest of India, played at the Railway Stadium in New Delhi between March 18 and 20, 1960, the Rest of India team played with 12 men.

 The skipper of Rest of India was none other than the stormy petrel of Indian cricket, Lala Amarnath. He opened the bowling, and bowled 11 overs for 27 runs and one wicket. Later when his team batted, Lala did not bat. Instead he sent in the 12th man, Prem Bhatia. The umpires-?K.B. Saxena and S.K. Bhattacharya ? objected, but were over-ruled by Amarnath. It is said that officials of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, including the president, were also present on the ground. Later, both umpires went on to officiate in international matches.

 It appears that the ICC committee is bereft of ideas. With these changes, it is only complicating the rules, unnecessarily juggling around with technicalities. Moreover, the new rules are applicable only to international matches for a certain period ? different rules would apply at other levels. This is ridiculous. Whatever the rule, it should apply to all levels and all over the world.

 Herein lies the weakness of the ICC, in relation to FIFA. The football organization is very thorough and very certain. Its rules are simple and apply to all levels all over the world, and it encourages no unnecessary changes. 

 And to think that it is the ICC which is indulging in this unnecessary meddling, the very same body which has allowed players to get away with bribery, betting against one?s own team, drug abuse, chucking and other misdemeanours.

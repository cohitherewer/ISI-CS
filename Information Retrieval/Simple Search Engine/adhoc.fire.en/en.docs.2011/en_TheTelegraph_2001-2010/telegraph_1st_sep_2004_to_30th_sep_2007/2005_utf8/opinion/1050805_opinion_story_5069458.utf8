 WHY THE RAINS KILLED

 MALVIKA SINGH

 As the rains whip Mumbai and a substandard municipal infrastructure causes damage and grief to the people of that city and Maharashtra, the reality of years of corrupt practices, of breaking all the norms at the behest of vested interest groups, builders and politicians has been exposed. Prominent citizens have begun their active protest and hopefully the politician and the babu will be pronounced guilty. Maybe it is time for the courts to intervene and compel a reversal of all the contaminated decisions that have reduced Mumbai to a slum. It is as though the gods have had enough of the indecent shenanigans, motivated by greed, indulged in by those who rule us. It was a comic sight seeing politicians and administrators in ?boats? on the main arteries of India?s commercial capital. May the failed leaders and their operatives, the babus, be brought to book for having relentlessly broken all environment rules that they themselves had instituted. 

 While India?s commercial capital was reeling under this trauma, one daily newspaper was terribly concerned with the fact that Amitabh Bachchan had not had a bath for three days! Who cares? And does his not bathing make national news? Does it merit being a lead story? Is that where our priorities are? Have our daily newspapers become putrid tabloids? Are the owners of the media unconcerned with the real issues that confront India? It is just plain absurd and intellectually embarrassing to have a serious national daily juxtapose Bachchan?s bath with the death toll of nearly one thousand persons, for the same reason, on its front page. Let?s hope we don?t have a story about Shri Bachchan?s constipation. 

 Paradise within

 After the tsunami, it was clear that the disaster was hugely aggravated because of the defiance of environmental norms. The same goes for the flooding in Mumbai. Land mafias have manipulated governments to destroy mangroves that protect the land from an angry sea. Some months ago the rules were about to be bent yet again to ?accommodate? a commercial developer who wanted to build a ?city? where mangroves flourished. The permission was stalled by an IAS officer who was brought into the Central ministry of environment as additional secretary and who was unceremoniously shunted out for not allowing the rules to be broken. 

 Amidst all these negatives I met a young businesswoman who is setting up projects in West Bengal. She described the ease with which things move there, the accessibility of the bureaucracy, the quick decision-making processes, the rapid movement of the permissions and files and no crude political interventions. This was heartening. Clearly the CPI(M) government in West Bengal is not joined at the hip with some members of its politburo based in New Delhi!

 Then there is the other face of that coin. P Chatterjee and his problem with Haldia. It appears as though the political bosses in Calcutta and Delhi are in cahoots with each other playing public sector against private sector, a jig that is bound to spoil the environment for international investment in the state. Why are we constantly doing the Indian samba of two steps forward, five steps back? Why has consistency ceased to have a place in our policy and decision-making? I sometimes wonder if our rulers want India to not move ahead in case their fragile positions are threatened by change, new energy and ideas. 

 Images of our parliament in session are scary. They foreshadow the future of this country, its democratic framework and the calibre of its leadership. Unruly and often farcical, these absurd enactments have to be paid for by the tax payers. Misuse of money, privilege and power is what defines our parliament. These men and women are setting the standards for India. They are compelling this country to regress.

 Letters to Editor

 Jobs for all

 Sir The national rural employment guarantee bill, passed by parliament 

recently and which envisages giving jobs to at least one person in a poor family 

in 200 districts of the country, is Sonia Gandhis dream project and will 

cost Rs 60,000 crore. But where will the money come from? The government is already 

hard put to find the money to pay salaries and pensions. Such an ambitious programme 

may make popular sense but it is bad economics. While Sonia Gandhis economic 

leanings are unknown, her actions seem to indicate that she is closer to the leftist 

mindset. One can feel sorry for Manmohan Singh, with no political base of his 

own and a prisoner in the hands of the Marxists and opportunists in his own party. 

Such a situation does not augur well for the country.

 Yours faithfully,

 Tapan Das Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir Reading Pratap Bhanu Mehtas Economists 

 dont argue (Aug 18), I couldnt help wondering 

 why, if the left was really so keen to implement the employment 

 guarantee scheme, it had not brought in something similar 

 even on a modest scale in West Bengal, the 

 state in which they have been in power for 27 years now? 

 They very well know that like West Bengal, the Centre too 

 does not have the money to implement the scheme. Hence their 

 insistence on the scheme seems to be a publicity stunt designed 

 to depict them as champions of the poor. The left should 

 practise what it preaches.

 Yours faithfully,

 Asoke C. Banerjee, Cambridge, US

 Sir One positive fallout of the national rural employment 

 bill may be to check the ever-increasing migration from 

 villages to cities. This will definitely ease the burden 

 that such migration puts on civic amenities in cities. But 

 in India, where corrupt political leaders swallow most of 

 the funds meant for public welfare schemes, it is doubtful 

 whether the real purpose of the scheme will be fulfilled. 

 The United Progressive Alliance chairperson and the prime 

 minister should first concentrate on eliminating corruption 

 in the country before giving huge sums of money to local 

 bodies for such innovative schemes.

 Yours faithfully,

 Subhash C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Monkey business

 Sir The Union aminal welfare ministry may have rejected 

 a proposal by wildlife officials in Himachal Pradesh to 

 kill monkeys with poison to contain the simian menace in 

 Simla and other towns in the state, but the fact that the 

 proposal was made at all speaks volumes about the mentality 

 of the people given the task of conserving our forests and 

 wildlife (Monkeys escape massacre, Aug 28). 

 No wonder reserve forests like Sariska have become the graveyards 

 of tigers. 

 Himachal Pradesh is endowed with unparalleled natural 

 beauty and thousands of tourists, Indian and foreign, descend 

 upon Simla, Kulu, Manali every year. And there is no denying 

 the fact that the monkeys add a special flavour to the hills 

 by their antics. Without them the towns and hills would 

 appear lifeless. However, if the simian population has grown 

 so much as to become unmanageable, options like relocation 

 and neutering the males could easily solve the 

 problem. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Shivaji K. Moitra, Kharagpur

 Sir The Assam government should first pay attention 

 to the upkeep of the Orang National Park instead of renaming 

 it the Rajiv Gandhi National Park (National park in 

 name game, Aug 29). The park is the pride of Assam 

 and its people and what it needs is maintenance and protection 

 of its rich flora and fauna. Had Rajiv Gandhi even heard 

 of the Orang National Park? And even if he had known about 

 it, did he ever take an interest in it?

 Yours faithfully,

 Ranjan K. Baruah, Guwahati

 Sir Has anyone ever wondered why there are so many 

 stray cats, dogs and oxen on Indian streets but no stray 

 chicken or goat? The answer is simple. Economics. Chicken 

 or goat can be eaten, and thus have good economic value. 

 So, people prefer to rear them, or cook and consume them 

 if they do spot a stray one. The most effective way to control 

 the cattle menace is not to catch them and hand them over 

 to the municipal pound, and spend days in the hope of the 

 elusive 

 Rs 2,000 (No fodder for capital cowboys, Aug 

 7). If we can encourage people to eat beef, the menace of 

 cows roaming our streets will soon disappear. The streets 

 of New York or Dhaka, I am sure, have no stray cattle. It 

 is what is called natural control.

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Pal, Batanagar

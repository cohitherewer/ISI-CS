 Letters to Editor

 Heart of darkness

 Sir ? This is the 21st century, and we call ourselves modern. But wonder of wonders, there are still a few who prefer to embrace stone-age customs. Take the king of Swaziland, who chose his 13th bride from over 50,000 bare-breasted virgins recently (?Virgins vie for king?s eye at reed dance?, Aug 30). And this in a country where 40 per cent of the population is HIV positive. It may not be politically correct to use the epithet ?dark continent? for Africa, but what can be done if some people refuse to see the light?

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The United Progressive Alliance government?s decision to give away five million dollars of Indian public money to American Red Cross for relief activity in the American states hit by Hurricane Katrina is ethically unacceptable. The American Red Cross is very different from official India?s illusion or imagination of what it is. Charges of corruption in the American Red Cross predate its September 11 windfall. Its branch in Hudson County of New Jersey was in the news when there were allegations that its local officials had pocketed as much as one million dollars donated by the people for worthy causes. It is to such an organization that the Manmohan Singh government has thrown away as much as five million dollars of Indian taxpayers? money.

 It is surprising that officials of the Indian embassy in Washington did not alert New Delhi about the scandalous record of the American Red Cross before such a huge amount was deposited with the organization. The only explanation could be that with the frequent change of diplomats posted in Washington, no one knew or remembered about the ill-repute of the American Red Cross.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? It seems that the Indian government is hellbent on not learning from its past mistakes. It has jumped the gun again, loading relief material a little too hurriedly on to the Indian Air Force plane for the hurricane-ravaged state of New Orleans in the United States of America. In its hurry to act as a great comrade to the US, the North Block readied the plane and relief even before getting the necessary clearance from the US. The result: the pilots and crew were all geared up with nowhere to go. Although the clearance has finally arrived and the plane sent off, the episode has left many in the government red in the face. 

 But our external affairs ministry is too thick-skinned to be bothered with this goof-up. Even more surprising, it did not feel snubbed when the US government spokesperson failed to acknowledge the Indian contribution. It is time for the government to stop being such a sycophant when it comes to the West. A nation of over a billion people should behave in a more mature manner.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Sending 5 million dollars as aid to the victims of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans is not necessarily a good thing. The gesture must be seen in perspective. Less than three years ago, the US invaded Iraq, a sovereign country, killing thousands of innocent people for no plausible reason. For this single crime against humanity, the US should be refused help by the rest of the world. Besides, did the Indian government ask permission of the people whose money it is spending on the subjects of one of the richest countries of the world even as its own people are dying of hunger? Recently, Rs 1,000 crore was spent in procuring luxurious aircraft for the prime minister. Should we still dream of people?s welfare?

 Yours faithfully,

Diptendu Chakraborty, Toronto

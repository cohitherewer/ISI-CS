 Paperback Pickings

 Other times, other places

 SERVANT MASTER MISTRESS (IndiaInk, Rs 395) by Boman Desai is not a translation of Bimal Mitra?s Saheb Bibi Golam. It is a novel set in raj India ? told from the other side of the fence. But the Sanjanas of Navsari, ?a few hours north of Bombay by train?, are closer in spirit to the rulers than the ruled. Dolly Sanjana, the matriarch, ?had become a Sanjana twice: first when she had married Kavas, and again, after Kavas?s death, when she had married his younger brother, Savak?. The triangle comes back to haunt the family when Daisy, the elder son?s wife, catches the fancy of the younger son. Dolly is scared the tension, echoing the rivalry between her two husbands, would erupt. Predictably, the two sons are called Sohrab and Rustom. The novel tells how the Sanjanas get reconciled to the dark crevices of their past.

 STEEL RAIN (Headline, ? 2.99) by Tom Neale is one of the many thrillers spawned by 9/11. But this has a domestic angle: an FBI agent posted in London watches his daughter being blown up in front of a bookshop. The policeman?s personal life and mental state are as much part of the story as the ups and downs of the chase. Complete with an irate ex-wife and two glamorous new female friends, a professional crisis and a major red herring, this is a racy, nicely puzzling book.

 The Manticore?s Secret (Penguin, Rs 295) by Samit Basu is the second novel in the GameWorld trilogy, the final one already pouring out of Basu?s pen (no, it is probably keyboard). The interesting thing about GameWorld is that one is never quite sure whether good and evil are exactly that. What makes the series enjoyable is the humorous tone that is sustained throughout. Sample this: ?Kirin...had launched an innovative scheme for asur social reform...where asurs imprisoned in the dungeons... could learn a skill or philosophical concept and earn their freedom by passing an examination.?

 My Way (Card Box, Rs 100) by A. Joseph Antony with Jayanthi Jaisimha is the biography of M.L. Jaisimha, the maverick cricketer. Not a great literary achievement, the book still manages to show how cricket has lost colour in direct proportion to its gain in money. There are plenty of anecdotes, even about ?Jai?s? wild outings, smoking-tippling sessions and his way with female admirers, besides an endearing account of their courtship by his wife, Jayanthi.

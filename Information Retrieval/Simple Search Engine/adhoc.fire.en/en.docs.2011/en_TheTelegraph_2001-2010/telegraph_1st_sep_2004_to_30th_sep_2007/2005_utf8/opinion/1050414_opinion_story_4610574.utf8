 TURNING A NEW PAGE IN THE RED BOOK

 Under its new general-secretary, the CPI(M) will ensure that it is New Delhi?s line that prevails over the state units, argues Ashis Chakrabarti

 Old wine in new bottle

 It is routine for all political parties to say that the party is more important than the leader. It has generally been so for the communist parties in India. The Communist Party of India even expelled S.A. Dange, its chairman. In the Communist Party of India (Marxist), one general-secretary, P. Sundaraya, had to quit over differences with the party. Another, Harkishen Singh Surjeet, offered to quit twice ? following debates in the party over joining the government at the Centre ? but was not allowed to do so. 

 So, will things be the same under Prakash Karat, who has now replaced Surjeet as the CPI(M)?s general-secretary? The party?s leaders give you the predictable answer. It is all a question of collective leadership, they say. It would be wrong to dispute that as a guiding principle, but it would be na?ve not to expect some changes in the CPI(M)?s way of things under Karat. 

 Remember that Karat was the politburo member who led the group in the central committee that frustrated moves by veterans like Surjeet and Jyoti Basu to persuade the party to join the Union government, first as the leader of the United Front in 1996 and then as a partner in the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance last year. Even when Basu, as West Bengal?s chief minister, began accepting a more liberalized economic policy, it was Karat who often pulled him back. 

 It is true that the CPI(M) has had a major shift on economic issues in recent years and has come to accept the crucial role of private investment and even global capital in many areas of the economy. The shift is best seen in Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s pro-reform agenda, which has been many steps ahead of what Basu had started. But, as the conference of the West Bengal unit of the party in February showed, the battle within the party on economic reforms is far from over. There still is a sizeable section in the Bengal party which thinks that the party?s political ideology must not be sacrificed at the altar of capital-driven development. It is not that the importance of Bhattacharjee?s development agenda is not appreciated by this section. But it is opposed to the idea of the development strategy replacing the politics of mass action, which has always been central to the CPI(M)?s policy. If Bhattacharjee faces such sceptics at home, it is no wonder that there are many more of them in other states, where the party?s growth depends entirely on its capacity to mobilize mass agitations. 

 This section of the party has more reason to be happy with Karat?s ways than Bhattacharjee?s. And this impression is strengthened, not just by his past record but by what he said immediately after being elected general-secretary. Karat?s remarks should leave little doubt about the shifts in economic and political strategies that he will try to bring about. 

 Karat has made it clear in newspaper interviews that the party?s position on economic issues may harden further. ?While fighting liberalization was always part of our agenda, the emphasis on this aspect would be more now,? he said in one such interview. The new line is to accept foreign capital only if it augments ?the existing productive capacities in our economy?, upgrades the economy ?technologically? and leads to ?employment generation?. In other words, the party wants a check on the free flow of such capital. 

 The important thing to note is that he got the party congress to approve this line even before he took over. So it would be wrong to see it only as Karat?s line; this is going to be the party?s line for the next three years. The theoretical basis for it has been laid down in the document, ?On Certain Policy Issues?, which was part of the all-important political-organizational report of the congress. It talks of the threat that neo-liberal policies under globalization pose to, as Sitaram Yechuri put it, ?the economic sovereignty and thereby also the political sovereignty? of India. It also sets guidelines under which Left Front governments can make use of global capital and foreign assistance. 

 It does not mean that Bhattacharjee cannot get such capital or assistance at all. But it means that he will have to stick to the party guidelines hereafter. This, in effect, means that each such proposal will have to be vetted by Karat and his colleagues in the politburo. And, there can be no doubt that some proposals will be vetted and others vetoed. It once happened with Basu ? Karat getting the politburo to shoot down the then West Bengal chief minister?s proposal for an amusement park project offered by Warner Brothers. Foreign capital and that too for an amusement park ? it was simply a no-no for Karat?s team. A sign of the new party regime?s leash on Bhattacharjee comes in the way the party congress shot down the idea of foreign direct investment in retail business. Recently, Bhattacharjee spoke in favour of FDI in retail and was actually trying to bring such investment for West Bengal. Not just foreign capital, the party?s new line intends to restrict the role of NGOs and self-help groups as well. 

 The ideological shift comes out sharply if one compares the document, ?On Certain Policy Issues?, with another that West Bengal?s commerce and industries minister, Nirupam Sen, presented at the West Bengal conference of the party. Sen?s report, ?Left Front Government and Our Tasks?, had spoken of the need to extensively involve the private sector in the government?s development agenda and also advocated the role of NGOs and self-help groups in implementing programmes in primary education, healthcare, sanitation and small rural welfare projects.

 The party documents and the congress made it amply clear why a new position on the economic issues was necessary. Every congress of the CPI(M) sets its tasks for the next three years, after which the performances are assessed and analysed at the following congress. At the 17th congress in 2002, the party set itself the primary task of defeating the ?communal? Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies in the 2004 general elections. To achieve it, the party put forward the tactical line of electoral adjustments with the Congress. 

 With that goal achieved with the defeat of the National Democratic Alliance and the installation of the UPA government, the 18th congress in New Delhi has now projected the fight on the economic issues as its main task in the next three years. So, even as the realities force it to accept globalization and economic liberalization, the party has no doubt that the same realities bring in new hardships for the common man and, therefore, offer new opportunities for mass politics. It was crucial, therefore, to show that the party?s line prevailed on Bhattacharjee as well. As Yechuri remarked, the new document should end all doubts about a difference between what the CPI(M) preaches in New Delhi and what Bhattacharjee practises in Calcutta. There is no scope for any further confusion ? it is New Delhi?s line that will prevail everywhere in the party. It is not as if Karat does not know the importance of Bengal in the party?s scheme of things. After all, the leaders in New Delhi owe their political status and relevance to the party?s success in Bengal. But the party?s compulsions in Bengal cannot be the basis for the party?s overall political strategy. 

 Karat himself has suggested that this will indeed be the new style of leadership. For several years, the CPI(M) had been worried over the ?federal tendency? in the party, which prompted powerful state units ? like the ones in West Bengal and Kerala ? to go their own way and take the central leadership almost for granted. The leaders at the ?party centre? struggled to put down the tendency. Karat wants to set up a central secretariat. It would be the first such structure in the party. Its aim would be to strengthen the party centre and allocate functions to the politburo members. The effect, however, would be further consolidation of the politburo?s control over the party. 

 The party congress linked the focus on economic issues and the strengthening of the party centre to its new organizational challenge. A major thrust of the congress was the party?s expansion across the country. It identified five priority states ? Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Assam and Maharashtra ? for its expansion drive in the next three years. Unlike in West Bengal, where Bhattacharjee?s development agenda has become the party?s political strategy as well, the party has to depend on mass movements elsewhere. And the movements will be primarily on economic issues because, in the party?s view, the new economic policies are increasingly pushing the poor people to the brink. Only a strong party centre can coordinate and guide such movements across the country. 

 This is not the first time that the CPI(M) has planned an expansion in different parts of India. But this now will be Karat?s main challenge. He wants a return to ideology and mass politics in order to achieve this. But the ideology also needs to be married to Indian social realities. The party can no longer ignore caste and talk solely of class. It has to take up issues that the Dalits face as Dalits, even as it continues to see them as an economic class. 

 Finally, the CPI(M) under Karat is likely to revive the idea of a ?third front?. However, it depends on how far the party succeeds in expanding in different states. After the failure of the United Front, leaders like Surjeet and Basu have been dismissive about talks of reviving a third front. They wanted the party to move closer to the Congress, even if for tactical reasons. The CPI(M) under Karat may not rush into adventurist ploys to topple the UPA government. But it may gradually shift away from the Congress and try to do its own thing.

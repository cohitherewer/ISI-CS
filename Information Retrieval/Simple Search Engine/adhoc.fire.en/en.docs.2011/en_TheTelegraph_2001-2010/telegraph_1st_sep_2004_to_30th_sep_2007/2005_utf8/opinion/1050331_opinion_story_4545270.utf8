 Waiting to be ravaged

 Sir ? What would have happened if the tsunami had really struck the Indian coast on the night of March 29? It did not, and thank god for that. For there is little to show that our governments and authorities were any more prepared for a tsunami last Monday than they were on Boxing Day last year (?Tsunami scare strikes?, March 29). It is one thing to have bodies and institutions to forecast natural calamities and arrange for precautionary measures. But it is quite another to actually sound the warning bell, and act on a war footing immediately after that. Bodies and agencies with complicated names India has no dearth of, but we never seem to have that degree of preparedness which is required to combat a calamity of the order of a tsunami. And, why, barely three months after one devastating tsunami, do we, in south Asia, still have to be warned by American monitoring agencies?

 Yours faithfully,

K.P. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Beastly tales

 Sir ? During a recent trip to India, I had an opportunity to visit the Calcutta zoo. At first sight, the zoo appeared rather lush and natural, but closer examination revealed that virtually all of the animals experienced completely artificial, unnatural, and substandard conditions. During the past 20 years, I have reviewed conditions in hundreds of zoological facilities in more than a dozen countries. While these facilities have been a mix of good and bad, old and new, most of the Calcutta zoo exhibits were outdated and desperately in need of attention. They did little to satisfy the biological and behavioural needs of the animals they contained. For example, the grossly undersized, cell-like big cat exhibits were the antithesis of modern, humane big cat housing. Not only did they lack any kind of furnishings or enrichment to keep the cats occupied, they were deficient in every other respect as well (for instance, inappropriately hard floor surfaces, lack of privacy, not enough shade, and so on). Most of the cats were lethargic and obese. These kinds of cages should not be in use today and should be dismantled.

 Many of the other exhibits were poorly designed, undersized, barren and in need of refurbishment. In fact, many exhibits at the Calcutta zoo represent the worst that zoos have to offer. The reptile house was particularly problematic and one of the poorest I have ever witnessed. A variety of reptilian species representing a range of habitat types were displayed in uniform, glass fronted, hard floored, barren exhibits. The animals had no opportunity to engage in species-typical behaviour or even to obtain any privacy from the prying eyes of the public. I observed one very large, distressed-looking monitor lizard vainly trying to move about on a slippery, hard, tiled floor, in a cage that lacked suitable light, ventilation, temperature, privacy, furnishings and just about anything else that a monitor lizard in captivity would need.

 What is particularly sad about this situation is that a great deal can be done in the short term to alleviate the distress experienced by the animals. Introducing natural earth areas, branch piles and browse, logs to pull apart, ropes and climbing apparatus, hiding boxes, animal skins and carcasses for the big cats, play objects and alteration of feeding regimes are just a few of the interim, low-cost measures that can be employed to increase the comfort levels of the animals. These and other strategies should be instituted immediately. Over the long term however, the Calcutta Zoo needs to be radically changed. Large animals such as elephants and rhinos should be moved out to more appropriate, spacious accommodation elsewhere and the space allocated to those animals that remain increased. New enclosures and better conditions must be created and the zoo staff must be better trained in how to care for and manage the animals. Proper organized educational programs should be developed, and support for wildlife conservation in the field provided. I encourage the Calcutta zoo management, staff and members of the public to do everything possible to bring the zoo out of the dark ages.

 Yours faithfully,

Rob Laidlaw, project manager, World Society for the Protection of Animals, Toronto

 Sir ? Horses are magnificent creatures. But, they are put through unnecessary stress, made to gallop at speeds that strain their cardiac muscles and often lead to their collapse ? just to feed man?s arrogance and greed. If the government can enforce a ban on the harmless Playwin lotteries, why can?t it impose a ban on horse racing? The former type of gambling does not take lives, but horse-racing brings no end of harm on these wonderful creatures. Animal rights bodies and individuals should strongly protest against such forms of bloodsport.

 Yours faithfully,

Nelson Petrie, Darjeeling

 Sir ? The prime minister must be thanked for taking notice of the plight of our tigers and directing the CBI to probe their diminishing numbers. This will probably be the first case the CBI can investigate in peace, without facing interference from politicians.

 Yours faithfully,

Siddhartha Raj Guha, Jabalpur

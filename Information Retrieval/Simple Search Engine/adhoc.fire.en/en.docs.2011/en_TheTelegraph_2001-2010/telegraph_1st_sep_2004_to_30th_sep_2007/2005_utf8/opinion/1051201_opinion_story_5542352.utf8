 PARTY ENCOUNTER 

 There seems no easy way of return to glory. For Ms Uma Bharti, the exultation of victory by a three-fourth mandate in Madhya Pradesh is now most firmly in the past. The lady was always fiery; her victory had given that extra edge to her self-confidence which prompted her to lay bare to the public her fury against the hostility to her from sections of the Bharatiya Janata Party. Her defiant assertion that she is the real BJP, her accusations against leaders such as Mr Arun Jaitley and Mr Pramod Mahajan, her declaration that she would not bow to disciplinary action, made the suspension from primary membership of the party inevitable. Ms Bharti had been restive from the time Mr Babulal Gaur had replaced her as chief minister of Madhya Pradesh. She wanted back that chair in the state she felt she had won for the BJP; a national-level general secretaryship was not enough. But her activities, whether as chief minister or subsequently, had alienated rather than gained friends. In her last battle against the elevation of Mr Shivraj Singh Chauhan to the chief minister?s post in the legislature party meeting, she had with her only 17 supporters against Mr Chauhan?s 154. Even the start of her vaunted Ram, Roti Yatra drew an unexpectedly thin crowd.

 While Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee?s statement that the party will not brook indiscipline evokes a dynamic, healthy BJP, the larger picture looks rather less healthy. The BJP had a massive victory in Madhya Pradesh, which was followed up with three chief ministers in two years. This bespeaks uncertainty and factionalism rather than confident experimentation. The fact that the BJP is in undisputed majority in the state legislature makes these changes even more ominous, especially at a time the party president is on his way out. Madhya Pradesh is really not an exception. From the point of view of multiple power centres, Uttar Pradesh was always troublesome. Now Gujarat, and even Bihar are showing up divisions. Indiscipline is nesting at the core. The BJP has long been forced to give up its USP of being different, it might have to give up the shreds of its image of good governance too. Factionalism has been the bane of the Congress, the BJP seems to be growing more like it every day. Ms Bharti?s threat to form a new party may be unimportant. What is not are the signs of power tussles within.

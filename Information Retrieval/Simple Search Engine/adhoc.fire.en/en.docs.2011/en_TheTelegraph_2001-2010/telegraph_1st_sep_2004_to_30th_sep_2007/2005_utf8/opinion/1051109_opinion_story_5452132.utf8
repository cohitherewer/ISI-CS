 TO CHART A NEW COURSE OF ACTION

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the Human Development Report 2005

 What are the implications of the current global human development trajectory for the millennium development goals? 

 We address this question by using country data to project where the world will be in relation to some of the main MDGs by 2015. The picture is not encouraging. If current trends continue, there will be large gaps between MDG targets and outcomes. Those gaps can be expressed in statistics, but ...human costs can never be captured by numbers alone. Among the consequences for developing countries of continuing on the current path:

 The MDG goal for reducing child mortality will be missed by 4.4 million avoidable child deaths ? a figure equivalent to three times the number of children under age 5 in London, New York and Tokyo. Over the next 10 years the gap between the target and the current trend adds more than 41 million children who will die before their fifth birthday from the most readily curable of all diseases ? poverty. 

 The gap between the MDG target for halving poverty and projected outcomes is equivalent to an additional 380 million people living on less than $1 a day by 2015. 

 The MDG target of universal primary education will be missed on current trends, with 47 million children still out of school in 2015. These are simple forward projections of current trends ? and trends are not destiny. As the financial market dictum puts it, past performance is not a guide to future outcomes. For the MDGs that is unambiguously good news. Some of the world?s poorest countries?including Bangladesh, Uganda and Vietnam? have shown that rapid progress is possible. But rich countries need to help meet the start-up costs of a global human development take-off.

 As governments prepare for the 2005 UN summit, the 2015 projection offers a clear warning. To put it bluntly, the world is heading for a heavily sign-posted human development disaster, the cost of which will be counted in avoidable deaths, children out of school and lost opportunities for poverty reduction. That disaster is as avoidable as it is predictable. If governments are serious about their commitment to the MDGs, business as usual is not an option. The 2005 UN summit provides an opportunity to chart a new course for the next decade.

 Human development gaps within countries are as stark as the gaps between countries. These gaps reflect unequal opportunity ? people held back because of their gender, group identity, wealth or location. Such inequalities are unjust. They are also economically wasteful and socially destabilizing. Overcoming the structural forces that create and perpetuate extreme inequality is one of the most efficient routes for overcoming extreme poverty, enhancing the welfare of society and accelerating progress towards the MDGs.

 The MDGs themselves are a vital statement of international purpose rooted in a commitment to basic human rights. These rights ? are universal in nature. That is why progress towards the MDGs should be for all people, regardless of their household income, their gender or their location. However, governments measure progress by reference to national averages. These averages can obscure deep inequalities in progress rooted in disparities based on wealth, gender, group identity and other factors.

 Failure to tackle extreme inequalities is acting as a brake on progress towards achieving the MDGs. On many of the MDGs the poor and disadvantaged are falling behind. Cross-country analysis suggests that child mortality rates among the poorest 20 per cent of the population are falling at less than one-half of the world average. Creating the conditions under which the poor can catch up as part of an overall human development advance would give a dynamic new impetus to the MDGs. It would also address a cause of social injustice.

 Multiple and interlocking layers of inequality create disadvantages for people throughout their lives. Income inequality is increasing in countries that account for more than 80 per cent of the world?s population. Inequality in this dimension matters partly because of the link between distribution patterns and poverty levels. High levels of income inequality are bad for growth, and they weaken the rate at which growth is converted into poverty reduction: they reduce the size of the economic pie and the size of the slice captured by the poor.

 Tragic end

 Sir ? The gruesome murder of Mariappan Raman Kutty by the taliban in Afghanistan needs condemnation world-wide. The man, an innocent employee of the Border Roads Organisation, was there as part of the initiative of the Indian government to help the war-torn nation revive with its $550 million aid (?Taliban abduct Indian driver?, Nov 21). The laying of the Zaranj-Delaram road was to give Afghanistan a better infrastructure. But look at the way the Afghans have repaid its debt to India. India should take up the case at the highest level in the United Nations and bring pressure on the Afghanistan government to nab the culprits. Further, like the Geneva agreement which was signed by all countries for the safety of prisoners of war, there should be an international accord for the safety of foreign workers deputed in other countries.

 Yours faithfully,

R. Sekar, Angul, Orissa

 Sir ? Of what use will be the prime minister?s words to the bereaved family of M.R. Kutty (?Blood on road to bypass Pak?, Nov 24)? Manmohan Singh has reportedly described Kutty as a brave Indian, who was working for the cause of peace in Afghanistan. If that be the case, why was the Indian government pussy-footing over his release? Had Kutty been a diplomat in the Indian embassy in Kabul, would he have been left to die by his countrymen? Kutty was killed because he was an ordinary Indian citizen engaged in an ordinary profession. Kutty?s modest credentials, obviously, were not enough to move the Indian ministry of external affairs even 48 hours after his abduction. Kutty was not a victim of the taliban, but one of India?s discriminatory culture where VIPs are always more equal than lesser mortals like him.

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, 

 Jamshedpur

 Sir ? The killing of M.R. Kutty by the taliban is a dastardly act. The immediate action of the government should be to ensure the safety of the hundreds of Indians still working there. But who is actually responsible for Kutty?s death? Religious fanatics in Afghanistan? George W. Bush? Or the Indian government? Who is going to stop these killings which have been going on in Iraq and Afghanistan? The civilized world should do it, and with force if necessary.

 Yours faithfully,

Suman Barthakur, Guwahati

 Sir ? The lackadaisical approach of the MEA and the prime minister?s office in dealing with the Kutty episode is deplorable. The arguments that the deadline of 48 hours, given by the Afghan terrorist outfit, was not enough for negotiation, and that the militants did not keep in touch with the Indian embassy in Afghanistan or the MEA are not convincing. Indian officials at the helm should have swiftly initiated action instead of waiting for the taliban to come forward. The kidnapped driver would not have lost his life had the authorities taken the decision to stop the road construction immediately. 

 The people of this country have not forgotten several of the past instances where the government has surrendered to terrorist demands in order to save the lives of politicians. Should the government not suspend its aid and operations in Afghanistan till the Hamid Karzai government guarantees security to Indian nationals working there?

 Yours faithfully, 

P.J. Koshy, Calcutta

 Sir ? How many of us are ready to go to a killing field just to earn few extra bucks? M.R. Kutty was well aware of the dangers involved in his work and therefore should be honoured as a true civilian soldier. The thing that jars in the entire episode is the attitude of the Indian government. If each country undertaking development work in Afghanistan, the United States of America mainly, has managed to provide tight security to its workers, why did India fail to do so? 

 Kutty, in the end, was a victim of the strategic war between Pakistan and India, both of which have their own axe to grind in helping Afghanistan develop. While India wants to seek a toehold by improving friendly relations with Afghanistan, Pakistan wants to do the same, but by force. And the taliban who killed Kutty were forwarding Pakistan?s agenda in the region, not their own. For even at the height of the taliban regime, it was the Pakistan Inter-Services Intelligence which was ruling the roost. Yet little does Pakistan realize that it is endangering its own backyard. Afghanistan has turned into a safe haven for al Qaida and taliban terrorists who pose a threat not merely to Afghanistan, but to the whole world, including Pakistan. It is also time Americans stopped pampering Pakistan. If al Qaida continues its activities and the taliban are back in action, it is thanks to Pakistan. Unless Pakistan is tamed, the US would be wasting its time hunting terrorists and rebuilding Afghanistan. 

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

 Sir ? M.R. Kutty lost his life at the prime of his life while ?working in the cause of peace?. As a recompense, the government gave him the encomium of a ?brave Indian? and Rs 10 lakh to his family. But why did Kutty have to die in the first place? The government already knew that Afghanistan was not exactly safe. So security arrangements should have been made. Unfortunately, this was not done, nor proper steps taken after the abduction. The Indian government has failed in its prime duty to secure the lives of its citizens.

 Yours faithfully,

P.K. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? The entire world keeps talking of fighting terrorism. But when it comes to taking action, why do even the most powerful nations in the world look like helpless dwarves? It was heart-rending to see the family photograph of M.R. Kutty, and, next to it, the sight of his wife crying. For each one that die in the hands of terrorists, there are several others who die too. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shreya Mishra, Bhopal

 Sir ? The Indian government hastily sent the BRO contingent without a detailed threat perception exercise just because it wanted to get into the good books of Kabul and the US. New Delhi must immediately withdraw all aid workers from Afghanistan. Incidentally, it was amusing to read that the government has said that the ?Taliban and its backers should be prepared to face the consequences of this dastardly act.? What precisely can India do? When we lack the moral courage to do anything against terrorists based in Pakistan-occupied- Kashmir, how can we do anything heroic against the taliban? Clearly, our prime minister has been taken for a ride by Bush, Pervez Musharraf and Karzai. 

 Yours faithfully,

J. Dutta, Calcutta

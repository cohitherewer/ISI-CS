 CORRUPT TO THE BONE

 At the level of the common man?s black humour, The India Corruption Study 2005 must be fun to read. There are very few surprises; but to read, yet again, that Bihar is the most corrupt state in India, ranking 20th, still has an effect that may be described as comic. Kerala, as the least corrupt, is predictably the first boy. And there is something funny too about this predictability. But all this funniness is actually the other side of something rather grim. Corruption ? the use of public office for private gain ? is so ancient and pervasive, so much part of everyday life, that it has numbed the ordinary citizen into finding it funny. Corruption has become a ?natural? part of Indian life ? like crows and cows and cricket. And this is sad and shameful, and worth being reminded of as such from time to time. Transparency International (India) ought to be thanked, therefore, for the survey, which should have made a bigger noise in the public domain. But that itself is part of the problem.

 There is another startling fact that reveals itself in the survey. The two most corrupt public services across all the states ? in terms of popular perception as well as the actual experience of paying bribes ? are the police and the schools (private ones included). Law and order, and education: in these two essential sectors, Indian society remains least transparent and accountable. (These are followed by the lower courts and land administration.) From beginning to end, every stage of an Indian child?s journey through school is marked by varying degrees of corruption. Admissions, private tuition, results, the next stage of public examinations, and even such trivial matters as getting transcripts out in time ? all involve bribing or unconscionable gains of some sort. And here too the corruption has become natural; hence, the most respectable of the middle and upper classes do it without feeling terribly put out. With the police, the matter is more obviously grim, because the abuse of power ? and the powerlessness of the poor, of those without clout, in the face of this abuse ? takes on more brutal forms. Yet even this dangerous face of corruption in the police has come to be perceived, with time, as part of the normal course of things in India.

 West Bengal has its place of honour in this survey. Ranking 8th on the list, five places below Gujarat, the most corrupt of Bengal?s public services are its water services. The Calcutta high court had recently wanted to know what Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s government has done so far about providing clean drinking water to the people of the state. So the government?s pleader told the stunned high court judges, with no sense whatsoever of the outrageousness of his words, that the Calcutta Municipal Corporation?s drinking-water supply schemes would take another twenty years to be carried out. This is Indian corruption in its classic form ? shameful, yet shamelessly entertaining too.

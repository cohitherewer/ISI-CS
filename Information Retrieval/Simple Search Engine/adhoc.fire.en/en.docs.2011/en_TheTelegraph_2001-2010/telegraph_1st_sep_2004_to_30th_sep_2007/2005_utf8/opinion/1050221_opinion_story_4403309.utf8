 CALCUTTA KILLS

 Calcutta kills little children, slowly as well as quickly. The pollution in the air and the arsenic in the water take a while. Even when the effect is not always fatal, the bodily damage is serious. Then there are the government hospitals for children. They take less time, and do it in phases and batches. The quickest are the roads, where death-traps are maintained by the police, the transport department, the municipality and, to some extent, the public. In the last few days, a number of children have been killed on the roads. It is worth looking at the combination of factors that has caused these accidents. 

 First, the drivers. Private and state buses have now created their jungle laws on the roads. The notorious ?commission system?, by which drivers and conductors earn their money, seems to foster nothing but brute competitiveness. The highest authorities in the state have pronounced that nothing can be done about this. Hence, the worst killers are allowed to get away. Second, the traffic police. They are either not present where they are supposed to be, or they allow vehicles on to prohibited roads for a bribe, or their presence is just too insignificant to counter the fatal effects of all the other factors operating together. They are also entirely unable to enforce certain basic safety regulations, like the use of helmets, seatbelts, zebra crossings and traffic lights (when they are working properly). Third, the state of the roads is often so bad that it could become difficult for vehicles to maintain control, and this is dangerous. Besides, traffic and pedestrian lights are frequently uncoordinated and misleading (in all the major crossings on Park Street, for instance), and this too can be fatal. Finally, adult citizens must also take some of the responsibility for many of these mishaps. Nobody seems to have realized why seatbelts have become mandatory. Large families are seen on two-wheelers, with the parents wearing formidable helmets, and the children placed between the parents and in front of the driver with nothing protecting their heads. Each of these factors, or a combination of them, could kill instantly. And what is most shocking, the city has got used to this sort of thing.

 OF TIGERS AND TREES 

 Malvika Singh

 Things, they are a-changing! Most NGOs are becoming QGO?s, quasi-government organizations, triumphantly co-opted by ruling authorities. They are furiously busy claiming to ?right the wrongs? of the past. The tribal rights bill is one such attempt. Pushing for fresh legislation without adequate thought creates many problems that become festering sores. Fortunately, the tribal rights bill came in for some marginal discussion but alas, it seems to have angered many who proposed it. Despite the debate, it needs more serious thought before it is ?quietly? tabled. This may not happen. The bill will go through because bureaucrats and QGOs know well that all political parties will vote in favour of the bill ? tribals are an eight per cent vote bank.

 The bill will please the land and timber ?professionals?, mafias, because they know better than many of us that in India it is easy to buy out the poor and grab the land. That village heads will protect the trees is laughable. We all know that rampant corruption and bribery dominate the landscape of both rural and urban India. Who is going to administer the ?righting of the wrongs?? A corrupt and inept administration? It has not managed to pay the Bhopal gas tragedy victims in one single city after years and years. How on earth will it deliver to the ?tribals?? It will exploit the unsuspecting tribals to the point of no return and make hay till tigers and trees are extinct.

 The other face of the coin is the Waqf Board that claims the Taj Mahal as its property. Soon the ASI will be extinct too, as the Waqf begin to claim pre- Mughal and Mughal India. Maybe the National Trust in Britain should work a strategy and claim some of its heritage sites as surviving examples of its colonial history. Why not? And, while we are at it, the erstwhile royals of India should file PILs in court and claim their properties, the forts and palaces that lie scattered across our benighted land. Let?s have a free-for-all and include the diverse strata of India, with all the different, varied rules, norms and values that the privileged in power or close to power, the QGOs of today, choose to apply, based on their whims and fancies, at a particular point in time. Life here is becoming a bit of a joke, a maudlin and bizarre ?joke?.

 The other breed having a field day ? FFAs, foreign funding agencies, that, attempting to appear politically correct, refer to themselves as ?foundations?, and sit in slick offices in metropolitan cities, desperately ?networking? or hobnobbing with the ?power? elite. They are fast becoming cariacatures, as they busy themselves imagining they are setting new agendas, ?doing good? for the less privileged. These organizations and the government are like twins, separated at birth.

 And, in the political space, the CPI(M) is having a ball?it is supposed to have had a change in guard but the rhetoric is as it was when Stalin was alive and kicking. Surjeet seems to represent a more youthful generation than Karat does. The latter was off to the motherland, which is why discussions with the UPA on the divestment of Bhel were delayed. What copouts they are ? outside of government, forever negative, always contrary, with zero responsibility, no accountability, but with predictable and pompous slogan-mongering, keeping in strict purdah all the contradictions within their party, undemocratic and unchanging. Small wonder that they are relegated to one corner of India.

 Karat, reportedly, is in China to discuss Sino-Indian affairs. I thought that is what the government is supposed to do?where is Natwar Singh? Has he abdicated? Has the foreign affairs ministry also been outsourced to Prakash Karat? It is fascinating to watch this party with no national numbers or power, with no accountability whatsoever, actively manipulating Delhi.

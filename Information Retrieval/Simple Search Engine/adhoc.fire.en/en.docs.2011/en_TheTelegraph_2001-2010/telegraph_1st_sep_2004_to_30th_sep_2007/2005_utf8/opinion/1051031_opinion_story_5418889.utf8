 FRESH START

 A small step, but good enough to break the ice. That perhaps is the best way to view the outcome of the talks between the home secretaries of India and Bangladesh. The agreement to provide consular access to each other?s arrested nationals on a reciprocal basis may ease much of the current tensions between the two countries. It will go some way in addressing New Delhi?s concern about the militants from India?s North-east using Bangladeshi territory for training their cadre. Persistent refusals by the present regime in Dhaka to address this Indian concern have strained relations between the two countries. This led New Delhi to suspect that Dhaka sought to use the north-eastern militancy as a tool of diplomacy. Dhaka, on the other hand, saw an Indian ?conspiracy? behind every major incident of violence in Bangladesh. So much so that the Indian hand was suspected to have been there behind the serial bomb blasts in Bangladesh last August or behind the grenade attack on an Awami League rally last year. The growing impatience in New Delhi with Dhaka?s posturings was evident in the collpase of the recent talks between the Border Security Force and the Bangladesh Rifles. The latest agreement could thus signal a new beginning.

 However, the two sides still have a long way to go. Even at the meeting between the two home secretaries, Dhaka refused to allow India an access to areas within Bangladesh where the north-eastern insurgents are suspected to have their camps. Not only did the two sides fail to clinch the issue, they also differed on including it in the joint statement issued after the meeting. It is not difficult to see why Dhaka is still so sensitive to the issue. Allowing India to investigate the activities by the militants on its territory could pose two problems for Dhaka. First, it would be seen as an acceptance of the Indian charge that these camps existed within Bangladesh. As such, it would nail Dhaka?s lie on this count. Second, it would have its impact on Bangladesh?s domestic politics. The ruling combine led by the prime minister, Ms Khaleda Zia, thrives on its anti-India propaganda. It could thus be politically inexpedient for her government to agree to something that would be seen by vested interests in Bangladesh as a threat to the country?s sovereignty. It is time, though, Dhaka learnt to free its foreign policy from its domestic politics.

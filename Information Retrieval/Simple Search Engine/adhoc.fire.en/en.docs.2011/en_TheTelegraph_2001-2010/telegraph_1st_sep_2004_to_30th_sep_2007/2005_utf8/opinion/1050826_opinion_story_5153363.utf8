 Paperback Pickings

 Stomachs are a lost cause

 On Shopping (Penguin, 70p) by India Knight is another one of those 70p/ 70th birthday offerings from Penguin, and is a delightfully personal account of ?retail therapy? by a woman who believes that ?hating shopping is a terrible accident?. Knight?s persona here is a mix of Cosmo bitch, agony aunt, wry memoirist and culture-critic, and provides hilarious nuggets of advice, under headings like ?What to Wear If You?re Not a Size 12?: ?Stomachs. Grim, innit? Mine is horrendous from two C-sections and no sit-ups. I don?t think there?s any disguising miracle, stomach wise ? alas. The Old Pants of Steel do help, though. I just show my breasts quite a lot and hope that no one?s eye travels downwards too much. Try also praying to St Jude, the patron saint of lost causes.?

 Speaking of Films (Penguin, Rs 275) by Satyajit Ray is an important collection of essays on every aspect of cinema and film-making, translated by Gopa Majumdar, originally published in Bengali as Bishay Chalachchitra in the early Eighties. Ray?s 1982 Amal Bhattacharji Memorial Lecture, ?My Life, My Work?, is also reprinted here. These are invaluable essays, beginning with two long ones on structure, language and style in film, followed by shorter but acute pieces on dialogue, music and colour, essays on Soviet and early Bengali cinema, on actors (Chhabi Biswas, Chunibala Debi), individual films (Apur Sansar, Charulata), and a beautiful tribute to the artist, Binode Bihari Mukhopadhyay. Ray?s dry, unpretentious brilliance, and the brisk pace of his Bengali are well captured in this translation.

 Sadak Chhaap (Penguin, Rs 250) by Meher Pestonji is a remarkable novel about the lives of street children in Mumbai. It is written without sentimentality or any wish to transform these lives into respectable clich?s. Pestonji is not only a novelist, but has also campaigned for a change in rape laws, housing rights for slum-dwellers, and a more sensitive understanding of street children and their special needs. A lot of this experience and thinking enters this novel without making it didactic, evolving a spare and realistic narrative that is unsparing, yet humanely engaging. 

 The Home and the World (Penguin, Rs 200) by Rabindranath Tagore is Sreejata Guha?s translation of Tagore?s 1916 novel, a modern work of rare complexity and beauty. This is an unfortunate translation that seeks to improve the 1919 version done by Surendranath Tagore. Ghare Baire is one of Rabindranath?s most difficult works, interlacing three distinct voices to create an intricate blend of inwardness and historicity that demands a finely tuned ear for both Bengali and English prose from its translator, a musical sense of style. There are basic problems with grammar in Guha?s English ? minute errors in the use of prepositions and number, inaccurate English colloquialisms, and so on ? which add up to a rather unsatisfactory effect, transforming the depths and mysteries of Tagore?s tragic writing into an erratically textured mawkishness. Here is the crucial reconciliation scene between Nikhilesh and Bimala, as narrated by Nikhilesh: ?I stroked her head gently for a while. And then, at some point she groped around and took my feet in her hands. She pressed it so hard to her heart that I felt it would break from the burden of my feet.? The last sentence is an ungrammatical mess. The first ?it? is wrongly used for the plural ?feet?, and is impossible to distinguish from the second ?it? which refers to Bimala?s heart. The least that one expects from an ambitious translator ? she chose nothing less than Ghare Baire ? is correct English. An ear for prose can come later.

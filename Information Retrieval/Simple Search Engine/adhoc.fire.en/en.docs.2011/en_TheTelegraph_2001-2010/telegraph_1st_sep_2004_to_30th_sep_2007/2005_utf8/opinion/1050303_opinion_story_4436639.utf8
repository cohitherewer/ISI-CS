 Letters to Editor

 Brand cow

 Sir ? ?If you can?t convert the philistines, you might as well preach to the converted? seems to be the motto of the Bharatiya Janata Party (?Cow urine hotter than mascot in BJP market?, March 2). The party had tried hard when in power to put the cow at the centre of its politics. But the voters were just not interested. Since the cow failed as a political mascot, why not make it a commercial one? Thus peddling toothpaste, detergents, whitening creams, aftershaves and even cures for baldness and obesity at a BJP souvenir shop makes a kind of horse ? rather, cow ? sense. The popularity of these products shows that the saffronites have decided to put their money where their faith is. More conveniently for the BJP, highlighting the cow can help to hide the paucity of saleable leaders and avoid the personality clashes that might result if one leader is played up more than others.

 Yours faithfully,

Ratna Sen, Calcutta

 In perspective

 Sir ? In ?Style of the historian? (Feb 27), Rudrangshu Mukherjee laments Indian historians? contempt for style. History as an academic discourse is much more than a simple narration of events. It is the contextual analysis of a period, which requires a good deal of theorization. A history book also cannot be devoid of its author?s ideological orientations, which help the reader develop his own perspective. I agree with Mukherjee?s views on Partha Chatterjee, probably one of the finest social scientists in India today. Chatterjee?s mode of analysis has varied according to the requirements of his object of study. His works on nationalism and the socioeconomic developments in postcolonial India have a fine balance of narrative style and theorizing. But one can clearly delineate Chatterjee?s ideological orientation from his prose and his use of the language of theory, primarily terms from the Marxist lexicon. 

 I agree that good history should be factually told and easily understandable. But associating good history-writing with minimal theorization would be a gross oversimplification and would also take away from the charm of a good history book.

 Yours faithfully,

Antara Acharya Dutta, Calcutta

 Sir ? The impenetrable and soporific prose of history books must have something to do with the general perception of history as being ?boring?. While the historians may be proud of making no concessions to the ignorant lay reader, this perception is probably why few students want to take up history for higher study. 

 Yours faithfully,

J. Nath, Calcutta

 Sir ? Ramachandra Guha very astutely attributes the popularity of television programmes on history, especially the history of war, in the UK and US, to the fact that ?the wars were won by the countries in which these programmes were made and more importantly, viewed? (?History in the box?, Feb 19). 

 But history is less contentious in these countries than in India. Here, it would be difficult to accommodate, in one narrative, the views and contributions of Gandhi, Ambedkar, Bhagat Singh, Nehru, Bose, Jinnah and Savarkar. Some of these viewpoints may even be construed as being against the nation?s interests now. 

 Yours faithfully,

Abhijit Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? TV producers lack the courage or the patience to probe deeply. The rigour, to probe or to make use of research, so necessary to make engrossing historical programmes, has never been the forte of Indian TV producers who look at history. It is evident that they have come to the subject merely to make a few extra bucks. But even if they are sincere, technical shortcomings let them down. It is thus foolish to hope for worthwhile history programmes in India. 

 Not long ago, Bhagat Singh had been the flavour of the season for film producers. But the films that resulted were all caricatures of reality. They had everything except facts, which are the only things that matter. 

 Two earlier serials, Bharat Ek Khoj and Tamas, may be cited as exceptions to this but they failed to create much of an impact. Compare these films with Richard Attenborough?s sensitive portrayal of Mahatma Gandhi?s life. I think we will have to wait for many more years for Indian programmes which use history in a meaningful way.

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad

 Unfairly out

Sir ?Despite his consistently good performance in 

Australia and Bangladesh, the middle-order Indian batsman, Mohammed Kaif, has 

not been given a place in the Indian team that will play test matches against 

the visiting Pakistanis. This is mystifying to every Indian cricket fan. 

In this regard, Sourav Ganguly?s statement that he wanted Yuvraj Singh in the team at any cost, and the south-zone representative?s strong pitch for V.V.S. Laxman are unfortunate. This shows that the selectors are perhaps not serious about choosing the best team. Kaif?s memorable innings, in which he darted madly for the seemingly impossible run no. 326 at Lord?s and took India to a scintillating victory, will be remembered by cricket-lovers across the globe. But Yuvraj Singh, whose has showed indifferent form in tests in the recent past, has been given a chance. Is this not an illustration of discrimination against the players who are performing well? And will it not discourage young cricketers who want to take up the game as a profession?

 Yours faithfully,

Md. Sabir Ansari, Aligarh

Sir ?Leaving Mohammed Kaif out of the Indian team 

is shocking. Of what use are the pre-selection matches if someone?s performance 

in them is not taken into account? It is time that the likes of Sachin Tendulkar 

are made to fight for their place in the team rather than have it reserved for 

them on the basis of past performance. 

Yours faithfully,

Udita Agrawal, New Delhi

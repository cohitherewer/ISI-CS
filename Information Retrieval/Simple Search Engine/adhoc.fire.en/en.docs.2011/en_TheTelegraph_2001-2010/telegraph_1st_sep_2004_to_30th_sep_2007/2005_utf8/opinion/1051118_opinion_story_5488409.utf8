 BLESSED BE THE READER

 The inside story

 Revelations: Personal responses to the Books of the Bible, Introduced

 by Richard Holloway, 

 Canon Gate, ? 7.20 

 This book presents a novel and a very interesting approach to the Bible. Various people, drawn from different walks of life, were asked to choose their favourite books of the Bible and to comment upon them. The assumption behind the project is that there cannot be one single given interpretation of the contents of the world?s most popular book. Thus, the Dalai Lama, Bono, the rock star, A.S. Byatt, the novelist, and Karen Armstrong, the renowned writer on religious matters, all rub shoulders together with others between the covers of this book.

 There is another assumption behind this book. It sees the Bible, as, above all, a work of literature. Therefore, it can attract people across faiths and even non-believers. No one who has read the Bible in the Authorized Version, will have any quarrels with this assumption. The King James version, the other name for the Authorized Version, has a unique and haunting beauty which has not been surpassed in any other version of the Bible. One has only to compare the rendering of the 23rd Psalm in the King James version with modern renderings to recognize the difference between poetry and dull prose. Not surprisingly, the contributors to this volume were asked to respond to the King James version. This book is a celebration of that Bible as much as it is a celebration of language and individual interpretation.

 The publication of this book was not without controversy. A man called Paul Slenett, who has appointed himself leader of the ?Jesus is Alive Ministry? staged a protest against the book because he believed the real Bible was being hijacked.

 Slenett?s protest can be dismissed as emanating from the loony fringe of Christianity but yet his anger points to a genuine tension in approaches that people take to the Bible. This tension can be best comprehended, as Richard Holloway notes in his introduction to the volume, in terms of the distinction between logos (knowledge or facts) and mythos (myths). There are Christians who read the Bible as logos, as a repository of facts or as a record of actual events. The Bible, like all the holy books of religion, belongs to the genre of myths. This statement will annoy religious fundamentalists as they see religious texts as revealed truths rather than as myth and poetry.

 In this book, the Bible is made to speak to the individual?s heart and imagination. A.S. Byatt, for example, responds to the erotically charged verses of Song of Songs by associating them in her mind to the poetry of Paul Celan which evoked the Holocaust. In Byatt?s interpretation, Song of Songs represents a text that lives beyond its own context and times and looks forward into the terrible history of the Jewish people. But this is an individual reading in excelsis. So are all the other essays, on the various parts of the Bible, in this book.

 Perhaps the most profound passage in the New Testament is the opening verse of the Gospel of St John: ?In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.? This book celebrates the Word but places it firmly with the reader. As Matthew says (24:15): ?Whoso readeth, let him understand.? The Bible becomes the book of intellectual and spiritual liberation.

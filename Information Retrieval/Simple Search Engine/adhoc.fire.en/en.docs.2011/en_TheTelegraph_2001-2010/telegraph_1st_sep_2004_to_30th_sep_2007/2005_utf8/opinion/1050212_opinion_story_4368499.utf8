 Out and About

 Unserious? Authors who use such words are a publisher?s nightmare, but Rupa is ready to forgive Chetan Bhagat (Five Point Someone). In fact, it is ready to go much further and celebrate the author (picture left), and another of his kind, Anurag Mathur (The Inscrutable Americans) as representatives of cooldom, saying that they sell well, look good and yet, write easy and don?t make too much of themselves. In a word, ?unserious?. Rupa will recognise their achievements in Delhi next Thursday, and ?intelligent and good-looking people? are invited to join in for some serious cocktailing. Yo!

 Members of Viva

 And then the band disbanded. And the better half got to work in a film. Two of girl band Viva?s now out-of-work members have found an angel in music composer Sandeep Chowta, who has cast them in a 10-minute film he?s directed. Dead End is on drug abuse in India, and is all set to hit the short film circuit this year. Viva, synonymous with bubble-gum pop a couple of years ago, had since faded into oblivion after their contract with Channel [V] , who?d selected them after a talent hunt, expired. Chowta was a judge at the hunt, and no surprises, he loved them then. So now, Anushka Manchanda and Mahuya Kamat find themselves doing something relevant. For a change.

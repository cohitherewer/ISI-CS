 BY DEFINITION

 The definition of a people could be at the heart of their politics. Assam?s politicians have not found it easy to define who the Assamese are. But the present chief minister, Mr Tarun Gogoi, has little choice but to do it. He is, therefore, exchanging notes with the Asam Sahitya Sabha towards a definition of the Assamese. Finding an acceptable definition is crucial to both the Centre and the state government. For, the absence of the definition is apparently holding up the implementation of an important pledge made in the Assam accord of 1985. Unless the Assamese people are ?defined?, New Delhi and Dispur cannot decide who the ?indigenous? people living in Assam are. And, without this knowledge, the governments are unsure of providing the political safeguards that were promised to the indigenous people in the accord. As he ?finalizes? the definition, Mr Gogoi needs to be extremely cautious. Assam?s ethnic diversity has made it vulnerable time and again to mistrust and even hostility between different communities. Mr Gogoi could find it helpful to involve a large cross-section of public opinion before his government settles on a particular demographic identity for the Assamese people. 

 Mr Gogoi?s other problem ? the identification and deportation of illegal migrants in Assam ? is just as tricky. No wonder that the tripartite meeting between the Centre, the state government and the All Assam Students? Union failed yet again to reach a consensus on the issue. The violent agitation in Assam in the early Eighties had its genesis in the people?s fear of being swamped by illegal migrants from Bangladesh. Successive ruling parties have been more interested in using the issue for their electoral arithmetic than in resolving it. That was why the courts set up under the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunal) Act achieved virtually nothing. It is time that the governments looked at it as an administrative, rather than a political, issue. It is important, though, not to abuse the act in order to harass and persecute legal settlers in Assam. But keeping the issue unresolved is a sure recipe for future trouble. It is important to implement projects and other provisions of the accord. The most important thing, however, is to free the people of Assam from their sense of insecurity in the face of unchecked migration from across the border. The governments in both New Delhi and Dispur owe it to Assam.

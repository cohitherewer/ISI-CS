 STEP DOWN

 If Caesar?s wife, in Roman times, was asked to be above suspicion, then it follows that a cabinet minister in a democracy should be completely free of taint. Unfortunately, in India, such high standards of public morality are hardly ever adhered to. There are exceptions. In the recent past, Mr L.K. Advani offered to resign as member of the Lok Sabha till his name was cleared in the notorious hawala case. In Britain, a minister quits whenever the lurid light of suspicion falls on him. Mr K. Natwar Singh, the minister for external affairs, would be well advised to follow the example of such public figures. By stepping down, he will earn for himself an enormous amount of goodwill and will also save the prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, unnecessary embarrassment and trouble. This is not to suggest that the foreign minister is guilty as charged in the Volcker report. The question of guilt or innocence can only be settled after more details are available and more investigations about the charges have been made. Pending all this, it cannot be denied that a slur has been put on Mr Natwar Singh?s reputation. That taint gives to his enemies, and the enemies of the United Progressive Alliance, an opportunity to score a few political points. What is worse, it puts Mr Singh at a terrible disadvantage at the diplomatic high table. These are sufficient grounds for him to step down with dignity, and to return with even greater dignity once his name has been cleared.

 Despite his wisdom and experience, Mr Singh has chosen not to follow this path. On the contrary, he has opted to attack the report and to locate a conspiracy against him. The desire to construct a conspiracy theory can perhaps be pardoned since it grows out of Mr Singh?s delusions of grandeur. His position on Iraq was inconsequential to the author of the report and to the United States of America, the alleged mastermind of the conspiracy. Mr Singh?s protestations are, in fact, self-defeating. They convince no one and only strengthen suspicions. Instead of attacking the credibility of the Volcker report, Mr Singh should concentrate on fortifying his own credibility as a public figure and statesman. He can do this by not continuing to hold public office as long as he remains under suspicion. Mr Singh cannot expect to command respect as long as he continues to show disrespect to one of the unwritten codes of public life.

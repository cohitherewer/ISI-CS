 NOT A ZERO SUM

 - Aumann and Schelling belong to different spectrums of game theorists

 This year?s Nobel prize in economics has been awarded to Robert Aumann of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Thomas Schelling of the University of Maryland for their contributions to game theory. This is the second time that the Nobel committee has awarded the prize in economics to a group of game theorists. The first year was in 1994 when John Nash (of A Beautiful Mind fame) was one of the winners.

 The award of two prizes within roughly a decade is a clear signal of the recognition that game theory is now an integral part of modern economics. The neoclassical paradigm of price-taking behaviour which implicitly assumed a large number of buyers and sellers, each relatively small given the overall size of the market, has been the dominant theme in economics from the days of Adam Smith. Of course, economists have always realized that this paradigm is only an approximation of how actual markets function. No serious economist ever challenged the fact that big firms had tremendous influence over the market.

 Despite the empirical prevalence of large sellers and buyers, the theoretical fascination with price-taking behaviour was perhaps partly due to the absence of proper methodological tools to analyse the behaviour of individual players with significant influence over market outcomes. Such firms have to be able to ?predict? or at least make informed conjectures about the behaviour of their rivals before they can choose their own optimal actions. For instance, a firm has to make an informed guess about how much its rival firm will produce in order to figure out how much it should itself plan to sell since the aggregate quantity on the market determines market prices. Similarly, a firm has to make a conjecture about its rival?s price strategy before deciding how much it can charge for its own products. Of course, the rival has to go through the same calculations before it arrives at its own optimal decisions.

 Game theory provides the tools for the analysis of such strategic choices. Its founders are John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern, who wrote their classic book, The Theory of Games and Economic Behaviour in 1944, although the basic issues involved in strategic interaction amongst a small number of ?players? can be traced back to the 19th-century French economist, A. Cournot. Indeed, the fundamental notion of equilibrium behaviour in such situations is typically called Cournot-Nash equilibrium. Much of von Neumann and Morgenstern?s work was concerned with the analysis of what they called zero-sum games. These are situations in which the interests of ?players? or agents are diametrically opposed ? what one agent wins is exactly what the other agent loses. This situation certainly characterizes all games such as chess or other games like soccer and cricket, and hence the name ?game? theory.

 Aumann and Schelling were some of the game theorists who emphasized the fact that most multi-person interactions provide scope for both conflict and cooperation, so that most games are not zero-sum after all. This awareness provided the impetus for the development of a powerful methodology. Today, the use of game theory is pervasive not only in economics but in many other diverse fields such as evolutionary biology, sociology and political science.

 Aumann and Schelling belong to very different spectrums of game theorists. Aumann is a theorist, and he has sought to develop general results which can be applied to a wide variety of contexts. In contrast, Schelling is very much more of an applied practitioner, emphasizing the relevance of game-theoretic reasoning in a large number of specific contexts.

 Aumann is a mathematician by training ? he is actually a professor of Mathematics in the Hebrew University. His work typically involves very sophisticated mathematical techniques, so much so that it is virtually impossible to describe the importance of his work in non-technical terms.

 There is universal agreement that his work has been truly foundational, addressing several basic issues in game theory. Several of his papers have influenced the direction of future research in the subject, and he is undoubtedly one of the principal architects of modern game theory. Not surprisingly, a large number of loyal followers were bitterly disappointed that the Nobel committee did not pay due recognition to his contributions in 1994. They will now feel that justice has at last been done.

 Among Aumann?s many contributions, perhaps his work on repeated or long-term interaction, has had the most profound influence both in the formal development of game theory as well as its applications in a wide variety of contexts. In a variety of contexts, agents interact repeatedly with one another. For instance, the same set of firms compete with one another in the market year after year. It is intuitive that such repeated interaction can sustain cooperation amongst competing agents because any deviation in cooperative behaviour by an agent in one period can be punished by the other agents in the future. In a seminal paper published as early as 1959, Aumann showed the extent to which such cooperative behaviour can be sustained even when agents have no explicit mechanism to enforce cooperative behaviour.

 A lot of Schelling?s work has also been in the general area of cooperative behaviour. He is most well-known for his book The Strategy of Conflict, published in 1960. This contained several fundamental insights on individual behaviour in bilateral bargaining situations. Bargaining involves some conflict of interest since each agent wants a larger share of the pie.

 At the same time, agreement is important since both parties lose in the absence of any agreement. Schelling pointed out that it may often make sense to adopt the seemingly counter-intuitive tactic of worsening one?s options in order to extract concessions from the opponent. A general may burn bridges behind his army in order to convince the enemy that he is not going to retreat. This may in turn convince the enemy to retreat.

 Such tactics work if the commitment is irreversible or can only be undone at great cost, because the commitment then becomes credible. The idea of credible commitment has developed into a key concept in public policy by Kydland and Prescott, who won last year?s Nobel prize in economics. Credible commitment or its absence also plays an important role in many other contexts. Schelling himself developed the idea that nuclear deterrence is never fully credible. Why should one country retaliate once it has been wiped out? In such situations, the best deterrence might be some element of randomness, for instance through a partly crazy leader!

 Schelling?s work on racial segregation provided an early example of the phenomenon of ?tipping? ? the rapid movement from one ?equilibrium? regime to another. The tipping phenomenon has been analysed by other social scientists in several different contexts. Basically, Schelling showed that communities can end up being segregated even if no single individual actively wants to live in a segregated community. In certain situations, all that is required is that an individual does not want to live as a minority in the neighbourhood, and so moves to another where he or she can be in the majority. This sort of consideration can result in population transfers which result in segregated communities.

 Schelling has also been a pioneer in behavioural economics, which is the current ?flavour of the month? amongst theoretical economists. He wrote several papers on addiction, memory and self-control almost 20 years ago. Economists have only recently turned their attention to the formal analyses of how these affect individual behaviour.

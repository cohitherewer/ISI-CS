 NARROW END

 Goodbye-time is also truth-telling time. Mr L.K. Advani, announcing his resignation from the position of Bharatiya Janata Party president in December at the party national executive, did not mince words when he decided to tell the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh exactly what he thought it was doing. Mr Advani is not overjoyed to have to leave at the RSS?s bidding after a tussle for ascendancy lasting six months. Things reached an ugly peak with the BJP president?s comments on M.A. Jinnah in Pakistan. The RSS became vociferous in its demand for his head. Yet that was an important moment, not least because it indicated that Mr Advani was making a serious effort to break the ideological shackles of his party and present it as acceptable to a wider swathe of people, of different communities and opinions. That was also the time that the former prime minister, Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee, spoke up publicly in support of Mr Advani, and blunted the RSS?s attack on him. But then came the tussle of power between the two senior leaders over Mr Madan Lal Khurana, with the disagreement between them over Mr Narendra Modi looming ominously in the background. Mr Advani?s following had begun to mew indecisively ever since the Jinnah episode, and there was not much to be done when a compromise was worked out with regard to Mr Khurana.

 The story is complicated, with threads of external pressure and internal conflict intricately woven together. But the outcome of the tale is truly unfortunate. In his speech, Mr Advani said that the RSS had denied the BJP the space and the autonomy to expand so it could include people outside its ideological domain in order to become a representative national party. The perception that no decision could be taken in the party without the RSS?s consent was damaging both to the BJP and the RSS. Mr Advani had begun to act on the inclusive ideal much later than Mr Vajpayee, whose moderate image had done much for the BJP?s acceptability in governance. Mr Advani?s shift of vision and direction could have strengthened the BJP. His departure ? because the RSS says so ? raises uncomfortable questions, for the party and for the country. What is the next batch of leaders going to do, follow the Hindutva line all over again? Would that mean polarization of the country or marginalization of the BJP? Either could affect basic equations within the Indian polity.

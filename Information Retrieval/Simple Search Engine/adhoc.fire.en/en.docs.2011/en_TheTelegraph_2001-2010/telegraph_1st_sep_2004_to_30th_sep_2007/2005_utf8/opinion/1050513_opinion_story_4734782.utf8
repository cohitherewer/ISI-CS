 STORIES ON THE WALLS

 It is not just films that tell stories. Cinema posters are chroniclers too, telling us tales of films in particular and of social change in general. THE VISION OF RAY: CINE POSTERS amp; BEYOND (Pratikshan, Rs 2,000), a collection of cine posters and other artworks of Satyajit Ray, collected and carefully preserved by Parimal Ray, offers a fascinating glimpse into another aspect of Ray?s versatile creativity ? film posters, booklets, lobbycards and banners, all of which were designed by the great man himself. Some of the posters, like the ones of Pather Panchali, Devi and Teen Kanya, bear testimony to Ray?s technical competence. Others, like the one from Parash Pathar, featuring a beaming Tulshi Chakraborty, captures the magic realism of a Ray film. One needs to thank Parimal Ray for ensuring that this rare collection has not met the sad fate of some other treasures.

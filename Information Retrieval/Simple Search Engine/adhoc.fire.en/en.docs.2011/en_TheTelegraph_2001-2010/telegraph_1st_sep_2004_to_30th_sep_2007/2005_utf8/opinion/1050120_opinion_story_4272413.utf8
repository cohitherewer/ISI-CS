 A TIME FOR NEWER THINGS

 Gouri Chatterjee

 Forgive the lowly literary devices, but it really was another sign of the times. Last week, the employees of the Times group in Mumbai bid good-bye to Pradeep Guha, the president of the organization, by forming a human chain that began in the office of the departing hero and snaked its way all the way down the massive building and out onto the street. Holding hands and looking stricken were subordinates from all sections, including senior editors. 

 Never before has a newspaper office witnessed such a warm, emotion-laced parting for a management boss. This was the sort of farewell that was once associated with the leave-taking of an editor. (Not necessarily because editors were more loveable but because power in a newspaper office resided with the editor.)

 Times of India has had no full-fledged ?Editor? since 1994. It didn?t matter. Just as it didn?t that Femina or Filmfare or Economic Times did have one each. Pradeep Guha was there. 

 Guha himself will tell you so. ?I have had many editorial successes,? he told me in 2001, down in Calcutta for one of his whirlwind trips. ?Bombay Times was my idea. Look how everyone is copying it now. I started Ascent. I revived Femina and Filmfare. This new ?Men amp; Women? [as their glossy Sunday section had then been renamed], I go through all the articles. They don?t release a single page without showing it to me, and we are now, what, into our seventh week,? reeled off the marketing whiz whose sole claim to journalism lay in covering the Filmfare awards (again, his baby) for the Times.

 He could have added the successful spearheading of the Page 3 culture and the dumbing down of newspapers with the launch of his Bombay Times. And the wholesale conversion of the media world to the view that news alone was not enough to sell papers and resources had to be shifted to events and other ?brand building? exercises. 

 Other attractions

 Guha could also claim credit for motivating his sales team by getting their annual meet (held in exotic locations like Spain and Scandinavia) covered in the paper by its brightest reporters, no matter what it did to the morale of journalists. Guha could also?the list of his achievements is long, and spectacular, indeed. 

 Maybe it was too much success for his bosses to stomach. Rumour has it, the 29 years of scintillating service notwithstanding, the owners of the Times group are happy to see Guha go. We are all human after all.

 But Guha was the best instrument Samir and Vineet Jain could have found to realize their own ambitions. When owners were more turned on by influence, they needed editors to achieve their goals. A Ramnath Goenka who wanted to take on an Indira Gandhi or a Dhirubhai Ambani needed an Arun Shourie, not a marketing whiz, to get the job done. 

 But for owners who believe, ?we are not in the newspaper business but in the business of attracting advertising,? as the brothers Jain have said often enough, editors with their penchant for rocking the boat and notions of public good can only be a liability. 

 Samir Jain learnt this the hard way. In the mid-Eighties, when he had just started learning the ropes in the family business, Jain brought in Arun Shourie as the executive editor of Times of India, then out of favour with Goenka. Shourie lasted just six months. Guha rose at supersonic speed.

 It is easy enough to let Guha go now. Thanks to Jain?s vision and Guha?s drive, the entire newspaper industry, not excepting journalists, believes unquestioningly that the business of newspapers is only to make money. Pradeep Guha may have left to join Zee TV, there are Guhas in every newspaper office today.

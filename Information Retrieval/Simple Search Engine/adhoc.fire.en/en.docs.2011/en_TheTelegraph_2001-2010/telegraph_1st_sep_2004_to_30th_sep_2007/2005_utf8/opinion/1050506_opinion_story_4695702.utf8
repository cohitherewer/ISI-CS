 WHEN COPY RIGHTS ARE WRONG

 Dead earnest

 Every major Indian educational publisher knows it: more than half the school and college textbooks are cut-and-paste jobs done by hack writers who see nothing wrong in plagiarizing from standard British and American books. But nothing was done for the simple reason that the dumbed-down versions sold very well. 

 The lack of reaction was also because our copyright law was too vague on intellectual property rights. Changes have been made in the law to plug the loopholes, but the situation seems to have worsened with new technologies like search engines. You can pick up what you want and get away with it.

 Major school texts in mathematics and the sciences were the first victims of plagiarism. The core texts for senior school students were lifted off. All that changed were the covers, the sequencing of questions and, of course, the proper nouns. So too with undergraduate texts in economics, mathematics and commerce. The disease spread wide and fast. Retired senior civil servants, even novelists-in-the-making wanting to get ?known?. 

 Publishers had a simple test for plagiarism: the unevenness of the essay. But there were some well-crafted essays that had the edges smoothened out. But these essayists got away not simply because the editors were not able to spot the ?cleverness? with which the cobbling had been done but because they were bigshots in the social and literary world. 

 Today, it isn?t just the easy accessibility of information that has made plagiarism so much simpler. In the digital world, the digital copy is as perfect as the original. Can anything be done to impede the spread of clones? 

 The dice is loaded heavily in favour of the pirates. Besides, pirates operate in small outfits that have an underground marketing and distribution network reaching out to the far corners of the country. Despite the constraints, however, and the unwillingness of publishers to invest time and money on tracking down the culprits, there are some remedies.

 First, change the kind of questions being asked in examinations. Plagiarism survives because questions asked need a purely factual recall. Make them a little applied so that they require understanding; this would compel students to think for themselves.

 Second, teachers who can easily spot the plagiarized texts must tell the publisher, who may be on guard the next time round. Sadly, academics tend to keep quiet. But their silence implicitly endorses the legality of plagiarism.

 Third, for plagiarism to succeed, the author needs to ask the right questions. Many of the plagiarists are unable to ask them, which results in a load of information that does not ?connect? with what is expected of students. It is in this ?disconnect? that our hope lies. What is to be kept in mind is that plagiarism is a more complex problem than a matter of right or wrong. So, don?t expect an ethical solution to the problem. All one can do is prevent it to the extent one can.

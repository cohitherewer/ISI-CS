 BILLED RIGHT

 There is much that is reassuring about the domestic violence bill. It enumerates ? astonishingly enough, for the first time ? the kinds of abuse that women face in their daily lives, especially in the home. It is no wonder that the reaction against it has been vicious, with men accusing the bill of striking at the institution of marriage. The protests often sound rather silly. Messages such as ?Say no to feminism and to the domestic violence bill,? posted on the web by organizations such as the Pariwarik Suraksha Sanstha and Forum of Battered Husbands, seem more like the ravings of bullies exposed than reasoned objections. There is no doubt that the bill has reached deep enough to hurt. The abuse or threat of abuse, it says, can be physical, sexual, verbal, emotional and economic. It applies to all women, not just wives in their marital homes, but to anyone living with the abuser because of ties of consanguinity or adoption. The first partial recognition of domestic abuse became official as late as 1983. But Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code was directed only towards the husband and his family and its end was imprisonment if the accused were found guilty of torture. The new bill exposes invisible abuse, and shifts the emphasis from punishment of the oppressor to the protection of the oppressed.

 The hysterical reaction of the bill?s opponents reveals the blind anger of guilt. Reason would have shown how difficult such a bill is to implement. Although women who hire killers to punish alleged abusers are rare, the harshness and occasional distortion in application of Section 498A are already causing worry. A law, unfortunately, can always be misused. Unfortunately again, it cannot change society. That is the real problem of the DVB. Its emphasis on rights and protection, its broad scope, its understanding and vision are truly reassuring. But all this is in an ideal sense. If it is meant to help those women who want violence to stop and the perpetrator chastened without being put in prison, how is the law to ensure this? It is one thing to make invisible violence visible, and quite another to proceed beyond that. The entry of the court into a relationship that the complainant wishes to continue may have unexpected ? and unwanted ? results. Before protesters start screaming about distortion, it is this fundamental anomaly that must be considered.

 THE RAILWAY CHILDREN 

 - What does it mean to be under eighteen and on the move? 

 AVEEK SEN

 I. WORK AND PLAY

 Rag-tag band 

 On the Black Diamond Express to 

 Asansol, three glimpses of the same child. He is about four 

 years old ? dirty, dressed in oversize rags, crippled by 

 polio. First, he scampers into the compartment, with a little 

 broom and on all fours like a baby lemur, sweeps the floor 

 briskly and thoroughly, stuffs the recyclable refuse into 

 his baggy shirt, tied tightly round his waist so that things 

 don?t fall out. And then he begs for his wages. Second, 

 just outside the toilet, with his broom tucked under an 

 arm, he is deftly counting his earnings. His eyes are cold 

 and alert, and he is entirely numerate. Third, as the train 

 stops at Durgapur, he tumbles expertly out onto the platform, 

 where three other boys are waiting for him. They are not 

 yet in their teens, also dirty and in oversize rags, but 

 not crippled. They are all carrying behind them, inside 

 their shirts, huge numbers of empty mineral-water bottles, 

 which make them look like hunchbacks. Each of them has a 

 broom as well. One of them picks up the crippled boy who 

 then rides on the older boy?s shoulders, beating on the 

 older boy?s head as if it were a tom-tom. They disappear 

 down the platform, out of the frame of the train window, 

 giggling and chatting and skipping. It is as if the station 

 belongs to them.

 But it doesn?t, and they know 

 this well. Yet they are beginning to be called the ?railway 

 children? nowadays ? often to the chagrin of the railway 

 officers? wives ? by the law-keepers, the media and the 

 few NGOs who work with them. They are a growing, rag-tag 

 band of children, numbering many thousands, who live, move 

 and work across the length and breadth of the country, using 

 its massive railways network ? the trains as well as the 

 station premises ? to conduct the daily business of their 

 lives. No exhaustive survey has been conducted yet of their 

 numbers, histories and living conditions. But if you travel 

 with your eyes open, then you will begin to see them everywhere; 

 and in spite of being so dispersed and mobile, they are 

 seen in little groups, so that it is possible to regard 

 them as an identifiable community of children within the 

 vast and varied universe of the homeless in India.

 Their ages range from three or 

 four (they only need to be able to walk) to eighteen, when 

 they stop being ?children? legally. The most visible are 

 between seven and twelve, for as they grow older, the adult 

 worlds of work, crime or vagrancy take them away. And they 

 are usually boys. The girls get trafficked or go into domestic 

 work. Sometimes there will be a girl or two among them, 

 but they are resented by the boys, and have to battle ? 

 fiercely or cunningly ? to survive in the margins of the 

 group, earning much less than most of the boys.

 What these children have in common 

 is that they have all run away from their families or some 

 form of institutionalized care or confinement (usually the 

 hellish government homes), or else they have chosen or been 

 forced to spend the greater part of their working day away 

 from home. They have left their families because of extreme 

 poverty or domestic violence, often both. The violence may 

 be done to them, or could be between their parents. Very 

 often, the father has run away with another woman, or simply 

 deserted his family, leaving the mother and children to 

 fend for themselves, forcing the boys to go out, earn and 

 send money back home. In such cases, the trains and stations 

 often happen to be the nearest and most accommodating source 

 of work. Some of them have lost their families to natural, 

 political or economic calamities ? earthquakes, cyclones, 

 droughts, floods, giant waves, evictions, pogroms, insurgency, 

 the shutting down of mills and factories. Many of them have 

 been simply abandoned by their families at a very early 

 age because of poverty, so that they have no memory of home 

 or kin. Some are too mad or disabled to be looked after 

 at home. And now there must also be a growing, but still 

 invisible number of AIDS orphans, themselves possibly infected 

 or ill, or weary with having been the carers of their dying 

 parents. 

 What kind of work do the railway 

 children do? Most of them sweep the trains, so that the 

 little five-rupee broom of rushes has almost become their 

 countrywide symbol. They refer to it, grinning, as their 

 ?tikeet? or ?tik-kut?, and it could be a ticket 

 to many things ? a quick visit home, a trip to the mountains 

 when it gets unbearably hot in the plains, to see Shah Rukh 

 shooting on Chowpatty beach or Prosenjit in Digha. Many 

 of them simply beg. But increasingly, they prefer to do 

 something in exchange of the money. This is frequently some 

 form of entertainment or performance ? playing Ram, Lakshman 

 or the Hanuman, for which costumes, make-up, weaponry, script 

 and choreography are created ingeniously out of collective 

 refuse and memory. Sometimes, the begging itself is a feat 

 of role-playing, acting out blindness, muteness and other 

 forms of disability. Some are expert magicians, keeping 

 the passengers entertained while their comrades pick a few 

 pockets. A few of these gangs are run by adult criminals, 

 who might also abuse the boys sexually, apart from taking 

 away most of their money and keeping them addicted to a 

 range of substances ? but more about addiction, especially 

 to dendrite, later. Then there are the porters, followed 

 by the collectors of bottles, foils and other recyclable 

 trash. And symbolically at the bottom of the ladder, although 

 they do not earn badly, are the shoe-polish boys, who, once 

 they move on to ?higher? jobs (selling packaged food or 

 working at the tea-stalls), will never again stoop to polishing 

 shoes. A railway child may earn up to a hundred rupees per 

 day, sometimes even more.

 These are then, by all legal and 

 international definitions, child labourers. But they are 

 most often self-employed, and therefore have an unusual 

 degree of control over their own earnings, expenses, savings, 

 and working hours and conditions. Or, from another point 

 of view, the coercive and abusive factors compelling their 

 work are so systemic and pervasive that these factors remain 

 hidden, creating an illusion of autonomy and self-regulation. 

 (But there is a real and crucial ambivalence here, to which 

 we will come back later.) So, although most of the children 

 are illiterate or early drop-outs, they usually acquire 

 a range of important skills. They are all numerate, multilingual, 

 and with good memories. They are able to count, keep their 

 own accounts, read the time, and function as human railway 

 timetables and platform-and-coach-number guides for themselves 

 and, unstintingly, for others. They have a quick, sharp, 

 intuitive sense of what people are like, and are robustly 

 adaptable to rapid and unpredictable changes in their far-from-child-friendly 

 environments. This is a combination of intuition, motor 

 skills and common sense, an agility and alertness of body 

 and mind that moves, observes, responds, learns, improvises, 

 articulates and endures often to an extraordinary degree. 

 After being and working with these children for a while, 

 educated, middle-class boys of the same age-group might 

 begin to appear strangely inept and helpless, rendered almost 

 useless by protection and respectability ? and this could 

 be a disturbing, disorienting, even alienating experience 

 for the not-so-detached observer, sometimes quite comically 

 so. And frequently, these children are consummate story-tellers, 

 listeners and performers ? talented, energetic singers, 

 painters, ballad-makers and mimics, whose roving, yet collective 

 ways of life make them unwitting cultural producers, transmitters 

 and educators within their peer-groups.

 It is important where they get 

 to sleep at night, and how secure or insecure they feel 

 in these spaces. The station concourse is relatively secure, 

 because there are always lights and people there, although 

 the territorial battles may be fierce. The platforms are 

 risky, because they are patrolled not only by criminals 

 looking to recruit, but also by the Railway Protection Force 

 and the Government Railway Police. A recurring motif in 

 the stories the children tell is the terrifying moment of 

 being beaten awake by men in uniform. While talking about 

 these moments, the children express something that comes 

 very close to political outrage. If there has been a theft 

 on the premises, then the children, even when asleep, are 

 the automatic suspects, provoking further punishment. If 

 they have lost their brooms at night, and go looking for 

 them in the compartments, then too they run the risk of 

 being taken for thieves. (The entire drama of their relationship 

 with authority and power on the railway premises will be 

 explored in the next article.) The children also become 

 sexually active quite early. They often have sex with one 

 another, or with diverse adults who share the station premises 

 with them, including lunatics and deaf-mutes, often inside 

 abandoned carriages in the yards. Since they earn their 

 own money, they go to sex-workers quite frequently, the 

 more motherly among whom treat them often with extra-professional 

 indulgence. The sex is, of course, almost always unprotected.

 At night, as they sleep entangled 

 with one another, the traumas begin to emerge. In spite 

 of being exhausted, they are usually disturbed sleepers. 

 Talking in sleep, nightmares, and bed-wetting are common. 

 It is as if, with sleep and the end of work and play, their 

 lives change key.

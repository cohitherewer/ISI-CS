 ALL HE NEEDED WAS A THIN EDGE OFF THE BAT

 OBITUARY

 Eknath Solkar (1948-2005)

 Eknath Solkar epitomized the very old cricketing belief that catches win matches. It is difficult to imagine India?s victory against England at the Oval in 1971 without Solkar?s outstanding catches at forward short-leg.

 Cricket fans in Calcutta will also recall some of the catches he held in Eden Gardens when India defeated the English side captained by Tony Lewis. Especially outstanding was the catch he took off Lewis who had attempted a sweep, and all eyes had followed the bat and then to the boundary. Except of course Solkar. Lewis had missed the line, got an inside edge on to his pads and the result was a flying catch by Solkar. Tony Lewis was so aghast that he stood there before he walked to the pavilion.

 Solkar?s catching abilities have become the stuff of legends. Unfortunately, he came to cricket before the advent of television in India ? and in the rest of the world long before the current level of sophisticated camera coverage. So most of Solkar?s catches have gone unrecorded or have been recorded very badly by current standards. The achievements of Jonty Rhodes have been captured for posterity on camera. But those of Solkar, like those of the other fielding legend, Colin Bland, have become part of cricketing lore. This is perhaps just as it should be because almost all the legends of cricket are part of an oral tradition.

 Solkar came to prominence when Indian test cricket was in the middle of a transition spearheaded by Tiger Pataudi. There were two aspects to the transition. One was an unprecedented emphasis on fielding. Here Tiger led by example: he was outstanding in the covers or anywhere in the outfield even though he could see properly with one eye. The other aspect was bowling, where the focus shifted overwhelmingly in favour of spinners. These two aspects had a remarkable fit. Spin bowlers cannot succeed unless catches are held and stumpings are made. Spinners lure batsmen to get a thin edge, to misread the flight, to play the lofted drive and so on. All these provide catching opportunities.

 In an earlier generation, India had great spinners. Think of Vinoo Mankad, Subhash Gupte and Gulam Ahmed. But nobody held catches off their bowlings, nobody fielded close to the bat.

 From the late Sixties, all this changed. When the famous spin quartet bowled, Solkar, Wadekar, Abid Ali and Venkataraghavan (when he wasn?t bowling) fielded in crucial close in positions like slip, gully, leg slip and forward short-leg. Solkar was superlative and the others were good. With the spinners and the catching, suddenly it seemed India had a winning combination. Solkar was perhaps the most important figure in the combination.

 The importance given to Solkar?s close catching often puts into shadow other aspects of his cricket. He was also a superb fielder in the outfield: a swift runner with a beautiful one-action pick-up and throw. In a test match one seldom got to see this, but those who saw him at the Ranji Trophy level will remember his wonderful fielding in the country.

 Solkar was also a very gutsy batsman who at one time became India?s Mr Dependable because he always scored in a crisis. His strokeplay was limited. He played within the V most of the time but he could cut spinners with power.

 Solkar was a thorough team-man who was always in the game batting, bowling or fielding. He was born to cricket despite his humble origins. His confidence in his abilities made him traverse the distance between the P.J. Hindu Gymkhana to Lord?s. 

 When God breathed life into Eknath Solkar, He said, ?Go and stand at forward short-leg.?? And didn?t he just.

 Letters to Editor

 For the rich only

 Sir ? The editorial, ?Left Enlightenment? (Sept 4), gloats over the contribution of the chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, to the development of West Bengal. Bhattacharjee?s vision of a modern Bengal may enthuse the lot of industrialists, promoters, real estate agents and the nouveau riche, but it is enough to consign farmers, the poor, and government employees to oblivion. The flyovers, shopping malls, plush apartments, in and around Rajarhat, New Town and VIP Road, have been erected at the expense of the poor who have been forcibly evicted from their land. The self-declared guardian of the proletariat is seeing to it that the bourgeoisie is kept in good humour by sacrificing the interests of the weaker sections of the society. 

 Earlier, the left opposed the introduction of technology in the government sector. Now, with the government?s zeal for technological advancement, the security of government employees is at stake. The creamy layer of the society may be impressed by the chief minister?s antics but Bhattacharjee will be bereft of the support of the majority of people in the state.

 Yours faithfully,

Kajal Chatterjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? I see nothing wrong in comparing the West Bengal chief minister with Gautama Buddha. Bhattacharjee, once a staunch Marxist, has come a long way to become a messiah for his beleaguered state. And like the Buddha, Bhattacharjee has had to renounce old dogmas and beliefs during his long and arduous journey to enlightenment. We hope that the story of his enlightenment will find its place in the ?Marxist jatakas? if one is written in the future.

 Yours faithfully,

Subroto Dey, Calcutta

 Sir ? The likes of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, Anil Biswas and Biman Bose are no economists, but Marxists who are against the idea of a laissez-faire economy. Yet they have taken it upon themselves to augment the process of industrialization in West Bengal. In the process, farmers would be thrown out of their lands and cottage industries threatened with closure in the face of competition from technologically advanced competitors. If Bengalis, who have long been ousted from the field of trade and commerce, face a similar fate in agriculture and cottage industries, their very identity will be at stake. Do the left leaders know that investors are flocking to Bengal only to earn profit, and not to create employment opportunities for thousands of unemployed Bengali youth? Such ventures are technology-driven and require very little human capital, so as to optimize profits. This kind of industrial development would only result in Bengalis losing their position of prominence even at home. 

 Yours faithfully,

 The plot thickens

 Sir ? The news of Preeti Jain conspiring to kill film-maker, Madhur Bhandarkar, has exposed the nexus between the film industry and the underworld yet again (?Preeti put through lie detector test?, Sept 14). Today our actors are making news not for their acting but for flaunting criminal connections. Sanjay Dutt, Salman Khan, Mandakini, Monica Bedi and now Preeti Jain, are but a few examples of celebrities having close ties with the underworld for personal gain. Our stars are so ensconced in the material world that fame and money matter more than people?s lives or the nation?s interest. Young people should stop idolizing filmstars so that future citizens of our country are also discouraged from emulating their ways and their cosmetic personalities.

 Yours faithfully,

Amrit Amlan Patnaik, Cuttack

 Sir ? A woman scorned can be more dangerous than a serpent. Even if one were to argue that Preeti Jain had hired a killer to bump off Madhur Bhandarkar, it could only be to take revenge on him. Bhandarkar is no angel and one cannot absolve him of the charges of exploiting the actress. If he were to be killed, the finger of suspicion would have been raised at Jain anyways. So why did Preeti decide to take such a step? Was it because she was so hurt by Bhandarkar?s conduct that she decided to kill him regardless of the consequences ? life imprisonment or even death ? Moreover, Bhandarkar was not the only director to have denied Jain a job. Then why did she target him alone? 

 Unfortunately for Preeti, it will not be easy for her to prove Bhandarkar?s crime, something which led to the courts sparing the director. The actress is not getting the sympathy she deserves because a woman cannot expect such favours in a male-dominated world. This episode should serve as an eye opener to aspiring starlets who flock to Mumbai studios to make it big in the world of films at any cost. 

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

 Sir ? Controversies are a dime a dozen in Bollywood. Salman khan was once charged with shooting a black buck while Sanjay Dutt was an accused in the Mumbai blasts even earlier. And now we have the Preeti Jain episode which has left the average citizen slightly confused. First, the actress accused Madhur Bhandarkar of sexually exploiting her. Later, Jain was arrested by the Mumbai police for hatching a conspiracy to kill the film director. Can someone please explain who the real culprit is? One cannot really be sure whether Preeti is the real victim or if Bhandarkar has been falsely implicated by the actress.

 Yours faithfully,

Joyita Mukherjee, Ranchi

 Parting shot

 Sir ? England?s dream of winning the Ashes has come true after 18 long years. England were playing good cricket of late, thanks to a bunch of talented young cricketers. The Australians, on the other hand, looked a jaded lot. While the English bowlers made the lives of rival batsmen miserable, the Australians bowled below par during the series. In the end, Andrew Flintoff?s all-round showing helped his side notch up a memorable win against their archrivals.

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Das Gupta, Calcutta

 NEW ROUTE

 In Kashmir, firecrackers greeted the news that the Srinagar-Muzaffarbad bus route was to become operative from April 7. It is perhaps the decision with the greatest immediate impact to come out of the meeting of the Union minister for external affairs, Mr Natwar Singh, and Pakistani political leaders in Islamabad. For people on both sides, the psychological and emotional significance of the decision to open up a route unused for 58 years is overwhelming. All they need is an entry permit, not a passport. This last decision is symptomatic of the gentle mutual nudging by which India and Pakistan have gradually come to the point they have. One of the problems around the reopening of the road route had been India?s insistence on passports and Pakistan?s desire that the bus be run under the auspices of the United Nations. Even last September, in the meeting between Mr Singh and his Pakistani counterpart, Mr Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri, in New Delhi to discuss, among other things, the opening up of transport links, this was not fully resolved. But both sides have moved a step, and the result has been a scheme which will allow all Indian and Pakistani citizens to travel easily across the border. This is not a tourist bus, but a vehicle that could ensure, if circumstances are kind, regular and almost ?normal? contact between the people of the two countries after years of segregation.

 The emphasis on bilateralism is reassuring. The easing of relations had begun to gather energy, in spite of interruptions, since the ceasefire along the line of control in November 2003. While Kashmir remains at the heart of intransigence, all the other moves ? plans for the opening of the Khokrapar-Munabao rail route and the Amritsar-Lahore bus route, for discussions relating to nuclear security, to the security of fishermen, to the details of the Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline and to the upgrading of trade and economic ties ? show a willingness on both sides to deal directly and fruitfully with each other. People are eager to continue a contact that is beginning to look possible, and no political leader can ignore the groundswell of growing trust and sentiment. India and Pakistan appear to be edging towards the positives in the situation: improvement in trade, understanding in everyday situations and practical matters. The areas of thin ice might show up more clearly in contrast to the ties of interest.

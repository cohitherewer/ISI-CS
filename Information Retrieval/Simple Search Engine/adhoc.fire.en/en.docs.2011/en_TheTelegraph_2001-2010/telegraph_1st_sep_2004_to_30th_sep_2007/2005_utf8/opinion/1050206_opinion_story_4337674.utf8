 Letters to Editor

 It?s only make believe

 Sir ? The back page of the February 4 edition has a picture of Nicole Richie, Lionel Richie?s daughter. According to the caption, she stars with Paris Hilton in a television ?reality show?. Where is the reality or even the entertainment of showing two daughters of the rich and famous doing an ?ordinary? job? They know that they can leave at any time. Both Richie and Hilton are attractive young women and I wish them well. But I cannot suspend my disbelief so far as to be able to watch such a show and regard it as ?realistic?. 

 Yours faithfully,

Stuart Forster, Bangalore

 Good show

 Sir ? Narain Karthikeyan deserves more than a pat on the back for becoming the first Indian to enter the Formula One circuit (?Enter the F1 Indian?, Feb 2). His achievement is more than creditable because few Indians have taken to the sport which requires large investments of capital. Karthikeyan has shown tenacity and toiled hard to get this far. More business houses should come forward to sponsor him, since his performance has been improving consistently over the past few seasons. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Sir ? Sania Mirza?s making it to the second round of the Australian Open and now, Narain Karthikeyan?s debut in the F1 circuit show how a few talented youngsters, guided by experienced coaches and seniors and overcoming the limitations of infrastructure and resources, are establishing themselves among the best in the world. In the process, they are setting examples for others to follow. Their performances might also spark interest in these ?unconventional? sports. The success of these two is a sign that a wind of change is blowing through the sports arena. There may be problems like lack of infrastructure, funds and proper management, but the confidence, optimism and drive of these sportspersons should send the message to the administration to improve its systems and policies, and prove to the world that cricket and hockey are not the only two games in which India does well.

 Yours faithfully,

Safiuddin Khan, Aligarh

 Sir ? With the success of Sania Mirza and Narain Karthikeyan, the monotony of cricket will soon be history. Every Indian, perhaps with exception of Mandira Bedi, must be happy.

 Yours faithfully,

Bappa Kanta Pal, Calcutta

 Sir ? Narain Karthikeyan?s success can be placed alongside India?s few and far between achievements in the world of sport so far ? the almost forgotten hockey golds, and the individual performances of Prakash Padukone, the Krishnans, Paes and Bhupati, P.T. Usha, Vishwanathan Anand, P. Gopichand and recently Raghavendra Singh Rathore, Anju George and Sania Mirza. Given India?s population, this success rate is discouraging, to say the least. All who were successful had exemplary will and groomed themselves, spending their own money, with very little support from the state. While the state does groom a few promising young sportspersons for world competitions, there are hundreds in other countries who are far better. So the medals continue to elude us. Also some of our youngsters who reach the top at the junior level fail to make it at the senior level. Indians, in general, are not powerfully built compared to Westerners and Africans, and so policy-makers should lay stress on games of skill where we are more likely to succeed. Indians want results ? how long will players and coaches continue to be sacked when the results allude us?

 Yours faithfully,

K.B. Goswami, Calcutta

 Letters to Editor

 Stop pretending

 Sir ? It is hard to believe the levels Indian politics can sink to. Are we now expected to think that the solution to all caste-related problems is abolishing surnames (?Slash surname to kill caste?, Oct 15)? The National Commission for Scheduled Castes seems to have lost all sense of direction. There are ample laws and policies for backward castes enshrined in our Constitution and guaranteed by our courts. The commission should be lobbying with the government to implement these laws in far-flung rural areas and to make them more effective, rather than come up with ridiculous ideas. Will social hierarchies automatically vanish if a low-caste person suddenly drops his surname? Discriminations will continue, and the only way to resolve them is through institutional reform and the introduction of market-friendly policies that would ensure that only the best are hired by employers, irrespective of their caste status. For reservations contribute to the social exclusion of low-caste people, who are seen to make it through the backdoor. More fundamentally, the emancipation of one cannot lie in the deprivation of another. 

 What is frustrating is that the Congress has reportedly accepted the proposal ?on principle?. Even the Bharatiya Janata Party has not been as emphatic in its rejection. Indians would make themselves the laughing stock of the world if they flaunt this kind of social egalitarianism.

 Yours faithfully,

Aruni Mukherjee, Coventry, UK

 Sir ? The proposed move to drop surnames will go a long way in checking casteism. But this alone will not help. Other steps such as the abolition of caste-based organizations and, more certainly, a ban on caste-based political propaganda should be enforced. That casteism is a thriving force even among the educated in the country?s metropolises can be evinced from the matrimonial columns of newspapers, almost all of which announce the castes of the would-be brides and bridegrooms. This should be stopped as well. However, together with the dropping of the Hindu surname, the reservation policy should also be banned. For it would be senseless to cling to one evil while abolishing another.

 Yours faithfully,

Sujit De, Sodepur

 Sir ? The recommendation of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes to abolish Hindu surnames is laudable. But will it ensure that scheduled castes refrain from highlighting their caste status in application forms for higher education or government jobs? The reservation policy of the state is itself based on a discriminatory principle, which has made the lower castes ?neo-Brahmins? and killed the competitive spirit in Indian society. Only when SCs desist from making use of their caste status and the state abolishes its reservation policy will the caste system fall into disuse.

 Yours faithfully,

Kajal Chatterjee, Sodepur

 Sir ? When there is no effort to banish discrimination in society, efforts like dropping surnames can have no meaning. Besides, why should the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes be denied their identity and their rightful share in society and governance by this incredible policy? It is good that surnames symbolize caste. Otherwise, everyone would claim the facilities and advantages that accrue to SCs and STs.

 Yours faithfully,

Diptimoy Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir ? Just imagine the nightmare that awaits the Election Commission if the recommendation of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes is implemented. Innumerable Manmohans, Buddhadebs and Pranabs, some living in the same city, same area and even house. And given that innumerable people in this country still do not have their photo-identity cards, any election would become a farce since the confusion of identities would enable the parties to rig the polls as much as they please. Little wonder, the commission?s recommendation has been greeted with so much enthusiasm by political parties.

 Yours faithfully,

J. Acharya, Calcutta

 Toys that kill

 Sir ? There?s an innocuous two liner, ?Fatal trip for family? in the October 13 edition of The Telegraph, which, in not so many words, says that Sailen Biswas was responsible for the death of his wife and child for using a mobile phone when driving his motorbike. While one is understandably sorry for his loss, which is irreparable, can there be any reason why he should not be booked for culpable homicide? It is because of the failure to hold people like him accountable for their follies that culprits evade responsibility. Not only did Biswas put his family at tremendous risk, but he could have also caused grievous harm to those around him. 

 The issue brings us to the conduct of mobile phone-users in India. Fads breed like mosquitoes here. But we should be more aware of the public nuisance we create and learn to respect the privacy of others around us. Those who go around with these toys are completely oblivious of the basics of civic conduct. It is for the police to ensure that this irresponsibility does not overtake our much-hyped march to commercial revolution. One does not have to make an effort to spot people screaming into their sets to carry on what is supposed to be a private conversation, or spoiling an evening in the movies or at an concert, in spite of requests by organizers to behave. What is most offensive is that those with the most expensive toys are the most irresponsible. 

 Yours faithfully,

Amajit Das, Calcutta

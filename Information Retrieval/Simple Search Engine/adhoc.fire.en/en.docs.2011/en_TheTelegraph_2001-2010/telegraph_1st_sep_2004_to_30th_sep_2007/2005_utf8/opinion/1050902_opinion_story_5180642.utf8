 CARRYING THE OLD BAGGAGE

 JOURNEY OF THE UPANISHADS TO THE WEST,

 By Swami Tathagatananda,

 Advaita Ashrama, Rs 180

 In his famous lecture at the Asiatic Society in 1786, William Jones declared that Sanskrit, as a language, was more perfect than Greek, more copious than Latin, and more exquisitely refined than either. He speculated that all three might ?have sprung from some common source, which, perhaps, no longer exists.? This speech became the cornerstone of comparative philology and precursor of European orientalism, which branched off into Indology.

 This book is a scholarly and exhaustive history of Indology. The author highlights interactions of the ancient Indian and Greek culture and goes on to show how the translations of Vedic and Upanishadic texts brought about radical changes in the standard European perception of India. William Jones?s translation of Shakuntala fired the imagination of German poets and philosophers. The author also takes stock of the way oriental studies boosted American transcendental movements and generated Russia?s interest in Vedanta.

 The sincere effort that has gone into the making of the book is laudable. But questions remain. We cannot quite figure out why the title mentions the Upanishads alone, and not the other ancient Indian texts that made similar journeys. A more intriguing problem lies elsewhere. We should ask, in the post-Said era, if it is at all possible to conceive of ?orientalism? as an unproblematized, unchequered and apolitical domain as Tathagatananda does. 

 The Orient, especially India, was ?structured? and ?restructured? in European epistemological framework throughout the 19th century. At times, it was used as a cognitive model to refute other competing European models and at other times, it served the Romantic notion of resuscitating a degenerate Christian culture. India, being spoken for, emerged both as a theme and as a tool for Europe to make use of in its own interest.

 What Said?s thesis does is counter-balance the kind of near-hyperbolic appreciation of Indology that authors like Tathagatananda routinely engage in. The author admits this somewhat unwillingly when he quotes Monier-Williams: ?to promote translation of the Scriptures into Sanskrit, so as to enable his countrymen to proceed in the conversion of the natives of India to the Christian religion?. Indology?s disregard for Indian culture is another area left uncharted by Tathagatananda.

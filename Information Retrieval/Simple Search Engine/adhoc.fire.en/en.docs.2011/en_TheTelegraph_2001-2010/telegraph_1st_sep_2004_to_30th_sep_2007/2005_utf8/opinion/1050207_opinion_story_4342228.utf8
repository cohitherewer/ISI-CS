 Letters to Editor

 New face of old evil

 Sir ? ?Want to vote? Get a husband first? (Feb 3), is a last ditch attempt of the Haryanvi patriarchy to retain its hold over its property ? the women. As Gajinder Singh himself showed in ?As women come into their own? (Sept 22, 2004), women in the state are increasingly becoming aware of their plight ? lack of education, torture, harassment, the uneven work load in the family, the absence of property rights and so on. The women in Haryana are now discarding the veil, getting themselves educated, and worse, refusing to get married to uneducated, unsympathetic men who will treat them like mules or child-bearing animals. Of all these, the most fearsome is the last. For in a state with a tradition of female infanticide and a screwed up sex ratio, such a decision is bound to be devastating. Hence the pressure on the women to marry or forsake their voting rights. 

 Yours faithfully,

M. Srivastava, Calcutta

 Watch out

 Sir ? There should be no doubts about the intentions of King Gyanendra (?Drastic steps?, Feb 2). He dismissed the government headed by Sher Bahadur Deuba because he wishes to rule the country himself. The reason cited for the dismissal is Deuba?s failure to deal with the Maoists. But will the monarch be able to tackle them himself, especially given that the rebels? first aim is to do away with royalty? King Gyanendra?s ambitions were not entirely unknown even when his elder brother, Birendra, was alive. With the latter?s line exterminated now, it is an easy job for Gyanendra. But even while criticizing Nepal, we have to remember that multi-party parliamentary democracy is not deep-rooted in many parts of the world, not even in India.

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, 

 Jamshedpur

 Sir ? The emergency in Nepal will invariably make the Maoist insurgents increase their activity in the Indo-Nepal border. Instead of making any irresponsible statement on a matter that is primarily internal to Nepal, India should limit itself to minimizing disturbance on this side of the border.

Yours faithfully, 

Siddhartha Raj Guha, Jabalpur 

 Sir ? The Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) has described the action of King Gyanendra as a ?medieval feudal autocracy? (?A king stages a coup?, Feb 2). But his actions, like snapping connection with the outer world and the display of military might (armoured cars for instance) on the streets of the state capital have an uncanny resemblance to that of the Chinese government during the Tiananmen Square incident. The political development in Nepal sounds more like an army-sponsored coup in an impoverished south Asian or sub-Saharan country than a move to promote democracy. We can only hope that Nepal attracts more international censure as China did after the Tiananmen Square massacre.

 Yours faithfully,

Chameli Pal, Batanagar

 Sir ? ?Coup in Kathmandu? (Feb 2) shows that the Indian government has been prompt in its action on Nepal. Yet, had it acted with more alacrity before, when the Maoist insurgency was gathering force, the situation in Nepal would not have gone out of control. But India opted to wait and watch rather than adopt an aggressive policy.

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad

 Sir ? Where Nepal is concerned, it is a tightrope walk for India. We cannot overtly criticize the action of the king of Nepal, nor support it. Yet the stakes are high for India as serious works like the opening of a consulate in Birgunj had begun to take shape. India will have to prudently use its economic capability (India had announced an aid of Rs 76 million for medical care and education) to allure the monarch to restore democracy in the country as soon as possible.

 Yours faithfully,

Sumana Roy, Shyamnagar

 Sir ? There have been reports of growing Chinese influence in Nepal. Also Nepal?s decision to close down the dalai lama?s office in Kathmandu is being viewed with concern in New Delhi. India must tread cautiously in the coming weeks.

 Yours faithfully,

J.S. Acharya, Hyderabad

 Sir ? It is a pity that on the same day that the government called the events in Nepal a ?violation of the constitution?, we had a governor dismissing an elected government in Goa. It was a reminder of the Fifties, when the Kerala government was dismissed similarly. Should we not be more concerned about the violation of our own Constitution than that in Nepal?

 Yours faithfully,

Arunava Choudhury, Calcutta

 After examination

 Sir ? We have examined the incident that was reported under ?Youth pays for rail puff protest? published on Feb 1. Samresh Kumar Panda, 23, son of Puran Chandra Panda, resident of Baluja, under Mancheswar police station of Khurda, had gone to New Delhi on his first visit after running away from his family. He boarded the general compartment of Purushottam Express at Delhi on January 25 for his journey back.

 On Jan 26, around 7.30 pm, Samresh Panda, after smoking, went near the lavatory and opened the door of the general compartment to throw the butt of his cigarette. In the process, he slipped down. He has categorically mentioned in his statement to the GRP that nobody had thrown him outside the coach. He was detected lying near the ?I? cabin on the morning of Jan 27 by the GRP. He was given first aid and taken to the Bokaro General Hospital?s casualty ward. His brother arrived from his village and took him there on Jan 28. Incidentally, Samresh Panda was not in possession of a ticket.

 Yours faithfully,

Debashis Chandra, chief public relations officer, South Eastern Railway, 

Calcutta

 Letters to Editor

 Heart of the matter

 Sir ? Everyone knows that she has beautiful eyes ? which she has famously pledged to donate ? but it is good to know that Aishwarya Rai has a bleeding heart as well (?Ash treks to Tirupati?, Jan 14). Probably, Vivek Oberoi has told her all about the terrible condition of the tsunami victims. But wait ? have our media missed something? Did the tsunami make its way over land and up to the Tirupati temple? Or why should Rai walk 15 kilometres up the Tirumala hills and deposit bundles of currency and jewellery in the temple hundi for the said victims? A trek down the still-picturesque shores somewhere near Nagapattinam would have been nicer and more to the point, one would have thought. But perhaps, there were no deities in those places who could be appeased to prop up a sagging career.

 Yours faithfully,

 Against the grain

 Sir ? Ashok V. Desai?s comments on randomly selected passages from Vandana Shiva?s essays in ?Mad sacred cows? (Jan 11) hardly constitute an informed critique of the issues involved. His sarcasm cannot hide his often deliberate misreading. An informed and rational debate about the socio-economic effects of globalization on ecological and environmental sustainability is sorely needed. Sadly, Desai contributes nothing to it. In some instances, his responses are incoherent and nonsensical. In responding to Shiva?s comments about transgenic crops, Desai talks about inter-racial mating which has no connection to the issue under discussion. Transgenic crops arise when genes of one species of plants are artificially introduced into another. Desai obviously does not realize that different races of humans are not distinct species. 

 Desai would also do well to find out the effects of privatization of water resources on impoverished blacks in South Africa. I wonder if he will travel to South African ghettos to get first-hand experience, just as he travelled to Switzerland to learn more about cows. The downfall of Enron, and the results of the privatization of power that it championed may have faded from Desai?s memory, but it is another example of the abuse of essential resources by private companies.

 Many of Shiva?s warnings about the dangers of corporate control of essential resources merit consideration. Admittedly, some of her views are simplistic and deserve criticism. Desai may feel that he has nothing to learn from activists like Shiva. But it would be tragic if such close-mindedness and wilful ignorance sway policy-makers into discarding well-founded criticisms of globalization. Doing so may prove to be costly for the human race in the long run.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Ashok V. Desai has delivered a message that is so needed in India today ? that most so-called sympathizers of the poor are misguided, and despite all their good intentions, end up entrenching poverty further. Desai correctly argues that framing economic policy with the underlying assumption that India is, and will remain, a predominantly agricultural economy is starting out on a wrong foot. The reason why Indian agriculture suffers from low productivity is because there are too many people employed in this sector. 

 It is all very well to ensure that the farmer gets a certain price for his crops, but why should the Indian consumer suffer as a result? If as the populists say, 70 per cent of Indians are farmers and thus need protection, then it follows that 70 per cent of all Indian consumers are also farmers. Agricultural exports tend to be price elastic, and a cheaper product will boost demands for the farmers? produce. When the G20 finally manages to get the US and EU to cut farm subsidies, and eventually it will happen, we will no longer be able to support our farmers. Isn?t it better to slowly prepare them for the brave new world? 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Ashok V. Desai ridicules the ecological arguments presented in the work of Vandana Shiva. Obviously, for him technological progress is a new ?sacred cow?. In his eagerness to mock, Desai fails to see that the capitalist argument for industrialized agriculture and genetic modification of crops is justified by appeals to Western fears of the world?s ?unchecked? population rise. This, of course, is just the sort of misinformation that the agro-industrial lobby hopes for and exploits. The point is not that we continue to increase production at the cost of irreversible environmental degradation. The answer must be, as Shiva and many others argue convincingly, that we learn to use more efficiently the available resources. But shareholders are not interested in logic; their goal is clear, myopic, and terrifying? immediate monetary gain at any and all costs. Similarly, Desai?s ignorance of innumerable international trade and monetary instruments that do, or seek strenuously to, make natural water resources of nations saleable commodities is appalling. Even if he presents his odd ideas in the guise of humour, Desai?s arrogance is dangerous.

 Yours faithfully,

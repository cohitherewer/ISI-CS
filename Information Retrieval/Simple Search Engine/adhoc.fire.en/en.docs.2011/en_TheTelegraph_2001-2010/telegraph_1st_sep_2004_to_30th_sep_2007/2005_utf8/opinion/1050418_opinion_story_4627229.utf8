 GRUESOME CITY

 The gruesome is a part of life in Calcutta. It is encountered most often in the city?s hospitals. The government hospitals offer their own versions of hell, especially to the poor. For more affluent city-dwellers, the upmarket private hospitals and nursing homes provide their own brand of infernal harassment. Two recent incidents starkly bring out this two-fold reality. An elderly diabetic patient fell down on his way to the toilet at the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, and was left entirely unattended until he bled to death. No doctors or nurses noticed this medicine-ward patient bleeding to death. Ayahs are now banned inside state-run hospitals, and for those who do not have family members keeping vigil by their bedside, most of these under-staffed hospitals offer no guarantee against perishing like this old man. 

 Meanwhile, at the Apollo Gleneagles Hospital, the wrong body was given out to the family of the deceased. The daughter of the deceased cremated the body, and then realized what had happened. The hospital has now held the family responsible for mistaking the identity of the body. But this was a case of severe burns, and the hospital allegedly misled the family into believing that they were claiming the right body. The right body has now been lying in the hospital morgue for three days, and the family has been unable to get it back since the police-and-courts red-tape has now become impossibly complicated. Moreover, the hospital seems to be putting pressure on the family to take the blame for the mistaken identification. The other family, whose deceased member has been cremated by the wrong family, is charging the hospital with negligence and intrigue. Each family is now in the midst of its own nightmare, aided by the hospital authorities. In the earlier case, CMC hospital has made the usual noises about an inquiry but hundreds of such inquiries are in process, some of them into criminal negligence on a far larger scale. This kind of extreme harassment of people who are, in any case, at the end of their tether with stress and bereavement is perhaps one of the worst consequences of an entire infrastructure of care and services gone horribly out of control. With the government and police callously indifferent to such extremity, and the consumer redressal machinery still in its fledgling stage, such nightmares will remain common occurrences in West Bengal.

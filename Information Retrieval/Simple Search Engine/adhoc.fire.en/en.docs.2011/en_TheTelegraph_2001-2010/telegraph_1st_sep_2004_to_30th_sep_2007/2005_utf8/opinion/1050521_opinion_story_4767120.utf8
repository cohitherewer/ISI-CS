 DEVIL

 Funny how fans protest Man Us takeover by an American billionaire when the club has always placed business above football

FOR 

THE RECORD

Clubs 

history of soul-selling:

 Refusing to defend the FA cup in favour of a money-spinning 

tournament in Brazil

 Exclusive TV deals with Rupert Murdochs 

BskyB, including the launch of MUTV

 Aggressive marketing of replica kits and memorabilia

 Floating on the London Stock Exchange

 Previous selling of large stakes to tycoons to 

the chagrin of fans.

 Sing when youre winning. You only sing when youre winning.

 This British terrace chant (bizarrely sung to the tune of Cuban folk song, Guantanamera) neatly illustrates the two types of football fan in this world. In the home stands are those who stick by a team with whom they enjoy some sort of connection through thick and thin (or through thin and thin to be more accurate).

 In the away stands are the glory hunters. The ones who regard a football shirt as a fashion accessory. The ones who would gladly switch allegiances at the missing of a penalty. The ones who have probably never visited the city of their side let alone attended a match. The Imaginary Madridians as opposed to the Real Madridians. The Man Urinals rather than the Man Uniteds.

 But wait! The Red Devils are ablaze in fury! Not for Sale! they cry out loud. And all this coming from the club which was the first to jump into bed with Rupert Murdoch. The club which dismissed the FA Cup one season as holders in favour of a TV tournament in Brazil. The club that goes on endless promotional tours across South-East Asia and the States. The club that uses smaller clubs as farms for young players. The club that measures itself on the FTSE 100. The club that has shown no qualms in the past about moving from FC to Plc.

 Aww bless!

 The protracted takeover bid concluded this past week by American billionaire Michael Glazer has been well documented. As has been the clubs poor season. After two seasons without the league title since the inception of the Premier League, the FA Cup final later today ironically heralds the one chance the club has of ensuring there will be no cobwebs in the trophy cabinet. There will be no holidays to Brazil this time.

 The takeover saga has been blamed by some United supporters for this seasons disappointing displays on the pitch. Fans of other clubs ? great and small ? remain by and large unimpressed. United supporters have always been the emperors of excuse-making. Few have forgotten the season when the club changed its away kit three times in order to maximise merchandise sales, and then blamed the colour of one shirt for an embarrassing defeat.

 A visit to Newcastle in turn will evoke an angry harking back to the 1995-6 season. That year witnessed the black and white United challenging the red United for the league championship. As the season approached its climax, Alex Ferguson made the ridiculous claim that teams would not try hard against Newcastle in order to prevent the title going to Old Trafford. This provoked a now legendary rant on live TV by then Newcastle boss Kevin Keegan. The title did eventually end up with Manchester. Some say it was a managerial masterstroke on the part of Ferguson, but most now see it as malicious school playground antics.

 If one sauntered into any other supporters association the length and breadth of the British Isles and sparked this conversation, one would almost certainly be met with this unanimous reply: they brought it on themselves. So what if some Yank who believes football is a game that is played in helmets is taking over? Is it that much different from when the club sold its majority stake to two Irish horse-racing tycoons a few years back? By ceasing to be a football club first and foremost but an enterprise instead, is it not inevitable that the cut-throat nature of capitalism would eventually result in power to the few at the expense of the many? 

 Of course, as a business model Manchester United ? until very recently ? has been the example to which all aspire. They have never tossed away money wildly in the transfer market and have always maintained a tight players wage structure. They realised the potential of satellite television before anyone else. They pioneered aggressive marketing and merchandising in soccer paraphernalia. Above all, they have matched this business acumen with phenomenal success on the pitch.

 Yet, as most fans know: football is fickle. Nobody can win all the time. And if you only sing when youre winning, not many are left standing when the chips are down. It can be argued that the fans attempt to thwart Glazer has failed purely due to lack of numbers. The point can be proven by the fact that so many small clubs in both England and Scotland have been rescued from bankruptcy in recent years purely through fundraising and sheer determination on the part of fans and fans alone ? and without any corporate backing whatsoever.

 In fairness, there are a number of people who support Manchester United for noble reasons. The tragedy of the Munich air crash in 1958 wiping out arguably the most talented group of young players of their generation is still poignant in the memory of all football lovers. 

 The tradition of flair stemming from Charlton, Best and Law (the Englishman, Irishman and Scotsman are still referred to as The Holy Trinity), and continued today by the likes of Giggs, Scholes and Ronaldo, is something to be proud of. Plus the fact that the side has always shown plenty of fighting spirit ? most notably during the last two victory-clinching minutes of the 1999 Champions League final against Bayern Munich ? has attracted millions to the United cause.

 After spending season after season, however, watching Alex Ferguson taunting referees in post-match interviews and winding up fellow managers; Eric Cantonas kung-fu kicks; Roy Keanes vicious tackling and the petulance of first Mr Beckham and now Mr Rooney ? it is hard to take the cries of foul play from the few loyalists in the Stretford End too seriously. In short, at kick-off this evening most Brits will become honorary Gunners (Arsenals nickname) and leave the Red Devil cheering for Rupert Murdoch, the glory hunters and South-East Asia.

 Thats if theyve not all already started supporting Chelsea.

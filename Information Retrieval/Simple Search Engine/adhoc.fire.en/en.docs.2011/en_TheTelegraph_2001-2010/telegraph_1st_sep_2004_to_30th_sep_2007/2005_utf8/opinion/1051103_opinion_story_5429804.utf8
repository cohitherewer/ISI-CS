 THE WEB OF INTERDEPENDENCE

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the Human Development Report 2005

 The state of human development: fifteen years ago, the first Human Development Report looked forward to a decade of rapid progress. ?The Nineties?, it predicted optimistically, ?are shaping up as the decade for human development, for rarely has there been such a consensus on the real objectives of development strategies.? Today...there is also a consensus on development... powerfully expressed in the reports of the UN Millennium Project and the UK-sponsored Commission for Africa. Unfortunately, the consensus has yet to give rise to practical actions ? and there are ominous signs that the next 10 years, unlike the last 15 years, will deliver far less for human development than the new consensus promises.

 Much has been achieved since the first HDR. On average, people in developing countries are healthier, better educated and less impoverished ? and they are more likely in a multiparty democracy. Since 1990, life expectancy in developing countries has increased by 2 years. There are 3 million fewer child deaths annually and 30 million fewer children out of school. More than 130 million people have escaped extreme poverty. These human development gains should not be underestimated.

 Nor should they be exaggerated. In 2003, 18 countries with a combined population of 460 million people registered lower scores on the human development index than in 1990 ? an unprecedented reversal. In the midst of an increasingly prosperous global economy, 10.7 million children every year do not live to see their fifth birthday, and more than one billion people survive in abject poverty on less than one dollar a day. The HIV/AIDS pandemic has inflicted the single greatest reversal in human development. In 2003, the pandemic claimed 3 million lives and left another 5 million people infected. Millions of children have been orphaned. 

 Global integration is forging deeper interconnections between countries. In economic terms, the space between people and countries is shrinking rapidly, as trade, technology and investment link all countries in a web of interdependence. In human development terms the space between countries is marked by deep and, in some cases, widening inequalities in income and life chances. One-fifth of humanity live in countries where many people think nothing of spending $2 a day on a cappuccino. Another fifth of humanity survive on less than $1 a day and live in countries where children die for want of a simple anti-mosquito bednet.

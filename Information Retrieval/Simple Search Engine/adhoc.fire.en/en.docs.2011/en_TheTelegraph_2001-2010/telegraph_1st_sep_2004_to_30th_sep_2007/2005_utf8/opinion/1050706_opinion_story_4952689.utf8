 DEVIL?S WIND

 Terrorism, by its own perverse logic, inevitably strengthens the forces of fundamentalism. The attack on the Ram Janmabhoomi complex in Ayodhya on Tuesday morning was foiled by the counter-insurgency forces stationed on the spot, but the attempt itself will leave its indelible scar on the politics of the country. The full details of the incident, especially the identity of the group that masterminded the attack, will take some time to unfold. But some points are already evident. A group of people, heavily armed with sophisticated guns, grenades and explosives, could move with apparent ease to Faizabad and from there to the temple complex in Ayodhya. This group succeeded in lobbing a grenade and then engaging the security forces in an encounter that lasted over an hour. It would be labouring the obvious on the basis of this evidence to suggest that there was some kind of intelligence lapse involved. What is even more alarming is that this kind of failure seems to be recurring, thus allowing the threat of terrorism to spread from India?s sovereignty in Jammu and Kashmir to its political institutions and now to a religious complex. Pious or enraged words of condemnation are not enough in the given situation. It needs to be reiterated that eternal vigilance is the price of peace.

 There is an obvious political fallout of this incident. The threat to the temple may well provide a shot in the arm to a languishing movement. The Bharatiya Janata Party, as the leader of the National Democratic Alliance, had put the Ram Janmabhoomi movement on the back-burner much to the dismay of the extreme elements in the sangh parivar. But there is now a distinct possibility that the movement might come back into the limelight. The BJP president, Mr L.K. Advani, has already announced that today will be a day of protest led by the BJP. A terrorist attack, by any reckoning an attack on India?s sovereignty, is poised to take a political turn. Mr Advani might may well be experiencing a d?j? vu since in the late Eighties he was the leader of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. But Tuesday?s attack catches him at a moment when he is trying valiantly to refashion his and his party?s politics. The situation, however, places a different kind of challenge before all political parties. The country and its security are above all politics and sectional interests. Not to respond to this challenge and to look at scoring petty political points or to provide unnecessary provocation to communal violence will be a failure that history will not treat kindly.

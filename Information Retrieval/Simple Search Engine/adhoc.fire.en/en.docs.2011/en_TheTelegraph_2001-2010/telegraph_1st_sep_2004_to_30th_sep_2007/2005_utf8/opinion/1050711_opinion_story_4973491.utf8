 LEFT?S NERVES

 It would appear that all that the left leaders wanted was a meeting with Ms Sonia Gandhi. One meeting on Sunday morning with the Congress president seems to have convinced them that the United Progressive Alliance would adhere to the common minimum programme, which they think will be violated if the government goes ahead with the disinvestments in Bhel. It is difficult to comprehend the left?s distrust of Mr Manmohan Singh and his government, and their trust in Ms Gandhi. The left seems to be proceeding on the assumption that Ms Gandhi is a little more sympathetic to its protestations than the prime minister. Till they met the Congress president, the left leaders behaved like petulant children and stayed away from meetings of the coordination committee of the UPA. The grouse of the left is not just about disinvestments in Bhel; it has a bigger and a more fundamental objection. It disapproves of the economic policies being followed by the government. In other words, the left is opposed to economic reforms. This is where the left has to make a difficult choice. If, because of its objections to the government?s economic reforms, the left decides to pull out of the UPA, it creates an opportunity for the Bharatiya Janata Party to attempt a comeback. The left has to choose between its economic ideology and its political goals.

 The left?s confusion is rooted in another contradiction. The economic policies that the left criticizes are exactly the same as the ones pursued by the Left Front government in West Bengal. There is no bigger champion of economic reforms than Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, the chief minister of West Bengal. In his pursuit of investment for West Bengal, Mr Bhattacharjee has adopted policies that go against all that the left has stood for. He has welcomed multinationals, spoken in favour of free markets and has even declared that he agrees to disagree with his comrades in New Delhi. The left?s schizophrenia has become more and more pronounced. Mr Bhattacharjee speaks in one voice about economic reforms and Mr Prakash Karat, the general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), in another. The political fallout of this divergence is difficult to fathom. But it would appear from another divergence ? between words and deeds ? that the left will continue to protest without actually pulling the carpet from under the UPA. A meeting with Ms Gandhi is all that is needed to calm distraught left nerves. How the left tackles its own schizophrenia is a different problem altogether.

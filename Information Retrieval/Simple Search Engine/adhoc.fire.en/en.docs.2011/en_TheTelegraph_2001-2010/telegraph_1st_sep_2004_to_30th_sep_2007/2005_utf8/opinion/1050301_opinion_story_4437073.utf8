 PAVED WITH GOOD INTENTIONS 

 The finance minister believes that 

 with proper education and health most people can take care 

 of themselves if they are not at war. The budget seems to 

 be a statement of this belief, writes Shubhashis Gangopadhyay

 Obviously happy 

 I was travelling and could not 

 get to a television set before the railway budget started. 

 Consequently, I missed all the drama prior to it. In particular, 

 as I sat down to watch Lalooji, I was quite surprised 

 at the relative calm in the house when the railway budget 

 was presented. It was only later that some people told me 

 that the opposition had staged a walkout. As the finance 

 minister was presenting the general budget, I often felt 

 that the opposition had walked out again, as it did during 

 the railway budget. The only time I felt that someone else 

 was in the Lok Sabha was when the finance minister announced 

 the transaction tax on cash withdrawals of more than Rs 

 10,000 in a day. Other than that, I have seldom seen such 

 a quiet budget presentation. 

 Is it because the left was supporting 

 the government and, hence, could not raise the same stink 

 as it does in other years? Was the opposition shell-shocked 

 at a wonderful budget, or would it have been politically 

 incorrect to oppose anything in it? Or, is it because the 

 finance minister seldom said what exactly would be done 

 but assured everybody that everything is under total control?

 To find answers to these questions, 

 let us start at the very beginning. Who will be happy with 

 this budget? True to his image, the finance minister has 

 made it that much easier for those who cannot evade taxes. 

 The fixed income earners have been dutifully filing their 

 taxes each year amidst the perennial fear of increased tax 

 rates in the next year. Leading up to the budget, there 

 was a very deliberate build-up by large sections of the 

 intelligentsia as to why tax rates should be raised! 

 Some, of course, made the usual 

 noises about increasing the tax base, but since they did 

 not have any good plans on how to do this, all fixed income 

 earners were mighty nervous all morning. The budget came 

 as a huge surprise and an even greater relief. Not only 

 have their taxes not increased, but they have actually come 

 down.

 The next set of happy people comprises 

 those companies that announce profits. Their tax on profit 

 has been reduced? Once again, the finance minister has delivered 

 his strongest message ? low tax rates encourage greater 

 tax collections ? and, in the past, he has certainly demonstrated 

 that he is right on this count. Even those that do not announce 

 profits are happy. Some of them, who are in an industry 

 that has apparently been under severe financial distress, 

 will get restructuring packages and subsidies on loans to 

 turn them around. Most important, no one will be held responsible 

 for what has happened. Bad management, or low productivity 

 labour, will both be subsumed under external shocks (that 

 is, outside the control of any one who votes for the government).

 That the stock market is happy 

 is immediately obvious. As the budget unravelled, indexes 

 started rising in a way that did not happen even during 

 his earlier dream budget. Every single financial player 

 interviewed on television gave kudos to the budget. And 

 that is not simply because people were happy that he has 

 not done anything to hamper growth, but it is also because 

 he made the right noises about the financial markets being 

 better at allocating savings for investment. He also talked 

 about modifying archaic financial market regulations made 

 in a bygone era. And he referred to giving the right incentives 

 to the individual saver to decide where to invest. So everybody 

 who feels that India has enough resources but the government 

 has choked off all avenues of exploiting them, is mighty 

 pleased. I happen to be one such person.

 So, who would be unhappy with 

 the budget? The finance minister mentioned a Rs 10 tax on 

 all daily cash withdrawals of more than Rs 10,000 from a 

 bank. This is unacceptable to many. Here they were merrily 

 withdrawing cash to make notional payments on their business 

 to show that they make no profits and hence cannot pay any 

 taxes. Now suddenly, like a bolt from the blue, the fictitious 

 payments can be checked against the bank account of a third 

 party and, hence, cannot easily be hidden. 

 But some ? could be very few ? 

 would argue that the current situation is unfair to honest 

 businesses. If they make ten one-thousand-rupee cheque transactions, 

 they need to pay the bank at a rate of Rs 2 per cheque. 

 But those who are hiding behind cash transactions are paying 

 nothing. Such a move will make at least some move towards 

 non-cash transactions and that is what a modern economy 

 is all about. However, the general feeling is that this 

 measure will be rolled back in parliament. There are too 

 many traders who support the opposition parties.

 Can anyone, who is objective, 

 be truly unhappy with the budget? To answer that question, 

 let us go back one year. Last year?s budget was done in 

 a hurry. The government was new, had just come in after 

 a lot of drama on who would be the prime minister, and time 

 was running out for a complete budgetary exercise. The finance 

 minister, therefore, announced a number of initiatives regarding 

 various task forces, high-powered committees and advisory 

 groups who will work out the details of how to implement 

 the NCMP.

 These pronouncements had built 

 significant amounts of expectation. The prime minister had 

 himself added to such hopeful speculations by urging on 

 more than one occasion that everybody must think ?out of 

 the box? ? he wanted an innovative, not an incremental, 

 approach. And this desire to see some new directions could 

 make some very unhappy.

 It was a bit disappointing to 

 see no specific plan on most of the so-called ?development? 

 initiatives other than more money being made available for 

 existing programmes. The only silver lining here is that 

 the finance minister has indicated that the programmes will 

 be monitored closely. It remains to be seen whether the 

 monitoring is done by the same group that has suggested 

 the programme, or by truly independent bodies. 

 There is a reason for this implied 

 cynicism. Look at all the regulatory authorities ? and I 

 mean all of them. They have been formed to regulate sectors 

 where competition could be at stake, where development of 

 markets has to happen and where service delivery has to 

 be improved upon. Almost all of these sectors have one or 

 two government enterprises. And retired government officials, 

 who have more often than not worked in these very same enterprises, 

 are the heads of these authorities.

 I cannot imagine that the finance 

 minister had no say in deciding on some of these positions, 

 or does not realize the importance of keeping them free 

 of government influence. Thus, simply saying that all programmes 

 will be monitored is not good enough. I would like to know 

 how. The fact that this has not been spelt out makes me 

 very suspicious.

 But the finance minister is an 

 honest man who believes, and quite rightly, that with proper 

 education and health, most people can take care of themselves 

 if they are not at war. Overall, the budget appears to be 

 a statement of this belief, to which I subscribe.

 NIGHT WATCH

 Ordinary citizens may not find the police at their side when they are in danger in the middle of the night. That may be because they are busy elsewhere, out in their armed gangs beating up fasting students and their friends on a university campus, and, allegedly, again behind closed doors in a hospital. Nowadays that is their job, it seems, the decision having descended right from the centre of power in the state. What happened on the premises of Jadavpur University at the unearthly hour of 1.30 am on Saturday morning needs to be marked out as a kind of new history. The students fasting there in protest against the university authorities? decision to suspend them were first warned, then beaten up by policemen. The men in uniform were democratic and gender-neutral in their violence ? they beat up boys and girls, those weak with fasting as well as their friends. This is the outcome of a long tussle between the students and the university authorities, originating in an incident in 2003, when the boys had been involved in a violent agitation. There is no question of condoning violence, and it is up to the university administration to take disciplinary action. But, however serious, it is exactly that, a question of discipline. And in a question of discipline, the university must take the same action in every case, as fitting. The ensuing problems must be worked out within the university.

 The questions raised by the incident cannot be avoided. How can the request of university authorities, who call the police to beat up their own students when they are fasting, be taken seriously? It can only be a very inefficient, unfit and infirm university authority that can make such a request. Would it be too fanciful to conclude that, even in the leading educational institutions in the state, political equations have obscured the serious issues raised by breaches of discipline? Then again, why choose the middle of the night? Reportedly, the decision was taken in the Writers? Buildings hours before that. The baton-happy policemen claimed that they were acting under orders. Had they been ordered to drag the already injured students to hospital and beat them up again?And what was the Rapid Action Force doing on the campus? It would be useful if the chief minister, being police minister too, were to state clearly whether he approves of what his men did. In a city where people are forbidden to take umbrellas into parks so they do not turn immoral, and the police beat up students at night most morally, the chief minister?s comment will help citizens define the kind of state they are living in.

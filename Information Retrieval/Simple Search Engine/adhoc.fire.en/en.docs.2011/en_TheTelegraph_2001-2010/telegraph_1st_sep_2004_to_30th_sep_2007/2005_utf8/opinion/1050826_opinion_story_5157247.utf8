 WITH THE RIGHT MOTIVES

 In the name of dhamma

 Mauryan India: A People?s History of India 4 Edited 

 by Irfan Habib and Vivekanand Jha, 

 Tulika, Rs 350

 With their obsession with ?scientific history?, the burden of ?evidence? and unrelenting anti-communalism, the Aligarh historians are now a vulnerable lot. Yet for those negotiating ancient India, it would be unwise to dismiss the precision they bring into the ?reading? of this history. This slim volume (and slimness in history-writing is definitely in) which, the editors tell us, has jumped the queue and has preceded the well-intentioned volume on the Buddha, covers the period (350 BC to about 185 BC) from Alexander?s invasion of India till the end of the Mauryan empire. 

 There are three exhaustive chapters in this book ? the first on the Greek invasion and the fledgling Mauryan empire, the second devoted, almost entirely, to Asoka, and the third and crucial ?economy, society and culture? of the period. The divisions, as also the subdivisions, would be found to be common occurrences in all history textbooks, and this is where the spring of action lies. 

 The series was planned, as Irfan Habib tells us, to provide a ?textbook level book? for senior college students and teachers and the lay man. The ?People?s History?, apart from trying to bring into the picture the excluded social segments and looking at historical change through their eyes, thus also plans to have a hand in the making of the ?people? ? the people of India ? unmotivated by ?communal and chauvinistic interpretations? of history. One would hope this aim to produce an ?unmotivated? history does not function as a motive itself in the subsequent volumes. As for this volume, the editors manage to steer a middle path, save in the discussion of Asoka?s dhamma, which though excellent, does betray a more contemporary fear (?The absence of any political demands in the name of dhamma is yet another surprising element of the Ashokan exhortations.?). 

 The evidence here is exhaustive, the narrative updated in the light of new researches, the science of epigraphy explained in detail. Very few textbooks can be trusted with such extensive discussions of Mauryan administration, the socio-economic conditions and culture in relation to the primary sources, the Aramaic and Greek inscriptions, as also the Asokan inscriptions, rock and pillar edicts. 

 Utmost care is taken not to weigh down the history by the references. Instead of interrupting the narrative, discussions on subjects the editors think important are taken up at the end of the chapters. This is where we find notes on Arthashastra, Mauryan chronology, the dialects on the Asokan pillars and so on. What makes this period stand out is the introduction of writing, an ?epochal advance in any society?, in the administration of the state. 

 In true textbook style, this volume follows a linear path of history ? the conquests, the rise and fall of empires, the larger-than-life rulers. And yet below these upheavals is the unbroken rhythm of life ? the life of the ?people? of the Mauryan period who are at times in conflict with the state (as the forest-dwellers or atavis are, debarred from hunting by Asoka), and sometimes willing servants ? dhamma mahatmas, taking the king?s religion beyond the boundaries. There are castes and subcastes, each contributing in their own ways to the progression of history. 

 As a textbook, Mauryan India is remarkable because of its thoroughness. Like textbooks, it points to other works that might be referred to in its short bibliographies. And, like other textbooks, it speaks in an authoritative voice, offering no window through which one can look into other histories of the same people.

 PROMISES TO KEEP

 Malvika Singh

 One more anniversary of independence and India will be ripe and ready for another ?invasion?, this time, inshallah, by a fresh, new political force that is structured on humane ethics and values rather than on exploitative, selfish parameters. Every political party has failed this country and its plurality. Every political party is knotted up with infighting, beset with a complete lack of creative thinking, doing things and accumulating for itself alone. Brazen, speaking untruths, protecting the wrong, demeaning the right and much more ? these collectives have betrayed Bharat and India. They have played the two against each other, forcing a polarization on the lines of rich and poor. They have aggravated the problems that face a changing society.

 Indians, however, have moved on, despite the leadership and in spite of the stranglehold of government. The all- pervasive and overpowering nature of ?governance?, if one can call it that, has, by its very nature and modus operandi, established and endorsed the frightful sway of corruption, has destroyed gracious and appropriate conduct, has compelled the citizenry to break all norms of integrity to survive in the cesspool that the rulers have created. Hypocrisy has become the symbol of leadership. What a dreadful dilution of the many ideals that swept this subcontinent in the Fifties. What a betrayal of faith. What domination of greed. And, those who lead in the political and public space are not ashamed. That is the tragedy of India.

 Ordinary people have saved this country from breaking up. Resilience is the strongest character trait of Indians. It has been the defining link of this polity. It has kept India intellectually free. It has kept India united.

 Sincere pledge

 Over the last decade, more so than at any other time, our parliamentarians have indulged in the most unacceptable of practices, breaking every norm of decent functioning. They have made a mockery of dissension and debate, two essential pillars of a democracy. The credibility of India has been undermined as a result. 

 Their mirror image is reflected on the streets of India. The rape of the dignity of the house and the physical rape on the streets. Sonia Gandhi, Manmohan Singh, Somnath Chatterjee and A.B. Vajpayee are amongst the few senior and responsible members who should pledge to restore sane deliberations and dignity in both houses of parliament. It was a relief to hear the prime minister speak in parliament on the Nanavati report. After years, there was a semblance of order and appropriateness that was in keeping with the sanctity of the house. Even the opposition was silenced?finally.

 The uncivilized behaviour of those who rule us, who are the face of India for the world, have let us down. It is the nameless people who have put us on the map. In India, their entrepreneurial sense has overcome the boulders deliberately placed in their path. They have absorbed indignities and risen above the grim realities that pervade this land. Inner strengths have given them succour and helped them survive the many assaults. Abroad, our citizens have integrated with and respected other cultures. They have worked with integrity. They have achieved overseas what they could never achieve in their motherland because India has suffocated creativity and enterprise with endless restrictive norms.

 The prime minister should pledge to change the tenor, the horrible attitude of the ?authority? ? be they politicians, administrators, police or whatever ? towards citizens. Anyone who lives on government dole is living on the dole provided by the people of India. They are accountable to the people first, and not to their political bosses. The political bosses are accountable to the people of India as well. They have all betrayed India. Pledge to change.

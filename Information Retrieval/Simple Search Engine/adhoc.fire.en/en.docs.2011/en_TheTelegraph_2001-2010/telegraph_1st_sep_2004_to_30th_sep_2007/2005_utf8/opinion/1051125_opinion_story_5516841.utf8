 STRAIGHT OUT OF BIHAR

 MALVIKA SINGH

 Finally, Lalu Prasad is no longer the supremo of Bihar. The former chief minister is a great communicator, has a certain kind of charisma and a turn of phrase that goes across the footlights with ease, but has, over the years, made a complete mockery of governance, administration, integrity and law and order. What was once Pataliputra, a state that embodied the best of our civilization, has been reduced to a state plagued by terror, horror, malfunction and corruption. This is not what the people of Bihar deserve. Number-crunching, alliances, et al were of no consequence this time. It was clear that Lalu Prasad was out. This has been a definitive vote against the RJD, for Nitish Kumar, not the BJP nor the NDA. With Nitish Kumar at the helm, let us hope that the rotten plight of a good, patient and innocent people will cease and a dignity of living will be restored. 

 Those politicians in the UPA who are trying to find all manner of explanations for this verdict should stop wasting their time and energy. Instead, they should get on with making sure that they are not defeated in all the other states that will go to the hustings over the next few years. Indians have a special facility for patience and resilience but when bad practices cross that fine line and pierce the balance, they hurl the muck out and will now make the government and the bureaucracy accountable. It is sad that those who administer India cannot see the reality. Their arrogance will soon drown them. The writing is clear and spelt out on the wall. Our manthan has begun ? an indigenous revolution ? la Bharat. 

 Hope in the air

 Laluji will now have to fall in line and correct his stance which verged on blackmail much like that of the left parties, dangling the support numbers like spoilt brats whenever they want to have their way. The many creditable initiatives of the UPA have been undermined and often diluted by those within the coalition and outside it. Lalu Prasad has the tacit support of the left despite the many charges of corruption against him. The hypocrisy revealed by such parties is fast becoming unacceptable. To see an exceptional civilization being reduced to this abysmal level by a bunch of ?leaders? is tragic. 

 Sonia Gandhi spoke recently about civil society. If the Congress-led coalition could make the return to civil society their one-point agenda in every ministry, in every sphere of economic and social activity, where any Congressman and bureaucrat breaking the code of conduct would be suspended or dismissed, this nation would salute and follow that leadership. An administrative and political cleansing is an immediate ?must do?. 

 Parliamentarians should be taught manners, given lessons in ethics, and compelled to function by a set of dignified and humane values. In our democracy, they must be as vulnerable or secure as the citizens they represent. They should be stripped of their perks and trappings. A return to Gandhi and Nehru, to their morality, integrity, intellect, commitment and ethics would be one way to start the process of change, particularly in urban, consumerist India, where confusion and anarchy rule. 

 For some unexplained reason, there seems to be a sense of hope in the air. Some of the utterances by influential leaders are in a new language, representing the thinking and aspiration of ordinary people. The only hope is that this is not a mere mirage, and that it is here to stay and grow. A new, vibrant energy is evident except in the realm of babudom. Their wretched airports stink of urine, the state carrier has a toilet that can only spread disease, municipal roads are potholed, electricity is erratic, water is polluted, and so is the air. The leaders have to make the bureaucracy accountable to deliver the goods and get out of the hair of India.

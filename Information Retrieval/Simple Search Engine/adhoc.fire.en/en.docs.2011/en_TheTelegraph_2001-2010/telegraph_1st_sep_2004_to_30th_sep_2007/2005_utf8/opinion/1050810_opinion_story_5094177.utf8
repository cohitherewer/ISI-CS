 LATE REPORT

 Justice delayed is justice denied. The report of the Nanavati commission on the 1984 Sikh riots in Delhi that was tabled in parliament on Monday has lost its relevance and its poignancy because of the time which has elapsed between the report and the events it investigated. The inordinately long time taken to prepare the report takes the edge away from some of its findings. It has taken 21 years and nine enquiries to furnish an official version of the 1984 pogrom against the Sikhs. The person who was home minister when the killings took place ? P.V. Narasimha Rao ? is dead. So is the person who was the prime minister at the time: Rajiv Gandhi. Most ? if not all ? of the senior police officials who were in charge of law and order in Delhi in November 1984 have all retired or are dead. Thus the report makes a mockery of the idea of official accountability. It makes the statement that there was ?a colossal failure of maintenance of law and order? and that the attitude of the police force ?was callous?. But such words of condemnation have very little meaning after two decades. There is no explanation for the time taken to prepare the report, which will serve no purpose except being preserved in the archives for some historian to read and analyse. It is important not to hold any individual responsible for the delay and the procrastination. The delay is systemic, part of any official enquiry.

 Even those who could be booked by the evidence available before the commission have been allowed to get away because of the report?s wording. It says that it found ?credible evidence? against Mr Jagdish Tytler and Mr Sajjan Kumar for instigating mob violence against the Sikhs. This has been interpreted by the government as uncertain evidence. ?Credible evidence? is not taken to mean firm and incontrovertible evidence. Yet at least two individuals testified before the commission that they had seen Mr Tytler and Mr Kumar leading mobs. But such testimonies are not enough, according to the government, to take action against the two political leaders. Obviously, the Congress and the government it leads do not believe that a Congress leader should be above even the suspicion of having blood on his hands.

 The Congress is obviously uncomfortable with the commission?s report. As the champion of secularism, the Congress will need more than whitewash to obliterate the fact that the massacre of the Sikhs in Delhi took place under its aegis. Even the presence of a Sikh prime minister cannot take away from the discomfort. The Bharatiya Janata Party, with the Gujarat pogrom behind it, cannot afford to be vocal in condemning the Nanavati commission report, and the absence of action in its aftermath. The left is also somewhat subdued for tactical reasons. Political parties, as is their wont, have put politics before principles. The killing of thousands of innocent Sikhs has become a victim of collective amnesia.

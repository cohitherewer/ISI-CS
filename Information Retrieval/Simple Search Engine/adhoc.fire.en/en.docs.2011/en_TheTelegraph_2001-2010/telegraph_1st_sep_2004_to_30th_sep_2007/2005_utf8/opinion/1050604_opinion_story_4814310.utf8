 Letters to Editor

 Hardly the way to show respect

 Sir ? Soon after Sunil Dutt?s death on May 25, all the news channels started beaming shots of his body, and celebrities coming to pay their last respects. Till his cremation in the evening, Sunil Dutt?s body dominated our television screens. However, many of these channels were insensitive enough to show in between an undergarment commercial featuring Dutt?s son, Sunjay. Without going into the question of obscenity, it must be said that the channels could have shown some respect to Dutt by refraining from using the commercial ? at least during that day. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Girl power

 Sir ? The news report, ?Group of girls takes life back in hand from husbands? (May 28), was intriguing. The mass divorce that a group of teenaged girls in Nadia?s Nakashipara village obtained from their husbands appear to have been glorified. Social activists and sociologists reportedly lauded the act and the large-scale recovery of dowry. The report states that unmarried girls have been inspired to tread the same path. 

 There is, perhaps, another perspective. Divorce strikes at the institution of marriage, and once divorce becomes a social institution itself, the foundations of marriage will crumble. A number of issues of the Nakashipara incident need to be examined. The 20 girls, aged between 16 and 19, who went for divorce were all minors at the time of their marriage. Perhaps the circle inspector, who so kindly facilitated their divorce, ought to have tried to prevent child marriages within his jurisdiction. Perhaps the social scientists and activists who talk about the role of literacy and empowerment could have done something towards the abolition of the dowry system. Perhaps the guardians of the minor girls ought to have thought some more before rushing their daughters into marriage. Will the same people who facilitated and lauded the mass divorce, be by the side of the girls when they try to relocate themselves in society after divorce? Could they not have played a more positive role in protecting the institution of marriage through counselling or administrative measures within their powers? 

 Yours faithfully,

S.K. Chanda, Calcutta

 Sir ? The story of the 20 teenaged girls braving the wrath of their husbands and the displeasure of society clearly shows that even today, Indian society is largely patriarchal. Notwithstanding a few changes that have come in the lives of Indian women over the years, the attitude of our society towards women remains the same: Men will enjoy the pleasures of the outside world while women faithfully carry out the household chores. But, finally, in a few corners, women are coming out of the domestic confines and asserting their rights. It is unfortunate, though, that a good number of Indian men still cling to practices which ought to have died in the Middle Ages. It is time that men realized that man and woman do not live by competition but by co-operation. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? It is heartening for senior citizens like us that at least twenty teenaged girls of Nadia?s Nakashipara village could garner enough courage to rebel ?against the torture and humiliation at the hands of their husbands? and obtain divorce. The circle inspector, A. Rashidujjaman, deserves praise for the way he has handled the complications of the individual cases.The girls themselves have acted in a mature and pragmatic manner by avoiding legal actions ? which are generally lengthy and frustrating ? and restricting their demands to the return of their dowry. With determination, even insurmountable problems can be overcome.

 Yours faithfully,

 Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

 OILS NOT WELL

 K. Natwar Singh may have had his share of troubles but never before has he found himself on such slippery terrain

 Unlike Aesops Fables, political humour comes with conflicting taglines. So the story on Kunwar Natwar Singh and Mani Shankar Aiyar ? now in the annals of contemporary history ? has a message that can be interpreted differently. Some years ago, Aiyar spotted an entry in the visitors book of his old college, St Stephens. The lines had been scribbled by another old boy. I am what I am today because of St Stephens, Natwar Singh had written. Aiyar scrawled below that: Why blame the college? 

 Some would read the tale as yet another example of Aiyars irrepressible and often irreverent wit. Some would look at it as a comment on the seriousness with which Singh viewed himself. But Aiyar himself has another take on the subject. The incident ? and no, its not apocryphal ? marks Natwar Singhs sense of humour, he says. Its to his credit that he laughed it off. 

 Singh wouldnt be laughing much these days, though. Late last week, Indias external affairs minister and his Congress party were named non-contractual beneficiaries of Iraqi oil sales in 2001 under a United Nations Oil-for-Food Programme. Singh described the allegations as baseless. I have had nothing to do with this affair, he told the press. 

 But the incident continues to hit the headlines. The Congress is in a huddle, wondering what to do. The Left parties are upping the ante. And the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is gloating. This is turning ideology into an office of profit, says BJP spokesperson Arun Jaitley. 

 The incident threatens to mar the image and career of Natwar Singh. There is some speculation in political circles that he may lose his portfolio. Singh is close to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, which may allow the Mayo College (Bharatpur house) old boy to live to see another day. But he also has his share of detractors in the Congress, and insiders refer to a growing rift between the Prime Ministers Office and the ministry of external affairs. 

 The 74-year-old Congressman, once a career diplomat, sees himself as an old party hand. So at Cabinet meetings he would not restrict his views to foreign affairs, but often hold forth ? much to the discomfort of the Prime Minister ? on government policy. For the time-being, though, the Congress appears to have decided to stand by him. I have for him the highest regard, says Aiyar. Adds old friend, former foreign secretary Maharaj Krishna Rasgotra, I just cannot believe all this of Natwar. 

 In many ways, Singh belongs to the old school of the Congress ? the one that believes the Non-Aligned Movement is still alive and kicking. He is also a Congressman at heart ? even though he strayed to the Tiwari Congress, and faced an electoral rout, in the mid-Nineties. 

 Singh is a Congressman in yet another way. His son, Jagat Singh, is often in the eye of a storm. A Congress legislator from Rajasthan, Jagats recent Iraq trips are being viewed with some suspicion in political circles. 

 The ministers family life has been particularly troubling. Daughter Ritu committed suicide in May 2002, just two months after his daughter-in-law, Natasha, the estranged wife of Jagat Singh, was found dead in a Delhi hotel. 

 Yet when it comes to pedigree, Singh is right at the top in the party. He is related to the Bharatpur royals, and his wife, Punjab chief minister Amrinder Singhs sister, is the daughter of the former Maharajah of Patiala. Legend has it that ex-UP governor Romesh Bhandari was once introducing his wife ? Amrinders half-sister ? to an august gathering. Meet my wife, the daughter of the Maharajah of Patiala, he said. Natwar Singh was next in line. Meet my wife, he said. The daughter of the Maharajah and the Maharani of Patiala. 

 But Singh, despite the pride that he takes in his wifes genealogy, has always been caught between conflicting worlds: he is not a true-blue royal, he is not a pure diplomat and he is not quite a politician. And the Cambridge man, a friend of E.M. Forster, is a Jat. Sometimes, when he suddenly says something indiscreet, we know that the Jat in him has broken out, says a party watcher. 

 That could explain Singhs comments after he took over as the foreign minister last year. Singh first warmly embraced Islamabad ? shocking the hawks. And then he announced that India would go back to the 1972 Simla accord with Pakistan when both countries thought they had moved considerably ahead since then. Though he went on to improve ties with Pakistan, Singh, one of the architects of Indias disastrous intervention in Sri Lanka in the Eighties, is yet to leave a mark on the policy front. In September, Singh led India to back a resolution for Iran to be referred to the UN Security Council over its nuclear plans. The move kicked up a furore back home, but the external affairs ministry claimed that India had actually helped safeguard Irans legitimate interests. 

 For Singh, leaving the foreign office would chronicle the end of an era. He didnt leave a mark behind, but many think he didnt leave a blot either. And, characteristically, as the Iran vote demonstrates, he sought to straddle two worlds. Not surprisingly, he was at his testy best when asked if he saw himself as a hawk or a dove. I am not running a menagerie, he famously remarked.

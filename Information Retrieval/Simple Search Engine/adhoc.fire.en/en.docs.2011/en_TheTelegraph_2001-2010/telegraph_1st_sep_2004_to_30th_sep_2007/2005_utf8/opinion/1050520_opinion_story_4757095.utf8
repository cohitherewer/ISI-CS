 THE MORE THINGS CHANGE

 The full picture

 Mantras of change: Reporting India in a time of flux, 

 By Daniel Lak, 

 Penguin, Rs 375 

 In the early Nineties, several Indian newspapers carried a report about an unusual politician. Bhagawan Das was a ?tea boy? in a canteen at the Durgapur steel plant in West Bengal before he became a Communist Party of India (Marxist) member of the Lok Sabha. At the end of his five-year term as a parliamentarian, he returned to his old job in the canteen. It was an almost unbelievable story in a country where even a brief spell in any position of power means an opportunity to make money, mostly by corrupt means. But there was another side to the story ? of an unchanging India where individual enterprise and ambition are not exactly great virtues for ordinary people. 

 Daniel Lak tells us the story of another tea boy who becomes a millionaire. And thereby hangs his tale of the new India that he saw emerge during his stint as the BBC correspondent in New Delhi in the late Nineties. Lak meets his tea boy in the office of the Infosys founder, N.R. Narayana Murthy, in Bangalore. Even as he continues to serve tea in the office, he buys and sells shares of the software technology company that has come to be one of the icons of a changing India and goes on to become a millionaire. 

 It was never easy for foreigners, whether journalists or specialists, to make sense of the baffling complexities of an ancient country and its odd mixtures of modernity and tradition. The difficulty often resulted in stereotypes of a country either of bullock carts, snake charmers and satis, or of maharajas and spiritual gurus.

 Lak came to work in New Delhi at a time when a very different India was emerging, thanks to the economic reforms introduced in 1991. The book takes us to people like Narayana Murthy, N. Chandrababu Naidu and Pradeep Kar of the Microland group, who are the new icons of a changing India, and to places like Bangalore, Mumbai and Hyderabad, where the changes are happening at their best and fastest. It is all done in accordance with the time-tested craft of story-telling, with practically no theorizing or value-judgment spoiling the narrative but plenty of witticisms to enliven it.

 He is equally at ease portraying the other India where nothing seems to be changing and where centuries of social backwardness block all roads to change. A conversation with Ashish Bose, India?s best-known demographer, on the Bimaru states, thus offers interesting, if also disturbing, insights into the vast hinterlands that come in the way of the country?s brave new steps into modernity. In other chapters, the reader is taken on a journey through some of these backwaters. The problem, as many have noted, lies with the old India ? the inefficient and insensitive bureaucrats, corrupt politicians and overall statism that was the hallmark of the pre-reforms era. 

 It is not just the economy, though, that is changing. The effects of liberalization are showing on the family and other social structures, which have long remained patriarchal and otherwise tradition-bound. Deepa Mehta?s film, Fire, inspires Lak to look into the changing attitudes to sexual relationships. 

 So what does the future hold for India? Lak is optimistic about the future of the Indian economy but is also worried about the deep social and economic inequities, of the threats from the spread of HIV/AIDS and the unending tension with Pakistan over Kashmir. Lak?s is a reality check that is both instructive and entertaining.

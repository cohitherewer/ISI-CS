 STUMP CARE

 - Abjection and doggedness

 Cosm? Tura, Piet?

 Slow Man 

 By J.M. Coetzee, Secker amp; Warburg, ? 11

 Slow Man is a difficult meditation on coldness by perhaps the coldest and most comfortless of contemporary writers. It is also a study of geriatric abjection and doggedness. And in this, it repeatedly harks back to the Old Masters, who were never wrong about suffering ? to Lear, Timon and Job, to Gregor Samsa and Ivan Ilyich, and to Yeats?s bitter, beautiful poems about old age. ?You poor, cold man,? Elizabeth Costello tells Paul Rayment, as she feeds the ducks by the Sidney riverside. Elizabeth is a celebrated Australian novelist ? well into her sixties, weak of heart and offspring-forsaken ? who was the incorrigible, eponymous heroine of Coetzee?s previous novel. She barges into the life of Rayment (the hero of Slow Man), and refuses to go away, for she wants to ?find out what happens when a man of sixty engages his heart unsuitably?.

 Her cruel reduction of the story of Paul?s complicated life ? leaving nothing but the bleached bones ? is emblematic of how the entire novel deals with Paul, a childless divorc?. It is also true of how Paul deals with himself, and of how Elizabeth attempts to work him out. Slow Man begins with Paul on his bicycle being hit by a car: ?he hears rather than feels the impact of his skull on the bitumen, distant, wooden, like a mallet-blow?. His mangled right leg is amputated, and he is released into ?frail care? at home. ?Thesis, antithesis, then prosthesis,? Paul deliberates ? as Timon, or Titus among those lopped Roman limbs, would have done. Being a purist and a Stoic, he decides against the prosthesis. The Australian welfare system assigns him a nurse for his ?stump care? ? a thickening, Croatian immigrant, but with a ?burstingness of fruit at its ripest?. And with Marijana Jokic, the unsuitable engagement of Paul?s heart begins and progresses inexorably through the novel. His admiration of her masterful nursing rapidly turns into sexual love, and then to abjection.

 Faced with Marijana?s professional intransigence, Paul realizes that the ?human intangibles? he offers her ? love, for instance ? will not work. So he turns to harder currency, and fixes on Marijana?s angelic teenage son, Drago, proposing to fund his education in an expensive school. Her response is ambiguous, opaque. As Paul?s abasement deepens, every member of her family is preyed on hungrily ? the daughters, the husband. Drago moves into Paul?s home as a ruinous lodger, but with his own odd, unpredictable humane reflexes. The growing complication of Paul?s involvement with the Jokics parallels, not without its own grim comedy, the welling up in him of the ?will to give?: ?Giving always bucks him up...Spurs him to give more. Like gambling. The thrill all in the losing. Loss upon loss. The reckless, heedless falling.?

 This relentless anatomy of the ethics of ?giving? leads not only to the cold man?s ?dark heart?, but also to the moral core of Coetzee?s ?novel of ideas?. The ethics of ?giving? is inseparable from that of receiving, for we expect, or demand, to ?receive but what we give?. What Marijana mimics as Paul?s ?I want, I want, I want? is the obverse of his quest for ?mystical parenthood?: ?Over the whole brood he wants to extend the shield of his benevolent protection.? The proffering of largesse becomes inextricable from the need for ?sexual charity?, caritas from eros. Paul?s folly, as both Elizabeth and Marijana make him see, is to breach the delicate code of the ?impersonal personal?, to bring to ?good nursing? the demands of ?loving care?. Thus, if Elizabeth Costello was about ?the question of cruelty?, then Slow Man is about the question of ?care?. Together, they leave one with the sense that, at some fundamental level, the two are essentially the same question. Both go to the root of what it means to be human and inhuman, to suffer and to make others suffer, to want to love and be loved, to pity and be pitied, to care and not to care. They invent, in order to experiment with and reflect on, ?zones of humiliation? in which human minds and bodies play out their irredeemably unequal relationships with other minds and bodies, human as well as animal and divine. 

 In Slow Man, the question of care ? ?So who is going to take care of you?? ? rises up from a muddle of ?interrogatives? in Paul as he slowly gains consciousness after his accident: ?What is this that is being done to me? or What is this place where I find myself? or even What is this fate that has befallen me?? So, the unexpected arrival of Elizabeth Costello in Chapter 13 seems designed to provide an unsettling set of answers to these questions. She begins by reciting to Paul the opening of Coetzee?s novel (the description of Paul?s accident), and it is soon clear that she intuitively senses his thoughts, and has knowledge of what he remembers and desires. ?You came to me,? she tells him, ?a man with a bad leg and no future and an unsuitable passion?Where we go from there I have no idea.?

 As this other story of dependence punctuated with violent resentment unfolds alongside the story of Paul and the Jokics, a sense of unreality begins to take over, first, Paul?s self-consciousness and then, the entire novel. Are we actually reading Paul?s writing or Elizabeth?s? And this readerly confusion ? not unlike the bewilderment produced by Vel?zquez?s Las Meninas ? becomes, in Paul, a sense of having been killed into writing. Perhaps he didn?t survive the accident at all, but just passed into ?a second world identical with the first, where time resumes and the action proceeds?: ?Is this what it is like to be translated to what at present he can only call the other side?? Two accidents seem to have befallen him ? to be hit by a car and be crippled, and his election into writing. And the second comes to him as a greater humiliation, a greater loss of self, what he calls his ?Copernican moment?. Elizabeth Costello is about the ethical complexity of being a writer; Slow Man about the surreal complicatedness of being written. Paul senses, while reading Elizabeth?s scribblings for his ?life? as she sleeps, some sort of a connection between them in a darkly shared need: ?somehow, in ways so obscure, so labyrinthine that the mind baulks at exploring them, the need to be loved and the storytelling, that is to say the mess of papers on the table, are connected.?

 It is for Elizabeth?s ?need to be loved? ? to be let in and cared for ? that Coetzee reserves his last coldness, the terrible light of its final truth-telling. Having come to the farthest limits of their shared fiction, Elizabeth presents to Paul, as Lear does to Cordelia, a vision of their life together: ?You could teach me doggedness and I could teach you to live on nothing, or nearly nothing. Is this love, Paul? Have we found love at last?? Paul puts on his glasses and takes a good look at her: ?In the clear late-afternoon light he can see every detail, every hair, every vein. He examines her, then examines his heart. ?No,? he says at last, ?this is not love. This is something else. Something less.?? The hardness of the real, of truth itself, is the final intransigence that the human mind might baulk at, but art at its cruellest, or kindest, might just about manage to hold.

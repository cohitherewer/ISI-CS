 LARGER FAILURE

 The bloodshed in Cooch Behar must have come as a severe blow to Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s government. Tragic as the incident is, it is not the casualties that would be the most unsettling thing for the chief minister. Of far greater import are the administrative and political failures to prevent the tragedy. It is not as though the violence was a flash in the pan. The Greater Cooch Behar People?s Association had announced its agitation plan well in advance. It is safe to assume that the government had information on the nature of the movement. Yet, the incident showed how pathetically unprepared the government had been to handle the situation. Also, for all its claim of an effective organizational network, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) failed to gauge the movement?s rising popularity. The first thing that Mr Bhattacharjee needs to do, therefore, is face these failures. Having done that, he must find out what led to the colossal failure of the government?s intelligence agencies. And he must immediately set about cleaning up their act. For such failures could be dangerous for peace and stability in other parts of Bengal, especially those vulnerable to Maoist violence. 

 His other important task, of course, is to sincerely assess why the flare-up in Cooch Behar happened. But a mutual blame game, like the one between the CPI(M) and its ally, the Forward Bloc, is not the way. Even the opposition parties ? the Congress and the Trinamool Congress ? have merely seen in the tragedy another opportunity to bait the CPI(M). Predictably, most political parties attribute the popularity of the movement to the lack of economic development in north Bengal. This explanation is valid only partially. Even the movement?s leaders would dismiss this as a simplistic understanding of it. They see the demand for a separate state as an expression of their social and political aspirations. This had been the case for all popular movements for statehood, be in Darjeeling, Jharkhand or in Uttaranchal. In north Bengal, another movement ? for a ?Kamtapur state? ? has been periodically active for nearly three decades. The important question is why such large sections of the people feel alienated from the mainstream and want to go their separate ways. This seems to be the larger failure, and the responsibility for it must lie with all major political parties in varying degrees.

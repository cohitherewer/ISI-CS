 ILL MET FOR TEA 

 The phrase playing cricket has come to acquire a meaning and resonance that goes far beyond the playing arena. It has come to stand for propriety and correct behaviour. In this sense, it can be said without mincing words that Mr Sharad Pawar, the president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, did not play cricket when he had a meeting with Sourav Ganguly on Tuesday. The decision to drop Ganguly from the Indian test team has created some amount of controversy which some politicians have helped to stir up. But this cannot be the ground for a meeting between Ganguly and the president of the BCCI. So far the latter is concerned, Ganguly is just another player who has been discarded by the selection committee. He cannot be singled out for any kind of special treatment. Or is Mr Pawar going to make a practice of having a cup of tea with every player who loses his place in the side? If the argument is that Mr Pawar met Ganguly because the latter is a former captain, then it must be pointed out ? and this cannot be unknown to Mr Pawar ? that Ganguly is not the first captain to lose his position and place in the side. When Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi was summarily dismissed from the captaincy by the casting vote of Vijay Merchant in 1971, the then board president did not invite Pataudi for tea, biscuits and sympathy.

 Mr Pawar has set a very bad precedent. He has opened up the possibility of regional pressures being mounted upon him and on the selection committee whenever a player is dropped from the side. By meting out special treatment to Ganguly, Mr Pawar has put forward the obnoxious principle that all players are equal, but some players are more equal than others. The impropriety on Mr Pawar?s part has another aspect. It puts the selection committee under a kind of shadow. While what transpired between Mr Pawar and Ganguly is not known, the very fact that the meeting took place suggests that Mr Pawar is not averse to the idea of peering over the shoulders of the selection committee. Mr Pawar has failed to come out with a clear statement that decisions made by the selection committee are not negotiable. Mr Pawar is the head of the BCCI not because he has a long association with cricket. He owes his BCCI appointment to his position as a politician. Despite this, he must ensure that political compulsions do not taint cricketing decisions. He is sailing too close to the fatal wind of politics.

The man in the shadow 

If Sourav Gangulys exclusion can create so much 

furore, why not Zaheer Khans?

It?s a pity that the Gujaratis of Vadodara are not 

as passionate as the Bengalis. They have not burnt effigies of Greg Chappell and 

Kiran More, not even registered their protest against the raw deal handed out 

to the medium pacer, Zaheer Khan. Or maybe they are content with the presence 

of Irfan Pathan in the national team. Unlike Bengal, Baroda at least has another 

star performer representing it in the international arena. 

One wishes Narendra Modi were a little like Buddhadeb 

Bhattacharjee. Their obviously divergent political leanings apart, it is difficult 

to imagine Modi frothing at the mouth over the exclusion of a deserving Gujarat 

boy from the national cricket team. Yes, conspiracy theorists would always say 

that he might, for a Hindu boy, but taking up cudgels for a Muslim young man? 

Never. It doesn?t help matters that the man in question, Zaheer Khan, is originally 

from Maharashtra, not among Modi?s favourite states. 

The honourable, secular communist speaker of the Lok 

Sabha, while waxing eloquent about the injustice done to Ganguly, forgot to mention 

the other cricketer felled by a similar act of injustice. 

And when it comes to administrators, the Baroda Cricket 

Association chief, Chirayu Amin, is no Jagmohan Dalmia, who can shoot off angry 

letters and pull strings to expedite a player?s return to the team. It is understandable 

that Kiran More, also from Vadodara, should refuse to plead for Zaheer Khan when 

he has made no attempt to soften his stand with regard to Ganguly. 

In the expected and, to an extent justified, uproar 

over Ganguly?s exclusion, Zaheer Khan?s case has been pushed to a remote corner. 

How many column inches have been devoted to asking why Khan is being kept out 

of the team, when the front pages are full of Ganguly? The left arm pacer had 

taken four wickets in the last test match innings in which he bowled. He has claimed 

23 wickets in three Duleep Trophy ties to spearhead the West Zone victory. In 

fact, he claimed Ganguly?s wicket twice in the final for the latter?s scores of 

10 and duck. He is also known to have recovered from all earlier niggles and is 

fit and bowling at a brisk pace. He has 100-odd test wickets in his kitty, and 

if his average, in the mid-30s, is nothing to write home about, then his frequent 

injuries are largely responsible for it. 

In the last World Cup, Zaheer Khan claimed 18 wickets, 

the highest by any Indian bowler in world cups, equalling Roger Binny?s 1983 record. 

He also has under his belt a world record score of 75 as a number 11 batsman. 

Ajit Agarkar, India?s potential all rounder and fast 

bowler, averages in the high forties with the ball in test match cricket and has 

claimed 50-odd wickets in 20-odd test matches. One really has to dig deep to remember 

Agarkar?s heroics with the ball apart from the second innings of the Adelaide 

test in December 2003, which India won. While never doubting Irfan Pathan?s talent 

with the bat and the ball, a closer scrutiny of his career statistics would reveal 

that the bulk of his wickets were procured in series against Bangladesh, Zimbabwe 

and in the tour to Pakistan. His bowling proved ineffectual against Australia 

in tests and also against Pakistan when they came to tour India. R.P. Singh, the 

other speedster in the squad, is still too much of an unknown quantity to bring 

into this discussion. 

Zaheer Khan deserves a recall on the sheer weight 

of his performance. The selectors have earlier given him a ticket to the team 

ignoring his partial fitness, so what is preventing them now when he is fully 

fit and raring to go? 

So here is a request to the passionate multitude better 

known as Indian cricket fans. Do hit the streets for Ganguly, but while you are 

at it, do raise your voice for Zaheer Khan?s inclusion as well. If the Indian 

parliament can spend its precious time discussing the unfair exclusion of a former 

captain (hardly the best face-saving measure after MPs were caught on camera taking 

bribes), then it can surely lobby for the player who scored the winning runs in 

the final of the Natwest trophy, arguably Indian cricket?s biggest moment of one-day 

glory since the 1983 World Cup. 

ARITRO GANGULY

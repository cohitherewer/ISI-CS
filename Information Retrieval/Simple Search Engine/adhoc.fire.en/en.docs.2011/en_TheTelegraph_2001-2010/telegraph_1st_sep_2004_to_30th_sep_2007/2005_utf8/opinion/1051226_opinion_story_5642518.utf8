 BETWEEN SEIZURE AND CONSUMPTION

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the World Drug Report 2005, published by the United Nations Office of Drug and Crime

 Another key indicator used to identify the evolution of the drug problem is treatment demand. This is also used by the UNODC as a proxy for the identification of the main ?problem drugs? in the various countries. 

 Unsurprisingly, the main problem drugs at the global level continue to be the opiates (notably heroin) followed by cocaine. For most of Europe and Asia opiates continued to be the main problem drug, accounting for 62 per cent of all treatment demand in 2003. In South America, drug-related treatment demand continued to be mainly linked to the abuse of cocaine....In Africa, the bulk of all treatment demand ? as in the past ? is linked to cannabis.

 There have also been some important shifts to established patterns in recent years, for example: cannabis in treatment demand in North America, Oceania, Europe, Africa and South-America has increased since the late 1990s; cocaine has declined in overall drug treatment in North America and has risen in Europe; opiates have declined in overall treatment in the Oceania region, a late consequence of Australia?s heroin shortage in 2001; and amphetamine type stimulant in treatment has increased in Asia, Europe, North America and Africa.

 Difficulties faced here are that some countries only have data available from a few clinics while others have country-wide monitoring systems in place. Simply adding up the number of people treated for the various drugs would give a strong bias in favour of the countries which have a nationwide monitoring system in place while disregarding the information provided by others. To overcome this problem, UNODC decided to calculate the proportions at the country level and, based on these results, to calculate the (unweighted) averages for the respective regions.

 Seizures...represent our most comprehensive data set on drugs, although they do suffer from one important shortcoming. Drugs rarely drop into the laps of law enforcement authorities, and large seizures are often the result of considerable detective work. Law enforcement capacity, as well as the share of that capacity dedicated to the drug issue, varies considerably between nations. As a result, drug seizures can confirm the presence of drugs in an area, but the lack of seizures does not demonstrate their absence, and it is never absolutely clear what share of drugs in circulation are being intercepted. In combination with other indicators, however, seizure data are a powerful tool for investigating trafficking flows and their trends. To understand seizure data, both the number of seizures and the volumes seized need to be taken into account.

 Between 1985 and 2003, the number of seizures increased fourfold. In the last few years, with the exception of a dip in 2002, the number of seizures seems to have plateaued at about 1.3 million cases. More than half of these were cannabis seizures, about a quarter involved opiates; amphetamines were seized in 10 per cent of the cases, and cocaine in 7 per cent.

 In the last decade, the most significant trend has been the increase in the number of seizures of ATS. In 2003, however, this trend reversed sharply, mainly as a result of the decline in ATS seizures from Thailand following a major crackdown...It is also estimated that ATS consumption dropped globally since 2000.

 In contrast, the proportion of opiates seizures rose significantly in 2003, mainly reflecting the revival of Afghan opium production and more seizures in the countries surrounding Afghanistan. The number of cannabis cases has been on the rise since the early 1990s, and its rate of growth exceeded that of other drugs in 2002-2003, in line with a growth in global consumption. Cocaine has remained relatively stable.

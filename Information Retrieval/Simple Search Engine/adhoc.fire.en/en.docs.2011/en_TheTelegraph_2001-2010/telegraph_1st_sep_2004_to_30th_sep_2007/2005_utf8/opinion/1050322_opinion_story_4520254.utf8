 Letters to Editor

 Wanted, a house for art

 Sir ? When the editorial, ?All shook up? (March 15), argued for abolishing the post of governors, it was making a very sensible point. It is indeed true that ?the logic of democracy...makes governors completely irrelevant?. There is also an ?architectural? point which may be forwarded here. The governors of Indian states live in some of the most magnificent colonial buildings of the country. If the governor?s post were to be done away with, buildings like the Raj Bhavan in Calcutta could be converted into state art galleries, or cultural centres. It is both strange and sad that Calcutta does not have an art gallery of the stature of the National Gallery of Modern Art in Delhi or the National Gallery in London ? though the Bengal school is one of the foremost schools of Indian art. The Raj Bhavan would be such a perfect place to exhibit our Abanindranath Tagores and Jamini Rays.

 Yours faithfully,

Sudeshna Guha, Calcutta

 Sweet success

 Sir ? The cricket series between India and Pakistan is being telecast by Doordarshan following the order of the court. But advertisements, and not cricket, is evidently more important to our national channel. The commercial break between overs frequently eats into the first delivery of the new over. What is more irritating is that the telecast goes into an ad break the instant a batsman is dismissed, even before the viewer has had a chance to blink. There is no option but to wait interminably for the parade of advertisements to end, so that one can watch the replay of the dismissal. But by the time the telecast resumes, the new batsman has made his way to the crease and a delivery has probably already been bowled. After hours of this torment, the viewer should not be blamed if he feels somewhat violent.

 On Sunday, viewers were deprived of sharing India?s moment of triumph at the Eden Gardens with the cricketers, since a long series of advertisements followed immediately after the last Pakistani wicket fell. When the live telecast resumed ? after the annoying commercials and that bigger irritant, ?Fourth Umpire? ? the presentation ceremony was about to begin. Would the courts please direct Doordarshan to learn the art of sports telecast? Maybe a tip or two from ESPN-Star Sports could help.

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir ? Even at 35, Anil Kumble has it in him to capture seven wickets for 63 runs on a pitch that was not exactly a spinner?s dream. He was one of the main architects of India?s victory on Sunday. Sourav Ganguly, on the other hand, has had too many poor shows in a row to pass them off as ?a lean phase?. However, his decision to declare India?s second innings without waiting for the last wicket to fall was a timely one. But India has little to feel complacent about. Pakistan is known for staging impressive comebacks.

 Yours faithfully,

R. Sekar, Angul

 Sir ? Three cheers to Team India for emerging winner in the second test match of the home series against Pakistan. India was clearly the better side of the two. The vice-captain?s scintillating knocks of 110 and 135 could not have come at a more appropriate time. The triumph was a tad marred by Steve Bucknor?s wrong decision, which ended Sachin Tendulkar?s second innings prematurely. Bangalore certainly promises a tough com- petition.

 Yours faithfully,

Sharmi Adhikary, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is clear that there is no love lost between the Indian team and the ?centurion? umpire, Steve Bucknor. After he pronounced Sachin Tendulkar out leg before wicket in the second innings, one cannot be blamed for thinking that Bucknor seems to carry a grudge against Indians. Indian batsmen have been his ?victims? a few times too many now. 

 The International Cricket Council ought to look seriously into the lapses of the umpires, especially of those who are on its ?elite panel?. Mistakes are inevitable, but if they follow a pattern, it should reflect poorly on the integrity of the umpire. Some serious thought needs to be given to involving technology in a bigger way, because with so much competition around, every mistake counts.

 Yours faithfully,

Saket Sundria, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is always a pleasure to read the comments of Sunil Gavaskar, since he is not only a cricketing legend but also an articulate and knowledgeable man. He is absolutely right when he says that ?most Indian cricket lovers have never understood the value of Rahul Dravid? (?Even Sachin is trying to bat like Dravid now?, March 21). He has long been the unsung hero of Indian cricket. But even a cursory look at Dravid?s centuries shows that he has not scored runs for himself alone, but has always kept in mind the interest of the team and also of his partners. 

 On the other hand, Sachin Tendulkar, reports suggest, was peeved about his second innings dismissal not so much because he was denied a chance to contribute to his team?s effort, but because he missed out on his 35th century. This is why for the true Indian cricket lover, Dravid will rank as a greater Indian cricketer than Tendulkar. Dravid is the best idol for the young generation. He is dedicated and disciplined, and most important, he is aware of his limitations.

 Yours faithfully,

Suradhuni Sengupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? Ramachandra Guha could not have been more prophetic. His ?Club before country? appeared on the fourth day of the Calcutta test, March 19. And within 24 hours, India?s victory over Pakistan by 195 runs was crafted by three South Zone players of the team ? Rahul Dravid, Anil Kumble, and not to forget, Dinesh Karthik. Surely this test will occupy a special place in Guha?s memory.

 Yours faithfully,

Shashanka Ghosh, Calcutta

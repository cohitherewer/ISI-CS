 A PARTY GONE SOUR

TWENTY-TWENTY / BHARAT BHUSHAN

 Some problems can?t be smiled away

 L.K. Advani seemed to enjoy his moment before the television cameras talking about the murder of democracy in Goa and charging the Jharkhand governor of being a ?supari killer? (contract killer). He even tried to provoke Manmohan Singh by describing him as an ?invisible? prime minister as if that were the most severe criticism his party could make of the United Progressive Alliance government. However, should he choose to look at the condition of the Bharatiya Janata Party, which he heads, he would find that it seems to be in a bad way too. 

 The party is not doing well electorally. There is unrest within its state units. An outsider may be forgiven for assuming that apart from Advani, the party does not want any other leader to grow ? Vajpayee is wheeled in and wheeled out depending on when the party needs to project a moderate image. As a result, the entire second-generation leadership is being completely wasted.

 The Bihar results are being celebrated by the party, but there is little to cheer about. The BJP?s vote-share has actually shrunk by four per cent although it has improved its performance by one seat over the assembly election results of 2000. It had won 36 assembly seats then and now it has 37. In the 2000 assembly elections, the number of seats where the BJP was the first or second runner-up was 86. That figure is now down to 61.

 In Haryana, the BJP has been wiped out. It had 13 seats in an 81-seat legislature in 1987. In the last assembly elections, where it was in alliance with Om Prakash Chautala?s Indian National Lok Dal, the party won seven out of a total of 90 seats. In this election, however, the BJP is down to a meagre two seats. In as many as 75 assembly constituencies in Haryana, the deposits of BJP candidates were forfeited for want of adequate votes.

 In Jharkhand, the party has just about saved face. But had Laloo Yadav?s Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Congress-Jharkhand Mukti Morcha combine not fallen out on the eve of the elections, even this face-saver may have been denied to the party. The shenanigans that the two sides in Jharkhand are going through to get their slender majorities do not augur well for political stability in the state. It does not seem likely that the assembly would be able to conduct any meaningful legislative business. The Jharkhand legislature may well go the Goa way.

 The BJP?s coalition government in Goa was oblivious that the Congress was poaching on its partners. Although there is no justification for the actions of the governor and the speaker in Goa, the fact remains that the Congress only paid the BJP back in the same coin by disqualifying a legislator to win the vote of confidence. Having itself first disqualified legislators whose loyalties were suspect, the BJP could hardly cry foul.

 This is still not the full picture of the BJP?s woes. Its problems in the states are growing. In Gujarat, dissatisfaction with the authoritarian style of the chief minister, Narendra Modi, is on the boil. First, BJP members of parliament from Gujarat wrote a letter to Advani, complaining against Modi ? some even wanted him removed. Now, dissidents are organizing meetings at the residence of Modi?s b?te noire, Keshubhai Patel, plotting his removal.

 In Madhya Pradesh, the former chief minister and the party?s mascot in the last assembly elections, Uma Bharti, wants the present chief minister, Babulal Gaur, removed. The BJP?s party-managers cheated Bharti out of her chief ministerial chair. Infuriated by this treatment, Bharti is now known to lash out uncontrollably at whoever reminds her of her mistreatment by the party. Last heard, she had roughed up a photographer and snatched his camera.

 In Karnataka, the BJP leader of the opposition in the legislative assembly, in the legislative council and a general secretary of the state unit of the party have resigned from their posts. They have told Advani that while they are committed to the party ideology, they cannot function with the BJP state president, Ananth Kumar, and his coterie. S. Bangarappa was brought in with much fanfare from the Congress into the BJP before the Lok Sabha elections. Disappointed with the BJP, he quit the party and on the rebound, joined hands with Mulayam Singh Yadav.

 The BJP criticizes the Congress president, Sonia Gandhi, for centralizing power in herself. However, Advani is also guilty on the same count. He is both the party president and the leader of the opposition in parliament. At a time when the BJP needs recharging, Advani is visible but the party is becoming invisible. He removed M. Venkaiah Naidu who ?resigned?, citing his wife?s illness. BJP wags are now saying that Naidu?s wife seems to have recovered, but the party has fallen sick.

 Despite centralizing power in his hands, Advani does not seem to have a grip on the party or its allies. His partymen and allies accused him of weak and soft leadership when they pushed for continuous disruption of parliament on the Jharkhand issue. Advani had wanted to call it a day after the first day?s adjournment. In the Rajya Sabha, the leader of the party, Jaswant Singh, was not even in the house on the second day when the party was agitating about Jharkhand developments. Vajpayee had absented himself from the Rajya Sabha because of backache.

 For a party that claims to agitate for the restoration of democratic norms, the BJP leaders are either half-hearted about it or missing from the trenches when required. Except for a demonstration against the price rise during the winter session of parliament, the party has not been able to undertake any major mass mobilization.

 As for its allies, the BJP is using them to defend corruption. The defence of George Fernandes in the Tehelka case has set a new trend. Now, allies like the Shiv Sena are being asked to prove their loyalty. The Shiv Sena Rajya Sabha MP, Sanjay Nirupam, was summarily expelled for demanding a debate on the allotment of Reliance Infocomm shares in a company close to Pramod Mahajan at a throw away price.

 The trouble with the BJP is that it does not know what it wants. If it wants to clean public life, then first its own leaders have to be clean. If it wants to be a party with a difference, then the character traits ? ?chaal, chalan aur charitra? in the language of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ? of its leaders have to be different. The BJP wants to govern India but does not know why. What would it do that others are not already doing? What does Hindutva mean in the 21st century, and can it ever be a principle of governance? How does its strategy of coalition politics dove-tail, if at all, into its long-term strategy of assuming power on its own? The BJP does not seem to be asking itself these questions.

 Only when clear objectives are set can the paths to achieve them be chosen. The BJP is today like the man asking for directions, who was told by a wise old farmer chewing on a blade of grass, ?If I were you I would not start from here.?

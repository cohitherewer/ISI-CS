 Paperback Pickings

 The cough syrup goes on forever

Girl alone (Penguin, Rs 225) by Rupa 

Gulab is a ?Shobhaa D? Selection? about a cough syrup junkie. An emotionally 

insecure intellectual snob and a faithful advocate of the ?Why me?? brigade. Arti 

believes that rock bands help to get centred better than shrinks do. And that 

large doses of D.H. Lawrence and Woody Allen (she studied Eng Lit at Calcutta 

University) dilute the emotional neediness coursing through her veins. In Bombay 

now, on her domineering mother?s orders to get a job or marry a loser hand-picked 

from the matrimonial columns, Arti?s one objective is to keep alive her unrelenting 

search for the man with whom she can happily live ever after. But Arti has the 

unique talent of always falling for the wrong man.

 Queen of dreams (Abacus, ? 5.50) by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni follows Sister of My Heart, Arranged Marriage, The Mistress of Spices and The Vine of Desire. The titles, when read together, give a fair sense of the general flavour of her writing. Beneath the ?complexities? of modern hyphenated existence, her mothers and daughters, caught between America and India, embody the allure of the Orient for readers who derive their ideas of the East from exotic recipe books and textiles. This is the story of Rakhi?s discovery of her mother?s dream journals, in the context of Rakhi?s own troubled existence in America and her idea of India. ?She?s thinking of green. Deep-forest green, gold-gray green, green tinged with the foggy silver of dawn, edged with the brittle brown of time passing.?

The wonder that was India (Picador, Rs 395) 

by A.L. Basham reprints this 1954 classic, to celebrate its fifty years 

in print. This edition comes with a foreword by Thomas R. Trautmann, a historian 

at the University of Michigan and once Basham?s student. This early history of 

India has sections on the state, society, everyday life, religion, the arts, language 

and literature. There are appendices on cosmology, astronomy, prosody, coinage 

and the gypsies, among other things.

Wild Tales from the wild (Lotus, Rs 295) 

by Saad Bin Jung, with a foreword by the nawab of Pataudi, is a 

hilarious book about one man?s life in the jungles, with this message between 

the lines: the grandeur and beauty of India?s forests need to be preserved at 

all costs.

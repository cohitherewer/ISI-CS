 TWISTS IN THE NEW-AGE FAIRYTALE

 Together again

 Brand New Friend By Mike Gayle, Hodder and Stoughton, ? 6.90

 ?Making friends with men is so hard, it might as well be impossible.? This wistful observation reeks, perhaps, of Bridget Jones, but comes from a thirty-two-year-old graphic designer, Rob Brooks. Brooks, the protagonist of Brand New Friend is neither female nor overweight nor slavishly infatuated with a boss bent on using him. Mike Gayle?s character, on the contrary, likes his work, has a group of buddies he enjoys spending time with and is in a serious relationship with a stunner. The problem lies elsewhere: his girlfriend, Ashley, is tired of their long-distance relationship (he works in London, she in Manchester) and insists that he give up his job, his friends ? his whole life, in fact ? and move in with her.

 Determined not to let their relationship founder, Rob agrees, only to be confronted by the realization that he has ended up ?utterly lost in translation? in a new environment. Without the defining factor of male friends, his sense of self is shaky at best, and seeking pals anew in one?s thirties is a Herculean task. On the verge of desperation, he even agrees to go on ?bloke-dates? with the men who respond to the advertisement a concerned Ashley puts in the classifieds on his behalf. The consequences are embarrassing for him and amusing for the reader. Danger lies, however, in Rob?s growing rapport with the brand new friend he finds at a party. For Jo is a woman. How Rob tries to conceal her gender from Ashley and triggers a crisis in their relationship constitutes the focus of the plot. 

 Everything does get sorted out, eventually, in the best chick-lit tradition, the lesson being that men and women can rarely be just friends; love inconveniently intrudes and brings its own complications. Not exactly the stuff of heavyweight literature, but then, the author makes no such tall claims. The novel fulfils, for the most part, its promise of being funny, entertaining and even moving in parts. 

 Gayle?s humour is wry and his touch sensitive and assured while handling some of life?s mundane situations ? the sense of alienation that is par for the course when meeting up with old friends whose lives have shot off at divergent tangents, scattering the common points of reference; the isolation that envelops those opting to work from home; and the near-ludicrous wariness that today?s multi-textured sexual climate has engendered about sending out the wrong signals by mistake. Gayle also reveals how attuned he is to the concerns of young educated urban men and women and to the tenor and thrust of their exchanges. It is as apparent in his insightful interpretation of different types of bonding as in his empathy for both sexes. 

 One cannot help wondering whether this is the sort of perk expected from a writer who was once an Agony Uncle. If so, it has its flip side too, showing up in irritatingly facile explanations and solutions or, in this case, in a rather glib epilogue, where everything works out for the best and no one is left moping. In fact, Jo seems to be speaking for Gayle, when she justifies the feel-good denouement of her own novel in the closing chapter. ?This is your world,? she tells herself, ?and these are your characters and whether they?re real or not I don?t think I?ve ever met two people more deserving of a fairy-tale ending?. 

 Which is, perhaps, fine for the fictional Jo and her debut novel, but hardly appropriate for a sixth-time author with a fan following.

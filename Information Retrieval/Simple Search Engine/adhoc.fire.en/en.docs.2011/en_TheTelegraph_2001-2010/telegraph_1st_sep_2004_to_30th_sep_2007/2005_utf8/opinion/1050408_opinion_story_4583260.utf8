 MARCH FOR A WORTHY CAUSE

The Romance of salt

By Anil Dharker, 

Roli, Rs 395

India is celebrating the 75th anniversary of Mahatma 

Gandhi?s historic Dandi march and Anil Dharker?s book, The Romance of Salt, 

is one among the many events that pays homage to this momentous occasion. 

 Dharker explains that the idea of writing a book on as innocuous a subject as salt took place in an equally benign place ? a muggy locker room. When one first gets to know about the subject of the book, the question that comes to mind is ? Why salt? The 75th anniversary of the Dandi march does call for a book on it. But one cannot be blamed for asking whether there can be a full-length book on such a subject. Interestingly, as if to quash these doubts, Dharker regales us with numerous stories and proverbs about this substance. 

 In his book, Dharker explores the history and the myth surrounding salt. While the first part talks about the Dandi march, the second explores the history of salt across centuries. In the first section, Dharker raises some pertinent questions ??Why salt? Why Dandi? Why a march??? and then goes on to answer them. He quotes extensively from Gandhi to reveal the visionary in him. Gandhi, writes Dharker, had meticulously planned all his actions, including those of the ashramites and the nation in general.

 The choice of Dandi as a destination for the march, and the route to Dandi itself was not a spontaneous decision, writes Dharker. For instance, Dharker points out that Sardar Patel had suggested that the route to Dandi should be a long one so as to give sufficient time for mobilization. Muslim-dominated areas were avoided because the Congress lacked support in them. Most importantly, Dharker proves that Gandhi had chosen salt as a symbol not for some complex reasons, as someone like Wolfenstein would have us believe, but because he was aware of the fact that ordinary people would identify with it easily.

 The latter part of Dharker?s book, and of course history, have proved that Gandhi was not wrong in his reasoning. Other nations, apart from India, have also witnessed conflicts in which salt played a major part ? the war between Genoa and Venice in the 14th century, the Seven Years? War in Europe, the American War of Independence and the American Civil War. It is here that Dharker scores by providing fascinating nuggets from history and myth. His book, quite intriguingly, provides hard facts as well as stories, proverbs and even recipes of pickles.

 The Romance of Salt is a fascinating book and it truly justifies what is written on its jacket ? ?you will never look at a salt shaker in the same way again.?

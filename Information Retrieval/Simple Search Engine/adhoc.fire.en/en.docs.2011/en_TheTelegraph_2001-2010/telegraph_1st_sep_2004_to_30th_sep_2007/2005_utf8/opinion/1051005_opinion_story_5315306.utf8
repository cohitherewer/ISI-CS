 WHICH WAY TO FLY?

 Abhijit Bhattacharyya

 For the Indian air force, completing 73 years on October 8, 2005, it is time for some introspection. The transformation of the Royal Indian air force to the independent IAF, is a story of glory, notwithstanding the unusually high rate of loss of frontline jet aircraft. The last had prompted the previous air chief to express his dismay at the institutional difficulty in maintaining the minimum number of 36 squadrons. Yet in the Eighties, the IAF had an operational readiness of 42 squadrons.

 What is the way out? Import or indigenization? Perhaps both. The present trend is to import, and reports show the presence of four manufacturers bidding for the 126 aircraft required by the IAF ? French Mirage-2000, Russian MiG-29, Swedish JAS-39 Gripen and the American F-16. 

 The time-tested French Mirage-2000 is a coveted jet for IAF pilots for the last two decades. The French appear to have caught the IAF?s fancy with its updated Mirage-2000-5. Little wonder, India has leased 12 aircraft from the inventory of the Qatar Air Force. The Russians too are optimistic, being India?s traditional suppliers of military hardware. They are offering their MiG-29 to the IAF. However, the IAF is aware that the production of land-based MiG-29s ended in the mid-Nineties, ?leaving substantial stock of semi-complete airframes available to meet export orders?. 

 Successful bidders

 The Swedes have always tried hard to market their Saab JAS 39 Gripen, first to Australia, where it lost to the US-made F-35. In Brazil, Gripen has had a suspension of order. The only consolations have been South Africa, a partial victory in Poland and a limited order placed by the Czech Republic. Till now, there is no Saab aircraft in the IAF inventory.

 The most robust of all the present bidders appears to be the US giant, Lockheed Martin. Though of vintage design and the most ?outdated? of the four competitors, the F-16 has undergone successive upgrade programmes since 1979. Presently, in the service of 21 air forces, F-16s hold the distinction of being one of the top aircraft. The bad news is that it has a tremendous backlog in production. 

 In the past, the IAF has had no problems in buying what it wanted to ? be it the French Mystere, or the English Canberra, Hunter or Gnat in the Fifties and the Sixties. In the Seventies, there were Soviet-manufactured MiG-21 and Sukhoi-7, followed by Jaguar from London and the Mirage of Paris in the Eighties. The Indian sky was dotted with fighters from Europe and the Soviet Union, while the American machines remained distant dreams. 

 On offer

 Combat squadrons of the IAF need fleet modernization, upgradation of the Mirage-Jaguar squadrons and fresh induction and replenishment of Sukhoi-30s. Till date, the advantage lay with Europe. The latest entry of the US in the fray is interesting, and given the security bonhomie between the countries, future developments may cause surprise. 

 But is the US willing to offer India its latest products ? the twin engined F-22 advanced tactical fighter, which is to be inducted by the US air force itself, and the single-engine multirole fighter, F-35, as the successor of the F-16? For there is a suspicion that when it comes to the best, the US is hesitant to consider India. India has been denied F-104 Starfighters, and the F-16s were offered a quarter of a century later.

 The contrast becomes stark because the French have not dithered to sell their latest aircraft. The Russians offered their best MiGs and Sukhois and the British their Hunters and Jaguars. Today?s IAF is at the crossroads. Any reduction in its squadron numbers has to be matched by machines serving as force multipliers.

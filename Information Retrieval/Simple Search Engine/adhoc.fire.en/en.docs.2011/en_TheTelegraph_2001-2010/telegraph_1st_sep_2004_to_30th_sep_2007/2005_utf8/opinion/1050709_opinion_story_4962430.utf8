 CLEANSING A DIRTY WORD

 This Above All 

/ Khushwant Singh

 End justifies means

 Emergency has been declared a dirty word. On its 30th anniversary everyone is busy condemning it as a blot on the face of Indian democracy. Let me jog people?s memories about what led to its imposition, how it came to be misused, and its aftermath.

 Recall the few months preceding the Emergency. The country was slowly but surely sliding into chaos. There were hartals, gheraos and bandhs on the flimsiest of pretexts. Schools and colleges remained closed for weeks on end; air and train services went haywire. The opposition led by Jayaprakash Narayan (a man I admired) decided to cash in on the increasing unrest to topple Mrs Gandhi from power. The mess Sanjay Gandhi had made of his Maruti project (despite Bansi Lal, the Haryana CM, providing him land) made them easy targets. Then Jayaprakash Narayan called for a bandh of state legislatures and the parliament and extorted the policy and army to revolt. 

 Quite clearly, this was going well beyond the limits of protest permitted in a democracy. No one should prevent an elected member of a legislative body from performing his duties. I wrote to Jayaprakashji, telling him that this was not done. He replied at great length. I published his letter in full in the journal I was then editing. Not a single opposition leader raised his voice against JP?s exceeding legitimate limits of protest. They just enjoyed Mrs Gandhi?s discomfiture.

 The Allahabad high court judgment, depriving her of the right to vote, precipitated the crisis. Despite her lawyer, Nani Palkhivala, assuring her that he would get the verdict over-ruled (he described it no more than a minor traffic offence) Mrs Gandhi?s close advisers, led by her son, Sanjay, and Siddhartha Shankar Ray, advised her to strike the opposition hard. And so she did by ordering arrests of all the chief opposition leaders, banning political parties and muzzling the press. It was danda therapy which yielded results. Take my word for it, when it was first imposed, the people sighed with relief as a semblance of normalcy came back. Schools and colleges started holding classes, shops opened, trains began to run on time. Everyone knew that a call for a strike or bandh would immediately land them in jail. Amongst the many who justified its imposition was Acharya Vinoba Bhave.

 There is reason to believe that Mrs Gandhi herself was surprised that there was hardly any resistance to the imposition of Emergency rule. It was easy to settle personal scores. Mrs Gandhi set a bad example. She had the maharanis, Gayatri Devi and Vijay Raje Scindia of Gwalior, locked up for no ostensible reason. Premila Lal and Swaminathan were picked up for doing nothing more than organizing farm workers around Mrs Gandhi?s farm. Romesh Thapar, editor of Seminar and one time trusted adviser, stopped publishing his journal. Her sleuths did not even spare his sister Romila: her house was searched and she was interrogated for many hours. She came hard on The Indian Express ? its premises were sealed. Kuldip Nayar was jailed. Sanjay had his traducers locked up. His wife Maneka and her mother Amtesh settled their own scores with people who got in their way. Ruksana Sultana became a women?s leader. Mohammed Yunus became a Pathan terror. Cabinet ministers like V.C. Shukla, Gokhaley, Bansi Lal became petty tyrants. Many civil servants showed extra enthusiasm in carrying orders or the royal family: among them Jagmohan, Navin Chawla, S. Chand, who later committed suicide. 

 The list of names of those who misused emergency powers is India-wide. They made Emergency into a dirty word. There is no truth whatsoever in the statement that the RSS opposed the Emergency. As a matter of fact, four Bombay leaders of the party asked me to intervene and persuade Mrs Gandhi to lift the ban on them. The only political party which kept up a nominal satyagrah against Emergency was the Akali Dal.

 Wildly exaggerated stories of how Sanjay?s cohorts went about picking up men from cinema houses and bus queues and forcibly sterilized them were circulated. No one has yet prepared a list of those who were in fact sterilized. But the false propaganda yielded handsome dividends. The highhandedness practised by some men and women in power explains Mrs Gandhi?s downfall in the elections that followed. That also explains why a couple of years later the people of India voted her and Sanjay back into parliament and power.

 The sea, 20 feet high

 A catastrophe of the magnitude of the tsunami which struck early morning on the day after Christmas last year will remain embedded in people?s minds for times to come. An earthquake of 9.2 Richter scale shook the bottom of the sea, devastated coastal areas of Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and India. It took a toll of nearly 300,000 lives. While humans remained unaware of what was coming, birds and animals sensed its onslaught. Dogs, cats and monkeys fled to places of safety. Elephants are reported to have trumpeted loudly, warning humans to run for their lives. Some went to the extent of grabbing them by their trunks and hoisting them on their backs and taking them to safety. It was inevitable that the tsunami would stir human imagination, particularly of artists, poets and writers.

 I have two books on the subject. One by Satindra Bindra, who covered the event for CNN, entitled Tsunami: 7 Hours That Shook the World, and a collection of poems, Only the Sea Keeps: Poetry of the Tsunami, edited by Judith R. Robinson, Joan E. Bauer and Sankar Roy.

 Bindra gives a vivid account of how tsunami destroyed lives and habitations of thousands of innocent people. He is perhaps the first to remind us of it. The collection of poems is more subjective but of uneven quality. The one which struck a chord in my mind is by Indran Amirthanayagam, a Tamilian (Sri Lankan or Indian, I could not make out) who writes both in English and Spanish and is now in the US foreign service. It is entitled ?Green Sea?. I quote the latter part of this poem:

 20 foot high/ breakers/ make fun/ of the makeshift/ matted boat/ setting out/ for the first time/ since December 26th,/ hungry family/ waiting for the catch,

 No other way/ but face the waves/ again, yet questions/ persists about moves/ to the city

 Of the mountains/ images of green/ fields, bulbs, beetroot,/ milking cows mixed/ with furious swells.

 In daydreams and/ nightmares, yet/ the sea?s father/ and mother/ karma and dharma

 And all other/ available terms/ including fate/ to explain/ why waves killed

 25 members of/ my neighbour?s family/ but spared me/ to see/ this sea green.

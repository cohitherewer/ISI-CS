 MUHABBAT-I-MUSHARRAF

 - For the General, diplomacy is war by another means

 WRITING ON THE WALL / ASHOK 

 V. DESAI

 Musharraf is the

 man who slipped a fast one in Kargil, who

 refused to salute Vajpayee in Lahore, who turned

 Agra into a tamasha. And now he comes and starts

 talking of having a new heart, pays compliments

 to Manmohan Singh, goes calling on Vajpayee. Has

 he really changed? Or is he just pretending?

 At the time of

 Partition, Pakistan suffered three reverses. One

 was the loss of Kashmir. Pakistan sent a ragtag

 army to conquer it. K.P.S. Menon flew to

 Srinagar with an Instrument of Accession,

 Maharaja Hari Singh signed it toute suite, the

 Indian army threw out the intruders and occupied

 most of Kashmir. Another was the loss of

 Junagadh. After the Nawab acceded to Pakistan,

 Kanaiyal Munshi collected a few dhotiwallas,

 some rusty swords and ladders and climbed over

 the walls of Junagadh. So that he should come to

 no harm, the Indian army followed. The Nawab

 took a boat to Karachi with his dogs. The third

 was Hyderabad. On 15 August, 1947, the British

 ceded sovereignty, and gave the Princes

 independence. The Nawab thought that was for

 real, and declared independence. Indian

 newspapers reported that Razakars, his irregular

 troops, were attacking and oppressing his Hindu

 subjects. The Indian army was sent in to restore

 order, and put a quick end to the Nawab's

 independence.

 So Pakistan

 started with a generous stock of umbrage. The

 first chance to take revenge came in 1965. India

 was in an economic crisis and on the verge of

 famine. Nehru had died, and little Shastri had

 taken over. Troops of both countries skirmished

 in April 1965 in the Rann of Kutch. The Indian

 troops withdrew, and Pakistan claimed victory.

 In August, Pakistan slipped in troops into

 Kashmir; India attacked near Lahore in

 retaliation. In January 1966, the moustachioed

 President Mohammad Ayub Khan met Shastri in

 Tashkent and signed an agreement. Both sides

 ceased fire, returned occupied territory and

 freed prisoners. It was an honourable peace that

 could be passed off as 

 victory by both sides, and they did.

 Then in 1971,

 India attacked East Pakistan, severed it and

 took 90,000 Pakistani troops prisoner. Ayub Khan

 abdicated, and Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto became prime

 minister. This time there was no meeting on

 neutral territory; Bhutto had to go to Simla hat

 in hand and plead with the victorious Indira

 Gandhi. He told his teenage daughter, Benazir,

 quot; quot;Do not smile; remember our soldiers

 who died and are imprisoned. And do not look

 grim, otherwise the Press will say the talks are

 doomed. quot; quot;Yet, it was difficult to

 look unhappy as our Indian hosts smilingly and

 happily met us. The warmth of their reception

 was infectious, even if Indian Premier Gandhi

 was more aloof, quot; wrote Benazir recently.

 The defeat could

 not be passed off as victory, so it was passed

 off as Bhutto's treason. Lieutenant General

 Javed Naser, ex-chief of Inter-Services

 Intelligence, writing in October 2004, charged

 that Bhutto agreed to two different conditions

 in the Simla agreement. It said that Indian and

 Pakistani armies would be withdrawn to their

 side of the international border. But quot;In

 Jammu and Kashmir, the line of control resulting

 from the ceasefire of December 17, 1971, shall

 be respected by both sides without prejudice to

 the recognised position of either side. quot; In

 other words, both sides could keep the gains

 they had made in Kashmir. Amongst them

 apparently were the heights on the way to Kargil

 occupied by the Indian army. Bhutto understood

 the implications according to Naser, but

 accepted the terms to humiliate the Pakistani

 army. Having occupied the Kargil heights, the

 Indian army built a road to Ladakh along the

 Shyok river, and went on to occupy Siachen in

 1984.

 Then follow two

 versions. Naser's is that in 1989, General Aslam

 Beg, Chief of General Staff (CGS), presented a

 plan to President Ghulam Ishaq Khan and PM

 Benazir Bhutto: the heights of Kafir Pahar,

 Damgul, Tortuk Challunka on the way to Kargil

 should be occupied. That would 

 cut off Siachen and force the Indians to vacate

 it. Benazir rejected the plan because it would

 lead to a war. General Beg felt that India could

 not afford a war since it had sent three

 divisions to Sri Lanka, but he was not prepared

 to stage a coup. According to Lt Gen Sikandar

 Khan Baloch, however, this plan as well as the

 one to train and slip in terrorists into Kashmir

 were made by President Zia-ul-Haq. By 1998, the

 terrorist operation in Kashmir was in full

 swing; the supply of terrorists trained by

 Pakistan had increased to a point

 where their tour of service across the border

 was as short as 18 months. The Indian army was

 stretched. No party had a majority in the Indian

 Parliament, which was headed towards another

 election. In May, Pakistan staged its nuclear

 ceremony; after that India could not risk a

 general war. So, according to Javed Naser,

 General Musharraf, whom Nawaz Sharif had made

 CGS, implemented the 1989 plan and infiltrated

 soldiers in fortified positions along the Kargil

 heights in March 1999. Sharif was told that the

 heights had been occupied by Kashmiri

 terrorists.

 Their presence was

 a complete surprise to the Indian army. The

 Vajpayee government decided to keep the conflict

 local and not to cross the LoC. That limited the

 scope for using air power. The Indian army could

 not slip behind the Kargil heights because it

 would have been exposed to Pakistani shelling.

 That left the task largely to infantrymen

 climbing steep hills against fire from dug-in

 positions. So India took huge casualties.

 Revenge at last.

 Except that the

 Pakistanis could not withdraw their troops from

 the heights under Indian fire. So Sharif had to

 go to Washington and plead with Clinton, who put

 pressure on Vajpayee to let the Pakistani troops

 withdraw. Which he did. Kargil too turned out

 like the Bangladesh war ? Pakistan had to

 plead for a favour and retreat publicly. Why did

 Musharraf, the architect of Kargil, start talks

 with Vajpayee? 

 Because he saw a chink. In Lahore, Vajpayee did

 not impress with his statesmanship or his

 astuteness. On Kargil, he showed himself to be a

 novice incapable of learning an elementary

 military lesson ? that it was suicidal to send

 infantry to take fortified hill positions. So

 Musharraf thought he would try his hand at

 talking to Vajpayee ? maybe

 trap him in talks as he had done in war.

 Unfortunately, unable to win a mandate to

 negotiate, Vajpayee confronted Musharraf in Agra

 with the entire bellicose top brass of the BJP.

 Musharraf saw that he would get nowhere, so he

 gave a pyrotechnic TV show before Indian editors

 and flew back.

 Why, now, has he

 changed so? Why is he so nice about Manmohan

 Singh? Maybe because it is impossible to do

 otherwise. Manmohan Singh may be easy to disdain

 or underestimate; but he is a difficult man to

 dislike. He is warm, courteous and attentive. He

 neither trades insults nor hurls pseudo-history

 at Musharraf. He does not talk the costive

 language of foreign affairs. And he is always

 looking for some forward step.

 But Musharraf is

 nice also because no other strategy shows

 promise at the moment. He has not given up on

 hostility; if another opportunity offers itself,

 he will try it out. For lack of anything else,

 why not try charm? And being the earnest,

 energetic, indefatigable man that he is, he will

 apply charm full strength: for the general,

 diplomacy is war by another means. But he will

 not do anything that would increase the cost of

 hostility or benefits of a rapprochement to

 Pakistan ? open up trade and investment, for

 example.

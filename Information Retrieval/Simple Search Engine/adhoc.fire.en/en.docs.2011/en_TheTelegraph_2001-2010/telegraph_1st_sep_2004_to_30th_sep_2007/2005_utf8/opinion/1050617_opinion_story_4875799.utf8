 INTRIGUES AND ROAST CHICKEN

 Around the world

 Westward Bound: Travels of Mirza Abu Taleb

 Edited by Mushirul Hasan, 

 Oxford, Rs 495

 The colonization of India was in a way strangely antithetical. It was regressive, characterized by the ruination of an indigenous people and its economy. But it also offered an opportunity for two distinct cultures to discover each other, paving the way for progress through this interaction.

 There is a rich body of works on the discovery of the ?Orient? ? travelogues, books, journals and diaries, maintained by European travellers. But records of how the East looked upon Europe, especially Muslim perceptions of the West, are fewer. However, Abu Taleb?s travelogue, Masir-I Talibi fi Bilad-I Afrang, is one of the foremost treatise on the Muslim discovery of 19th-century Europe.

 Abu Taleb was born into a world of palace intrigues that so typified the Muslim nobility in those times. His father sought refuge in Awadh to escape from the tyrannical Nadir Shah. Soon, he fell foul of the nawab and was forced to flee to Murshidabad. With the new ruler favourably disposed towards his family, a young Abu Taleb retraced his steps to Awadh to serve as Etawah?s samildar, making his first ?acquaintance and connection with the English?. But the transfer of his benefactors once again forced him to flee, this time to Calcutta, where he met a genial Scotsman who offered to bear his expenses for a trip to Europe. Abu Taleb accepted his offer in the hope that the perilous journey would cause his death and free him from his misery.

 Modern readers would find it difficult to imagine the hardships which Taleb faced ? unhealthy quarters, mutinous shipmen, disease and the raging sea. Yet, the man set about recording his voyage with remarkable dexterity, a tale rich in anecdotes and observations. Thus Capetown was ?about six miles in circumference? and inhabited by insolent and corrupt Dutch men and women who were ?fat, gross and insipid?. St Helena was once populated with wild goats which inconvenienced the British settlers by dislodging large stones on the roofs of houses built under the precipices, forcing them to decimate the herd. Dublin fascinated him with its many carriages, the Irish men with their drinking and the women who glided down the busy thoroughfares without touching others in the crowd.

 But nothing could take away from the charms of Britain. He was visiting a country in the middle of a great social and economic churning brought about by industrialization. The mills for grinding corn, iron foundries, and even the device for roasting chicken showed the British mastery over machines. Abu Taleb was also captivated with the liberties enjoyed by the women, but shocked by their ?lack of chastity?. His manners and wit made him popular with the elite as the ?Persian Prince?, causing him much discomfiture. But he thought that the British suffered from pride, avarice, irritability and unbelief.

 His return journey took him to Paris. Abu Taleb found the French courteous, affable, but given to flattery. Genoa impressed him with its fruit, while a thief made off with one half of his turban in Leghorn! Constantinople was a mix of opulence and squalor, with its gardens, hamlets and filthy inns. He also visited Baghdad, and later, the shrines of Kerbala and Nejif.

 Finally, he reached Bombay, renowned for its ?purity of air, and the excellence of its water?. From there, after four years and six months, he landed in Calcutta, quite impervious to the rare feat that he had accomplished.

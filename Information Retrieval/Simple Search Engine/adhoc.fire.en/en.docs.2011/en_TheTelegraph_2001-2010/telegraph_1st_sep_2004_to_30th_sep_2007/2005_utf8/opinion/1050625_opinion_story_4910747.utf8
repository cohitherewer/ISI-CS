 HANG DEMOCRACY!

 It takes little time to make a blunder ? but a great deal more to undo it. It is understandable that a man of culture would feel particularly at home in Calcutta?s Nandan complex. But when Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee got off his car inside the complex the other day, his feeling of proprietorship of the place must have been quite special. His eyes fell on the posters of the documentary film being shown there ? Mr Joshy Joseph?s One Day From a Hangman?s Life. This is a film about Mr Nata Mullick, who had carried out Dhananjoy Chatterjee?s hanging, and takes a principled stand against hanging, although it presents its case in a complex and nuanced manner. The chief minister immediately flew into a rage at the sight of the posters, and reportedly ordered them to be removed and the screening of the documentary stopped. An exhibition of posters on the same theme was also going on at Nandan. This was also stopped. What followed is worse. It was given out that the screenings had been stopped because enough tickets were not being sold. If this were true, most screenings in Nandan would have to be stopped. In fact, it would then become altogether difficult to justify Nandan?s existence.

 Mr Joshy?s film had been passed by the censors without any cuts. Moreover, the Nandan bureaucracy was perfectly aware of the contents of the film, and had allowed its screening. Therefore, the arbitrariness of Mr Bhattacharjee?s intervention becomes all the more shocking. No less shocking is the unquestioning obedience it met with from the Nandan officials. There is something especially unsavoury about the spectacle of a dictator who lacks the courage of his convictions, and his readily compliant underlings. And this ?small? incident becomes a telling expos? of the nature and inner workings of a state-sponsored institution like Nandan ? ironically, one that professes to stand for the avant garde in the city?s culture. It must be granted to the country?s more unabashed bigots that they do such things with greater panache. The Shiv Sena, the Bajrang Dal or the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh would never bother to invent sly excuses for their bigotries. It is the bhadralok?s intolerance and abuse of power which appear unpleasantly two-faced in comparison.

 The implications for democracy in West Bengal ? particularly for freedom of expression in the arts ? are obviously grave. The best documentary films ? and Mr Joshy?s films have won national awards ? are often free explorations of polemical issues, keeping alive a tradition of critical debate that is vital for the sustenance of any democracy. The debate on capital punishment addresses an ethical quandary, which is far from resolved by the fact of Chatterjee?s hanging. By trying to shut this debate up so mindlessly, Mr Bhattacharjee has seriously compromised his cherished intellectual and political credentials.

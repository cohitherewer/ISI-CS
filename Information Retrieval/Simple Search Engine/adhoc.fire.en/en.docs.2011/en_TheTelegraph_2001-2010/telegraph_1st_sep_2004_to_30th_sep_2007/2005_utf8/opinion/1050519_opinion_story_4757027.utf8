 COST IN BLOOD

 The horror in Andizhan in eastern Uzbekistan that began on Friday last has not yet been fully revealed to the world. Soldiers began by firing on demonstrators who had gathered in a square, demanding that the president, Mr Islam Karimov, begin negotiating with armed protestors who had stormed a prison and taken control of an administration building. The victims of the state?s bloodthirstiness were mostly civilians, men, women and children, whose blood, body parts and brains spattered the streets of the town. The dead apparently number in the thousands, according to the refugees fleeing into neighbouring Kyrgyzstan. This is already being considered the biggest human rights violation by a state since Tiananmen Square. The echoes resonate in other ways too. Washington has trodden gently, asking both sides to restrain themselves. Human rights violations by friendly governments have never been an issue worth too much comment for the United States of America.

 Mr Karimov, the president in office since 1990, has been a true friend of the US. By offering an airbase to it in Khanabad during the American attack on Afghanistan, Uzbekistan has become a valued US ally in the ?war on terror?. Mr Karimov?s methods of staying in power have naturally been overlooked, although Uzbekistan has the most terrible record of silencing dissent among its neighbours. Russia is not critical either. Three ex-Soviet republics have replaced their rulers recently with more democratically inclined governments: Georgia and Ukraine after ?bloodless revolutions? and Kyrgyzstan after a violent one. Russia would rather have Mr Karimov in place.

 The cycle of violence begun by the state with torture and intimidation of minority groups, has led to the imprisonment of about 7,000 people for political and religious reasons. The taking of a local prison had a symbolic role. Among the prisoners were 23 businessmen belonging to Akramiya, a Muslim group which sought change through economic means. Mr Karimov had lumped it with all groups he considers extremist, his focus now being on Hizb ut-Tahrir, which he blames for Friday?s uprising as well as earlier bomb attacks. The group denies both, but Mr Karimov has managed to make the magic al Qaida connection. Repression and torture ? varieties of rape of the prisoner?s close kin, and immersion of the prisoner?s body in boiling liquid being two favoured methods ? have their corollary in poverty. Protest, sharpened by the closing of a bridge that allowed Uzbek traders to reach Kyrgyz markets, had as much to do with poverty as with rebellion against oppression. But the scale of the abuse this time may have made Mr Karimov too hot to handle even for his friends abroad.

 PARTY SPOILS

 The loss of power often shows up a party for what it is worth. The squabbles within the Bharatiya Janata Party have proved it once again. But what is happening within the party in Jharkhand points to the problems of power. The BJP should have been sitting pretty in Jharkhand after the dramatic post-election developments that brought it to power in the state. Instead, the party now faces a possible revolt from within. To make matters worse for it, the rebellion is led by none other than the former chief minister, Mr Babulal Marandi, who also happens to be one of the national vice-presidents of the party. The ostensible reason is the nomination of Mr Jadunath Pandey as president of the party?s Jharkhand unit. There seems to be some justification in Mr Marandi?s complaint that the central leadership of the party chose Mr Pandey without consulting the majority of the party leaders in the state. This, in his view, exposed the party?s ?undemocratic? ways. There is the other view, though, that Mr Marandi?s revolt has more to do with his frustration at being marginalized on his home turf. All signs point to a tussle over the spoils of power after the party managed to secure a second term in office. 

 The most disquieting aspect, of course, is the danger that the party games pose to the state?s administration. The real battle seems to be between Mr Marandi and the chief minister, Mr Arjun Munda. The government survives on the support of half a dozen independent members of the assembly, all of whom have been made ministers in Mr Munda?s cabinet. But the validity of their membership is threatened by the disqualification notices that have been pending with the speaker of the assembly. Add this to the number of BJP MLAs who are supposedly loyal to Mr Marandi, and it makes a very uncomfortable sum for the chief minister. It is easy to imagine what all this is doing to the administration. An administrative confusion can be dangerous in a state where the Maoist rebels pose a major threat to peace in many areas. Also, large sections of the state?s people live in acute poverty. Even their survival sometimes depends on a prompt intervention by the government. Only a stable and sensitive government can at least try to reach food, healthcare and basic education to these people. The BJP?s promise of good governance does not seem to mean anything to the leaders in Ranchi.

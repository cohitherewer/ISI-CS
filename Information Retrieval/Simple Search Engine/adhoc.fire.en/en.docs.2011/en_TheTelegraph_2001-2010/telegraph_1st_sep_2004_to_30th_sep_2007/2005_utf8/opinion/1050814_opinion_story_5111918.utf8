 Environmentalist vs Environmentalist

 - Resettling villagers will cost more than Rs 1,600 crore 

A report tabled last week by the Prime Ministers 

Tiger Task Force has sparked off a fierce battle among green activists. The issue: 

whether or not human presence in the wildlands should be taken into consideration 

while conserving the tiger. Anirban Das Mahapatra reports

Okay, so who knows best how to save the tiger? Environmentalists, 

or environmentalists? 

 More than a week after a report prepared by the Prime Ministers Tiger Task Force ? titled Joining the Dots ? was tabled, the two schools of environmentalists advocating the cause of tiger conservation continue to fall out when it comes to finding a unified answer to the question. 

 The end is common; the means are what has put the environmentalists at loggerheads. And the impasse seems to have brought to prominence more grey areas than a study in striped black and yellow normally would. 

 That the presence of the Royal Bengal Tiger in the Indian subcontinent was threatened, and that the system put in place to safeguard its habitat and existence had long collapsed, are no longer in dispute. What continues to be debated, however, is whether or not human presence in the wildlands should be taken into consideration while giving conservation a shot. 

 The task-force ? headed by environmentalist Sunita Narain ? says yes. Owing to the circumstances in India, where forests are not wilderness areas but where people also live, it argues that discounting ethnic populations could bring about a major imbalance in the conservation programme. The conservationists lobby, on the other hand, begs to differ. If the report is implemented, it will only dot out the tiger, mocks Ashok Kumar, trustee of the Wildlife Trust of India. 

 With conservationist Valmik Thapar ? one of the five members of the task force ? having put down his dissent on paper, all constructive dialogue between the two lobbies has come to a standstill. What goes on unabated is a heated verbal exchange, a clash of emotion and reason, and an ideological battle with man and animal on opposite poles. 

 But frankly, is there any option other than coexistence? asks Narain, director of the Centre for Science and Environment, New Delhi. When one considers that only 80 villages have been relocated ever since Project Tiger was initiated in 1972, is there any saying how difficult it would be to clear all core areas of human habitation? Has anyone ever thought about the logistics involved, she asks. 

 Point, counterpoint

 The report estimates that 273 villages continue to exist in the core areas of Indian tiger reserves today. Apart from the fact that many are situated in Naxalite-controlled areas ? from where relocation would be difficult ? it could cost the government well over Rs 600 crore to shift villagers currently living in core areas, and above Rs 1,600 crore to resettle them all. At present, the allocation for the relocation scheme within Project Tiger happens to be limited to Rs 10-15 crore for the five years of the tenth plan. 

 They have accused me of being pro-tribal, says Narain. Their one-point agenda has been to press for complete relocation. But do they have a logical answer to how it can be made possible? 

 The they in question are the powerful conservationists fighting Narain. Among them is Thapar, who stayed away from last Fridays report presentation at the Prime Ministers residence and now chooses to remain silent. I have expressed my dissent in writing, and I dont want to comment on the issue any further, is all that he would say. 

 If task force members are to believed, Thapar had apparently stopped doing the talking much in advance. He did not travel to reserves with us, says a task force member. He didnt even think it necessary to attend most of our meetings. He had no wish to sit with us and work out solutions to the crisis. 

 But many in the wildlife faction support Thapars stance, echoing his views that the task force, meant to save the tiger, had strayed into upholding tribal rights. Kumar, for one, does not believe that relocation poses problems. When a dam is built, the government doesnt think twice before throwing people out of their villages, he argues. 

 Why cant the same principle be applied to tiger conservation? If the government dishes out the money and uses NGOs to carry out the fieldwork, relocation is indeed possible. 

 Not all environmentalists are sure that it is necessary, though. The report observes that save a few areas where the chalking out of inviolate spaces is an imperative, there are several other reserves where man and tiger can well coexist. A few cases in point are the reserves in Kalakkad [Tamil Nadu], Periyar [Kerala] and Kanha [Madhya Pradesh], says current Project Tiger director Rajesh Gopal. While these cannot be cited as examples to implement a blanket policy, they go to show that coexistence is very much an option and could be practised where possible. 

 SAVING THE TIGER: The fate of the endangered animal 

now hangs in a balance

Clearly, there are circles within circles in the environmentalists 

lobby ? and signs of a serious battle brewing. Dehra Dun-based tribal rights activist 

Avdhash Kaushal blows the whistle on Kumars theory of disbursing funds to 

NGOs for purposes of relocation. They [the NGOs] only know how to swindle 

money, he rants. Its easy to pose as a wildlife expert in our 

country and meet personal interests in the name of conservation. 

 Like Kaushal, some environmentalists believe that every tiger lovers motive is not always above board. There are whispers about some conservationists bidding to control wildlife reserves for what is often seen as monetary and personal reasons. Some wildlife enthusiasts are said to have links with luxury hotels running in the vicinity of parks. Some argue that while high-end resorts mint money by marketing the tiger, the villager is out of the tourist loop. 

Burning questions

 The report cites the example of Ranthambhore, which registered a tourist footfall of 1,11,000 through 2003-2004. But local villagers remained a frustrated lot, deprived of a share of a tourism pie baked in their own backyard. If these angry villagers turn poachers tomorrow, is the government to blame? questions a wildlife expert, seeking anonymity. 

 The way out ? the report argues ? is by taking the reins of conservation out of the hands of a few, to be invested in the hands of many. Over the years, tiger conservation has become exclusive, the report notes. And tiger lovers have banded together into a select group in an attempt to centralise decisions and get the power to protect the tiger. Everybody else, they increasingly believe, is against the tiger, it states. 

 The new report has tried to rid tiger conservation of this fortress model and, apart from involving people at all levels, is extremely well-balanced in its approach to the urgent issue of conservation, says Gopal. Its unfortunate that some people have not understood its basic strategy. 

 But the strategy ? that animals and villagers need to coexist ? is an old one. Several earlier reports have harped on coexistence. Ironically, none of the previous studies ? which sought to elicit public support for conservation and prescribed self-sustainable eco-development schemes for people living in forest areas ? was implemented in its entirety. 

 Thats a fact that makes P.V. Jayakrishnan, former secretary of the ministry of environment and forests and a member of the Supreme Courts Central Empowered Committee, look upon the new report with cynicism. Whats the use in coming out with a report every five or 10 years, when no one is willing to implement it? he says. 

 A plethora of reports

 The Project Tiger blueprint: Presented 

in August 1972 by a committee headed by current Rajya Sabha member Karan Singh. 

Chalked out the future path for Indias tiger conservation programme 

 The Scindia report: Presented by the Task Force on Public Support 

for Wildlife Conservation, chaired by Madhavrao Scindia. Focused on the dependence 

of rural communities on forests and suggested an ecodevelopment programme and 

employment benefits from reserves for local people 

 The Dutta Committee report: Tabled in 1996 by group headed by 

J.J. Dutta, former chief conservator of forests, Madhya Pradesh. Argued that while 

clearing human habitation from tiger reserves was ideal, it was not a management 

imperative 

Inefficiency on the part of the government in following 

up reports in the past has been the primary reason for the subsequent mismanagement 

of Indias wildlands, feels current task force member H.S. Panwar, also a 

former Project Tiger director and founder member of the Wildlife Institute of 

India. Had the 1972 report, which led to the birth of Project Tiger, been 

implemented and followed up adequately, we wouldnt have had to see this 

day, he laments. 

 But even as Panwar hopes the new report will set things rolling in the right direction, P.K. Sen, director of tiger conservation, World Wide Fund for Nature (India), has his doubts. Two of the five task force members, Samar Singh and H.S. Panwar, are from the Madhya Pradesh cadre, he says. And so is Project Tiger director Rajesh Gopal. How can you say they are not upholding the agenda of the states former chief minister Digvijay Singh to dilute policies in the country? The report is closely linked to the pending Tribal Bill, and just makes things easy for politicians who are trying to push it. 

 Future tense

 Whether or not Sens apprehensions are true is a question that will be answered with passing time. At the moment, though, all that matters is saving the tiger. Wildlife activist and filmmaker Mike Pandey advocates the middle path. Relocation, though unfortunate, may need to be carried out in select areas, observes Pandey. But elsewhere, harmonic coexistence could well be a better solution. The authorities need to look at each zone on a local basis, plan strategies accordingly, and back it up with solid work at all levels. And treating forests as personal fiefdoms will not do anyone any good, he says. 

 That, however, seems a distant possibility, considering that it will take a while before the acrimonious bickering dies down. Hopefully, there will still be a few tigers left in the jungles to benefit from the final outcome of the debate, if and when it ends. 

 Somewhere, in a dingy prison cell, Sansar Chand ? poacher par excellence ? must be laughing himself silly.

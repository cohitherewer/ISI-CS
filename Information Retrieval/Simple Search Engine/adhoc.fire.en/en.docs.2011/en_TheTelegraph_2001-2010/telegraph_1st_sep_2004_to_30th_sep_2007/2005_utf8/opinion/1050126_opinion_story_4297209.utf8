 BRUTE FORCE

 Can there be a distinction between the use and abuse of violence? When defence academies teach their young students the art of warfare, how is this distinction to be simultaneously inculcated? For when it collapses, the consequences can be inhuman. Trained in combat and empowered by their uniforms, some jawans from the Rajputana Rifles and the Border Security Force have allegedly thrown a number of passengers out of the unreserved compartment of a moving, Delhi-bound express train in Uttar Pradesh. Five of the passengers thrown out were immediately hit and killed by another train. The jawans had barged into the compartment, which was not reserved for military personnel, demanded that seats be vacated for them, and when the passengers did not comply these havildars and lance naiks started abusing them verbally and physically, threatening to send them ?flying into the fields?. They proved true to their words, and have now been charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder.

 The timing could not have been more ironic, with the nation?s military might then preparing for its most spectacularly non-violent parade today. Moreover, the army has also been thinking of implementing a policy to put younger officers upfront on battlefields. And the new defence academy near Siliguri, India?s largest and most advanced, will impart training not only in weapons but also in initiative and leadership. These havildars on the Delhi-bound train obviously lacked neither initiative nor leadership. Something must have gone fundamentally wrong with their training and subsequent discipline. Apart from brutality on civilians (particularly in the border areas), the army has long been the home of varied forms of corruption (rations scams, fake encounters). Its largely autonomous and insulated punitive system might also contribute to making its more irresponsible members feel that they are outside the ordinary bounds of law and order, or even of human behaviour. High levels of stress could also reinforce these eruptions of violence, often directed within the force, such as harried jawans or security personnel opening fire among themselves in fits of temper. But stress is perhaps the most charitable interpretation. It is the abuse of power, of the privileges of carrying arms and wearing a uniform, that is most often at the root of such brutality.

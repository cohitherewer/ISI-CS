 WRONG STRESS

 Student stress seems to be the government?s latest worry. A number of reforms in syllabi, and in the structure and methods of teaching and examining have been introduced at various levels, from school to university, Centrally and in some states, all intending to lessen the burden of students, and to rescue education, particularly higher education, from unhealthy competition and utilitarianism. From increasing the amount of time allowed an examinee to read the question paper to the introduction of the semester system, state and Central education boards, authorities and ministries have been busying themselves trying to make learning lighter, if not easier. The reforms introduced in the IIT entrance examinations by the human resource development ministry are also motivated by such good intentions, together with an attempt to break the stranglehold of the ubiquitous coaching classes. The class XII board examinations are now going to count towards the entrance qualifications, the nature of the questions will be slightly altered, and a few other prohibitions introduced, ostensibly to prevent the commodification of academic excellence.

 But all these reforms, though done for the ?sake? of the students, enhance the controlling power of the HRD ministry, and make the entire qualifying process more centralized. The joint entrance examinations could actually be subjected to a more fundamental scrutiny. Are they at all necessary? Wouldn?t it be a better idea to do away with them altogether? Each of the Indian Institutes of Technology is a powerful and premier institution, which should enjoy the autonomy of conducting its own entrance examinations according to its own ethos of excellence. Central ministries should have as little as possible to do with these processes. Even rules like disallowing students to shift courses within the institute, once they have been admitted, should be a matter of internal decisions, according to internal evaluation of each particular case. Flexibility in what one is allowed to study, based on evolving self-awareness, might even be a good thing in quality higher education in many cases. It is in the nature of governmental intervention to flatten out such instances under absolute and generalized rules and prohibitions. Independence is more important than unsolicited help in stress-management.

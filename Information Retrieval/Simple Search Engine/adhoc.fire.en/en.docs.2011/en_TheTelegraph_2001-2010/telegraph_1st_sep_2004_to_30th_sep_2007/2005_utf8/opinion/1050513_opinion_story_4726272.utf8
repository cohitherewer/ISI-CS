 THE PEOPLE?S WRITER

 The Mulk Raj Anand Omnibus, 

 Edited by Saros Cowasjee, 

 Viking, Rs 695

 ?I believe in the reference back to the people, the despised, the insulted and the injured, to their collective unconscious.? wrote Mulk Raj Anand in a letter to K. V. S. Murti. The words clearly establish the fact that the novelist Mulk Raj Anand was interested in exploring the theme of caste- and class-based exploitation. His early works bear testimony to this fact. 

 But what is more interesting is that Anand, unlike many of his contemporaries, fought shy of the radical Marxist critiques of colonialism and the capitalist economy. Instead, his narratives are informed with a unique pantheism which, as his letters suggest, derive a lot from the Bhakti cult and intend to evoke the Buddhist ?Karuna?. History, embodied in Anand?s narratives, represents ugly breaches in a grand, all-encompassing ethical scheme. This brings the author close to Gandhi. But, even here, Anand?s allegiance, though sincere, is not unqualified or dogmatic.

 Saros Cowasjee, a novelist in his own right, wrote a commendable book on Anand called So Many Freedoms earlier. Now, in this ?special commemorative edition?, he includes three of Anand?s best-known works ? Untouchable, Coolie and Private Life of an Indian Prince. Cowasjee, inexplicably, does not clarify his selection strategy. To be fair to him though, the selection, with its heavily structured and lyrical prose interspersed with piquant irony and sarcasm. represents the the best aspects of Anand as a writer.

 Untouchable, the story of the discrimination faced by young Bakha, a Dalit sweeper, on a single day historical time, plays out its tension with devastating effect. The conclusion is somewhat tame, and one in which Anand captures the reigning doubts of his time that were born out of the Gandhian and the Nehruvian vision of a free and self-sufficient India.

 Coolie chronicles the travails of Munoo, a boy from a village, as he holds odd jobs in cities and towns. Anand?s prose, as Cowasjee mentions in his introduction, is more varied and delicately intoned here than in Untouchable.

 Private Life of an Indian Prince talks about an arrogant Indian aristocrat. The interplay of irony and satire in this story unravels the shallow pretensions of a crumbling aristocratic family in the years after Independence.

 Anand?s novels do provide a ?reference back? to the ?collective unconscious? of historical subjects. At the same time, they offer glimpses of an intelligent, eclectic mind that looks at history, and an individual?s interpretation of the subject, in a new light.

 Letters to Editor

 Road map

 Sir ? The decision of the West Bengal government to remove hand-pulled rickshaws from Calcutta is a welcome decision (?Modern solution?, Aug 20). It would be a good idea to compensate the rickshaw-pullers by replacing their vehicles with auto-rickshaws. In all the other metros, that is, Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Bangalore, autos are the main form of contract carriage. There is no reason why it should not be so in Calcutta. In fact, taxis are becoming increasingly unaffordable, so the government may consider replacing most of the existing taxis by LPG/CNG autos, to ply around the city strictly on meter. These will be more pocket-friendly and easily manoeuvrable. The government could spare some thought on this.

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Since hand-pulled rickshaws are slow for obvious reasons, it is justified to take them off the roads. But instead of selecting polluting and noisy auto-rickshaws, why can?t the authorities go in for cycle-rickshaws?

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Sir ? Sure, pulling rickshaws is not the most humane of jobs. But at least it is a legal way of earning a living. The deployment of children as labour is far more inhuman. Besides, it is illegal. And yet, we see thousands of children working at roadside stalls or as domestic help. If our chief minister is indeed concerned about inhuman employment, why does he not rescue the children, who should be in school but are working instead? He can easily find a few working in the pavement stalls outside the Writers? Buildings.

 Yours faithfully,

Raj Bagri, Calcutta

 Sir ? I find it rather surprising that vehicles drawn by human beings have been patronized by the people of Calcutta for so long. This is the 21st century, and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is perfectly justified in wanting to do away with these miserable rickshaws. It is a step in the right direction, especially when the use of motorized and mechanized vehicles is on the rise even in the rural areas. But knowing Calcutta, I am sure there will be enough people to say that these dilapidated carriers are safe enough to ferry their children to and from school or are ideal for crossing water-logged roads. 

 In this connection, I want to cite the example of Chennai. Prior to 1972, hand-pulled rickshaws plied extensively in Madras, as Chennai was called then. Overnight, this mode of transport was replaced by cycle-rickshaws by forming a cooperative with the rickshaw-pullers as members. And this functions till today. If Chennai can do it so easily, then why cannot Calcutta? The chief minister has assured that alternative means of livelihood will be worked out for those affected. So there is still room for hope.

 Yours faithfully,

Kirit Shroff, Calcutta

 Sir ? The sudden decision to do away with hand-pulled rickshaws is not a very good idea. First, these rickshaws have been an integral part of Calcutta?s heritage, like Durga Puja or mishti doi. Therefore, a small number of hand-pulled rickshaws could be spared for plying near tourist destinations like the Victoria Memorial and Maidan. Second, no matter how much the government tries, it would be impossible to provide jobs for all the rickshaw-pullers rendered jobless, since most of them are illiterate and elderly. They might even find it difficult to drive comparatively more sophisticated vehicles such as auto-rickshaws on busy Calcutta streets. Third, auto and cycle-rickshaws are not good for the already-congested traffic scenario of the city. The government must take some time and think about the issue before coming to a final decision. Or it might turn out to be another historic blunder committed by the communists.

 Yours faithfully,

Soham Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? The sight of a man, most likely old and frail, pulling a rickshaw, laden with well-fed passengers and their luggage, with his bare hands cannot make for a pleasant sight. Which is why the decision to remove taana rickshaws is laudable. I only hope that the present chief minister succeeds where his predecessor failed in 1988. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee should also look into the plight of the mutias, who carry heavy goods (often several times their own weight) on their head or shoulders. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 Sir ? If Calcutta?s image is to be improved globally, then saying goodbye to hand-pulled rickshaws is a good way of going about it. In this age of rapid globalization, we must package our city so that it can be a strong contender to cities like Bangalore or Hyderabad as a global business centre. Abolishing taana rickshaws would also make most human rights activists happy. If adequately compensated, this would be a true Independence Day gift for the 24,000-odd rickshaw-pullers of the city.

 Yours faithfully,

Sujoy Hajra, North Brunswick, US

 Sir ? After reading the report relating to hand-pulled rickshaws, I am not sure whether to laud Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s decision or to condemn it. The most fitting decision, in my view, would be to allow the rickshaw to die a natural death, which was what the ruling government had once planned. However, banning hand-pulled rickshaws is welcome, provided that the quality of the lives of the rickshaw-pullers improve.

 Yours faithfully,

V. Krishnakumar, New Delhi

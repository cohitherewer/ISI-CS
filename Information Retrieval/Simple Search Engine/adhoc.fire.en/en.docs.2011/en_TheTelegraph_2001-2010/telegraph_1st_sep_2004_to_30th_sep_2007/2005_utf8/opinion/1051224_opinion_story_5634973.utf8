 Letters to Editor

 To every ailment, a reason

 Sir ? One cannot but be amused at how the reasons for chronic diseases vary from one country to another (?Brittle truth about bones?, Dec 5). In the West, the prime reason behind osteoporosis is said to be less exposure to sunlight, leading to the skin?s failure to manufacture Vitamin D. However, this obviously does not go for India, where there is an overdose of sunshine. Instead of beating about the bush and scaring us into taking expensive tests and medicines, why don?t the doctors admit that they have no clue as to why mankind is now faced with so many chronic diseases?

 Yours faithfully,

 Jagannath Chatterjee, Bhubaneswar

 Dirt in the campus

 Sir ? One of the most important tasks undertaken by the Supreme Court is to rid the campuses in the country of political parties, money games and hooliganism (?Tough nut for campus clean-up?, Dec 6). One fails to understand how a college student in his first or second year, yet to reach voting age, can be eligible for a political party?s membership, as well as to contest and vote in college elections. Many ?students? past their youth are found to be pursuing different courses in colleges, just to remain active in campus politics. 

 The aggressive students? unions should be replaced by friendly associations, to help healthy interaction with the college authorities and to help improve the standards of education and student facilities. The move by Kerala University to allow only toppers to stand for the elections, and restricting union activities to studies, arts, sports and music is welcome. Hopefully, our campuses will finally be rid of aimless politics and become places of learning again.

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

 Sir? The editorial, ?Work wise? (Dec 15), on student elections seems to mention the positive side of campus politics only as an afterthought. Having been the chairman of a college union myself, while representing a student organization in Kerala, I can assure you that a student coming out of college with some political background, is better equipped to take on the world than an ordinary student. Besides, this phenomenon in India prepares the students for a fruitful political career. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The disturbed college and university campuses desperately needed an order like the one issued by the Supreme Court. For years the lives and careers of students have been endangered by political intervention. This order will, in a big way, reduce the influence of major parties in the campus. The elections in our colleges and universities are tussles between political parties rather than students? bodies. Barring politically-affiliated bodies from contesting college elections will spare students from being dragged against their will into the murky world of campus politics. 

 Yours faithfully,

Abhrajit Chatterjee, Howrah

 Parting shot

 Sir? The way The Telegraph sympathetically presents the case of a young murderer?s father in ?My son, the murderer? (Dec 6), does not seem right. Dominick Waravale?s son may be dear to him, but the 16-month-old child his son killed must have been just as dear to his parents. These days, it has become quite common for parents of wayward boys and girls to drop names and defend their children, instead of hanging their heads in shame. Mumbai police deserve kudos for nabbing Ashish Waravale and his accomplice fast. As the statistical probability of such killers? reformation and repentance is low, there does not seem to be any point in letting them feed on public money. Law enforcers may think of introducing counselling for their parents.

 Yours faithfully,

Chameli Pal, Batanagar

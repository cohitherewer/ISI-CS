 NO INCENTIVE

 Yet another inter-ministerial committee to examine export incentives has been announced. There is always tension between the commerce and finance ministries on export incentives, since the latter believes revenue forgone through duty waivers is considerable. For instance, in 2004-05, there are estimates that more than Rs 40,000 crore of revenue was lost through duty waivers. How critical are export incentives to export success? One tends to equate duty concessions with import duty waivers and with duties dropping, especially on manufactured imports, these concessions are not significant. That apart, with services accounting for increased share of exports, Indian exports seem to be less price sensitive now and there is even some evidence of product differentiation, contributing to reduced price elasticity. However, duty concessions are not only on import duties. Exported goods, and even services, are also exempt from payment of domestic indirect taxes and these can be considerable. Unfortunately, service-sector taxation is not yet integrated into the value-added tax framework. The limited VAT represents unification of state sales tax alone, and even in this, there are non-VAT implementing states and rate variations among those that have implemented VAT. Other indirect taxes also remain. Once there is a revenue neutral goods and service tax, one suspects the rate will be closer to 20 per cent.

 This is a considerable price disadvantage, if exports are not exempted. World Trade Organization agreements permit such exemption. However, given India?s non-transparent indirect tax structure, it is difficult to precisely establish the domestic indirect tax rate. This makes Indian defence at anti-dumping or anti-subsidy investigations difficult. Legitimate export incentives (duty refunds) are interpreted as export subsidies and subjected to countervailing action. Until this is sorted out, no inter-ministerial committee can take major steps to introduce a system of WTO-compliant export incentives. All that will happen is some rationalization and unification along two streams ? first, schemes where import duties are not paid to start with (advance licences) and second, where duties are paid and then refunded. It will continue to be difficult to defend duty drawback or the duty-entitlement pass book in Geneva or elsewhere, because in the last resort, the rates are arbitrary. 

 But at least there will be some check on the commerce ministry announcing a plethora of export incentive schemes that are never implemented. Rationalized incentives will also result in fewer procedures. Complaints surface about India?s export procedures: the World Bank and International Finance Corporation?s recent ?Doing Business? report is an instance. However, there are few export procedures. The procedures are about claiming export incentives and there is an important difference between the two.

 TUG OF THE PAST

 There is no equivalent of a silver jubilee in the Hindu calendar. But the party of Hindutva, the Bharatiya Janata Party, cannot afford to ignore its 25th birthday today. The BJP was born as a reincarnation of the Bharatiya Jan Sangh. The choice of name was deliberate because through it the former members of the Jan Sangh made a deliberate gesture to associate themselves with the Janata Party. One of the implications of that gesture was the attempt to play down the Hindutva element in the party programme. The experiment was not altogether successful. Within ten years, inspired by Mr L.K.Advani?s ratha yatra, Hindutva re-emerged as the BJP?s unique selling point. It aroused the masses and brought electoral dividends. In this context, the demolition of the Babri Masjid ? carried out under the banner of Hindutva and under the aegis of a BJP government in Uttar Pradesh ? was not an unqualified blessing for the BJP. It took a campaign to its peak and left it with nowhere to go and, more importantly, it marked the BJP as a party not averse to promoting communal violence to secure political mileage. The BJP took lessons from this. When it came to power with Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee as prime minister, Hindutva slipped through the trapdoor of governance and coalition politics. On most crucial issues ? economic reforms being the most important one ? the BJP distanced itself from the rantings of the extreme elements within its own fold and within the sangh parivar, and proceeded to decide on issues of governance, often putting ideology on the back-burner. The passage to becoming a party of governance was not smooth. The BJP will have to live with the fact that one of its chief ministers presided over a pogrom against Muslims in Gujarat.

 On its silver jubilee, the BJP stands before a forked road. There is the road leading to its ideology and the other is the path to governance. It is obvious that the BJP leadership is not clear in its own mind about which road to take. There is the pressure, as the principal opposition party, to oppose everything the government does, including measures furthering good governance. Thus the party?s opposition to value-added tax. Mr Advani?s flip-flop between governance and ideology is only a sign of the prevailing confusion.

 The BJP has perhaps fallen into the grid that makes the history of political parties in India. Political parties emerge into prominence at the head of strong ideologically-driven movements: the Congress and the national movement, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in West Bengal and the BJP and Ram mandir. But once in power, these parties tend to shed their agitational features and then acquire new and more acceptable plumes. The Congress and the CPI(M) have made this transition with aplomb. The BJP is dragging its feet, but 25 years is less than a tick in the Hindutva clock.

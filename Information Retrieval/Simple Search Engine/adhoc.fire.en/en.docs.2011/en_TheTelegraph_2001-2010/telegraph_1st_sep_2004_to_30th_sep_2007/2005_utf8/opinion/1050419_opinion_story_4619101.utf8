 ALL THAT IS NOT IN ACTUAL CONTROL 

Until there is a left government at the Centre, India?s 

relations with China will continue to be dictated by US interests in the region, 

writes Achin Vanaik 

 Change of heart 

It is a measure of how far Indian politics has travelled 

that a Communist Party of India (Marxist) congress and the visit of the Chinese 

premier should be perceived as essentially unrelated events. Way back in 1964, 

when the unified Communist Party of India split, the CPI(M) was viewed with suspicion 

as the pro-China force that had refused to unequivocally support India in the 

context of the Sino-Indian border dispute and the war of 1962. Today, most Indian 

admirers of the 1991 neo-liberal turn in economic policy would prefer to berate 

the CPI(M) for not being sufficiently like the Chinese communist party. The standard 

refrain now is that India needs to emulate China in encouraging economic globalization 

and foreign direct investment inflows as the magic wand that can transform India 

into an economic super- power.

This completely misreads the Chinese economic experience, 

though it certainly provides self-serving justifications for India?s neo-liberal 

trajectory. The Chinese ?success story? (it has grossly underestimated failures 

and weaknesses) owes nothing to neo-liberalism and everything to the following 

elements. One, the fundamental transformations carried out as part of its communist 

past, that is, truly comprehensive land reform and sustained campaigns to eliminate 

mass illiteracy and establishment of a remarkably widespread public health infrastructure 

that is now being steadily undermined. Two, an initial emphasis, in the mid-Seventies 

and the mid-Eighties, on raising agricultural production and incomes ? the ?household 

responsibility system?. 

Three, an industrial policy aimed at directing foreign 

capital towards export production and ensuring technology transfer. Also, promotion 

of domestic backward linkages in the supply of manufacturing inputs while allowing 

minority shareholdings for outsiders. This was a way of disciplining business 

while the state maintained overall control over the direction of investments. 

Four, disciplining labour ? supplying cheap labour, working incredibly long hours, 

while denying them basic democratic workplace rights. 

Even as this Chinese trajectory was assuredly capitalist, 

it was anything but neo-liberal, except in its attitude towards workers? rights. 

If the Indian right and centre are mistaken in interpreting the ?success? of this 

experience as a validation of their own neo-liberal orientation, the CPI(M) (and 

CPI) are simply deluding themselves if they think China is socialist in anything 

but name.

But do the Chinese premier?s visit and the generational 

change in CPI(M) leadership represent important new possibilities, especially 

with respect to Sino-Indian relations? A crucial political-psychological breakthrough 

has clearly been made on the Indian side. For more than two decades, if not longer, 

it has been evident that the only feasible way the border dispute could be finally 

settled was for India to accept the fait accompli of the 1962 war. China 

had got most of what it wanted and any final settlement would now have to be based 

on give-and-take along the existing line of actual control. Chinese claims and 

attitudes towards Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim were always only bargaining counters 

to be given up, provided India accepted that most of Aksai Chin should rest de 

jure, and not just de facto, with China. Dress it up whatever way you 

like, a final settlement would require legitimizing basic concessions by India, 

not China.

The Sino-Indian conflict is one that needn?t ever 

have taken place. China always had a reasonable case that should have been recognized 

but wasn?t. So what has changed to make such a final settlement not just possible 

but likely, now that basic political parameters for resolving the conflict have 

been spelt out? Above all else, it is the simple passage of time, not sudden statesmanship 

by the Bharatiya Janata Party-led previous government or by the current Congress-led 

one. India cannot get by force what it earlier lost on the ground. After 40 odd 

years, elite passions in India have died down over what for the most part is uninhabited 

and remote. Elite pride in India can now be assuaged by other insignias of self-importance 

such as the illusions of power provided by the bomb and second-class membership 

status in a revamped security council. Only that small minority within the so-called 

strategic community that has always insisted that China is a strategic opponent 

and must be treated as such, might feel disappointed at the turn of events.

But a final border settlement will not dramatically 

alter Sino-India relations. These will remain somewhat wary albeit more relaxed. 

This is because the crucial determinant of the future evolution of Sino-Indian 

relations is the United States of America, which both the Chinese and Indian elites 

are desperate not to offend. The Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, made this very clear 

when talking about developing better Russia-China-India ties. This is not subterfuge. 

It is the US that calls the shots and the dominant classes of every other aspiring 

major power are firmly on the defensive with regard to it. They are not just structurally 

locked into a globalizing capitalist order, for whose stability the US government 

remains the chief guardian, but they are ideologically awed by the model of power 

and prosperity that the US is supposed to represent. In China and India (as also 

Russia), elite interests and values both converge, pushing towards befriending 

and emulating the US.

If China, India and Russia ever move towards a strategic 

alliance directed against the US, it will only be as the outcome of unexpected 

developments. Either American power will have been decisively and considerably 

weakened in the coming decades because of imperial overstretch ? an overstretch 

that will owe little or nothing to the pusillanimous behaviour of these three 

countries. (Such a US decline will make the risks of establishing countervailing 

alliances much less, and the benefits much greater.) Or the US will prove to be 

so inept and arrogant in its behaviour towards all the three countries that it 

literally forces these otherwise reluctant elites to join up against it.

In the US-China-India triangle it is the Sino-US relationship 

that is paramount and it is the direction that this takes that will most shape 

the Indo-US and Sino-Indian relationships. The current US policy towards China 

reflects and combines two attitudes. One recognizes the value ? economic and political 

? of making China a strategic partner. The other recognizes China?s potential 

as a future strategic rival. Today, and for a considerable time to come, US policy 

will be motivated by, and expressive of, both these attitudes. There is no such 

ambiguity in the Indo-US relationship. As long as either a BJP-led or a Congress-led 

government is in power, India will interpret or adjust its ?national interests? 

in accordance with US strategic needs in the region, or at worst not put up serious 

resistance to US perspectives it may be unhappy about. Only a left-led government 

at the Centre would change this.

But to challenge the BJP and Congress, the CPI(M), 

as its new general secretary publicly acknowledges, must make a strategic breakthrough 

in the Hindi heartland ? something it still does not know how to do. Traditionally, 

an ideologically disciplined cadre-based party pursues extra parliamentary politics 

even as it operates within parliament. This is a high-potential yet high-risk 

strategy that will polarize north Indian politics even as it can promise substantial 

partisan gains. The CPI(M) is not that kind of a party. So can it grow in some 

other way? 

For two decades, north Indian politics has been dominated 

by lower caste assertion. To successfully hitch onto the dynamics, the CPI(M) 

must change its own caste profile by providing leadership access to Dalits and 

most backward classes through proportional representation of such groups in all 

leadership bodies. On its own this will not provide that strategic breakthrough 

but it will mark a significant step forward. It is the kind of low fuss, high 

impact measure that is worth trying by both the CPI(M) and the CPI. What have 

they got to lose?

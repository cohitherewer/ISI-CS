 DAMAGE CONTROL

 There are some odours which cannot be removed, as Lady Macbeth knew, with the help of all the perfumes of Arabia. The efforts made by the Congress leadership to undo the wrong done in Jharkhand may be one of those thankless enterprises. The leadership of the Congress may find it extremely difficult to disown the dubious attempt to make Mr Shibu Soren the chief minister of Jharkhand without the adequate backing of numbers. What followed was one of the most unseemly chapters in the unedifying annals of contemporary Indian politics. The responsibility for scripting this chapter might lie with some backroom politicians of the Congress but the buck, as the saying goes, stops at the top. It was thus that the image and the credibility of the prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, and that of the Congress president, Ms Sonia Gandhi, suffered serious damage. Mr Singh?s name has become practically synonymous with political rectitude in India. Ms Gandhi had set new standards of political morality when she had refused the prime ministership. The decision to ask Mr Soren to resign redeems Mr Singh?s and Ms Gandhi?s positions, but only partially so.

 Most observers find it difficult to believe that Ms Gandhi and Mr Singh were unaware of the plot to make Mr Soren the chief minister. For one thing, no one in the Congress is powerful and influential enough to take such a critical decision behind the back of Ms Gandhi. And Ms Gandhi has no secrets from Mr Singh. The issue of responsibility lies elsewhere. It is located in the political genes of the Congress. The Congress, whenever it has been in power, has used the office of the governor politically and to its own advantage. Other political parties have done the same when they have been at the helm of the political machine. But the Congress, when it was India?s number one party, cast the first stone. Despite protestations to the contrary in the Jharkhand affair, the Congress was pulled back by its genes. In allowing itself to be dominated by its regressive genes, the Congress leadership ignored the fact that the context of politics in India has radically altered from the time when Indira Gandhi ruled the roost.

 The Congress has wiped the egg from its face following Mr Soren?s resignation and the appointment of Mr Arjun Munda of the National Democratic Alliance as the chief minister by the governor, Mr Syed Sibtey Razi. This has set the scene for a proper test of majority in the legislative assembly. Both the Congress and the NDA can now play the numbers game. It would appear from a simple narrative of events that the change in the Congress strategy in Jharkhand has been at the behest of the prime minister. If such a reading is correct then Mr Singh can claim to have recovered his moral high ground from a seemingly losing position. Mr Singh will be justified if he feels lonely on the high ground. The play of politics remains bereft of morality.

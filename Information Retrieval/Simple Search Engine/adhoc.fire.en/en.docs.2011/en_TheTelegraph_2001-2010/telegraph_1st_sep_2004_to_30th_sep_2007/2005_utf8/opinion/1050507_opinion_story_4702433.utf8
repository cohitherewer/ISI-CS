 Letters to Editor

 Whose interest is it anyway?

 Sir ? Deb Mukharji, in ?Self-interest and after? (May5), says that ?India had agreed to resume arms supplies [to Nepal]... in return for assurances that the regime would permit Nepal to return to the path of democracy?. May I ask a simple question: why should India have such a high stake in restoring democracy in Nepal, when many of our neighbours ? Pakistan, Myanmar, China ? have little or nothing of it? Perhaps they are tough nuts to crack, so we shower our Big Brotherly attention on Gyanendra. But what is the harm if we have one more autocratic neighbour?

 Yours faithfully,

 Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Wear and tear

 Sir ? It is not unusual for social and religious groups to have prescribed dress codes for men and women. Neither is it uncommon for people to adhere to such dress codes. However, if one?s profession requires him to follow a different dress code, then he must do so during the time that he spends in his professional space. When a teacher of a girls? school in Berhampore was forbidden to come to school in the traditional Muslim burqa, the administration was doing the right thing (?School trips teacher in burqa?, May 3). To give in to one such demand from a teacher would be to leave the door open for other teachers and students to make similar demands. If the idea is to cover the body and a part of whole of the head in public, then the sari can serve the purpose almost as well as the burqa. Has the teacher in question thought about the obvious hostility she would face from her colleagues ? who may be wearing saris under duress themselves ? if her demand is met?

 Special treatment is permissible in schools on certain grounds ? for instance if a teacher or a student is physically or mentally challenged. 

 Yours faithfully,

Rimli Datta, Calcutta

 Sir ? The attire of women teachers in West Bengal?s schools has been at the centre of controversies for some time. In the latest episode, the English teacher of Amtala Annadamani Girls? High school wished to wear the burqa instead of the mandatory sari. The school authorities turned out to be as rigid in their stand as Susmita Mondal herself. This has opened up once more the debate on the role of the teacher. How can a teacher?s attire be more important than the quality of her teaching and her ability to impart the right kind of education to the students? Since Mondal?s demand does not amount to a violation of any rule of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education, it is only right that she has been allowed to resume her duties in a burqa.

 Yours faithfully,

Koyel Basu, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is good that Susmita Mondal defied the diktat of her seniors and attended school wearing a burqa (?Teacher defies tradition sermon?, May 5). Dictating what a person might wear is intruding into his personal freedom. But when it comes to the professional realm, a dress code is usually imposed with good reason. Sometimes, as in the case of a Calcutta college some years ago, such codes come without any logical reason.

 In the case under discussion, we are talking of an all-women institution, where the wearing of a burqa cannot possibly have any serious or useful purpose except tom-tomming one?s identity as a member of a particular religious community. But Mondal is in the school as a teacher, and her religious and professional identities ought to be mutually exclusive. Moreover, as a recent convert to Islam, she cannot claim either that she has become accustomed to wearing a burqa from her childhood. 

 Thanks to the intervention from the secondary board, the controversy did not gather momentum and embroil students and guardians in it. 

 Yours faithfully,

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta

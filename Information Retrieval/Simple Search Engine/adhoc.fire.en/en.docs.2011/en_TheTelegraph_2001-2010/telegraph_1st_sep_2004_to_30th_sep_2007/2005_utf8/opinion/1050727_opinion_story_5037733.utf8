 TO CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE 

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the communique issued by the G8 nations at Gleneagles, July 8

 Tackling climate change and promoting clean technologies, while pursuing energy security and sustainable development, will require a global concerted effort over a sustained period.

 9. We therefore agree to take forward a dialogue on climate change, clean energy and sustainable development, and invite other interested countries with significant energy needs to join us. We will:

 (a) address the strategic challenge of transforming our energy systems to create a more secure and sustainable future;

 (b) monitor implementation of the commitments made in the Gleneagles Plan of Action and explore how to build on this progress; and

 (c) share best practice between participating governments.

 10. We will ask our governments to take the dialogue forward... 

 11. We will work with appropriate partnerships, institutions and initiatives including the International Energy Agency and World Bank:

 (a) the IEA will advise on alternative energy scenarios and strategies aimed at a clean, clever and competitive energy future.

 (b) The World Bank will take a leadership role in creating a new framework for clean energy and development, including investment in financing.

 12. Following the success of the Energy and Environment Ministerial Roundtable held in London in March, the UK will hold meetings to take the dialogue forward in the second half of this year...

 13. We welcome the Russian decision to focus on energy in its Presidency of the G8 in 2006 and the programme of meetings Russia plans to hold.

 14. We acknowledge that the UNFCCC is the appropriate forum for negotiating future action on climate change. Those of us who have ratified the Kyoto Protocol welcome its entry into force and will work to make it a success.

 15. We will work together to advance the goals and objective we have agreed today to inform the work of the UN Climate Change Conference in Montreal 2005. We are committed to move forward in that forum the global discussion on long-term cooperative action to address climate change...

 Africa: A historic opportunity

 This is a moment of opportunity for Africa. Its leaders have embraced a new vision for the continent?s future which recognizes their leading role in addressing the continent?s challenges and realizing its opportunities.

 There are now just ten years in which to take the action needed for all developing countries to meet the goals agreed at the Millennium Summit in 2000. We should continue the G8 focus on Africa, which is the only continent not on track to meet any of the goals of the Millennium Declaration by 2015.

 Important progress has been made. In the past five years, more than two thirds of sub-Saharan African countries have had democratic elections. Inflation is a fifth of levels a decade ago...

 Letters to Editor

 The bark is worse than the bite

 Sir ? Bengalis had better be prepared for more such ?Eleven hours of darkness? (Oct 5) in the future, with Madam Karat, in her expensive handloom saris, articulating the hurt feelings of the toiling ?public? on prime-time television; and Gurudas Dasgupta holding forth on the ?insensitivity? of the rich. Though trains ran in Prakash Karat?s Kerala, Subhas Chakraborty rightly pointed out that strikes translated into bandhs, held so frequently, have lost their bite. Sitaram Yechury will agree that the left barks more than it bites.

 Yours faithfully,

Manjira Majumdar, Calcutta

 Festive fervour 

 Sir ? As in previous years, this year too a number of big-ticket puja pandals will have peculiar idols ? Durga looking like an Egyptian or a Roman goddess, or divested of weapons to emphasize that she symbolizes peace (then why not stop shakti aradhana totally?). The organizers, whose real objective is to attract attention or to win a few prizes, seek the indulgence of the traditionalists by trying to pass them off as art. Artists have every right to creative freedom, but they have art galleries and other forums to display their handiwork. Fortunately, most Calcuttans appear to favour the traditional format. There is need to monitor such representations of the goddess. But unless people express their discontent over such ?theme pujas?, there will always be some to dump rubbish on them.

 Yours faithfully,

Partho Roy, Calcutta

 Sir ? Pandals made of foodstuff expose the insensitivity of puja organizers to the millions of poor in our country and to the victims of natural calamities who do not have food to eat. Are we so prosperous that we can waste food like this? Wouldn?t the goddess have been happier if the organizers had donated the foodstuff to them?

 Yours faithfully,

Soham Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? The report, ?Puja set aside to give patient a chance? (Oct 2), touches on a subject that is very relevant today ?the waste of money during the pujas. It is a shame that the government allows puja committees to spend so much. The Nilkuthi Sarbojonin Durgotsav Committee thus sets a good example by calling off the celebrations to save a boy. Why cannot we set aside a small sum from the lakhs that go into pandals and lighting for the people of Malda who lose their land and homes to the Ganga each year, and to whom the government promises to provide rehabilitation, but never actually does? 

 Yours faithfully,

Shalini Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? Many artisans earn their livelihood by crafting the expensive idols, lighting and pandals, so it may not make sense to do away with them altogether. But surely we can cut down on costs without harming the craftsmen? 

 Yours faithfully,

Rohini Karmakar, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is a novel decision on the part of the authorities to charge fees from Durga Puja organizers for immersion of idols in the Hoogly river. The pollution of the river must be checked, and the authorities should use the funds generated to clean the river-bed, so that its navigability can be maintained and aquatic life preserved.

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Sir ? Amidst the glitz and glamour of the big-ticket community pujas, it is good to see the few old-world pujas. Take the one in the Sovabazar Rajbari and those in a few aristocratic family homes, which still maintain strict standards of piety, dignity and tradition.

 Yours faithfully,

Pramit Das, Jamshedpur

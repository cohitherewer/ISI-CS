 INNATELY SILLY

 The president of Harvard University, Mr Lawrence Summers, is a bit of a silly man. He forgot who he was. His suggestion, that ?innate differences? between the sexes prevent women from succeeding at the highest levels in mathematics and science, is an entirely unexceptionable one. Far from the luminous precincts of the temple of Western learning, in the dimly-lit rooms of numerous respectable, perfectly sensible-sounding Indians, the selfsame sentiments are expressed daily, with little attendant fuss. Their girls are ?streamed off? into the humanities, where they are expected to do better than they would in the sciences, and cost less as well. Talk about ?innate differences? ? the mill-hand and the miner, the soccer fanatic and the gynaecologist, could all have taught Mr Summers a thing or two. But Mr Summers, perhaps out of a long habit of self-importance ? being a brilliant economist, professor and public man ? suffered, at least momentarily, from a special kind of amnesia. He was speaking at an economic conference, and although he was not there as Harvard University president, he should not have forgotten he was that too. For him to make a casual suggestion that the ?difference in performance? between the sexes need not be owing to social factors as people ?prefer to believe? was egregiously silly. Offending the brilliant women in the university he heads and discour- aging more from joining it are hardly signs of presidential tact. Uneconomical too.

 In itself, though, the suggestion is particularly unoriginal, and singularly without the touch of Mr Summers?s famed intellectual splendour. It is banal. Women?s tragedy all over the world is that activists have to spend half their energies fighting precisely this kind of bludgeon-like banality that most men believe to be the ordering principle of the universe. Mr Summers has gone into a profusely apologetic mode since his unfortunate moment of amnesia: he has issued three apologies in as many days. His comments matter. The respectable Indian parents, who discriminate between their children?s intellectual capabilities on the basis of sex, have no one except their unimportant daughters to answer to. They are also making a mistake about how ?easy? the higher levels of the humanities are. They are actually deciding on two different achievement levels for their sons and daughters respectively when they practise such gender-based ?streaming?. The prejudice is so hackneyed that there is little left to be said. The whole world knows that the playing field between the sexes is not a level one. The causes of unevenness are many, but the grey cells are not one of them.

 But grant the man his prejudice. The academia is the ideal place where unpleasant and unacceptable thoughts can be aired and argued out. Taking offence is hardly an intellectual response either. But perhaps Mr Summers should not have been the one to put it to the test.

 Letters to Editor

 Sole exception

 Sir ? May 8 was celebrated as Victory Day ? the day in 1945 on which the biggest war of the 20th century officially came to an end ? by all the countries of the world that took part in World War II. The sole exception was India, which failed to honour its soldiers who died in that war. We still perceive World War II to be a ?British war?, fought by the Brits through the Indian army. The fact that India had 250,000 men in the battlefield, suffered 106,845 casualties, and won 31 Victoria Crosses, 131 Military Crosses, 4 George Crosses, 252 Distinguished Service Orders and 347 Indian Orders of Merit, the highest percentage of awards won by any Commonwealth country, did not rouse even the slightest emotion in our government and civil society.

 Yours faithfully,

 N.B. Grant, Pune

 No booming guns

 Sir ? In ?Tata ore gun booms at Mittal? in the May 12 edition of The Telegraph (?Tata vs Mittal in ore scramble? in the North and South Bengal and Guwahati editions of the same day), the newspaper?s correspondents have quoted Mr B. Muthuraman, managing director, Tata Steel, out of context to sensationalize the report. Mr Muthuraman spoke on various ambitious plans of Tata Steel, but the correspondents focussed only on certain comments and created sensational and controversial news. Further, the headline of the report gives the impression of a battle between the Tatas and the Mittals. The accompanying photographs of Mr Ratan Tata and Mr L.N. Mittal further emphasize this impression and are uncalled for. 

 Mr Muthuraman did not even once name Mr Mittal in his speech and reference to Mittal Steel came with other steel companies planning to set up plants in Jharkhand. Mr Muthuraman had appealed to the chief minister of Jharkhand that while selecting an investor, the government should take care of the interest of the state. In this context, he informed the audience about the Corporate Social Responsibility work done by Tata Steel in the last 98 years. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sanjay Choudhry,

 VAT?s up?

 Sir ? Abhirup Sarkar?s ?Confused values? (May 11), is enlightening. But his sweeping remark ? ?traders in general hate to pay taxes and the new system is threatening them to do exactly that? ? cannot be accepted. Surely, Sarkar is not so na?ve as to think that sales tax is paid by the traders. The term ?sales tax?, in fact, is a misnomer since the seller does not pay sales tax. On the contrary, it is the buyer who pays tax for purchasing a commodity. The seller only collects the tax on behalf of the commercial tax department from the purchaser and deposits it with the government. He gets a rebate for this. 

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? If there is a solution for every problem, the converse is also true. The motivated campaign against VAT is proof enough. Haryana ? the first and the only state to adopt VAT last year ? speaks volumes of how it helps the economy. Despite the fact that the state?s administration is second to none in corruption, revenue collection shot up from Rs 3,346 crore in 2003-04 to Rs 4,778 crore last year.

 India?s fiscal levies are amongst the highest in the world, adversely affecting its GDP growth. It is good that the empowered committee is persevering in its efforts to iron out aberrations in the administration of VAT, including its rates and refund. The maximum retail price, a legacy of the scarcity era, needs reform. In the buyers? market today, the MRP is useful only as a price guidance. Using it as the basis for calculating VAT liability makes no sense. Further, if the difference in rates makes the VAT paid by a dealer on his purchase more than the VAT charged by him ? which in fact is the main grouse of chemists and druggists ? such excess tax should be refunded. The Centre should make it clear that its offer to states to compensate any revenue loss for switching over to VAT is time bound and is not available to those which do not switch over to VAT within the next three months.

 Yours faithfully,

N. Narasimhan, Bangalore

 Sir ? The virulent opposition of the retailer or wholeseller nexus to VAT is understandable. As Abhirup Sarkar notes, most traders try not to issue proper cash memos, often forcing buyers to opt for the tax free memo. So nobody pays any tax on the purchases. VAT is likely to reduce the generation of black money and encourage transactions through the banking sector. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sujoy Kumar, Calcutta

 Sir ? The much-hyped VAT regime was supposed to bring uniformity to the tax structure throughout the country. But Orissa has definite reasons to feel deprived, so far as revenue collection is concerned. Lower tax rates in neighbouring states like West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh are certain to divert local traders? attention to these ready markets. The matter is alarming since it involves even commodities of daily use, especially foodgrains. But it would still be improper to blame the United Progressive Alliance government for all the discrepancies and loopholes that exist in the system. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Letters to Editor

 Brand equity

 Sir ? Netaji is a good brand, particularly in this part of India. While some politicians admit their errors in assessment, some claim to be the sole upholders of his ideology, and some others flaunt their lineage. Even the anti-establishment filmmakers of the Seventies have now joined the bandwagon to rake in some money. So, when Krishna Bose makes a trip to get back to media focus, riding piggyback on Subhas Chandra Bose, it raises no eyebrows (?In Netaji steps, with guide son?, May 4). Bose wanted to bring the Japanese, with their dismal human rights record, to India. As colonial rulers, the Japanese were far worse than the British, and no one is so na?ve as to believe that once in, they would leave India graciously. God and the British Indian army, in that order, saved India from the catastrophe. Recently, Japan made an unusual public apology for its wartime excesses in front of world leaders. They have the courage and political honesty to own up to their mistakes and learn from them. We, alas, do not.

 Yours faithfully,

 Paul Francis Tapno, Calcutta

 Power games

 Sir ? There are no free lunches, or so the saying goes. But the Maharashtra government made a pre-election promise of giving free power to its farmers (?Free power feels shock?, May 11). Most things, especially amenities such as electricity, are better not distributed free of cost, since free distribution leads to misuse. In Maharashtra?s case, it caused a shortfall in the industrial and urban areas. And none of this was the fault of the farmers, but of the politicians who promised free power to win elections. They pleaded with the Centre and the neighbouring states for additional power. The Centre finally agreed, on the condition of rolling back free power to farmers. But even after the rollback, misuse of power will be impossible to check. The Maharashtra government has decided to charge a fixed amount on the basis of the horsepower of the pumps in use. This means that the farmers can consume power endlessly by paying a fixed amount. But the farmers must pay for what they use. Even when it is an essential amenity like electricity.

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

 Sir ? After coming to power riding on the promise of free electricity, the rollback of the promise amounts to a serious breach of trust. Promising free power, regularizing slums up to convenient cut-off dates, additions to the OBC lists are the usual games our politicians play on the eve of elections. It is time that the Election Commission intervened and imposed a ban on gimmicks like India shining, free power, free meals, rice at two rupees, communal reservations and so on a fair period ahead of the elections. It would be to the greater benefit of the farmers if they are ensured a fair price for their produce rather than sops like free power, which are going to be retracted sooner or later.

 Yours faithfully,

Raghubir Singh, Pune

 Lessons not learnt

 Sir ? In his review of my book, Economic Reforms: The Indian Experience, Satrujit Banerjee has made a few comments, which I feel I need to respond to (?Let the good times roll on?, April 15). First, he says: ?Saksena takes data from 1984-85 to 1991-92 for the pre-reforms era, while the data from 1994-95 to 2000-01 represent the reforms period.? Other than the first chapter, ?Overview?, the data relate mostly to two ten-year periods ? 1981-82 to 1990-91, preceding the crisis year, 1991-92, and 1992-93 to 2001-02, or the reforms period.

 Second, I do not ?recommend? any of the things that the reviewer mentions ? such as ?broad-basing the ownership and management of PSUs by selling government equity to the general public or the workers, or making ?strategic sales? of PSUs on a selective basis?. These are steps taken by the government towards privatization. My recommendations are clearly mentioned in the book: The PSUs need to be ?fully exposed to competition by withdrawal of all government protection and patronage?. It is also important to have independent regulators to ensure a level playing field, and to prevent and punish unfair practices. All constituents of the public sector must be studied and appropriate measures adopted to set things on the right track.

 Third, it is not true that I find ?China...so far ahead in every field that no real lessons can be learnt here?. In fact, based on the available data about the relative performance of the Indian and Chinese scenarios, I have even listed the lessons India can learn from China ? such as eliminating dissavings in the public sector and curbing conspicuous private consumption to raise domestic savings; supporting new capacity-creating, export-oriented foreign investment; encouraging agriculture and land reforms; enabling industrial establishments to expand and become global players; encouraging exports, particularly of value-added light manufactured goods; formulating a simple, flexible labour policy, effectively controlling population growth, as China has done; and allocating larger resources for expanding basic health and education facilities and reducing poverty and social inequalities.

 Yours faithfully,

K.D. Saksena, Bhopal

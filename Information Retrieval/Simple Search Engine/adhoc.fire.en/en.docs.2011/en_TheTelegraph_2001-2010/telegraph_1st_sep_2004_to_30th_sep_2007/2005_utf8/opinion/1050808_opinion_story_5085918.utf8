 OUT OF THE CLASS

 There are various ways of giving up on flogging a dead horse. Lifting the ban on private practice for doctors teaching in state-run hospitals is one way of admitting that nothing more could be done to these hospitals to turn them into attractive workplaces for these doctors. These hospitals will continue to be hopeless, hellish places ? for teaching, research as well as medical practice ? so the state might as well legalize what goes on illegally anyway, and thereby reduce corruption and indiscipline. A bill has been tabled in West Bengal towards lifting the 1990 ban, and if it is carried through, then the health minister hopes that the quality of medical education would improve in West Bengal. At the moment, only three of the nine medical colleges are post-graduate institutions, and out of about 3,000 posts for teaching doctors, almost 200 are vacant. If this situation does not improve, then some of these teaching hospitals run the risk of being derecognized by the Medical Council of India. So doctors ? apart from those in important administrative positions ? will be allowed the option of practising privately if they do not go in for the non-practising allowance.At present, many doctors avail themselves, corruptly, of both options.

 This bill would be welcomed by most good and law-abiding doctors in the state, many of whom found it impossible to remain confined to these hospitals, and, unable to choose the corrupt option, had left their government jobs for private practice. So the system did lose valuable people. But if these hospitals continue to be what they are, and if their teaching staff are given the choice of carrying on parallel careers, then the chances of their being conscientious about their hospital duties in this thoroughly bleak, mismanaged and irregular scenario in the government hospitals are quite remote. Given the chance, most doctors would behave like the staff of Suri Sadar Hospital, where there was only one doctor recently, out of forty employed by the hospital, to attend to a huge number of injured and dead brought in after a road accident. The chief minister has urged those who can afford them to use private nursing homes, leaving government hospitals for the poor. After systematically ruining the healthcare and medical education system in the state, it is typical of the government to plan damage-control sops that would leave none but the poor more helpless.

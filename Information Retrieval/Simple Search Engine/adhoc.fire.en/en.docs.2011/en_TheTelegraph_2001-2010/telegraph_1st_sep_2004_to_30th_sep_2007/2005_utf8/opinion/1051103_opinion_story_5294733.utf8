 DARKNESS IN THE EAST

 China has held its own amidst Western economic pressure, but failed to correct imbalances within its own society, writes Sunanda Sen

 Money for nothing

 The revaluation of the Chinese yuan by 2.2 per cent against the US dollar, announced on July 21, brings to an end the decade-long dollar exchange rate regime by replacing it with a trade weighted four currency basket. The latter includes, in addition to euro, yen and the dollar, the currency of Korea which is currently the second largest provider of imports and fourth largest destination of exports for China. 

 Defying repeated pressures from the US state department for a substantial revaluation to correct the current $152 billion US trade deficit with China and the recent recommendations by the European Union to introduce a currency basket which includes the pound, China has chosen to adjust its currency in a manner which suits it. 

 Finance has always been subject to state authority in China, even after the 1979 reforms. The state has so far been effective in restraining the advances of speculatory finance in China while steering the flow of capital along productive channels. The outcome has been to the interest of industrial capital, both domestic and foreign, with speculatory capital having less space than could be expected in the otherwise booming Chinese economy.

 Examples of tight control on the financial sector include the industry-oriented operation of China?s banks, having a very small margin of non-banking sources of income. State-controlled enterprises in China rely more on banks than on the stock market for finance. Foreign-controlled banks in the country are subject to a large number of restrictions which include a ban on their yuan operations, preventing speculation on Chinese currency. The state council provides a guide-book to banks, directing the allocation of credit towards ventures which have industrial potential. In December 2003, $45 billion was extracted out of China?s large exchange reserves. This rescued two major state-owned banks by eliminating their non-performing assets against bad loans .

 As for China?s stock market, only one-third of the shares are tradeable in the exchanges while foreign firms can register in the market only as joint ventures and cannot own beyond 20 per cent of shares in a company. The modest flow of equities to the country reflects the primitive state of the stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shengen. Small and medium enterprises cannot access the market, reducing the demand for stocks in the market. Banks cannot float shares in the stock market without prior approval, and there exists, in addition, a complete segregation of supervisory functions relating to banking, securities and insurance.

 The finances behind the industrial boom in the country are largely provided by banks and foreign direct investment and not by the stock market. Of the massive FDI inflows, a major part is contributed by the non-resident Chinese entrepreneurs in Asia. The surge of FDI inflows to China can be explained by the low wage rate (one-third of Mexico and one-fifteenth of the US), 84.5 per cent literacy rate of the population above 15 years, disciplining of the labour market, a stable exchange rate in dollars, favourable investment climate with infrastructural facilities and tax incentives for foreign enterprises, and finally, China?s success in managing a ?guided financial market?. 

 However, the current outflow of overseas porfolio investments by the Chinese had been around $13 billion along with a large negative balance of errors and omissions. With its large official reserves invested in US treasury bonds and the portfolio investments abroad by the residents, China in effect is investing substantial sums abroad, an aspect which remains inconsistent with the otherwise favourable investment climate within the country. One is left wondering if this is related to the untamed course of global finance!

 Success, in gearing finance to industry to achieve record growth in GDP, is hardly in step with the failure of China?s state capitalism to redress the growing inequalities in the country. Apart from the neglect of traditional agriculture, large disparities exist between per capita incomes of rural and urban areas. At least 80 billion or more Chinese have no permanent resident status in urban areas or even personal ID cards. Social security for the poor, both in rural and urban areas, is unheard of, a far cry from the socialist ideals of the pre-reform years. 

 The Chinese economy today is a model to discuss. The success of China?s state capitalism in bringing finance to industry , in avoiding the risk hazards of footloose mobile capital and above all, in entering the global market on its own terms should not make us forget its policy failures to address issues of internal distribution and popular discontent. One could easily recall the Brazilian miracle or the ?Shining India?. China today is caught in the trap of growth sans development. Quite an incredible outcome of its socialist legacies.

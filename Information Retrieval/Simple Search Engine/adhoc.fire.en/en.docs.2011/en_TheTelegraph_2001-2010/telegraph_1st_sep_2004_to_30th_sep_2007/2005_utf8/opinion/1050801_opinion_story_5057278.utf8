 ART AND NATURE

 The least a museum of the arts is expected to do is to protect its object from the weather. Yet that is precisely where Bharat Bhavan failed rather spectacularly when it rained heavily in Bhopal earlier this month. Bharat Bhavan is a pioneering ?multi-arts? complex, designed by the architect, Charles Correa, for the performing and the visual arts. Yet the entire concept of stylishly ?showcasing? the contemporary arts (fine as well as folk) of India seems to have overlooked the importance of the actual material care of the art objects. Preservation is a central aspect of modern museology, and it is a great deal more than a love for beautiful things and a stylish building. It involves the mastery of a full-fledged modern technology, in which protecting paintings from irregularities of temperature and moisture is the very basic. Hence hundreds of irreplaceable prints, paintings and other objects have got thoroughly wet, even drenched, and the museum has congratulated itself on the promptness of the first aid provided to these casualties. The paintings were being dried under ceiling fans, and some of them have been treated with breadcrumbs, which apparently help in soaking up the moisture. The museum authorities are now publicly talking about who might be held responsible for this drenching ? the architect or the management. There seems to be a general cluelessness about up-to-date preservation technology, and the need to think about upgrading the museum in this respect.

 The director of Bharat Bhavan is an IPS officer, and it is perhaps not fair to expect awareness regarding state-of-the art museology from him, although this is unfortunate for the artists who have trusted the museum with their work. Priceless paintings by Rabindranath Tagore and other Bengal School painters are perishing in the same way in the care of their official custodians. Indian attitudes to art are yet to incorporate properly the modern skills of preservation, restoration and curating. Unless this happens, it will be difficult to preserve India?s artistic heritage by purely cosmetic or bureaucratic means.

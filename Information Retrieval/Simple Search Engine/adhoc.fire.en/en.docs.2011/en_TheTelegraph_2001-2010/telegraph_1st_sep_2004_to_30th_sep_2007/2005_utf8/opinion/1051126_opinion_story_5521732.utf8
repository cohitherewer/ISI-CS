 DEATHLY QUIET

 There are some secrets that everybody knows. And everybody connives at pretending ignorance. The World Health Organization has produced a study entitled ?Women?s Health and Domestic Violence Against Women?, which makes clear that ?every 18 seconds, somewhere, a woman suffers violence or maltreatment?. The result of interviews with 24,000 women in 10 countries also shows that women are hurt and mistreated more by people at home than by strangers outside. This fact alone is enough to explode the myth of ignorance, for no one can be unaware of what goes on in the home. The focus of the study is the link between women?s health and the violence they face. Physically and sexually abused women suffer from long-term health damage including depression and a suicidal mentality.

 But the scale of the suffering is a harsh, inescapable fact by itself, and the 2005 report reinforces the findings of one in 2002 called ?World Report on Violence and Health?. Nothing has changed since then, and nothing ? or very little ?has changed for a very long time. Reports, analyses, workshops, shelters, laws, gender awareness programmes, self-help training programmes and so on have multiplied; violence against women is now part of the discourse of concern. That is, it would seem, the measure of change, and even that has been achieved painfully over the years by the determination and faith of activists. It is no wonder, therefore, that the coordinator of the study has expressed astonishment at the degree to which the violence remains hidden. 

 This conspiracy of silence has to be addressed as a separate issue. It is not just men, but women too, who refuse to speak of the torture they undergo. It would seem that a certain quality of life has been denied them for so many generations that they fail to recognize violence and injustice as unacceptable. Insecurity is built into their existence. This is the frightening truth about social attitudes ? violence towards women, be they daughter, mother, sister, wife, partner or paid domestic help, has become ?natural?. The silence is just a manifestation of this acceptance. 

 The countries in the study are Bangladesh, Brazil, Ethiopia, Japan, Peru, Namibia, Samoa, Serbia and Montenegro, Thailand, and the United Republic of Tanzania. They are predominantly countries of the South. It would be interesting to compare these results with those that would emerge from a similar study of the North. The present findings suggest that factors such as tradition, economy, level of education, repressive forms of social training contribute to both the violence and the silence. Would countries and societies in which the standard and quality of life are different show different results? Strategies to combat violence against women and to break through the wall of social complicity could be better honed by such an exercise.

 SEEDS OF FUTURE TROUBLE

 The Indian government seems oblivious to the dangers that the seeds bill presents to food security and farmers? interests, writes Samantak Das

 What you sow

 The seeds bill, 2004, introduced in the Rajya Sabha on December 8, 2004 and to be taken up by the Lok Sabha soon, has not received much public attention, despite the impact it will have on the lives of 726 million Indian farmers and the billion Indians who consume what these farmers produce.

 The bill?s stated objective includes ?increasing the use of quality seeds in comparison with farmers? saved seeds?; facilitating a ?climate of growth? for ?the private seed industry?; ?regulation of sale of seeds and increasing the availability of quality seed for sowing?; ?increasing private participation in seed production, distribution, certification and seed testing?; and ?liberalized import of seed and planting materials compatible with World Trade Organization commitments.?

 The seeds bill?s envisaging of an increased role for private sector and transnational seed corporations in Indian agriculture is based on assumptions that are not borne out either by experience or common sense. The bill invokes ?quality seeds? which, it asserts, are superior to traditional or folk crop seeds. In reality, 80 per cent of all seeds in use in India are farmer- developed folk seeds, which are adapted to environmental conditions and have been largely responsible for our self-sufficiency in food production. 

 The phrase, ?compatible with WTO commitments?, suggests that India has no option but to allow private and transnational companies to market patented seeds in India. This suggestion is strengthened by the third amendment to the Indian Patents Act (already in effect) that enables the patenting of methods of agriculture and plants (including seeds). But this is not quite the truth. Article 27.3 (b) of the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights explicitly provides for WTO signatories to ?exclude from patentability: plants and animals other than microorganisms, and essentially biological processes for the production of plants and animals?, and leaves scope for governments to prevent plants and seeds from being patented. The introduction of the seeds bill leaves one with the uncomfortable feeling that our government is willing to sacrifice farmers? rights, and the nation?s agricultural biodiversity and food security in order to benefit the transnational seed industry.

 Apart from the consequences it will have on individual, particularly medium and small-scale farmers (that is, the majority of Indian farmers), the seeds bill also has the potential to cause widespread social unrest. Imagine that you are the owner-cultivator of a medium-sized farm who has grown and developed seed varieties well suited to local soil and climatic conditions. You, like your forefathers before you, sell and barter seeds at the local haat every week. One haat day, after the seeds bill has become the seeds act, someone calling himself a government seed inspector asks you to hand over your seeds to him. When you challenges his authority to do so, he shows you chapter VI, clause 35 of the act which gives him the power to ?take samples of any seed of any kind or variety from any person selling such seed?. A few days later he comes to your house and demands that you show him your seed stocks. When you refuse, he cites the same clause empowering him to ?break-open any container in which any seed of any kind or variety may be contained or to break-open the door of any premises where any such seed may be kept for sale?. Already upset at having your seeds confiscated, and now threatened with having your door broken down, how would you react? 

 Already, the Indian state has lost effective control over vast swathes of land to radical political outfits. Imagine the weapon the seeds act will give such outfits. No farmer will stand up for a state which seems to have abandoned all interest in him and is allied with big business interests.

 Defenders of the seeds bill may point to chapter IX, clause 43, which apparently protects farmers? rights. This clause begins by stating, ?Nothing in this Act shall restrict the right of the farmer to save, use, exchange, share or sell his farm seeds and planting material? but then qualifies this by adding ?except that he shall not sell such seed or planting material under a brand name or? ? and then, the knockout punch ? ?which does not conform to the minimum limit of germination, physical purity, genetic purity prescribed?. These clauses empower the central seed committee to specify ?minimum limits of germination, genetic and physical purity, and maximum seed health, with respect to any seed of any kind or variety? and to demand that such data be indicated ?on the packet or container? by the producer. Which farmer has the technical know-how to do this? All that most farmers know of their own seed varieties is that they germinate and yield good crops in local conditions. Now, unless they can provide technical proof of their seeds? genetic purity and health, they cannot exchange or sell such seeds at all. No such problems exist for seed companies, with their corps of scientists and well-equipped laboratories, never mind if their hybrid seeds fail to show yield stability and contain a range of genetic impurities.

 The seeds bill also explicitly states, ?No seed of any kind or variety shall, for the purpose of sowing or planting by any person, be sold unless such seed is registered.? Since most of the seed varieties cultivated in India are not registered, what is a farmer to do in such a situation? If he uses his own farm-saved (unregistered) seeds, he faces the prospect of jail. The option is to use registered seeds produced by seed companies that may not be suited to local conditions. If such seeds fail, the producer can claim compensation under the Consumer Protection Act, but what are the chances of a farmer in a remote area actually receiving such compensation? And in how many years? time? As for the producer, he can be fined a maximum of Rs 50,000 , in the most extreme cases ? a laughable sum for large seed companies. 

 The seeds bill specifies that all seed processing units must be ?registered by the State Government?, and defines ?seed processing? as ?the process by which seeds and planting material are dried, threshed, shelled, ginned or delinted (in cotton), cleaned, graded or treated?. This definition turns every farmer into the owner of a seed processing unit, which, in turn, makes it imperative for him to register his ?unit? with the government! Unless he does so, he cannot sell or barter his seeds, even if they are registered varieties.

 Two final comments. Several provisions of the proposed act are in conflict with the Biodiversity Act and abrogate the right of Indian farmers to save, breed, use and exchange seeds of indigenous crop varieties. Two, there has been no attempt by the government to communicate even the basic features of this proposed act to the farmers. The bill is in English, a language alien to most of our farmers, and no effort has been made to translate it into the major Indian languages or have public debates on it. Even the media has been left in the dark.

 Thus we could well be heading into a future where something as basic as the food we eat will be determined by transnational commercial interests and not by what the people of India want. By the time we wake up to this, we may well have lost our food security and sovereignty over our nation?s agricultural resources.

 QUESTIONS OF FAITH AND LAW

 The Wheel of Law: India?s Secularism in Comparative Constitutional Context By Gary Jeffrey Jacobsohn, Princeton, ? 15.95

 In the first paperback edition of this book (originally written in 2003), the author undertakes a substantial academic challenge ? to compare and contrast Indian secularism with that of the United States of America and Israel in their constitutional context. This ?comparative trio? has developed three distinct avatars of secularism, defined as assimilative, visionary and ameliorative, attributed to the US, Israel and India respectively. Jacobsohn?s aim is to gauge whether religious liberty can be reconciled with constitutional secularism.

 A separation of the church from the state that is enshrined in the US polity is impossible, as the author argues, in Israel, where the Star of David epitomizes the Zionist inspiration behind the birth of the nation itself. 

 In a country where ?religion permeates everyday life and informs national identity? (though not a single religion) like India, the flag is also a symbol of its constitutional mindset. While some commentators have made the grave error of associating the saffron on the Indian tricolour with Hindus, the green with the Muslims, and the white with the desire for peace between these communities, the author cites Jawaharlal Nehru addressing the Constituent Assembly, arguing that the colours stood for revolution and industry, agriculture and commerce instead.

 The author focusses on the ?Hindutva cases? of the mid-Nineties in the Supreme Court after the destruction of the Babri Masjid. The verdicts, especially in defining ?cultural nationalism? gives the judiciary?s power a different contour in India vis-?-vis the US and Israel.

 Article IV, Section 4 of the Guarantee Clause in the US was evoked to deter the federal government from acting against the southern states? insistence on continuing slavery. This can be attributed to the liberal insistence on absolute neutrality. Similarly, a long-standing demand of the Hindutva-mongers in India has been to establish a uniform civil code, deterred thus far by India?s ameliorative concept of secularism. 

 The author criticizes some of the Hindutva ideologues of advocating a ?slavish emulation? of the Israeli polity in India. The assimilative model of secularism in the US is also questioned, when Jacobsohn suggests that political assimilation is increasingly being coupled with social assimilation, implying standardization. 

 Here are some questions for Jacobsohn. Do religion and civil society need to be problematically intertwined? Can the ?crisis of secularism? be understood in relation to just the Hindutva movement? Ultimately, Jacobsohn?s analysis concludes at a rather persuasive argument. American social and political life is significantly impacted by the church on issues of public concern such as abortion and education. In India, there has been no attempt to artificially water down this impact by assimilation. Such an effort would only be a failed attempt at homogenization.

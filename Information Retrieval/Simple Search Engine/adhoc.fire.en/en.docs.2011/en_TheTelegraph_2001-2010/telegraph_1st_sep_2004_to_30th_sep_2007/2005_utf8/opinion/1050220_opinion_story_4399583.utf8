 DIARY

 Mobile phones can be quite a pest. Anyone who has been rattled by a raucous and persistent ringtone in the middle of a concert will empathize with Jack Straw and Natwar Singh when they were forced by an insistent beep to appeal to the assembled journalists to switch off their cell phones. After all, this was a formal press conference by the British home secretary and the Indian foreign minister, and their complete and undivided attention was the very least of the courtesies the reporters could pay the two dignitaries. But this offender was particularly obdurate. It continued to beep away even as heads turned in embarrassment and hands fished about in pockets. But where was the instrument? Suddenly, Natwar Singh could be seen apologizing profusely to Straw. Everyone broke out into laughter when they realized that it had been the minister?s mobile all along, and humour saved the day.

 Wars have been fought for less. As it is, all Maharashtrians worth their puran poli are up in arms; the Congressmen among them are especially angry ? they have dashed off a letter to 10 Janpath in protest. On the face of it, they seem to have enough reason to be miffed. SM Krishna, appointed governor in Mumbai some time ago is a former CM of Karnataka; Margaret Alva, the AICC gen-sec in charge of Maharashtra is also from Karnataka, as is Gurudas Kamath, the Congress?s state unit chief. Other Kannadigas: Shivraj Patil; Suresh Shetty, a state minister; and Jagannath Hegde, the sheriff of Mumbai. Seems like a virtual take-over by the fellows from the state across the southern border. 

 All the adulation after Black seems to have mellowed the original Angry Young Man. At least as far as the press is concerned. Amitabh Bachchan might be past sixty, but reporters have found that the man can be quite touchy about his privacy. So, when local photographers in Bhopal (where he?d gone to celebrate his mother-in-law?s 75th birthday) finally caught up with the Big B at the airport as he was boarding his flight, they were hesitant initially. But the actor was in an expansive mood. ?Arre bhaiyya, deri kis baat ki. Photo khinchiye. Kisne mana kiya hai?? he said in his trademark Bhojpuri. He even obligingly arranged for a cosy family snap ? pulling daughter Shweta closer to him and instructing Abhishek to move to Jaya?s side. He also shook hands with the journos. By the time he left, there were quite a few starry eyes behind.

 Now that Girija Vyas has left to head the National Commission for Women, who will be the AICC spokesperson? Ambika Soni? Even last year, Soni would have very happily accepted the post. But that was before the Congress came to power. Now she is looking at better prizes ? the chief ministership of Punjab or the Union I amp;B ministry. If not Soni, then who? Satyavrat Chaturvedi who hasn?t been getting along with Salman Khurshid in Uttar Pradesh? Or Anand Sharma, whom no one wants? All the other spokespersons are at loggerheads with him and the journalists are chary of attending his briefings because he gives out no information and puts them to sleep with his long-windedness. Ajit Jogi, Jayanthi Natarajan, Janardhan Dwivedi are other names doing the rounds. But the only other candidate worth talking about is Devendranath Dwivedi. A senior and out-of-work Congressman, Dwivedi has something to say about everything, begins every answer with ?There are three things...? and ends with two, and most important, has a way with words. He once described a BJP young turk, a noted lawyer, in chaste Hindi, ?Woh sajjan to agyan aur ahankar ke adbhut sangam hain...? Now that?s what you would call a biting byte.

 For a party that?s been on a high since May, the revelations of Nagma?s alleged links with the D-Company was an embarrassment it could have done without. But who recruited her and who were her backers? One Congress G-sec passed the buck to another, until it stopped at the door of a Union minister who had survived every Congress boss from Indira to Sonia Gandhi. His ingenious excuse: he wanted to help out a ?co-religionist?. But there is no dearth of party colleagues waiting to to provide the low down on how the said minister had promised the actress a Rajya Sabha seat or how a certain functionary in the AICC?s media department had introduced her to journalists. But what?s the use of all this dirt now that the damage has already been done?

 No one talks about Maneka Gandhi these days. But the lady doesn?t care ? she has been busy with her animal-rights and environment activism. And she bares her teeth occasionally, given half a chance. As she did at a recent meeting of the parliamentary consultative committee on environment, wildlife and forests, chaired by her successor, A Raja. The minister was trying to tomtom his department?s move to clean up Mumbai?s Powai lake at the cost of Rs 6 crore. But the lady ? facts and figures on her fingertips, her forceful vocabulary brought to bear on her aggression ? rubbished all his claims. Nothing had been done, she declared. Worse, what had the ministry done about the gross violations of environment norms by private firms in Bhuj and Kalahandi? And what about the Ganga action plan, where despite the Rs 18,000 crore spent, the Ganga continued to be extremely dirty? Any answers, Sonia?

 WHERE MIND IS FEARLESS

 A master in Eton used to ask his students, ?Do you want me to cram you for a first or do you want me to open up your minds?? The present hue and cry about examinations creating too much pressure on students is rooted in the polarity that the old schoolmaster drew attention to. Education in India ? syllabi, pedagogy and mode of assessment ? has become too concentrated on how to do well in examinations. This has become the sole criterion for deciding how good or bad a student is. Success in examinations has become the solitary aim of education. It is assumed that someone who has done well in his examinations, especially the board exams, is a good student. Comprehension, knowledge, ability to think for oneself, range of reading and a general awareness are all considered less important than the marksheet when the results are announced. One consequence of this is that students think of nothing else other than doing well in the school-leaving exams and they work themselves up into a frenzy. This is the principal cause of what is known as exam stress. The solution to this does not lie in anodyne recommendations like having test centres near the school, extending the grade system, avoiding postponement, changing the structure of question papers, putting in place a uniform system of board examination and so on. These recommendations were made by a group of experts at a meeting called by the ministry of human resources development.

 The problem is deep and complicated, and its tentacles go into the interstices of society and the values it lives by. There is a growing tendency to undervalue knowledge and learning qua knowledge and learning. Everything has to be useful or has to have a purpose. The purpose of education is to be good at something that has utility, and the measure of being good at something is the results that one gets in the examinations. This is reflected in the way schools are being reduced to crammers, in the mushrooming of tutorial homes and in the expectations that parents and peers have of a student. Education as an instrument to develop a child?s mind, to open it up to ideas and to the world at large, has fallen by the wayside. A student who knows a lot but does not do well in examinations is considered at best to be other worldly, or at worst, a fool. 

 The problem is also not new. One outstanding student of Presidency College has recently written that when she went to an Ivy League university after a brilliant career in Calcutta, she discovered that she was a good exam-taker but was not free in her thinking. The child is the nation?s future. Experts who think about education should ensure that in schools and colleges, students have their minds unlocked. That is what is primary to education. Success in examinations is much less important. Once this happens, stress will also evaporate.

 WAIT UNTIL LIGHT

 Despite the encouraging statistics relating to its growth, West Bengal?s future continues to look bleak, writes Satrujit Banerjee

 Hard at work

 Aspate of recent reports and editorials 

 seem to indicate that West Bengal?s economy is taking giant 

 strides and can now be bracketed with that of the frontline 

 states in the country. Sceptics, however, claim that the 

 acronym ?Bimaru? ? comprising economically laggard states 

 like Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh 

 ? should now be modified to ?Bimabu?. West Bengal should 

 replace Rajasthan, and new states like Uttaranchal, Jharkhand 

 and Chhattisgarh added to the list together with the old 

 laggards Assam and Tripura. Which of this is true?

 Economic reforms, started in 1991 by the Central government, seem to have augured well for West Bengal. West Bengal?s growth rate from 1993-94 to 2001-02 was 7.2 per cent, second only to Karnataka?s 8.11. The corresponding figure for India is 6.3 per cent and Punjab 3.8 per cent. During the same period, the average per capita income grew by 5.5 per cent in West Bengal against 4.3 per cent nationally. This is all the more creditable as Bengal?s population growth since 1981 is a high 2.34 per cent annually, primarily because of the influx from Bangladesh.

 In agriculture, West Bengal is without question a front line player. It contributes 14.6 per cent of the country?s total production. It also has the third highest average yield in India ? 2,424 kgs per hectare against the national average of 1,739. To put this in context, consider that Punjab and Haryana have 89.72 per cent and 65 per cent respectively of its agricultural acreage irrigated against West Bengal?s 28.1 per cent. A comparison of yield per hectare is revealing. In 2001-02, Punjab produced 24.89 million tonnes from its 38.47 lakh hectares of irrigated land against West Bengal?s 16.50 million tonnes from 19.11 lakh hectares of comparable land. This works out to an astounding 34 per cent more yield per acre despite the preponderance of marginal-sized holdings resulting from land reforms. Any further increase in the yield will require an increase in acreage irrigated, an expenditure normally incurred by the Central government. With the current political set-up in New Delhi, it is surprising that this issue does not figure at all in the common minimum programme. 

 A comparative study among states of both the levels and growth rates of the net state domestic product would, in theory, provide an ideal platform to examine how each state is faring. However, the data is obtained from the state directorates of statistics concerned and their reliability can be questioned. Yet, some trends emerge. For the period 1985-86 to1990-91, Bengal recorded a growth of 24.52 per cent in NSDP, the sixth lowest in the country, Rajasthan at 63.35 per cent was highest, with Andhra at 45.97 per cent and Maharashtra 45.47 per cent. However, from 1995-96 to 1999-2000, Bengal recorded a 33.12 per cent growth and Rajasthan 23.97 per cent.

 Sceptics argue that the high growth rate of Bengal is not as creditable as it seems because of the low base resulting from dismal growth in the preceding years. According to the National Sample Survey Organisation, those who do not earn enough to provide a minimum calorie intake of 2,400 calories in rural and 2,100 calories in urban areas, are below the poverty line. Using this scale, West Bengal in 1999-2000 had 27.02 per cent of its population below the poverty line, higher than the national figure of 26.10 per cent and Rajasthan?s 15.28 per cent. As ?domestic products? and poverty levels do not reflect ?human development? or its lack thereof, the UNDP has introduced two comprehensive indices to reflect the ?quality of life? and ?deprivations?.

 The human development index ?is a simple summary measure of the three dimensions of the human development concept: living a long and healthy life, being educated and decent standard of living ? Thus measures of life expectancy, school enrolment, literacy and income are all considered for this index. Human poverty index, on the other hand, ?focuses on deprivations in three dimensions: longevity, as measured by the probability at birth of not surviving to age 40; knowledge as measured by the adult literacy rate; and overall economic provisioning, as measured by the percentage of people not using improved water resources and the percentage without sustainable access to an improved water source and the percentage of people under-weight for age.? 

 Some empirical evidence regarding the levels of HDI and HPI for different states is now made available by the national human development report of the Planning Commission. On HDI, West Bengal ranked 22nd in 1981 and an equally dismal 20th in 1991. In a study done for only 15 states for 2001, it ranked 8th. HPI rankings for 1981 and 1991 show West Bengal at 17th and 20th respectively. Figures for 2001 are not yet available but it is safe to assume that the state has fared better.

 Since West Bengal has done better in the last decade, will it continue its ascent? Significant improvement of HDI and HPI scores will require sizeable investment. This is where the state is facing its biggest hurdle. Its finances are in total disarray. Revised estimates of budget 2003-04 show wages, pension and interest payments constituting 101 per cent of the revenue receipts and of this, interest liability alone accounts for 43.3 per cent. The fiscal deficit as a percentage of the state?s GDP is an astronomical 8.5 per cent. Seventy five per cent of the registered small-scale sector units in the state are sick. 

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is doing his bit by discouraging bandhs and gheraos, but the private sector is wary. A revealing front page news a few days back in this newspaper proclaimed that post-1991, West Bengal attracted the highest capital, next only to Gujarat, ahead of Maharashtra , UP and Andhra. However, a quick look at the comparative figures reveal that a crore invested in West Bengal translates into 2.52 jobs against 3.75 in Andhra, 3.92 in UP, 4.05 in Gujarat, and 5.60 jobs in Maharashtra. But unless a serious dent is made on the poverty front by large scale employment of blue collar workers in the manufacturing sector, HDI and HPI scores will not get better. 

 A majority of the literate unemployed cannot be absorbed in the services sector because they lack communication skills in English. The left policy of banishing English from schools is coming back to haunt it. As for the barely literate, a blue collar job is a pipe dream. Worse still, the state government, the principal employer, can barely pay its current wage and pension bill. In short, the future currently looks bleak.

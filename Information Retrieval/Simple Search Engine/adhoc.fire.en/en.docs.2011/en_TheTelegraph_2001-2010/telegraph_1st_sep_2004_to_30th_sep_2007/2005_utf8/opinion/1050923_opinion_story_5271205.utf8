 OFF THE RECORD AND ON IT

 malvika singh

 How odd that in this day and age journalists of national papers conduct ?interviews? without tape recorders. In my time we used rather cumbersome recording devices and on occasions when we took notes, the final text was approved of by the person who had been interviewed. The intention of an interview in those days was to probe a person, to skilfully delve into the thinking of that individual and write a story. It was not to present out-of-context sound bites. My generation of journalists also abided by ?off the record?. Those meetings gave one insights for future stories and interviews. Alas, the norms have changed.

 What we witnessed recently ? the Rahul Gandhi ?interview? saga ? exposes a new and strange ?ethic?. There was no recorded Q and A, therefore there was no interview, so how on earth was it published as a Q and A? Why has this profession become so fickle? Where has journalistic morality gone? Why this desperation for sensationalism and ?scoops? at any cost? Why this manic obsession with the members of the Nehru/Gandhi family? No wonder the Gandhi family stays away from the press and instead, gets on with doing what it has to. 

 Off the record means off the record. A true scoop must be ?on the record?, using correct means. This time Tehelka was wrong. The sad aspect of this ?incident? was the reaction of some senior journalists to the episode. One was jumping about delighted that the Congress spokespeople were banging on in an inarticulate manner, being of no help at all. He continued with his vitriolic diatribe about Rahul Gandhi, without knowing him, without having spoken to him. It sounded hysterical, ludicrous and unnecessary. One felt as if one were part of a scene from the theatre of the absurd. What had Rahul Gandhi said or done to deserve this kind of abuse? Nothing at all. More important, why was this media man so gripped by the need to castigate an innocent member of parliament for no reason whatsoever? Is the press there to hound and abuse people or is it expected to disseminate and present information?

 Hard pressed

 These regular boo-boos drive all dignified people away from the press. How often, when real ?interviews? are culled to meet word count requirements, when some comment is shortened, it is invariably taken out of context? An intelligent statement comes across as moronic. This reality never reflects the inadequacies of the journalist who often has no real understanding of the issue. This superficiality of the journalist makes the expert sound like a fool. The print media, in trying to compete for space with television, appears to have diluted its rules. Vibrant and explicit written words once generated ideas. No longer. Today, at the mercy of a discredited press, one never knows what to believe and what to reject. ?Who knows if it?s true or not?, has become a regular chant everywhere. 

 In other parts of the world there is a clear divide separating the broadsheet and tabloid press. Some are polarized and partisan, others are balanced. Individual products do not cater all things to all people. The confusion here is that most products are not clearly defined and many journalists no longer operate within a code of conduct. Anarchy seems to dominate and the captive consumer is being dumbed down, insulted and compelled to sift through half-truths, blatant lies, personal vendettas that are written up as lead stories. 

 Years were spent following the infamous Bofors kickbacks, reams were written, reputations were destroyed, and today we are none the wiser. We have had no fruitful investigative journalism that has provided any proof for all the accusations that were made. This is merely one example, related to the same family that journalists are relentlessly pursuing even today for different reasons.

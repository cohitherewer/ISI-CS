 AGAINST LETTERS

 A literacy drive on a war footing may sound commendable, but might, quite comically, fall on its face. That is what has happened in the village of Birsingha, the birthplace of Iswarchandra Vidyasagar, which the West Bengal government had chosen to make into a model, fully-literate village. Twenty-three literacy centres had been set up, and the government had generously distributed lure in the form of candy, biscuits, lamps and kerosene to the pupils. But the government?s dreams are not enough. A three-day survey by the State Resource Centre in the village revealed 137 illiterate persons, who have not only refused, steadfastly, to become literate, but have also threatened to flee the village if any more literacy is forced upon them. Poor Mr Biman Bose, the chairman of the Left Front and also the president of the Bangiya Saksharata Prasar Samiti, could only express his disappointment and blame it on the villagers? lack of awareness. He has admitted that the government cannot force them to learn, nor can it get the police to compel them.

 That is an interesting admission, if slightly ludicrous. It is difficult to believe that the 137 black sheep are suffering from a belated reaction to the pioneer of education in Bengal. Could it be, rather, a reaction against the government?s approach? Imposing a dream ? total literacy in this case ? may be a noble mission, but often the assumption behind it is that the objects of development do not know what is good for them. The first task of the missionary is to convince them of its necessity. The government has failed in Birsingha because it has failed to bring 137 persons round to its way of thinking. Candies and kerosene cannot work where persuasion and logic ? and sensitiveness ? have failed. Mr Bose?s rhetoric suggests that the government is more disappointed at having failed in its own project of making a spectacular success of the literacy project in Vidyasagar?s birthplace. West Bengal desperately needs to improve in literacy ? a sustained programme over the years would have borne greater fruit by now than sudden dramatic gestures. In West Bengal, people barely managing to sign their names are counted as literate. Perhaps it is too much to hope that the recalcitrant 137 would have forced the government to think anew.

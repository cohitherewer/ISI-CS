 GAMES BY OTHER RULES

 MALVIKA SINGH

 Why have we let politicking, in the worst possible way, infiltrate our lives in every sphere? The absolutely loutish manner in which former skipper Sourav Ganguly was ejected from the cricket team, in fact, from playing the game per se, leaves a sordid saga unexplained. And how fickle our public opinion is as it swings like a badly balanced pendulum. Players are dropped, new players are brought in, some are retired from the A team, the coach is unnecessarily accused of all kinds of unsubstantiated ?wrongs? and the cricket fraternity bears it all. The BCCI appears to be a body peopled with politicians instead of pros. Ordinary citizens who enjoy the game do not want to see any national player treated with indignity. Where gracious behaviour was once the norm, we have been drowned by the tsunami of impropriety. The last lot that ?controlled? cricket displayed an unchecked arrogance, a trait of dictatorial dispensations. Alas, the new group of heavies seem to be falling into a similar trap. It all goes against what was once defined as the discipline and correctness of sportsmanship. Another institution has fallen into disrepute. 

 Parliamentarians, Central and state cabinet ministers, senior and junior administrators, municipalities, social service providers, private operators, all appear to function with corrupt practices. This single largest tragedy in India has seared our body politic, our skin and flesh. When the UPA came to power with Manmohan Singh at the helm, hope swept across the layers of social order. Many hoped and some believed that a stern corrective would most definitely be initiated by him personally, since he was not carrying the ?baggage? of corrupted contemporary Indian politics. However, there is not even a glimmer of light in that direction. Instead, as rampant improprieties of those in power are revealed, and as the administrative machinery rapidly protects itself by entering the dark and sealed pipe of denial, those who make the policy and law that govern us are perceived to be in a state of denial as well. They all seem to have abdicated their responsibility and oath of office. 

 Morals on the loose

 Strident retaliation to legitimate criticism and to the questioning of the malfunctioning of administrations and political cabals by the citizens of India, has created a mood of deep despondency. There was hope that the present prime minister would represent the aspirations of the people to clean up and restore a decaying polity.

 When those poor old parliamentarians were caught on camera accepting bits and pieces of cash for asking questions within parliament, where Jawaharlal Nehru made his pledge with destiny, where was our present prime minister?s moral statement? Where was his damnation of the petty greed of some of his colleagues? Why did he not apologize to us, on behalf of those elected representatives who sit with him in parliament and who had insulted us all? The proven misuse of us taxpayers and our money, as they mock democratic norms in Parliament House, needs a far more elaborate explanation than the mere suspension of a dozen odd members caught in the act. Maybe all members of both houses should be compelled to take a six-month salary cut. That rather substantial amount of money should be put, as a contribution, into the consolidated fund of India!

 With this sordid reality along with the atmosphere it creates that chokes us each day comes the relentless harassment of ordinary people who work hard and generate both wealth and pride. Will those at the helm of governance pledge to restore a life of dignity to those men and women whose inherent integrity, intellectual honesty, cultural roots, faith and religion did not allow them to exploit one and all with free abandon?

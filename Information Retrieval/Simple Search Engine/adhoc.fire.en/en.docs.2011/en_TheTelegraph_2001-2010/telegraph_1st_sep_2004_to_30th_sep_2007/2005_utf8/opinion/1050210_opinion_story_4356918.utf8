 BUSINESS ONLY, NO FUN AT ALL 

 Gouri Chatterjee

 Not even a month old, NDTV Profit is already trying to live up to its name. It has, it claims, beaten the leader CNBC TV-18 ?with a market share of 57.9 per cent compared to CNBC?s 42.1 per cent in the all day parts in the C amp;S 4+ all India market?. Nonsense, the CNBC has retorted, pointing to its ?pole position among English news channels with 36 per cent share of 25+ males in SEC AB?.

 If that sounds like gobbledegook, it is. It is the sound of desperation. There are far too many business channels for anyone?s comfort, with many more expected to join the ranks within the year. And the victory stand is likely to have place for only one. 

 After all, even the US has only one business channel, CNBC. CNN pulled the plug on its CNNfn this December. News that Fox News may branch out into a business channel this year has sent shivers down the GE-owned CNBC?s spine. 

 No wonder NDTV is jumping the gun. There is little else to differentiate the two, so alike are they in form and content. So the high-stakes rat-a-tat will continue until one channel does an Economic Times, down to portraying the finance minister and his budget team as team Lagaan. Profit always favours the populist.

 One winner

 The Election Commission may or may not be Laloo Prasad Yadav?s best friend but it is certainly a well-wisher of the media. Imagine what would have happened if the elections had been over and done with, as the Bihar supremo had wanted, well before the budget season began.

 Going by the first phase exit polls, Bihar would have a hung assembly, hard bargaining for the chief minister?s post would be under way and Laloo would no longer be the media darling he is today. Not that he would lose his ability to play the press as adroitly as Ravi Shankar plays the sitar, but what use would that be sans the halo of political invincibility? A charismatic loser is a contradiction in terms.

 And then what would have happened to all the channels gunning to make a big splash with the rail budget this year? Yes, the rail budget, usually the poor cousin of the real budget two days later. 

 Till 2003, that is. Thanks entirely to the UPA government?s choice of the rail minister, the picture changed last year. Rail budget 2004 recorded a 72 per cent jump in viewership over the one presented by Nitish Kumar the year before. Advertisers, the channels know, salivate at such figures. 

 All would have been lost if the Election Commission had not prolonged the minister?s agony in his home state. Instead, the three-phase voting in Bihar has meant the rail budget will be presented on 26th February, just one day before the results. Whatever the outcome, the media wins.

 Different thirst

 Who wants to be a journalist? Not even all journalists, found a survey conducted by Mediabuddies, an online press club that claims membership from 40 countries including India though mostly from England and America. 

 The ?first global study? into the lifestyles of scribblers found one out of four would have chosen another career if they had their lives over again and only two, repeat two out of 100, want their children to follow them in their career. Even though three-fourths believe in what they write and promote despite ?some compromises?. 

 Maybe it is because they are ?hard working? (83 per cent think so) but not ?hard drinking? (75 per cent say they are not). That would explain another finding: journalists over 59 are the happiest. There was a time when the ?hard working? and ?hard drinking? percentages were reversed.

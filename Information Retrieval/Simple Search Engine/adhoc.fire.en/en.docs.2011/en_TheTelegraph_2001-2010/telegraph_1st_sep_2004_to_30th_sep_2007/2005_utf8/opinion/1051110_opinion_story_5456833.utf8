 OPEN SECRET

 All the good boys and girls live in India. According to the latest sex survey by Durex, Indians are the last to lose their virginity ? they do it when they are almost 20, have the fewest sexual partners, and are perfectly happy with their sex lives even though they have sex only 75 times a year against the world average of 103. Such innocence is almost prelapsarian; perhaps the Indian should learn about his idyllic existence from the survey. Surveys distil evidence from a wide spectrum of cases, so part of the sense of unreality that some survey results throw up can be put down to that. A survey of sex, sexual history, habits and responses, though, is not like any other. The most candid of people tend to lose their candour when it comes to questions about sex. Researchers, scientists and doctors have always admitted that this is one subject most difficult to study, because personal evidence can be extremely dodgy. Not that people want to lie, although that is quite common as well. They may like to believe certain things about themselves and their relationships that may colour their understanding of the truth. It is as tempting to be the cock of the walk as the desirable demure belle. And as satisfying to display fidelity as to obliterate from personal history ? from memory ? snubs, performance shutdowns, misadventures and dangerous liaisons.

 The survey results may very well be representative. But it is amazing that the middle-class Indian, one of the tribes most hypocritical about sex in the whole world, will read in it what he wants to read. It confirms all the values his forefathers have taught him, including that of virginity. The flipside of this is the condemnation for women who have sex outside marriage, whether coerced or no, and the suicidal self-loathing of rape victims. The age of loss of virginity as well as the evidence of comparative fidelity could raise questions about which of India?s numerous population groups the survey does represent. Framed otherwise, the same question could read thus: how far have Indians internalized the patriarchal values of the society they live in? Other questions could be added: how many sex workers, male, female and third gender, professional and amateur, are there? How many minor girls are married off, how many girls and women sold into sex slavery, how many children, of either sex, molested in their homes? And last of all, if sex surveys are intended to help in studies of sexual health, should not there be a way to pick out the most vulnerable?

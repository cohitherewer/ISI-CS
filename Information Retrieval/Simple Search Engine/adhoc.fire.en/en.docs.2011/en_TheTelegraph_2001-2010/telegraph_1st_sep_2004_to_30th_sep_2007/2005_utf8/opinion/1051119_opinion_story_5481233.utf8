 Letters to Editor

 Film over the eyes

 Sir ? Talk about double standards. Mainstream Tamil films could give vulgarity a new definition. (The uninitiated may please watch Surya, Jaya TV, or any of the Tamil channels on satellite television.) The gyrations and strategic display of flesh would easily make soft porn grade. But neither censor-board members nor Tamil viewers think reel women seducing men with scantily-covered breasts heaving to the beat of the music denigrate Tamil womanhood in any way. Of course, that only happens when someone dares to say that pre-marital sex is okay as long as it is safe.

 Yours faithfully,

 Ratna Sen, Calcutta

 Calling all members

 Sir ? The additional protocol to the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation?s regional convention on suppression of terrorism has come into force, with all the seven countries ratifying it in order to wage a joint war against terrorism (?Manmohan wants ?surplus? of trust?, Nov 14). Saarc foreign ministers aim to have zero tolerance to terrorism in all forms and manifestations. This, they think, will help the member countries meet the challenge of terrorism. The additional protocol is, undoubtedly, a positive development as it would enable Saarc countries to work together on the legal aspects of combating terrorism as well.

 Yours faithfully,

Komalika Bhattacharya, Calcutta

 Sir ? If Saarc has to achieve regional cooperation, it has to exclude Pakistan. The latter?s latest proposal to induct China as an observer is only meant to spite India. Yet Kashmir, which is what Pakistan really wants, cannot be offered to it on a platter. Bus, train, air-links and gas pipelines prove futile as peace measures. 

 To expand Saarc?s regional role, Afghanistan, Myanmar and Mauritius should be brought within its ambit. And India, which accounts for over 70 per cent of the population, resources and landmass in Saarc, must play a more sagacious role to promote unity and strengthen economic ties. 

 Yours faithfully,

Raghubir Singh, Pune

 Sir ? Prime Minister Manmohan Singh?s proposal at the Saarc summit that all south Asian countries should provide reciprocal transit facilities to connect one another, as well as with the Gulf, central Asia, and south-east Asia, reflects his vision. The move will also be a significant step towards establishing a multi-polar world. Singh?s proposal for the creation of a south Asian university, which would provide world-class facilities to students in the region, is praiseworthy. 

 Saarc has made the right move by inviting the war-torn state of Afghanistan to join it, given the close cultural and historical ties the member-nations share with it. India deserves accolades for heading this campaign. But above everything else, the members should learn to cooperate on issues affecting the region ? be it terrorism or economic crisis. 

 Yours faithfully,

Suman Barthakur, Guwahati

 Sir ? The telephone charges within the Saarc countries are not in keeping with Saarc?s aim of regional cooperation and better understanding between the people of the member nations. The international calling rates remain quite high. For example, the current ISD rate for calls to the United States of America, the United Kingdom and Canada is Rs 7.20 per minute. The rest of Europe (except UK), and Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Indonesia share a common rate of Rs 9.60 per minute. But for the rest of the world (including Bangladesh), the rate is an exorbitant Rs 18 per minute. Saarc countries should take appropriate measures to reduce the charges between member nations.

 Yours faithfully,

A. Khair, Calcutta

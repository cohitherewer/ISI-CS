 ANYTHING FOR A PLACE AT THE HIGH TABLE 

 Achin Vanaik argues that despite the defence deal between the two nations, the US will not support India?s bid to secure a permanent seat in the security council, even one without the veto

 Symbolic gesture

 The Indian government signed an extraordinary defence arrangement with the United States of America late last month, effectively declaring its willingness to be a subordinate ally in the US?s plans to establish an informal global empire. Of course, the enthusiasts of this defence arrangement are never upfront about stating what the US?s political purpose is ? to tie up as many countries as possible into its hub-and-spokes strategic arrangement. This way, all potential opponents would pay more attention to maintaining the health of their relations with the US, than think about ways to counter it. 

 Indian strategic analysts trot out all the usual rationale about how good the defence deal is, how it is to be valued because of the common need to tackle terrorism. In practice, this refers to how the arrangement might help the US ? the state most guilty of international terrorist-like behaviour ? confront its selectively defined ?terrorist? opponents more strongly. 

 The deal will help India get more defence goodies, they say. But this will only make India more dependent on, and grateful for, US military help. And how the deal will lead to regional stability ? in other words, help stabilize US dominance over the Indian Ocean upto the Straits of Malacca with India faithfully playing the role of junior naval partner in this geo-political project. But since the US has its own gameplan, signing the deal is not going to help India in its efforts to get a permanent seat in the United Nations security council. 

 In fact, the desperate striving after a permanent seat by the Indian elite and government is one component of a more comprehensive farce that is being played out at various levels. But why is there this desperate striving? Because the Indian elite and government want India to now ?make it? as a world power and are scrambling for the symbols that might plausibly convince themselves, if not others, that it has arrived. But first, how worthwhile is the quest itself?

 The security council has never been an instrument or a body exercising real power. All it could hope to be was an instrument of legitimization for what the really powerful member countries (the US or the Soviet Union, at one point) wanted to do. But during the Cold War era (barring the rare joint operation), the security council could not even play this limited legitimizing role because of the veto conflict between the two giants. After the end of the Cold War, only the US can, at least sometimes, manipulate the security council to do its bidding. 

 The other members cannot similarly use the security council since they cannot push an unwilling US to go along with their aspirations. 

 What then are the benefits given to existing or aspiring permanent members? Frankly, there aren?t any. All the security-council membership can do for the newcomers is give them the trappings of self-importance, that is membership of a select club whose very selectiveness is its primary mark of status. 

 Of course, expansion will create two tiers of members. The existing first-class members have the power of veto, which only the US will exercise ruthlessly. Britain is a lapdog of US foreign policy and can be relied upon not to oppose US ambitions. 

 Today?s France is not that of Charles de Gaulle, the last Western leader who was prepared to vigorously defy the US diplomatically. Paris will only rarely resist US pressure in the security council. 

 The same can be said of today?s Russia, while China has only exercised the negative veto on four occasions, all having to do with its own closest preoccupations, like Taiwan. Its demeanour is very different in the case of more distant foreign policy issues. For example, on the occasion of the first Gulf war of 1991, the US threat that it would withhold the most-favoured-nation trade status was enough to get Chinese abstention on the vote to get security-council clearance for the US assault on Iraq. During the second Gulf war, both Russia and China were happy to let France do the diplomatic running in the bid to deny security-council legitimacy for the war the US had launched anyway.

 But supine as the performance of the four first-class members of the security council has been, all that the aspirants will get is a worthless second-class membership without veto power. In fact, the group of four countries (Brazil, Germany, Japan, India) have quickly abandoned the effort to press for first-class membership status. They have declared their willingness to settle for permanent membership without veto power, asking that the issue come up (merely) for discussion after 15 years. So they are not even demanding that after a lapse of time they must get the power of veto.

 And what have been the responses? The US has made it clear that it opposes Germany?s application because it wants to punish that country for being the only one to side with France during the diplomatic build-up in the UN before the March 2003 invasion of Iraq. This despite the fact that France and Germany, along with China, Russia and the United Kingdom, obsequiously endorsed (through UN resolutions) the subsequent US occupation of the country, despite its illegality. 

 So Washington is trying to divide the G-4 by saying it favours only the Japanese (Japan is another long-established foreign-policy lapdog of the US) and Indian applications. This did give rise to minor waves of ecstasy in Indian strategic circles for a while, but Tokyo rejected the offer in the name of G-4 unity, forcing New Delhi to do the same subsequently. Of course, Japan did this because it knows China is opposed to its security-council membership and would veto any independent application it made, while it would be a little more difficult for China to reject the bloc application of the G-4 as a whole. 

 The US knows that its own suggestion to separate Japan and India from the G-4 application would be opposed by China, making it a non-starter. But then Washington was never interested in its own suggestion coming to fruition.

 The G-4 proposal is also a non-starter because only Britain and France say they are willing to support it, knowing full well that for different reasons, Russia, China and the US, all oppose it. Once again, France and the UK have scored some diplomatic points but are happy knowing that the status quo is most likely to remain despite all the desperate G-4 diplomatic lobbying now going on. 

 Just how insignificant the whole issue is in Washington has been made clear by Condoleezza Rice. The US secretary of state has repeatedly said that higher priority must be given to other kinds of UN political reforms, for example, instituting a new human rights council and a peace-building mission. Of course, this is nothing but subterfuge for the US?s bid to further institutionalize UN subordination to its imperial project, disguised as ?military humanism?.

 Once, a more principled India would have fought for the abolition of the veto and for greater democratization of the UN, especially reforms seeking to subordinate the security council to the general assembly. But those days are long gone. Today?s Indian elite and government fully deserve to be enmeshed in this ongoing farce, one that will not end even if India finally secures a meaningless membership of the security council.

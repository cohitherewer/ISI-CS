 Letters to Editor

 A woman scorned

 Sir ? The behaviour of Mamata Banerjee in the Lok Sabha last Thursday ? hurling papers at the chair, knowing full well that the session was being telecast live ? was unpardonable (?Mamata casts shame at House?, Aug 5). She has crossed all limits of parliamentary decency. It is difficult to understand why the speaker, Somnath Chatterjee, is trying to persuade her to withdraw her resignation. Her action ought to invite expulsion from parliament.

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir ? As the speaker of the Lok Sabha, Somnath Chatterjee is supposed to be above party politics, but he failed in this role when recently he chose to disagree with the Supreme Court?s ruling on the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunal) Act. On August 4, he revealed his bias further when he disallowed the Trinamool Congress leader, Mamata Banerjee, to raise the issue of illegal migrants in the house. Was he really going strictly by the book? Or was it that the issue was too sensitive for his comfort? He, and his fellow leftists have chosen to turn a blind eye to the infiltration through our eastern border. From the time when Sriprakash Jaiswal was home minister to the days of L.K. Advani, the government has kept a record of the illegal migration from Bangladesh. In 2002, the National Democratic Alliance government had informed parliament that there were 50 lakh Bangladeshi infiltrators in Assam, 57 lakh in West Bengal, 4.79 lakh in Bihar, 3.25 lakh in Tripura, 59.5 thousand in Nagaland and 3.75 lakh in Delhi. And still, the Central government told the apex court that there was no authentic record of the infiltrators. Does it mean that the information given by ministers in parliament is not authentic? As the speaker, shouldn?t Chatterjee have possessed this information? 

 As a Marxist, whose party is supporting the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government, Chatterjee is perhaps trying to defend the Congress, which had enacted the IMDT Act only for Assam. His plea that the judiciary should not interfere in the affairs of parliament sounds dictatorial. Perhaps he wants the judiciary to appreciate that many members of parliament and legislatures depend on the vote banks that the illegal migrants form as soon as they enter India. Maybe Banerjee should have appreciated this too.

 Yours faithfully,

Balram Misra, New Delhi

 Sir ? This was not first time that Mamata Banerjee has behaved outrageously inside parliament. Once she had thrown her shawl at P.A. Sangma, the then speaker, and sat on a dharna inside the house. Maybe it is part of her political gameplan, but it is hardly good for parliamentary democracy. She has been seen on television repeatedly, throwing a sheaf of papers at the chair. It is true that she was not allowed to speak on illegal migration of Bangladeshis into West Bengal or irregularities in the state voters? list, but she must have known that the issues were raised earlier in the house. Putting in her papers seems to be another ploy because she surely knew that a scribbled note on a piece of paper would not be accepted. Banerjee must change her ways, or there will be no place for her in a democracy.

 Yours faithfully,

B.K. Chatterjee, Faridabad

 Sir ? Was Mamata Banerjee even aware of what she was doing in the Lok Sabha on Thursday, August 4? She should consider taking leave from politics for some time and return with a saner approach to the world, and in particular, to parliament. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Sir ? Our president, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, has a vision, which he calls Vision 2020. He is certain that by 2020, India will be a world leader. His aspirations are based on the superior talent displayed by our youth in technology-related fields. But discipline, I am afraid, is more important than technical skills for the progress of a nation, and India seems to be woefully lacking in this area. What could be more illustrative of this than the way Mamata Banerjee threw some papers at the presiding officer of the Lok Sabha. If the leaders behave like this, what can be expected of the masses? Somnath Chatterjee, the Lok Sabha speaker remarked some time back that the lower house has become a laughing stock. However, in these perilous times, the nation must be thankful to its elected representatives for providing it with something to laugh at.

 Yours faithfully,

C.V.K. Moorthy, Calcutta

 Sir ? If Mamata Banerjee has a problem, it is her temper. Why did she allow herself to get so upset at a simple refusal? Yes, the issue she wanted to raise has important implications for our national security at a time when Bangladesh is emerging as an important centre of Islamist terrorism. Perhaps she should have been given an out-of-turn chance. But she shouldn?t have lost her cool.

 Yours faithfully,

J. Akshobhya, Mysore

 Sir ? Unruly behaviour is not unheard of in Indian parliamentary history, but in the past instances, it has been the men who have indulged in hurling abuses and furniture at one another. For some reason, when a woman is seen behaving in an unparliamentary manner, it has had an extremely disturbing effect on the viewers and the electorate. 

 Somnath Chatterjee is quite correct in not accepting Banerjee?s resignation. A quiet apology from the fiery Trinamool MP would be enough to lay the matter to rest, but right now, she seems to be looking for some disquiet.

 Yours faithfully,

Sumant Poddar, Calcutta

 SAFETY NOT A CONCERN

 Malvika Singh

 Roads and highways have become death traps. With a boom in the automobile industry, there has been a boom in accidents (sic) because of the callous manner in which licences are doled out to all and sundry without adequate tests, because the traffic police do not enforce the law, and bribery, corruption and drunken driving rule the streets. No one seems concerned enough to make the corrective, to demand accountability from the police or any other authority. The collection of hafta by the authority from those breaking the rules is normal. You can see it as you drive about the city or cross the border into another state. 

 Every Indian knows this truth and has learned to live with it. The government has done nothing to stop it. The administration of civil society, the safety of citizens, as well as law and order are in supreme denial. It is sad, but dangerous too, that the rulers have failed to keep India safe and protected. They are turning a blind eye to all horrors as the ?forces? keep them safe at the cost of the people. 

 Lawless progress

 Without complete transparency and accountability, a modern, civilized society cannot exist and in India, alas, both are sorely lacking. The state and its authority override all good sense and honesty. The exploitation by the state and its many devious arms of straight and upright citizens who refuse to participate in corrupt practices is rampant. Young people doing their jobs as they should, with integrity, are shot dead at point blank range and the system allows the killers to roam free. I am referring to the IOC employee in Uttar Pradesh. The prime minister should address this problem of civil society, law and order first because without that social stability, no other advance is possible. Anarchy will definitely prevail despite all the rising economic indicators. 

 Another example of this problem is the upward swing in the real estate business where a lack of intelligent norms and necessary infrastructure is making living in ?fancy? new environs impossible. As the groundwater table shrinks, many of these suburban townships will have to be abandoned. Concrete ghost towns will be left for posterity. Thousands will be reduced to penury and chaos will take over. The state has failed. In almost all areas of organized economic activity, the entrepreneurship and energy of Indians have overtaken the input of the state as well as its responsibility. 

 Courting disaster

 The government has become inept to the point of total non-governance. Whenever a crisis hits, an ?internal inquiry? is ordered by the prime minister or whoever is concerned and a cover-up ensues where the babus, predictably, whitewash the truth and protect each other. The country continues to be brutalized as it rots and descends into being a fourth rate republic. This coterie of people, who have destroyed a vibrant nation, must be made accountable and hauled over the coals. The governance of India is hollow, with ?commissions? being used as tools to cover up the corruption of administration. 

 As a last-ditch attempt, the judiciary seems to have taken over the responsibility that should rest with the executive. Very dicey, beyond a point, for a democracy. If the judiciary too becomes corrupt, that will be the end of India as a federal, democratic republic. Our ruling class and the ?privileged? have perpetuated this deterioration in our society and have brought a great civilization to its knees. It is a huge crime to have tampered with a fine social fabric. All ancient civilizations have been destroyed by their greedy leaders, from Mesopotamia to Hindustan. Large populations are unsuspecting victims of this type of ?holocaust?. It is difficult to comprehend that our leaders, individuals like you and me, can be so unrelenting in their denial of the reality of India.

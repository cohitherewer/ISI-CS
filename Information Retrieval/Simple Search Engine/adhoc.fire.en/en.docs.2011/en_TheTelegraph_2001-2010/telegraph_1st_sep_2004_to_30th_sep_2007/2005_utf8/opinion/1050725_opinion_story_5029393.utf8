 SCREAM IN TIME

 An attitude problem combined with incompetence can produce pure black comedy. There is no other way to describe the list of instructions the Delhi police have produced to ensure that women are safe on the city streets. Abduction and gangrape have become horrifyingly common, and women are vulnerable to attack whether they are going for a meal, buying medicines, crossing the road, or sitting on the roadside to relieve themselves. In the most recent such incident, a woman was abducted and raped in a moving car. This was the second such incident within a few months. Although the police had been told of the abduction almost immediately, they dithered over the precise station at which the complaint should be registered. The search began three hours later. Their advice to women is simple. When attacked, they should scream at the top of their voices. No civilized form of security is to be expected. The best weapon is primeval, the woman?s voice. The police might be asked whether they think that women do not scream, or try to. And whether they think, in the unsounded depths of their idiocy, that force, exerted by more than one man, with, possibly, the hand-clamped-over-the-mouth routine, the feel or sight of a knife or gun, sheer shock, surprise, a desperate struggle and so on, might in some way affect their powers of screaming. Women should also always carry mobile phones, evidently even those who need to go out of their houses to relieve themselves, and must avoid deserted roads. 

 There are other helpful suggestions too. If a woman is unnerved by the behaviour of a man at a lonely bus stop in the evening, she should run into the nearest house. She should, though, check before running that the house is lit. Such absurdities could be embroidered upon to delightful effect had the issue not been so urgent and so frightening. Lecturing women and neatly passing the onus of their protection on to them is a poor cover for staggering incompetence. But it is indifference too. The attitude revealed in the series of instructions that sounds like a do-it-yourself kit for the mentally challenged is a primped-up version of the same arguments which insist that if a woman is raped she asked for it, if she thinks she can go about like a man she deserves all she gets, and if she is so emancipated what is she complaining about anyway?

 SMALLER STATES, HAPPIER PEOPLE

 XAVIER P. MAO

 The indefinite economic blockade launched by the All Naga Students Association of Manipur against the state government?s decision to declare June 18 as State Integrity Day has snowballed into a fight for integration of contiguous Naga-inhabited areas. But the root of the problem is yet to be reviewed. 

 The desire of ethnic, linguistic and religious communities to live together may be as old as mankind, but it has become more pronounced in the modern age. The democratic and political value of individual dignity, that the individual and the community should be left alone to decide their fate, has been recognized in this age. This is not peculiar to India; the demand of the Nagas to live together in a Nagalim is the manifestation of such a universal aspiration.

 A.Z. Phizo was the first one to make the statement that Nagaland became a part of India neither by conquest nor by consent, but was annexed to India. Phizo believed that the Indian government had forcibly occupied Nagaland, and must vacate it. Leaders like Subhas Chandra Bose and M.K. Gandhi acknowledged that Nagas are ethnically and culturally different from Indians. 

 Constitution says

 With time, however, the Nagas have softened their stand. The idea of a sovereign and independent Nagaland outside India and the Indian constitution has been all but given up. This is the most opportune moment for the Centre to solve the six-decade-old Naga problem. But the neighbouring states of Nagaland must cooperate. 

 The Nagas want the integration of Naga-inhabited areas of the adjoining states to be integrated with Nagaland. Article 3 of the Constitution provides for the alteration of areas and boundaries for the formation of new states. But Manipur, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh have not been able so far to appreciate the true import of this. 

 It has also been said that any integration of Naga-inhabited areas is sure to result in ?bloodbath? in the whole of the North-east. But what India needs today is smaller states, and before there is popular demand for them, the government should implement this idea. It took ages for Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Uttaranchal to be separate states. Now it is the turn of Telengana, Vidarbha, Gorkhaland and Bodoland? 

 Centre cannot hold

 It is on record that the Nagas in Manipur are being exploited and discriminated by the majority Manipuris (Meiteis). No visible development work has been undertaken in the Naga-inhabited areas of Manipur. The Nagas have also been discriminated against in matters of employment and admission to professional colleges. The apprehension that after the four Naga-inhabited areas of Manipur are merged with Nagaland, Manipur will be pauperized has no basis whatsoever. If anything, the Central assistance to Manipur will be reduced in case of a split, but it will be proportionate to the population.

 Laloo Prasad Yadav had once said that Jharkhand would come over his dead body, but that did not stop the state from coming into existence. It is true that hundreds of tribes, sub-tribes and ethnic groups in the North-east are demanding either separate states or autonomous areas. The Karbis, Dimasas and other small groups are demanding separate states from the government of Assam, which is not willing to acquiesce. But this kind of recalcitrance of a democratic government is worrying. Politics is the art of the possible and there cannot be a fixed agenda for all time to come. 

 The Centre should not delay the merging of Naga-inhabited areas with Nagaland. Neither should it fight shy of granting independent statehood or autonomy to ethnic groups in the North-east, if they so want.

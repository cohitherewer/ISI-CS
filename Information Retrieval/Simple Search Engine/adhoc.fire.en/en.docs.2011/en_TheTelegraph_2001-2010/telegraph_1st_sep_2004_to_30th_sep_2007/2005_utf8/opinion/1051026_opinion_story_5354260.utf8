 TO DOUSE THE RAGING FOREST FIRE 

 Instead of shelving the tribal bill, 

 legislators can rework it to reconcile tribals? claims to 

 justice with the nation?s ecological concerns, writes Mahesh 

 Rangarajan

 Live and let live 

 Few issues have polarized the 

 articulate sections of the media as the proposed tribal 

 bill has. It is difficult to think of any issue related 

 to conservation that has revealed such a deep divide between 

 advocates of adivasi land rights and those who favour 

 continued retention of the lands they claim to be under 

 the control of the forest department. 

 For a while earlier this year, 

 the bill met with immovable obstacles. Strong criticism 

 by a section of the conservationists led to a rethink on 

 the part of the Union government. The ministry of tribal 

 affairs went so far as to solicit opinions from across the 

 country. 

 For a while it looked as if the 

 measure would be put on the back- burner. Among the critics 

 was the Indian forest service, which is charged with administering 

 23 per cent of the country?s land area. It is not keen to 

 see any diminution of the area under its control. A second 

 critical group consists of urban conservationists anxious 

 to keep the forest cover and wildlife intact, but all too 

 ready to see the forest department as the sole agency capable 

 of executing such a vision. 

 But now there are signs of change. 

 The pressure is telling on the ruling United Progressive 

 Alliance legislators. Many have also been stung by the composition 

 of the Tiger and Wilderness Forum, which had disproportionate 

 numbers of MPs from former princely families. And as many 

 would know, most princes were once avid big-game hunters 

 themselves. Madhav Maharaj of Gwalior, whose descendants 

 are active in the two largest political parties, personally 

 shot dead as many as seven hundred tigers. 

 It is all too natural that the 

 intervention of public figures from such a background would 

 not be looked upon kindly by descendants of commoners. Freedom 

 fighters like Hare Krishna Mahtab have exposed the inhuman 

 forced labour involved in the princely hunts. 

 In fact, the Tiger and Wilderness 

 Forum?s own meeting in April was followed by some careful 

 words from the chairman, Karan Singh, who clarified that 

 the forum had nothing against tribal rights and only sought 

 to reconcile these with the objectives of conservation. 

 It is a matter of public record 

 that Karan Singh was Union health minister during the Emergency 

 and was also chairman of the steering committee of Project 

 Tiger. No one who knows the political history of north India 

 needs to be told how the public policies he piloted damaged 

 civic life and even the public image of Indira Gandhi. Be 

 that as it may, it is notable that a far larger number of 

 MPs from reserved constituencies publicly spoke out for 

 such a measure. 

 The proponents of the tribal bill 

 have as allies not merely populist politicians or advocates 

 of adivasi rights, but even a significant section of the 

 environmental movement. The latter are not always figures 

 or groups who endorse the bill in its present form. They 

 are elements that seek to give equal importance to biological 

 diversity and landscape integrity but are also working overtime 

 to reconcile these with the livelihood needs of the rural 

 poor. 

 These would include two innovative 

 initiatives. One is the tiger task force report that endorses 

 the idea of one per cent of the land mass of India being 

 made totally inviolate from any exploitative activity. The 

 other is a less well- known but no less important report 

 gathering dust in the ministry of environment and forests 

 ? the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan. The 

 latter calls for as much as 60,000 square kilometres to 

 be made free of human habitation and presence.

 Both these reports are unique 

 as their preparation entails large-scale consolidations 

 away from the urban metropolises, among forest users and 

 residents. Neither endorses the kind of summary evictions 

 and clearance that pass in the name of conservation. Both 

 call for a consensual approach that enables anyone who has 

 to move to get a better deal and a new life. 

 Yet the media has played no small 

 role in drowning out sane voices. The entire issue has been 

 posed as if adivasis are the major source of deforestation 

 and denudation. Even a cursory look at the single largest 

 factor for the loss of forests, namely the expansion of 

 cultivated arable land, will belie such a claim. Adivasis, 

 who make up around 8 out of 100 Indians, own the least land. 

 Among the more bizarre claims 

 by opponents of the bill has been the suggestion that it 

 seeks to divide and distribute all forestlands to land-hungry 

 scheduled tribes. Not only is this a misrepresentation, 

 if there is any, it fails to recognize the core principle 

 on which the bill is founded. 

 Cultivators are already in occupation 

 of such lands and have already cleared the forest. All that 

 the bill seeks to do is give occupants the status of owners. 

 Further, the Movement for Dignity and Livelihood has agreed 

 to limit all claims to those whose presence predates 1980. 

 They are a set of occupiers who have had a presence for 

 a quarter of a century. 

 Such a regularization of tenure 

 would make sense in terms of natural justice if nothing 

 else. But it does raise other troubling questions, both 

 in terms of implementation and ecological consequences. 

 These can indeed be resolved by reworking the bill instead 

 of shelving it. The issue of justice is simple enough and 

 has been raised by groups such as the Jan Sangharsh Morcha 

 in central India. Setting 1980 as a cut-off date imperils 

 all those who came in later. Many of the latter are ?ecological 

 refugees?. They have fled from the mega dams, mines, roads 

 and other projects that have displaced them. 

 One possible answer is to adopt 

 the Madhya Pradesh government?s model of recognizing the 

 rights of all those who predate a notification by one year. 

 Such families should, at the least, have a guarantee of 

 a better deal, including rights on fertile arable land, 

 jobs and just compensation. Of special concern are those 

 given land right documents or pattas by the revenue 

 department itself.

 This issue has also found echo 

 in the recent public stand taken by the Communist Party 

 of India (Marxist). What may well be necessary is a comprehensive 

 settlement of all rights, which in turn will require a fresh 

 survey. 

 The second issue is that of national 

 parks and sanctuaries. The former, in particular, cover 

 barely 30,000 square km. There are also critical wildlife 

 corridors where the presence of large mammals like elephants 

 and tigers would make life conflict-ridden for any settlers, 

 adivasi or not.

 Here, the tiger task force?s idea 

 of just and transparent relocation is a possibility. This 

 is critical for sound biological reasons. Keeping a small 

 part of the landscape with its plant and animal life intact 

 makes eminent sense in an age when their scientific significance 

 grows more evident by the day. 

 Such specific issues of justice 

 and biological integrity need serious debate. The issue 

 is not of adivasi land claims versus forest survival. 

 It is one of reconciling adivasi claims of justice in a 

 manner consonant with ecological concerns. Opponents of 

 the bill do these issues no justice if they are sanguine 

 about a government department?s ability to address such 

 issues. Supporters need to address biological concerns. 

 A revamped bill that strikes a balance can prove to be a 

 new beginning for the forests, as much as adivasi India.

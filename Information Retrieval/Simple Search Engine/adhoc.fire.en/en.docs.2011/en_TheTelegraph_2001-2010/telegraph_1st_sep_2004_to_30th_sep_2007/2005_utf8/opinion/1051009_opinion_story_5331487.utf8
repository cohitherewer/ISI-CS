 SELF AND ILLUSION

 Self-perception is not always the best perception. Neither are stereotypes always true. One recent survey revealed that Indians think of themselves as being unconventional and open. But a measurement of Indian personality traits showed that Indians are more conventional than any other culture that was analysed in the study. This may be seen as an index of self-delusion of Indians. But that may be too facile and too harsh a conclusion. Americans see themselves as being typically very assertive and aggressive, and Canadians believe that they are a submissive lot. But the survey showed that both Americans and Canadians have similar scores on assertiveness. The Americans obviously have an exaggerated notion of their aggressiveness, and the Canadians underestimate the aggression they display. The Czechs have terrible ideas about themselves. They feel that they are disagreeable and combative. But the survey brought out that they are actually altruistic and modest. It is possible, of course, to argue that self-perception and the ?scientific? measurement of personality traits are both inadequate yardsticks for understanding as volatile and as varied entities as human beings.

 It is possible also to raise the even more fundamental question about ?national character?. Is it possible to arrive at an acceptable definition of national character? In a country as vast as India, with so many different cultures and communities, any generalization appears to be invalid. It takes one Mr Manmohan Singh to invalidate all the absurd jokes that have been made about sardars. Just as it takes the brilliance of Oscar Wilde and James Joyce to take the punch off the cracks made at the expense of Irishmen. The Scottish author, George Macdonald Fraser, has spun a series of stories around the later life of Harry Flashman, the bully in Tom Brown?s Schooldays, to explode the myth of the typical brave and honourable English gentleman of Victorian times. The man on the number 11 bus going to his office in the City may not remotely resemble either John Bull or Colonel Blimp. The Indian politician wearing the Gandhi cap is in no way similar to Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi who never sported such headgear. National stereotypes are inevitably caricatures of the original.

 Yet it is not possible to throw out either self-perception or generalizations about national character. It is possible that Mr George W. Bush behaves the way he does because he believes Americans are always assertive; and the Bengali cowers in fear because the cowardly babu has been a stereotype going back to the 19th century. Males are macho because it is typical of them, and women submissive because they have internalized the role that Indian society has imposed on them. Both stereotypes and self-perception are cultural products and yet they vary. That is the wonder of it.

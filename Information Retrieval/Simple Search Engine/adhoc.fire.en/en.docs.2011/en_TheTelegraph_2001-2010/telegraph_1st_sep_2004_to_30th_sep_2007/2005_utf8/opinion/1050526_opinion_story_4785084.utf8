 NOT PROPER

 Political rhetoric, by its very nature, blurs the distinction between assessment and abuse. The Bharatiya Janata Party-led opposition set out to make an assessment of the United Progressive Alliance government?s first year in office. But what it produced was nothing more than a diatribe against Mr Manmohan Singh and Ms Sonia Gandhi. This is somewhat characteristic of the BJP. Its criticisms descend to abuse just as its shows of dissent descend to disruption. Who wields the real power in the UPA is a question that is distinct from how the UPA has performed in the first year of its existence. It is difficult to understand how experienced leaders like Mr L.K. Advani cannot appreciate this simple distinction. The assessment of the UPA, adverse, indifferent or favourable, must be based on some kind of evaluation of the policies that have been pursued and the impact of those policies. The BJP?s assessment does not address the question of policies, rather it focuses on personalities. The BJP in its wisdom believes that Ms Gandhi and not Mr Singh masterminds all the decisions in the UPA. It is welcome to this belief. But a reiteration of this belief cannot pass as an assessment of the UPA. The limelight on Ms Gandhi only underlines the opposition?s inability to separate the government from the party. Ms Gandhi leads the party and Mr Singh heads the government. To make its point, the BJP-led opposition needed to show that on all crucial matters the leader of the party has prevailed over the head of the government. The BJP has assumed as given what needed to be proved. This has made its assessment nothing more than a tissue of abuse against Mr Singh.

 If the BJP has failed to make an assessment, it has failed to perform its duties as the principal opposition party in the Lok Sabha. It stayed away from parliament even when legislations initiated during its own time in power were being discussed. Even Mr Advani in his speech to the Confederation of Indian Industries had to admit that this may not have been the best thing to have done under the circumstances. Political parties, when they are in opposition, concentrate on scoring cheap points over their rivals instead of devoting attention to issues of substance and to constructive criticism. This is true of all the parties: the BJP-led opposition?s so-called assessment of the UPA only highlights this.

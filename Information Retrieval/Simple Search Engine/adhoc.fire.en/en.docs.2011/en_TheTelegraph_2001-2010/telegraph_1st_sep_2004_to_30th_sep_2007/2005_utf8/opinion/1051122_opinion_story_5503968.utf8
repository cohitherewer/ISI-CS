 WRONG STRATEGY

 In the hands of cynical people politics can be frightening business. The Congress?s show of solidarity with Mr Adhir Chowdhury could have led to horrible deaths for some bus passengers in Calcutta. The young activists of the party who set fire to the bus and sought to forcibly prevent the passengers from getting off it, exposed the ugliest face of Indian politics. The incident proves once more that such politicians think nothing of sacrificing innocent lives at the altar of their little party games. Mr Chowdhury or his party is certainly not alone in inciting such evil ways of political mobilization. Only a few weeks ago, the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) put up a similar show of strength over the arrest of the former minister, Mr Narayan Biswas. That it did not turn violent was more a matter of political strategy than of concern for public safety. Such political actions are both a show of strength and a dangerous show of contempt for the law. Mr Chowdhury and Mr Biswas both evaded the law after arrest warrants had been issued against them. After what these parties have done, it would be na?ve to trust their leaders? protestations of their faith in the rule of law.

 However, the larger fear must relate to the state?s failures. Politicians become laws unto themselves only in situations where the state fails to keep its constitutional obligations. If the common people rally round such leaders out of fear, that is because they get no protection or justice from the state. Once again, the CPI(M) must take the blame for this larger failure. Its long reign over Bengal has seen most police stations function as extensions of the local party offices. Wherever they can, the opposition parties such as the Congress and the Trinamool Congress tread the same path. And, they seek to justify their acts by arguing that muscle power remains their only option for fighting the CPI(M). In fact, Congressmen would like to see in Mr Chowdhury?s arrest an opportunity for the party?s comeback to the centrestage of Bengal?s politics. The assembly elections next year make it the right time for a revival strategy. But violent street battles by unruly party cadre are the stuff of old politics; they may not add up to a winning strategy.

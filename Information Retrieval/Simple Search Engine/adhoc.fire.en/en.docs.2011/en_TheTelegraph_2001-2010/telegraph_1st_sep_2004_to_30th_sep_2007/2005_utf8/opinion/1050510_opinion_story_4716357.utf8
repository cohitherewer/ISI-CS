 IF YOU ARE THINKING WHAT WE?RE THINKING

 ANOTHER VOICE

 How to protect the homeland from the envy of less happy lands

 Michael Howard

 Many years ago, I read a poem called ?The Ambiguous Fate of Gieve Patel, He being neither Muslim nor Hindu in India?. The poem suggested that the author couldn?t, as a Parsi, distance himself from the hatred around him. Like Patel, despite being neither an asylum-seeker nor an immigrant, I live as a foreigner in an atmosphere that is hostile. I have met many genuinely liberal and friendly Swiss people. Yet, as in India, the ?chattering classes? will be dismissed for being out of touch with the ?real people?.

 Soon after I moved to Switzerland, I read a newsletter that said, ?The Swiss welcome foreigners, at least those who come from rich countries.? Bad news, Indians. For all your boasts about being the second-fastest growing economy in the world, the Swiss don?t really like us. Last month, I went out with two women, one a friend, the other a stranger. We had coffee together but as soon as I left, the other woman turned to my friend and asked in a whisper, ?Is she an asylum-seeker?? My teenage son tells me that it?s a routine question on the trams and he seems to find it less offensive than I did. 

 At least you have to give it to the British National Party. Its manifesto states boldly that it would, if it came to power, organize the ?voluntary repatriation? of all immigrants to their land of origin, withdraw British troops from Iraq and introduce military conscription. And the armed forces? Why, send them to guard the channel, thus ensuring the further protection of ?this fortress, built by nature for itself, against infection?. And, of course, foreigners do bring AIDS?

 Nick Griffin naturally resents the way the unctuous Michael Howard has insinuated his way into his territory with the sinister message, ?Are you thinking what we?re thinking?? The implication is that we?re thinking what the demon of political correctness will not allow us to utter. It is interesting that Howard himself is the son of legal migrants from Romania. He has been the ideal immigrant ? sending his son to Eton, raising his children as Christians (his son is a clergyman), and clearly acquiring all the attributes of a conservative Conservative. 

 The move towards the centre imparts a certain respectability to the cause. Years ago, when Sikhs were burnt alive in many parts of India, Girilal Jain wrote about Sikhs being seen to distribute laddoos to celebrate Indira Gandhi?s death, and used it as some kind of an explanation for the killings that followed.

 Two years ago, a Swiss organization launched a campaign to confront the stereotypes about different minority groups in Switzerland. So a drawing of a long-nosed and sallow man was emblazoned with the slogan, ?How did the Jew get his money?? ?By hard work, like anyone else,? said the next line. There were other questions. ?Why does the Tamil go to the restaurant?? ? ?To eat, like anyone else?. ?Why does the Turk carry a garbage bag? ? ?To throw out his rubbish, like anyone else? and ?What does the Thai woman do at night?? ??She sleeps, like anyone else?. So there it was, neatly summed up, Jews are rich, Tamils work in restaurants, Turks collect garbage and Thai women are prostitutes. Are you thinking what we think you?re thinking? Some thought the campaign too close for comfort and the billboards were taken down, but not before inspiring one more parody, ?Why does the Albanian carry a knife??

 Last year, the right-wing Swiss National Party, led by the indefatigable Christophe Blocher, pasted the German-speaking parts of Switzerland with posters exhorting people to vote negatively in a referendum on whether to make the granting of citizenship to second and third-generation immigrants slightly easier. The Blocher campaign also featured Osama bin Laden on a poster with the suggestion that he could become a Swiss if the liberals had their way. The irony is that bin Laden?s brother is Swiss and lives in luxury in Geneva.

 And that brings us to the distinction between the very few, seriously wealthy foreigners who are welcome and the great unwashed who are not. At least, Nick Griffin and the British National Party want to throw out the lot. And when they?ve withdrawn from Europe and brought their troops home, they can all live together on their isle, with the sea to defend them against the envy of less happy lands.

 Letters to Editor

 Inglorious company

 Sir ? Kofi Annan?s persecution has reached ridiculous proportions, and all because he refused to fall in line with America?s aggrandizing policy on Iraq (?Annan sought job for son: Report?, March 31). Annan may have taken advantage of his position to promote his son?s career, but which powerful man doesn?t? Can George Bush Sr. swear that he has never tried to push his son? It is not that only the company which employed Kojo Annan got a good deal in Iraq. What about those which have gained from their closeness with the Bushes?

 Yours faithfully,

K. Mohanty, Calcutta

 No woman?s land

 Sir ? The editorial, ?Unacceptable? (March 30), on the refusal of permanent citizenship rights to Taslima Nasreen, exposes the hypocrisy of the state and Central governments, as also their cowardice. They have undermined the great Indian tradition of providing hospitality to those who genuinely seek and need refuge. But India?s comparison with the liberal attitude of Britain to asylum-seekers is a bit stretched. In India, petty concerns, like keeping the vote bank intact, powerfully influence governments. What they fail to realize is that in the world beyond India?s borders, Nasreen will be remembered and revered for her lone fight against religious fanatics. 

 Yours faithfully,

Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

 Sir ? The West Bengal government has wisely withheld its consent regarding Taslima Nasreen?s citizenship. Nasreen has achieved notoriety by vilifying certain sections in Bangladesh, where her writings have caused a serious law and order problem. She has given enough reason for the government to believe that she could stir a hornet?s nest in India. The right wing would be ever-willing to exploit the circumstances. All peace-loving citizens should endeavour to dissuade the authorities from granting her citizenship. West Bengal cannot be allowed to become another Gujarat. Moreover, the grant of citizenship to a persona non grata like Nasreen also has the potential of souring relations with our eastern neighbour, especially at a time when India is trying to improve its ties with Bangladesh. Having spent most of her exiled life in Europe, Nasreen must have realized that the Continent lacks rabble-rousers, of which there is no dearth in India. 

 Yours faithfully,

Iqbal Ahmed, Calcutta

 Sir ? Instead of debating the issue in the media, it is prudent to leave the decision of granting citizenship rights to Taslima Nasreen to the Indian government. Nasreen has been unequivocal in her diatribe against both Hindus and Muslims. By granting her citizenship, the government may be inviting the wrath of both the communities. India is undoubtedly a land which respects freedom of speech and expression, but in the present volatile situation the government has done the right thing by denying her citizenship.

 Yours faithfully

Siddhartha Raj Guha, Jabalpur

 Sir ? The refusal to grant Taslima Nasreen citizenship is going to bother two sections of Indians. One, those fighting religious fundamentalism. And second, an entire generation of Bengalis who have grown up on fond memories handed down by their grandparents and parents of their land of birth. The second group is away from Bangladesh for more or less the same reasons that Taslima Nasreen can no more enter Bangladesh. Intellectual, creative and religious freedom has been a way of life in India ? aberrations notwithstanding ? and Calcutta is the natural home to Nasreen. The Indian government should reconsider its decision.

 Yours faithfully,

Anindita Guha, Calcutta

 BEAR CHASING BULL

 Dipankar Bose

 ?Speculators may do no harm as bubbles on a steady stream of enterprise. But the position is serious when enterprise becomes the bubble on a whirlpool of speculation.? Thus wrote J.M. Keynes in the early Thirties. Things have not changed much since. In the Bombay stock exchange, the Sensex rises sharply, only to fall just as sharply. Though the market seems to have settled down at around 7,000 lately, as recently as April 15, 2005 the Sensex fell 220 points, followed by another 100-odd points on April 18. Earlier, from a low of 2,924 on April 5, 2003 it had climbed to 6,194 on January 14, 2004 only to fall to 4,505 on May 17 that year, before rising again to 6,679 on January 3, 2005.

 Such wild fluctuations show that since ?expectations? can behave so erratically, they must lack substance. After all, the ?fundamentals? on which they are based did not change much. Also, some unusually strong movements must be influencing the market.

 Foreign institutional investors have raised their net equity purchases from $753 million in 2002 to $6.6 billion in 2003 to $8.5 billion in 2004. This sudden FII interest in our equity markets explains the medium-term buoyancy in the stock exchange in 2003-?04.

 Artificial high

 According to a recent study, the average FII holdings in the 30 companies included in the Sensex was 19 per cent. It varied from a low of 2.52 per cent in Wipro to a high of 49 per cent in ICICI Bank. In case the FIIs decide to move out of a stock at any time, a collapse in its share price would be inevitable. 

 The Indian equity market is shallow, that is, stocks of only a few companies are actively traded. The effects of FII activities are, thus, exaggerated because retail investors tend to follow FIIs unthinkingly. Hence, any rise in FII investments triggers a sharp rise in stock prices, providing added incentive for further inflows. This leads to a price spiral that lacks an effective correcting mechanism, because price/earning ratios play a minor role in determining share prices. A correction can be brought about only by FIIs offloading, which may result in a crash. 

 The power that the FIIs wield over the markets can have serious repercussions. FIIs are multinationals, and take their decisions on the basis of a host of factors. So, even the expectation of a change in any political or economic parameter abroad can affect their investments in the Indian markets. 

 Danger signals

 The shallowness of the Indian market encourages speculation by the FIIs. On May 17, 2004, the market crashed by over 800 points when UBS Securities sold securities worth Rs 188.35 crore ? 3 per cent of the traded value for that day. 

 In the name of globalization we have embarked on indiscriminate financial liberalization. In October 2000, banks were allowed to raised their investment in the stock markets from 5 per cent of the incremental deposit to 5 per cent of total outstanding credit, making a huge difference in the level of such investments. Thus, a slump in the markets can seriously affect the banking sector. And, this is exactly what happened when the Nedungadi Bank had to be closed (through a merger with Punjab National Bank) thanks to its over-exposure to the equity market.

 Recently, LIC, which already has 8 or 9 per cent of its investible funds in the markets, has been permitted to raise its exposure. The Centre is trying to pass the pension reforms bill in parliament in the coming monsoon session. Even banks are now offering personal loans for buying shares.

 The question is, do we need FII funds now that our foreign exchange reserves are comfortable? After all, these funds are concerned only with the secondary market. Also, why do we need to shore up the Sen- sex at all?

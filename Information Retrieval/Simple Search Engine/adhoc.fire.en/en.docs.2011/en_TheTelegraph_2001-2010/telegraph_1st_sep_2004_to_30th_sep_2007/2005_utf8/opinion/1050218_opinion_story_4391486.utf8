 WRONG NOTE

 Scoring debating points is not exactly the idea behind peace initiatives. Peace in Assam cannot, therefore, be a matter of how the rebels define the concept of ?sovereignty?. It is one thing for the United Liberation Front of Asom to demand that New Delhi discuss its idea of a sovereign Assam and quite another to pin all hopes of peace on that single argument. It should be a hopeful sign that the ULFA has at last agreed to talk to the Centre. This is a step forward from its earlier refusal to give peace a chance. But to suggest that the only issue worth discussing is the rebels? demand for the sovereignty of Assam is to start the talks on a wrong note. To do so would inevitably put a question-mark on the ULFA?s real intentions. For it cannot be unaware of New Delhi?s consistent stand that the integrity of any part of India is not negotiable. Peace talks with insurgents anywhere in the country can be meaningful only if this fundamental principle is not violated. Once this is taken care of, it is easier to talk in an atmosphere of mutual trust. 

 It is important not to miss the shift in the Centre?s position as well. Earlier, it would not concede any demand that bordered on a compromise with the country?s ?sovereignty?. But the response from the prime minister?s office to the letter by the ULFA chairman, Mr Arabinda Rajkhowa, marks a significant shift. The Centre is now willing to discuss the demand for ?sovereignty? along with other relevant issues relating to the ULFA?s rebellion. New Delhi?s talks with the Naga rebels have survived the latter?s insistence on a ?sovereign? Nagaland. The two sides have differing views on this and several other issues. But the differences have not spoilt the ceasefire in Nagaland. In Assam, too, a ceasefire between the government and the Bodo rebels has held despite differences on crucial issues. While it awaits a debate on the issue of sovereignty, the ULFA would do well to respond to the government?s offer of a ceasefire. Such a gesture would dramatically change the atmosphere even before the talks begin. It would be na?ve to expect an early end to an insurgency that has bled Assam for more than twenty-five years. This is the ULFA?s first major opportunity to gain through talks what it can never hope to achieve with the guns. Peace could give Assam much more than an economic package. But only a realistic approach can make the talks meaningful.

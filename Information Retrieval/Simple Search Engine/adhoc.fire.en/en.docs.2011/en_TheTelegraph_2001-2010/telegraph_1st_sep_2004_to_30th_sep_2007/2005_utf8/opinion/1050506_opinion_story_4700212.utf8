 OUT OF THE DARKNESS

 Song of a river

 Mad About The Mekong: Exploration and Empire in South-East Asia 

 By John Keay, 

 HarperCollins, ? 13.50

 Imperialism has become discredited today. But the history of imperialism is full of intrepid adventurers who pitted their wits and strength against insuperable difficulties in their zeal to discover new worlds. Whatever be the political uses to which the knowledge they revealed was later put, there?s no denying the drama and romance of their journeys of discovery. David Livingstone and H.M. Stanley?s exploration of the Congo come to mind. But with this book, John Keay claims for the Mekong Exploration Commission, 1866-68, the right to be remembered in the same breath. At any rate, he wants to rescue the commission from being forgotten as a result of the inexplicable French disregard for its achievements.

 Keay writes an engaging prose which brings alive the drama of the venture. At a human level, the drama lies in the relationship between its six principal members, especially its commandant, the cautious Doudart de Lagr?e, and his impetuous deputy, Francis Garnier. The conflict between the two over whether they should follow the river upto its source in Tibet, or make for China (once they had established that large parts of it were impassable for most of the year) accounts for the expedition?s meandering path into China, north of the Tang-ho rapids. 

 At the political level, the drama is provided by how the expedition shaped France?s imperial designs. The expedition?s main business was the reconnaissance of the middle and upper reaches of the Mekong to see whether France could get a toehold in south-east Asia, and thus counter the English presence in these parts. This it did very well. It came up with so many arguments ? moral, economic, strategic, archaeological ? in favour of French acquisitions in the area that within 40 years of the expedition, Garnier?s dream of a French Indo-China, comprising Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, was a reality. 

 Keay does not end there. One suspects that it is as much the sensational history of the area after the French departed, as the adventures of the expedition itself, that attracted him to the Mekong. And it is a singularly violent history ? the US-sponsored wars in Laos and Cambodia, the communist-capitalist face-off in Vietnam, the opium wars and drug-related clashes in the Golden Triangle, and Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge?s reign of terror being only the best-known instances. Keay sees in all this a measure of the failure, and indeed futility, of French imperial designs. But this is to read backwards ? who knows how the combination of the region?s isolation, its disparate ethnic tribes and its inhospitable terrain would have shaped its history had not the French come into the picture?

 There is also Keay?s slightly fanciful persistence in looking at the Mekong in the light of Conrad?s Heart of Darkness. Taking on the idea from Francis Ford Coppola?s version of Conrad, Apocalypse Now, where he substitutes the Mekong for the Congo, Keay sees in the river the blurring of the forces of good and evil, of Western man being pushed to the limits, and beyond, of civilization by inscrutable Easterners. The Mekong is full of treacherous rapids, its course is unpredictable, and at times it is deep enough to boggle the imagination ? but to see in it the ?obvious setting for a visionary parable of damnation in the late twentieth century? is a bit much.

 DARK AT NOON

 The London fog was part of the atmosphere that added to the lure of the Sherlock Holmes stories. The past tense is used deliberately since that fog no longer exists. But the fog that envelops Delhi every winter is part of the capital?s present and its wintry gloom. This weekend was typical. Flights were non-operational because aircraft could not land or take-off from the airport, especially the domestic one. The situation is a ludicrous one. Here is India straining against the leash to become a world power and a global economic player, yet come every December, the fog cuts off India?s capital city from the rest of the country and the world. Even when flights can land or take-off, a two-to-three hour delay is considered par for the course in Delhi during the winter months. There is no indication that any steps have been taken to remedy this situation. In fact, the common impression is that every year the situation is deteriorating from the previous year. There are reports that the instrumental landing system at the Delhi airport has been upgraded to meet international standards. But, apparently, very few pilots in India are trained to handle this system. Poor visibility thus brings traffic to a halt at the Delhi airport.

 But there is more to the situation than the inability to use up-to-date technology. The fog has something to do with environmental pollution in Delhi which continues to be bad despite the introduction of public transport run on CNG. The administration needs to look into this matter very seriously. Another aspect that needs attention and resources is the use of science and technology to make timebound forecasts about fogs that allow more lead time for rescheduling flights. In India, research and predictions regarding the weather emanate from the Indian Meteorological Department. There is no logic in keeping this within the sole ambit of the government. Not even the paranoid can claim that the weather has ?security considerations?. Opening up this research will bring in more resources and greater initiative. Indian agriculture ? and thus transitively the Indian economy ? has been described as a gamble on the monsoon. There is no reason why flying in to New Delhi in December every year should remain a gamble on the descending fog and the consequent drop in visibility. Foresight can make the prospect brighter.

 Letters to Editor

 Section breaks

 Sir ? Will the Supreme Court?s notices to the Centre and the Delhi government on the validity of Section 377 which criminalizes homosexuality, prove a U-turn for the gay movement in India? Homosexuals have to go through a lot ? reconcile to their sexuality, and then come out to family, friends and colleagues. All this is not easy; some even try to cover up with sham marriages. Thus this archaic law which the British put in place in 1868 has compelled many gay men in India to a lifetime of repression. Homosexuality is no longer a crime in many countries and some have even legalized same-sex marriages. Will the Indian lawmakers allow the gay community, which continues to be stigmatized in India, to have equal rights? The persons who are to pronounce a verdict are all (?) straight people. Will they have the sensitivity to restore the rights of the sexual minorities?

 Yours faithfully, 

 Dipro Ray, Calcutta

 Man of god

 Sir ? The life of Pope John Paul II was an inspiration, immersed in profound humility and love for both god and man. His many writings and tireless, worldwide pilgrimages of faith were a source of strength, encouragement and enlightenment not only to Catholics but to all men of good will. A champion of the poor and an ardent exponent of Christian unity, the Polish pontiff was in his many capacities as teacher, governor and holy man, both a beacon of light and the salt of the earth. Alongside his historic role in the fall of communism, John Paul II was also the world?s most influential and uncompromising defender of the dignity of human life. His tenacious plea for the development of a ?culture of life? and denunciation of a ?culture of death? has been instrumental in rallying opposition to war, terrorism, abortion, euthanasia, contraception, and embryonic-tissue research.

 Yours faithfully,

Paul Kokoski, Ontario

 Sir ? John Paul II?s orthodox views on abortion, contraception, homosexuality and divorce as well as his resistance to women priests drew criticism that he was out of step with the times. Thus, many Catholics respected him but found it difficult to obey him. But it is his attempt to reach out to other faiths that will be his most remarkable contribution. 

 Yours faithfully,

J.S. Acharya, Hyderabad

 Sir ? Death is a great leveller. I am amazed to see the Indian media showering praise on John Paul II after his death. The same media had not had nice things to say of him when, during his last visit to India, he had hoped that just as the first millennium had seen the cross planted on the soil of Europe, and the second in America and Africa, the third millennium should witness a harvest of faith on the Indian subcontinent. Death has covered the pope in glory and hidden his dark patches.

 Yours faithfully,

Orko Banerjee, Birmingham

 Sir ? When important people die, they are often praised to the skies. What is said about them is often notably lacking in objectivity, for fear that it might sound like criticism. This is what is happening now with Pope John Paul II. The pope is being called a champion of the poor and downtrodden ? and a defender of orthodoxy and conservatism. The first description means little by itself, since many undeserving people have been described thus; but together with the second, it is completely meaningless. What, in any religion, do orthodoxy and conservatism mean if not the maintenance of the existing social order, which is what keeps millions poor and downtrodden? 

 Yours faithfully,

Mukul Dube, New Delhi

 Sir ? When Karol Wojtyla became pope 27 years ago, the world was divided along the ideologies of left and the right. He worked to minimize those differences, preaching the message of peace and equality among all classes. Communism may be dead today, but the pope leaves behind a world which is as much divided, but along religious lines this time. 

 Yours faithfully,

Md. Mudassir Alam, Aligarh

 Sir ? The process of selecting a new pope, in perfect secrecy and confidentiality in a truly democratic way, should be the model for electing chief ministers in India. Legislators should be packed in sealed premises till they unanimously find a new leader. 

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir ? The ?secular? government of India has committed an impropriety by announcing three days? state mourning for the pope. Will the government do the same in the case of the deaths of saints/religious leaders of other communities like Hindus and Muslims who form 98 per cent of Indian population? 

 Yours faithfully, 

Hem Raj Jain, Bangalore 

 Sir ? Pope John Paul II represented the ideals of Christianity before the whole world in the real sense ? not through his words alone but through his actions as well. As Jesus had forgiven those who sinned against him, the pontiff too met and forgave Mehmet Ali Agca, the Turk who had tried to assassinate him at St Peter?s Square on May 13, 1981. He charmed Indians during his two visits to India in 1986 and 1999. Struck, in his own turn, by India?s ?unity in diversity? and ?secular culture?, the pope began the tradition of greeting Indians on Holi and Diwali.

 Yours faithfully,

Srinivasan Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? Pope John Paul ll?s greatness came to the fore when he opposed the attack on Iraq. As a Christian, George W. Bush should have abided by his advice. 

 Yours faithfully,

Suriya Hameed, Gulbarga

 Sir ? There appears to be a certain irony surrounding the postponement of Prince Charles?s wedding owing to the death of the pope. In the 16th century, Pope Clement VII had done his best to prevent the divorce and remarriage of Henry VIII, which led to a confrontation between the British monarchy and the papacy and the breakaway of the Church of England from Rome. Half a millennium later, John Paul II appears to have lived up to his predecessors in this matter, in death if not in life, by postponing a divorced prince?s remarriage ? even if by just one day.

 Yours faithfully,

Sourav Sengupta, Durgapur

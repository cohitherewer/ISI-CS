 DELIGHT AND DISSENT

 Neha Sahay

 National Day and China is red again: at least on the streets and in newspapers. Front-page pictures are full of school kids and National Day performers waving the Red Flag. Forced patriotism by state-owned newspapers? How then does one explain similar photographs on page one of Hong Kong?s South China Morning Post, which, compared to China?s newspapers, looks like an anti-establishment investigative trailblazer?

 In Hong Kong, feelings towards the mainland are mixed. This time, the special administrative region, which was returned by the British to China, saw celebratory fireworks, as well as demonstrations against human rights violations in Hong Kong and in China. 

 On the mainland, patriotism is genuine and widespread. But some Chinese privately tell you that they regard October 10, not October 1, as National Day. On October 10, 1911, an armed uprising spread through China, known as the Revolution of 1911. It culminated in the setting up of the Republic of China, under the leadership of SunYat-sen, marking the end of Imperial China. Today, ROC is how Taiwan is known internationally, though on the mainland, it?s just ?Taiwan province?. In Taiwan, National Day remains October 10.

 October 1, 1949, is the date of the establishment of the People?s Republic of China, or ?New China?, by the Communist Party led by Mao, which marked Liberation from foreign rule.

 In terms of official status, Sun Yat-sen seems to command more standing than Mao does, going by the number of memorials to him all over China. The queue to enter his grand, imposing mausoleum in Nanjing, is as long as the queue to enter Mao?s in Beijing. More institutions are named after him than after Mao. He is regarded as the Father of Modern China, though Westerners give that title to Mao?s successor, Deng Xiaoping, who opened China to foreign investment. 

 Clamping down

 Like our Republic Day, National Day here also sees celebrations in Tiananmen Square. Interestingly, while military parades were held in the first 10 years after Liberation, in September 1960, the Communist Party decided to simplify the celebration, according to the principle of ?building up the country through hard work and frugality?. 

 The next 10 years saw rallies, but no military parades. These were held again in 1984 and 1999, to mark the 35th and 50th anniversary of the founding of the PRC. Thousands gather in this vast square to see the flag hoisting, hence this site and this day are chosen by protesters to make their presence felt. Most of them are workers laid off from government enterprises, peasants protesting the takeover of their lands for ?development?, and poor residents of China?s glittering cities who face eviction for projects like the Olympics.

 The government takes no chances: October 1 is always preceded by rounding up of potential protesters. This year?s count was reported to be 200. Two years back, there had been two attempted suicides in Beijing in full view of the onlookers. In 1996, Beijing?s electricity workers had struck work and demonstrated against the delays in salary and the poor conditions of government-owned enterprises. This year, the crackdown continued after National Day. The government shut down an internet protest site that had been providing extensive coverage of a village campaign against a corrupt official in Guangdong, the main hub of foreign investment.

 The government has other ways of preventing protest. October 1-8 is also one of China?s three ?Golden holiday weeks?, when Chinese are encouraged to travel and splurge. As millions spread out across the country?s innumerable tourist destinations and supermarkets, who has the time or inclination to think about protesting farmers and workers?

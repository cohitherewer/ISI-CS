 ABSOLUTELY POOR

 Absolute poverty fosters absolute powerlessness. There are twice as many ?absolutely poor? children in Asia ? suffering from a severe deprivation of basic human needs like food, safe drinking water, health and education ? than in sub-Saharan Africa. Their numbers have been estimated at over 350 million, with half of Asia?s families failing to benefit from economic growth and globalization. With children, the problem is twofold: the general disempowerment of poverty is compounded with their particular voicelessness. It is easy to render the poor invisible, but doubly easy to do so in the case of absolutely poor children. Hence, within the over-all lack of basic human rights suffered by the poor, the rights of children become an even more inconceivable concept. Thus, children remain the ideal recipients of ?welfare?, subjected to society?s and the state?s notions of what is good for them, having less than minimal involvement and agency within these interventions. 

 Plan ? a child-centred organization working in 45 developing countries ? has published its strategic framework for fighting child poverty in Asia over the next ten years. What Growing Up in Asia underlines, as particularly relevant to the Indian context, is the need to change society?s perception of and attitude to children. How adults treat children is just as constitutive of the latter?s poverty as the lack of resources and access to services. What needs to be worked out is a ?child-centred community development approach?, which combines two essential elements. First, a recognition of the rights of children to participate in their own development, in decisions and issues that affect their own present and future lives. Second, this participation must also involve their families and communities, organized in representative groups, and forming partnerships and alliances with civil-society as well as governmental organizations. This is what a shift from ?welfare? to ?rights? entails in any development work involving children. It is a transition that requires the political will of the state as much as the sensitized awareness of civil society, transformations in everyday perceptions, attitudes and behaviour, as well as in laws and policies. The absolutely poor child in Asia silently demands nothing less than a perceptual revolution to be recognized as somebody to be reckoned with.

 GET READY FOR A REPEAT PERFORMANCE

 Conditions, be it social or political, are unlikely to change in a hurry in Bihar. Which means, says Sumanta Sen, the country might just witness another hung assembly in the state

 Without choice

 The Supreme Court may take a decision in the first week of September on the petitions filed against the dissolution of the Bihar assembly and the consequent imposition of president?s rule. If the petitions are upheld, then the dissolved house shall return to life. The Election Commission, on the other hand, is going ahead with the task of holding fresh elections in the state, perhaps sometime in October. It is certainly aware that the fate of its exercise will depend on the apex court?s decision. On the other hand, if the notification for the election is made before the court?s ruling then the latter perhaps will have nothing more to do with the issue.

 Things are in a flux. They, of course, always seem to be so in Bihar. Nobody really knows what is going on. The governor, Buta Singh, and chief secretary, G.S. Kang, fell out with each other and the latter resigned only to take back his letter and rejoin office. There are reports that the National Democratic Alliance constituents are now gunning for Buta Singh?s family members and Laloo Prasad Yadav is gunning for Buta Singh himself, wanting his replacement with somebody like P.M. Sayeed or Sushil Shinde. The Congress does not appear to be willing to accommodate Yadav, even though it is solely dependent on him for winning a few seats at the coming elections and, more importantly, to keep the NDA at bay.

 Overall, it is a highly unsettled state of affairs. If people had thought that with politicians at least temporarily out of the way, there would be a return to some show of administration, they were gravely mistaken. Law and order remains in a shambles, kidnappings for ransom are the order of the day. The EC continues to issue directives on the transfer of senior officials, but the rot has gone far deeper and the directives only reveal that.

 However, it must be admitted that the EC is at least trying to do something about the rotten state of affairs. It has ordered that the names of all those absconding from the law for six months should be deleted from the voters? lists and the task of issuing photo-identity cards completed by September 15. If it is really able to ensure that, then, even if no election is held right now because of the awaited Supreme Court decision, at least the backlog would be cleared to some extent.

 But will the commission succeed? To find out the names of the absconders, it will have to depend on the state administration, which is easily influenced by the political bosses, particularly in the districts. Perhaps ?influenced? is not the word, for at the lower levels of administration the official and the politician have become almost synonymous, having worked hand-in-glove for ages. 

 The nexus, of course, begins at the top and without it there could not have been so many scandals, the latest involving a Patna district magistrate himself. If the bureaucrat had really filched crores, he must have had men in dhotis around him. One can clearly recall the various allegations regarding cooperatives in the state and the open mention of names of bureaucrats and politicians, particularly a Congress member of Parliament. Governor Buta Singh could not have broken such a nexus, even if he had tried to, in the last few months.

 Then there is the issue of photo-identity cards. Nowhere in the country has the job been completed and in Bihar, too, the commission may well be forced to agree to go ahead with the polls with a huge number of voters still out of the scheme. The commission has to depend on its men on the spot and they always seem to come out with a thousand reasons for not completing the work.

 The question also is not one of checking false voters alone. If chunks of voters have cast their ballots under threat, then that is also ?false voting?. But legally, it is not so and hence the EC can do nothing about this. In a state where elections are unofficially supervised by caste bosses and their goons, the identity card is meaningless. This is much more of a social problem than an administrative one. And this does not come within the purview of the EC. Yet it makes a mockery of all its good intentions. Administrative measures cannot unsettle a settled socio-political scenario, no matter how murky it is.

 Yet life must go on and the motions have to be gone through to put in office a popular ministry. Here again the picture remains as confused as when Buta Singh, in his wisdom and as advised by his party mentors, decided not to add up numbers any more. 

 The confusion of course is all in the UPA and its allies. The Communist Party of India, which has no problems supporting a ministry which has the likes of Laloo Prasad Yadav and his men, has decided that in Bihar the UPA is untouchable. So it has decided to go in with the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) and Ram Vilas Paswan, who had the strange experience of seeing almost all his men crossing over to the NDA after he dilly-dallied on the issue of ministry formation. 

 The CPI says it is impressed with Paswan?s consistent anti-Laloo stand but then why doesn?t it, as well as Paswan himself, sever all relations with the UPA at the Centre? Acutely, there is no principle which is guiding Ajay Bhavan. The only consideration is how to increase the left?s numbers in the state assembly. 

 Parties like the Forward Bloc and the Revolutionary Socialist Party, which are also with the CPI in this, do not matter in Bihar. They know that with Laloo Yadav they don?t stand a chance of getting even a single seat to contest. So they have decided to jump onto the shoulders of the CPI(M-L). The latter now appears to be a much more acceptable left party in the state today. 

 It is also uncertain what Sharad Pawar will do. He has dreams beyond Bihar. Will such dreams allow him to antagonize a potential ally like Laloo Yadav and the CPI(M)?

 Mulayam Singh Yadav has no love lost for the other Yadav but he also wants the CPI(M) on his side, wary as he is of Congress moves in his own state. The Bihar Congress does not like Laloo but Sonia Gandhi has little option but to go with him and hope Digvijay Singh will be able to broker a fair deal for the party. So right now nobody knows who is with whom, even as they all claim that they are for secularism.

 In a normal situation this could mean a cakewalk for Nitish Kumar and Sushil Mody. But there is the caste arithmetic to boot, the Muslim vote and also the advantage of contesting polls with a politically sympathetic resident at the Raj Bhavan in Patna. It will also be great fun to watch what happens if another hung assembly is thrown up.

 Meanwhile, the nation will keep on seeing the strange spectacle of two Biharis, who are daggers-drawn in their own home turf, sharing seats in the same cabinet at the Centre. Of the two, Laloo Prasad Yadav is, of course, in a somewhat more enviable position. He is the man around whom the entire politics of Bihar revolves; he embodies, at it were, the various issues that keep on being repeated. What will happen when everybody?s whipping boy gets removed from the scene? Since things are unlikely to change in a hurry, his present day detractors will then have to find a replacement from among themselves.

 RIGHT IN FRONT OF OUR EYES

 Gouri Chatterjee

 We saw it all happen right in front of our eyes. The huge statue of Saddam Hussein being pushed and toppled by gleeful Iraqis in a Baghdad square. Palestinians dancing with joy as the Twin Towers crumbled to dust in New York. Gun-toting masked men jamming booths and stuffing ballot boxes in a Bihar election. Hair-raising jaw-dropping moments only TV could give us. 

 It was only later that we learned, seeing is not always believing. Wide-angle shots on more than one internet site showed the full picture, complete with a big crane, strong cables, US tanks surrounding the square and other ?details?. The celebratory Palestinians predated 9/11; CNN had used file images. 

 Gunmen did call the shots in that (and in many other) Bihar election but it was not they who provided the photo ops for that Doordarshan programme. The scenes were realistic but not real; they were stage-managed.

 Vivek Oberoi, a child of the celluloid world, needs no lesson in the use and misuse of moving images. Hence his knee-jerk cry of ?distortion? after inviting Prabhu Chawla, on air, to dance at his wedding (and causing ?immense distress in the Rai residence?). Even Chawla would find it tough to ?twist,? as Oberoi now says, his words so ?out of context? on TV. 

 Nor would it have been worth his while. Television can, and does, lie but usually the stakes are higher. Oberoi, who is forever in the news for all the wrong reasons, ought to have learnt that by now.

 Maximum city

 Gabriel Garc?a M?rquez may have won the Nobel Prize for literature, but ?the best profession in the world?, he has always said, is journalism. 

 But the definition of journalism that he holds high ? ?the notion that the best news is not always the news that is obtained first, but very often the news that is best presented? ? as he told students of his native Colombia a few years ago, is just not there in India.

 Even in newspapers and magazines, which anyway have to play catch to TV and internet, journalistic glory lies in breaking news, scoops, exclusives. The culture is, speed rules. The competition is in getting the news first, churning it out fast, taking pride in the bylines totted up.

 You learn to live with that, until you read Suketu Mehta?s absolutely riveting and mind-blowing Maximum City. This is journalism at its finest, of a kind never seen in this country before and never will be in any Indian paper or magazine.

 It is not just that Mehta is exceptionally talented at getting people to talk even as he declares his intentions to them, opens up his laptop and takes notes. It is not even that he writes beautiful prose, rich, evocative, often gut-churning descriptions that reflect his insights into human nature. 

 As M?rquez told his students, what stands in the way of ?best presented? news is not ?the obvious deficiencies in language, style and subject matter? but, most importantly, curiosity about life itself.? 

 A curiosity that will not be hurried until it has the answers. Mehta took seven years to write the book, hoarding up so much that could have made him famous long ago. Mehta chose to wait to present his best rather than the quickest.

 Chelsea vs Blair

 Chelsea may not have won on Tuesday night but it has something to cheer about. In the crucial final days of the British election campaign, the football club received more coverage than the two UK opposition leaders combined. Tony Blair, of course, dominated but he may not have objected to 1,100 articles less, the number that mentioned both Blair and ?lie? or ?liar?.

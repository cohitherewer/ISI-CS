 EVIL DESIGNS 

The violence in Karbi Anglong shows that the government 

should be more sceptical about demands for ethnic homelands, says Sanjib Baruah

 Spare a thought 

We may never be able to name and punish the individuals 

directly responsible for the recent killing spree in Assam?s Karbi Anglong district. 

But one thing is quite clear: there is a connection between the political agendas 

of groups engaged in the early stages of negotiations with the government of India 

and what the violence has tried to achieve on the ground. The displacement of 

targeted ethnic groups from their hearth and home in certain areas fits well with 

what leaders of some ethnic militias seek to achieve at the negotiating table. 

Given this pattern, many apparently moderate leaders of ethnic movements in the 

North-east could be accused of complicity with ethnic cleansing. But our legal 

and political processes do not take the crime of ethnic cleansing as seriously 

as international law does.

To ensure that such violence is not repeated, it is 

important to understand the logic of de facto exclusive ethnic homelands 

that has come to capture the imagination of ethnic militants in the region. Our 

decision-makers have taken a far too benign view of this phenomenon and given 

little attention to the long-term costs of perpetuating the idea.

There is now a perception in the North-east that exclusionary 

ethnic agendas ? no matter how unfair they are from the perspective of other ethnic 

groups living in the same area ? have a chance of success if there is a demonstrated 

capacity for sustained political mobilization. And with appropriate positioning 

vis-?-vis rival ethnic militias, the local counter-insurgency establishment 

could even become an ally.

Officials who enter into negotiations with ethnic 

militias do not seem to realize that a demand for a homeland may enjoy the support 

of a particular ethnic group, but other ethnic groups living in the same area 

may feel threatened by it. The government?s readiness to concede to such demands 

has gradually weakened political forces that stand for a more pluralistic form 

of politics.

This is not the first time in recent years that Karbi 

Anglong and the adjacent North Cachar Hills districts have seen such mayhem. There 

has been widespread violence between Karbis and Kukis in Karbi Anglong, and between 

Dimasas and Hmars in the North Cachar Hills. The two were part of a single district 

until 1970, and the present conflicts in the districts are related. The Mikir 

Hills district was renamed Karbi Anglong in 1976. The Dimasas are a minority scheduled 

tribe in Karbi Anglong, but constitute a majority of the tribal population in 

North Cachar Hills district. The demand of the Karbi ethnic militia, the United 

Peoples Democratic Solidarity, for a homeland for the Karbis, and the demand of 

the Dima Halam Daogah for a ?Dimaraji state? ? and the efforts to rename the North 

Cachar Hills district ?Dima Halili?? provide the backdrop to these episodes of 

ethnic violence.

But a homeland for one ethnic group often translates 

into second-class citizenship status for another, even though materially one may 

be no worse off than the latter. Homeland demands in the North-east therefore 

inevitably invite conflict. Ethnic militias seeking a homeland come in conflict 

with groups that are seen as obstacles to the demand. That was the source of the 

Dimasa-Hmar violence of 2003. The Dimaraji envisioned by Dimasa activists is not 

limited to North Cachar Hills district. It extends to areas in neighbouring Karbi 

Anglong and Cachar districts, and it also includes Dimapur, the commercial centre 

of Nagaland.

DHD activists have reportedly encouraged and facilitated 

new Dimasa settlements in the Dhansiri and Kheroni Charali area in Karbi Anglong. 

There were signboards proclaiming Eastern Dimaraji in these areas. These moves 

led to significant tensions between Dimasa and Karbi militants prior to the recent 

outbreak of violence. The government of India?s decision, following the ceasefire 

with the DHD, to set up one of the designated camps for DHD militants in this 

area, became a source of irritation for Karbi militants. Indeed, according to 

several reports, militants housed in that camp were responsible for some of the 

most gruesome killings of Karbis.

Like the DHD, the UPDS too has signed a ceasefire 

agreement with the Centre in 2002. As it often happens in such situations, it 

produced a dissident faction. Members of the anti-talks factions, now known as 

the Karbi Longri North Cachar Hills Liberation Front and the Karbi Longri North 

Cachar Hills Resistance Force, appear to be major players in the revenge attacks 

against Dimasas as well as in earlier outbreaks of violence against Kukis.

Certain peculiarities of property rights in the hills 

of north-east India give ethnic militias unusual capacity to change demographic 

realities on the ground. In places that are designated as forest areas and in 

lands that are set aside for shifting cultivation, there is considerable fluidity 

in settlement patterns. Many groups may have settled and begun to cultivate such 

lands relatively recently. Since these people do not have legal papers to prove 

property rights ? and in any case, most of these lands have not been surveyed 

? ethnic militias seeking to displace them can do so with relative ease. 

The only security that such a group can get is from 

an ethnic militia of its own. The government is not in a position to defend their 

property rights, especially since the settlement itself, say in what is technically 

a forest reserve, may be illegal.

Thus, whether a particular population is indigenous 

to an area or not often becomes a highly contested issue. At the root of the Karbi-Kuki 

violence of 2003 was the Karbi view that Kukis are an immigrant community occupying 

their land. While Kukis living in the Hamren subdivision of Karbi Anglong are 

indigenous, say Karbi militants, those living in the Singhason-Khonbamon Hill 

range of Diphu subdivision are recent migrants from Nagaland and Manipur.

Yet the latter group of Kukis cultivate a highly-valued 

commercial ginger crop that not only finds its way to other parts of India, but 

has invited recent export orders from as far away as Germany. But Kuki farmers 

today are too scared to go to their fields. Plans to set up ginger candy and ginger 

paste producing plants in the area have been shelved. The economic costs of the 

violence accompanying homeland politics can be quite high.

As the plight of these ginger growers highlight, responding 

to ethnic militancy and meeting the challenges of economic development of the 

North-east are not separate issues. By giving in uncritically to the demands for 

ethnic homelands we have encouraged more such demands, leading to more ethnic 

violence. By giving a short shrift to the democratic value of equality among citizens 

we have risked making the North-east permanently ungovernable.

 ADAPTING TO HISTORY

 Constancy is a bore. It is also stupid to boot. There is no special virtue in upholding ideological verities that have been swept away by the tides of history. To deny, ostrich-like, the changes that time has wrought, suggests a mindset that is so hidebound that it is unable to recognize reality when it is almost palpable. Such constancy has nothing to recommend it since it belongs to Jurassic Park. Think of those who clung to the belief of a geocentric universe after the discoveries of Copernicus and Galileo. If the discovery of a heliocentric universe marked a radical shift in the beliefs of human beings, the last fifteen years have also engendered a fundamental transformation in political praxis. Nobody, except those who choose to live in a self-constructed Jurassic Park, quite believes that the future belongs to communism or that it is possible to win political and electoral battles on a socialist programme. 

 Globally, there has been a shift away from the left and to an embracing of the capitalist ethic. One example of this is the policy adopted by the communist party in China: to call itself communist but to pursue what are avowedly capitalist goals. But an even more significant example comes from Great Britain. There, Mr Tony Blair abandoned for good the socialist baggage that the Labour Party had carried for years, and adapted to his party?s programme some of the policies of Ms Margaret Thatcher. The electoral dividends of such a move are obvious. The Labour Party has not only retained its traditional base but has also drawn voters from the Tory ranks. The Tories, disillusioned with the Conservative Party, now see Mr Blair?s Labour Party carrying forward Ms Thatcher?s unfinished agenda. The old sharp distinction between Labour and Tory has become blurred because of the new ideological space that has been created by Mr Blair.

 A parallel development seems to be emerging in the politics of West Bengal under the leadership of Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. In the last four years, two important political trends have become clear. One is the complete collapse of Ms Mamata Banerjee as the sole spokesman of all anti-left aspirations. The disillusionment with her and her brand of populism is total. The other is the rise of Mr Bhattacharjee as the champion of economic reforms. There has taken place a distinct pro-capitalist shift in the positions and policies adopted by the chief minister and the party?s state leadership. Mr Bhattacharjee has changed his ideological position to suit the times. This is a sign of his political acumen. As a consequence, the disillusioned Trinamool voter is thinking of Mr Bhattacharjee as a viable alternative. He seems to embody the new spirit of optimism which the people of West Bengal have yearned for. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) might still style itself as a Stalinist monolith but its leadership is much too canny to underestimate the winds of change.

 It might be too early to draw lessons from history but to ignore history?s movements is to court disaster. Politicians, for their own survival, read the signals lest they become dinosaurs.

 STALLING THE DECLINE

 Malvika Singh

 The unprecedented heat that envelopes the north of India each year makes one understand why this country has remained ?underdeveloped? when the rest of the world has moved ahead. It is impossible to function here for six months when the infrastructure of simple necessities such as electricity and water is not forthcoming. The core area of the capital, Connaught Place, a stone?s throw from the houses of parliament, goes without power for at least four working hours a day. Representatives of the people draw all the power for themselves. 

 One shudders to think what the condition is in the hinterland. This is, most definitely, one reason why we are behind the rest of the world in economic terms although our minds, skills and abilities are superior to most, one of the last surviving repositories of fine traditions and meticulous creations. We have failed the strengths of this country, let down the people and exploited their patience.

 One reason why nerve centres of political and administrative action moved from the plains to the hills, was to beat the heat, work from a civilized clime and be productive through the year. This year we were hit by unprecedented heat, all a result of the fast diminishing green cover. It will get worse and worse as the years roll on. For the same reason rivers will flood and wreak destruction, water will cease to be potable, disease will run amuck and life will become unbearable.

 Led by the mother

 To check this decline appears almost impossible and those who administer us seem to know so. They do nothing to correct anything. As this country moves sideways within a failed development model, things are going wrong fundamentally. Let?s look at one example that affects us all. The ongoing construction boom has builders grabbing and usurping any spot of land they can lay their hands on to build unwieldy, ugly structures that come together as new colonies with no water, no green lung, no facility whatsoever for dignified living. Aesthetic sensibilities have died, traditional delicacy in building has been thrown to the winds as concrete suffocates us. No norms are adhered to, no rules apply, and municipal limits have become the showcase for anarchy and corruption. As one drives through the towns of India, northern India, one connects with the corrosion of all that meets the eye. Sadly, it doesn?t seem to meet the eye of those who rule and administer us.

 Can this breakdown be corrected? Can a further deterioration be stalled? Will those wild, pristine and unmatched areas that have not yet been tainted, be immunized against this fast-growing cancer? Will the skills and strengths of the Indian people ever be celebrated? Small towns stink with open drains, mounds of domestic waste lying about on the streets, laced with the stench of stale urine and with the walls of the buildings patterned with long streaks of paan spit. Strangely, gender has something to do with this abysmal and shameful state of affairs. One never sees a woman peeing or spitting and women are not at the helm of the municipalities.

 This is a mere thought, a passing thought, that women being the stronger sex, and Indian mothers particularly, being the dominant force in the lives of their sons, should lead from the front and take charge of the administration of living, and move beyond the home into the public domain, enter the mohalla to take on the resposibility for the needs of the community and the habitat within which they live. Women are also the living repository of tradition, culture, language, myth and legend, philosophy and religion. They pass the baton from one generation to the other and because they are the creators for the future, they comprehend human needs better than the other sex. Therefore, they should set the parameters for life and living.

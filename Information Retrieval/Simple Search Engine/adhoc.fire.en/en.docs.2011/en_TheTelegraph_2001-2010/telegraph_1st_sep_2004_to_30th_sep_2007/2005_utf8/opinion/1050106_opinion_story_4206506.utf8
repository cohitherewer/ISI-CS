 Letters to Editor

 Coming together

 Sir ? The confluence of East and West symbolized in the violin, and celebrated by Githa Hariharan in ?The naturalized violin? (Jan 2), is laudable. The Western and Indian traditions of music are very different. The Western musician starts at a point and builds up, describing a mood, while the Indian musician-composer creates, probes its depths, revolves around it and examines it from every angle, conveying the full flavour of bhava and rasa with the help of gamak (grace notes). But it is sad that Hariharan compares works in English by Indian authors to khichdi. Some would compare it to risotto flavoured with coriander leaves, or pizza flavoured with curry pata, or may be a silk kurta worn with jeans. We are as proud of Sir Vidia as of T.K. Jayarama Iyer; Vikram Seth and Arundhati Roy as Dwaram Venkataswamy Naidu, who played Carnatic music as well as Bach, Beethoven and Rossini on the violin, sitting cross-legged on the floor. It is like having cheddar/mozzarella with tomato utthappam. Quite a khichdi, eh?

 Yours faithfully, 

 P.K. Basu, Calcutta

 Freedom to be

 Sir ? Swapan Dasgupta?s contention, ?Secularization of democracies has gone too far?, is based on a wrong interpretation of the word secular (?The Holiday party?, Dec 30). Here in India, the pseudo-secularists claim that it means equal recognition of all religions by the government. Actually it should mean the non-recognition of all religions, as far as the state is concerned. The secular state should concern itself only with the material well-being of its citizens, leaving their spiritual welfare to themselves. No minister, or legislator should associate with any religious activity in his official capacity. For example, it is ridiculous that Laloo Prasad Yadav, a self-professed secularist, should worship Viswakarma in his office and attribute the recent train collision in Punjab to the displeasure of the deity. Of course, a secular government should also ensure that nobody hurts another?s religious sentiments under the guise of ?freedom of expression?.

 Yours faithfully,

C.V. Krishnamoorthy, Calcutta

 Sir ? Is Swapan Dasgupta trying to say, in a long-drawn manner, that sensitivity to the feelings of minorities ? which includes not using public facilities for religious ceremonies, a restraint that has already been shown by many nations ? is wrong? While extremes of any kind should be avoided, why should cards not say ?Season?s Greetings? or some such secular thing? In any case, greeting cards are sent in individual capacities, and one can always add personal messages like Happy Christmas, Diwali Greetings or Id Mubarak. While it cannot be denied that some American voters have been upset by the extreme fringe liberals who wish to make same-sex marriage legal, may I assure Dasgupta that ?non-temple-going but self-professed Hindus? like me are not unhappy at the practice and propagation of secularism. It is only closet fascists like Dasgupta who feel the need for Saraswati Vandana at the start of state functions.

 Yours faithfully,

Alok Sarkar, Calcutta

 Sir ? Democracy, religious freedom, multiculturalism, national identity and secularism are terms coined assuming the innocence of the common people. In reality there is only the dangerous ignorance of a huge mass of confused but desperate people, united in pursuit of an absurd, intolerant dream ? something that Swapan Dasgupta fails to identify. 

 Fundamental to human response are, as Spinoza said, endeavours to persist in its own being. As secular ideologies required people, for historical reasons, to worship wealth and comfort, class and nation, power became the pursuit and expression of the essence of being. 

 Today the short-cut to power is to be on the politically correct side of the huge mass, likely to grow in the coming days, while keeping its political agenda intact. Multiculturalism, secularism and so on, are terms which will be adopted or interpreted accordingly. Since ?rational? is still a word with a positive connotation, so-called rationalism has many buyers. 

 Yours faithfully,

Abhijit Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Images of hope

 Sir ? The front-page photograph on the January 1, 2005 edition of a girl holding a few biscuits was excellent. It may be compared to the picture of a nude girl running after a napalm attack by the American air force on a village in Vietnam. That picture had aroused the conscience of the world against the atrocities of one nation against another. Hopefully, this picture will arouse the conscience of party-hopers who were enjoying themselves in clubs and hotels when their countrymen in vast stretches of coastal India were spending the night without food or water. 

 Yours faithfully,

Partha De Sarkar, Calcutta

 Sir ? The little girl in Cuddalore 

 was delightful. She was satisfied with four biscuits even 

 in the midst of all that devastation, even though she did 

 not have proper clothes to wear. Reports say that children 

 have been the worst hit by the tsunami. Top priority should 

 be given to helping them. 

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

 Sir ? The front-page photographs captioned, ?Panic wave? (Dec 31), ostensibly depicting the tsunami could well have been taken for real but for their amateurish editing. Even my 11-year-old daughter could detect the fraud for the following conspicuous reasons. The second shot is just a close-up of the first, as is clear from the magnified images of the hills and boats. Likewise, the fourth shot is a close-up of the third ? the foreign tourists on the beach have identical postures. Does The Telegraph think all its readers are na?ve?

 Yours faithfully,

Shivaji K. Moitra, Calcutta

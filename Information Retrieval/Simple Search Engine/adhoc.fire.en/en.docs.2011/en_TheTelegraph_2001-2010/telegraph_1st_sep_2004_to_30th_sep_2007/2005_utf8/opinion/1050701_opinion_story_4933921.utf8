 NOT FOR ALL

 The president is not supposed to be paradoxical. But Mr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam?s views on the Indian citizens? right to information seem to be precisely that. The right to information bill 1had been passed by the government in May this year and got the president?s assent a little more than a week ago. This would have been an important milestone in the Indian state?s nervous and hesitant move towards transparency had the president himself not done something decidedly odd a few days ago. He sent a note to the prime minister suggesting some cautious rethinking regarding the issue. It seems that Mr Kalam wants to make his office immune, to some extent, to the openness and accountability guaranteed to the citizen by the new bill. Official communications between the president and the prime minister should remain confidential. Mr Kalam has also suggested that notings made by bureaucrats on files should also remain privileged information, since bureaucratic decisions might be influenced by the fear of public disclosure.

 The profound, and hence unthinking, discomfort with transparency, which the Indian state has always shown from its colonial days to the present is embodied in Mr Kalam?s communications to Mr Manmohan Singh. Coming from the first citizen, this is doubly unfortunate. If the president?s role is symbolic, then the symbolic meaning of Mr Kalam?s act is inimical to democracy. Moreover, it is not for the president to undermine the various stages of scrutiny ? the ?public benefit test? outlined in the new bill ? that would decide whether a certain document might be granted exemption from the citizen?s right to look at it. There has to be a more democratic way of deciding whether disclosure is more damaging than secrecy. It is, of course, true that the Constitution guarantees the secrecy of the president?s communications to the prime minister. But the whole point of the Right to Information Act is to give the public access to papers and documents, which have hitherto been sealed from view by some law or the other. And the reason for subjecting bureaucrats to the possibility of their notings being looked at by the public is to make them more scrupulous and attentive decision-makers. Mr Kalam?s intervention might significantly constrain the freeing power of the new act. The prime minister should do some hard thinking before responding to the president?s suggestions.

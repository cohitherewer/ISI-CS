 Letters to Editor

 Murdering our inheritance

 Sir ? Ramachandra Guha?s definition of a nationalist as ?someone who scorns other countries? makes the followers of Savarkar, who scorn Pakistan, nationalists. But the same people have also claimed for over 75 years, on behalf of all Hindus, that it is the permanent fate of all non-Hindus of India to serve the majority community. There are mass murderers amongst them. But there also are, and were, mass murderers amongst the ?secular? Congressmen, who organized the 1984 pogrom against Sikhs in Delhi. The truth of the matter is that the Indian state has failed to bring mass murderers to book. The injustices of Partition happened partly because sections of the local elite wanted it to happen. That elite is still in charge. Thus, for a Parsi like me, the question still is: How do I go, unafraid, to Gujarat? In 1984, it was ? what if someone takes me, as they took my bearded Hindu friend, Vijay Kumar, for a Sikh who had given up wearing a turban? I was scared to go to Mumbai after the riots in 1992. We need voices a little less feeble than Guha?s to convince us of our great Indian inheritance.

 Yours faithfully,

Meher Engineer, Calcutta

 Watch thy neighbour

 Sir ? I agree with the main thrust of Abhijit Bhattacharyya?s argument that Nepal poses a very delicate and complex challenge (?Look kindly on a friend?, April 1). But we need to make a few distinctions. First, we should not be under the illusion that the monarchy, in its current form, is an effective means for combatting the Maoists. What has the suspension of civil liberties, the imprisonment of political leaders, the ban on newspapers, the harassment of intellectuals, got to do with combatting the Maoists? In fact, the state of emergency is only making things worse, by driving otherwise anti-Maoist forces to ally with Maoists. The king?s current actions are a product of his insecurities and intoxication with power, they have little to do with Maoists. Second, yes it is in our interest to keep the Chinese dragon at bay. But the plain fact is that despite our support to the king, we have not succeeded. On India and China, the monarchy has had its cake and can eat it as well. 

 Finally, sympathy for monarchy is not the same thing as sympathy for the Nepalese people. For too long we have let the king get away with underdeveloping Nepal. True sympathy will consist in engaging political forces and the Maoists in Nepal in an imaginative way so that they may come to a compromise, not in letting the king blackmail us into giving him a carte blanche. Bhattacharyya?s point about dictatorships in Pakistan is well taken ? our powers are clearly limited. But that does not suggest that we should not prudently promote healthy civil societies wherever we can (including in India!)

 Yours faithfully,

Pratap Bhanu Mehta, Gurgaon

 Sir ? Pratap Bhanu Mehta hits the nail on its head when he talks about the China factor in the crisis that has gripped Nepal (?Losing Kathmandu?, March 30). It is evident that one of China?s prime motives behind cosying up to King Gyanendra is to somehow establish a decisive foothold in Nepali politics, and to replace the clout Delhi currently holds in the king?s court. Beijing?s sole aim is to encircle India with hostile banana republics, and as Mehta points out, we are too slow to react to the threat.

 The author also talks about the hegemonic image India has projected of itself in the subcontinent. However, he is mistaken when he suggests that India needs to look at its neighbours as equals, rather than subordinate to its interests. A comparable situation exists in North America ? while the Mexicans and Canadians look at the United States of America as an overbearing force, there is little they can do. For there exists a complex economic relation between these countries and the US, which they cannot afford to disrupt. For our long-term interest, we need to develop a similar trading network. A sincere boost to the South Asian Free Trade Association would be a good starting point. As far as Nepal is concerned, Mehta is right that we need to maintain a reasonable distance from both parties (while ensuring there is no infiltration into Indian territory) and make it crystal clear that any government will have to unveil a constitutional council and establish friendly relations with India.

 Yours faithfully,

Aruni Mukherjee, Coventry, UK

 Sir ? It is imperative that our foreign policy and our parleys with the Nepalese establishment reflect our democratic values enshrined in the constitution. It is also time to turn our attention to our eastern neighbour. 

 Yours faithfully,

J. Mathew, Calcutta

 Sir ? Ashok Mitra, while citing the unimplemented land reforms in Nepal as a reason for the rise of the Maoists, does not care to mention the same lack in India, which has led to the revival of the Naxal agitation (?After the sock in the eye?, Feb 18). India, being a huge country with more bullet power than Nepal has been able to keep the Naxals in check without worldwide publicity ? something Nepal could not. And while criticizing the monarchy, why does Mitra forget that India continues to be under the direct or indirect influence of one political dynasty? The author is, however, quite correct in fearing the consequences if the US tries to ?install? democracy in Nepal by military intervention, because it would drag China into Nepal. This does not augur well for India. India must stop arms supply to Nepal and persuade Gyanendra to re-install democracy immediately. 

 Yours faithfully,

Pijush Banerjee, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir ? Malvika Singh, in her self-admittedly ?relentless bureaucracy bashing?, glosses over the paramount role the bureaucracy has played in shielding the country from the vagaries of politicians (?Time for a new vision?, March 29). If a new breed of forward-looking politicians is struggling to make its presence felt, it is largely because of the congenial atmosphere evolved by one former babu, T.N. Seshan, when he was chief election commissioner. Countless other bureaucrats have risked their careers in order to stand up for what the Constitution enjoined them to do. There is, however, no denying the existence of rotten apples, but that is true of any other profession.

 Yours faithfully,

Subhasis Das, Sabroom, South Tripura

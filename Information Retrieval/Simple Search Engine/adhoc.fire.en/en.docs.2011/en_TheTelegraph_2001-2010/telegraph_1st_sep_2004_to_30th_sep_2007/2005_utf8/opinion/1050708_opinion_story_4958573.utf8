 STRAIGHT OUT OF A ROMANCE

 The English Dane

 By Sarah Bakewell,

 Rupa, ? 11.40 

 Several attempts have been made to reconstruct the life of Jorgen Jorgenson. The son of a Danish clock-maker, he was an Anglophile who became part of the Napoleonic wars, had to hunt down British ships and landed up in a British prison. He was king of Iceland for two months. For a while, he was reported to be a British spy in the Continent, where he started gambling and drinking, was banished and landed up as a convict in Tasmania. He became an explorer, married an Irish convict, and wrote A Shred of Autobiography. The man?s story spans lands, generations and times and is shrouded in a lot of romantic myths. Historians have not been helped by the fact that Jorgenson, never one to let facts get in the way of a good story, would often give his own spin to his adventures. 

 Of the many books on this nineteenth century adventurer, The Usurper by Dan Sprod wanders through the maze of Jorgenson?s life in awe. While Clune, Frank and P.R. Stephensen write in The Viking of Van Diemen?s Land: The Stormy Life of Jorgen Jorgenson, ?In some ways, he was a Viking, born ten centuries too late; in other ways he was an adventurer on seas of thought born too soon?Whether he rests now in Valhalla or in a Christian paradise or in any other haven of seafaring mariners, he could at least have the satisfaction of having used his time on earth to the fullest extent.? 

 Richard Flanagan in Gould?s Book of Fish calls Jorgenson ?a miserable looking piece of pelican shit... with his principal companion ? a mangy three-legged dog he called Elsinor ? hopping along in its rutted wake.? The anger aroused by the memory of aborigines exterminated by merchant-convicts from another world can be perceived in the above comment. Jorgenson?s life embodies the flux and rapacity of 18th century war-torn Europe. 

 Sarah Bakewell?s portrait of Jorgenson is remarkable for its evocativeness and precision. It reads like a Gothic romance, say, from the pen of Mary Shelley. Bakewell harps on the contrasts that typified Jorgenson?s life. He was a rebel and an Anglophile at a time imperialism was rearing its ugly head; he had dreams of sailing round the world, yet remained in Europe drinking and wasting away; he was a king and a convict. He became a British spy, despite having fought a battle for democracy, and against despotism, in Iceland. 

 Bakewell talks too about the books he wrote. She says, ?The purpose of every book of Jorgenson?s was lost in a herd of hobby horses?. In the Newgate prison he wrote and published a book on Christianity which led to a brawl between the deists and the conventional creationists. 

 The account of Jorgenson?s exploits in Van Diemen?s Land is most gripping. A friend of the aborigines and an enemy of the bushrangers, he was something of a Robin Hood-figure even while enforcing laws against the natives.

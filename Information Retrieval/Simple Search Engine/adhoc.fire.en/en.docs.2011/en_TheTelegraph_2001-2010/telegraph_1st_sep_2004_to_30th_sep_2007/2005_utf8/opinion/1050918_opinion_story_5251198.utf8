 DIARY

 From Tehran with wisdom. Our unputdownable external affairs minister, K Natwar Singh, seems to have thoroughly enjoyed his trip to Iran, and with reason. During his visit, the minister had supposedly insisted on seeing the grave of Shamsuddin Muhammad or Hafiz, the famous Sufi and Persia?s most beloved poet. At the grave, Natwar could not help following the great Persian tradition of consulting the Fal-e Hafiz. According to Persian belief, if anyone faces a difficulty, one could seek Hafiz?s guidance in his randomly selected poems. And more often than not, Hafiz is supposed to give direction, in his own enigmatic way. The first line of any poem that catches the eye of the seeker bears the answer, and the rest of the verse is supposed to give further clarification. In Singh?s case, the opening lines had talked about solitude, recommending the troubled soul to drink wine and be merry. Our erudite minister obviously had his own interpretation of those lines. But even without that, the words make perfect sense. Don?t they, Minister?

 Now why would Praful Goradia, one-time BJP MP, want to register a society under the Societies Registration Act, named (of all things) Jana Sangh? Apparently, a few months after the party failed to renominate him to the upper house, Goradia quit the BJP, saying it had jettisoned its ideology and that he would revive the Jana Sangh. In that case, however, shouldn?t he have knocked on the doors of the Election Commission? Anyway, the application made to the registrar of societies apparently shows that most members of the proposed Jana Sangh are drawn from Goradia?s immediate family. Perhaps the BJP should not mind. Goradia, in the true sanghi style, is trying to make politics a family business. 

 Move over Ram, its Arjun?s time now. Everyone in the BJP seems desperate to be like him. It started some time back with Uma Bharti. When she was thrown out of power, she swore that she would fight like Arjun till her last breath. Next, it was the turn of the BJP president. Mired in the Jinnah controversy, LK Advani had claimed at a book release function that he would ?fight like Arjun?. And more recently it was Madan Lal Khurana. At Atal Bihari Vajpayee?s residence, Khurana gleefully declared that he would....

 While journos covering the BJP beat are brimming with news, those shadowing the Congresswallahs are facing a famine. The Congress headquarters at 24, Akbar Road wears a forlorn look, with leaders not even bothering to sit on the chairs they lobby so hard for. Apparently, except for the AICC treasurer, Motilal Vora, gen-secs Janardhan Dwivedi and Digvijay Singh, and secretaries, the rest rarely show up. The reason being offered for the dearth of news copies is the imposition of censorship within the party. The high-profile media department in fact has supposedly been converted to the censor cell, with all its incumbents ? the media sec, Tom Vadakkan, as also the two media coordinators, Anees Durrani and BS Bilodi ? been made members of the censor board. There is talk of the I amp;B minister, S Jaipal Reddy, being made the chief spokesman of the board, and Anand Sharma, who is desperate for a post, the chairman. But if Rahul Gandhi?s foot-in-mouth syndrome is any indication, the board doesn?t seem to be doing its job. 

 The Muslim clergy at the Deoband seminary have been labouring hard, and not necessarily against women. They are trying to eradicate some social evils too ? for example the fake amils, who cheat people by promising to solve their problems or by exorcising ghosts. In the narrow bylanes of all major Indian cities, one can notice the ever-increasing ?Amil clinics?, luring people for a cure of their maladies. Will there be a fatwa against them too?

 When Pranab Mukherjee was finance minister, his wife, Geeta, flowered into a great singer. IK Gujral?s wife, Shiela, emerged a litterateur when her husband was the PM. And Atal Bihari Vajpayee, a poet of some standing all along, had his poems sung by noted Bollywood artistes, when he occupied the PM?s gaddi. The capital?s culture-vultures recently got another powerful poet to celebrate. A few days ago, Sudip Banerjee, secretary, HRD ministry, had a book of poems released at a function where several poets sang his praise. 

 Narendra Modi?s detractors may be pulling their hair out and threatening self-immolation, but the chhote sardar is unfazed. But the show of power has its flip side too. Modi had boasted of being the most powerful chief minister by virtue of being able to supply 24x7 power throughout the state. Now that power cuts have become a way of life in Gujarat, his rivals are asking if this is any indication that Modi?s ?power? is on the wane. 

 On the other side of the political divide, the Congress is (and without causing any surprise) also powerless, even to think constructively. The other day, the Gujarat Congress unit came up with a brilliant idea to protest against Modi?s move to curtail the ongoing assembly session. In Ahmedabad, residents got to see a few hundred Congressmen carrying balloons in all seriousness. The multi-coloured floaters had slogans against Modi, and they delighted no one but the children.

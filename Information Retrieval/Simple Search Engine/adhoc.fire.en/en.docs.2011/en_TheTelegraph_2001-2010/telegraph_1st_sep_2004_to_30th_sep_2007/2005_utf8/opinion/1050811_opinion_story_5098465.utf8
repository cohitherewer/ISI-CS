 BEST SACKED

 Mr Jagdish Tytler should no longer be entitled to any of the titles he enjoys. He is a cabinet minister and well-known Congress leader. But he has been clearly identified in the report of the Nanavati commission as one of the leaders who, in the aftermath of Indira Gandhi?s assassination, instigated and led the pogrom against the Sikhs of Delhi. According to the report of the commission, ?credible evidence? was presented before it to prove Mr Tytler?s direct involvement. It is appalling that even after this official confirmation of his participation in the massacres, Mr Tytler has been allowed to continue as a cabinet minister. There has even been an attempt on the part of the government to gloss over the evidence presented before the commission and the conclusion that Mr G.T. Nanavati drew from that evidence. The initial response of the government was that no action could be taken against Mr Tytler because the evidence against him was not certain and incontrovertible. This can only be interpreted as a ham-handed attempt at a cover-up. No civilized government can afford to have in its ranks a man against whom there is a substantial corpus of evidence of having initiated a pogrom. Mr Tytler may still be given the sack under pressure from the opposition and the allies of the Congress. By making him quit as the report became public knowledge ? or better still, by not making him minister at all ? the government could have saved injury to its credibility.

 It is not enough that Mr Tytler leaves the ministry. He should also be made to leave the Lok Sabha and be expelled from the Congress. Mr Tytler has broken one of the central pillars of the Congress creed. He has acted against the principle of secularism. By doing so, he has lost his right to remain even a primary member of the Congress. The Congress president, Ms Sonia Gandhi, should waste no time in acting against him. The presence of such a person can only seriously jeopardize the Congress?s fight against communal forces. Mr Tytler?s access to the Lok Sabha is through the Congress. This access can easily be barred. It is important to remember that there are other Congress leaders who are similarly indicted by the Nanavati commission. Action needs to be taken against them too. The year 1984 is a blot on the secular credentials of the Congress. The blot is permanent, but the guilty can still be punished.

 BEST OPTION

 Buying peace may be the best option in some situations. Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has done the right thing by preferring peace to a confrontation with Mr Subash Ghisingh. At stake is the announcement of a date for the elections to the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council. Mr Ghisingh, the council?s chairman, wants certain issues to be discussed before the West Bengal government announces the date. His opposition, which includes the chief minister?s own party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), wants the government to ignore Mr Ghisingh?s plea and announce the schedule. The parties obviously have their own election agenda. But Mr Bhattacharjee has to act, not like a partisan, but like the head of a responsible government. He cannot afford to unnecessarily upset Mr Ghisingh and thereby push Darjeeling to the brink of the kind of violence that erupted there during the agitation for a separate Gorkhaland. If peace fails in the Darjeeling hills, the elections there will be not only violent but also futile. It may not be a bad idea for the government, therefore, to bend over backwards in the interest of peace and public security. 

 Moreover, both the state government and the Centre need to know what Mr Ghisingh has to say about the functioning of the council. He has been running it ever since the council was born of the peace accord that ended the Gorkhaland stir in 1988. It is a new institution and has therefore faced many teething troubles. The division of powers between the council and the state government has left many grey areas and caused occasional rifts between the two. It is thus a valid idea to have a fresh look at the council?s provisions. Mr Ghisingh is also the best person to talk of the council?s problems. It is possible that some of the contentious issues could be resolved at the meeting that the Union home minister, Mr Shivraj Patil, plans to hold with Mr Bhattacharjee and Mr Ghisingh in New Delhi. It could, at least, create a favourable climate for the elections. But Mr Ghisingh too has to work towards that. He must assure the government and the people of Darjeeling that he has no intention of returning to the violent days of the mid-Eighties. He has an obligation to strengthen the democracy in Darjeeling. His opponents accuse him of holding peace to ransom in order to perpetuate his rule. The elections are his chance to prove his critics wrong.

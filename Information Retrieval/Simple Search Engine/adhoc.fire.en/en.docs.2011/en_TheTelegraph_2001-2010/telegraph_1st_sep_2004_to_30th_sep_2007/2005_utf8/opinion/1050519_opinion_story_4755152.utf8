 JUST BE AFRAID, BE VERY AFRAID

 GOURI CHATTERJEE

 All it takes is one small paragraph tucked away inside one American magazine for violence to break out thousands of miles away among people who can barely read in any language. This is our globalized world, our media-driven universe. Be afraid, be very afraid. 

 He may be a political lightweight, but Imran Khan is still a celeb. When he calls, the press comes running. And when he points out something as explosive as American soldiers flushing the Quran down the toilet, it grabs headlines before you can say Guantanamo. 

 When the alert and sharp-witted Al-Jazeera newshounds spot the item, they broadcast the news to millions of viewers across the Middle East. Not because this was the first ever report of the Quran being defiled at Gitmo (American for Guantanamo Bay). But, as the editor of Newsweek says, ?The fact that a knowledgeable source within the US government was telling us the government itself had knowledge of this was newsworthy.? 

 Except that he turned out to be not knowledgeable enough. Leaving Newsweek with blood on its hands and egg on its face, and with no place to hide. 

 The egg is deserved. Newsweek has made a mistake, albeit an honest one. Its reporters seem to have been let down by their ?knowledgeable source? but that?s how it works. The weekly would have grabbed the glory if the source had come through. 

 But the blood? Is Newsweek really responsible, as the White House makes it out to be, for the deaths, the riots, the increased threat to America?s soldiers abroad? Is the press really so powerful? The answer, in one word, is rubbish. It?s like saying that the killing at Sarajevo caused World War I.

 The trouble with the Newsweek report was not just that it could not be substantiated but that it was so easily believable. The credit for that has to go to the American soldiers at Abu Ghraib, not the media. Nor is the tinderbox that is the Middle East today, when a 302-word report inside an English magazine can rouse so many to action, the media?s handiwork. 

 Blame the media, if you will, for inefficiency, for cultural insensitivity too (no one at Newsweek had a clue about the response the report evoked in Muslim countries). But don?t blame it for a world made dangerous by the war on terror. Just be afraid, be very afraid. 

 Dispassionately

 I have never seen Kylie Minogue outside the pages of a newspaper. I have never heard her sing at all. At my age, I am not expected to. 

 On the other hand, may be because of my age and sex, I do know one in nine women will be diagnosed with breast cancer during their lifetime. I have several friends who have borne the ordeal and are now living full lives. The news of Minogue?s breast cancer, despite the heavy weather made by the media, did not upset me unduly. It is likely to have been caught at an early stage ? she would have been checked regularly while touring for insurance purposes ? and survival rates have never been higher. 

 I asked several journalists in responsible positions (all men) what they knew about this supposedly otherworldly embodiment of physical perfection and discovered they too knew only what they had seen and read in newspapers. They are not, strictly speaking, fans.

 They were not overwhelmed at the thought that the celebrated bottom some wanted declared a national asset could lose its pertness or the shiny smooth hair could fall off during a course of chemotherapy. 

 All they know is that Kylie M. is a global brand, that she livens up any page, that getting stuff on her is only a click away, that the Western media can?t have enough of her, that going to town with this news would be a piece of cake. Thus do true professionals act ? dispassionately.

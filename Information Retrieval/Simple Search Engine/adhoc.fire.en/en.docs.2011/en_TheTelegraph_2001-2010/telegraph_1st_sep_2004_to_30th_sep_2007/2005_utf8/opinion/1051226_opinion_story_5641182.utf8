 Letters to Editor

 In a bind

 Sir ? The report, ?Delhi nukes US show-stealer? (Dec 18), by K.P. Nayar, was fundamentally inaccurate in its reporting of events leading up to foreign secretary Shyam Saran?s speech at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace on December 21. Saran was invited to speak at Carnegie and had accepted several months ago. The exact dates of his December visit to meet with US state department officials were not settled until very recently and we at Carnegie had planned on and reserved a series of possible dates for the event, including December 21, several weeks ago. To imply as your story does that energetic Indian diplomats negotiated a date with Carnegie in order to pre-empt an event on the CIRUS reactor at a neighbouring think tank is complete fiction. The planning for Saran?s address at the Endowment was many months in the making and the final date and time of the event was determined solely by his schedule of meetings at the state department. Had Nayar checked with the Carnegie Endowment before completing his report, this letter would have been unnecessary.

 Yours faithfully,

Ashley J. Tellis, Senior Associate, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Washington DC 

 K.P. Nayar replies: It is perfectly understandable that neither Ashley Tellis nor the Carnegie Endowment would want to be seen as a tool of ?energetic Indian diplomats?. I would have been very surprised if Tellis had not written this letter: to not write what he has written would be to acknowledge that Carnegie Endowment has been used by the Indian embassy during foreign secretary Shyam Saran?s visit. During the nearly six years that I have reported for The Telegraph from Washington, no visiting Indian official or minister has addressed a think tank or any other gathering in the United States of America at the early hour of 8.30 am. But to suggest that it is a mere coincidence that Saran?s address at Carnegie was fixed for exactly the same day and time as the rival event by the non-proliferation lobby opposed to the Indo-US nuclear deal is to insult the intelligence of the readers of The Telegraph.

 Sir ? The fact that an influential US non-proliferation lobby under the auspices of the Institute for Science and International Security has come up with a plan on how to separate India?s civilian and nuclear facilities raises fears that the proposed Indo-US nuclear cooperation might just be an American ploy to cap India?s nuclear programme This only goes to confirm the fears expressed by A.N. Prasad, a former director of the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, who had warned that it would be in India?s interest to ensure that it does not take measures it will find difficult to reverse if the US fails to deliver on its promise before signing on the dotted line.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Experts like the Indian foreign secretary, Shyam Saran,want to maintain a shroud of secrecy around the final plan for the separation of India?s civilian and military nuclear facilities on the ground that it will compromise the country?s ability to negotiate on the diplomatic table with Americans. But were we not told time and again that this issue constitutes the core question of faith between the administrations of the two countries? Why then this need for secrecy if the sole aim is to outmanoeuvre each other? With such an inauspicious beginning, one wonders what the future of Indo-US nuclear cooperation will be. Shouldn?t transparency reign supreme, given the current friendly ties between the two countries? On the one hand, the authorities want to suppress the discontent arising over the issue, by insisting that it is only the second time that the two sides have met, and hence,expecting them to resolve all outstanding issues would be quite churlish. While that may be true, wouldn?t it have been better if the two governments decided to deal with all outstanding issues within smaller time frames, and then evaluate the progress made, before proceeding further? Why this hurry to fulfil tricky commitments at one go? The US administrators may put pressure on India to go through the deal quickly, so as to score political points back home. But why should the Indian leaders find themselves in any sort of obligatory bind towards the neo-cons? If the suspicions are true, then the Indian intelligence agencies have their task cut out for them in the near future.

 Yours faithfully,

Sushant, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir ? It is a pity that very few remembered Raj Kapoor?s birthday this year. Bollywood?s original showman was India?s unofficial goodwill ambassador to the Soviet Union, given his popularity in that country. It would be a fitting tribute to this great actor if the Centre brings out a commemorative stamp and organizes a retrospective in his memory.

 Yours faithfully,

R. Sekar, Angul, Orissa

 DIARY

 One doesn?t quite know what is being fed into the rumour mills of the capital, but the produce is mind-boggling. Sample this. Madam has apparently decided to have another general election later this year (perhaps as simply as she would decide on the day?s menu for her family). She has two solid reasons of her own, it is said. One, the Congress would then get enough seats to be able to dump troublesome men in check-kurtas like Laloo Yadav, and two, she would have a chance to rethink on how much tyaga the country needed after all. Other products emanating from the mill are no less colourful. There will, allegedly, be a reshuffle of the cabinet to scatter more loaves and fishes among ?Janpathik? men and women. Heading the list of recipients is Satish Sharma, who is said to have done yeoman service recently in the Sheila Dikshit affair. Since it would be too much hassle to take the petroleum lolly from Mani Shankar Aiyar, there is talk about convincing Ghulam Nabi Azad to part with the urban welfare portfolio for the captain. There might be others similarly convinced to give up theirs ? like P Chidambaram, Renuka Chowdhury, Shivraj Patil... And our own Manmohan Singhji?

 About another doctor tucked far away in the hills. Farooq Abdullah recently displayed the power of his vocal chords, without much cajoling, in Poonch. He sang some melodious bhajans, ?Man tarpat hari darshan ko?, ?Kab doge darshan more Ram badi der bhai? and ?More Nandlal kaun gali gayo Ram?. In Srinagar, this automatically sent National Conference leaders into a huddle. They fear that Farooq?s melodies, far from having a soothing effect, will actually have adverse reactions on the votebank. The doctor is, as usual, dismissive of all such fears and asserts that his devotional music was in keeping with the true spirit of Kashmiriat. 

 Another person away from it all is Subbirami Reddy, who is once again in the mood for a party. This time to celebrate the first anniversary of YSR Reddy as the Andhra CM. A plane-load of guests, which invariably include mean and hungry scribes, has been offered a visit to Hyderabad and celebrate in style. The presence of the new dhak-dhak girls, Priyanka Chopra and Preity Zinta, is not being ruled out, which naturally has created a lot of interest. AICC gen-sec, Digvijay Singh, is said to be keen on being present and so is the Punjab CM, Amarinder Singh, who has supposedly said that he would not miss the chance of meeting Ms Chopra and Ms Zinta. Enjoy!

 Hot news! Mumbai bar girls need not take to the streets. Our grapevine has it that their tormentor-in-chief, RR Patil, the deputy CM and home minister of Maharashtra, has been brought round to take a more kindly view of their vocation. Senior NCP leaders (Sharad Pawar himself, we are told), have impressed on Patil the impossibility of going back to the pristine ?simple-living-high-thinking? days. The dance bars will survive, but will have to put up with a few ?safeguards and restrictions?.

 Who is the busiest man in the country today? The PM? No, the defence minister, Pranab Mukherjee. Apart from his usual job, which requires visits to the farthest of army and navy posts, Pranabda is almost in every cabinet committee and sub-committee. Besides, he is the president of the West Bengal Congress committee and AICC?s in-charge of Punjab. Not merely that, during every parliament session, he has to act as leader of the house since the PM hails from the Rajya Sabha. Mukherjee apparently has gone down on his knees begging madam to lessen his burden, and the chief too has shown signs of mercy. But the problem is no alternative arrangements are possible, especially in Bengal where Pranabdada continues to be the unanimous choice of the bickering bhais. 

 The battle in Delhi is far from over. Sonia is supposed to have pulled up Sheila Dikshit?s parliamentarian son, Sandeep, for an ?indiscretion?. The younger Dikshit had recently invited young MPs to discuss the information bill under the AICC aegis. Madam had no problems with that. What annoyed her, reportedly, is the presence of the BJP MP, Manvendra Singh, at the meeting. Sandeep argues that he had called in the GenX MPs. But why for an ?in-house? debate? Perhaps before thinking of his generation, he needs to think of the one preceding it. Sandeep needs to be reined in, not simply for his own sake, but for his dear mother?s. 

 The tide has still not turned in favour of Ajit Jogi. A scandal, a mismanaged election and a near-fatal road accident later, Jogi continues to be down in the dumps and his partymen seem to be making things worse. Jogi earned the prime minister?s ire last week when his supporters raised slogans against the Chhattisgarh Congress unit chief, Motilal Vora, and working presidents, SC Shukla and Charan Das Mahant in Raipur. When the PM rose to speak, he was interrupted by incessant ?Sonia Gandhi ki jai? slogans. Margaret Alva, AICC gen-sec, tried to silence the men, but soon got embroiled in a heated argument with ringleader Jogi. It was a free-for-all as Jogi launched his tirade against Vora. Alva is supposed to have compiled a thick document on the proceedings and this is currently in the possession of madam. What is worse, the CBI is reportedly tightening the noose around some Jogi-acolytes for a murder case. Voodoo to Jogi?s help.

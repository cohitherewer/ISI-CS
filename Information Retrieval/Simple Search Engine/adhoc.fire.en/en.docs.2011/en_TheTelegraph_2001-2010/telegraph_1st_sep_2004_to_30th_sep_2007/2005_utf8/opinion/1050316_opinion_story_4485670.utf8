 SOUNDING HOLLOW

 The left?s ambivalence during the Jharkhand crisis will mark it as the Congress?s partner in the latter?s wrongdoings, writes Ashis Chakrabarti

 Opposition conclave, 1984

 It may never be fully known who in the Congress leadership were responsible for the mess in Jharkhand. No one wants to take the responsibility when things go so hopelessly wrong. The Congress found itself in much the same predicament when, in August 1984, its strategy to get rid of N.T. Rama Rao as the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh backfired. 

 In the uproar that followed in parliament, Indira Gandhi said that the governor, Ram Lal, depended on his own judgment to dismiss Rama Rao?s government. Her aides even went to the extent of circulating the incredible story that she had actually come to know of the dismissal from a ?news agency report?. No one believed her, just as no one today believes that Syed Sibtey Razi acted without the promptings of his political masters in calling Shibu Soren to be Jharkhand?s chief minister. Rama Rao had to go even after parading the 162 members of the assembly who supported him, both before the governor and the president, Zail Singh.

 In Andhra Pradesh in 1984, Ram Lal himself had to resign soon after the fiasco. Rama Rao had to be reinstalled a month later after his successor, N. Bhaskara Rao, was unceremoniously booted out, somewhat like the departure of Soren and the swearing-in of Arjun Munda, whom the elections in Jharkhand had thrown up as a stronger claimant to the chief ministership. 

 So, is Jharkhand one more evidence that the more things change the more they remain the same? For the Congress, yes, some might argue. Yet, there is a big difference as far as the left is concerned. The faint voices of dissent that one has heard from both the Communist Party of India and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) over the developments in Jharkhand show how much they have shifted from their earlier positions on the governors? role. 

 All that the communist parties said to decry Razi?s role was that he had acted in ?undue haste?. If you could damn someone with faint praise, you damn yourself with such feeble criticism, especially in cases that call for louder protests. It was as if the leftists were merely going through the motions of being politically correct. Worse, their faint protests sounded almost like acquiescence. After the Congress was forced to ask Soren to quit and give over the chief ministership to Munda, the left joined others in asking for a debate on governors? role. It is another late attempt at damage-control, but it leaves questions about the left?s position unanswered.

 The same leftists were once the high priests of political morality. They were the ones who took the initiative in the Eighties to organize the ?opposition conclaves?, at which non-Congress chief ministers and other opposition leaders would blast Indira Gandhi?s ?authoritarian? ways with them and the Centre?s misuse of the state governors. 

 Calcutta was the natural habitat of such anti-Centre politics and the blueprint for a real confrontation between the ?unitary? New Delhi and the ?federalist? states was scripted at the opposition conclave at Calcutta?s Great Eastern Hotel in January 1984. It is another matter that all this did not stop Indira Gandhi from sacking two non-Congress governments the same year ? first, that of Farooq Abdullah in Kashmir and then that of Rama Rao. The left?s protests were the loudest.

 It is not difficult to see why the leftists today strike such a different ? and discordant ? note. The tables have turned dramatically on them. They are now forced to support a government led by the Congress at the Centre. For them, the Bharatiya Janata Party, an ally in the anti-Centre battle of the Eighties, has replaced the Congress as the ?fascist? party. 

 In Jharkhand, it was the BJP, and the National Democratic Alliance led by it, which were at the receiving end of the governor?s ? and the Congress?s ? miscalculations. Unable to defend what was clearly an indefensible act, the communists sought to take the old high moral ground. But they sounded not just hypocritical but pathetically isolated from the overwhelming popular reaction to the events relating to Jharkhand. What is more, it looked as if the left did not mind the Congress and the governor stopping the BJP from coming to power. If the end is to stop the ?fascist? BJP, any means is fair. 

 In fact, the left?s double standards were exposed by some remarks of M.K. Pandhe, a member of the CPI(M)?s politburo and president of the party?s labour wing, the Centre of Indian Trade Unions. The Jharkhand mess, he said, was the Congress?s fault. The left could do little to prevent it. At the same time, the left could take credit for stopping the Congress from lowering the interest rate on the public provident fund and for forcing it to make large allowances for rural development projects in this year?s budget. In short, the bad deeds of the government go to the Congress, while the good ones go to the left?s account. 

 It is not surprising, therefore, that Jharkhand did not prompt the left to raise the kind of questions that were once its battle cry against the Centre. In fact, none of the major parties used the debate over Jharkhand to ask fundamental questions about the role of the governor. With fractured mandates, hung assemblies and horse-trading becoming the order in Indian politics, it could be just the right time to revisit the issue. This could be the time to ask if any constitutional system should leave important matters of state to the ?discretion? of an individual. 

 The opposition conclaves of the Eighties raised some of these important issues. During the protests that filled parliament in the wake of Rama Rao?s dismissal, the Janata Party leader, Madhu Dandavate, wanted an amendment to the Constitution in order to put restrictions on the governor. At the Calcutta meeting, M. Karunanidhi of the Dravida Munnetra Kazagham sought the abolition of Article 356 so that the Centre could not impose president?s rule on the states on political considerations. 

 Karunanidhi also suggested a major change to promote ?true federalism?. He proposed that India adopt the German system of federalism under which a government can resign or be forced out only if its successor is elected within a fixed time frame. Under the German system, a provincial assembly cannot be dissolved at the ?whims and fancies of the Centre?.

 All that seems to be a forgotten chapter in the left?s politics. As players, if not partners, in the politics of the government in New Delhi, the communists today are a different lot. Like the Congress or the BJP, they are not averse to changing track when it suits them. But their ambivalence over Jharkhand is a signal that they will be seen more and more as partners in the Congress?s frauds. The more that happens, the hollower their protestations of political morality will sound.

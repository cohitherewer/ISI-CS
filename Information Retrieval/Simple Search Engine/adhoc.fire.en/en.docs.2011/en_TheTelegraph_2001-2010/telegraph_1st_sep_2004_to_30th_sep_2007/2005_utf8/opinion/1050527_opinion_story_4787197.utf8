 Damage and forgiveness 

 let me 

 go: my mother and the SS (Vintage, ?3.95) by 

 Helga Schneider has, for its epigraph, the words of 

 Rudolf H?ss, commandant of the Auschwitz death camp: ?The 

 feeling of hatred has always been alien to me.? When Helga 

 Schneider was four, her mother, Traudi, abandoned her to 

 work as an extermination guard in Auschwitz and Ravensbruck. 

 Her mother was also involved in Nazi experiments on prisoners. 

 In 1998, Helga received a letter asking her to visit her 

 mother, then 90 and about to die. She had met her mother 

 only once before this, when Helga had first learnt the facts 

 about her mother?s past. This slim book is about these two 

 meetings, and about the nature of parental damage and how 

 forgiveness might come, if at all. The opening sentence: 

 ?Today, mother, I am going to see you for the first time 

 in twenty-seven years, and I am wondering whether in all 

 that time you have ever understood how much damage you did 

 to your children. I didn?t sleep a wink last night. It?s 

 almost daylight now; I?ve opened the shutters. A smoky veil 

 of light is brightening above the roofs of Vienna.?

 fighting 

 for peace (Penguin, Rs195) by Daisaku Ikeda 

 is a set of virtually unreadable poems on extremely 

 laudable sentiments ? world peace, non-violence, freedom 

 and so on. Perhaps these poems sound better in Japanese, 

 from which they have been translated by Andrew Gebert. These 

 five narrative poems ? what, one wonders, do they narrate? 

 ? were written over a period spanning the 9/11 attacks and 

 the US invasion of Iraq. Ikeda is the head of the Soka Gakkai 

 lay Buddhist group and has played a central role in the 

 spread of Nichiren Buddhism. A Nobel Peace Laureate writes 

 in his preface that these poems ?give hope to the hopeless, 

 strength to the weak and courage to those that have tasted 

 defeat?. But they will give little pleasure to lovers of 

 poetry. Most of the poems read like anodyne prose lineated 

 to look like verse: ?When people are ignorant/ of their 

 purpose in life,/ the deadly disruptions of war/ continue 

 without ease.?

 survival 

 and emancipation: Notes from indian women?s struggles (Three 

 Essays, Rs 275) by Brinda Karat collects a series 

 of articles and notes written over the years of this eminent 

 communist?s association with the All India Democratic Women?s 

 Association. There are sections on violence, communalism, 

 political participation and globalization. The first paragraph 

 of Aijaz Ahmed?s foreword is just a single line: ?This is, 

 by any standards, an extraordinary book.? 

 the 

 confessions of max tivoli (Faber, ?2.99) by 

 Andrew Sean Greer bears an epigraph from Proust ? ?Love...,ever 

 unsatisfied, lives always in the moment that is about to 

 come.? ? and is about a man who has a rare and inscrutable 

 illness: he ages backwards. He is nearly seventy, but looks 

 as if he is only seven. The tragedy of his life was to fall 

 in love at seventeen with Alice, a girl of his own age ? 

 but to her, Max looks like an unappealingly middle-aged 

 man. However, when Max reaches the age of thirty-five, with 

 an appearance to match, he has his second chance at love. 

 But tragedy befalls this star-crossed couple, and desperate 

 measures are required: ?A boy, yes, that?s me. I have so 

 much to explain, but first you must believe: Inside this 

 wretched body, I grow old. But outside ? in every part of 

 me but my mind and soul ? I grow young.?

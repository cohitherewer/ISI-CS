 FRIEND IN DIRE NEED

 MALVIKA SINGH

 The prime minister in Washington, the pomp and circumstance, the Americans bending over backwards wanting a friend in the extended geopolitical region where India sits, Manmohan Singh?s address to US congressmen and women, all made Indians proud of their leader. The content of the address made sense to the political fraternity of the host country, as he emphasized the need for a partnership in many areas. But on the question of international terrorism and foreign policy, it left much to be desired.

 The United States of America has consistently intervened in and invaded sovereign countries. It is the only nation that has ruthlessly carpet-bombed countries where the politics is not in sync with its insular and na?ve political positions. It has propped up tinpot dictators and dictatorial regimes across the globe to suit its selfish needs at the cost of those countries ? reducing them to banana republics ? and thereby forging US supremacy in areas alien to it. It has played an extremely dangerous game in our region with the blind support of Pakistan and the terror training camps in that country. It is only when the terror hit the US that the ?war against terror? took root. For decades, the slaughter of other innocent but lesser beings across the globe did not evoke even a mild whimper. The US suddenly became a tiger possessed when that same international terror hit it. Now, with the disastrous Iraq war on its report card, it has reached the peak of arrogance and, juxtaposed with the complete failure of its foreign policy, the final and inevitable slide downhill has begun for this unipolar power.

 Equal exchange

 The US has never behaved like a mature nation-state ruled by democratic norms and humane values when dealing with less privileged nations. Democracy for US citizens, and an autocratic, often unacceptable, stance for the rest of the world. Today, as the corrosion in that continent begins, its fear of the potential power of China overwhelms the leadership. Therefore, what better foil as a friend than India? Also, the US obsession with the desire to dominate oil producing countries compels them to take India, strategically placed, seriously. The US has always been wary of functioning and proven democracies because the latter are not easy to ?absorb? as client states by handing out little coloured lollipops. Today, vis ? vis India, it has no option but to befriend it. It is a real geopolitical need.

 Manmohan Singh spelt out all the ?achievements? of India and Bharat. How I wish India was in fact all that he made out it was. If only we were truly out of the morass, having begun the process of cleansing this polity of corruption. If only we were truly combating poverty, caste and gender discrimination, protecting our environment, caring for and respecting our legacies and heritage, the US would have been talking to us differently, as it does with China. 

 The US knows well the true reality of failed processes in India. It recognizes the desperate brain drain. It knows that it can lure those it needs for its competitive growth. It also knows who to kick and when. This recent extending of the hand of friendship, the revoking of silly restrictions that it had imposed, and the trappings of gush are for its selfish geopolitical reasons alone. The US is gradually getting isolated in this part of the world where it has alienated most countries already: from Japan to Iraq since World War II.

 Yes, it was a great trip for economic partnerships and such like, deals we should have done years ago. But we should have also asked to share the methodologies that keep America comparatively clean, its museum methodologies, conservation procedures, its success in enforcing laws: an exchange of those real strengths, people to people, that would better our habitats, our cities and towns, our wild spaces and the daily lives of Indians.

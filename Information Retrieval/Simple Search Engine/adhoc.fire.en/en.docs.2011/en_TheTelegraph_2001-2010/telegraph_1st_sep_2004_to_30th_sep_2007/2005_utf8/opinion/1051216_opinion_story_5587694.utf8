 THE RULES OF THE GAME

 Follow the market

 ?Publishers do it by the Book,? was the emblem inscribed on T-shirts that young publishers wore over weekends some years ago. Forget the double entendre, there are set rules for all categories of books, including fiction. Publishers have set formulas laid down to make a book commercially profitable. Here are some rules for three categories that have been formulated through trial and error, with small adjustments from time to time. But the big question is whether pat formulas are enough to satisfy the vagaries of the market.

 For pop novels, the ingredients are: love and power, tenderness and glory, and lots of mountains in the background. This is the formula provided in the endpapers of several Mills and Boon titles that have been modified with the changing times. 

 For ?How to Get Married and Remain Married? manuals, given the frailty of human relationships, this is a ?must? in D-I-Y (Do-It-Yourself), which along with Feel Good and Spiritual Books have now become an integral part of every publisher?s list. There are two simple rules: 

 Be mysterious: Many authors forget this and let editors know they are in the process of taking their husbands to the cleaners. Readers don?t want hard-luck, syrupy stories; they want to feel good at the end of the day. So keep your cards close to your chest. Second, write about your husband in the present tense as if nothing has happened: He still remains ?my best friend in the whole wide world?, not someone you want to dump straightaway.

 These rules had to be followed if the author wanted to get past editors and their literary advisers. Publishing a mass-market book is a big commitment. All publishers are afraid of commitment, especially if they are having cash-flow problems.

 For monographs and edited doctoral theses, given the fact that the market is not too keen to take doctoral theses in any form, the first rule is to eliminate as many footnotes as possible because everyone knows these are just the paraphernalia of scholarship. The rationale behind this is that no one wants to read more than what is strictly necessary and in the least possible time.

 But rules, per se, are never enough to sell the book. There are two other factors. First language, how it relates to the reader and how it engages them. This isn?t easy because it is difficult to determine the linguistic ability of the reader. Besides, there are different kinds of language: the language of fiction and poetry, of sport, of newspapers, of humour, of advertising, and so on. But the rule of thumb is to make language as close as possible to the spoken word and to keep it simple. If this means ?dumbing down? at the cost of oversimplification, so be it. For the Indian reader, simplicity of language is the key to success.

 ?Rules? and sentence structures are editorial inputs. But the market demands more: timing, publicity, discounts, credits and pricing which shouldn?t be too low or too high The rest depends on the ?unseen hand? and matters less.

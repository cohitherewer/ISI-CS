 MIDNIGHT?S CHILDREN

 There are some horrors in this city of horrors that are unforgettable. What happened in Behala throughout the night of Thursday into Friday could head the list. It really was a series of horrors, beginning with a playful youngster having disappeared. Even that, in today?s Calcutta, is seldom innocent. Two little boys have been found murdered recently, close to their homes. That alone is enough to indicate the level of brutal cruelty which apparently ordinary human beings conceal under their everyday exteriors. When Rick Nath?s body was discovered by his neighbours, it was stuffed in a septic pit of the house a door away, with his limbs tied up with torn pieces from his own vest.

 But it was not the child?s killer alone who was driven by murderous passion. What is terrifying is that Rick?s neighbours, who had all searched for him when the police had failed, share it with the murderer. The violence upon the family, on whose premises the pit was located, that followed the discovery of the body has few parallels. As a climax to the frenzy of punishing those they believed to be guilty by beating them helpless and vandalizing their house, the mob set fire to them. While it is routine ? and necessary ? after such incidents for experts to discuss the unreasoning violence and destructive psychology of mobs, to consider the various pent-up frustrations and immediate community and personal histories for each specific episode, sometimes it is not enough. There are some aspects of human behaviour, more intriguing rather than less when they are in a group, that remain inaccessible to explanation. The mob was huge, reportedly close to 2,000, and most, but not all, were neighbours. There can be no shared motive here but the desire to kill, and kill in a grisly way. Lynching on the streets of Calcutta is far from a novel phenomenon, and at no time can the loss of faith in the law and order system be cited as an acceptable explanation. In this case, that is out of the question. 

 A part answer, at least to the question of the unchecked play of barbarity, may lie in the behaviour of the police. That they, including Rapid Action Force personnel, stood by while the beating and burning took place, is symptomatic of a certain attitude. It has led, through the years, to letting lynching mobs, or the overwhelming majority among them, go free. This time they claimed that they were outnumbered, although why that should be the case after reinforcements arrived is a mystery. A force specially trained to handle mobs apparently expected not to be outnumbered when facing one. It must be asked, too, if neighbours could find the body, why the police could not have done so. No one, man or woman, who took part in the lynching in Behala can call themselves human beings. What would the police call themselves?

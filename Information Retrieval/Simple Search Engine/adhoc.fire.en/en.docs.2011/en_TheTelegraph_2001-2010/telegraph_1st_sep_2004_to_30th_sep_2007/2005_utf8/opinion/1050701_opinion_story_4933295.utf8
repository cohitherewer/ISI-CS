 ANGRY AND SCREWED

 An Ordinary Person?s Guide To Empire By Arundhati Roy, Penguin, Rs 395

 What was a suspicion when The Algebra of Infinite Justice was published is now a conviction. Arundhati Roy works better in brief cloudbursts of insinuating prose, shocking proof and daring-do in the thick of happenings (whether nuclear tests, hunger strikes or Supreme Court-baiting) than in a sustained battery of 14 essays. For one, it saves her from repetition (of stock phrases and information) and two, it is less of a strain on the reader who is, after all, an ?ordinary person?.

 We might divide her current volley into two aspects ? what she teaches and what she preaches. But her subject is no longer the more ordinary Bhaiji Bhai, one of the displaced on the banks of Narmada whose anger she was so desperately trying to whip up in the last series of essays (?Bhaiji Bhai, Bhaiji Bhai, when will you get angry??). She seems no longer unsure of the anger of the displaced (Kallu Driver?s pointed invective ? ?Maaderchod? ? directed at all politicians involved in Harsud town?s destruction, in fact, unsettles her). And so, she concentrates on generating the ?power of a dissenting public? ? the English-speaking middle class.

 But why should ordinary people be angry? Because they are being stopped from seeing the obvious ? the way the Empire, that is the United States of America, has been or will be ruining their lives, if not by open conflict (as in Iraq now) then through ?neoliberal capitalism? which intends to ?Free the markets. Screw the people.? Assisting this ?hidden fist? are loyal, corrupt, authoritarian governments in poorer countries which push through unpopular reforms and quell mutinies with the help of vile bureaucrats and contemptible courts. The corporatized media and foreign-funded NGOs are all cogs in this giant wheel. Fair enough.

 And the antidote? ?Globalized dissent?. Against international, national, regional or provincial governments and institutions that support and service the Empire. There, Roy seems to have bitten off more than she can chew. The ensuing confusion is obvious. At the end of almost every essay, Roy struggles to answer the question she sets herself, ?What form is the resistance going to take?? Most of the time, Roy tries to remain a strict Gandhian, preaching civil disobedience (imagine more of it in Bengal!) and harking back to the Dandi March, but the lure of violence is too much to resist. So despite cautioning against terrorism, she says, ?If we are only going to support pristine movements, then no resistance will be worthy of our purity.?

 Roy assures ordinary folks that the battle has already begun. There are people who have laid the steps so that ?we? may climb out of the crevice. And that the corporate revolution will collapse if we refuse to buy what is being sold to us. ?We be many and they be few. They need us more than we need them.? Our striking Marxists perhaps agree with her wholeheartedly.

 The best piece in this collection is ?The road to Harsud?, a chilling account of a gigantic fraud being perpetrated in the name of development. Ravaged by greed, it is waiting to drown under the cold waters of the Narmada. In this ghost town, there remain only those who have not been able to give the patwaris the ?feelgood? (bribe), and so are denied their rightful compensation. Roy drives into the forests around and then into the tin sheds for the displaced families to find a lone Kallu Driver lambasting politicians in his unique way. Did Roy try explaining the workings of the Empire to him? Or did he know already, unlike our call-centre boys?

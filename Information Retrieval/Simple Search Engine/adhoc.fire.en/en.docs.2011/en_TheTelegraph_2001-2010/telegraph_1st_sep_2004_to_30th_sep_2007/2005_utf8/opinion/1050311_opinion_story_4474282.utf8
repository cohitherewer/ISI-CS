 Paperback Pickings

 Cricket in a confusing time

Pundits from Pakistan: On tour with india, 2003-04 

(Picador, Rs 275) by Rahul Bhattacharya is an eminently readable, 

intelligent and well-researched combination of cricket-writing, travelogue and 

political commentary. Bhattacharya is a contributing editor at Wisden Asia 

Cricket, and travels to Pakistan in early 2004 to cover the Indo-Pak series. 

His book progresses with the tour, chronicling the matches, journeys, encounters 

and sideshows. What emerges is an absorbing account of a game and of a process 

of political and historical change, from an individual and original perspective. 

?Even now I shudder at the mesh of emotions at the scene at the border on March 

twenty-third. The faces of some wore a disturbed look. Some looked distraught. 

Some chanted. Some looked plain entertained. Some...were furious with the jingoism 

the ceremony was designed to generate...It was a confusing time.?

Farewell song (Shrishti, Rs 195) by 

Rabindranath Tagore is Radha Chakravarty?s translation of Tagore?s Shesher 

Kobita, his brilliantly sophisticated Twenties novel. Chakravarty?s translation 

makes one perversely long for the old copyright regime ? the yoke of mediocrity 

is perhaps better than this unbridled literary incompetence. ?Do you hear the 

chariot wheels of Time?/ Ever-unseen, rousing/ The pulse-beats of the universe;/ 

Crushing the heart of darkness, as the stars lament. O my friend!/ Time, rushing 

by,/ Caught me in its net,/ Prisoner of the speeding chariot,/ On a dangerous 

journey, carried/ Far away from you.? Chakravarty?s state-of-the-art introduction 

reads Tagore?s novel as staging ?the advent of the heterogeneous, unstable, modern 

Bengali subject?.

Along the ganga: To the inner shores of India (Penguin, 

Rs 250) by Ilija Trojanow mixes reportage and storytelling in its account 

? originally in German ? of a two-month journey from the source of the Ganga in 

Gaumukh, down the Himalayas, past Allahabad, Varanasi and Patna, to Gangasagar, 

where the river meets the sea. Travelling by inflatable boat, on foot, by bus 

and train, Trojanow moved through landscapes where the past and the future, myth 

and reality came together.

 Katha prize stories, vol 13 (Rs 250) 

edited by Geeta Dharmarajan is a collection of shorter fiction from a rich 

array of Indian vernacular literatures rendered into English by a panel of excellent 

translators. There are stories in Asomiya, Bengali, Hindi, Konkani, Malayalam, 

Marathi, Meiteilon, Oriya, Tamil and Telugu. 

I am madhabi (Katha, Rs 200) by Suchitra 

Bhattacharya is Jadu Saha?s translation of this contemporary Bengali writer?s 

short stories, most of which have mastered the art of reflecting back to the urban 

middle classes a version of their own lives without subjecting them to excessive 

intellectual labour. There are the familiar pleasures and torments, but they all 

add up to a slice-of-life bitter-sweetness which can be ?done? over and over again, 

effortlessly and prolifically, in a wide range of contemporary media.

An autobiography (Penguin, Rs 375) by 

Annie Besant is an important historical and literary document. Besant (1847-1933) 

was an orator, humanist, reformer and educationist who joined the Theosophical 

Society, and became the devoted pupil and helper of Madam Blavatsky (photograph 

above).

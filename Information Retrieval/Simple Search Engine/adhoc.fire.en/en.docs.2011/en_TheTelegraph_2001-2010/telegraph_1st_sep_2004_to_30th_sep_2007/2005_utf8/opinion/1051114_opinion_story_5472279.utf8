 NO SOLUTION

 Anarchists are the worst enemies of promise. Maoists in Jharkhand obviously care nothing about the state?s hope for industrialization and economic growth. Coming just a week before the foundation is to be laid for two major steel projects in the state, the Maoist strike near Giridih is one more proof of their disruptive strategy. Ironically, the rebels draw on the state?s poverty in order to lure sections of the common people into its cadre. They justify their violence as a means to end social and economic inequality. They are clearly unable to see economic progress as a better way to end poverty and related ills. But, two things about the offensive should worry the chief minister, Mr Arjun Munda. That the rebels have grown bolder is proved by the fact that they dared to strike close to a town. So it would be wrong to think that the rebellion is confined to the forest-covered backyards of the state. And the fact that they swooped on the police training camp in such large numbers shows the lack of preparedness on the administration?s part. The fight against destabilizing forces needs a better coordination among intelligence, police and other agencies. It is also important for Ranchi to make common cause with governments in other states where the Maoists pose similar threats. 

 However, it cannot be anyone?s case that force is the state?s only option for fighting such battles. The spread of the Maoist rebellion in different parts of the country underscores the importance of a national strategy to counter it. It is not that governments in New Delhi and the states have not realized this. There have been talks of a two-pronged strategy to deal with the threat ? a combination of force and economic packages. The trouble is that while most governments agree on the necessity of force, there is not much political agreement on how to eradicate the socio-economic evils that lead to such rebellions. Yet, these violent threats to political stability and economic progress will stay unless the state shows the will to address basic issues. Mr Munda?s problems are compounded by illiteracy, the absence of a basic healthcare system and the high degree of malnutrition among large sections of the people. He needs to strengthen his police force and the intelligence agencies; but he cannot ignore the bigger battle against poverty and other deprivations. He must inspire the hope that the new investments in the state can touch the lives of the poor as well.

 GODDESS AND WOMAN

 Malvika Singh

 India will celebrate Goddess Durga this week, a deity who epitomizes all the attributes of the female gender, the repository of the many strengths, the special qualities and values that make this civilization extraordinary. Over time, fresh interpretations have come into play, some positive, others negative, but the true representation of the Indian woman is that she is an equal, an ardhangini. Time and alien influences have diluted that image. Aspects which separated ancient civilizations from other cultures, diminished in the modern world where insecure men chipped away at the old root and corroded the position of women in society, by compelling them to become subservient. India too, aped that world and lost her prime asset. We became second best, disconnected from our roots. This led to the degradation in the position of women.

 If Indian men stop and think for a moment, they will find that over time they have insulted all the assets and characteristics Indian goddesses represented, as well as the virtues of womanhood that were intrinsic to our ancient and tested culture, all in an attempt to assert their supremacy. Since they felt insecure in a culture of equality, a strange schizophrenia set in. They became different things to different people. Men in India love and respect their mothers but disregard and exploit their wives and other women. Yes, this is a sweeping statement and there are those who do not fit the ?model? but by and large what meets the eye is this ?hypocrisy?. The newspapers are full of stories of rape, rape of minors as well as old women. Eve teasing (a very Indian phrase) is rampant. Men on the streets will ogle, brush your body as they walk by to get their cheap thrills, leer and pass filthy comments as long as you are someone else?s mother, wife or sister. Before their own mamma they will bend like spineless supplicants.

 Alien bondage

 Traditional ?mothers? find the daughter-in-law an intrusion. Woman begins to treat woman with disrespect, and through this social mire, the ?baby boy? rises and adopts a macho stance. He is spoilt silly, putty in the hands of mamma. When mother makes any demand, even against his wife, he falls in line without question. He is in fact, the second sex. The mother knows that. She manipulates him, twists him round her little finger and he worships her at the cost of another woman, his wedded wife. Then, one day the subordinate wife becomes the mother-in-law and begins to make up for lost time. She assumes the position and rules the roost. In this cycle, the young, creative and energetic woman is exploited during her most vital years. She is abused, made to stagnate, forced into unhappiness, aided by her mother-in-law, endorsed by her husband only because her man cannot assert himself over his mamma, like a wimp. But he can stand on the street, outside of his mother?s clutches, and leer, pinch and rape. Sad and horrific.

 The time has come for the mother to stand aside and assist other women, wives and friends, to fight the oppression that besets the gender. If there was no division in the ranks, men would be cringing and cowering under the pressure! They would then work towards demanding equality. Dignity would ensue. This should be the one-point agenda. India should lead the way and assert the equality of sexes as well as the emancipation of women.

 The reason we have reduced the position of women in our society to this abysmal level is because we have alienated ourselves from Indian thought and tradition. Our norms were not determined by superimposed ?commandments? but that is what we have introduced into life. Emphatic dos and don?ts go against our grain, we fight them when they are imposed upon us, which leads to anarchy and social breakdown. We need to break loose from that alien ?bondage?.

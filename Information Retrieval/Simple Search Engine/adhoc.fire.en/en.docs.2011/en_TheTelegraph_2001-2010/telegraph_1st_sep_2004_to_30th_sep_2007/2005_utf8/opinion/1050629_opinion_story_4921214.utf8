 Letters to Editor

 Sting in the tale

 Sir ? Too much is being made about Kkaran Bahree, a BPO employee, selling confidential information to a British journalist. It is only natural that an emerging industry will have teething problems (Pune was another isolated incident). Were the Western companies who were beneficiaries of outsourcing oblivious to the risks involved? And are the opponents of offshoring certain they do not have a few crooks in their backyard who would do the same given a chance? Which leads one to ask, what is the nature of The Sun?s sting? How true is its claim that the accused was involved in similar situations earlier? And how far was the 24-year-old tempted to create cheap sensation? Or was the intention to show the Indian BPO industry and Nasscom in bad light? A deeper analysis of the events puts The Sun?s credibility in doubt. And what has been the tabloid?s contribution in terms of suggestions about checks and balances to protect British and US interests offshore? Post 9/11, we are seeing a brand of journalism that thrives on scare-mongering ? whipping up and feeding on the West?s siege mentality.

 Yours faithfully,

Sushant Chatterjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? The furore over the Sun?s sting operation, picked upon and exaggerated by the Indian media, about Indian call-centre workers leaking details of customers of British banks, shows clever manipulation by the foreign agencies. Organizations such as Nasscom should expose companies that break customer confidence and reward those that ensure the confidentiality of data so that foreigners can have faith in them. There are black sheep everywhere, but they should be eliminated. 

 Yours faithfully,

K. Sivasankaran Nayar, Sharjah

 Sir ? A question mark has been put on the integrity of call-centre workers in India ? thanks to Oliver Harvey. Is he done with the gossip in Britain? Or is Harvey fighting for the cause of lost employment opportunities in Britain as a result of outsourcing to India? If Harvey did not like Indian call centres, he should have protested against them outright instead of setting up a sting operation against a worker. We should have faith in our call centre workers who work hard day in and day out.

 Yours faithfully,

Joy Mallick, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is good to see the West standing beside India in the call centre information leakage fiasco. The veracity of the allegation is open to question. The news comes from a British tabloid, notorious for cooking up news. Even if the news is true, it should be treated as an exception, as Indian BPO workers are noted for their trustworthiness in general.

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Second best

 Sir ? There are a few lessons to be learnt from the Sania-mania currently sweeping the country. One is that as a mediocre sporting nation, we are pleased with little or nothing. While Sania Mirza?s performance is certainly extraordinary in the Indian context, we (and the media in particular) must learn to rein in our hyperbole. Does losing in the second round, however gallantly, warrant three days of continuous coverage in our papers? At that rate, with seven girls in the third round, the Russian media would have to run special editions. We must come to terms with reality and try to improve our lot. And cheating ourselves is not the way to do it. Lauding Sania?s achievement is fine but we are taking her to glitzy heights totally out of place with her achievements. Only Naresh Kumar, in his columns, has been advising people to cut out the hype and telling Sania to work on her weaknesses ? or remain happy with second-round losses. Recent pictures of Sania show an ample and sagging waistline. Is this a modern-day tennis player at 18? If she trims her waist alone she can take herself a few rounds further and fulfil the potential we make so much of.

 Yours faithfully,

Amajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir ? Sania Mirza created a sensation in women?s tennis when she won the doubles at the 2003 Junior Wimbledon. But her career?s not going as it should have. Sania may be the first Indian woman to reach the third round of the French Open and the second round of Wimbledon. But that?s not good enough. Perhaps the reason Sania is not being able to fulfil her potential is that she is too caught up in the media spotlight and with commercials. If Sania really wants to be among the top five, she will have to work hard to minimize her faults.

 Yours faithfully,

Md. Mudassir Alam, New Delhi

 Sir ? Indian sportspersons are known to be short on determination. There are, of course, exceptions like Leander Paes. Sania Mirza has been so far showing signs of stamina and has held her ground against far higher-ranked players. Take the way she played against Svetlana Kuznetsova in the Wimbledon. With a little bit of luck she could have won the match. Indians should appreciate her efforts and encourage her. Sania just needs to be careful about her fitness levels and the Indian tennis officials must help her to get a good coach without delay. 

 Yours faithfully,

K.B. Goswami, Calcutta

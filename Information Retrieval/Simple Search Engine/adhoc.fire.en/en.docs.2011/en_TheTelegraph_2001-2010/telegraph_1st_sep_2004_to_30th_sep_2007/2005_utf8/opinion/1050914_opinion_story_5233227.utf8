 Disaster Risk Management Programme: A Disaster Risk Management Programme has been taken up in 169 districts in 17 multi-hazard prone states with the assistance from UNDP, USAID and European Union...The states are being assisted to draw up state, district and block level disaster management plans; village disaster management plans are being developed in conjunction with the panchayati raj institutions and disaster management teams consisting of village volunteers are being trained in preparedness and response functions such as search and rescue, first aid, relief coordination, shelter management. 

 States and district level multi-hazard resistant Emergency Operation Centres are also being set up under the programme. Equipment needs for district and state EOC have been identified by the state nodal agencies and equipment is being provided to equip them. Orientation training of masons, engineers and architects in disaster resistant technologies have been initiated in these districts and construction of model demonstration buildings will be started soon.

 Under this programme disaster management plans have been prepared for 8643 villages, 1046 gram panchayats, 188 blocks and 82 districts. More than 29000 elected representatives of panchayati raj institutions have already been trained, besides imparting training to members of voluntary organizations.

Disaster management teams...are being imparted training in basic functions of first aid, rescue, evacuation and related issues...Mock drills are carried out from time to time under the close supervision of Disaster Management Committees...

 The key points being stressed under this programme are the need to ensure sustainability of the programme, development of training modules; manuals and codes, focused attention to awareness generation campaigns; institutionalization of disaster management committees and disaster management teams, disaster management plans and mock-drills and establishment of techno-legal regimes. 

 Human resource development is critical to institutionalization of disaster mitigation strategy.

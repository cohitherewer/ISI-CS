 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the government of India?s status report on Disaster Management in India, August 2004

 Training of rural masons: A programme to assist the States/ Union Territories in training and certification of 50000 masons has been formulated in consultation with Housing and Urban Development Corporation and the Ministry of Rural Development. The training module includes multi-hazard resistant construction has also been prepared by an expert committee, and a revised curriculum will be introduced in the vocational training programme of Ministry of Human Resource Development.

 ...The role of engineers and architects is crucial in reducing earthquake risks by ensuring that the construction adhere to the norms of seismic safety. In view of this, the elements of earthquake engineering are being integrated into the undergraduate engineering and architecture courses. Model course curricula have been developed for adoption by various technical institutions and universities and circulated to the universities and technical institutions for integration into the under graduate curriculum...

 While these mitigation measures will take care of the new constructions, the problem of unsafe existing building stock would still remain. It will not be possible to address the entire existing building stock, therefore the life line buildings like hospitals, schools or buildings where people congregate like cinema halls, multi-storied apartments are being focussed on...The Ministries of Civil Aviation, Railways, Telecommunication, Power and Health and Family Welfare have been advised to take necessary action for detailed evaluation and retrofitting of lifeline buildings located in seismically vulnerable zones so as to ensure that they comply with BIS norms... The ministry of finance had advised Reserve Bank of India to issue suitable instructions to all the Banks and Financial Institutions to see that BIS codes/by-laws are scrupulously followed while financing/refinancing construction activities in seismically vulnerable zones.

 ...An Earthquake Mitigation Project has been drawn up, at an estimated cost of Rs 1,132 crore. The project has been given in-principle clearance by the planning commission...

 An accelerated urban earthquake vulnerability reduction programme has been taken up in 38 cities in seismic zones III, IV amp; V with population of half a million and above. Orientation programmes have been organized for senior officers and representatives of the local planning and development bodies... So far 1,088 engineers and 825 architects have been trained. For enhanced school safety, education programmes have been organized in schools, colleges and other educational institutions... This programme will be further extended to 166 earthquake-prone districts in seismic zones IV amp; V. Awareness generation programmes, community and neighbourhood organizations have been started in these cities. These cities are also being assisted to review and amend their building by-laws to incorporate multi hazard safety provisions. City disaster management plans are being developed under the project.

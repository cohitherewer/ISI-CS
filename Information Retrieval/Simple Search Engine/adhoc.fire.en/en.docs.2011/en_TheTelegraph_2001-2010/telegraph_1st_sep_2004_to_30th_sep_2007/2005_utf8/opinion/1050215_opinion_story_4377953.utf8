 TIRED OUT

 Marxists are never weary of talking about contradictions. But there is a tiresome fallacy in the way the Communist Party of India (Marxist) sought to see a contradiction between development and foreign investment. The rhetoric at the three-day conference of the party?s West Bengal unit reflects the confusion that still persists in the CPI(M) over economic policies. And it shows how much the party remains a prisoner to an outdated ideology. Worse, there is an element of dishonesty about the whole debate. Recent policies of the state government have been a far cry from the aggressive positions that the party had adopted in the past with regard to domestic and even foreign capital. The government has wooed ? and secured ? foreign investment not only for industries but also for a township project in Howrah. Questioning the role of foreign capital in the state?s development, therefore, smacks of doublespeak. Such posturings can revive old anxieties among potential investors about Bengal and its Marxist rulers. Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee often speaks of Bengal suffering from a ?bad image?. He should know that the tarnished image has largely been the creation of his party?s mistakes. The debates at the conference, and the chaos that the rally at the Brigade Parade Ground caused in the city, have clearly harmed his attempts to clean up that image. 

 True, the chief minister himself has stuck to his policy of wooing capital for the state?s development. Unlike sceptics in his party, he cannot afford to have any confusions on this score. He knows that the government does not have the money needed for development. But that is only a minor argument. The real reason for wooing all kinds of capital should lie in the opening up of the economy. Only closed minds would refuse to take advantage of the new opportunities. The other argument, that the government?s development agenda militates against the left?s ?pro-poor? policies, is just as fallacious. It is one thing to suggest that the gains of development reach different sections of the people. But it is ridiculous to argue that economic development does not benefit the poor. In fact, the poor desperately need development so that the overall growth helps them rise above poverty and related ills. To suggest otherwise is bad economics and worse politics. His party clearly is not Mr Bhattacharjee?s greatest strength.

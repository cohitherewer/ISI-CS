 Letters to Editor

 Bad investment

 Sir ? The news that Steve Waugh would open a cricket academy in West Bengal is surely going to work wonders for a state whose cricketing successes are few and far between (?CM?s 50-50 session with Steve?, Feb 16). While there were few faults with Waugh?s understanding of the game, his business acumen leaves a lot to be desired. The former Australian captain seems oblivious to the fact that he is about to start a venture in a state which is famous for shooing away potential investors. Or does Waugh possess some secret to find a way around seemingly insurmountable problems like bandhs, poor infrastructure and a non-existent work culture? Waugh should be advised to continue his good work with Udayan instead of trying his hand at doing business with Bengal. That, the former great will soon find out, is more difficult than conquering even the final frontier.

 Yours faithfully,

Nikhil Sen, Calcutta

 In unsafe hands

 Sir ?The abduction and the subsequent release of Roma Jhawar has opened a can of worms(?College girl kidnap in Bihar rerun?, Feb 5). This incident, along with the Avtar Singh episode earlier, shows that Salt Lake and some other parts of the North 24 Parganas have turned into a safe haven for criminals. Eveteasing, burglary and kidnapping have become commonplace not just here but also in large parts of Buddhadebbabu?s ?oasis of peace?. Even more shocking was the role played by the police in the Roma Jhawar case. Despite the news of the kidnapping, they failed to nab the criminals before money changed hands. It is a pity that the cops continue to provide protection to the rich and the famous while the common man?s plea for protection goes unheard.

 Yours faithfully,

Sankar Lal Singh, Calcutta

 Sir ? The fact that Roma Jhawar?s abductors released her in the end would not allay the fears of ordinary citizens who have witnessed a rise in crimes of late. Salt Lake is one of Calcutta?s more important suburbs. Therefore, the police cannot be complacent about the security needs of this area. The residents of Salt Lake also need to identify vulnerable spots so that the police can intensify their vigil in these areas. Setting up night patrol committees and increasing the number of security guards may be a good idea to curb crimes in the future. Instead of trumpeting its own achievements, the Bengal government should spend more time on devising ways to arrest the spiralling crime rate. 

 Yours faithfully,

Anjan Chatterjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? Was there any need for the police to reveal that they managed to catch Roma Jhawar?s abductors after one of them made the ?mistake? of using the girl?s cell phone (?Gang and cash in kidnap net?, Feb 7)? This would only make criminals more careful about not repeating the same mistake. A little more restraint on the part of the police would ensure that such gaffes are not repeated in the near future.

 Yours faithfully,

Sujit De, Sodepur

 Sir ? The Roma Jhawar kidnapping shows that parents in Calcutta can do little else but pray for the safety of their children. A lax security system and an indifferent administration have made the city unsafe for our youngsters. A few things need to be put in place before the situation turns worse. Increasing the number of policemen and check posts in areas prone to such crimes is one of them. Besides, the schools should also ensure that children are in safe hands after classes. If the government does not wake up to the plight of children, West Bengal would turn into another Bihar soon.

 Yours faithfully,

Shaona Saha, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The abduction of a young collegian in brought daylight and a stone?s throw away from her residence was straight out of a Hindi film. Poor law and order is not the only reason behind the rise of such offences. The glorification of crime in Bollywood is also to be blamed for corrupting impressionable minds. Perhaps the government needs to come down heavily on criminals as well as the entertainment industry to bring this menace under control. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta 

 Sir ? That Roma Jhawar managed to return safely from her abductors bears testimony to her wit and courage (?I started calling them bhaiya amp; it worked?, Feb 12). Her ability to stay calm under trying circumstances and not offend the criminals is commendable. But the same cannot be said of the police. In cases of kidnapping, police often advise against the payment of ransoms. However, had Roma?s parents heeded their advice, the ending may not have been a happy one. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sumant Poddar, Calcutta 

 Parting shot

 Sir ?The Delhi government?s decision to ban mobile phones in schools is a welcome move (?Delhi schools junk mobiles? Feb 2). We have seen how gadgets like cell phones can be misused by the young and the old alike. In fact, the decision to ban mobile phones in the capital should be extended to all schools in the country to avoid the repetition of the recent MMS scandal.

 Yours faithfully,

P. Manmad Kumar, Cuttack

 MORE THAN A TURF

 Forging political alliances can be as tricky as running them. The seat-sharing arrangement that the Congress has struck with the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha for the coming assembly elections in Jharkhand has the right mix of self-interest and the spirit of accommodation. By agreeing to leave the largest number of seats to the JMM, the Congress has recognized the former?s role in the decades-long movement for a separate state of Jharkhand. But the Congress?s share ? only two less than the JMM?s 35 ? speaks of hard bargaining guided by self-interest. Obviously, the Congress would like to use the elections to strengthen itself in a state where it had become a minor player. But it could not be seen to be doing so at the expense of the partners of the United Progressive Alliance, especially in the states where they are stronger than the Congress. For conflicts among them in the states could have an adverse impact on the UPA government at the Centre. It is an indication of the Congress leadership?s astute political skills that the JMM not only agreed to a large share of seats for the Congress, but also left the choice of the alliance?s chief ministerial candidate to Ms Sonia Gandhi. This makes it clear that, despite its marginally larger share of seats, the JMM has conceded the leadership of the alliance to the Congress. 

 Ironically, what appears to be the flip side of the agreement shows the strength of the Congress strategy. The railway minister and Rashtriya Janata Dal?s leader, Mr Laloo Prasad Yadav, as well as the left parties, has cried foul over the pact between the Congress and the JMM. But it is difficult to fault the agreement on this score. The RJD and the left parties are only small forces in Jharkhand in comparison with the JMM and the Congress. Their claims to much more than 13 seats that have been left for them are thus politically unsustainable. More important for the Congress?s strategy is the situation in neighbouring Bihar, which, too, goes to the polls simultaneously with Jharkhand. The roles are reversed for the Congress and the RJD in Bihar, where the former has to depend on an unassailable Mr Yadav for an honourable sharing of seats. In Bihar, too, the Congress has a major stake in rebuilding a moribund party without upsetting the RJD. These elections are not just battles over local turfs; they are crucial tests for a grand Congress plan for revival.

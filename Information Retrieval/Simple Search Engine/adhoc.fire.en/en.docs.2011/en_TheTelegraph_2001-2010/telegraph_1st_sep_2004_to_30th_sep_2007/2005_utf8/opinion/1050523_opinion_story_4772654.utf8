 PRAYER IN CHAPEL

 If taming of the shrew is difficult, taming of the stars is impossible. Greg Chappell has, knowingly or unknowingly, taken on the most difficult job in India. This is because the job of the coach of the Indian cricket team is not about cricket only. It is largely to do with ego management. Chappell will have to deal with the egos of some of the cricketers who have become icons and also of the officials of the Board of Control for Cricket in India. There are people at the helm of affairs who want to run cricket in India as if it was their personal fiefdom. Cricket lovers will hope that Chappell will not repudiate any attempt on the part of officials to interfere with what is his real task. That task is not easy. He has to build up a top class cricket team from scratch. The performance and the morale of the present team are low. There is no dearth of talent in the side but talents do not make a team. Even the best players in the side, Sachin Tendulkar for example, do not perform when the side most needs them to perform. The fielding is sloppy at the best of times and the bowling mediocre. The selection process is driven by considerations of zonal and regional quotas and often the best available eleven is not sent out to play. Moreover, there is no systematic planning to look forward and to nurture future talent. In cricketing terms, Chappell, despite his stature as a player and a coach, has an unenviable task.

 India is perhaps the only cricketing country where the coach of the side has no say in the selection process. Chappell will need all his wits to change this. He cannot, as a self-respecting coach, be expected to accept a side that is not of his own choosing. In fact, in an ideal situation, the coach should be the sole selector and the sole strategist. The captain should only be the executor of a plan that has been worked out by the coach. Chappell may well find that establishing his authority on the team and on the officials is the most difficult and important aspect of his job. Without this authority, he will never be able to build a top class team.

 With the players, Chappell will of course be in his elements. Very few know the game as well as he does. But the coach of a cricket team has to always contend with a degree of ambiguity since the captain of a cricket team, unlike say in soccer, assumes a position of supreme authority. How Chappell handles this ambiguity and what relationship he establishes with whoever is the Indian captain will be interesting to watch since that will determine his success as a coach. The Indian team has got the best man for the job, he should be allowed to make the best team.

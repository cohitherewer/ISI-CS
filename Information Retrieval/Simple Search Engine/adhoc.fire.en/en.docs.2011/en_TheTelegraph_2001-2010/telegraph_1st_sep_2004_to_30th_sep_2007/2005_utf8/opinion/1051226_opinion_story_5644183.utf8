 HOUSE OF CARDS

 India seems to specialize in encroachment, both literal and metaphysical. The Delhi high court?s order to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi that all illegal structures in the city should be demolished has set the cat among the pigeons. Buildings violating legal specifications are a common sight in all Indian cities. They are part of the typically lackadaisical mental landscape of the urban Indian, who accepts that laws need not be obeyed ? the right sweeteners in the right places will do the trick. The equally common sight of squatters in shacks wherever they can be put up merely encourages the laxity of attitude. It would seem that the city as a whole is nobody?s business ? neither the question of civic rights nor the concept of a safe and healthy present and future. 

 The fact that the corporation in Delhi has got to work immediately after the demolition order is somewhat reassuring. But only somewhat. There is strong opposition to the move coming from members of the legislative assembly. The MLAs want the MCD to stop work. This encroachment upon the judiciary?s order is layered with ironies. The judiciary has been repeatedly accused of activism in recent years, and that has been one of the reasons for recurring tensions between politicians and the judiciary. In most cases, though, what was called over-stepping by the courts was compelled by the simple circumstance of the indifference of the administration. This would be true even of the order to demolish illegal structures: the laws for building are already there, the structures could not have been built illegally had the departments in charge done their jobs. An overzealous judiciary may become a danger to the delicate balance in the democracy, for the executive and the legislature too have their own clearly-marked terrains. But it is equally dangerous when the legislature tries to plant itself between the judiciary and the authorities carrying out its orders. The credibility of politicians has touched a new low after recent revelations. So their interference, apart from being completely inappropriate, would not be perceived as altruistic. India?s democracy is very strong or it would have broken down years ago. But constant assaults of this kind, prompted by the purely selfish interests of those who are presumably its keepers, might do it serious harm.

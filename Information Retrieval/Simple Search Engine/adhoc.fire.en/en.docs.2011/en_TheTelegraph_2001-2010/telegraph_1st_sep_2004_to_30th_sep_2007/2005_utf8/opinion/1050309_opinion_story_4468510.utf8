 FATHER TIME

 The sun has finally set on the British Empire. Colonel Blimp and John Bull in the Long Room at Lord?s had denied, for a long time, that the shadows had been lengthening. Now evening has descended undeniably. The International Cricket Council has announced the decision to move its headquarters from London to Dubai. Father Time, the weather vane at Lord?s, might weep, but the move away from London only registers what was a reality in the world of cricket. The position of Lord?s as the headquarters of cricket was based on a set of historical circumstances. Cricket originated in England and is still played in countries that were former colonies of Britain. Cricket was also, till the Eighties, a game dominated by white men, especially England and Australia, and the Ashes series was considered the main event of the cricketing calendar. These circumstances have altered radically. Cricket is now a minor game in its country of origin. Football and rugby have both overtaken cricket as the most popular and lucrative game in England. In a sense, cricket in England has been restored to its origins as a leisurely pursuit on the village green. Australia remains a very powerful cricket-playing country, but the Ashes series no longer evokes any extra emotion; the challenges lie elsewhere. An Indo-Pak cricketing encounter fills the stands, produces good cricket and fills the coffers of cricketing bodies. The shifting of headquarters from London recognizes this reality.

 Despite all this, a question mark hangs over the choice of the new headquarters. Why Dubai? It is not a venue for cricket matches. Before the emergence of Sharjah, the region was not even known for its support to cricket and even today, Sharjah is not considered a major cricketing centre. If the choice of headquarters were to be determined by enthusiasm for the game, Calcutta ? or any other city in the subcontinent ? scores over Dubai many, many times over. The choice of Dubai is also not comprehensible if the decision were dictated by business and financial considerations. The official announcement said that London no longer suited the best interests of the members of the ICC, but it did not explain the choice of the new headquarters. When cricket had its headquarters at Lord?s, history aided the appropriation of the game by toffs with titles. By bringing the headquarters to Dubai, there is the risk that carpetbaggers might take over the game.

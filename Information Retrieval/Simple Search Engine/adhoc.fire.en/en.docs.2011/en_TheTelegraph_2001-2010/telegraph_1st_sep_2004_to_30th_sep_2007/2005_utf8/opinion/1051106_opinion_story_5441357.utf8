 DIARY

 Saffronites have a double-take on the Volcker wrangle and our much-harried foreign minister. Coming shortly after the explosive Mitrokhin ?expos?? against both Congress and left leaders, the recent battery of allegations against the veteran Congressman (to whom the left has generously provided a shoulder to cry on) has made a prominent BJPwallah quip that the two parties at the Centre may disagree on foreign direct investment in the economy, but have no problems with FDI flow in politics. And two, that K Natwar Singh should clear his name, and fast, if he wished to prevent the real danger of turning into Natwar Lal. Trust them! But had PV Narasimha Rao been alive, he would have taught Natwar a thing or two about the art of political survival. And Rao?s first lesson would have consisted of how lucky Natwar should actually consider himself for being denied a helping hand from the party. Rao himself had run miles away from party ?assistance?, promised no less than by madam herself, when he was indicted in a court case. After the storm had blown over, he had confided to his associate, Devendranath Dwivedi, that getting legal aid from the party?s legal cell was the sure-fire way to land oneself neck-deep in trouble. Listening, Natwar Singh?

 Didi may soon have another brother to scream at. Our Sudip Bandyopadhyay, the grapevine has it, is not entirely happy in the Congress as some would have us believe (with Subrata Mukherjee around, not many would be in any case). He has been frequently recalling his days with didi, apparently misty-eyed. And though wife Nayana is still in two minds, Sudip may no longer be averse to the idea of a return to the TMC fold. His nostalgia may have two other associations. One, a redirected flow of minority sympathy towards didi, and Muslims being major voters in Sudip?s constituency, the sentiment cannot be ignored. And two, the leadership vacuum in Trinamool. Get going, Sudip!

 Natwar Singh is not the only one on whom Saddam?s long shadow has fallen. There is the Ghulam Nabi Azad family too. The Azads had named their son Saddam long before the Iraqi dictator became the bane of America. Twenty-something Saddam Azad is now having a tough time explaining his name to immigration authorities while travelling to and fro from UK, where he studies. He had a different experience recently though. At Beirut, he was kissed resoundingly on both cheeks everytime he mentioned his name. Would people still ask what?s there in a name?

 Home truths, and the apex court just reinforced them some days ago. About 29 Union ministers are still waiting to move into their official bungalows because their former occupants haven?t moved out. And with a cabinet reshuffle imminent, some fear they may even get the sack before they can throw their housewarming parties. In the last few days, five of the 19 NDA MPs have moved out, Vinod Khanna being one of them. Khanna, who had his luggage thrown out into the streets, in fact was a ?soft target? because he was seen as someone who could still, unlike his many black-money-rich kurtadhotiwala colleagues , openly stay in a penthouse. The ?hard? nuts, by an extension of that logic, are therefore Yashwant Sinha, George Fernandes and Murli Manohar Joshi who are firmly ensconced in their palatial bungalows, and waiting for the political winds to change course.

 This Diwali, the Chhattisgarh chief minister, Raman Singh, paid a surprise visit to Ajit Jogi, wishing him luck and happiness. Jogi, naturally, was moved. But in Madhya Pradesh also, politicians were cutting across party lines and joining the mutual admiration movement on the state?s 50th anniversary. Uma Bharti and Digvijay Singh stayed away and earned the name of being spoilsports. Arjun Singh attended a function organized by the BJP in Bhopal and earned criticism. Wonder why? His term in the Rajya Sabha ends early next year and his opponents, reportedly, have more punch in them than his partymen, to get him back there. Questions, anyone?

 The babus have never found themselves so powerless. They cannot use the services of the major cellular companies, which have been prohibited by the government from installing transmission towers on public land in Lutyens? Delhi. Many have thus been forced to switch to MTNL. A taste of their own medicine now?

 The MEA mandarins have another unhappy politician to handle, and a person no less than the vociferous speaker of the Lok Sabha, Somnath Chatterjee. The veteran leftist frequently travels abroad, mostly to European capitals which have stringent security norms. Chatterjee, reportedly, insists that he gets advance security clearance in keeping with his status as a high constitutional functionary of India. Fair enough. The problem is, he also insists the immunity be extended to his family members, a proposition unacceptable to many countries. A small metal, in fact, has compounded the problem. Mrs Chatterjee had fractured a leg and had some metal inserted by surgery. Each time she goes through the security ring, it leads to an ordeal. Finicky security agencies insist on having X-rays, causing much delay. For the constitutional authority, it amounts to an affront to the Indian nation, but the MEA, quite obviously, thinks otherwise.

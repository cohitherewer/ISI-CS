 Killing wheels

 Sir ? The comments made by the chief justice of the Calcutta high court, V.S. Sirpurkar, about the state government?s inability to solve the traffic problems of the city, are apt enough in the present context. If the government of West Bengal had not turned a blind eye to the city?s traffic conditions for so long, things would not have gone so horribly out of control, especially in central and north Calcutta. Calcutta is a city of extremes so far as its traffic is concerned. On the one hand, the road space is inadequate, there are not enough flyovers, the traffic personnel are inefficient and there is hardly any awareness about traffic rules among drivers and pedestrians. On the other hand, Calcutta has more buses than is required, innumerable crossings and a large number of people using the road space meant for vehicles because hawkers illegally occupy the pavements. 

 One of the chief causes of the traffic problem is that policemen control the traffic manually in most areas of the city, even at the crossings provided with automatic traffic signals. The traffic in Mumbai or New Delhi is far heavier than in Calcutta, but it is controlled with automatic signals, even during the rush hours. Five measures need to be taken immediately to improve the traffic situation of the city. First, automatic signals with self-timers should be installed at major crossings. Second, pavements should be kept free for pedestrians, who should then be forbidden from walking on the roads. Third, the number of minor crossings should be reduced. There should be a distance of at least half a kilometre between two crossings and extra crossings in between should be barricaded, as has been done in Hyderabad. Fourth, speedbreakers should be placed at every crossing. And finally, the number of buses should be reduced. Else, arterial roads will keep getting choked due to illegal traffic. These measures will not only reduce the burden of traffic on the roads but will also bring down pollution.

 Yours faithfully,

Raj Bagri, Calcutta

 Sir ? Road accidents in Calcutta have increased at an alarming rate. Buses smashing private cars or running pedestrians over has become our morning staple. But the government seems unperturbed by the deteriorating traffic conditions. After every accident, perfunctory promises of compensation are made by the government, which does nothing towards solving the problem. But it only requires some willpower for the government to come up with a few helpful measures. Putting a check on the speed limit, especially in the congested areas of the city, is one. The traffic-police should take the job of fining errant drivers more seriously than they do now. Busy thoroughfares should be made one-way during peak hours. Most important, the government must be able to make the people feel confident about its efforts. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sarit Ray, Calcutta

 Sir ? Having lived in Calcutta for over 40 years, I know the city?s roads quite intimately. I have observed that in most road-accidents involving buses, the driver and conductors manage to run away. After putting so many people?s lives at risk, they get away unpunished. To ensure that the guilty receive punishment, the passengers and eyewitnesses should report such cases immediately to the police. Since any one of us can fall victim to these murderous vehicles any time, we need to become less indifferent and protest when we see buses violating traffic rules.

 Yours faithfully,

Harish Ranga, Calcutta

 Sir ? In the recent past, there have been quite a few accidents involving school buses, resulting in the tragic loss of children?s lives. To prevent such mishaps, only drivers with at least five years of experience of driving a bus should be recruited by schools. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The increasing number of road accidents in Calcutta has raised the question: can the law ensure the safety of the general public? The killer public vehicles are claiming a number of innocent lives every day. The authorities should sit up and take some action before it is too late.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? I was shocked to read the news report, ?Car in canal fall, two killed? (Dec 14). It is common practice to blame the driver every time there is an accident. The report quotes the police superintendent as saying, ?Cars moving at a high speed...find it difficult to slow down when vehicles or humans appear from the opposite direction?. In the case of this unfortunate accident, the driver, Ayan Sinha, going towards Ultadanga, is reported to have slammed his brakes when he saw an autorickshaw come in his way. 

 The report says that the auto was speeding in the opposite direction, towards Kestopur. VIP Road has a divider running all the way from Ultadanga to the airport. The question is, why should an auto ?moving in the opposite direction?, along the road to Ultadanga, speed towards Kestopur instead? Who should be blamed for the accident ? the auto-driver, or Sinha who lost his life? We should think over the situation before jumping to blame the driver.

 Yours faithfully,

R.N. Bose, Calcutta

 ON SECOND THOUGHTS

 In philosophical terms, one can be wise only after the event. It was Hegel?s memorable observation that the owl of Minerva flies only after dusk. Thus second thoughts are the only thoughts that are worth having. Such an observation might sound profound in the ivy-covered ivory tower of academia, but in the hurlyburly of the political world, second thoughts are always seen as attempts to cover up an initial gaffe. Take the case of the Nanavati Commission?s report. The initial response of the government was that the evidence presented by the commission was not strong enough for an action to be taken against the likes of Mr Jagdish Tytler and Mr Sajjan Kumar, who, according to eyewitnesses, had led violent mobs to massacre Sikhs in November, 1984. But under pressure from the left and the opposition, the government had second thoughts, and forced the two individuals to resign from the official positions they had held. Its original lukewarm response and the subsequent volte face are both somewhat embarrassing for the government. They are signs that the government does not know its own mind, that it is susceptible to pressure, and that its second thoughts contradict its first thoughts instead of complementing them.

 Often second thoughts are an alibi for procrastination or even an euphemism for shelving a project. The government, for example, is having second thoughts about its decision to sell off 10 per cent of its stakes in Bhel. These second thoughts were induced by the left?s refusal to accept the disinvestment. This means that the government had made up its mind about disinvesting 10 per cent of its holding in Bhel but stopped short because of political considerations. The government?s first thoughts were based on economic logic; its second thoughts grew out of short-term political calculations. The latter prevailed. On second thoughts, the government chose to shelve the proposal of disinvestment in Bhel. The government of India?s owl of Minerva flies after sunset and is also myopic in the extreme.

 Sometimes history does not provide time and space for second thoughts. Neville Chamberlain, the British prime minister who tried to buy peace with Adolf Hitler, hurtled Britain towards a war, leaving no time to undo the damage that he had done. Some actions are akin to releasing a genie from a bottle. There can be no looking back or having second thoughts. Indira Gandhi?s decision to revoke the Emergency and call for general elections in 1977 was one such decision. 

 Second thoughts are wise but not always comfortable. There is always something hangdog about having second thoughts. Second thoughts in politics are always as disconcerting and as futile as shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted.

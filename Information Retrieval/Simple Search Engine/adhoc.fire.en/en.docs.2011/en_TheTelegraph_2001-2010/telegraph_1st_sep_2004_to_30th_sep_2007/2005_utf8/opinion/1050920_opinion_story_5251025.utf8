 THE CHINA SYNDROME

 There is nothing new or sudden in Bhattacharjee?s pursuit of private capital, says Ashis Chakrabarti

 Call for revolution

 What China thinks today Bengal thinks tomorrow. The best proof, we are told, is the fact that what Deng Xiaoping did in China Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is finally doing in Bengal. A current joke in pro-liberalization circles is that his reforms can work faster if the Communist Party of India (Marxist) divests 25 per cent of its equity to the Chinese communists. Bengal?s China syndrome has become the talking point again after the chief minister struck the investment deal with Indonesia?s Salim group. 

 There are obvious limits to such parallels. Bengal is only a province of India and the government in Writers? Buildings has to act within the framework of the Indian Constitution. So, if Bengal?s communists could not follow Deng?s development model earlier, that was because India opened up its economy some 20 years later than China. 

 Many who now compare Bhattacharjee with Deng have little idea of how closely the CPI(M) has always modelled itself on the Chinese communist party. What is better known is that the Communist Party of India was the pro-Moscow party and the CPI(M) the pro-Beijing one. If the CPI pitched for a ?national bourgeois revolution? in India, it was because its mentors in Moscow prescribed the line. The CPI(M)?s call for a ?people?s democratic revolution?, on the other hand, was prompted by the Chinese model for it. The split in the CPI and the birth of the CPI(M) also had its genesis in the debate over the Chinese model. 

 In the days of the ?half-partisan warfare?, when the CPI(M) believed in militant mass upsurges, the Maoist model was the party?s guide. Those who had known Harekrishna Konar closely enough would testify to his admiration for the Chinese example when he incited poor peasants to forcibly seize land from zamindars and jotedars. 

 While all inspiration came from China, there was just one Soviet legacy the CPI(M) truly inherited. It was Stalin, rather than Lenin, whom the party followed in building up its monolithic organization. Promode Dasgupta, the man who built the party in Bengal, was easily the truest Stalinist ever among Indian communists. 

 There was one great break between the CPI(M) and the Chinese party. It came with the Naxalite movement of the late Sixties and the early Seventies. The Naxalites took to the Cultural Revolution cry for a shake-up of the party on ultra-leftist lines. The slogans that shook the Chinese party adorned walls in Calcutta. One of these slogans ? ?Bombard the headquarters?? captured the essence of the left extremists? battle against the party. The result, as we know, was chaos and unprecedented violence, in China as in Bengal. 

 The end of the Cultural Revolution and the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 saw the beginning of a reconciliation between Beijing and Calcutta. By the time Deng started his reform of the Chinese party and the Chinese economy, Jyoti Basu had begun the Left Front?s long reign in Bengal. To both Basu and Deng, it was a new situation that forced the communists in power to change themselves dramatically. The time for radicalism was over; they now had to steer the party and the government towards reforms and economic development. 

 But both had to break free from the party rhetoric of the past, which still had its sway over a considerable section of partymen. In Basu?s case, the path was still unclear, primarily because he was uncertain if Indira Gandhi would allow the leftist government in Calcutta to continue. The experiences of 1967 and 1969, when two left-dominated governments in Bengal were dismissed by New Delhi, weighed heavily in the Bengal communists? calculations. That was why the first thing that the Basu government did was go through with the land reforms and the panchayat elections. Once these were done, it would be difficult to dislodge the CPI(M) politically from the villages even if the government was dismissed. 

 By the time it had another massive victory in the next assembly elections in 1982, the CPI(M) was more confident that it would continue to be the party in power. Apart from the political gains the Marxists made through its rural programmes, the weakening and gradual disintegration of the Congress at the Centre ensured that New Delhi could no longer threaten their government. 

 With that sense of security came a closer look at how the government could revive Bengal?s economy. The first big debate on the need for private capital came at the CPI(M)?s 12th congress in Calcutta in 1985. Once again, the model was China. Remember this was the time the Haldia petrochemicals project was taking shape, thanks to private capital. 

 By the time the Narasimha Rao government was forced by the debt crisis of 1990 to open up the economy, the CPI(M) was ready to follow Deng?s model more emphatically. So, what Bhattacharjee is doing today is not something that reflects a sudden makeover for him or for his party, but the culmination of a process begun much earlier. It is true, though, that Bhattacharjee has been bolder than Basu and has brought to the transformation the special stamp of his personal qualities. Even his critics cannot question his personal honesty and the transparency in his style of functioning. 

 Upto this, the story of the China-Bengal parallel is pretty linear. Latest developments, however, suggest some twists and turns in the Chinese example and it would be interesting to see how, if at all, Bhattacharjee and his party change some of their policies in the light of recent happenings in China. 

 Bengal?s industrialization is now Bhattacharjee?s one-point agenda. He needs land for new industries and for new urbanization programmes. All this would stir fresh political debates, as the proposed Salim project has indicated. Mamata Banerjee may not be the only political opponent to try and cash in on these controversies. This could be so, irrespective of the fact that Mamata Banerjee?s appeal has always been more among the middle classes than the peasants or workers. It is no secret that her party does not have much of an organization among the peasants, whose cause she has taken up over the Salim project. The CPI(M), on the other hand, has its largest frontal organization among the peasants. 

 But recent incidents in China show that discontent among peasants is not easy to contain even for an autocratic government and a massive communist party. Reports are pouring in thick and fast from Chinese villages that suggest poor peasants are increasingly defying the government and the communist party in their attempts to protect their land from being taken away for industrialization or urbanization. 

 One such incident that was recently highlighted in the international media was the clash in June between villagers and real-estate developers in Shengyou in Hebei province, about 200 kilometres south of Beijing. Six villagers were killed and 50 others injured, while the mayor and the communist party chief of Dingzhou municipality, to which the village belongs, were sacked. 

 That such incidents are common in the Chinese countryside was confirmed last month by none other than the minister for public security, Zhou Yongkang. According to Zhou, 3.7 million people were involved in 74,000 ?mass incidents? in China in 2004 ? more than 10 times the number a decade ago. 

 If such protests are taking place in a society so tightly controlled by the party and the government, a democratic Bengal will surely see the opposition politicians trying to do their bit, especially in an election year. 

 Bhattacharjee can draw his lesson from the Chinese government?s ? and the party?s ? handling of these protests. No, the government has not flinched in the face of such shows of discontent. Much of the problem in China, analysts say, is the result of corruption among government and party officials, who cheat farmers who have lost land of the compensation due to them. There is also the urban anxiety over a deluge of rural poor descending on the cities. Obviously, Bengal?s industrialization or urbanization programmes are too limited in scale to raise such fears. Also, unlike the Chinese, Bhattacharjee has to take care of public opinion because he has to fight elections.

 But the ultimate message from China is what Beijing says of the protests. Corruption and other problems must be tackled, it says, but the government cannot ? and will not ? reverse the modernization process. How Bhattacharjee handles the political challenge to the Salim project may decide how far Bengal can go the Chinese way.

 Letters to Editor

 Nothing to do with numbers

 Sir ? It is difficult to imagine Mallika Sherawat as an actor. However, it is more difficult to imagine her giving useful insights on the budget (?Budget facts with Mallika figures?, Feb 27). Surely, fiscal deficit and balance of payments are not Sherawat?s cup of tea. It is a pity though that she won?t be there to kiss away our blues once the budget is passed. MTV may have planned on her to make the budget interesting to the youth. But with Sherawat around, they are unlikely to pay any attention to the financial aspect of the event.

 Yours faithfully,

 Riddhi Ranjan Dutta, Calcutta

 Far too many

 Sir ? It is official now. India is set to overtake China as the most populous nation in the world in another 25 years (?No.1 in population, sooner?, Feb 26). That India adds to its population an entire Australia each year is a well known fact. This poses the problem of feeding the teeming millions, especially since food production has not kept pace with the burgeoning population. When will the government realize that if India manages to check the population growth, the country would be able to ward off hunger as well as a slew of other problems like unemployment and poverty? Several countries, including China, have succeeded in plugging their respective growth rates, so why not India? All it needs is effective planning and the political will for this goal to materialize.

 Yours faithfully,

Suman Barthakur, Guwahati

 Sir ?India bypassing China as the most populous nation merits serious concern. This would hopefully goad an indifferent administration to initiate remedial measures to keep the country?s population within manageable limits. Perhaps, our administrators can take a cue from China to help them go about their task ? such as making the two-child norm compulsory by law. There should be a reserved category for those with two children and all other reserved categories should be done away with. It is unfortunate that the nation?s precious resources are being wasted on individuals who cry for government support to maintain a large brood. Instead of spending money on family planning programmes, the government should penalize people with large families. One more thing. Most Indian parents with two daughters go for a third child, hoping for a son. Counselling could help change this mindset.

 Yours faithfully,

S.C. Agrawal, Delhi

 Sir ? Experts often say that unless something is done about the population problem, India would face a severe shortage of food. But would an overpopulated India only suffer from a food crisis? Wouldn?t it also sound the death knell for an already fragile ecology? We are losing precious forests at an alarming rate. Additions to the population would only put further pressure on our dwindling forests and bring the country closer to an ecological disaster.

 Yours faithfully,

Arnab Sen, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir ? One cannot quite agree with the views expressed in the editorial, ?Get a life? (Feb 26). The people of the subcontinent are mature enough to understand that there is nothing shameful about a kiss. However, the canons of subcontinental modesty prevents them from performing such an intimate act in public. Morality is the foundation of any stable society. Hence licentious behaviour is generally frowned upon in the subcontinent. 

 Yours faithfully,

 C.V.K. Moorthy, Calcutta

 Letters to Editor

 Beyond the pale

 Sir ? The Louise Attaque show at the Bow Barracks was great, but for one incident. When the band came back on stage, the crowd had thinned and those at the back were urged to come forward. I turned and saw a group of people huddling at the back. I asked them why they weren?t moving ahead, and was told that the residents of Bow Barracks did not like it. Then I went up to a Bow Barracks resident who said that the space in front was for invitees. When I told him that I was not invited, he asked me to enjoy the show and not bother. Since I insisted, he added: ?Those are all lungiwallahs. They are drunk and will create problems if we let them come forward.? Ironically, the man smelt of alcohol himself. This segregation was quite stark, but nobody seemed to notice. It seems that even public spaces are becoming exclusive domains of the English-speaking, ?Doors?-listening, pony-tailed Calcuttan and the lungiwallahs remain an outcaste in ?progressive? Calcutta. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Oishik Sircar, Calcutta

 A royal affair

 Sir ? Finally, Prince Charles has married Camilla Parker-Bowles after 35 years of romancing her. Neither his marriage to Diana nor the church?s strictures on his re-marriage could prevent the prince from continuing his relationship with Camilla. However, even though she has got the title, ?Duchess of Cornwall?, and may even be queen some time, it is clear that for the people ? in Britain or around the world ? there was, and always will be, only one queen ? Diana. The prince may not care for popular sentiment, but Camilla will have to wait for a long, long time to make a mark on the hearts of people for whom she is simply the woman who destroyed the ?fairy-tale? wedding and left Diana alone and unhappy. Perhaps had she lived, Diana would have been pained to see her children attend the wedding of their father to the woman she most hated.

 Yours faithfully,

Isha Shah, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is Prince William who has been most benefited by his father?s re-marriage. The heir to the throne, who is supposedly in love with a commoner, can now heave a sigh of relief at the let-up in restrictions on the royalty. If only this had happened earlier, Princess Diana wouldn?t have had to face opprobrium for her relationship with Dodi al Fayed. The difference between Diana and Charles was that while the former was open about her lifestyle, providing ample fodder to the paparazzi, the latter was discreet until he became a widower. It is a pity that Diana paid such a heavy price for her candidness. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sharmi Adhikary, Calcutta

 Sir ? If anyone had any doubts that the British royalty has lost its popular appeal after Diana?s death, then the wedding of the Prince of Wales would have quashed them. If anything, the British public are more than impatient with the royal family which seems to go through millions of pounds every year and worse, thinks that swastika arm-bands are great fashion statements. Sadly, the new addition to the family lacks the charisma to offset the damage.

 Yours faithfully, 

J. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? I was surprised to find the wedding of Charles and Camilla hog the headlines of the April 10 edition. There were many other, more important events that day which could have been given pride of space, like the visit of the Chinese premier or the India-Pakistan one-day international. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Bumpy ride

 Sir ? The Supreme Court judgment that ??one time payment of tax (lifetime tax)?is beneficial to the users of the vehicles? misses out on one thing (?SC seal on lifetime tax for cars?, March 29). Life-time tax paid for a new vehicle in one state must be transferable to another when the vehicle registration is transferred. 

 I paid lifetime tax of Rs 57,188 when I bought a car in Bangalore in June 2003. I shifted to Calcutta in September 2004 and being a member of the Automobile Association of Eastern India, approached them to change the registration to West Bengal. I paid the AAEI Rs 30,380 as five years? road-tax for West Bengal on November 8, 2004 along with Rs 320 as fees for the change of address. The car was produced for verification thereafter to the motor vehicles department through the AAEI. Just when I thought my agony was over, on March 8, 2005, my car was seized on the alleged offence of non-payment of road-tax. I was told that the AAEI receipt showing payment of tax was not valid. The car was taken away for two days and only after umpteen visits to the AAEI, the motor vehicles department (Alipore and Beltala), and payment of one year?s road-tax by the AAEI, could I release the vehicle. I paid 100 per cent penalty of Rs 5,000 for delay in payment, Rs 1,500 fine for the offence and signed an affidavit saying that I would pay if more taxes were levied. Shouldn?t this omission be taken care of, and the role of the AAEI clarified? 

 Yours faithfully,

Jayanta Ghoshal, Calcutta

 Sir ? The report, ?SC seal on lifetime tax for cars? has some errors. A Honda CR-V weighs 1,480 kilograms (kerb weight), while the Tata Indigo has a kerb weight of 1,065 kg for the petrol version and 1,070 kg for the diesel one and not 1,490 kg, as stated. In fact, the Tata Sumo weighs 1,700 kg (kerb weight) and costs Rs 4.5-6 lakhs, depending upon the version. Hence comparing the Honda CR-V and the Tata Sumo would be more logical, in view of the Rs 9 lakh plus price-tag and with the latter weighing 220 kg more than the former. Ironically, the slim Honda CR-V comes from the land of Sumo-wrestlers, while the Tata Sumo comes from the land of the pehelwans.

 Yours faithfully,

Anjan Chatterjee, Nagpur

 Sir ? It is good that the life-time vehicle tax imposed by the Tamil Nadu government, and earlier by the West Bengal dispensation, has been upheld by the Supreme Court. But there are some differences between what the apex court has now said and what the government here had earlier done. For one thing, the former has not taken into account the criterion of engine power. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shiv Shanker Almal, Calcutta

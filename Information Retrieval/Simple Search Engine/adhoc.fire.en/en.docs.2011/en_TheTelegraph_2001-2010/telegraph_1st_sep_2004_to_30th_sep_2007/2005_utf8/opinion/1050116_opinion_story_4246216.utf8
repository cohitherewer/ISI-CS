 Letters to Editor

 Rising to the occasion

 Sir ? The picture of Manmohan Singh kicking a football in the January 13 edition is a study. Left foot close to the ball, right foot perfectly raised, head right over the ball, not to speak of amazing balance. The live telecast of the Mohun Bagan-East Bengal match saw Singh come forward as soon as he was invited to kick the ball to inaugurate the 2005 National Football League. And kick he did, right into the net. Later, East Bengal?s Rahim Nabi missed a sitter from a position not too far from Singh. When will our footballers learn? 

 Yours faithfully,

 Imtiaz Chowdhry, Calcutta

 Dress code 

 Sir ? The Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee?s proposed ban on women wearing jeans in gurdwaras is unnecessary (?Girls in jeans no-go at gurdwara?, Jan 10). It is good that girls wearing a long kurta with jeans will be allowed in. Short tops or tucked T-shirts look indecent especially because they ride up when you sit on the floor, inviting stares. 

 Alongside, men with their hair shaved off, beards trimmed and wearing earrings too should be restrained from entering gurdwaras. If Sikh culture does not permit girls to be indecently dressed inside gurdwaras, how can the SGPC members permit clean-shaven Sikh men who have already shown disrespect to their religion? Before restraining the girls, the SGPC should pull up the short-haired romeos who often park their motorbikes outside gurdwaras. 

 Yours faithfully,

Gunjeet S. Wadhwa, Calcutta

 Sir ? The dress code for women in gurdwaras is disheartening for us jeans-clad women. More so, because women nowadays excel in every sphere of life. The fears of the moralists are unfounded. Besides, all this talk of morality seems more a gambit by some SGPC members to attract attention and it is doubtful whether the dress code will ever become a reality. Are women in jeans barred in the Guru Granth Saheb? If yes, where is it said that they are allowed for males? There can?t be two-sets of rules for the same sin. Why are women being persecuted in the name of religion? Do such discrimination and unwarranted restrictions augur well for the religion? Is Sikhism being talibanized? The authorities should reconsider the dress code keeping in mind the uproar such a ban will surely cause. 

 Yours faithfully,

Nawaneeta Gogoi, Digboi 

 Sir ? The Central Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee in Jamshedpur deserves appreciation for insisting that females come to Gurdwaras wearing decent dresses with their bodies covered adequately. Other Indian religions like Hinduism and Islam also call for the preservation of women?s dignity by their being properly dressed. Indecent dressing by girls is one of the main reasons for sexual crimes against women. 

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Bumpy ride

 Sir ? The topmost surface of a road is called the ?bitumen carpet?, which is provided not only for smooth driving but also to ensure longer life of the tyre. But for some reason, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation has been laying roads with stone-chips protruding over the surface. This might be necessary on specific stretches to get a non-slippery surface. But it will surely damage tyres rapidly and even lead to fatal accidents involving pedestrians. CMC authorities often visit foreign cities to learn about the latest advancements. One wonders whether they have noticed such a horrendous thing anywhere in the world? 

 Yours faithfully,

 Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

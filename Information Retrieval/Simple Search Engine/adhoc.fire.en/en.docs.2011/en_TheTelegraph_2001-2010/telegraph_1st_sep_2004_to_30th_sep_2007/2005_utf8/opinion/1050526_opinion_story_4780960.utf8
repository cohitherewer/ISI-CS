 ONE STEP FORWARD, AND TWO STEPS BACK

 There is a clear loser in the political drama in Bihar ? Ram Vilas Paswan, and a clear winner ? Laloo Yadav. But that?s only until the people give their verdict in November, writes Sumanta Sen 

 Shifting base

 Immediately after the assembly elections in Bihar, which threw up a hung assembly, Ram Vilas Paswan had said that he was for president?s rule in the state and fresh elections. At that time, he was clearly seeking to find a way in which the single largest party, the Rashtriya Janata Dal, could be kept out of any possible formulation. That did not happen; Paswan lost most of his legislators to the Janata Dal (United) and now the assembly has been dissolved with him ? seen as holding the balance at one time ? coming a cropper. The man who had once made it to the Guinness book for his victory margin at Hajipur is now almost broke in terms of support.

 It had to happen. The members of legislative assembly who were returned on Lok Janshakti Party tickets belonged mostly to the upper castes and hence there was no bond between them and their Dalit leader. The other kind of bond in politics is ideological, but that is hard to come by in the Hindi heartland where there is no ideology involved. Paswan should have known this. He could have kept his flock together had he followed up his flirting with Nitish Kumar and taken it to its logical conclusion. But that would have meant giving up his ministry in New Delhi which he thought was too big a price. He wanted the JD(U) to leave the National Democratic Alliance to accommodate him, clearly a big ask.

 Indeed in the last three months, Paswan has emerged as a man who does not know which way to turn. He knew he had not been able to make any serious dent in Laloo Prasad Yadav?s backward classes vote bank, as also his Muslim support base. Desperate to find political space, be began wooing the Muslims in a blatantly communal manner by insisting that the Congress form the ministry with a Muslim chief minister. Bihar had never been communal, but Paswan?s demand was fraught with the danger of enthusing the fundamentalists among the minorities and inviting a backlash from those in the Hindu camp. Paswan?s demand reminded one of the promise made by Mamata Banerjee in West Bengal that she would ensure job reservations for the minorities even though she knew that the Constitution does not allow it. Her ploy failed and mercifully, West Bengal is not a happy hunting ground of fundamentalists. Bihar, on the other hand, does have a sizeable presence of the saffron brigade.

 Paswan, however, is still harping on that theme in the hope of building some kind of a Muslim-Dalit vote bank. Time, however, is not on his side. If three months ago the Muslims had en masse turned their faces away from him, then why should the situation change in the few months between now and the next elections? As for the Dalits in Bihar, if they had not responded to the charismatic Mayavati in the last elections, then why should they come to Paswan?s aid? No, Paswan will have to explore some other avenue.

 The happiest man on Monday when the house was dissolved was Laloo Yadav. He has demonstrated to the people of Bihar that without him no ministry can be formed in a manner that is above board and transparent. He lost no time in saying that in the next election, he would leave more seats for the Congress. He also extended a friendly hand to Paswan and the latter may have no option but to accept it. As for the Congress, Sonia Gandhi must have realized by now that she had made a grave mistake by not accepting the 35 seats Laloo Yadav had left for her party, thinking she was worth 100. Now, perhaps, she will come down to earth, that is get her party?s state unit to acknowledge the reality. The Bihar Congress, of course, is in a shambles with the president having resigned in protest against the party?s close relationship with Laloo Yadav.

 Things certainly have gone Laloo Yadav?s way and may continue to do so in the next six months too. He can certainly say once again ? Bihar mein Laloo, samosa mein aloo. Aware that the court cases may not go in his favour, he has already begun introducing the caste element by saying ?it is all a conspiracy of upper castes?. This is something Mayavati is also saying in connection with the probe against her. 

 In fact, when Laloo Yadav hit out against the Central Bureau of Investigation, he also mentioned Mayavati; who knows, there may be a new alliance building up there. The Congress certainly won?t have any problems with that, as it is eager to have Mayavati on its side to take on Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh. 

 There is also no reason why the conspiracy theory should not go down well in the far-flung rural areas and so even if Laloo Yadav himself lands in trouble, his party will not. In Calcutta, Patna or Delhi, people may turn up their nose at such tactics but that will be just another instance of the urban-rural divide. And Laloo Yadav will surely say that if elections are war, then no weapons and no tactics are untouchable.

 To get back to Paswan, he also slipped up on the timing of his demand for a Muslim chief minister. The demand came at the same time a court sentenced those involved in the Bhagalpur riots of 1989. The court order brought back memories of how the then Congress ministry had been deliberately inactive and now the Muslims were being told that they would be ruled by the same party. Naturally, they could not have been impressed. In fact, it was Bhagalpur that cost the Congress dearly in terms of minority support in all elections since.

 As for the decision to dissolve the assembly, Paswan has blamed the Congress and the RJD for the impasse. But actually it was his ambivalence that led to the reappearance of the politics of horse-trading in the state after a long time. Whatever may have been the real reason behind the action of the governor and the home ministry, it is a fact that for once the aya rams and gaya rams have been put in their right place, and that the curtains have rightly dropped on the sordid drama of keeping legislators hidden in safe houses. 

 Nitish Kumar must be a very sad and angry man, since for him, it is once again a case of so near and yet so far. But then, he was seeking to sit on the chair through the rear door, wasn?t he? He can only hope to be lucky the third time. The Bharatiya Janata Party is also angry since it could not repeat a Jharkhand in Bihar. ??Democracy has been murdered?, it has said, but then this is something it has been saying on all issues for the past one year. The question it must answer is whether encouraging horse-trading is a safeguard for democracy. Of course, the Jharkhand government will perhaps now have to make good the losses suffered by those who were asked to provide hospitality at various guest houses in the state.

 So it is back to the people in Bihar. Come November, and the people will be asked to choose once more and the spotlight will surely be on Laloo Yadav, once again. The man may justifiably say, ?love me, hate me, you can?t ignore me?. For any politician, that?s the best situation to be in.

 GRATUITOUS INTERFERENCE

 The scarcest commodity in Indian public life seems to be common sense. Only this can explain the over-the-top reactions that have followed Sourav Ganguly?s omission from the Indian test team. It must be the first time in the history of modern democracy that a legislature has discussed the composition of a cricket team. Mr Somnath Chatterjee, the speaker of the Lok Sabha, has decided to allow a discussion on the subject on grounds that are difficult to comprehend. He himself is a veteran parliamentarian who knows better than most the purpose of the legislature. Yet the decision of a professional association was allowed to be raised in parliament. The Board of Control for Cricket in India is an autonomous body which, according to its own rules and regulations or conventions, has set up a committee to select the Indian cricket team. This selection committee is accountable to no one save the BCCI. Yet, it is being held up as being answerable to parliament. This is a direct infringement of the autonomy of the BCCI. Mr Sharad Pawar, the president of the BCCI, did it a serious disservice by initially undertaking to look into the matter. He should have had the courage right from the beginning to stand up and say that decisions taken by the selection committee do not fall within the purview of parliament, and that he, as the BCCI president, had full confidence in the competence of the selectors. That he has done so now is welcome.

 Through his initial comments, Mr Pawar had allowed politicians to directly interfere in the operations of a sporting body. There is something terrifying in this precedence. It is, in fact, the thin end of the wedge. It opens up the possibility of the state ? or any arm of it, legislature, judiciary, executive ? interfering in the functioning of any association or corporation, and thus trampling upon its autonomy and independence. In an era of reform when the global tendency is to minimize the role and activity of the state, India appears to be pulling in exactly the opposite direction. This is a dangerous omen for institutions. Politicians of all shades of opinion have expressed their shock and disappointment at Ganguly?s omission. This might be an indication of Ganguly?s popularity, but more importantly, it suggests that Indian politicians are incapable of making a distinction between their private feelings and their utterances as holders of public office. Ministers, as individuals, have the right to feel disappointed with the decision of the selection committee, but they cannot use their position to infringe upon the autonomy of the selection process. This simple point seems to be escaping India?s leaders.

 It is not surprising that politicians from Bengal are at the forefront of the wails of disapproval that have arisen. All of them are honourable men and therefore cannot be accused of parochialism. But a situation might arise when politicians from other states might decide to use their clout to influence the BCCI. What Bengal thinks today, India thinks tomorrow is a difficult legacy to carry.

 ANOTHER LESSON

 Sudden changes of tune invariably hide a twisted tale. The government of West Bengal has decided that it will not support the establishment of any more madrasahs in the state. This is the last twist so far, and the history of the Left Front government?s attitude to the madrasah has undergone a number of such twists and turns. The spread of madrasahs in the state would have been impossible without the government?s patronage. There are the material aspects, of course, such as permission and aid. But far more important is the Communist Party of India (Marxists)?s determination to keep the sphere of education well within its control. So the growth in the number of madrasahs during the Left Front?s long rule could only have been the result of its conscious choice. The minorities comprise an essential part of the left?s vote bank. The left?s largesse also disguised the fact that the government of the people was failing in its signal duty to provide adequate schools. A sceptic could question the level of the ruling parties? innocence: did they not know that a religion-centred syllabus could leave a vulnerable segment of the people open to the repressive influences of certain community leaders, or did they know it and find it useful?

 A discordant note was struck by the chief minister, Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, in 2002, He expressed the fear that some unregistered institutions could be fostering religious fundamentalism. The political outrage that followed his remarks did two things: it exposed the vested interests of both the party he belongs to as well as of the conservative leaders of the community, and it also obscured the educational issues that threatened to erupt. The necessity of reforming the madrasah syllabus, for example, to bring it closer to that of ordinary schools so that the students had better opportunities for employment, became a secondary matter. This earlier twist has given the latest decision the kind of indecisive colouring that champions of madrasah education would love. Yet this is a decision that should have been taken long ago. A deliberately skewed application of the ideal of secularism for political convenience has made people forget that education in a secular state should be separated from religion, that it should follow a universally accepted curriculum to give children from all communities the same advantages. Perhaps it is yet not too late.

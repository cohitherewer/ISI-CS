 Letters to Editor

 Reign of terror

 Sir ? Uttam Sengupta?s ?To live in the grip of red terror? is an eye-opener (Nov 30). Maoists are thought to be idealists who sacrifice their today for a better tomorrow. How hollow this claim is can be gauged from the fact that Maoists today are mercenaries who are paid to accomplish an unconstitutional task. The ?proletariat? does not figure in this calculation. But if the people actually backed the Maoists, would there be any need for an armed revolution in a democracy? Couldn?t they have stood in the hustings on behalf of the have-nots?

 Yours faithfully,

 Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Island in the storm

 Sir ? The election of Mahinda Rajapakse as president of Sri Lanka is a positive development. Rajapakse, unlike his competitor, Ranil Wickremesinghe, speaks his mind, and to work with an honest man is always easier than working with a dubious man. Chandrika Kumaratunga, too, was like Wickremesinghe. The world, especially the West, expected her to settle the ethnic problem during her time. But despite being at the helm for more than a decade, the problem had not moved an inch towards a resolution. By then thousands of Tamils had lost their lives and thousands had been rendered homeless. Even after four years of ceasefire, those Tamil refugees are still living in refugee camps. 

 The perception that the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam used the ceasefire to regroup is one-sided. Both they and the government did that during the period. While the government did it officially, given the large amount of foreign aid, the LTTE did it from the money they collect from the poor Tamils in the north-east. And the latter cannot be blamed. They have suffered enough at the hands of the Sinhalese armed forces, and will do anything to defend themselves.

 Yours faithfully,

Murugesu Paramanathan, Melbourne

 Sir ? Power in the hands of Mahinda Rajapakse puts the question of peace in the island in doubt. A reversal of Chandrika Kumaratunga?s federalist paradigm is imminent as Rajapakse entered into a poll pact with the unitarist Janata Vimukti Perumana and the Jathika Hela Urumaya. The Tamils? non-participation in the elections will not help their cause. Fear of the LTTE kept the majority of Tamil voters indoors and ensured the defeat of Ranil Wickremesinghe. The LTTE sees it in its interest to usher in an era of hardline Sinhala politics, which will help it justify the pursuit of Eelam and enable it to regain a measure of international sympathy for its project of dividing Sri Lanka. The new president must take note of this and reach out to the Tamils and Muslims.

 Yours faithfully,

Suman Barthakur, Guwahati

 Going nowhere

 Sir ? The Metro rail project to connect Tollygunge to Garia is being carried out almost in the middle of Tolly?s Nullah. This could be ecologically disastrous. The design itself is anachronistic, given that overbridges could easily have been built. Besides, the Tolly?s Nullah is already a moribund waterway, unable to bear the pressure of the population and planners? shortsighted policies. In fact, the part of the Nullah from Garia to Shamukpota is completely silted and has become a grazing ground. Locating giant piers in the middle will only hasten its end. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Sarkar, Calcutta

 Sir ? While walking along Circus Row and Meher Ali Road, I was shocked to see garbage strewn around and children playing in its midst. When will we wake up to the health hazards that threaten us? When another epidemic strikes?

 Yours faithfully,

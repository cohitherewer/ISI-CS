 Letters to Editor

 Why Negar Khan?

 Sir ? Why does Ashok V. Desai think it is important to ?Bring back Negar Khan? (April 5) if he believes that there is nothing more interesting than different human faces, hues and bodies? For one, the re-entry of Negar Khan into India would not ensure more variety. Khan, like the other foreign bodies as Antonio Bernath and Yana Gupta trying to live off the Indian entertainment industry, has allowed herself to fall into the stereotype of the ?item girl?, doing her thumkas with more zest than Madhuri Dixit. For another, the Negar Khans are already here, if one is careful enough to watch the many-hued bodies in the crowd that now traipse along with the main dancers in any Bollywood song sequence. But they neither do flamenco nor mariachi because the Indian audience is still satisfied with the old movements and still generous enough to pay for the imports who do it.

 Yours faithfully,

M. Chatterjee, Calcutta

 End of innocence

 Sir ? It is unfortunate that a bright, young girl like Tiyasa Biswas had to take her own life (?Student suicide sparks torture charge?, April 7). It is only when one loses one?s mental peace completely and finds all avenues of redress closed that one is forced to consider suicide. The problem in Tiyasa?s case must have been complicated by the fact that she was at a vulnerable age ? adolescence ? when the child is naturally under tremendous stress because of the changes in the body and in the mind. Both parents and teachers have to be careful in handling children of this age. It is sad that Tiyasa?s teachers failed the test. Her suicide is proof of this. 

 The teachers of Tiyasa?s school are not alone in behaving irresponsibly. Apart from forcing parents to send their children to them for private tuitions, teachers are often found to vent their anger and frustration on students. My daughter was one such victim and had to go through an ordeal similar to Tiyasa?s. She felt victimized by a particular teacher for three years in succession and even requested me to change her school. I counselled my daughter and spoke to the teacher, but without much effect. However, I was luckier than Tiyasa?s parents. If Tiyasa has confessed to being harassed in school, the charges must be investigated, and not merely by her school, but also by the courts.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? What amazed me more than the fact that a girl this young had been forced to end her life were the comments made in ?Student suicide sparks torture charge? about St Joseph?s, Chandannagore. I have spent 11 years of my life in this school and I owe everything that I am today to the school and its teachers. Thousands of others like me have received affection, support and a tremendous amount of encouragement. It is unfortunate that Tiyasa Biswas was unable to take the ?pressure? and had to take extreme steps, but it would be unfair to blame the school and its authorities. The school is not the only governing factor in a child?s life. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Tiyasa Biswas?s suicide comes close on the heels of the Varnika Gupta case. But this one is more upsetting as it is about the death of a young and diligent pupil who refused to be enmeshed in the tuitions trap. It is sad that nowadays teachers and parents emphasize so much on tuitions that the effort put in by the student herself is never counted. Ignoring doubts about whether the child will be able to cope with the extra burden of tuitions, parents pack them off to coaching centres. Teachers, aware of the tendency of such irresponsible parents, often do not complete lessons in class so that there are more children for their private classes. Emerging free from this trap, Tiyasa tried to do well in her studies on her own and had to pay the price. However, it is disappointing that despite being so intelligent, Tiyasa considered suicide the only way out. Perhaps a more severe protest with the school by her parents might have saved her from being harassed. What is more shocking is that she continued to bear the injustice for two years. She should have protested earlier and less soundlessly. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sharmi Adhikary, Calcutta

 Sir ? I am a former student of St Joseph?s Convent, Chandan-nagar, currently doing my masters in law from the University of London. I write this letter as a lawyer, a mother and an alumnus. As a mother, I can feel the agony of Tiyasa?s parents. As a lawyer, I am deeply disturbed by The Telegraph report, which is one-sided. The reporters should have remembered that the reputation of a teacher and that of a school are at stake. As a former student of this 144-year-old institution, I am outraged. In my opinion, I received the best possible education from the school and its teachers, among whom is also the one who is supposed to have ?tortured? Tiyasa. I would express concern as to why during the ?two years of psychological torture?, no action had been taken to remove the child from a school which did not meet the parents? standards. 

 A young and beautiful life has been lost, and we all mourn her passing away. But in the process, let us not malign an institution or the teachers.

 Yours faithfully,

Mahasweta Bose, Liverpool, UK

 Paperback Pickings

 One of those happy souls

 Fiery heart: the first life 

 of leigh hunt (Pimlico, ? 9) by Nicholas Roe 

 is a readable, but scholarly, biography of a forgotten 

 Romantic. Descended from black Caribbeans and growing up 

 a child of the American and French Revolutions, Hunt became 

 a radical poet and journalist, whose periodical, The 

 Examiner, not only published some of Keats?s most famous 

 poems, but also campaigned tirelessly for Irish freedom 

 and the abolition of slavery. He was a ?dauntless moderniser? 

 who called for parliamentary reform, freedom of press, sexual 

 equality and liberty of conscience. Shelley described him 

 as ?one of those happy souls/ Which are the salt of Earth, 

 and without whom/ This world would smell like what it is 

 ? a tomb...? ?He missed,? writes this biographer, ?the essential 

 qualification for Romantic myth, an early death, and lived 

 on to become ?the last survivor of a race of giants?.?

 The harpercollins book of new indian fiction: contemporary writing in english (Rs 295) edited by Khushwant Singh is ? according to its editor ? ?a feast of Indian fiction in its dainty, delectable and easily digestible form?. The contributors are, among others, Githa Hariharan, Manjula Padmanabhan, Navtej Sarna, Samit Basu, Farrukh Dhondy, Shauna Singh Baldwin and Rana Dasgupta.

 Rartial disclosure (Mantra, 

 Rs 150) by Makarand Paranjape is a slim volume 

 of poems, most of them about erotic heterosexual love. As 

 the cover suggests, the presiding genius is the god, Krishna, 

 although in a contemporary urban avatar. Paranjape blurs 

 the lines between eroticism and mysticism, yet the poems 

 seldom rise above banalities of utterance: ?When her fright 

 in crossing the road/ made her cling to him,/ he found himself 

 praying/ for the traffic to get worse.? ?Sweet Dish? is 

 about a child?s arousal while watching three women cutting 

 fruit for a salad in a ?clammy room? ? and it works. The 

 poet pretends not to take himself very seriously as a lover, 

 like Krishna in his erotic play, but he does end up taking 

 himself very seriously indeed as a poet, and this results, 

 unfortunately, in lines like the following: ?Of course, 

 a woman?s body is an object of desire,/ but it is not the 

 body itself which is desirable;/ rather, the idea of desire 

 anticipated in the body enthrals.?

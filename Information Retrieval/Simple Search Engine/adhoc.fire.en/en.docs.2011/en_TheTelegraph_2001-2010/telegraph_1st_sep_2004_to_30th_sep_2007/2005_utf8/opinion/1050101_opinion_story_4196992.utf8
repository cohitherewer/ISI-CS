 PROMISE TO DELIVERY

 For West Bengal, the last year was one caught in a cusp. On one side, there was the promise of radical changes and on the other, there was the delivery of those promises. Nobody will deny that 2004 has seen changes and that most of them have actually been driven by the chief minister, Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who came to power with an explicit agenda to rejuvenate West Bengal. He has been steadfast in keeping to his agenda. Whenever and wherever he has spoken, Mr Bhattacharjee has emphasized the need to transform West Bengal by rectifying past errors and by taking new initiatives to bring capital and investment back to the state. The initiatives are all in place and the businessmen and investors who meet Mr Bhattacharjee are convinced of his sincerity. This is reflected in the steady trickle of investment into the state?s information technology sector. The word ?trickle? is used deliberately since West Bengal is yet to witness a big bang in investment terms. The point is sharpened by noting the absence of major investments in the manufacturing sector. Will IT alone be capable of spearheading the kind of industrial renaissance which is the stuff of Mr Bhattacharjee?s dreams? The year 2004 has raised this very thorny question, 2005 will have to answer it.

 That West Bengal is changing is evident from the shape of Calcutta. The city has lost that look of genteel decay. Roads and infrastructure are improving; a clutch of flyovers has facilitated the flow of traffic. The skyline is changing and many of the old and familiar landmarks are getting a welcome facelift. The most noticeable changes are in the spheres of hotel and retailing. All the hotels are reporting unprecedented occupancy, which suggests that Calcutta is back on the map as a destination. The restaurants and the shopping malls are full. It is clear that the average Calcuttan has the disposable income to keep retail outlets happy. There is money to be spent and there is a willingness to spend it. All these are indicators of a change in mindset and in ambience. Is this enough? Is the pace fast enough to sustain a take-off? Is the demonstration effect strong enough to instil faith in the investor who is still shy of putting his money on Mr Bhattacharjee?s promises? These are the questions that 2004 poses to 2005.

 Faith, if truth be told, has been slow to stir. Holding back faith is a fear of ideology. The fear springs from uncertainty. Nobody is quite sure how far Mr Bhattacharjee will be able to carry his party with him. What happens if the comrades in New Delhi prevail? The uncertainty is exacerbated by West Bengal occasionally lapsing into its past. Witness the spate of bandhs in the second half of November and early December. If 2004 was the year of promise, 2005 has to be the year of delivery. Mr Bhattacharjee has miles to go before his dreams become reality for West Bengal.

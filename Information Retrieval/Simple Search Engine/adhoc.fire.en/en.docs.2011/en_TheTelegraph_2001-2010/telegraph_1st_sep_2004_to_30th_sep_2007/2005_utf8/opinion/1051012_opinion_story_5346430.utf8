 KEEPING FUNDS READY AT HAND

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the government of India?s status report on Disaster Management in India, August 2004

 Pursuant to the recommendations of the Eleventh Finance Commission, apart from the CRF, a National Calamity Contingency Fund Scheme came into force with effect from the financial year 2000-01 and would be operative till the end of the financial year 2004-05. NCCF is intended to cover natural calamities like cyclone, drought, earthquake, fire, flood and hailstorm, which are considered to be of severe nature requiring expenditure by the state government in excess of the balances available in its own calamity relief fund.

 The assistance from NCCF is available only for immediate relief and rehabilitation. Any reconstruction of assets or restoration of damaged capital should be financed through the re-allocation of plan funds... The initial corpus of the national fund is Rs 500 crore, provided by the government of India. This fund is required to be recouped by levy of special surcharge for a limited period on central taxes. An amount of about Rs 2,300 crore has already been released to states from NCCF. A list of items and norms of expenditure for assistance chargeable to CRF/NCCF in the wake of natural calamities is prescribed in detail from time to time. 

 Financing of disaster management through five year plans: Although not specifically addressed in five year plan documents in the past, the government of India has a long history of using funds from the plan for mitigating natural disasters. Funds are provided under plan schemes, that is various schemes of government of India, such as for drinking water, employment generation, inputs for agriculture and flood control measures etc. There are also facilities for rescheduling short-term loans taken for agriculture purposes upon certification by the district/state administration. Central government?s assets/ infrastructure are to be repaired/rectified by the respective ministry/department of government of India. Besides this, at the occurrence of a calamity of great magnitude, funds flow from donors, both local and international, for relief and rehabilitation, and in few cases for long-term preparedness/preventive measures. Funds for the latter purposes are also available from multilateral funding agencies such as the World Bank. These form part of the state plan.

 There are also a number of important ongoing schemes that specifically help reduce disaster vulnerability. Some of these are: Integrated Wasteland Development Programme (IWDP), Drought Prone Area Programme (DPAP), Desert Development Programme (DDP), Flood Control Programmes, National Afforestation amp; Ecodevelopment Programme (NA amp;ED), Accelerated Rural Water Supply Programme (ARWSP), Crop Insurance, Sampurn Grameen Rozgar Yojana (SGRY), Food for Work etc. 

 Initiatives proposed by various bodies regarding financing under the plan: References have recently been made to the role of the plan in disaster management by the high power committee (HPC) on disaster management, as well as by the Eleventh Finance Commission. The HPC was constituted in 1999 and submitted its report in October 2001. The HPC took an overview of all recent disasters (natural as well as manmade) in the country and identified common response and preparedness mechanisms on the basis of a series of consultations with a number of government, non-government, national and international agencies and media organizations. An important recommendation of the committee was that at least 10 per cent of plan funds at the national, state and district levels be earmarked and apportioned for schemes which specifically address areas such as prevention, reduction, preparedness and mitigation of disasters.

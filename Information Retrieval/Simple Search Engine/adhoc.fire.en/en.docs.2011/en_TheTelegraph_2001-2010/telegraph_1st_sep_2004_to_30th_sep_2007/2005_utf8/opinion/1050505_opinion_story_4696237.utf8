 BRITAIN IN LABOUR

 A neologism derived from Indian politics seems poised as the most acceptable explanation for developments in British politics. This is the TINA factor, which, spelt out, means there is no alternative. Mr Tony Blair, the prime minister of Great Britain, might get another opportunity to kiss the hands of Regina Elizabeth after the polls today because of the TINA factor. It is clear from every possible index, quantitative and qualitative, that Mr Blair?s popularity is nowhere near what it was when he first came to power in 1997. Indeed, it is not even at the level it was before the Iraq war. Yet, the chances are that, barring a complete upset, Mr Blair will remain the occupant of 10, Downing Street after the results of the polls. But for this, no credit will accrue to Mr Blair. He should in fact thank his opposition, which has failed to provide a viable and an effective alternative to Mr Blair and his government. This is ironic since Mr Blair?s success is in a large measure due to policies that originated under Ms Margaret Thatcher?s Tory government. To this pro-market Tory legacy of Mr Blair was added the unique contribution of Mr Blair?s chancellor of the exchequer, Mr Gordon Brown. The latter allowed the Bank of England to determine monetary policy and kept a firm hold on public spending and taxation. The chemistry of this compound has made Mr Blair appear almost invincible.

 Mr Blair has been his own worst enemy. He dragged Britain into an unnecessary war, and may even have been economical with the truth to garner public opinion in favour of his decision to make Britain a poodle of the White House in Washington DC. His opponents, principally the Conservative Party, have failed to capitalize on the prime minister?s weaknesses. The leader of the Conservative Party, Mr Michael Howard, has yielded a part of his turf by opposing Mr Blair?s policy of allowing universities to charge British students. One of Mr Howard?s distinguished predecessors, now a baroness, would have welcomed such a policy. Mr Howard?s defensiveness and the poverty of his ideas are evident in his raising of the Tory populist flag of immigration. Support to the Tories is now reduced to the country which was the original base of the Tory party. In the absence of an alternative, Mr Blair may not exactly romp into the House of Commons but he will be there alright. A reduced majority is better than no majority.

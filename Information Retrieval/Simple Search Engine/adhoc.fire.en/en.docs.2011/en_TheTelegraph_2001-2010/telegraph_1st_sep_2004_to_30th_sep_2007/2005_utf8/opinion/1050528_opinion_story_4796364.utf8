 Out and About

 If you thought Indian audiences had eyes ? and ears ? only for teeny-boppers, think again. Or rather, dont bother. Just catch grand old man of pop Engelbert Humperdinck at what promises to be another electrifying performance, when he comes acalling on India next month. Pity the audience will be composed mainly of dotards. Born in India in 1936, the singer returns to home turf for the first time to perform in aid of the victims of last years tsunami. He wont touch down in Chennai, though, the city in which he was born. Nonetheless, going by Indias fascination for oldies, we wonder whos next in line. The Ventures?

 Sylvester Stallone

 If this isnt a kayo, tell us what is. Sylvester Stallone ? bored, seemingly, with his umpteen guns gore roles ? has decided to flex his brain muscles and come up with a script on the life of Edgar Allen Poe. Whats more, Stallone, apparently, has always nursed a soft spot for the celebrated 19th-century American author. And its not just the script ? the brawny heartthrob even plans to produce and distribute the film. But the bad (or maybe the good) news is that he doesnt want to act as Poe in the film. For that, Stallone has his sights set on Robert Downing Jr. So, whats next? Suniel Shetty spinning out one on Saratchandra?

 Padgaonkar

 Another journo-turned-author? Columnist Dilip Padgaonkar, the grapevine has it, is getting down to write a book on M.L. Mittal, father of steel baron Lakshmi Mittal. Padgaonkar, however, says the project is still in its nascent stages, and its way too early to comment.

 Fine.

 Well wait...

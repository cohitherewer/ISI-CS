 Letters to Editor

 Safety first

 Sir ? A matter of immense public import was conspicuously absent in ?Ruptured condoms? Back-ups here? (Sept 3), which talked about the comparative advantages of the oral contraceptive pill over condoms. There can be no dispute over the fact that in a country like India, where population control is a vital issue, introduction of the ?morning after? pill is a positive development. But has anyone thought about the medical risks? The use of condoms should always be promoted in India, not merely because they prevent unwanted pregnancies, but because they also have a function in preventing sexually transmitted diseases like AIDS. The report ignores this aspect. One would however hope that doctors in India are not oblivious of this medical fact when advising their patients on the modes of contraception. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Kunal Saha, Ohio, US

 Whose story?

 Sir ? Being one of the most vocal proponents of Hindutva, Swapan Dasgupta finds it necessary to take up the cudgels on behalf of the sangh parivar. And history, of course, has remained his favourite battleground. In ?Heroes and charlatans? (Sept 9), Dasgupta has questioned the ?priorities and pre-occupations of the professional historians?, whose aim is to make history scientific. And that, Dasgupta believes, has made history unintelligible and rarefied. History, he thinks, no longer tells the story of real men and women. 

 This reveals a basic inadequacy in Dasgupta?s understanding of history. History is based on facts and a historian can choose only those facts which are backed by evidence. Under no circumstance can he manufacture them, which unfortunately has become the priority and preoccupation of the saffron pamphleteers. Making history scientific is however not to deny great individuals their rightful place in it but to discard the custom of falsely glorifying kings and queens. A historian is not only a mere chronicler of lives, but also an explorer of facts so as to offer a ringside view of the social, cultural and political life of a bygone era. However, historians aspire to accomplish something more. As Eric Hobsbawm pointed out, ?What goes into school textbooks and politicians? speeches about the past, the material for writers of fiction, makers of TV programmes and videos, comes ultimately from historians.? Hence, a novelist writing a novel on past occurrences is not in conflict with historians writing ?real? history. An intelligent reader, however, is able to distinguish between the work of imagination and that of history. But it would be too much to expect an ?Amar Chitra Katha? reader to comprehend A.L. Basham. 

 The real threat to liberal history-writing originates from those who place their absolute faith in ?their culture? above evidence from carbon-dating, mitochondrial DNA and archaeological analysis of pottery. To promote history and its analysis as ?fun? sends wrong signals to people. Dasgupta?s philosophical problems with history-writing is actually a smokescreen to hide saffronite attempts to destroy the role of scientific evidence in history-writing, to blur the distinction between fact and fiction.

 Yours faithfully,

Rajarshi Sengupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? The aim of history is not to strengthen legends and myths, but to weaken them. A historian needs to be imaginative, but at the same time, history-writing cannot be based on one?s fertile imagination. It has to be substantiated by evidence of cognizable nature. An existent past can be interpreted from different standpoints, but a non-existent one cannot be invented. There are various trends in history-writing today. There are some historians who emphasize on a mega-narrative. To them, the state and centralizing ideologies are important concerns. There are again others writing history from a different perspective, for example those of the marginalized sections of society. But a grand ideology does not negate the presence of other ideologies. At the same time, it is difficult to accept the reductionist tendency in history-writing totally. If we advocate extreme peripherality, there will be nothing left as the subject matter of history. We can only admit that the vicissitudes of time have resulted in various identity-formations, which in turn have produced different histories. 

 Yours faithfully,

Paresh Malakar, Guwahati

 Alms and them

 Sir ? If K.P. Nayar were so worried about the poverty of India, he should have asked the same question to poorer nations like Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Thailand when they too extended a helping hand to the Americans for relief (?Morally repugnant?, Sept 7). Surely, $ 5 million is not a big thing. But it is probably the gesture which matters more.

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? India?s donation is like alms from a fakir to a king. Katrina has been blown out of proportion by the world media simply because it happened in the world?s richest nation. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shivaji K. Moitra, Kharagpur

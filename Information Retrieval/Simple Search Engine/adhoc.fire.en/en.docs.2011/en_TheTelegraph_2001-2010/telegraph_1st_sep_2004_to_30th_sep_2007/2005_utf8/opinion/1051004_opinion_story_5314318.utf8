 GROWING WELL

 The Reserve Bank of India expected real gross domestic product growth to be around 7 per cent in 2005-06. The Q1 figures for 2005-06, with growth of 8.1 per cent, have surpassed expectations and have been driven by industry and services. The usual caveats are in order. In these versions of the Central Statistical Organization?s advance estimates, industry is satisfactorily captured only through manufacturing, agriculture and allied activities through crop output and services through finance, insurance, real estate and business services, although other service sector figures are also available. Eventually, numbers will change, but good news will remain. The bad news is in crop output. Compared to 3.8 per cent registered in Q1 of 2004-05, agriculture grew by 2 per cent. So far, signs are that kharif prospects for 2005-06 will be good. Not only has the south-west monsoon recovered, there have been increases in minimum support prices. Given better kharif prospects, plus-3 per cent agricultural growth for 2005-06 is eminently possible. This does not negate the broader agricultural problem, a priority area for the United Progressive Alliance, or the need for further rural sector reforms.

 Manufacturing grew by 11.3 per cent in Q1, after 7.9 per cent in Q1 of 2004-05. Other industrial sectors, electricity, gas and water supply and mining and quarrying did not do that well. The index of industrial production, available till July, shows 9.3 per cent growth for April-July. High non-oil imports, growth in non-food credit, increase in capital goods production, increased investments, robust exports and corporate performance measures, are all indicators that manufacturing can achieve the 12 per cent envisaged in National Manufacturing Competitiveness Council?s strategy paper. But constraints are infrastructure sectors and high fiscal deficits. There are also questions about whether the investment spurt is cyclical or structural, with hardening of interest rates eminently possible. The services sector grew at 8 per cent in Q1 of 2005-06, compared to 9.1 per cent a year earlier. In 2003-04, driven by spectacular agricultural performance on a low base, the economy grew by 8.5 per cent. But that year industry did not do that well. With industry performing better and agriculture unlikely to be a disaster, there is no reason why growth in 2005-06 should not approach 8 per cent. In spite of the UPA.

 LANGUAGE BAR

 Home science does not need to be learnt in colleges. Nor psychology, evidently, because Kamala Nehru College in Bhubaneswar has dropped both subjects from its degree course. The moral of this could have been that women can learn both on the job. But this thought-provoking ? or simply provoking ? moral has to be abandoned in the face of harsh realities. In its bid to reform the education system and rationalize the student-teacher ratio, the Orissa government has asked government and government-aided colleges across the state not to teach subjects that have a low student enrolment rate. The real lesson, which should be drawn from the list of subjects to be dropped in the different colleges in the coming academic year, is that very few young people want to study Oriya. Neither Ravenshaw College in Cuttack nor Fakir Mohan College in Balasore will offer degree courses in Oriya anymore. The same decision has been taken by 138 other colleges. This is a bewildering signpost in the course of Orissa?s history, since the boundaries of the modern state were determined on the basis of language. 

 Given the lack of interest in Oriya, it is not surprising that Ravenshaw College has been compelled to drop the Bengali and Urdu courses too. But the fact that mathematics comes a close second to Oriya in unpopularity among aspiring young scholars may strike an observer as equally intriguing. Economics has completely lost its demand among women, so it will be dropped in a large number of women?s colleges. It would seem that higher education in Orissa is veering away from scholarship in certain fundamental areas, literature or mathematics, for example. At the same time, women?s lack of interest in economics suggests gender bias even in a ?modern? subject. But the drop in the demand for Oriya is the most remarkable, especially because students in government colleges come both from the cities and the villages. This is an indication of a cultural shift. Perhaps Mr Naveen Patnaik?s influence on the culture of the state has been deeper than expected. Certainly the lack of debate, let alone outrage or regret, at the decision to drop Oriya would suggest this. The system is undoubtedly rational: those who want to study Oriya in college, will have to find one that offers the course. The teacher-student ratio would then be perfect. And perhaps entry into the globalized world trouble-free.

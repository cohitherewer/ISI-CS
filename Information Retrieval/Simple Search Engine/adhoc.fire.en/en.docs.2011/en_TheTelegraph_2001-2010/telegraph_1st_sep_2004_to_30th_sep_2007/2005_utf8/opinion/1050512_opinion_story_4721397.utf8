 Letters to Editor

 Not spoilt for choice

 Sir ? Personalities, and not performance, matter in elections in India. But Mamata Banerjee, despite being an old hand, seems to have forgotten this cardinal rule (?David versus Goliath in mayor?s ward?, May 11). What else can explain didi nominating Kakali Ghosh Dastidar to take on the mayor who has a larger-than-life image in state politics? What made the Trinamool Congress chief field this ?formidable? opponent? Does it have to do with Ghosh Dastidar curing didi of her imaginary ailments? Or was it because Sobhondeb Chattopadhyay, who was Mamata?s original choice, turned tail and fled fearing a drubbing at the mayor?s hand? The Trinamool Congress chief, who had described Mukherjee as a ?traitor? earlier, seems to be unaware of the fact that she too is guilty of scuttling the party?s chances in the coming elections by pitching minnows in the fray.

 Yours faithfully,

 Arnab Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Together alone

 Sir ? The All India Muslim Personal Law Board has given the triple talaq a quiet burial and opted for the model nikaahnama (marriage contract system) instead. But one wonders whether this will help eradicate the practice of talaq at all. The board has now made it mandatory for married couples to approach the local qazi or family courts to settle marital disputes. 

 However, it would have been better if these disputes were settled in civil courts, rather than by partisan qazis who are often guilty of advocating talaq. The reforms, quite justifiably, have left Muslim women?s rights activists disappointed. Perhaps there is a case for the government to press for a uniform civil code which would ensure that Muslim women get a fair deal in the event of a divorce.

 Yours faithfully,

Omar Luther King, Delhi 

 Sir ?The fact that it is now curtains for the system of triple talaq means that Muslim women can now look forward to a better life. For a long time now, Muslim women were treated unfairly by a patriarchal social set up. While the men practise polygamy with impunity, the women remain silent for the fear of being ostracized. But this would now stop with the model nikaahnama making it difficult for Muslim men to divorce their wives as and when they want, and ensuring that women are treated in a just manner. 

 The AIMPLB deserves praise for bringing about an important change in the laws. But the icing of the cake would really be if the board abolished the monstrous practice of polygamy as well.

 Yours faithfully,

Sharmi Adhikary, Calcutta

 Sir ?The purging of triple talaq has ushered in a new era for Muslim women. However, certain problems remain. First, the AIMPLB, which has no statutory power to enforce the model nikaahnama, may find it difficult to stop talaq in each and every Muslim family. Moreover, Muslim society, like most others, treat women as second class citizens and it is unlikely that it would accept the change without a murmur of protest. But the board did not make it known how it proposes to meet this challenge while implementing this crucial piece of legislation.

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? The AIMPLB resorts to doublespeak when it comes to the issue of women?s welfare. On the one hand, the board has done away with the practice of triple talaq by implementing the model nikaahnama. On the other, it has aired reservations about abrogating child marriage and fixing 18 years as the legal age of consent for Muslim girls. It is difficult to see how the board would go about protecting women?s rights considering it endorses early marriage for women and is opposed to a bill which aims at preventing child marriage. There can be very little progress if the board itself chooses to speak in such a contradictory manner. It seems that the members of the board are unaware of the fact that traditional practices like the talaq nurture other malpractices such as child marriage. Young girls, who have neither money nor education, are often the victims of talaq. Hence, the board?s move to eliminate talaq would remain largely cosmetic if other social maladies like child marriages are not done away with.

 Yours faithfully,

Rashmi Jaiswal, Howrah

 Sir ?That the AIMPLB has decided to document all marriages in the community, secure women?s inheritance rights and get rid of talaq is welcome news. But these measures, which have taken a long time to come, are not enough to empower Muslim women. This is borne out by a simple fact. Muslim women are still debarred from initiating divorce proceedings in India, the new model nikaahnama notwithstanding. 

 More important, they are poorly represented within the decision-making bodies of the minority community. One only has to look at the number of women members in the law board to understand their predicament. Unless more women manage to find a voice within the community, the chances of their emancipation would continue to remain slim.

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

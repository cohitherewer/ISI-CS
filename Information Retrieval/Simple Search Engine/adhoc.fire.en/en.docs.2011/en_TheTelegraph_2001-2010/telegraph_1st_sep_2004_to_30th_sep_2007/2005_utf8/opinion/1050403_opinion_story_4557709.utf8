 Letters to Editor

 Fool?s paradise

 Sir ? It seems that it pays to get fooled these days. Recently, a radio channel invited callers to share their experiences of All Fools day on April 1, promising a fat reward for the ?best entry?. Soon enough, there was a deluge of calls from excited callers who wanted to let the world know about how they had been conned. It?s a pity that we continue to make our most private moments ? of love, loss and even embarrassment ? public. Why then do we scream ourselves hoarse when the media go about their sting operations?

 Yours faithfully,

 Troubled teens

 Sir ? The report, ?Girl rips off father to live high life?(Mar 28), raises some disturbing questions. For instance, why do teens make such fanciful demands? Is their desire for good living due to loneliness and depression? And why are parents ready to meet such implausible requests, that are designed to spoil their kids? The fact that teenagers are even willing to steal to have some ?fun? must be a cause for concern. Parents need to put their foot down when it comes to children longing for all things material.

 Yours faithfully,

Mahelaka Begum, Calcutta

 Sir ? The pressures of modern life and a blatantly consumerist culture have created a new breed of errant teenagers. The Sarika episode is not the only example of juvenile delinquency that we have heard of late. There have been other instances of teenagers resorting to extreme measures when their demands were not met by their parents. Today?s teens are taking to drinks, drugs and sex very early in life. This is not a na?ve generation that needs to be taught about safe sex or warned against the dangers of drug addiction. They appear to be outwardly confident. But deep down, they are a confused lot. 

 Changes in the family structure have altered the parent-child relationship drastically. In the past, parents intervened in each and every aspect of their children?s lives and were strict disciplinarians. Today, they trust their wards blindly and often buy their affection by showering them with expensive gifts. This has produced a set of spoilt, self-centred kids with expensive tastes. It is a pity that the modern parent refuses to understand that a child needs proper guidance, not pampering. They are also unaware that most kids lead double lives ? bunking school, surfing pornographic sites on the internet, stealing, forging marksheets and often changing into skimpy outfits that they would not dare to wear at home. Instead of sermonizing them, parents would do well to give them a patient hearing, keeping an eye out for what might be withold. A measure of tact, rather than coercion, is likely to see these kids fall in line.

 Yours faithfully,

Anjan Chatterjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is not just social pressure that drives teenagers like Sarika towards leading a lavish life. The real problem is one of upbringing. Teens often start pinching small amounts at first, moving on to larger sums later. Had Sarika?s parents punished her for her first offence, things would have been different today. In cases such as these, it is imperative that the child, as well as the parents, seek the help of a counsellor. 

 Sarika?s father refused to press charges against her and promised to take his daughter to a counsellor. But if he willed that his daughter should get away lightly, what was the use of lodging a complaint in the first place? No amount of counselling would help Sarika unless her parents learn to discipline their errant daughter.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sharmi Adhikary, Calcutta

 Letters to Editor

 A new life for some

 Sir ? The Terri Schiavo affair brought some strange bedfellows to the forefront of this highly symbolic fight. When one saw people like Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, opposing the reinserting of Schiavo?s feeding tube there was really no big surprise. But when one saw Reverend Al Sharpton or Jesse Jackson, two-time presidential candidate of the Democrats, joining ranks with the right, then one realized that the whole affair had taken on a life of its own (pardon the unintended pun). It is hard to say whether Jackson was sincere in getting involved in the Schiavo imbroglio, but the fact that he waited 12 days after Terri?s judicially imposed fast to say something, speaks volumes about his possible motives. Sad that the Pope has passed away, or Jackson could have moved on to Rome to advocate against starving the Pope, who also happened to be on a feeding tube.

 Yours faithfully,

Miguel A. Guanipa, Massachusetts, US

 Flying high

 Sir ? The appeasement policy followed by the United States of America in the subcontinent can be termed as blackmail. On the one hand, the US talks of creating an environment of peaceful co-existence, on the other, it does everything to create an atmosphere of mistrust and suspicion between the neighbours. If the US thinks such double standards will enhance its clout in south Asian politics, it is mistaken. 

 Yours faithfully,

Rashmi Jaiswal, Howrah

 Sir ? The US decision to supply F-16s to Pakistan, while assuaging India with its offers of F-18s, confirms the general impression that the superpower wants to see the arms race alive in the subcontinent (?Sweet nothings?, March 29). One is further frightened by the time gap between the promise made and the promise carried out with respect to the F-18s. Even if F-18s are given to India, the US may supply Hornets to Pakistan under some easy payment terms or as aid. Which means the vicious race will go on.

 Yours faithfully,

K.B. Goswami, Calcutta

 Sir ? If the US has given F-16s to Pakistan, it has presented a bigger opportunity to India by way of sale proposals or collaboration arrangements for state-of-the-art combat aircraft, space programmes and nuclear power generation. The aviation industry can seldom survive by catering to the domestic market. Lockheed Martin, Boeing and our own Hindustan Aeronautics Limited would benefit if there is a joint venture. India must seize the opportunity to upgrade its aviation and defence industry. Efforts should be made to develop indigenous know-how and technologies so that India does not remain a captive arms market. It has been stuck up on the Kaveri engine development for quite some time now. With the opening of our skies, and so many aviation collaborations in the offing, aeronautical engineers in India will be in much demand. Given the limited output of aeronautical engineers from the Indian institutes, the Aeronautical Society of India must brace up to fill the yawing gap.

 Yours faithfully,

Raghubir Singh, Pune

 Sir ? The US sees India as a counterweight to China?s growing influence in Asia. Which means that the US will not do anything to undermine India altogether. Its eagerness to sell India F-18s should be seen in this light. However, the Indian government needs to think carefully before committing itself to any defence purchase from the US, which has proved notoriously unreliable as a supplier of military hardware. There is another point. The US has long been uncomfortable about the proposed Iranian pipeline. The US may hold back the planes for both Pakistan and India, till either of the two nations can be armtwisted into withdrawing from the project. 

 Yours faithfully,

Amit Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? Notwithstanding the F-16s to Pakistan, there has been a significant change in Indo-US ties. Which is why India has been offered 125 planes against 25 for Pakistan, and of far more superior quality. India also has been assured assistance in nuclear power plants. One can argue that this generosity is basically aimed at persuading India to dissociate itself from the Iranian gas pipeline project. Whatever the truth, the availability of the latest nuclear power technology may revolutionize industrial development in the country. 

 Yours faithfully,

Paroma Roy, Calcutta

 Sir ? The US nurtured the taliban to keep a tab on the former Soviet Union, and when it ran out of control, the whole of Afghanistan had to pay the price. Saddam Hussein too had grown big in his boots with American support. If the US has decided to offer both India and Pakistan the proverbial carrot, they should be careful not to bite it. 

 Yours faithfully,

Saket Sundria, Calcutta

 Sir ? The F-16s and F-18s are not humanitarian aid. They are weapons of destruction which will give economic advantage to the US. 

 Yours faithfully,

S.P. Sharma, Mumbai

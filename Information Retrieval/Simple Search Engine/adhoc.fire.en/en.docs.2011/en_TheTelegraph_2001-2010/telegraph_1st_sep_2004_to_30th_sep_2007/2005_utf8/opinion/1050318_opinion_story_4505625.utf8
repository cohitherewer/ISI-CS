 GETTING BETTER

 The visit of the American secretary of state, Ms Condoleezza Rice, to India has gone along predicted lines. As expected, Washington expressed reservations about the proposed Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline because of its concerns about the political regime in Tehran. New Delhi is concerned about the potential American sale of F-16 aircraft to Pakistan. Despite these differences, India?s relationship with Washington is probably on firmer ground today than it has been in many decades. It is unlikely, therefore, that New Delhi and Washington will allow these differing perceptions about Islamabad or Tehran significantly impact on their relationship. It would have been extraordinary if the United States of America had not reacted to India?s growing ties with Iran, especially the proposed pipeline. Washington is convinced that Tehran has nuclear ambitions and is moving towards acquiring nuclear weapons. New Delhi has traditionally had a strong relationship with Iran. Much will depend on events in the next few months and the growing possibility of a confrontation between Tehran and Washington. However, New Delhi can potentially still play the role of a bridge between US and Iran given its strong relationship with both countries. 

 Differences over Pakistan were predictable. Washington clearly believes that it has an ally in Mr Pervez Musharraf and is seeking to strengthen his regime. India is deeply concerned about this arms transfer. The challenge for New Delhi and Washington is not just to develop a relationship independent of Pakistan, but to work together to ensure that Islamabad becomes a force of stability in the region rather then a cause of violence and extremism. The fact remains that India?s relations with the US have grown tremendously in virtually every field in the last few years. Cold War estrangement has changed to engagement of a high order including in the military field, once a taboo. In addition, Washington and Delhi are quietly cooperating on various aspects of national missile defence, sharing information on terrorists and terrorist organizations and slowly developing a common approach to deal with the proliferation of the weapons of mass destruction. 

 Similarly, the ?Next Steps in the Strategic Partnership? between India and the US has generated possibilities about cooperation in three specific areas: civilian nuclear activities, civilian space programmes, and high-technology trade. There is a commitment to ?expanded engagement on nuclear regulatory and safety issues?, ways to cooperate in peaceful uses of space technology, and efforts to create the environment for ?high technology commerce?. Despite many irritants, not all trivial, India?s relationship with the US seems to be more secure than it has been in the last 50 years. There is greater connectivity at the levels of the political leadership and senior officials, and the bandwidth has also greatly expanded.

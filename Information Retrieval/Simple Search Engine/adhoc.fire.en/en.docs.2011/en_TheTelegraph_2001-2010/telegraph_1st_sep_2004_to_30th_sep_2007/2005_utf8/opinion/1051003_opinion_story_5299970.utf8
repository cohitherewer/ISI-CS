 Letters to Editor

 Closed for the day

 Sir ? I wish N.R. Narayana Murthy had stayed back a day to see the real face of Bengal ? the day of the hartal. From the report, ?Infosys likes what it sees? (Sept 29), it seemed his impression of Bengal was too good, too rosy. But I know of another Bengal. I run a small outsourcing firm, with clients in the US, UK, Australia and New Zealand. Fearing the worst, I sent my personal vehicle to pick up the handful of employees who work for me on September 29. Luckily they got to office on time. But there was more to come. The internet got knocked out at around 6 am. This was DataOne and I had no hopes of its getting restored before 10.30 am, when BSNL employees usually trickle into office. Today, no luck ? not even the back-up dial-up connection. No one would answer the phones there, including the mobile numbers. Presumably, the BSNL staff were not able to reach their offices. Things finally got back on track at around 12.30 pm and we were able to download files. 

 When my wife and I went out later in the day, we found that the roads were deserted, there were red banners all over town and in some places, picketeers had used police department road-blocks to stop traffic. Some cadre waving a red flag stopped my car. ?Don?t you know it is a bandh?? they yelled. We tried convincing them that we were doctors and were visiting my sick mother who lived in another part of town when someone in the crowd asked us for proof that we were doctors. It took a lot of persuation before they agreed to let us go. 

 I am just worried what our clients will say when we tell them that we could not complete the work today because we got delayed by a strike. And how many times more do I have to say the same thing in the days to come?

 Yours faithfully,

John J. Sinha, Siliguri

 Sir ? Instead of calling them bandhs, we should call them Jyoti Basu?s birthdays. We will thus be allowed to celebrate four to five birthdays for Basu in Bengal without coming into conflict with the courts who have banned strikes and bandhs. Did I hear Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee say that the industrial climate in Bengal had improved? No, I must have heard him wrong or he must have said it as a joke. But he should not make such expensive jokes; some poor industrialist may take him at his word and start an industry in Bengal. Then where would he be? I pity Bengal. The more things change, the more they remain the same. And the opposition is even worse. Whom do we chose? The devil or the sea?

 Yours faithfully,

R.S. Sharma, Calcutta

 Sir ? I and a few colleagues from Wipro BPO Solutions were travelling to work on bandh day, when our car was stopped, the driver pulled out, the sticker on the car torn out by a mob of around 80-100 people asking why we had dared to come out of the house and we were told to quietly sit in the car. When all this was happening, the police was standing by as mute spectators. We stopped a passing patrol van filled with policemen and demanded that our car be allowed to go. But these men in uniform too did nothing even as the mob kept shouting that they wouldn?t let us go. Finally we were allowed to go.

 Work in our office goes on 24/7. We do not understand the logic of calling bandhs to put across a point of view and much less do we support any restriction on freedom of movement. Incidents on the bandh day confirm the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government?s utter failure to ensure the safety of its citizens, especially women. We too feel very strongly about the way we were treated by CPI(M) cadre, but we would not call a bandh to register our protest.

 Yours faithfully,

Pallavi Srivastava, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Instead of inconveniencing citizens with a strike to protest against the economic and labour policies of the UPA government, why can?t the left simply threaten to withdraw its support? Are such periodic strikes a ploy to reassure themselves that they still have some leftist leanings left in spite of enjoying the fruits of power, or is it election time again?

 Yours faithfully,

Raghubir Singh, Pune

 Sir ? With the strike on September 29, the half-yearly bank closing on September 30, banking operations throughout the country have been crippled for four days at a stretch, since October 1, a Saturday, is a half-day and October 2, a Sunday. Governments should take pre-emptive action against strikes by holding dialogues or conciliatory proceedings.

 Yours faithfully,

R. Sekar, Angul

 Sir ? IIT students had a taste of the bandh when some CITU workers prevented students and professors from entering the institute gates. They supported the bandh, but didn?t know why. When asked, they blabbered some half-understood facts. A professor tried to explain to them the economic loss a bandh entailed and how CITU dogma was delusive and anti-poor. But they didn?t care. Classes were not held but students did not mind since they had a pretty good time goofing about in front of the gates.

 Yours faithfully,

Kaushik Sengupta, Kharagpur

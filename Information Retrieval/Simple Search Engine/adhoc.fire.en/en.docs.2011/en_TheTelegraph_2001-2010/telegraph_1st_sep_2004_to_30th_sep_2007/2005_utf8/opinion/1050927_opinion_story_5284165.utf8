 Letters to Editor

 Action packed

 Sir ? The coach and captain of the Indian cricket team discuss strategy in the dressing room. The discussion gets leaked. Who leaked the discussion? The coach sends an email to the cricket board. The email gets leaked. Who leaked the email? The BCCI AGM gets postponed in the tussle of power among some of the best manipulators in the country, who have zero experience of playing cricket. The citadel of Indian cricket is in a shambles. Is there something in the air? Are all these part of a plan to ruin India?s chances in 2007?

 Yours faithfully,

Sudip Saha, Burnpur

 Sir ? A lot of heat (and no light) has been generated by the recent Sourav Ganguly-Greg Chappell episode. I have the following observations: Ganguly did not divulge the facts of his discussion with Chappell, but answered only when a commentator asked a question. Obviously, the questioner had a fair idea about the dressing room goings-on. The media went after both Ganguly and Chappell but never tried to expose the person who had leaked the information. Who is to be blamed more then ? Ganguly, Chappell, or the person who is behind the curtain and under the protection of the media?

 Yours faithfully,

Manojendra Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? As if poor performances on the field were not enough, the power games within the BCCI and the slanging match between the Indian captain and coach have made the Indian cricket scene more dismal than ever. Where do the cricket-lovers stand in this rigmarole? We give all our love and support, and is this what we deserve in return ? the power games, personal rivalries and pathetic results? 

 Yours faithfully,

Isha Shah, Calcutta

 Sir ? The last few days have seen the worst kinds of indiscretion. Why can?t Indian cricket be managed by cricketers ? and we have no dearth of eminent former cricketers who understand the game better, and can therefore manage it better, than the Dalmiyas and Sharad Pawars. The BCCI has not only become a laughing stock, but its members have brought disrepute to the country. The cricket team is no better. The captain was indiscreet by letting on what happened in the dressing room. The BCCI was even more indiscreet by leaking the confidential email sent by the coach. 

 Hopefully, Ganguly has learnt a lesson from this episode. Chappell must be complimented for not going to the press with his point of view. And he is quite right, India does need to build a young team from now, even if that means that the axe must fall on the ?stars?. Let us have a young team under Mohammed Kaif for the World Cup in 2007, and another young team under V.V.S. Laxman or Hemang Badani for the tests. But let us not give in to the machinations of the lobbyists.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Deenadayalan, Chennai

 Sir ? I don?t want to sound like a parochial Bengali, but I cannot overlook Sourav Ganguly?s contribution to Indian cricket. There is no denying that Ganguly is at fault for bringing out locker-room discussions in the open, for taking the fight to the media to gather public sympathy, but I am not sure how much sympathy he?s getting outside eastern India, if Chappell is correct on his divide-and-rule strategy. But Ganguly took over as captain when Indian cricket was going through its worst phase ever. He brought back the missing aggression and hunger for winning among the boys, and managed to keep the locker-room politics ? at least initially ? at bay. The result was a completely transformed team which marched confidently into the finals of the last World Cup. 

 Sure, Ganguly is going through a bad phase. But one only has to be patient and allow him to regain his form, and his confidence will follow. It is in Indian cricket?s best interest that he continues for a couple more years.

 Yours faithfully,

Arijit De, Mumbai

 Sir ? The appointment of Greg Chappell as the coach of the Indian cricket team was a bad idea from the beginning (?Battle to wear Big Boss cap?, Sept 25). Chappell has never played in India, the reason being his utter contempt for the conditions and arrangements in India. How can the same person be any good for Indian cricket? He has proved once again through his spat with the captain that he does not have any idea about the strengths of Team India and the way it functions. It is not Ganguly, but Chappell who is trying to divide the team to retain his job. He must be sacked immediately.

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir ? After the war of words between the Indian captain and coach, one thing has come out clearly: Greg Chappell is an honest coach who dares to call a spade a spade. Sourav Ganguly has been able to retain his captaincy all this while, thanks to the cricket board politics. Chappell prioritizes the team over individuals. Ganguly would benefit from playing some Ranji cricket now.

 Yours faithfully,

Kumar Rahul, Raipur

 Sir ? Greg Chappell is just doing his job if he says that Sourav Ganguly does not deserve a place in the Indian side. Scoring centuries against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe hardly proves a point. And if history were to be considered for current selection, then we might as well have Gavaskar and Vishwanath playing for India now. While serious thought needs to be given to the best use of youngsters, what we have instead is a boardroom brawl at the BCCI AGM, and a fight between the coach and captain. That?s Indian cricket!

 Yours faithfully,

Rahul Dutt, Calcutta

 RISK FACTOR

 The Reserve Bank of India?s initiative in barring a few banks from making fresh advances to the real estate sector is welcome. The price of commercial real estate in major cities has gone up considerably in the last couple of years, and bank lending to the sector has also increased substantially. Outstanding real estate loans by commercial banks almost doubled in the last fiscal year. The best examples of the runaway rise in prices can be seen from the astronomical rates paid for the sale of NTC mill land in Mumbai, over which a pall of uncertainty now hangs in view of the recent judgment of the Mumbai high court. Simply put, there are signs of a bubble in the housing sector. It will be recalled that a similar bubble had developed in the mid-Nineties in some cities, which was followed by a crash that saw house prices drop sharply. This time around, the difference is that banks are much more exposed to the sector. And while the percentage of non-performing loans for individual houses is still very low, there is no such comfort for loans to builders. The central bank is well aware of the risks involved, which is why it had increased the risk weighting for individual housing loans from 50 per cent to 75 per cent, while the risk weight for banks? exposure to builders and contractors for commercial real estate was increased from 100 per cent to 125 per cent. That means that banks have to put aside more capital while lending to these sectors. However, these measures do not seem to be working, which is why the RBI has had to resort to more direct methods.

 To be sure, it can be argued that the boom in real estate reflects the buoyancy in the economy. Much of the demand for office space comes from the explosive growth in the IT services and BPO industries, which have consumed about 70 per cent of the new stock of office space coming into the market. The mushrooming of shopping malls and multiplexes has also been a potent factor. On the other hand, it is also true that very low interest rates have fuelled borrowing in the real estate and housing sectors. Moreover, foreign capital has now entered the property sector ? a San Francisco hedge fund is a large shareholder of one of the acquirers of Mumbai mill land. Property funds have also made their appearance. In short, this is the right time for the RBI to inject a note of caution into the exuberance in the sector.

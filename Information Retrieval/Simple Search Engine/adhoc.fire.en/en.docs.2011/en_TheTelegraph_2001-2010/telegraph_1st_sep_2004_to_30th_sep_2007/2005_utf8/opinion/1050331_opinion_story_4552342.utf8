 LOOKING BACK ON THE FIRST LOVE

 Gouri Chatterjee

 It was my first job in a newspaper. Not my first job ever so I couldn?t claim the ignorance of a trainee. But it was my first introduction to the inner workings of a newspaper even though I was supposed to be in charge of a number of its pages.

 So there I was, moaning and groaning to the news editor, who in those days was all-powerful in addition to being my boss. I know nothing about page-making and layout and all those finer things that are said to make a paper inviting to readers, I wailed, how will I ever do this job? 

 C.P. Kuruvilla raised his eyebrows and retorted, ?Forget the looks, think of the words. That?s what matters.? And so it did in Business Standard then and continues to do even now when it is celebrating its 30th birthday. 

 It may have turned pink since, but BS is still a paper, one of very few, that gives primacy to content over packaging, that believes news is a serious business meant to inform and enlighten, not just entertain, readers.

 A position it has stuck to even as its rival has notched up huge numbers with headlines like ?Gowda, Gowda kitna dowda? (the then prime minister H.D. Deve Gowda) and a page 1 that looks, on budget and other important days, as if it has been lifted from Amar Chitra Katha comic books.

 Of course I am biased. Not even your first love can ever mean as much as one?s first newspaper. Especially when you felt you were part of one that tried to make a difference. 

 State of belief

 Whatever else one may say about Michael Crichton (that no one can mistake his ?techno-thrillers? as literature, maybe), he has, you have to admit, always taken on powerful enemies. Killer microbes, cloned tyrannosauruses, Japanese with a yen for America, programmed nano-particles, one more ingenious and more ghastly than another.

 And now, the Jurassic Park author has put the media right up there among those who threaten the world. The villain in his new book, State of Fear, is not so much the environment lobby ?misleading? us about global warming as the politico-legal-media complex that has taken control of the world in the last fifteen years through a fear culture. 

 ?Politicians need fears to control the population. Lawyers need dangers to litigate, and make money. The media need scare stories to capture an audience.? So they work in tandem and generate fear, whether about environment or HIV or what have you.

 Always known for his meticulous research, Crichton has found that in the American media, the ?word catastrophe was used five times more often in 1995 than it was in 1985. Its use doubled again by the year 2000. And the stories changed too. There was a heightened emphasis on fear, worry, danger, uncertainty, panic.? 

 Whoever thought you could read a Crichton novel that can even leave you thinking ? and believing? 

 What?s on offer?

 With so many papers opening shop in Mumbai this year, it?s boom time for journalists there. Here are some SMS-es received from that city on Wednesday. ?This has become a crazy city. Hindustan Times is interviewing Times of India guys today. ToI is interviewing BS people. Dainik Bhaskar is calling up all and sundry,? read one. Another says, ?ToI today announced Esops for senior journalists too. They were given ? ranging from Rs 4 lakh to 1 crore ? down to section-head level to ensure senior guys don?t leave.? But not everyone is happy. ?Rumours are swirling like mad,? wrote a friend. ?Everyone here thinks I have quit but no one has made me any offer. What do I do??

 YEAR OF

 THE SMALL-TOWN

 INDIAN

 Many in small towns nationwide are coming to the fore 

 The moment Richa Rajdeva got off the train at Etawah in Uttar Pradesh, she got a culture shock. I saw Internet cafes, even cellular phones, says the 25-year-old software professional, back in Bangalore after her vacation. Considered commonplace in her cosmopolitan environment, these things were alien to her native town even a year ago. But the folks, she says, seem to have taken to them like fish to water. The networks are still a bit weak, but there is an urge to stay connected, she observes. 

 Change doesnt come naturally in the heart of Indias cow-belt but its sweeping through it and small towns nationwide. The small-town Indian used to be oblivious to the world, preferring instead to confine his horizon to his immediate environment. Thats not quite the case anymore, thanks to cable television. Today, hes college educated and a wee bit less caste conscious. For him, smoking bidis is infra dig; cigarettes are not. And while he still cant afford to buy a swank motorbike, hes likely to own at least a basic two-wheeler, apart from a refrigerator, an airconditioner and a television set. 

 The small-town Indian came into his own in 2005. Several hit the headlines too. Consider the following events of 2005. Shahzad Kalim, a fashion designer from Patna, gave other designers a run for their money and landed himself a deal with Italian apparel giant Versace. Bunty Aur Babli, a film with protagonists hailing from obscure places such as Fursatganj and Pankinagar, took the box office by storm. 

 Being a Nagpur boy, I had to spend 10 years in Mumbai trying to get a break, says stand-up comedian Sunil Pal, who became a household name thanks to the Great Indian Laughter Challenge on Star One. But last year, while I auditioned from Mumbai, there were others who auditioned from Nagpur itself. Agrees Ruprekha Banerjee, who won Sony Entertainment Televisions Fame Gurukul contest with Kashmir boy Qazi Tauqeer: Maybe I belong to a lucky generation, where I could dream of becoming a playback singer despite coming from a suburb, says the 21-year-old from Agarpara, on the outskirts of Calcutta. While competing in the contest last year, I never felt that a city person had an edge over me in any way, she says. 

 Indeed, the revolution underway in small-town India in 2005 is reflected in low-cost airlines branching off from trunk routes to small towns ? of the existing 140 Air Deccan flights that connect small-town India, as many as 75 were added in 2005. The pace of connecting small towns will only gain momentum in 2006. While airlines such as Paramount Airways have begun to connect small towns on a regional basis, Air Deccan plans to increase its operations in the coming year. Places such as Trichy, Tuticorin, Jamnagar, Rajkot, Aurangabad and Kandla are slated to be added to our existing network, says an Air Deccan official. About 31 per cent of the companys revenue is generated beyond trunk routes. 

 Telecom operators too have been taking their services beyond cities, and the eons-old rural-urban divide is suddenly being bridged. 

 Also look at whats happening in the BPO industry. Over the past year, the number of people coming into the industry from small towns has shot up considerably, says National Association of Software and Services Companies chief Kiran Karnik. With cities having limited human resources, its the towns which have now become the major suppliers of manpower to the sector. And more often than not, small-towners tend to do much better work than city folk, he adds. 

 Investment in small towns, in industries such as tourism, is on the rise. A golf tourism project is underway in the Buddhist belt of eastern India, spanning places such as Bodh Gaya and Nalanda, to attract Japanese and Korean golfers to that part of the country, says Brandon DSouza, president of Tiger Sports Marketing, which promotes golf. 

 The media and entertainment industries too are cocking an eye at the smaller towns. Many businessmen who want to set up new FM channels are planning to do so outside the metropolitan cities. And television is taking note of small town Indias importance as well. We want Indian Idol 2 to cut across segments, says Tarun Katiyal, vice-president, programming, Sony Entertainment Television. The new idol may well hail from a small town and the channel cant afford to take a risk. Katiyal reckons a 40 per cent jump in television rating points, one measure of viewership, for the channel in small towns and non-metropolitan cities. 

 All these are the outcome of smaller towns having got connected in a better way with urban India and of companies foraying more seriously into the rural market. The market in small-town and rural India was always there, but it was tapped only very recently, notes Bibek Debroy, secretary general of the New Delhi-based PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry. And much of it happened due to the increase in connectivity between the two Indias. The National Highways Development Project had a part to play here, among other things, Debroy adds. 

 Many of the changes that began in 2005 will spill over into 2006. Thats why 23-year-old Parineeth Rau of Mangalore has decided to study chartered accountancy. Our town is about to get a special economic zone in 2006, and more companies will start taking interest in the infrastructural development of the town, he says. 

 Stock brokers and stock market-related agencies such as Apollo Sindoori and Karvy have already set up offices in Mangalore and Rau knows a boom is in the offing. 

 And, who knows, Rau may even roar down the road on a swank, new motorbike.

 RIGHT TO ASK

 What is the role of secrecy in modern statecraft? And to what extent is the right to information central to the functioning of a democracy? These questions have been at the heart of the long debate over the right to information bill, which has at last been passed, with important amendments, by the government. The nominal changes are important here. The Official Secrets Act, 1923, became the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, which, in turn, has been renamed the Right to Information Act. The movement from a feudal and colonial notion of necessary secrecy to the notion of a democratic right is essential to the nature of this legislation. It is, therefore, important to consider the significant amendments to the draft bill that was introduced in the last session of parliament and was examined by a parliamentary standing committee under the supervision of the national advisory council.

 First, the bill does oblige agencies to disclose information suo motu, and there is a system of penalties if there is delay in providing information. Further, erring officials would be subjected to departmental proceedings. Second, the right to information has also been more radically democratized, by exempting applicants below the poverty line from the charges. Third, exemption from this law granted to security and intelligence agencies is not without its exceptions. There are provisions for a ?public benefit test? that might deem disclosure less damaging than secrecy. Also, these exemptions may be vetoed if the reason for information sought involves allegations of corruption or human rights violations. Fourth, there is a more or less independent system of implementation through commissions set up at the state and Central levels. Yet, as with any legislation, the concept of the citizen?s right to know is also a matter of attitude, a democratic mindset that has to be put into practice by politicians and bureaucrats as well as ordinary citizens. That every Indian is entitled to bringing certain standards of transparency and accountability to the various forms of governance that determine his social and political existence is a notion that does not come naturally to most. By endorsing this prerogative as a ?right? ? and not a favour bestowed by the state ? this law, if taken seriously, would be a step towards resolving the conflict between the state and the citizen ? and in favour of the citizen.

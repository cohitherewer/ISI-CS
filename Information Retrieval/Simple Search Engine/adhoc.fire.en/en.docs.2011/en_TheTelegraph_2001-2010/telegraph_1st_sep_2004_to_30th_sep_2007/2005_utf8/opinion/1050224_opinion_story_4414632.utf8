 THE REAL GONZO IS TOUGH

 GOURI CHATTERJEE

 There are many sins the hard-drinking, drug-overdosing, gun-loving, incorrigibly, often violently, behaved Hunter S. Thompson, who killed himself last Sunday, must be accounting for up there. But the biggest crime of this exceptionally gifted American journalist may pass completely unnoticed, unless the gods are reading Indian papers these days. 

 ?I got off the plane around midnight and no one spoke as I crossed the dark runway to the terminal.? That is how Thompson began his 1970 article ?The Kentucky Derby is Decadent and Depraved? ? and changed journalism forever. 

 For the first time, the journalist became not just a passive observer but ?a participant in the scene?, not just a chronicler but a character in the story. It was a ?real Gonzo?, read one of the many congratulatory messages and ?gonzo journalism? was born. 

 Objective journalism of course was always a load of rubbish. Everyone knows there is no such thing but everyone goes along because it cons readers into believing they are getting the real thing.

 But Thompson showed how a story becomes truer when the reporter honestly records his own idiosyncrasies and admits that those foibles act as a prism between real life and the page. Thompson?s revolution soon had bright young things in America and then Britain strutting about in their stories. In India, as always, we got a marked-down version. 

 Instead of ?gonzos? we got I-specialists. How many times have we read, ?The last time I saw the prime minister?? or ?The first time I interviewed Amitabh Bachchan?? or ?The only time I met George Harrison?? and wanted to scream, SO WHAT? So little difference do these words make to the sense of the story. 

 Thompson had a very good reason to put himself in the midst of his story. The respectable, detached, objective tone of mainstream American journalism was, he thought, a powerful ingredient in the banality and dishonesty of American life. He was angry with the America he saw ? he said his ?beat? was the death of the American dream ? and charted new ways to say so.

 Above all, Thompson was never the hero of his stories. Rather, he usually cast himself as a frantic loser, inept and half-psychotic. ?For a confused instant I thought that Ralph [his sketch artist] had brought somebody with him ? a model for that one special face we?d been looking for. There he was, by God ? a puffy, drink-ravaged, disease-ridden creature? It was the face we?d been looking for ? and it was, of course, my own. Horrible, horrible?? The Derby ends.

 Catch any of our self-important scribblers saying any such thing about themselves. And why should they? Hunter believed the powerful had failed his country. Our boys don?t. So they are happy to show off their closeness to the rich and famous.

 Yet nothing stirs

 Indian journalists have other concerns. Fumes are rising from the Press Club of India in Delhi and something may give soon. 

 The press clubs really say a lot about a city and its people: the Calcutta one is full of ageing tipplers, Bangalore is all green and serene. Mumbai is all business-like and Chandigarh is totally entrepreneurial ? there is a swimming pool, a weekly housie and a whole host of things that make life easy for journalists. 

 The Delhi club, true to its location, is a fractious, seedy joint (there was a murder there once and none of the journalists who were witnesses went to court!) with tentwallahs and halwais as alleged members. But now the club is truly seeing red ? it has been spending more money than it has been earning. So passions are running and accusations are flying but journalism, it can be said with some certainty, will be left icy cold.

 Letters to Editor

 Part and parcel

 Sir ? The petition filed in the apex court seeking a ban on ?Islamic courts? speaks volumes about the ignorance of the way Islamic law works (?Legal glare on parallel court?, Aug 17). The petitioner claims that Muslims have set up a ?parallel judicial? system and pleads for the dissolution of shariat courts in the country. The All India Muslim Personal Law Board is accused of being an open affront to the Constitution. In other words, the petitioner has pleaded for the abolition of the religious freedoms enjoyed by the Muslim community. Isn?t this a violation of the fundamental rights of a community?

 Shariat courts are councils for arbitration and have no real or claimed judicial powers. Hence they cannot be termed a ?parallel? judicial system by any stretch of the imagination. Their verdicts are nothing more than recommendations or advice. It is entirely upto the parties to accept or reject the verdict. The Muslim community, however, continues to encourage such reconciliation councils and committees so that people can get free and speedy justice. Such councils take the burden off normal courts where millions of cases are pending. Lok adalats, panchayats and various arbitration and adjudication councils are playing this very role for the benefit of the ordinary people. Only the AIMPLB and Imarat-e Shariyah in Bihar and Orissa have a few dozens of such shariat courts in some cities and towns. Other darul qazas are local bodies established by people in various towns and villages. In any case, they deal only with personal law issues, that is marriage, divorce and inheritance and so on in which both parties are Muslim.

 The current petition is like the one which once pleaded for the ban on the Quran. It was thrown out with the contempt it deserved. The fate of the current petition should not be different. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Zafarul-Islam Khan, New Delhi

 Sir ? Some Muslim social reformers, outfits and Muslim intellectuals with little knowledge of Islam now question and condemn shariat courts? decisions pertaining to marriage, divorce and inheritance. Unfortunately, the media have been projecting them as the true exponents of Islam. In their zeal to denounce the courts, the media have forgotten that shariat courts have been functioning in Bihar for more than eight decades.

 It will not be out of place to remind ourselves here of the unity conference held in Allahabad in 1932, when no Hindu leader had raised any objection to the Muslim proposal for setting up sharia or qazi courts. Madan Mohan Malviya, who cannot be accused of appeasing the Muslim community, was a moving force behind this conference. The Muslim demand for the setting up of such courts was referred to a sub-committee convened by K.N. Katju, who later became the defence minister of independent India and chief minister of Madhya Pradesh. The conference eventually accepted the Muslim proposal. The Congress, at its annual session in Karachi in 1931, had assured the minorities that they would be free to follow their personal laws, and the Indian Constitution later conferred this as a fundamental right of the minorities. Why the hue and cry over the shariat and qazi courts then?

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The government has piously expressed its allegiance to the constitutionally established judicial system but it actually has no intention to interfere into the parallel judicial system that exists among the Muslims. Everything involving Muslims is regarded as an ?internal? matter of the community. Since independence, our politicians have led members of this community to believe that though the legislature has the power to make or amend any law, Muslims have the privilege of accepting or rejecting the decision as also the exclusive privilege to set rules for themselves. Yet, on the day India became independent, Muslims in India must have been mentally prepared for the fact that in secular India the law of the land would be common and universally applicable. 

 Muslims have become so accustomed to the segregation that they now not only expect a separate set of laws, made by their religious leaders and based on their religion, but they have gradually set up a separate judicial system for the community. And our political class has allowed it to happen for the sake of vote-bank politics. So whether the apex court likes it or not, a parallel judicial system exists and will continue to exist in India. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The Darul Uloom of Deoband has been accused of breaking up Imrana Bibi?s marriage. However, no Islamic institution or individual ruled that Imrana should treat her husband like her son. What the Deoband ulemas stated was that during the trial, Imrana could not have sexual relations with her husband, though the marriage was still valid. The marriage would become invalid if her father-in-law was convicted of raping her. This itself was a highly questionable verdict and was not accepted by other Islamic juristic schools. In fact, the two ulemas who issued the fatwa were reportedly reprimanded by the higher authorities in Deoband.

 Another myth that has gained ground is that the ulemas allowed Imrana?s father-in-law to go scotfree. This again is untrue. All ulemas, including those of Deoband, advocated the severest punishment for him if proved guilty. However, they did not dwell on the nature of the punishment because this was an issue for the criminal courts to decide on. It was disheartening to see various social commentators prematurely describe Imrana?s father-in-law as a rapist without waiting for the court verdict. 

 Muslims from every school of thought and political inclination do not support a parallel judiciary for the community. In fact, there is no such parallel judiciary. However, on issues of personal law and religion, Muslims often consult the local qazi or mufti. Sometimes, on matters of property disputes, their opinions are sought. Dispute settlements based on consultations with the qazi or mufti are in the nature of arbitration and they can be termed as out-of-court settlements. In any case, matters of crime are not referred to qazis. 

 Yours faithfully,

Abu Mounir, Siliguri

 TWO FOR JOY

 An encouraging moment can sometimes expose the truly discouraging. The enthusiasm with which the world seems to have greeted the election of two women together with 10 men to Jeddah?s Chamber of Commerce and Industry indicates that for Saudi Arabia, this is a historic event. Women were not allowed to either run or vote in the municipal elections even in early 2005. During the actual voting for the business group in Jeddah, men and women voted on different days, so that segregation could be maintained. The victory is a triumph of women?s ability and a demonstration of men?s acknowledgment of it. But the fact that this has to be recognized and noted at all is a disturbing reminder of the position of women in Saudi Arabia. Jeddah might be a portent, but it is still considered a more liberal region than most of the rest of the country. At the end of the day, Saudi Arabia is still a country where women cover themselves outside the home, are not allowed to drive, must take men?s permission before going out and cannot mix with men from outside the family. 

 The rhetoric generated by this victory is that of reform. It is backed by King Abdullah, who wishes to put the promotion of women at the top of society?s priorities for the sake of economic development. Women could not have run or voted for the election in Jeddah without his permission. But the king has also said that the promotion he wishes to see has to be in line with Islamic principles. The feeling of the women who contested in Jeddah ? there were 17 among 71 candidates ? that this is a small beginning but also an important achievement must be understood in this context. Royalty and religious law are a difficult combination to deal with, and incremental change is welcome. The real issue is not reform, although the rhetoric of reform is significant. The women who ran for the place on the board could do so only because they had the requisite education and the ability. The discrepancy between social realities and intellectual and academic inputs that this implies makes the issue of gender status an extremely complicated one. There is no escape from questions regarding levels of internalization, acceptance, expediency and wisdom. The victory is important, but to see it as a breakthrough many more changes will have to take place.

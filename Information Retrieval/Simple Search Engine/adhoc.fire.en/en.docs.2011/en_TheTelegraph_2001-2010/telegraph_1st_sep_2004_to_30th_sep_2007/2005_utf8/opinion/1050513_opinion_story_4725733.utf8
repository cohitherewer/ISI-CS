 MURDER MOST FOUL

 Want to play?

 By P.J. Tracy, 

 Michael Joseph, ? 6.99

 Thrillers have fascinated readers of all ages. Professional writers, including serious novelists like Graham Greene, have tried their hand at writing thrillers. While some writers have gone on to become masters in their craft, others have failed to attain the same kind of fame. P.J. Tracy?s novel, unfortunately, is not the ideal way to initiate the lay reader into the world of thrillers though.

 Tracy has ventured into a difficult territory in her book. It begins with a murder of an old couple in a church in Kingsford county, Wisconsin. Even as the Sheriff tries to solve the crime, another murder is committed in Minneapolis, the first of a series of murders that shakes the big city. Each one of them is related to a series of games being put up on the internet by a local software company called Monkeewrench which is run by a woman called Grace Macbride and her four colleagues, Annie, Roadrunner, Harley and Mitch Cross. 

 The murders, which are copied from the game show, and take place in the most unlikeliest of places like a cemetery ? a ship and even a shopping mall ? set detectives Magozzi and Gino in search of the elusive killer. The detectives initially suspect that the Monkeewrench partners are involved in the crimes. However, they soon stumble upon clues that make them believe that the murder in Wisconsin and the ones in Minneapolis have been committed by the same man. 

 The book suffers from some serious limitations. For instance, there are so many murders that the plot gets a little confusing. Tracy also uses the choicest of expletives rather profusely. Even the Sheriff is seen mouthing obscenities. But one must admit that it is this aspect that gives the the novel a distinct flavour. 

 The characters in Tracy?s novel remain sketchy and none of them are capable of engaging the reader?s attention. The dialogue, on most occasions, is equally pedestrian, which clearly shows that Tracy is a rookie when it comes to thrillers. What keeps the reader interested is Tracy?s acumen in fleshing out an interesting plot. 

 As one continues plodding through the book, one may fret about its lack of originality. But, quite intriguingly, it is still difficult to put the book down. This can be explained by the fact that the reader is won over by Tracy?s engaging style of story-telling. In fact, in the end, which comes sooner than expected, the reader is left asking for more. 

 It is unlikely that this book will create a storm in the literary world. But one can say that the novel will have its own circle of admirers who would look forward to the release of Tracy?s next book.

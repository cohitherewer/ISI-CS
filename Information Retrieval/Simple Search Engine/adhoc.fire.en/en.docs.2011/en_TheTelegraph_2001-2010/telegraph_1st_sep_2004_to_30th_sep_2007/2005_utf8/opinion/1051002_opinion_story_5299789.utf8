 Letters to Editor

 Flying on clipped wings

 Sir ? Could anything have been more bizarre? A strike called by airport employees all over India against the Centre?s proposed privatization of the Mumbai and Delhi airports, brought things to a standstill, not in Delhi or Mumbai ? or anywhere else ? but in Calcutta. Even our comrades in Thiruvananthapuram let air-traffic flow normally. Should we still crib if foreign airlines pass Calcutta by and fly from non-metro cities like Ahmedabad? One must sow as one reaps.

 Yours faithfully,

 Shekhar Basu, Calcutta

 Film over the eyes

 Sir ? Paheli deserves to go to the Oscars. Shah Rukh Khan must be lauded not merely as the hero of the film, but also as its producer, because he agreed to produce the non-commercial film. As expected, the film did not get much commercial success, but that has been compensated by praise from within the film fraternity as well as from critics. I hope Paheli marks the end of India?s long wait for the Oscar. 

 Yours faithfully,

Md. Mudassir Alam, New Delhi

 Sir ? By nominating Paheli as India?s entry for the 2006 Oscars, the panel of selectors has destroyed what could have been India?s best chance to win the Oscars. Black had all the qualities that the Oscar judges look for in the foreign film category. By what cinematic yardstick is Paheli a better film than Black? Black could have won an Oscar for India, but then, little can be expected from people who selected Jeans as India?s entry some years ago.

 Yours faithfully,

Tausique Ahmed, Calcutta

 Sir ? Paheli may not have been a commercial success, but its original script, excellent direction and brilliant cinematography give it an advantage over its closest competitors. Black, despite all its technical brilliance, failed to shake off the artificialness about it. One hopes that Amol Palekar will get his due for making a truly fine film and utilising the great treasure trove of Indian folk tales, neglected so far by mainstream Indian cinema.

 Yours faithfully,

Harsh Mathur, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is a bit bewildering to find that Amol Palekar?s Paheli has been nominated as India?s entry for the Oscars, especially when there were exceptional films like Black and Iqbal in the running. Paheli does have some superlative acting and good costumes, and it bears the stamp of a master director. But the storyline is weak and the fairy-tale script are unlikely to impress the Oscar jury. Black, on the other hand, with its stellar performances, would have stood a better chance with the Academy Awards jury. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Commercial break

 Sir ? The sharp decline in advertising standards is, as S.L. Rao suggests, primarily because of an indiscriminate competition among advertisers and owing to the fast-spreading concept of high consumerism in the era of globalization (?Advertising that works?, Sept 26). That is why advertisements today are totally unconvincing and mired in technical inaccuracies. Multinational companies like Pepsi and Coca-Cola encourage the creation of a make-believe world. This can only send misleading signals to the consumers.

 Yours faithfully,

Tanmoy Bhattacharjee, Howrah

 Sir ? Must S.L. Rao use his fortnightly column to parade his erudition and to list his achievements in the Indian industry? Till recently, we thought he was an economist. Now we find that he is an advertising guru as well.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Gupta, Calcutta

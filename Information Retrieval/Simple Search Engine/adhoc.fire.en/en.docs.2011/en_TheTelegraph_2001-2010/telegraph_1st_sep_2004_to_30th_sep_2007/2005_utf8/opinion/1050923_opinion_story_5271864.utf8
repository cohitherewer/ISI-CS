 UNQUIET FLOWS

 Neighbours are not necessarily friends. Instead, they are more likely to behave as rivals, if not enemies, when it comes to sharing natural resources. It is not surprising, therefore, that India and Bangladesh have old disputes over the sharing of river waters. The strains in relations between the two countries made the disputes even more intractable in recent years. Nobody expected Mr Priya Ranjan Das Munshi?s visit to Dhaka to resolve all the disputes. But its major gain was the resumption of talks. As the lower riparian nation, Bangladesh can have genuine concerns over India?s river management schemes. That was why India?s river-linking project, announced by Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee?s government, became a major irritant for Bangladesh. Mr Das Munshi, the Union minister for water resources, did well to allay Dhaka?s fears on this count. This was in keeping with the joint statement, issued after the meeting of the foreign secretaries of the two countries in June, that India would not take any ?unilateral action? on the project that might harm Bangladesh?s interest. 

 However, Dhaka needs to delink the issue of river waters from its domestic politics. Be it the rivers, trade or transit, all issues relating to India get enmeshed in Bangladesh?s internal politics. The agreement on the sharing of the Ganga waters is an example. The government of Ms Khaleda Zia condemns it as a sell-out to India primarily because the agreement was signed by the previous government headed by her rival, Sheikh Hasina Wajed. Some of Dhaka?s anxieties would have seemed justified but for the political overtones they are given. Bangladesh?s water resources minister, Mr Hafizuddin Ahmad, did just that by threatening to take the dispute over the Ganga waters to the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation during its meeting next month. There is little doubt that India would oppose any such move. The SAARC is a regional forum and its charter bars the member-countries from using it for bilateral issues. It will not help Dhaka to try and get over the restriction by making Nepal a party to the dispute. The ploy can only complicate matters further. Instead of trying to rally other countries? support, Dhaka should look at more realistic ways to engage New Delhi.

 Letters to Editor

 Equal beings

 Sir ? The apprehensions of Y.K. Sabharwal, the new chief justice of India, about the proposed bill to set up a national judicial commission is rather discomfiting, coming at the beginning of his tenure (?Lok Pal bill set for deep freeze?, Nov 1). If the chief justice demands that he be insulated from scrutiny, the prime minister and the president, as also the legislators, can make the same demand. Since the Constitution lays down that each citizen is equal before the law, can, and should, there be exceptions made? Sabharwal?s contention that the chief justice cannot be tried by his juniors suggests that the individual is seen to be more powerful than justice itself. This raises serious questions about the foundations of the judiciary, particularly at the lower level. The argument also negates the concept of transparency and accountability in a democracy. It is not surprising that the former chief justice of India, R.C. Lahoti, is of the same opinion as Sabharwal. For long, judges have come to consider themselves a class apart from other public servants. 

 Yours faithfully

Sushant, Calcutta

 Sir ? The bill seeking to make judges accountable for their actions will not have any effect unless the national judicial commission includes members of other professions. The commission is supposed to consist of the chief justice himself and three seniormost judges of the Supreme Court, the predecessor to the office of the chief justice, three chief justices of the high courts in order of seniority, representatives of the Union law ministry, the attorney-general, and an outstanding law academic. How can one expect members of the commission, all drawn from the same field, turning against the fraternity and hold a member culpable?

 In the past, only one Supreme Court judge has been impeached. But there have been allegations against several other judges who have not been tried. If the government is serious about accountability in the high offices of the democracy, then the composition of the national judicial commission should be democratized. And perhaps even the judiciary itself. The government should enact an independent body, like the Union Public Service Commission, for the recruitment of judicial officers for the districts as well as the states.

 Yours faithfully,

N. Ramchandran, Durgapur

 Sir ? The national judicial commission is supposed to look into complaints of corruption, favouritism, nepotism and so on in the judiciary. The Union law and justice minister, H.R. Bharadwaj, had made it clear that the commission will be a totally autonomous body, and hold inquiries into allegations whenever and wherever necessary. The proposal has, quite obviously, met with severe opposition from within the judiciary. 

 We may recall that recent Supreme Court judgments ? the quashing of the controversial Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunals) Act, its strictures on the reservation of seats in private unaided colleges, and more recently, adverse criticism of the government in the Bihar assembly dissolution case ? has often brought the government in direct conflict with the judges. Have these face-offs in any way influenced the government?s attempt to push the bill through parliament? 

 Yours faithfully,

Suman Barthakur, Guwahati

 Sir ? The former chief justice of India, R.C. Lahoti, is justified in advocating the increase in the retirement age of high court judges to 65 years, to be on a par with that of Supreme Court judges. This might check the hectic lobbying among high court judges for an elevation to the apex court in order to get an extension. The present system of rehabilitating retired judges in post-retirement designations in various commissions of inquiry should be stopped to ensure an unbiased investigation. 

 Yours faithfully,

G.B. Srikantiah, Bangalore 

 Lack of commitment

 Sir ? It is appalling that doctors in a state hospital, and that too in a city like Calcutta, can refuse to treat an AIDs patient (?Hospital shuns HIV patient?, Nov 9). One shivers to think what the situation is in rural hospitals and nursing homes.The reaction of the doctors at the emergency ward of the Calcutta Medical College Hospital underscores the level of ignorance that prevails in the medical fraternity in matters concerning the disease. If doctors behave like this, it is futile to blame the public for their hostility towards this disease. India currently has the second largest population of HIV patients, but may soon overtake Africa. If Indian doctors are not forced to update their medical knowledge by then through a mandatory ?continued medical education?, incidents like the one at Calcutta Medical College will recur. AIDS patients need our help, not our wrath. This can happen only if medical experts receive proper knowledge about HIV, and in turn, increase general awareness about the disease.

 Yours faithfully,

Kunal Saha, Columbus, US

 Sir ? The declaration of commitment on HIV/AIDS in 2001, marked a milestone in the battle against AIDS. It laid down work for the international community ? holding prevention campaigns, building medical infrastructure, providing necessary resources, ensuring treatment, care and respect for people living with HIV. In keeping with these aims, an awareness camp will be organized at Elgin Road- Chowringhee crossing in Calcutta on December 1. Let us all support the noble cause.

 Yours faithfully,

Manjit Dada, Calcutta

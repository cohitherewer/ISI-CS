 TOO MANY TO BLAME 

 Malvika Singh

 These are strange times across the world. The United States presidency is spending an obscene amount of money on the ?anointing? of Mr Bush. Juxtaposed to that is another obscenity, that of US soldiers smiling gleefully after sexually assaulting prisoners of war. It speaks volumes about the value system of that country, its arrogant attitude towards other cultures and what it sees as right and wrong. It is a spoilt nation, like a rich spoilt brat, that needs to come of age, absorb other philosophies, comprehend other faiths and cultures, experience the ancient and new worlds in an attempt to mature into a rooted, secure society.

 We, in our part of the world, have dealt with the recent tsunami disaster. We have assisted our neighbours. What would the US do if a tsunami hit the east coast and invaded New York? Who would they invade in retaliation? Their interventions, be it in Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq, wherever, have been selfish and for their own parochial reasons. They are a rich but adolescent nation with many warts.

 Here we continue to fiddle about with the case of the chief of the Kanchi math instead of bringing it to a conclusion. Our judicial system is adept at endless delays, aggravating situations that invariably lead to social traumas. The Zahira Sheikh case is clear to one and all. Both cases have hogged the headlines for weeks and their ?story? has ceased to be of any interest to most. We have another cartoon playing: the election commissioner saying that Laloo Prasad Yadav should not use the Banerjee Commission findings on Godhra in his campaign. Why should this public document not be used? Transparency of information and its dissemination are essential in any democracy. It is not bribery. It is not corruption.

 Beyond rights

 Should no social issue, like the killing of the Sikhs in Delhi, be discussed in the public domain? Should rape by policemen and uniformed men be taboo in a campaign? Should murders, killings, extortion, corruption be left unspoken? Are they trying to curb the freedom of thought and expression? Are they attempting to redefine the meaning of democracy? Who are they to say that only development and roti, kapda and makan can be discussed from political platforms and rostrums. Where were they when slander campaigns were carried out against leaders of the last opposition? To be seen to be ?partisan? will be corrosive and to curb the dissemination of information would be a breach of democratic norm. Therefore, the EC must stay away from such diktats. It must not step out of its lakshman rekha. It will find its credibility reduced if it intrudes into a space it has no jurisdiction over.

 Overreaction, over-enthusiasm, overkill ? it is unnecessary. What is desperately required is a holistic comprehension of all the institutions that create and establish social norms, including the functioning of this unusual democracy. Analysis is imperative and adjustments are also needed. Therefore, shooting from the hip is dangerous and personal positions are unacceptable. Everything, except for personal attacks, should be in the public domain. Our people have a right to know what is happening across their country. For the election commissioner to pass judgment on whether a public document can or cannot be used during a campaign is overstepping his brief. 

 We are through eight months of the present government and it is time the prime minister begins to address the reform of government and its downsizing. It is time for him to settle down to doing the basic infrastructural work for better governance. It is time for action. And, because Manmohan Singh is not carrying political baggage, he is the only candidate on the horizon who will be able to pull it off. Having set out the blueprint for economic reforms, it is time for reforms in governance.

 PRESIDENT AND THE PEOPLE

 The position of the president of India is grounded in a profound contradiction. He is the head of state without any substantive powers as the Constitution makes it explicit that ?the President cannot exercise the executive power without the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers?. This makes the office of the president ceremonial, somewhat akin to the position of the monarch in the United Kingdom. The ceremony and the pomp associated with the office of the president put him above the din and bustle of politics and the activities of political parties. Indian democracy, functioning as it does through the cabinet form of governance, is premised on the inactivity of the president. Presidential activism in the sphere of politics is a threat to the cabinet form of government and thus to the democratic body politic. This is what makes the actions of Mr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam regarding the political situation in Jharkhand absolutely unacceptable and politically lethal.

 To say this is not to approve of what the governor of Jharkhand, Mr Syed Sibtey Razi, has done. He has violated all constitutional conventions by inviting Mr Shibu Soren to become the chief minister. It is clear from the numbers that Mr Soren and the formation of which he is a part do not command a clear majority in the Jharkhand legislative assembly. On the contrary, the alliance led by the Bharatiya Janata Party, prima facie at least, has better claims to a majority in the Bidhan Sabha. What the gover-nor has done cannot be condoned. But this does not warrant Mr Kalam?s descent from his lofty position into the hurly-burly of politics. Mr Kalam has summoned the governor and allowed the BJP-led alliance to parade their legislators before him. This has not brought dignity to the highest officeholder of the republic of India. Mr Kalam is entirely justified in being morally anguished by the governor?s defiance of all constitutional propriety, but the president himself should not have allowed his private anguish to be articulated in political action. In no sphere of life do two wrongs make a right.

 The activism displayed by the president is full of good intentions that are propelled by the complete lack of ethics on the part of the political class. But the president is not the moral guardian of politicians. The august office the president occupies demands that he upholds the doctrine of separation of powers laid down in the Constitution. The Constitution endows on the office of the president a certain dignity, which is predicated on the constitutional provision that he will not act personally. Unwittingly, Mr Kalam as the president is setting a bad precedent. He owes it to the people of India who have made him the first citizen of the republic to uphold the dignity of his office. He can do this by not allowing the presidency to be touched by politics.

 FIGURE SKATING

 Violence is a simple matter, just a few figures on a chart. Every police station has them on the wall. And if it is violence against women that is the tiresome subject of discussion once again, the Kolkata Police seize on these figures with confidence. Numbers are their arsenal against unwelcome attacks such as the one recently made by the National Women?s Commission, headed by Ms Poornima Advani. In response to Ms Advani?s comments, that crimes against women had increased in Calcutta between 2001-2002 and 2002-2003, that the increase in rape was alarming, that not even half the promises made to the commission six months ago had been fulfilled by the authorities, and that political intervention in cases of crimes against women was unacceptable, the police just mumbled that the figures on their charts did not match the commission?s.

 The more forgiving would say that this inconsistency is based on a difference in perception ? perhaps the Kolkata Police and the National Women?s Commission do not see eye to eye about what comprises violence against women. They have different ideas about what constitutes rape, perhaps. But rape is very clearly defined by law, although activists do not consider the definition satisfactory. Yet the act as defined is perfectly identifiable. So compassion will not work. But what do figures prove? Ms Advani has cited them to substantiate her argument. For the police, they are a formality, a way of warding off further conversation. Quibbling over the number of crimes is the most fitting expression of the cavalier attitude the police and state have towards violence against women. The government?s deliberate blindness towards trafficking of women has led to an increase there too, as Ms Advani pointed out. Predictably, the state has failed again to take the steps it promised the commission six months ago.

 What is required is investment ? of money, time, manpower, attention. And seriousness of purpose. When the target is prevention of and punishment for crimes against women, neither the state government nor the police can be bothered. Because such investment is ultimately based on respect. It is exactly this that the left-governed state is unable to accord women. The police refuse to take complaints when a woman is the victim of violence. Rapists and other offenders against women are let free because the police do not ? cannot is incredible ? bring adequate evidence before the court. Even in cases where penalties are levied, the cases are so built that the punishment is light. The police reflect the dominant attitude of society. And that is best manifested in the popular courts, panchayats and shalishi meets, where the woman is almost always found guilty and sometimes has the most horrendous punishments inflicted upon her. It is no wonder that the police of the city should feel that citing numbers is good enough defence.

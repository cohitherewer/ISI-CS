 POWER DOUSES THE FIRE

 Gouri Chatterjee

 Power has an amazing capacity to blunt the edges. It muted the BJP?s fiery rhetoric on the temple and the uniform civil code, it has the Bengal CPI(M) rolling out the red carpet for foreign investors, it douses the fire in journalists.

 As a mere journalist-editor, T.N. Ninan kept Business Standard?s advertisement department firmly in place; as shareholder-editor, he allows transgressions that would once have had him foaming at the mouth. When he started Asian Age, M.J. Akbar had dreams of an ad-free page 1; he soon ceased to be a chooser.

 Journalists can talk of principles; owners have bottom lines to think about. (It can be seen differently. Once, many moons ago, I had complained to an owner of a ?corporate policy? that allowed the newspaper to be smothered by ads, leaving little space for news. ?What corporate policy,? came the riposte, ?it?s your salary.?) 

 So, I fear for my most favourite journalist, Rajdeep Sardesai, who left NDTV this week to float a new television company, Broadcast News. ?We will be launching a new channel that will be driven by the journalists,? he is reported to have said. ?The emphasis will be on good journalism and journalistic stories.? 

 Famous last words? I hope not. I so want to believe there is a market for ?good journalism? out there. But I am not holding my breath. NDTV made more money out of the celebrity-driven Night Out than Sardesai?s own Big Fight. 

 Still, if anyone can do it, it is Sardesai. Such is his star value that NDTV?s shares lost 11 points on the Bombay Stock Exchange last Friday when news of his departure became known, while that of TV-18, one of his strategic partners, gained 9 points even as the BSE crashed by 220 points.

 So here?s wishing him the very best of luck. It would be too sad to lose a brilliant journalist and get a run-of-the-mill owner in his place. 

 What do they want?

 It?s always been said of women, but it seems to be true of newspaper readers as well. Even that god among the media, the Times of India, doesn?t quite know the reader?s mind ? and at a time when the mantra is ?give readers what they want.?

 It?s not that long ago that the Times bosses decreed readers didn?t want ?serious? stuff like reviews, axing any page that remotely smacked of ?high culture? ? books, art, etc. The nymphets of the fashion and film industries were let loose ? because ?readers want them?. The dumbing down of the Indian media began.

 Now, suddenly, over the last two Sundays, the Times has reintroduced a book review page and a culture page. Two full ad-free pages devoted to the Ganesh Pynes and Kazuo Ishiguros of this world (as well as Shah Rukh Khan?s reading habits), presumably because that?s ?what readers want?. 

 Reason enough for anyone to doubt whether it is at all possible to know what readers want. But not the media bosses. They won?t give up so easily. They can?t. Their writ runs only because of this mantra.

 Once it is accepted that we have to give readers or viewers what they want, it?s manager raj with their surveys and focus groups, committees and power point presentations. Take that away and the journalists will get back to doing what they think ought to be done, ignoring the managers completely. 

 Still, it?s good to know that what goes down comes up too.

 Stick to print

 There must be many who watch Walk the Talk, but who? Everyone, from Atal Bihari Vajpayee to Vir Sanghvi, seems to have read the explosive Sudarshan interview in the pages of the Indian Express. Maybe Shekhar Gupta could stick to print and find some other outlet for his excess energy.

 Not in the accepted sense of the word 

 Even three decades after the Emergency, 

 India continues to miss its political relevance, just as it 

 did during the crisis, writes N.J. Nanporia

In evil hour

 Thirty years after the event, 

 reactions to the Emergency continue to be shaped by political 

 bias, platitudes like ?murder of democracy? and an overwhelming 

 sense of political correctness. Not long ago, Rahul Gandhi 

 ?admitted? that ?excesses? had occurred, an admission that 

 hardly made sense because no one has denied that people 

 were arrested, that censorship was imposed or that a wide 

 variety of oppressive acts were perpetrated, some under 

 the directions of Sanjay Gandhi. Sonia Gandhi herself is 

 on record saying that she regretted the Emergency, all of 

 which reinforced the view that the 1975 crisis is not something 

 to be understood but to be condemned. The Prasar Bharati?s 

 decision to drop the film on Jayaprakash Narayan hasn?t 

 helped matters either.

 But neither apologies nor admissions 

 can ever provide a key to what the Emergency was about. 

 It can only be found by focussing on the one individual 

 who matters ? Indira Gandhi herself. And also by asking 

 the only question that matters ? what were her motives and 

 what moved her to do what she did? 

 Shortly after the Allahabad judgment 

 in 1975, Indira Gandhi said that she was ?not a politician 

 in the accepted sense of the word?. Though she had her share 

 of egotism, this was not a display of defensive arrogance. 

 Nor was she implying here that she occupied a position of 

 exceptional privilege and that the normal rules of public 

 conduct did not apply to her. It was an unintended and indirect 

 disclosure of a subject that governed her turbulent career 

 since the 1969 split ? her disgust for and absolute rejection 

 of politicking.

 As a member of the Congress working 

 committee in 1955 and later of the central parliamentary 

 board; as president of the Congress in 1959 (when she played 

 a persuasive role in the bifurcation of bilingual Bombay 

 and the dismissal of the communist government in Kerala); 

 as her father?s political hostess; and in 1964, as Lal Bahadur 

 Shastri?s minister of information and broadcasting, Indira 

 Gandhi was exposed to the full blast of politicking. At 

 this point, we have another of her revealing comments, ?The 

 nation is in a hurry and we cannot afford to lose time.? 

 Combine her strong aversion to politicking with her sense 

 of time draining away, and arguably we have the first intimation 

 of the approaching tragedy.

 During this time, the Congress 

 was also running out of the energy that had sustained it 

 as a movement. There was a mismatch, unseen by the party, 

 between the old guard that was firmly in the saddle and 

 the new challenges that confronted it. There was, additionally, 

 a sense of a mission having been accomplished and lost moorings. 

 War with Pakistan and the party?s internal dissent induced 

 organizational paralysis and an inability to redefine itself. 

 These could not have been acceptable to someone of Indira 

 Gandhi?s temperament, though she was, undoubtedly, aware 

 that her own elevation to prime ministership under the auspices 

 of K. Kamaraj was itself a prime example of politicking. 

 Of course the atrophied old guard hadn?t the remotest clue 

 to what Indira Gandhi was about to do. Confined within the 

 stagnating limits of syndicate culture, it was unable to 

 realize that she could read its motivations and calculations 

 like an open book.

 Her conclusions are not difficult 

 to guess. The syndicate culture was incompatible with her 

 idea of national achievement and the urgency of the task. 

 All those associated with the syndicate were victims of 

 a mindset that couldn?t conceive of a politician having 

 any concern other than those held by it. There was a complete 

 lack of comprehension about a prime minister who refused 

 to be a run-of-the-mill politician. The old guard came to 

 regard her as a pliable instrument in its hands.

 On her part, Indira Gandhi realized 

 that she could survive only by mastering the techniques 

 of politicking. She did this with the panache and determination. 

 She beat the syndicate at its own game. Her expulsion from 

 the syndicate marked her out as someone with a bold, uncompromising 

 and dynamic approach to national affairs. 

 Psychologically and symbolically, 

 for her, this was one way of disinheriting the politicking 

 politicians. Yet, tragically, this was the only kind of 

 politicians available, given the system that had bred them. 

 Indira Gandhi also realized that her convictions could not 

 be translated into an understandable public ideology or 

 into terms the Constitution would find acceptable. An appreciation 

 of this persuaded her to repeatedly try and reach out to 

 what she called the ?masses?. With them, she felt a rapport 

 that was impossible to replicate with anyone else in the 

 political jungle. Jayaprakash Narayan spoke of ?total revolution?, 

 signalling a break with the past. For Indira Gandhi, the 

 revolution was primarily in her mind, while for Narayan, 

 it was out there physically, which unfortunately was also 

 a recipe for chaos and indiscipline. In the event, neither 

 could make a headway against factionalism, violence, corruption, 

 the pursuit of power, regionalism and so on. Collectively, 

 these represented ?parliamentary democracy?, but actually, 

 it was the ?greatest demagoguery in the world.? 

 I ndira Gandhi helped popularize 

 the legend of a ruthless person, frequently hiring people 

 and firing them, thus lending credibility to the Janata 

 campaign against the ?personality cult?. Yet, even in her 

 increasing isolation, she kept hoping to find some empathy 

 that would elude her forever. JP too was frustrated and, 

 confronted by the crisis, pushed himself to the limits ? 

 as the romantic idealist is apt to do ? calling out to students 

 to agitate, to the armed forces to revolt, and to civil 

 servants to disobey orders that were not to their liking. 

 The infamous railway strike and 92 derailments followed. 

 Under total revolution, all the ills of the system, all 

 that Indira Gandhi wanted to uproot, came to be magnified.

 Prakash Tandon struck a note of 

 sanity and balance when he said: ?For years we wished an 

 end to chaos and willingly promised to forgo some rights 

 for some order and an end to how a whole town of ten million 

 could be held to ransom by whoever chose to call a strike 

 for whatever cause. A question we should ask is whether 

 Mrs Gandhi was carrying, somehow, unknown to her, the cumulative 

 will of a democratic people looking for a catharsis, long 

 tired of incompetent governments.? Indira Gandhi did what 

 her father could never have done ? critically question a 

 system imposed on India for the sole reason that it was 

 favoured by the departing colonialists.

 As for the Shah commission and 

 the legal trivialities into which it sunk, it should be 

 said that the commission was more keen to pursue Indira 

 Gandhi than on ensuring an inquiry into the origins of the 

 Emergency. So much so that it is pointless to ask whether 

 it was competent to investigate the circumstances or the 

 way in which the Emergency was declared. In the end, Indira 

 Gandhi realized that she had all the right reasons for doing 

 the wrong thing in conditions in which she could never succeed. 

 All she could do was administer what she called ?shock treatment?, 

 which, nevertheless, left the system largely unchanged.

 On the sidelines were those who 

 expediently applauded Indira Gandhi without the slightest 

 understanding of her motives, but became her harshest critics 

 post-Emergency. There were others sincerely associated with 

 her but who remained entirely innocent about what was going 

 on. And then there were the would-be Emergency heroes, so 

 remote from reality and so full of their egotistic concerns 

 that they waited eagerly to be arrested, only to be ignored 

 by an unimpressed Emergency authority. We are indebted to 

 them for injecting some comedy into an otherwise tragic 

 affair. 

 As for Indira Gandhi, she remained 

 the way she had started, a person whose image was writ large 

 on the national and international scene, but whose core 

 remained private and intense. The statement that ?only a 

 political illiterate could disapprove of the Emergency? 

 is well worth pondering over.

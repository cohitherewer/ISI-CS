 THINK OUT OF THE BOX 

 T. Muivah?s suggestion ? a special 

 federal relationship with India ? may well be the solution 

 to the Naga dispute, writes Sanjib Baruah 

 Honest effort 

 When in an interview on BBC?s 

 Hard Talk last month Thuingaleng Muivah spoke of 

 a special federal relationship with India it could have 

 become a sign that the eight-year-old peace process is finally 

 heading towards a settlement. However, it was not interpreted 

 that way. Apparently our opinion-makers do not consider 

 a special federal relationship a viable proposition. Nor 

 can the kind of constitutional change necessary to create 

 such a relationship be won in a bargain at a closed-door 

 negotiation. Public debates have to first prepare the ground.

 In certain ways, the climate for 

 such a debate could not have been more conducive. Today, 

 innovative new ideas are part of the discussion on the status 

 of Kashmir. Consider K. Natwar Singh?s sky-is-the-limit 

 comment on what is possible. There is no reason why the 

 same could not apply to Nagaland. However, whether the kind 

 of national attention that focuses on Kashmir can be mobilized 

 for the Naga question is another matter. When it comes to 

 the North-east, we seem to be quite content to leave decisions 

 to small groups of people: we don?t even want to know very 

 much until some crisis boils over.

 There have been two major stumbling 

 blocks to a settlement of the Naga conflict ? the question 

 of Naga sovereignty and the idea of integration of Naga-inhabited 

 areas. Under the leadership of Muivah and Isak Chishi Swu, 

 the Nagas have begun thinking of the sovereignty question 

 in quite creative ways, outside the traditional paradigm 

 of independence. 

 This has been an act of admirable 

 statesmanship on the part of Muivah and Swu, and the single 

 most important factor that has carried the peace process 

 this far. There is no similar movement on the question of 

 the integration of Naga-inhabited areas, but Muivah has 

 indicated that he only seeks an agreement in principle. 

 He is willing to give more time for translating such a commitment 

 into practice.

 It is in this context that the 

 idea of special federal arrangements could provide a breakthrough. 

 Muivah?s reply to a question on whether such a settlement 

 could be within the framework of the Constitution was suggestive. 

 It can come ?as close as possible? to that, he said, but 

 ruled out a settlement ?within the Indian Union or within 

 the framework of the Indian Constitution?. Yet it is hard 

 to argue that a federal relationship can be anything other 

 than one that is spelt out in the Constitution. Further, 

 Muivah?s reasoning on the issue was not based on principle, 

 but on a concern that an agreement made today might not 

 last, that laws incorporating such an arrangement can be 

 thrown out later.

 One can hardly blame Muivah for 

 reading the Indian track record accurately. After all, that 

 is exactly what happened to the autonomy that Jammu and 

 Kashmir had once enjoyed. Article 370 had made India a leading 

 example of what political scientists call asymmetrical federalism 

 ? a federation where some units have different powers, or 

 greater autonomy than others. In the case of Kashmir, it 

 was done to make its constitutional status consistent with 

 the accession instrument. Thus parliament?s powers were 

 limited to defence, foreign affairs and communication and 

 the residual powers were left to the state assembly. Furthermore, 

 the state?s two top offices had special designations ? Sadr-i-Riyasat, 

 instead of governor, and prime minister, rather than chief 

 minister. But gradually all elements of Kashmir?s special 

 autonomy disappeared, titles like Sadr-i-Riyasat were eliminated 

 and Kashmir became like any other state.

 Today a leading example of asymmetrical 

 federalism is Canada, where Quebec has more powers in certain 

 areas compared to the predominantly Anglophone provinces, 

 and Spain, where ?historical communities? such as Catalonia, 

 Basque Country and Galicia have more powers than other autonomous 

 communities.

 But unlike Canada and Spain, Indian 

 public opinion has been ambivalent about asymmetrical federalism. 

 To a large extent, this attitude was responsible for sealing 

 the fate of Article 370. Article 371, which follows the 

 constitutional provision on Kashmir, grants some asymmetrical 

 autonomy to Nagaland and a few other northeastern states. 

 That this autonomy has survived owes more to the lack of 

 interest in the region in the rest of the country than to 

 any active public support for such a dispensation.

 A special federal relationship 

 can be built on the foundation of the asymmetrical federalism 

 that already exists in Nagaland. Indeed it might even permit 

 the settlement of the integration issue. For instance, a 

 second legislative chamber can be constituted to represent 

 the interests of Nagas living outside Nagaland. Such a chamber 

 elected by non-territorial constituencies ? something like 

 a Naga Ho-ho transformed into a statutory body ? can recognize 

 the trans-state nature of Naga identity and respect the 

 territorial integrity of states like Manipur, Arunachal 

 Pradesh and Assam. But such an idea cannot be explored unless 

 the neighbouring northeastern states are brought into the 

 discussion as stakeholders in the Naga conflict.

 One should not expect a final 

 settlement to take the form of an agreement announced to 

 the press at the end of secret negotiations. What the next 

 stage of the Naga peace process needs most is not fresh 

 ideas but active efforts to link what happens behind closed 

 doors with dialogues outside. Such dialogues should involve 

 not only Naga civil society, but also the civil societies 

 of the neighbouring northeastern states and the rest of 

 the country. The Naga leadership and the Indian government 

 must now muster enough political will not only to imagine 

 a viable blueprint for the future but a road map on how 

 to reach there. And such a road map must include a healthy 

 dose of public participation.

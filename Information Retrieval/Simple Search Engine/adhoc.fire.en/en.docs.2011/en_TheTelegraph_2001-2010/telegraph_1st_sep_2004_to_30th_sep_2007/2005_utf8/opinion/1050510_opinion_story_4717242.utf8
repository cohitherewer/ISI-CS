 CRY FOUL

 One could dismiss it as a loser?s last gamble. But the abuses that Mr Laloo Prasad Yadav has hurled at the Election Commission are no laughing matter. Only superficially, the attack is against two members of the commission. Far more ominous is the threat it poses to the sanctity and independence of an institution so crucial to democracy. It would simply be preposterous to suggest that the railway minister?s fiefdom in Bihar was lost in the last assembly polls due to the commission?s alleged conspiracy against him. Obviously, Mr Yadav does not want to face up to the public anger that ended the corrupt and chaotic regime. An even more unedifying aspect of the episode is the way a senior officer of the Indian administrative services, Mr L.V. Saptharishi, provided fodder for Mr Yadav?s charges against the EC. The fundamental issue in this goes beyond whether Mr Saptharishi?s allegations against the two EC members are valid or not. It is not even particularly relevant if he had any personal motives for making the allegations. The real worry should be that a public servant should choose to make such complaints openly and thus seek to slander the EC. Since politicians are ever the usual suspects, it could be argued that the bureaucrat?s conduct has been more inglorious than the minister?s. 

 However, all is not lost yet, perhaps. The hope springs not only from the spirited defence by the chief election commissioner, Mr T.S. Krishnamurthy, of his two colleagues, but also from the way most political parties rose to defend the EC. The Congress?s response was of particular significance. As the leader of the ruling alliance, in which Mr Yadav?s Rashtriya Janata Dal is a major partner, the Congress could ill afford to antagonize him too much. Fortunately, the party decided that the defence of the EC was far more important than humouring a recalcitrant partner. Even the Communist Party of India (Marxist), usually a defender of Mr Yadav?s brand of politics, had little option but to call his bluff. Despite the responses from the parties, it may do the government?s image some good if it uses the occasion to commit itself to the autonomy of the EC. After all, the railway minister?s action may be seen as an embarrassment for the government as well. For some time, the EC has been keen to introduce electoral reforms. The first task seems to be to save the vote from cynical politicians.

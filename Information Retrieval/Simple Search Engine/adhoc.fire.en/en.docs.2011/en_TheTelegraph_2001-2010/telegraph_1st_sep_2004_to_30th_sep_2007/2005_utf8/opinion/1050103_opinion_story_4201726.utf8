 FOR THE PRESENT AND FUTURE

 DOCUMENT

 Excerpts from the 10th conference of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, December 2004

 Consider this

 The ultimate objective of this convention and any related legal instruments that the Conference of the Parties may adopt is to achieve, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the convention, stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Such a level should be achieved within a time-frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner.

 Article 3: Principles: In their actions to achieve the objective of the convention and to implement its provisions, the parties shall be guided, inter alia, by the following:

 1. The parties should protect the climate system for the benefit of present and future generations...on the basis of equity and in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities...The developed country parties should take the lead in combating climate change and the adverse effects thereof.

 2. The specific needs and special circumstances of developing country parties, especially those that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, and of those parties...that would have to bear a disproportionate or abnormal burden under the convention, should be given full consideration.

 3. The parties should take precautionary measures to anticipate, prevent or minimize the causes of climate change and mitigate its adverse effects. Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing such measures, taking into account that policies and measures to deal with climate change should be cost-effective so as to ensure global benefits at the lowest possible cost. To achieve this, such policies and measures should take into account different socio-economic contexts, be comprehensive, cover all relevant sources, sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases...and comprise all economic sectors...

 4. The parties have a right to, and should, promote sustainable development. Policies and measures to protect the climate system against human-induced change should be appropriate for the specific conditions of each party and should be integrated with national development programmes, taking into account that economic development is essential for adopting measures to address climate change.

 5. The parties should cooperate to promote a supportive and open international economic system that would lead to sustainable economic growth and development in all parties...Measures taken to combat climate change, including unilateral ones, should not constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised restriction on international trade. 

 Article 4: Commitments: 1. All parties, taking into account their common but differentiated responsibilities and their specific national and regional development priorities, objectives and circumstances, shall: 

 (a) Develop, periodically update, publish and make available to the CoP...national inventories of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol, using comparable methodologies to be agreed upon by the CoP;

 (b) Formulate, implement, publish and regularly update national and, where appropriate, regional programmes containing measures to mitigate climate change by addressing anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol, and measures to facilitate adequate adaptation to climate change;

 (c) Promote and cooperate in the development, application and diffusion, including transfer, of technologies, practices and processes that control, reduce or prevent anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol in all relevant sectors, including the energy, transport, industry, agriculture, forestry and waste management sectors;

 TO BE CONCLUDED

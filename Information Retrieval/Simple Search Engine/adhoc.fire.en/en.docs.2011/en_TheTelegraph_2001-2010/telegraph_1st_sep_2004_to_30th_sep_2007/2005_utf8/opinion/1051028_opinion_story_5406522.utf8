 BIG PICTURE

 Even a flawed peace makes better sense than endless violence. It is too early to say what shape and direction the peace talks with the United Liberation Front of Asom will take. But it would be no exaggeration to describe the first round of talks as historic. The fact that the militant outfit has agreed to talk peace after 27 years of an armed insurgency is a momentous occasion by itself. The three parties to the talks ? the Centre, the Assam government and the Ulfa ? must have worked hard in order to create the right climate for the peace process. If the first round did not discuss any substantive issues, that was only to be expected. Yet, it was good that two important notes have been struck at the first peace meeting. Only a political solution could end the strife, as the group rightly argued. At the same time, the solution has to be found, as the prime minister said, within the framework of the Indian Constitution. Even if these sounded rather obvious, it was important to reiterate them in order to put in place the guiding principles for the peace process. The two sides can discuss specific issues within the framework of these principles. Much the same approach has marked the peace negotiations with the Naga rebels. There is no reason why it should not work in the talks with the Assamese group.

 However, the progress of the talks could largely depend on what strategies the two sides now adopt in Assam. The Ulfa has chosen some members of the Assamese civil society to talk to New Delhi on its behalf. By doing so, the Ulfa has obviously sought to give the signal that Assamese society at large has a stake in the peace deal. But the group itself has to ultimately come out in the open in order to prove its sincerity for peace. Even before that happens, the group can do so by agreeing on a cessation of hostilities. True, the Indian army and other forces fighting militancy have to reciprocate such a move. But the initiative should come first from those who have taken up the gun against the state. It is one thing for an armed group to trigger incidents of violence and thereby terrorize the common people; it is a different matter to win a war against the state by such methods. Mr Manmohan Singh expressed the sentiment of the common Assamese when he said that time had come ?to end the chapter of violence? in Assam. Both sides need to be careful not to let small things cloud the big picture.

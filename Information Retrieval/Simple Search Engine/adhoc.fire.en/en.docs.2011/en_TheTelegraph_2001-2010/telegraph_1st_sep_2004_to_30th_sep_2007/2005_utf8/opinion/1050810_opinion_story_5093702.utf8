 Letters to Editor

 Bad boys

 Sir ? The rich and the famous, for example Bill Gates and Madonna, are reported to have consciously adopted a middle-class upbringing for their children. It is called the ?affluenza? vaccine, since they feel that giving the children the impression that their parents are very rich will spoil them. They do not buy toys or chocolates or clothes for them on their own. The child only gets something after he has asked for it for some time, so that on getting it, he appreciates it. In contrast, here are some nondescript traders (Maruti-owners can hardly be called rich) who have given their sons the mistaken impression that they are very rich, influential and that money can buy them everything (?Schoolboys held for eve-tease?, Aug 8). Boasting in a public place, ?Commissioner ka baapbhi kuch nahi kar sakega?, says a lot about their socio-cultural background and upbringing. It has become common nowadays for parents of young people, nabbed for wayward behaviour in a public place, to shout about harassment, and drop names in the belief that they are above the law. There was a time when they would have hung their heads in shame. The police did well to catch the brats so quickly ? it will help reaffirm people?s faith in the force. They may now consider sending parents of such youth for counselling in value education.

 Yours faithfully,

Chameli Pal, Batanagar 

 Sir ? This entire hullabaloo about eve-teasing and who is responsible for the moral degradation of the youth is futile because the people who ought to listen are not even being addressed. It is upto the mothers, I think, to educate their sons in such a way that they grow up to look upon women not as objects of desire and possession but as individuals. They must teach their sons to respect women irrespective of their attire or social standing. They must stop telling their sons not to ?cry like a girl? or ?be a sissy?! The home or the family is where one learns what to value in life. If young boys learn from their mother to value and respect women as they do men, then they will grow up to teach the same values to their sons. Mothers must also train their daughters to resist and protest. Young girls must grow up believing they have a say, that they have as many rights and duties as men do, that they ought to protest against wrongdoing. Men need to grow up. They need to realize that eve-teasing is disgraceful behaviour that puts them in the same category as other scoundrels.

 Yours faithfully,

Maushumi Guha, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Saturday night?s incident, in which some schoolboys were caught eve-teasing, was unfortunate. But equally unfortunate is the way the incident has been played up by the media because the victims were film personalities. A crime is a crime, whether committed by the rich or the poor. But the media projects crimes by the rich in such a way that it would seem as if the rich are not supposed to commit a crime. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Home truths

 Sir ? I disagree vehemently with Donald MacIntyre?s documentary alleging that disabled children are being ill-treated at a home run by the Missionaries of Charity in Calcutta (??Constructive criticism? with images of tethered children goes on air?, Aug 3). I volunteered in Calcutta for over a year, and have great respect and admiration for the organization and its work. I have never seen a child, adult or anyone in their care being mistreated. Anyone who has genuinely volunteered with the Missionaries of Charity knows that they put everything they have into their work, and do so for the love of god and humanity. The charity does not run high-tech hospitals and clinics and they do not claim to do so ? they are nuns, not doctors or politicians. I have spoken to many ex-volunteers about this, and they all support me in my horror at these claims. Calcutta should be proud of the missionaries. I am personally humbled by what they do on a daily basis.

 Yours faithfully,

 Verity Worthington, Worcestershire, UK

 Sir ? Donald MacIntyre?s documentary, especially the pictures of tethered children, have shaken people?s faith in Mother Teresa?s homes. The Missionaries of Charity has accepted the film as ?constructive criticism?. Isn?t this ironic? The ill-treatment, the irresponsibility and insensitiveness of the staff, is not new, as Macintyre shows. But the sisters are yet to take ?constructive? action. What stops them from putting the disabled children in better hands? Not money of course. Then why not act upon the criticism?

 Yours faithfully,

Aditi Purkayastha, Calcutta

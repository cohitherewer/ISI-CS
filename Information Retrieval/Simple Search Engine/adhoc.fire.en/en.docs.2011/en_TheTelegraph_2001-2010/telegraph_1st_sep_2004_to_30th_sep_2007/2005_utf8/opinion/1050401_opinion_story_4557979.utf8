 FRIVOLITY FINE

 A public interest litigation is not meant to muddy the waters. This seems to be the message in the Bombay high court?s decision to fine three petitioners who had asked for a judicial investigation into the police firing during the disturbances that followed the collapse of the Damanganga Bridge in 2003. The court found the PIL ?false and frivolous?, and the fact that the petitioners themselves have been charged by the police for being part of the disturbances did not improve matters. What is of importance in the judgment, however, is not the fact that the court has asked the petitioners to pay up a fine of Rs 25,000 within six weeks, but that it has distinguished between the trivial and the serious in a PIL. The list of PILs in the different courts would show that it has become urgent to make this distinction. It is very easy to use the instrument of the PIL indiscriminately, since it is one way of creating access to justice for underprivileged sections. Unfortunately, that is not what invariably happens. Instead, the overuse of the instrument foils, as the Bombay high court has said, the purpose and the spirit of the PIL. They become so much unnecessary baggage, cluttering up the court?s tables. 

 The best solution would be to disallow PILs altogether. The judiciary, too, would probably be less open to charges of over-activism without the necessity of having to pronounce strictures on air, water, pollution or foodstocks. But the removal of the instrument should be accompanied by a guarantee that departments of the administration and the executive will each do its job painstakingly and well. Without such a condition, disallowing all PILs would have serious disadvantages. A second way out would be a strict screening system, one which would not allow ?false? or ?frivolous? petitions to reach the judge?s table at all. The Bombay high court judges have done this very important job themselves. Next time, such petitions should be screened out before the court?s time is wasted.

 PUBLIC FAITH

 Science celebrates doubt, religion worships faith. The two domains are thus seen as two opposing poles of human experience and human enterprise. Hence the surprise at the fact that a group of Indian scientists connected with space research had sought the blessings of the deity at Tirupati. According to reports, some of the scientists had placed miniature replicas of a rocket about to be launched at the feet of the deity. The incident raises issues going beyond the obvious contradiction between religion and science. The action of the scientists highlights the grey area demarcating individual choice and institutional responsibility. The scientists, whether they like it or not, are engaged in a sphere of science that is sponsored by the Indian state. They owe a loyalty to the state that transcends their own personal beliefs. The state, which sponsors the programme in which they are engaged, espouses secularism. In other words, the state sees itself as being above religious faith and interests. Yet, the scientists have showed their religious bias. They have displayed their religious interests over and above the priorities of the state.

 The relationship between scientists and religion as distinct from science and religion has never been a straightforward one. Despite the fact that science is grounded in doubt, many of the famous scientists have been avowed believers in a divine power. One has only to recall Albert Einstein?s famous declaration that god does not play with dice. Both Galileo and Newton believed that they were trying only to discern god?s design. Robert Oppenheimer, when he saw the first atom bomb explode over the sky in Los Alamos, could only recall the verse from the Bhagavad Gita describing the splendour of the ?Mighty One?. But these scientists kept their scientific projects and queries separate and distinct from their private religious faith. C.V. Raman, another devout believer who followed many of the rituals associated with his religion, once explained to a student that his decision to fast during a solar eclipse was a personal choice and had nothing to do with his science. Perhaps, this distinction between the personal and the scientific lies at the root of the confusion of the scientists who went to Tirupati.

 Nobody questions the right of these scientists to have their own religious beliefs and to pursue their own religious practices. These belong to their own private domains. But as scientists, especially as scientists working on a state-sponsored project, they also have a public persona and responsibility. They cannot allow their private feelings to intrude into that part of their activity which belongs to the public domain. The confusion evident in the action of the scientists is not uncommon. It manifests itself in the activities of others who also hold public office. It is a common Indian malaise, which is a sign of the immaturity of the professional ethic in Indian social life.

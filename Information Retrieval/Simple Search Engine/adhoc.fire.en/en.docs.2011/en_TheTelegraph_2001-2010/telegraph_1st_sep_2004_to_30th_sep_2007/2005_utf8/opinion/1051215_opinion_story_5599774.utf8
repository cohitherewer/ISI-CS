 RISING HEAT

 There are two seemingly obvious statements that have left their imprint on the consciousness of the modern world. One is the maxim of the Utilitarians which holds up ?the greatest good of the greatest number? as the test for any public action and policy. The other is John Maynard Keynes?s epigram which announces that ?in the long run we are all dead?. The deliberations on climate change and global warming seem to be caught in the contradiction embedded in these two statements. Global warming caused by increasing carbon emissions is a long-term threat to planet earth. Many of the present inhabitants of the world may not be directly affected by global warming, and therefore they can choose to remain indifferent to what is a long-term and long-drawn-out impact. The Utilitarian maxim does not raise the question of time. Is it rational, it might well be asked, to make sacrifices in the present to achieve a collective good in the future? Yet the entire debate concerning climate change hinges on this question. The Kyoto Protocol, which now lies in tatters, failed because there was no agreement on the answer to this question. The costs of cutting carbon emissions are huge but the benefits are not immediate, although they are far-reaching.

 In this context, the pessimism that enveloped the global environment ministers? meeting in Montreal last week is understandable. The principal item on the agenda was the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol to which, it needs to be recalled, the United States of America was not a signatory. This remained a stumbling block in Montreal as well despite an eloquent plea to save the planet by the former US president, Mr Bill Clinton. This should not, however, encourage votaries of doom. For one thing, business houses seem to be undergoing a change of heart and have shown a willingness to look beyond their bottom line. Representatives of leading multinational companies met the British prime minister, Mr Tony Blair, to make the case that the G-8 rich-country group should enter into a global carbon-trading system. In the US, 100 cities and 24 states have evolved methods to curb greenhouse gases. It would appear that away from governments, there is an emerging consciousness among individuals and corporations about the perils confronting humankind. The failure of Kyoto may be compensated by man?s innate sense of survival.

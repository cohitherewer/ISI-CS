 TO DISCHARGE SOME KEY RESPONSIBILITIES

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the government of India?s status report on Disaster Management in India, August 2004

 The Geographical Information System data base is an effective tool for emergency responders to access information in terms of crucial parameters for the disaster affected areas. The crucial parameters include location of the public facilities, communication links and transportation network at national, state and district levels. The GIS database already available with different agencies of the government is being upgraded... A project for this purpose is being drawn up with a view to institutionalize the arrangements. The database will provide multi-layered maps on district-wise basis. These maps taken in conjunction with the satellite images available for a particular area will enable the district administration as well as state governments to carry out hazard zonation and vulnerability assessment, as well as coordinate response after a disaster. Recognizing the crucial importance of GIS as a decision support tool for disaster management, the ministry of home affairs proposes to establish a GIS database, National Database for Disaster Management, which will assist in hazard zonation, risk assessment, preparedness and emergency response management.

 In order to further strengthen the capacity for response, the fire services are proposed to be developed into multi-hazard response units... A project for this... has been drawn up. The commission has given in principle clearance to the project. The exercise for mobilization of resources is being undertaken. It is proposed to provide rescue tenders in addition to fire tenders to each fire unit and fill up all gaps upto subdivisional level. HazMat vans will be provided to state capitals and metropolitan cities. This will necessitate recruitment of additional fire men and drivers and intensive training...

 India has a large network of civil defence and Home Guards volunteers. The existing strength is about 1.2 million. However, this organization has not so far been associated with disaster mitigation, preparedness and response functions. It is proposed to revamp the civil defence organization to enable them to discharge a key responsibility in all the facets of disaster management including preparedness. A proposal in this regard has been finalized and is under consideration of the government.

 In the light of the experience of the Bhopal gas tragedy, the ministry of home affairs has been interacting with the ministry of environment amp; forests and new guidelines have been sent to the states for industries handling hazardous materials. It has been prescribed that onsite and offsite disaster response plans for the industries dealing with hazardous material be updated in consultation with district administration.... It has also been prescribed that these industries will carry out awareness campaign for the population in the vicinity regarding the dos/don?ts in case of any accident involving hazardous material.

 With the development of disaster management committees and disaster management teams at all levels including village/urban local body/ward level, the stage will be set for comprehensive preparedness measures to be taken with active participation of the community and non-governmental organizations.

 A special focus is being given to north-eastern states and the Andaman amp; Nicobar Islands. The North-Eastern Council has been made the nodal agency for the NE states. It has been provided with a resource person/advisor in disaster management. A detailed presentation on the vulnerabilities of the NE region and the need for comprehensive disaster management plan has been made... An action plan has been drawn up by NEC and a declaration, namely ?Shillong Declaration?, has been adopted by states in the NE region for integrating disaster management with development planning. About 140 officials and non-officials have been trained in disaster management... State and district level sensitization and training programmes are being carried out.

 A WHOLE NEW GAME 

 Gwynne Dyer

 Liberia is a country where 85 per cent of the population is unemployed, and where there are virtually no functioning schools or hospitals any longer. Almost a tenth of the population died in the 14-year civil war that ended two years ago, most of them not killed in combat but chopped to death by drugged-up child soldiers. For the past two years, it has been a United Nations protectorate, occupied by 15,000 UN soldiers. And now they are holding an election for the presidency.

 They have already held a round of voting that eliminated 20 of the 22 candidates, and on November 8, they get to choose between the two leaders. One is Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, a Harvard-educated economist who worked for the World Bank and who has the contacts and the skills to get the country the foreign help it desperately needs. The other is George Weah, a retired Liberian-born football hero who never went to school, has never held a job, and now lives in Florida.

 ?I don?t need political experience to give you schools,? Weah tell the voters, and a lot of them listen because his origins were as tough as theirs.

 Firm favourite

 George Weah was born in a slum, one of 13 children who were abandoned by their parents and raised by their grandparents in a hut on reclaimed swampland. It was his extraordinary skill at football that took him first to Cameroon, then to Europe, and eventually, to global recognition as the international footballer of the year.

 He is the idol of poor young men, most of whom are addicted to football ? and there are a lot of young men in Liberia: almost half its potential voters are under 30, and a quarter are actually under 23. That is why ?King George?, as they call him, will probably win the election but is this really a happy ending? What are the odds that this retired athlete with no formal education and no experience of either business or politics can run the country successfully, or even hold it together?

 Better than Johnson-Sirleaf?s, at least. She is a descendant of the freed American slaves who founded Liberia and though she bears no personal blame for their actions it is a crippling handicap politically. The American ex-slaves who were resettled on the West African coast proceeded to re-create the slavery society of the American south in an African context, with themselves on top.

 Difficult task

 The quarter-century of turmoil that has devastated Liberia began when sergeant Samuel Doe, an illiterate soldier, led a revolt that overthrew Americo-Liberian rule in 1980. Battles between various military groups became chronic and practically all of Liberia?s economy and infrastructure were destroyed. Maybe the killing is over now, but it depends a good deal on whether the new president can convince people that Liberia has really turned the corner.

 George Weah is undoubtedly less well equipped than Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf to run an efficient administration and rebuild the economy, but the fact is that it will be years before Liberia can provide either jobs or education for all those angry young men who fought in Liberia?s wars. If they lose patience, the country will tumble back into the horrors that it has just recently left behind. So the new president?s main task will be to persuade them to be patient, and Weah has at least a chance of doing that.

 He also stands a good chance of being killed. He left Liberia in fear of his life, after the dictator of the time, Charles Taylor, had his house burned for daring to suggest that Liberia needed UN intervention. He has come back to face a situation that is only slightly less dangerous, and he will need a lot of luck to pull Liberia through ? or even to come through the experience alive.

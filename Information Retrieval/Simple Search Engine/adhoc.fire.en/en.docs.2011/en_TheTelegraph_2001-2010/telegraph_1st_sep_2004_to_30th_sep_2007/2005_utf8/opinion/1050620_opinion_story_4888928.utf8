 SIBLING SQUABBLE

 Nobody is his brother?s keeper. This was true in the Garden of Eden and is true even now. The cry of Cain denying knowledge of his brother?s whereabouts reverberates with contemporary resonance even though today no one uses the sign of Cain to resolve sibling rivalries. Rivalry usually arises over competing claims on inheritance. In contemporary India, two daughters-in-law have fallen out trying to appropriate the Nehru-Gandhi legacy. Disputes over business empires are even more bitterly fought because the stakes are higher and more tangible; and also structures of shareholding are complex. In India, such disputes are made problematic as the transition to an industrial ethos and a professional ethic remains woefully inadequate. Business practices, especially in family-owned enterprises, are still informed by certain feudal notions. Under feudalism, inheritance passed automatically to the male first born according to the law of primogeniture. In modern industrial societies, the law of primogeniture has an antiquated ring to it. In modern laws of inheritance, property is more equitably divided among sons and daughters. Many Indian business families have successfully carved out their property and companies among legal successors. The division of the vast empire of G.D. Birla is an example although the controversy over the will of the widow of M.P. Birla has become a cause c?l?bre in legal circles. The settlement arrived at by the brothers Ambani, Mukesh and Anil, is an instance of the division of a vast business empire to stop sibling rivalry from entering the portals of a court of law.

 The Ambani brothers have been fortunate in many ways. Their father, the legendary Dhirubhai, built up India?s biggest industrial empire. Unfortunately, he died intestate. The consequent dispute between his two sons over the division of his legacy has been settled remarkably swiftly given the nature of the problem. The success and strength of the empire that Dhirubhai Ambani built are linked to the wide social base of the shareholding of the Reliance companies. This was a major innovation that Dhirubhai Ambani introduced to the Indian business world. This means that the Ambanis are responsible not only to themselves but also to a very wide cross-section of society who have shares in their companies and are thus inexpensive sources of raising capital from the market. The public nature of their enterprise meant that Messrs Mukesh and Anil Ambani could not allow their private quarrel to drag on. The shareholding structure of Reliance has had a determining influence on the settlement of a sibling squabble. This is a signpost in India?s transition to an industrial society where family affairs in a business have to give way to more public and professional responsibilities.

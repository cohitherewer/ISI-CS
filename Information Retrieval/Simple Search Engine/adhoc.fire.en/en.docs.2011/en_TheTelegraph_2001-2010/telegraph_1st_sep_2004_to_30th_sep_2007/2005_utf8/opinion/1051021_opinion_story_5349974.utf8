 FIELDS OF GOLD

 Once upon a summer afternoon

 Cricket All His Life By E.V. Lucas, Pavilion, ? 7.99

 Pavilion Books of London has done a yeoman service to cricket by publishing reprints of old titles, some of which were first published well over half a century ago. These titles are classics of cricket literature and would be eagerly welcomed by those who were initiated into the game later, but who may wish to have a taste of cricket literature of earlier periods.

 The titles include Farewell to Cricket by Don Bradman, Ranji by Alan Ross, Jack Hobbs by Ronald Mason, End of an Innings by Denis Compton as well as more recent ones like The Cricket Captains of England by Alan Gibson and Sort of a Cricket Person by E.W. Swanton.

 I would like to focus entirely on the oldest among the publications, Cricket All His Life, by E.V. Lucas. The talented writer was born in Sussex in 1868 and wrote extensively on a wide range of subjects. But cricket was his first love. He brought all the passion and romance of his life into his writings on cricket. His first book, Willow and Leather, published in 1898, was devoted entirely to cricket. Later in 1907 arrived The Hambledon Men, which established him as one of the foremost cricket-writers. Elegant prose and poems on cricket followed, until he contributed more substantially to a history of the Trentbridge in 1938, the year of his demise.

 In 1950, another brilliant writer, Sir Rupert Hart-Davis, compiled the best of Lucas?s writings. The result was the first edition of this masterly anthology of stories and poems, essays and anecdotes, jokes and history ? all penned in Lucas? inimitable style.

 Lucas?s elegant charm is reflected in his work. Before the era of Neville Cardus, he was among the most prominent presences in cricket literature. In this compilation, he is at his best as he delves into the history and spirit of the game, the skills of past heroes, his own boyhood dreams, and brings out cricket?s charm at various levels.

 Followers of cricket in India would be thrilled to learn that way back in 1891, an Indian gentleman in Lucknow by the name of Mohammed Abdullah Khan had published a cricket guide, the title of which ran into no less than 30 words. The document reveals the interest that the game of cricket had generated in India even in the 1890s. E.V. Lucas has very appropriately described Mohammed Abdullah Khan as the ?Nyren of India? for his effort, which happens to be among the pioneering works on Indian cricket.

 Pavilion must be thanked yet again for making such rare classics available to modern readers at a reasonable price.

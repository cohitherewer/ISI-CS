 OTHER TYRANNIES

 Government reports often end up stating the obvious. The report of a committee, set up to examine the causes of Naxalite violence, is no exception. The fact that the problem is rooted in the alienation of poor people, particularly tribals, from their land has long been known. It is also known that other social and economic inequalities drive these people to extremist politics of one kind or another. There are local variations, but such are usually the factors behind Naxalite violence in all the states affected by it. More important than the report, therefore, is the government?s will to seriously deal with the issues behind the problem. The question of the government?s strategy has acquired an urgency in view of the failure of talks between the Maoists and the Andhra Pradesh government. The extremists, who have defied the ceasefire, will have only themselves to blame if New Delhi is forced to re-impose the ban on the Communist Party of India (Maoist). 

 However, nothing short of a holistic approach will really help. Successive governments have identified this to be a socio-economic, rather than a law and order, problem. The Centre cannot afford to take a partisan view, considering the fact that both the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party face the challenge in the states ruled by them. Besides, the issues of land and other deprivations should concern both parties and their governments equally. The problem is that political parties are used to treating the poor as pawns in their electoral games. Promises are made during the elections and some largesse distributed to buy their votes. It is understandable why politicians and governments shy away from getting to the basics. Redistribution of land and other institutional interventions to end the inequalities would upset deeply entrenched interests in rural society. The government must act decisively to put down the Maoist violence; but it also must work to free the poor from other tyrannies.

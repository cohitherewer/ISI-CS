 The Rigours of Silence 

 - An essay, a portrait and the subaltern woman 

 ART amp; LIFE 

 AVEEK SEN

 ??I know such gestures can 

 never suffice.? ? Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, ?Can the 

 Subaltern Speak??

 Life, Art and Theory: the most 

 natural, yet also the most difficult, threesome. Two events 

 recently dovetailed in my life to afford a fleeting insight 

 into this troubled coexistence. Together with some friends 

 at work, I read, for the first time, Gayatri Chakravorty 

 Spivak?s 1988 essay, ?Can the Subaltern Speak?? It took 

 us a few weeks to sink our teeth into the densities, now 

 legendary, of Spivak?s thinking and writing. Hard, but rewarding 

 weeks, during which something else was happening at home, 

 simultaneously. 

 My friend, Chandana, who had rented 

 a room in our house to live and paint in, was finishing 

 a portrait, in oil, of Shondhadi, the woman who has 

 been coming in to work for us for the last twenty years. 

 Most evenings, after we?d both finish work, Chandana would 

 tell me, among other mundane things, of her deepening and 

 difficult friendship with Shondhadi, a relationship she 

 always described in terms of daily, domestic proximity (?nearness?) 

 and of ?love?. Yet, I felt, on Chandana?s part, a strange 

 diffidence about presuming to claim this increasing closeness 

 for herself. An unbridgeable distance separated the two 

 women, and Chandana was both pained by and in awe of this 

 unbridgeability. But inevitably, there grew, across this 

 distance, what she called a ?fullness? of mutual feeling 

 and attempted empathy, which expressed itself, quite frenetically, 

 through a series of watercolour studies of Shondhadi, and 

 then, finally, this large painting.

 Shondhadi is a tiny woman in her 

 early forties. The elfin fragility of her person, her silent, 

 cat-like movements about the house, her delicate little 

 giggles, the neatness of her attire express not only a subtle, 

 humane and finely comic intelligence, but also an equally 

 cat-like and unmelodramatic ability to survive physical 

 adversity. She had dropped out of ?Mother Teresa?s school? 

 to marry a travelling juggler and magician, who soon took 

 to drugs. His addiction quickly got worse, and when Shondhadi 

 was unable to give him children within a few years, he started 

 to live with her sister, who bore him three sons and a daughter. 

 By this time, he was beating up both women and taking away 

 their money to buy drugs. During one of these fights, he 

 shot at Shondhadi with a popgun, hitting her left eye. She 

 lost the eye, and the bullet remains lodged inside the socket 

 to this day, giving her frequent migraines. She also wears 

 enormous glasses that heighten the gritty, unsentimental 

 clownishness of her being, but also bring out its core of 

 grimness. They make her look like a little girl who is refusing 

 to take off her grandfather?s spectacles. The two sisters 

 now live together in a slum with the children. Their man 

 appears from time to time to ask for money and food; he 

 seems to have been put in his place. But Shondhadi refuses 

 to leave her sister and the children to come and live with 

 us day and night.

 Shondhadi, then, is a woman ?doubly 

 in shadow?, one of the ?females of the urban subproletariat? 

 in the third world who form the ?silent, silenced centre? 

 of Spivak?s essay. She is, by that definition, a subaltern. 

 And ? ?The subaltern cannot speak.? This is the terminal 

 answer to what the essay?s title asks. The disconcerting 

 brevity of this answer is wilfully and perversely disproportionate 

 to the long, hard road Spivak makes her readers travel in 

 order to get to it. The unique problem of her essay is that 

 the place of its subject is empty. This emptiness at once 

 confronts, eludes, frustrates and resists, or is, simply 

 and metaphysically, other than, different from and thus 

 indifferent to, the consciousness and the conscience (the 

 French conscience stands for both) forming the essayist?s 

 material and intellectual ?positionality?, the conscience 

 of the languages, methods, questions and assumptions by 

 which she defines the subject of her essay and then attempts 

 to grasp this subject as a form of knowledge that may be 

 ?spoken? within the institutions and practices of such knowledge. 

 The heart of Spivak?s essay, then, 

 is a place of ?disappearance?. But instead of being a ?pristine 

 nothingness?, it is inhabited by ?something other than silence 

 and non-existence?. As a place, it is inescapably fraught, 

 gridded with ?Power, Desire, Interest?, each trying to perform 

 its own vanishing trick. Here an unspeaking otherness confronts 

 another conscience to produce ?a violent shuttling? 

 ? between ?subject-constitution? and ?object-formation?, 

 between having a ?voice-consciousness? and being given one, 

 between being able to speak and being spoken of or spoken 

 for, between being silent and being silenced.

 For Spivak, this is, crucially, 

 a problem of ?representation?. And this is also the word 

 that bridged the two events for me ? reading Spivak?s essay 

 and watching Chandana paint Shondhadi. ?Are those who act 

 and struggle mute, as opposed to those who act and 

 speak?? the essay asks emphatically. And not making 

 this distinction would mean running together the two senses 

 of representation: ?representation as ?speaking for?, as 

 in politics, and representation as ?re-presentation?, as 

 in art or philosophy.? The former is a proxy, while the 

 latter is a portrait. These two senses, like the two senses 

 of conscience, are ?related but irreducibly discontinuous? 

 ? the buried differences within words, which, when exhumed, 

 open up rents and chasms in the apparently seamless textures 

 of knowledge and power. 

 The peasants in Marx?s Eighteenth 

 Brumaire ?cannot represent themselves; they must be 

 represented.? This was an epigraph to Said?s Orientalism, 

 and Spivak uses the same passage to warn against, as Marx 

 does, the conflation of meanings ? ?sleight of word? ? by 

 which it becomes easy to protect ourselves from the fact 

 that to confront ?them? is not to represent them, but to 

 learn to re-present ourselves. 

 Through the jagged rigour of Spivak?s 

 critique, there breaks out, every now and then, a personality 

 (as much as a ?positionality?) that ?shuttles? like its 

 shadowy subject, but between existential awkwardness and 

 theoretical flourish. This personality is informed with 

 a flamboyantly irreverent professional confidence in being 

 able to expose the ?meaningless pieties? of certain theoretical 

 positions. Yet, this confidence is inseparable from a sense 

 of the precariousness of its own position, the insufficiency 

 of its own gestures, the inherent presumption, and violence, 

 of wanting to grasp and know other consciousnesses, to repeatedly 

 invoke shadows and silences, absences and disappearances, 

 only to work over them a relentless swirl of languages, 

 the clamour of one?s own consciousness and conscience.

 Gayatri and Chandana were both 

 confronting a radical unbridgeability. All they could ultimately 

 bring to this was the rigour and integrity, as well as the 

 difficult, troubling pleasures, of their intellectual and 

 artistic labour. But there is also a fundamental difference 

 between their separate struggles with representation. What 

 the subaltern cannot do is speak , and in Spivak?s 

 essay, quite literally so: ?the subject of exploitation 

 cannot know and speak the text of female exploitation?. 

 Yet it is precisely this textuality, with its injunction 

 to speech, that the essayist must make her medium. For Spivak 

 ? critic, theorist, translator ? there can be no deliverance 

 from language, and therefore from its institutionalized 

 production of meaning and value. Even when she turns from 

 the rigours of theory to the succour of literature ? to 

 Mahasveta Devi, for instance ? the Breast-Giver?s bountiful 

 mammaries cannot escape the rule of metaphor. There, too, 

 in the ?effect of the real?, the subaltern woman cannot, 

 simply and bafflingly, be. When not History, she 

 is Parable, ?the vehicle of a greater meaning?. 

 It is, therefore, in the necessary 

 speechlessness of painting, its circumvention of language 

 (though not of signification), that Chandana sought a different 

 kind of resolution to the problem of representation. Her 

 struggle was to find a silence that would do justice to 

 another woman?s silence, and then to let these two silences 

 create a presence that would be proxy as well as portrait. 

 The silence of her painting is more absolute than reticence 

 ? for reticence (?I know, but I choose not to speak?) comes 

 on its own high horse. But this is the silence of what the 

 work cannot say, the assertion of an incapacity, a negative 

 capability. ?We exist on different planes,? Chandana would 

 say about herself and Shondhadi. But she kept trying to 

 describe to me the feel of the thickness and softness of 

 pigments as the brush pressed them, layer upon layer, over 

 the stretched, but yielding canvass. That feel is, for her, 

 the sensual, even sexual, correlative of what she called 

 ?the merging of existences? in the making of a picture ? 

 of existences that otherwise must remain painfully and awfully 

 apart. 

 Chandana?s painting of Shondhadi 

 is a frontal impasto portrait, done mainly in two 

 of the most poisonous pigments used by painters ? ultramarine 

 blue and zinc oxide. She looks unflinchingly at the viewer 

 with her good eye, dimly magnified by her huge, high-power 

 glasses placed slightly askew on her face. The bad eye is 

 like a single, shrivelled, but virulently yellow petal, 

 shot with crimson, which also stains the corner of her forehead 

 and streaks her hair. The picture stands in my room now 

 ? a gift from the artist when she moved out of our house. 

 Shondhadi comes in to dust my room, and hardly ever notices 

 the painting. But when I draw her attention to it sometimes, 

 she gives a sharp little giggle and brings out that most 

 dismissive of words in the Bengali language ? ?Dhoorr!?

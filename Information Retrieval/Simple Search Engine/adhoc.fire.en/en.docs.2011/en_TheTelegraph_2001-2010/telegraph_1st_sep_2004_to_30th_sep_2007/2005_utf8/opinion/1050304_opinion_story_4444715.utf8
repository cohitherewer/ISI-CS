 FIXED IMAGE

 - Sentiments in light and shade

Re-visioning the past: Early photography in Bengal 

1875-1915

By Malavika Karlekar, 

Oxford, Rs 795

This is emphatically not a book of photographs. On 

the contrary, it is an attempt to read photographs as a source for history writing. 

This by itself lends novelty to Malavika Karlekar?s book. The rare photographs 

she has unearthed in the course of her research are the added attraction and bonus.

 The camera never lies, so the saying goes. But the camera frames the world. Thus, in an indirect way, a photograph always refers the viewer to what is not in it. A photograph, by its very nature, can only depict what the photographer chooses to show, and even this choice is determined by the available light and shade. Despite the limits of the photograph as a document for the historian to read and analyse, there is an element of factual mirroring which a social historian can ill afford to ignore. Now, of course, the claims of photography to represent reality have been further eroded by advances in technology. It is now electronically possible to manipulate photographs. Fortunately, Karlekar?s documents are not open to such hazards.

 Photography came to Europe in the late 1830s. Within 50 years, it had arrived in Calcutta, for Vidyasagar was able to persuade his mother to be photographed by a British photographer at the home of a well-known zamindar. ?By doing so,? Karlekar writes, ?he was reflecting a growing urban, middle class sentiment: an enthusiasm for having one?s image ?fixed? by the revolutionary new medium.?

 It wasn?t the urban middle class alone who showed an eagerness to use the camera. The colonial state began to use the new medium for surveillance and governance. To rule India, the British had to record and document. The camera?s claim to visually capture facts made it a very valuable medium for the empire. ?The official uses of photography in 19th century India had very clear objectives. The collection of usual ? and often secret ? information was combined with visuals that boasted of the panoply of empire.? Photography became an aid to power.

 But Karlekar?s principal focus is the way the Bengali middle class took to being photographed. It took to photography to depict family life and their new professional and social roles. She discusses also the contributions of three Bengali pioneers ? Rajendralala (sic) Mitra, Maharaja Birchandra of Tripura and Upendrakishore Raychaudhuri. What is amazing about the bhadralok response to the emergence of photography was the number of bhadramahila who agreed to be photographed. Not all of them were from the folds of the enlightened ? the likes of the Tagore girls or Toru Dutt and her sister. Even Rajendralala Mitra?s widowed sister was photographed with her rosary beads and all. 

 Karlekar has mined a new field, and her reading of her evidence is never overburdened with theory.

 LOOK BACK WITHOUT ANGER

 China and Japan have to be more pragmatic in reading their common history, both past and more recent, argues N.J. Nanporia

 In battle gear

 Before the recent set-back in China-Japan ties which followed China?s sudden cancellation of the visit of a top diplomat to Japan and its criticism of the Japanese leaders? visit to the Yasukuni shrine for the war dead, Tokyo and Beijing had agreed to ?form a joint committee to study their common history?. This is a very east Asian way of calling for a temporary suspension of ?hostilities?. And China had good reason to do so. In remote eastern China, almost coinciding with the anti-Japan demonstrations, thousands of villagers rioted in protest against factory pollution. Traditionally, as Beijing has always known, protests of this kind have had a way of developing into a major crisis and threatening the communist leadership. 

 Tokyo also had its reasons. It wanted a cool-off period in which to digest the alarming implications of the eruption of hard feelings against Japan. Not that it hadn?t had warning signals. In 1998, North Korea had fired a ballistic missile over Japan and in 1996, China had fired a ballistic missile over Japan during the Taiwan crisis. Later, Pyongyang had fired a short-range missile into the Sea of Japan.

 The Chinese, as also the North Koreans, are a pragmatic people with their feet firmly on the ground. They could not have not known that under provocation, Tokyo would respond in precisely the way its neighbours would find disturbing ? by a revisionist look at its supposedly pacifist constitution, by upgrading its defence forces, by joining the United States of America in building up a ballistic missile defence system, by reviving nationalist feeling, and by bringing to the surface such ideas as creative action and even nuclear armament. The hostile demonstrations in ten Chinese cities were almost a pointed invitation by Beijing to see the event as being deliberately sponsored by the nation?s leadership. But why?

 One probable reason is the trend towards a more assertive Japan with a greater military clout and a new constitution in keeping with its status as a leading economic power. Billions of dollars have been allocated for a ballistic missile shield, for sophisticated weapons and all that is required to transform the ?self-defence? force into a tightly knit professional army. Parallel to this is the steady erosion of the post-war pacifist spirit, a keener perception of the threats to the nation?s security, and an increasingly expedient interpretation of Article 9, which renounces war.

 The Japanese constitution is regarded as one of those highly romanticized ideals the Americans tend to impose on their victims in their self-appointed role as agents of ?civilization?. That an imposed constitution demeans the nation on which it is imposed has impressed itself on the collective Japanese mind. No surprise that Tokyo is now upgrading its defence agency into a full-fledged ministry with a crisis-control system and special elite military units which will not be restricted to non-combat missions. A few decades ago, a senior British Royal Air Force officer on a visit to Japan reported on its plans for a stealth fighter that was ?a generation ahead of anything in the West?. Some years ago a Japanese prime minister confirmed publicly that Japan had the capability to make nuclear weapons. If the full extent of Tokyo?s military clout, actual and potential, is not known or has not been publicized, it is because of the distinction between what the Japanese call tatemae (outer show) and honne (inner reality). Article 9, and the pacifism it generated, advertized the first and concealed the second. Yet rearmament, in the present conditions, is not necessarily militarism, though this is the conclusion Beijing has glibly arrived at to serve its own ends. 

 Related to this is the very specialized Japanese concept of an ?apology?. It is an expression of regret, not for the act, but for the suffering, the ?hurt feelings?, the chaos and the ?inconvenience? it inevitably caused. There is nothing duplicitous in this. The Japanese do sincerely feel sorry for the consequences of its actions but not for anything else. As for the brutality and atrocities, which war has been untainted? 

 If by looking back at history, as Beijing has recommended Tokyo to do, it thinks it can demand an apology, it should first consider the humiliation it suffered during the West?s dominance in the Pacific region. The degradation it underwent is nothing comparable in the history of any other Asian or African country. True, Japan?s war was imperialistic but it ultimately brought the British Empire and other related Western empires tumbling down and laid the foundations of an Asian renaissance. History on Chinese lips and as recounted by the West has scant references to this. And no attempt has been made to place the Yasukuni shrine affair in its proper perspective.

 The shrine is not a ?symbol of Japanese militarism?. Nor does it honour 14 major war criminals and millions of other war dead for whatever they are alleged to have done by the victors. It shows respect for that peculiar Japanese sentiment for what is known as ?sincerity?. 

 During the Thirties, the fascists hunted down senior, liberal old-school politicians, storming into their homes and cutting them down. Each such assassination was followed by the established ritual of lighting incense sticks that symbolized acknowledgment of the victims? ?sincerity? in the beliefs they held and the things they had done. Disapproval or approval of them was beside the point. Genuine belief had to be honoured. 

 In the days of the fascist rampage and just prior to the war, foreigners gathered at the ports to be evacuated. Tension ran high. But their Japanese friends came to see them off. Local officials moved to arrest them but a senior military official intervened to stop this, declaring openly that such expressions were ?sincere? and admirable. A Japanese ambassador to a European country issued visas to fleeing Jews on the eve of and during World War II, though this was contrary to Tokyo?s official policy. When he returned home his humanitarian motives were highly commended because they were ?sincere?. But he was immediately demoted.

 So there is more to the shrine and to Junichiro Koizumi?s annual visits than is generally understood. The ambassador?s reprimand had nothing to do with his ?sincerity? just as the politician?s assassination had nothing to do with theirs, or just as Japanese friendship with the foreign evacuees had anything to do with national disloyalty. 

 As for textbooks, what they contain and how subject they are to revisionism depends on a nation?s education policy. Education in England was closely related to discharging its imperial responsibilities. Britain?s interpretations of the Mutiny of 1857 has never been in agreement with India?s but that hasn?t stopped it from being reflected in books for school and general consumption.This is an area where bias in various degrees cannot be excluded, and if Japan?s textbooks are flawed, then they are in good company. Chinese textbooks also credit China alone for the victory against Japan. 

 So whatever Koizumi decides about his shrine visits, it is for China and others to ?face up? to history and shed their war-time complexes. Hu Jintao and Koizumi had reportedly agreed not to debate Japan?s war-time history or Japanese politicians? visit to the Yasukuni shrine, which indicated good sense of the part of Beijing. But it seems to have gone back on its word. As for Tokyo, it is perhaps too late to go into a reverse gear so far as its thoughts on its constitution and rearmament are concerned. 

 There are substantive differences between the two countries, as also a health sense of rivalry. The economic stakes for both are also enormous. Strongly embedded in all this is a growing yet unacknowledged Japanese realization that the American shield is no longer as reliable as it was once thought to be. Whether Tokyo?s perception of a Chinese threat becomes stronger or is replaced by a less unsettling political configuration is the crucial question that has yet to be clearly asked and clearly answered.

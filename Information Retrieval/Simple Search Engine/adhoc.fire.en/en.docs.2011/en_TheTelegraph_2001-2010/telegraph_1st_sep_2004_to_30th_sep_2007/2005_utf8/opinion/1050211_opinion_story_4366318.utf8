 RHYTHM REMEMBERED

 - A moving, if occasionally self-indulgent, account of a rich life

 Sarabhai in Chandalika, Santiniketan, 1939

THE VOICE OF THE HEART: AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY

By Mrinalini Sarabhai, 

HarperCollins, Rs 495

The Voice of the Heart is exactly what one 

expects it to be ? the outpourings of one of India?s greatest dancers who took 

the Indian dance form outside the country and experimented with it to produce 

an idiom that transcended the banal and stereotyped categories of classical, pure 

or traditional. The autobiography is however, not about the dance form she works 

with but with her life, location and intersection with the larger world that she 

was exposed to by virtue of her familial connections and her creative work. It 

is this element that makes the work an archive of sorts besides being a moving 

even if occasionally self-indulgent reflection of a rich life lived to the full. 

But that is a licence one can legitimately and willingly extend to an artist of 

Mrinalini Sarabhai?s stature.

 The narrative starts with a poignant description of her family background and childhood that emphasizes simply but forcefully the larger social context of change in late colonial India and one which produced a network of family, social and professional connections that supported an impressive array of creative activity. What is particularly revealing in Mrinalini?s account is not only the talents of her exceptionally gifted father but the vitality and cosmopolitan aspect of the larger community in which Subburama Swaminadhan operated first as student, who was befriended by a series of astute teachers like Padmanabha Aiyer in Kozhikode and subsequently by Dr Miller, the principal of Madras Christian College. Mrinalini?s mother represents an equally interesting facet of the changing social universe of elite groups in late colonial India. An active Congress worker, she was, according to Mrinalini, remote in her dealings with her children. The sketches of her mother?s social life and political career, of their own exposure to an international circuit are fascinating and enable the reader to make sense of the rich and unusual cultural inheritance that enabled Mrinalini to articulate her own passions for dance forcefully as well as to locate her within a larger community of elite publicists and women who undertook in their individual ways a self-conscious engagement with culture, tradition and modernity. Mrinalini?s sojourn in Santiniketan is especially illuminating as she describes the poet?s encouragement in her first attempts at serious choreography and in exposing her to multiple dance forms.

 The association with Vikram Sarabhai, the courtship and marriage that followed and her integration into the Sarabhai household is recorded with extreme sensitivity and elegance. Vikram remains something of an enigma barring occasional snapshots of his obvious affection for his children. What strikes the reader is the mutual respect and reciprocity that seems to have characterized their relationship, where each accommodated professional work and personal commitment with an ease and understanding that were never exaggerated.

 As an autobiography of a dancer, however, the book is disappointing. There is admittedly a sense of the deep passion that Mrinalini felt about her dance and about the need to establish an institutional space where tradition was covalent with dynamism and individual improvisation was given total freedom. There is also, one might say, the stock references to cosmic patterns and spiritual energy but what is lacking is how she came to conceptualize her own position on classical Indian dance, how she located herself in the emerging debate on classical and non-classical forms of dance and what kind of role she envisaged for modern institutions that took over what was essentially a one-to-one oral relationship between the preceptor and the pupil.

 The book is beautifully illustrated with photographs from the family album that have their own story to tell of early 20th century conjugality, of women in modern India and of Mrinalini?s life in the Sarabhai household. It is an easy read and a welcome addition to the growing literature on memoirs of performing women artists whose stories resonate with rich tones of memory, expression and experience.

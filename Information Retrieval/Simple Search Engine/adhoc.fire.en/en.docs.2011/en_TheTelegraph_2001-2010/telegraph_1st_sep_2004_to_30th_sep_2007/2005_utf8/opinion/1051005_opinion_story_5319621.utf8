 ELEVEN HOURS OF DARKNESS

 ONE DAY IN THE LIFE OF

 On September 29, India was on the move while Bengal celebrated a bandh

 My job took me to Delhi seven years ago. However, I have always taken pride in the fact that I did not become a Delhiite, but remained every bit a Calcuttan as I was. My friends say that I treat Calcutta as the Jews do Israel. I jump at the smallest reference to Calcutta in the Delhi newspapers, and cannot do without my copy of Anandabazar Patrika every day. One disparaging remark about Calcutta from a colleague, neighbour or friend, and I am ready to parade all the virtues of my great city ? most of them real, a few imaginary.

 Coming back to Calcutta is a feeling impossible to express in words. Even when the reason is one?s 75-year-old father-in-law?s surgery. The Sealdah-Rajdhani was supposed to bring me to Calcutta on September 29. Yes, there was a nation-wide general strike that day, an event that would take some finding in Delhi papers, but one that, as my Anandabazar informed me, took up most of the Page-one column-space in Calcutta newspapers. It is a ?strike?, not a ?bandh?, I reasoned before boarding the train, and Calcutta under Buddha-babu is not the work-shy city it used to be.

 Dhanbad was the first stop on the morning of the 29th. Passengers were waiting for the train to start so that breakfast could be served. As the minutes ticked by and the train refused to budge, a few of us ventured out to inquire. We were told in no uncertain terms that our ordeal had just begun. Nothing was moving beyond Asansol, we heard, and no one knew when they would. It was 7 am, and none of us was prepared for what was to follow. 

 Not everyone on the train was young and able-bodied. A two-year-old infant, running a high fever, was crying without a pause, while her mother wept out of sheer helplessness. A old lady had turned pale with anxiety: she was travelling alone, and was scared of what would happen if she reached Calcutta late at night. (I did my two-bit by offering my mobile phone so she could talk to her folks in Calcutta). In another corner, an elderly gentleman was having breathing problems, and his son and daughter-in-law were trying to get as much fresh air as was possible inside the claustrophobic compartment. I wondered what ?great cause? the miseries of these children and infirm people were serving. Perhaps their ?sacrifice? would change the Centre?s economic policies!

 And that is how things remained for eleven hours: India was on the move while Bengal celebrated a bandh. Halfway into our seemingly interminable wait, passengers from outside Bengal started showering their choicest expletives on Bengal in general and Calcutta in particular. To my horror, I found I had neither the will nor courage to protest. 

 We reached Sealdah at midnight, and braced ourselves for another long wait at the station, for the bandh would not be over till daybreak. I got lucky, and got a cab ? of course, after I agreed to pay Rs 400 for a 90-rupee ride. I remembered the words of a friend in Delhi who had called during the day to ask if I had reached safely. On hearing that the train was stuck, he said, ?Thank god we stay far away from the great city of yours.? I felt no anger, no bitterness. Just the sadness of a man who has just had to give up his faith.

 Truth is a pathless land

The three princes of Persia: children in world 

myth (Puffin, Rs 195) by Rohini Chowdhury collects, for young 

readers, twenty mythological stories from all over the world, each featuring a 

child centrally. There are classic tales from Persia, India, Egypt, Greece, Rome, 

Africa, China and Japan; legends from the Celts, native Americans, Maoris, Aztecs, 

Mayans and the Old Testament. The less well known fables include the one of Cuchulainn 

and his valour as a child soldier, and of Wen P?eng, the Chinese boy who turns 

into a dragon. The title story describes the childhood adventures of three of 

Persia?s great princes ? Zal the White-haired, Rustan the Valiant and Sohrab the 

Smiling.

 The AFSPA: lawless law enforcement according to the law? (Asian Centre for Human Rights, Rs 400) is a representation to the committee reviewing the Armed Forces Special Powers Act, 1958. It focuses on Assam and Manipur and deals mainly with a series of ?summary, arbitrary and extrajudicial executions? allegedly carried out by the armed forces. This report is informed by the following conviction: ?The suggestion that human rights violations are permissible in certain circumstances is wrong. The essence of human rights is that human life and dignity must not be compromised and that certain acts, whether carried out by State or non-State actors, are never justified no matter what the ends.?

On truth (EastWest, Rs 200) by J. 

Krishnamurti collects interviews and pontifications on the nature of truth 

as a ?pathless land?. According to JK, truth arises when effort ceases, the mind 

is empty, and there is only the present moment. We learn that truth comes uninvited, 

?with glory?, when one puts all in order.

The kutch earthquake 2001: Rrecollections, lessons 

and insights (National Institute of Disaster Management, price not mentioned) 

by Pramod K. Mishra documents the lessons and insights gained by people 

who handled the aftermath of the Kutch earthquake of 2001. The book is not only 

about memories of the disaster, but it also effectively pinpoints the strengths, 

lacunae and new initiatives, covering a range of issues, from setting up an improved 

institutional mechanism to ensuring adequate community participation.

 LITTLE TO MOURN FOR

 GWYNNE DYER

 After two weeks of dithering and delay, the Chin-ese Communist Party permitted a low-key memorial ceremony for the disgraced former premier, Zhao Ziyang, at Beijing?s Babaoshan cemetery for communist heroes this Saturday. He was often portrayed as China?s lost Gorbachev, the reformer who might have democratized China if he had not been ousted from power at the time of the Tiananmen Square crisis in 1989.

 That was why the country?s current rulers were so nervous about publicly acknowledging Zhao?s death, and why even now the regime?s police are beating up citizens who appear in public wearing white mourning flowers in his memory. But he was actually one of the last of the ancient breed of communist true believers. They will not be missed.

 Zhao was born at a time when fanatical ideologies were sweeping Europe and Asia, and he never deviated from his loyalty to the Communist Party whose youth wing he joined at 13. He did not even object when his father was murdered by communists as a ?rich peasant? in 1948.

 Party first

 When collectivization led to famine in Guangdong province in 1958-61, he led the campaign to torture peasants whom Mao accused of causing the famine by hiding their (imaginary) grain reserves. His subservience to the party was not even shaken when his elderly mother died after being denounced by the Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution. 

 By the late Seventies Zhao had become one of Deng Xiao-ping?s allies in opening up the Chinese economy to capitalist ideas, and by the late Eighties he was even dabbling in notions of political reform. When university students occupied Tiananmen Square in 1989 and demanded political change, he sympathized with them ? but when the party elders insisted that the protests must be supressed, he submitted to party discipline. 

 But the last of the communist true believers are dying off in China now. In their place, in a party as riddled with cynic-ism and corruption as the Sov-iet Communist Party in Gorbachev?s time, is a band of careerists whose mutual loyalty depends on the fact that they must hang together lest they hang separately. Their only claim to popular support is the economic miracle that they have allegedly wrought in modern China ? but the real question is whether China would be better off if their genuinely communist predecessors had never seized power at all.

 Good riddance

 In the dying days of the old Soviet Union, it became popular to calculate how much better off Russia would have been if the communists had not seized power in late 1917. At the start of World War I in 1914, Russia had reached about the same level of urbanization and industrialization as Italy, and was growing about as fast. Despite two world wars and the Great Depression, by 1989, the Italians were about three times richer than the Russians, and the gap remains as wide even today. 

 It is harder to make the same argument for China, which was scarcely industrialized at all when the communists seized power in 1949. Communist rule merely redistributed misery and produced very little net growth during their first 30 years in power ? and they caused the deaths of nearly 40 million Chinese through murder and starvation.

 The subsequent 25 years have seen rapid economic growth, but it?s hard to believe that even the most corrupt and incompetent nationalist regime would have delivered less net growth since 1949. 

 Zhao changed as he aged, becoming less fanatical and abandoning his old enthu-siasm for murder and torture as useful political tools, and he always meant to do good for China. But if he is the last of the ancient breed, good riddance.

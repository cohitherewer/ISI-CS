 FAIR RETURN

 It is ironic that the meeting of the board of trustees of the Employees Provident Fund scheme will have to consider a cut in the rate of interest for the scheme at a time when rates are headed northwards in the rest of the financial sector. The Reserve Bank of India has, in its recent review of monetary policy, warned of the inflationary pressures in the economy on the one hand, and there have been calls for a fairer deal to bank depositors on the other. That the EPF trustees may have to reduce interest rates at this juncture is therefore a reflection of how far these rates are out of line with those in the rest of the economy. Consider, for example, the fact that the 10-year Central government bond has a yield to maturity of around 7.1 per cent, or that the 17-year bond earns a return of 7.5 per cent, while the interest rate on deposits in the EPF scheme is as high as 9.5 per cent. The only reason that employees have continued to get such a high rate of interest on the PF is because the unions and the left have been able to successfully put off the inevitable. It can be argued, of course, that if they have been able to stall the move towards lower interest rates so far, they should have little difficulty in stalling it now, when the case for lower rates has weakened, thanks to the turn in the interest rate cycle. But that argument does not take into account the fact that the scheme no longer has a cushion to dole out higher-than-market returns. The problem for the trustees is therefore a simple one ? the returns on its investments are insufficient to pay such a high rate of interest. So far the problem has been swept under the carpet by dipping into reserves, but reports now say that there is no money left in them. And since the government is unwilling to provide an interest subsidy, there is no alternative to lower interest rates if the scheme is to live within its means.

 Should the rate be reduced to 8.25 per cent, as recommended by the finance ministry? With the 17-year government of India security at 7.5 per cent, and with an illiquidity premium thrown in, 8.25 per cent appears to be a very reasonable rate of return. The bigger challenge, of course, is to link the rate on EPF with market rates. At the same time, allowing a proportion of the fund to be invested in equity could help it deliver higher returns.

 ON THE FACE OF IT

 The eyes of the beholder can be a source of trouble. They seem to have disconcerted Sony Entertainment Television, since the television rating points of its popular soap, Jassi Jaisi Koi Nahin, have not surged heavenwards after the all-brains-and-no-looks girl, Jassi, was given an image makeover. Not all her fans like her beautiful; some who still watch her saga ?can?t take her in a supermodel avatar?. Does this mean that the entertainers underestimated the maturity of the viewers, who valued brains and a ?good heart? above looks? Or their simplicity, by which they found comfort in equating brains and goodness with unthreatening plainness? Or maybe their satiation with glamour in the fantasy of everyday life that all TV channels promote so assiduously in their unending serials? It could be all this and more. What is clear is that the channel did not quite know what it was doing when it decided to ?process? Jassi?s ?inner beauty? into ?outer beauty?.

 There might have been an encouraging moral point in the rise of a strikingly plain girl who is actually brilliant and efficient. With the exclamatory subtitle ?Meritocracy in a sexist world? or something equally onerous, it could even have served as a slick example of an undeveloped mindset. The ingredients were all there. Brilliance and efficiency are not enough in an ugly girl, they are valueless without large doses of good-heartedness, or Jassi will have to be switched off during dinner with the family. Moral edification is part of her ?substance?, and awkwardness her ?identity?. In this world of broad strokes, there must be no doubt about her ?plainness?. So a grown woman must be endowed with incredible braces on her teeth (the contrast with the uproarious episode in which a lawyer is armed similarly to the teeth in Sex and the City could not be greater) and glasses that could break walls. Jassi is The Ugly Duckling: as long as she is not beautiful, she remains incomplete, never mind the brains. That was never the focus anyway. Women must be good ? and they must be beautiful. The story of Jassi is the wedding of the two.

 What fun for the beauty business it was. Jassi became a walking advertisement with beauty manufacturers maximizing space by using every square inch of her appearance to sell their respective brands of magic transformation. The entire exercise, true to the spirit of Jassi?s honesty, underlined the magnificent lie at the heart of advertising. Mona Singh, the actor who plays Jassi, was beautiful in the first place. It needed imagination, even if of the half-baked kind, to make her plain. The beauty manufacturers and Sony had a wonderfully lucrative time doing nothing. And the brainy girl is back, in a ?Look of the Year? role. Brains can wait till she loses her looks ? with age perhaps, or the whims of TV storytelling.

 Letters to Editor

 A lot to mend

 Sir ? It is heartening to find that after publishing endless paeans to Sourav Ganguly, The Telegraph has decided to look beyond petty provincialism and idolatry (?Wide ball?, Sept 28). But at the same time, it is utterly frustrating to realize that after all, nothing is going to make a difference. Has it not been proved time and again that Ganguly and his patrons can get away with anything? Under the circumstances, all criticism, however constructive they may be, expert or public opinion against Ganguly seem pointless. Nothing or nobody can touch Sourav Ganguly even if he has become a parasite of his own past: the outcome of the review committee?s meeting in Mumbai was a foregone conclusion. It is best not to pin our hopes on the 2007 World Cup.

 Yours faithfully,

Partha Chanda, Calcutta

 Sir ? Greg Chappell does not believe in ambiguities. He has been appointed as coach and as such, deserves complete freedom to work. If he found Sourav Ganguly mentally and physically unfit for inclusion in the Indian team, then the Board of Control for Cricket in India should have had faith in his decision. The review committee?s meeting was akin to a fixed match. What has happened in the last couple of weeks will ruin the prospect of the team in the upcoming tournaments as well the 2007 World Cup. For the sake of the team and the country, Ganguly should voluntarily step down.

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? The editorial, ?Wide ball? is a little unkind to Sourav Ganguly. One look at cricketing history will show that even the most solid batsmen have their lean patches. Mark Taylor, Steve Waugh, Brian Lara, David Gower, Michael Atherton, Sanath Jayasuriya have all struggled with the bat at some point of their careers. Most of them returned to form after a while, and Ganguly can too. He should not be written off so soon. It is good for him that the BCCI has sided with him in the spat with Greg Chappell. Yes, Ganguly will have to prove his worth in the coming two series against Sri Lanka and South Africa. If he fails, it will be wise for him to step down, before he is dropped from the side or asked to resign by the selectors.

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta 

 Sir ? For the first time since I started reading The Telegraph, I got a real chance to applaud its work. And that is for calling a spade a spade on the Ganguly versus Chappell issue. The Indian captain is a local boy, so I thought The Telegraph would refuse to see reason and back him blindly as most other Calcutta newspapers were doing. I am happy that ?Wide ball? has proved me wrong. 

 Yours faithfully,

R. Ramaswamy, Calcutta

 Sir ? I don?t agree with The Telegraph?s view that the compromise effected by BCCI between the captain and the coach is shoddy and meaningless. A holistic approach to the current scenario would show that no other solution was possible at the moment. Finding a replacement for Ganguly as captain at this juncture would have been a Herculean task. He must, of course, perform in the forthcoming series and be more flexible in his attitude. The coach, on the other hand, has to be less paranoid and try to earn faith and respect from the team.

 Yours faithfully,

A.K. Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir ? I endorse every word written in ?Wide ball?. It is sad, the shabby and ludicrous way that the six-member review committee worked on the serious episode of mud-slinging between the Team India coach and captain. The committee comprised BCCI administrators who know everything except cricket, and three cricket greats, Sunil Gavaskar, Ravi Shastri and S. Venkataraghavan. If the much-publicized review meeting was called to rubbish whatever Greg Chappell had said or had to say, and protect the spoilt brat-turned-godfather of Indian cricket, why make so much fuss? Greg Chappell has refused to be a puppet in the hands of the captain and cricket administrators. Is that a crime? It is time Indian cricket lovers refused to be taken for a ride.

 Yours faithfully,

Amitabha Bagchi, Calcutta

 Sir ? I was both surprised and disappointed to read the editorial, ?Wide ball?. The final comment, ?...the job of a talented coach has been severely circumscribed? is not backed by enough evidence. By what yardstick is Chappell declared to be a ?talented? coach? Does he have any past record to speak for him? Certainly not his record as coach of South Australia. He might have been a talented batsman, but it does not follow that he is a talented coach as well. It is also not true that the BCCI has ?chosen to ignore? Chappell?s email. The review committee has merely refused to accept what Chappell had to say as the whole truth. There may be various reasons for an Australian to harbour malice against Ganguly. But it is hard to imagine that an Indian newspaper can be so critical of our best captain ever. 

 Yours faithfully,

Anupam Dawn, Asansol

 Sir ? It speaks volumes of The Telegraph?s unbiased approach to news that its edit and sports pages are allowed to express diametrically opposite views on the same issue. Lokendra Pratap Sahi?s reports are shamelessly tilted in favour of the Indian captain, but then, objectivity has never been his strong point. ?Wide ball? gave a far more balanced view.

 Yours faithfully,

Ashoke P. Mahtani, Calcutta

 CAST ABOUT

 To lay bare in one stroke all the joints that creak within the anomalies and suppressions inherent in India?s culture and polity, it needed only one case. The case culminated in the setting aside of the 1999 election of Ms Sobha Hymvathi Devi, from a constituency reserved for scheduled tribes in Andhra Pradesh, by a high court judgment upheld by the Supreme Court. The judgment stated that the father?s caste decides the offspring?s. The elected representative, born of a higher-caste father and a tribal mother, should not be occupying an ST reserved seat. It is no surprise that a logic that accepts caste as a marker of identity would associate it with directly and solely with paternity. The logic is generated by a society arranged on the principle that women have no caste, presumably as cattle do not. It may seem surprising that a judiciary, which has distinguished itself by its sensitive interpretation of the law in order to give women their rightful place and has passed judgments that establish precedents for the protection of their rights and dignity, should accommodate this other kind of logic. But the law must function within a polity in which reservations on the basis of caste, one of the most divisive features of Indian society, have become one of the chief means of winning elections. In this case, to add an extra twist, the rival who managed to discredit Ms Sobha Devi?s claim to the chair is a man.

 To some extent the joke is on the establishment, even though the defendant has lost. The fact remains that her parents were not married ? she was the fruit of an ?illicit? relationship. The case is most fascinating here. What happens in a patriarchal system of identity when there is no ?licit? paternity? The consideration that the mother brought up the girl in her own community may not be pertinent here, but certain questions remain unanswered. These relate to choices that have to be made ? how far will official labelling go in order to impose a concealed but official system of identity? At what point does illicit change into licit? Who determines the point of change and the categories on both sides? The court and the polity could also have been dealing with a clash of values and sexual mores, where what is perfectly normal in one society is illicit in another. Ironically, this makes the case even more relevant to a rapidly changing society where live-in relationships are likely to become more common.

 MAKE WAY

 Those who want to change things should know what they are up against. Some of his comrades seem to be Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s worst enemies. They are the ones who still question his single-minded commitment to usher in a new phase of industrialization in West Bengal. They represent the Marxist old guard whose obstructionist policies and practices were largely responsible for the state?s industrial decline. Such is their resistance to change that they view the chief minister?s pro-industry initiative with deep suspicion. It is some comfort that Mr Bhattacharjee is aware of the spoilers within his own party. Even more heartening should be his promise that he will not shy away from the fight within. What he said at a programme of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) should reassure investors of his sincerity to push aside all obstacles to the state?s re-industrialization. This is not the first time he has said so. But, given the history of the CPI(M)?s opposition to economic modernization, it is perhaps necessary for the chief minister to periodically reiterate his position. His latest statement is also timely in view of the CPI(M)?s forthcoming conference at which his pro-change policies might face another bout of criticism from unreformed colleagues. 

 But, as far as the investors in Bengal are concerned, it would be more a test for the chief minister than for his party. He not only has to join the fight against militant trade unionists and others within the party but also win it. It would not do for him to blame the party?s labour wing, the Centre of Indian Trade Unions, for any resistance to his attempts to modernize Bengal?s economy. Mr Bhattacharjee alone would have to take the blame for any failure on this count. The chief minister has no option but to win the party?s confidence in what he is trying to achieve. He has rightly suggested that new industries alone could rapidly create the employment opportunities that the state needs so desperately. Everyone agrees that modern industries and commercialized agriculture are the two pillars on which the state?s new economy has to be built. The new agriculture policy of Mr Bhattacharjee?s government has initiated change in the farm sector as well. A spate of new industrial investments would suggest that he has been able to create a new hope for Bengal. He cannot afford to let quibbling comrades destroy that hope.

 Letters to Editor

 Still in the dark

 Sir ? New Delhi reacted in the right spirit. Allowing the blasts to dampen the Diwali spirit would have signalled the victory of those who have nothing but contempt for human lives. The attack of the little-known outfit, the Islamic Inquilabi Mahaz, which has claimed responsibility, was intended to have an impact on the psyche of the people of this country. If this leads to a strong public opinion against any peace deal with Pakistan, it will be difficult to preserve the composite dialogue process. No government can dare to go against the wishes of the people. It is true that only terrorists and their sympathizers will be happy if the India-Pakistan peace drive comes to a halt.

 Yours faithfully,

J. Akshobhya, Mysore

 Sir ? October was perhaps one of the cruellest months of the year. First millions perished in the earthquake, then came the train accident and the bomb blasts that killed and maimed hundreds. Despite all this, I was pained to see people celebrating Diwali with gusto all over the country, and even in Delhi, where the relatives of those killed were fighting over the mortal remains of their dear ones. How can we be so heartless? 

 Yours faithfully, 

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 Sir ? The blasts in the busiest market places on Saturday evening were carried out to do maximum harm to the commonest of people. But the people of Delhi retaliated the very next day by going about their daily chores without fear. This type of reaction was unexpected even a few years earlier. People have now begun to realize that terrorism is a nuisance. Delhiites have probably learnt from Mumbaikars, who were not the least perturbed by blasts which shook their city at regular intervals for months.

 Yours faithfully,

Sudip Sen, Dhenkanal

 Sir ? The Diwali carnage in New Delhi exposes a serious lapse on the part of the security establishment, more so because there were, reportedly, indications of such a terrorist strike this time. There is hardly any point in condemning such acts after the event and calling the terrorists names. The establishment has to find ways and means to stop the menace. It seems that the withdrawal of the draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act has started to backfire as it has not been replaced by any other special anti-terror act. The home minister?s repeated assurance that the available laws are sufficient to handle terrorism is unconvincing. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir ? Saturday?s blasts in Delhi are a grim reminder that terrorism can strike any part of the world anytime. The blasts have once again demonstrated how vulnerable the common man is. An open democratic society will always be susceptible to such attacks. It is time we inculcated a security culture similar to what exists in Israel, where the government regularly conducts drills and educates people on what is to be done in the event of a terror attack. Simulations of various types of attacks, such as bomb blasts in crowded places, hijacking and other conceivable scenarios, will go a long way in minimizing the shock effect. 

 Yours faithfully,

Suman Barthakur, Guwahati

 Sir ? We now know who were the perpetrators of the blasts and also the fact that they have links with Pakistan. And yet our government keeps on talking optimistically about improving relations with Pakistan. Indians have been insulted, humiliated and dwarfed in front of Pakistan. The United Progressive Alliance government has brought shame and disgrace to this country and failed to perform its basic duties.

 Yours faithfully,

S.P. Sharma, Mumbai

 Sir ? The outrage over the New Delhi blasts is quite natural. And the call for tracking down the culprits is justified. But to end up rooting for the usual suspects ? al Qaida and Lashkar-e-Toiba ? would be jumping to conclusions. Let us not make the same mistake as the Americans did. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sushant, Calcutta

 Sir ? The explanations given by the prime minister?s media cell about his inability to address the nation immediately after the bomb blasts are amateurish (?Protocol belt around PM?, Oct 31). By 6.30 pm that day, everyone in India came to know about the situation, except Sanjaya Baru who says he received the message as the plane took off from Agartala. It also appears strange that Baru did not receive any further calls on his mobile from Delhi. It was a serious lapse if the fax machine on the plane was not working or New Delhi did not inform the pilot or the pilot did not pass on the information. It is flabbergasting that Manmohan Singh got the details exactly two hours later at Calcutta. What will happen in case there is a nuclear attack on India? In any case, there could have been an impromptu speech from the Calcutta airport itself, telecast live with the help of Doordarshan?s support van. 

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Delhi police and Delhi fire service should be congratulated for their commendable job on October 29. Their alertness helped defuse another bomb in Chandni Chowk and prevented a still bigger tragedy. 

 Yours faithfully,

Subhash C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

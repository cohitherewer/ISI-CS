 FRIENDS IN NEED

 Occasions like a Saarc meet always produce their full quota of pious statements. Mr Manmohan Singh tacitly admitted this when he said that ?people do make statements directed at special audiences?. Yet between the lines of joint declarations of intent are tucked in the real problems that affect the countries of the subcontinent. The most serious of these is the phenomenon of terrorism which occupies the top place in the Dhaka declaration that followed the last day of the 13th Saarc summit. Mr Singh expressed India?s concern about Pakistan?s failure to honour its commitment, articulated in the January 2004 Islamabad joint statement that territory under its control would not be used for terrorist activity directed against India. The issue of some Indian militants using Bangladesh as a haven and even as a training ground was not left out of the discussions between Mr Singh and Begum Khaleda Zia, the prime minister of Bangladesh. Despite these anxieties voiced by India, there was the promise of greater cooperation between the Saarc countries. The summit concluded on a note of optimism, especially as the member nations agreed to give the South Asian Free Trade Area the green signal by January 2006.

 All previous meetings of Saarc have been stalked by a suspicion of the smaller nations of India. The suspicion is grounded in fears relating to India?s size and is manifest in the tendency of the smaller states to unite and scupper what is perceived by them to be India?s agenda of dominating the region. Despite the mood of optimism and the promise of greater cooperation, the just-concluded meeting was not entirely free of suspicion. There was the suggestion put forward by Nepal that China should be brought in as an observer. This proposal may even have had the covert support of Pakistan. India parried the thrust by saying that Japan could also be given a similar invitation. Mr Shaukat Aziz, the prime minister of Pakistan, spoke of a ?trust deficit?? between India and Pakistan which Mr Singh countered by expressing the hope that the deficit would become a surplus. These are examples of the way suspicion is obstructing the emergence of a genuine spirit of regional cooperation. This also explains why Saarc remains a laggard in comparison to the Asean. Some progress has been made over 13 meetings but there is nothing yet to create excitement.

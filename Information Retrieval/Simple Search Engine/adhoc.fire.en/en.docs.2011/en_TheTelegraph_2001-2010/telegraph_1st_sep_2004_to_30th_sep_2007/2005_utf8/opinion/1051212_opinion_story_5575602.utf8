 Letters to Editor

 Laws that bind

 Sir ? The ?Dos and Don?ts at Pushkar? (Dec 2) tarnish the image of the beautiful land of Rajasthan. The initiative of introducing a set of guidelines for the town which holds one of the most famous fairs in the country is welcome, but forbidding men to touch women in public, even if it is only to help them out of a bus or car is ludicrous. With a bar on the basic courtesy practiced in the West, the government is trying to send a wrong message to the tourist. A ban on kissing and hugging in public, or walking nude is not surprising, given that the country in question is India. By issuing such guidelines, the government is only harming the tourism industry. If foreign tourists are made to abide by these silly rules, they will surely go back disgruntled and narrate the horrifying tale to their friends and family back home. And word of mouth is of great importance in the tourism industry. The government would be well-advised to take the opinion of tour operators, foreign embassy personnel, and local community leaders before framing such guidelines. The feedback from these groups will help the government agencies formulate guidelines which will be more widely acceptable.

 Yours faithfully,

Bipasha Lahiri, Hyderabad

 Sir ? India is a country where 15th century and 21st century ideals can coexist without sparks flying. Indians admire Meena Kumari and Mallika Sherawat alike. It is those who take on the role of culture police, and not ordinary citizens, who come up with such things as a booklet to teach moral behaviour to foreign tourists visiting Pushkar. Few countries of the world can compete with India on double standards. Ancient Hindu temples, like those in Khajuraho and Konarak, have murals showing sexual positions. The phallus of Shiva is one of the most popular objects of Hindu worship. The self-professed moral and culture police are a big reason why India has the second largest number of HIV-positive people in the world .

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? It is good that the Rajasthan government has brought out a booklet informing the large numbers of foreign tourists who visit Pushkar every year about the culture and tradition of the land. Visitors from more liberal cultures need to be forewarned about what is acceptable to the largely rural population of the region. 

 Yours faithfully,

Salil Gewali, Shillong

 Hope floats

 Sir ? These are truly exciting times for West Bengal (?Wage-dues hump on Dunlop revival road?). The era of militant trade-unionism seems to be over, finally. Two events reinforce this belief. First, the state-owned Great Eastern Hotel has been successfully privatized, without too many roadblocks created by the trade unions. Second, the Dunlop factory opened under a new ownership, with the trade unions again playing a positive role. And then there is talk about a corridor to Singapore which will not just put Calcutta in a leadership position within India, but transform the city into a truly international gateway. The way Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is handling affairs, it seems that those who are not investing in Bengal now will end up on the losing side. P.K. Ruia and Lalit Suri, of Dunlop and Great Eastern respectively, will not be among them.

 Yours faithfully

Anand Gupta, Hampton, UK

 Sir ? The heritage property of Great Eastern Hotel in Calcutta has changed hands and gone into the fold of the group of hotels owned by Lalit Suri. Considering the rich history of the hotel, it would be desirable if the character of the hotel is retained to give its guests a flavour of Calcutta?s glorious past. Something like what has been done to the Raffles Hotel in Singapore could be attempted here, making the restored heritage property a major tourist attraction. Among other traditions that it maintains, at the Raffles Bar you can still peel the salted groundnuts and leave the shells on the bar to be swept by the bartender at regular intervals onto the floor where the crunch under your feet give you that heady feeling of having taken a drink too many. Couldn?t an industrial group from Calcutta, which has some idea of the city, taken over Great Eastern, rather than an outsider?

 Yours faithfully,

S. Kamat, Alto Porvorim, Goa

 Sir ? The West Bengal government must be congratulated for the successful privatization of the Great Eastern Hotel. For many years, the taxpayers? money was being wasted in running this hotel. The government should now take steps to disinvest the other government undertakings in the state. It is not a government?s job to directly run industries.

 Yours sincerely,

Abhijit Guha, Mississauga, Canada

 SANITIZE THE GOODS IN VESSELS

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the WHO?s revised international health regulations, adopted at the World Health Assembly, May 16, 2005

 Article 32: In implementing health measures under these Regulations, State Parties shall treat travellers with respect for their dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms and minimize any discomfort or distress associated with such measures, including by: (a) treating all travellers with courtesy and respect; (b) taking into consideration the gender, socio-cultural, ethnic or religious concerns of travellers; and (c) providing or arranging for adequate food and water, appropriate accommodation and clothing, protection for baggage and other possessions, appropriate medical treatment, means of necessary communication if possible in a language that they can understand, and other appropriate assistance for travellers who are quarantined, isolated or subject to medical examinations or other procedures for public health purposes. 

 Article 33: Goods in transit without trans-shipment shall not be subject to health measures under these Regulations or detained for public health purposes. 

 Article 34: State Parties shall ensure that container shippers use international traffic containers that are kept free...of infection or contamination... 

 Whenever, in the opinion of a State Party, the volume of international container traffic is sufficiently large, the competent authorities shall take all practicable measures consistent with these Regulations, including carrying out inspections, to assess the sanitary condition of container loading areas and containers in order to ensure that the obligations contained in these Regulations are implemented. Facilities for the inspection and isolation of containers shall be available at container loading areas. Container consignees and consignors shall make every effort to avoid cross-contamination when multiple-use loading of containers is employed. 

 Article 35: No health documents, other than those provided for under these Regulations or in recommendations issued by WHO, shall be required in international traffic, provided however that this Article shall not apply to travellers seeking temporary or permanent residence, nor shall it apply to document requirements concerning the public health status of goods in international trade pursuant to applicable international agreements. 

 Article 36 : A traveller in possession of a certificate of vaccination or other prophylaxis issued in conformity with Annex 6 and, when applicable, Annex 7, shall not be denied entry as a consequence of the disease to which the certificate refers, even if coming from an affected area, unless the competent authority has verifiable indications and/or evidence that the vaccination or other prophylaxis was not effective. 

 Article 37: The master of a ship, before arrival at its first port of call in the territory of a State Party, shall ascertain the state of health on board, and, except when that State Party does not require it, the master shall, on arrival, or in advance of the vessel?s arrival if the vessel is so equipped and the State Party requires such advance delivery, complete and deliver to the competent authority for that port a Maritime Declaration of Health which shall be countersigned by the ship?s surgeon...The master or the ship?s surgeon shall supply any information required by the authority as to health conditions on board during an international voyage.

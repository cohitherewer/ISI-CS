 BASICALLY WRONG

 Backwardness is sometimes the result of daftness in the high places. This was recently the case in Uttar Pradesh ? India?s largest state, with a population of 170 million ? famous for its problems of illiteracy as well as caste and gender injustice, usually explained in economic and demographic terms. UP?s ?basic education? minister has summarily vetoed sex education in schools. He was responding to a Central committee recommendation, which, in turn, was mediating to the states ? education being a concurrent subject ? the proposals of the national curriculum framework review committee. The UP minister?s reasons for resisting sex education in schools take on interesting local colours. He has said that the idea of introducing such a subject emanates from the air-conditioned drawing rooms of ?upper-caste intellectuals?; it would only promote ?obscenity and crime?, and would undermine the state?s distinctive ?culture?. It was also evident that for this minister, sex education meant simply instructions on the use of condoms.

 In a state whose population has grown by 34.1 million in a decade, and where violent caste oppression, rape, abysmal standards of public education, health (polio and HIV/AIDS, for instance) and other basic services remain crippling problems, this sort of ignorant nonchalance, backed by state power, is dangerous, to say the least. Not only a lack, but also the corruption of political will has taken on almost irreversibly pernicious forms in states like Bihar and UP. Like everything else, the HIV/AIDS scenario remains alarming and largely unmapped in such a state, and rigidly feudal structures determine the relations between the sexes. The minister?s ignorance and arbitrariness also prove that this is not simply a rural backwardness, born of extreme disempowerment, but a pervasive conservatism that engulfs the society. The Indian bureaucracy, with its numerous Central and review committees, makes implementation difficult in any case. Powerfully wrong-headed ignorance makes the situation even more hopeless.

 OVER BOARD

 A good move is often spoilt by bad faith. This seems to be the case with the West Bengal government?s proposed legislation on pre-litigation conciliation boards. It should have been widely accepted as a welcome move to help the poor people in the villages get speedy and inexpensive justice. Given the fact that long-running cases have become the norm in courts across the country, it makes eminent sense to try an alternative system of resolving disputes. Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee should thus be happy that the Union law minister, Mr H.R. Bhardwaj, has stood by West Bengal?s proposed law. It is another matter that even Mr Bhardwaj?s support may not be enough for the chief minister to silence critics of the shalishi bill, as it is known. It is an important move with far-reaching consequences for the judicial system. Mr Bhattacharjee is right to prefer a consensus with political parties and the lawyers opposing it before his government proposes the bill in the state assembly. Some of these opponents may have their own, rather than the people?s, interests in trying to stall the legislation. But Mr Bhattacharjee needs to convince different shades of opinion that the government?s intention is aboveboard. 

 There is a lurking suspicion, and not just among his political opponents, that the village conciliation boards could be reduced to playthings in the hands of local politicians. And the worst suspects are the panchayat functionaries of Mr Bhattacharjee?s own party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist). There have been numerous instances when the party?s word has become law in Bengal?s villages. If the party?s shadow were to fall on the shalishi boards, it could mean worse than just a travesty of justice. The scepticism over the bill is thus partly the result of the CPI(M)?s oligarchic reign in Bengal?s villages. True, the bill gives a villager the right to appeal to a court if he is dissatisfied with the village board?s verdict. But an oppressive party will have many ways to stop such a litigant. The need is to devise a system that will keep the boards free from political interference. It may not be easy to find a sufficient number of legal professionals to work on the boards. It may be possible, though, to make the boards accountable in other ways. Above all, the entire exercise could be futile if the boards themselves got involved in unnecessary litigation.

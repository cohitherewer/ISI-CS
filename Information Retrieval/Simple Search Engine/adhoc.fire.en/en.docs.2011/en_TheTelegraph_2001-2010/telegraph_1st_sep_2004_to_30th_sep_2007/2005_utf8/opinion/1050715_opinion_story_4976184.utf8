 Letters to Editor

 In praise of the rulers

 Sir ? Our prime minister, Manmohan Singh, is an honest and upright man (?English gift to giver Oxford?, July). When he praised British rule over India, he was only telling the truth and giving the devil his due. There is no need for the Bharatiya Janata Party to take umbrage over it. It is sad that the quality of governance has deteriorated since independence. The recent report on corruption in the government, brought out by Transparency International, tells it all.

 Yours faithfully,

C.V.K. Moorthy, Calcutta

 Sir ? Manmohan Singh?s recent comment that the English language is a part of Indian culture and has become another common language amongst Indians should not be dismissed out of hand. His comment gives a clear signal to states like Tamil Nadu and Assam, where there is a demand for the exclusive use of the local language in state government offices, to adopt English as well. In fact, the first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, had advocated a twin-language policy for all states. In a country where people float from one state to another for jobs or studies, the twin-language policy needs to be given some thought.

 Yours faithfully,

R. Sekar, Angul

 Sir ? The prime minister?s praise for the British administration is shocking. The country needs honest people to rule the nation, and there is no doubt that Manmohan Singh is one such rare personality. But comments like this could land him in trouble. Do honours and awards induce even the most sensible people to say things without thinking about the consequences? Singh?s paean to British rule is misplaced. Our Constitution borrows largely from British rules governing India. As a result, we have a dictatorial judiciary which is not accountable to anyone. And what we have in the name of multi- party democracy is nothing but ?mobocracy?. 

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir ? Manmohan Singh, who is only the de jure prime minister of the country ? the de facto one being Sonia Gandhi ? has eulogized British rule in India. But if the British, who partitioned India by making clever use of the ambitions of Jinnah and Nehru, were so good to us, what was the necessity of the Non-Cooperation and Quit India movements? Why did freedom fighters sacrifice their lives? Why was the Partition necessary? The people would have allowed the British to continue had they been happy under their rule.

 Yours faithfully,

K.G. Acharya, Mumbai

 Chariot of ire

 Sir ? Congratulations to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and the new mayor, Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya, for taking the Calcutta Municipal Corporation to task for going on a ?tree-cutting spree? at the behest of a group which organizes an annual rathyatra. As a tree was being senselessly felled outside my house on Park Street, I took the initiative to ask where the order had come from, only to be told dismissively by the men that they were representatives of the CMC and were just doing their job. Ironically, there is a CMC signboard nearby which urges citizens to keep Calcutta Green.

 With the approaching pujas, the mayor-in-council (parks and gardens) needs to be more vigilant to see that such mindless cutting of trees is not repeated to make space for pandals. Perhaps there should be a stringent and enforceable law to deter people from wantonly cutting down trees within the Calcutta municipal precincts without cause or authority.

 Yours faithfully,

Tina Mehta, Calcutta

 Sir ? It was good to hear Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee expressing concern for the lopping off of big branches in the Park Street area to grant an easier passage to the International Society for Krishna Consciousness rath. Many undesirable and destructive actions are often sanctioned in the name of religion. The authorities should be extra cautious before the pujas and Muharram. 

 Environmentalists have been protesting in vain for some time now against the failure of the Hooghly Bridge Commissioners to replace the trees cut down during the construction of the Gariahat and A.J.C. Bose Road flyovers. If these cases went to court, it would increase the burden on the judiciary. But then judicial action should not be necessary as most of these cases are within the ambit of administrative jurisdiction.

 Yours faithfully,

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? Was it not possible for the Iskcon chariots to enjoy a smooth ride without the pruning of the surrounding trees? Cutting down trees is certainly not a part of the Krishna consciousness that Iskcon seeks to preach. The chariots should have been diverted so that the trees could remain intact. True, this is easier said than done, given the huge number of devotees thronging the chariots. But Iskcon volunteers and the policemen should have acted more responsibly.

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

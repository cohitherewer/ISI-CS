 Puff, puff, they all fall down 

 Political correctness should not come in the way of enjoying SMOKE 

 (Reaktion, ?29) edited by Sander L. Gilman and Zhou 

 Xun. Since people everywhere, and in all ages, have smoked, 

 a book that describes and enumerates the various practices, 

 rituals and paraphernalia surrounding it is important, if 

 only for its sociological value. But what will delight the 

 reader are the illustrations. The little man smoking the gigantic 

 cigar (bottom right) is the artist?s representation of how 

 much tobacco a smoker consumes in 50 years. If the model smoking 

 in a studio (c. 1900) embodies turn-of-the-century 

 bohemianism, then the pregnant lady wearing a dress called 

 A Packet a Week (2002) addresses the militant health 

 consciousness of the fin de next si?cle. Sadly, 

 we seem to have lost the natural insouciance of the duo (left 

 centre), puffing merrily perched on a couch (but why do they 

 have to sit on the bolsters?).

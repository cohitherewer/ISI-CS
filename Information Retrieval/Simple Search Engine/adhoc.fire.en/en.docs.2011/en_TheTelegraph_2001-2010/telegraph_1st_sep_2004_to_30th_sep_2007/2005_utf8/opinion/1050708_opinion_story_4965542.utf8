 Paperback Pickings

 When the beloved slurps

 Colossus: the rise and fall of the American Empire (Penguin, ?6.30) by Niall Ferguson has lines from Milton?s Samson Agonistes as one of its epigraphs: ?...to me strength is my bane,/ And proves the source of all my miseries.? Ferguson set out to write this book in the belief that ?the role of the US in the world today could be better understood by comparing it with past empires?. The book treats ?imperial denial? as an American national condition: ?It is...acceptable among American liberals to say that the United States is an empire provided that you deplore the fact.? The book then goes on to show how ?the American empire, in so far as it continues to exist, will remain a somewhat dysfunctional entity?. The last words are dramatic: ?The question Americans must ask themselves is just how transient they wish their predominance to be. Though the barbarians have already knocked at the gates ? once, spectacularly ? imperial decline in this case seems more likely to come, as it came to Gibbon?s Rome, from within.?

 Confronting love (Penguin, Rs 125) edited by Jerry Pinto and Arundhathi Subramaniam is a slim collection of contemporary Indo-Anglian love poems. It talks of the thrill, as well as the mill, of love ? as Cole Porter would have said. There is old love, new love, love that?s fresh and still unspoiled, and love that?s only slightly soiled. There is, incredibly, even a bit of true love thrown in for good measure. There is Vikram Seth and Ruth Vanita, A.K. Ramanujan and Kynpham Sing Nongkynrih. Here?s Seth?s ?Prandial Plaint?: ?My love, I love your breasts. I love your nose./ I love your accent and I love your toes./ I am your slave. One word, and I obey./ But please don?t slurp your coffee in that way.?

 When banshee kissed bimbo and other stories (Puffin, Rs 199) by Ranjit Lal is a wonderful collection of slightly naughty ?bird stories?, with just the right mix of innocent fun and irreverence, written in a light and lyrical prose. These are stories about the friendships, feuds and family intrigues among the birds of Goa. Lal swears that ?these stories are all based on hard facts and so could actually have happened?. There is, among others, Mad Mozart, the magpie robin maestro, and Shakespeare, the ?tall, regal Alexandrine parakeet who can speak Englaish but doesn?t understand a word of it?.

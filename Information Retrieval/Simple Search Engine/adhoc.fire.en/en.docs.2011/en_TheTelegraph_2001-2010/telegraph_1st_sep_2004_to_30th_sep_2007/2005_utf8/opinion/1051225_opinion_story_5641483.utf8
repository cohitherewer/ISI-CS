 RETURN OF THE NATIVE

 The happiness and relief at the inclusion of Sourav Ganguly in the team for Pakistan should be tempered by certain considerations. The inclusion cannot be separated from what happened when he was dropped for the Ahmedabad test. After his omission, politicians, including the redoubtable chief minister of West Bengal, Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, raised a hue and cry within parliament and outside it. The president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, Mr Sharad Pawar, took the unprecedented and unwarranted step of meeting Ganguly. While no official statement was issued about what transpired in camera between the two, it would be na?ve to assume that Ganguly?s omission was not discussed, and that the board president and the former captain discussed the state of play while sipping a cuppa. The meeting conveyed the distinct impression that Mr Pawar was succumbing to regionalism, and was exerting pressure on the selection committee. Ganguly?s inclusion in the touring party cannot be freed from this context and thus leaves a bad taste in the mouth.

 Another decision will also make cricket-lovers in India very uncomfortable. It has been announced that a member of the national selection committee will accompany the touring party. What will be his role? There can be only one answer to this question, whatever be the official version. He will be part of the committee which will select the teams for the test matches and the one-day internationals. This is an unprecedented move. Normally, the captain, the vice-captain and the coach select the side when on tour. Sometimes, a senior player is co-opted. The presence of a national selector suggests a certain amount of mistrust in the wisdom and judgment of those who will form the selection committee during the tour. Perhaps this is what Mr Pawar meant when he had declared, during the clamour over Ganguly?s omission, that he would ensure that justice is done. It is not difficult to figure out who is the target of this mistrust. The BCCI is in the paradoxical situation of having hired a coach whose judgment it cannot trust, and to whom it is unwilling to give absolute responsibility. In this sense, the entire episode smacks of a retreat from professionalism.

 The dropping of Ganguly for the Ahmedabad test and his inclusion in the touring side are decisions that pull in opposite directions. If there was no place for Ganguly in the Ahmedabad test side, there is no place for him in the side to play in Pakistan since Ganguly has not done anything in between. Under the circumstances, two questions immediately arise. Is he travelling as a passenger? Or is his inclusion related to non-cricketing reasons? An affirmative answer to either question does Ganguly and Indian cricket no good.

 Letters to Editor

 Red in the face 

 Sir ? The editorial, ?General line? (April 15), crushed whatever hope Ashis Chakrabarti?s ?Turning a new page in the red book? held out for the leftists. Chakrabarti, despite making no bones of the fact that now the politburo will ride roughshod over the state units, merely enumerated the changes Prakash Karat would try to push through without going into their likely effects on the party?s future. The editorial showed no such mercy. There is just one contradiction both failed to touch on. With Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at the head of the party?s strongest bastion, and Prakash Karat at the helm of the party nationally, the communists today can boast of the youngest leadership in the nation. And yet, it seems to have taken a turn more regressive than any chintan baithak of squabbling saffron septuagenarians ever managed.

 Yours faithfully,

M.C. Jain, Calcutta

 On a smoother plane

 Sir ? Sino-Indian relations seem to have taken off with such a gusto that now the two countries are cooperating in so far uncharted territories like films (?Beijing beckons Bollywood?, April 12). The exotic Chinese locale ? mountain ranges and intermontane plateaus, the Takla Makan desert with the snow-capped Tien-Shan range ? can be the ideal setting for Bollywood songs and thriller climaxes. More importantly, the people of the two countries can know each other better by watching each other?s movies. Understanding the culture of foreign countries is the key to maintaining friendly relations at the international level. Whatever diplomats do at the administrative level does not always touch the lives of the common people. Cultural intercourse through movies, which always have a wide appeal, can accelerate better relations among the people of both the countries which have a long history and a diverse cultural heritage. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Sir ? Why is the Bangalore police so apologetic about the incident on April 10, when a Tibetan refugee was found atop a tower of the Indian Institute of Science, demonstrating against the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, who was then visiting the institute (?Asian century knocks?, April 11)? For one, this is not the first time that the Chinese prime minister is witnessing Tibetan dissidence. Second, India is the second biggest democracy in the world and, unlike China, is not in the habit of vanquishing peaceful protests. For visiting Chinese dignitaries, it is most natural to come across anti-China demonstrations in India, which has given refuge to the dalai lama and thousands of his followers. Instead of regarding the Tibetan?s demonstration as a breach of security, the government should acknowledge it as a sign of India?s working demo- cracy.

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, 

 Jamshedpur

 Sir ? China?s, and increasingly India?s, attitude towards the boundary issue would be to shelve it in favour of trade. The agreement over Sikkim shows that there has already been a change in attitude. However, one should remember that the problems over Arunachal and northern Kashmir or the Tibet-Xinjiang highway, which cuts through Indian territory near Aksai Chin, are far from over. 

 China was looking for certain definite objectives from this visit ? India?s support for the recent anti-secession law against Taiwan; sidelining the border disputes in Kashmir and Aksai Chin but trying to change the Indian position over Arunachal, which would greatly boost its manufacturing exports; preventing India from going over to the American camp and joining any future Asian Nato; attracting considerable investment from Indian MNCs. India, in turn, was primarily hoping to get some sort of a positive vibe from Beijing about its inclusion in the security council, apart from solving some of the border disputes. Both the nations have managed to get one or more of their objectives fulfilled. What is most encouraging is that both have agreed to give a massive boost to bilateral trade which will open up new horizons.

 Yours faithfully,

Aruni Mukherjee, Warwick, UK 

 Sir ? It is praiseworthy that the Indian and Chinese governments have sorted out the dispute over Sikkim and agreed to work towards solving the border disputes over Arunachal Pradesh and Aksai Chin. However, the new thrust in Hindi-Chini bhai bhaiism can only last if the Chinese government follows the guidelines the countries have agreed upon.

 Yours faithfully,

Md. Mudassir Alam, Aligarh

 Sir ? The path-breaking agreement signed between India and China, setting out the political parameters and guiding principles to settle border disputes, proves that India?s problems with China is more legal in nature while those with Pakistan are more political. 

 Yours faithfully,

Hem Raj Jain, Bangalore

 Sir ? That Bangalore was part of Wen Jiabao?s itinerary shows China?s admission of Indian software supremacy (?Wen stirs tech hopes?, April 10). Given the two nations? military strength, stable and surging economic growth, a collaboration in the IT sector would do them a world of good. However even here, India has to be both aggressive and cautious. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sayantan Das, Konnagar

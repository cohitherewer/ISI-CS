 FREEDOM AT A PRICE

 Conspiracy theorist

Iraq, Afghanistan and The imperialism of our time 

By Aijaz Ahmad, 

LeftWord, Rs 450

Aijaz Ahmad, is a man of many parts. The visiting 

professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University is also an editorial consultant with 

Frontline, a leading Marxist thinker and a critic. His book consists of 

12 articles and an essay on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. 

 Ahmad argues that the war against Iraq was pre-ordained and had very little to do with thwarting terrorism or destroying weapons of mass destruction. The real motive of the war was to give the United States of America an access to Iraq?s oil reserves and gain a foothold in the region. 

 However, Ahmad?s reasoning is similar to the contentious arguments presented by Marxist theorists of the past. He writes that America ?can never defeat terrorism with a global reach because for all its barbarity and irrationality...terrorism is also a...response to the much greater cruelties of imperialism itself. The only way to end ?terrorism? is to rebuild a revolutionary movement of the left whose place it occupies and with whose mantle it masquerades?. But Ahmad?s arguments are far from perfect. If the US did not effectively capture Afghanistan or cripple the global terrorist network severely, the world?s only superpower would be guilty of not protecting its population from the threat of rabid jehadis like Osama bin Laden. Reneging on its promise to continue the war against terror goes against the American promise of democratizing the world. Also, conspicuous in its absence is Ahmad?s views on the recent terrorist attacks in India, Bali, Spain and so on. Moreover, Ahmad?s theory that terrorists are ?poor or wretched victims of imperialism? is far from the truth. Osama bin Laden, the most famous face of global terror, happens to be a disgruntled, rich, bourgeois. In all probability, Ahmad represents a dying breed of Marxists who envisage a better future under Communism even after the fall of the red empire all over the world.

 The aim of American foreign policy since the First World War has been threefold, says the author; destruction of Communism, defeating Third World nationalism and eradicating competition in the capitalist world. What Ahmad does not mention here is that the erstwhile Soviet Union, too, is guilty of destroying capitalism, planting puppet regimes in the Third World and protecting its hegemony in the Communist bloc, especially East Europe.

 A considerable part of Ahmad?s book deals with the relevance of the Bolshevik revolution and the ill-effects of fascism. But Ahmad has not used Ramsay Clark?s report to the UN security council on Iraq to strengthen his arguments. Clark?s report depicts the suffering of Iraq after the imposition of sanctions that followed the first Gulf war. 

 In his report, Clark depicts a grim picture about post-war Iraq. He writes, ?The annual number of deaths of children under age five grew more than tenfold from 1989 to 1999. Members of the population with serious chronic illnesses requiring regular medication, or therapy, suffer the highest percentages of death...approaching 100 per cent for some illnesses where survival rates were as high as 95 per cent before sanctions. Oil production for even the very low levels, was less than a third of the pre-sanction level, and could not be maintained because of deteriorated and destroyed facilities and lack of equipment and parts. The sanctions target to kill, or injure infants, children, the elderly and the chronically ill?. He then proceeds to argue that the sanctions violated the Genocide Convention of 1948 which forbids acts committed with the intent of destroying, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group.

 Had Ahmad used this particular document, his allegations that the American invasion of Iraq on flimsy grounds was a mere excuse to capture Iraqi oil and that it was George W. Bush who came up with this idea to go one up on his father might have sounded more credible. Without it though, The Imperialism Of Our Time promises much initially but fails to deliver anything substantial in the end.

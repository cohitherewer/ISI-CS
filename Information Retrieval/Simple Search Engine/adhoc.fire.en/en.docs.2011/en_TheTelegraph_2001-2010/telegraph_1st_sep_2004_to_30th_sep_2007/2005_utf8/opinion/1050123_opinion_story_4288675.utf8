 MAPPING CANCER 

 - Aizawl has highest incidence of stomach cancer after Japan

 After four years of trying to track down malignancies, the government is ready with a cancer atlas highlighting patterns observed never before in India. G.S. Mudur reports

 The first connections between home addresses and cancers in India have surfaced. A woman who?s lived long enough in New Delhi has the best chance in the world to get gall bladder cancer. A man in Aizawl, Mizoram, is twice as likely to get stomach cancer as a man in Bangalore. And northeast Tamil Nadu shares something with Kyadondo county in Uganda: the highest rates of penile cancer in the world. Suddenly, it looks like the world?s cancer ?hotspots? lie in India. 

 Four years after launching India?s biggest effort to map malignancies, the government is about to unveil an Atlas of cancer, highlighting patterns never before observed in the country. The Atlas, which has not been made public yet, has also thrown up surprises: districts in India with the world?s highest incidence of certain tumours and previously unsuspected cancer belts in the south and the north. It has also confirmed suspicions that India is in the grip of tobacco-related cancers of the mouth, head and neck, and the lungs. 

 The National Cancer Registry Programme, the cancer-tracking effort of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in Bangalore, compiled the Atlas using data from 105 hospitals and pathology clinics across 82 districts in most states. But researchers caution that the Atlas gives only minimum incidence rates ? the actual incidence of cancer may be higher. ?It?s the most comprehensive picture of cancer in India so far,? says Dr Nirmal Kumar Ganguly, director general of the ICMR. 

 Even the minimum incidence rates in some districts in India rank at the top of global cancer charts: women in Delhi show the highest incidence of gall bladder cancer ? 10 per 1,00,000. Kohima in Nagaland has a high incidence of cancer of the nasopharynx ? the region between the nose and the throat ? 19 out of 1,00,000. Wardha in Maharashtra leads the world in mouth cancer in men ? 10 per 1,00,000. 

 Scientists believe they could spend years trying to understand why the incidence of a particular cancer is high at a site or what environmental or genetic factors are at play. ?Finding answers to such questions could take time,? says Dr Vinay Kapoor, a senior gastrointestinal surgeon at the Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS) in Lucknow. 

 The mapping exercise has shown that Aizawl has an incidence of stomach cancer at 40 per 1,00,000, a figure close to the world?s highest rate in Japan. The study has also revealed a zone of penile cancer in northeastern Tamil Nadu and a belt of thyroid cancer in women across several coastal districts of Kerala that extends along the west coast into Karnataka and south Goa. 

 While researchers say that tobacco may explain the cancers in the mouth, head and neck, and the lungs, the new findings from the Atlas provide fodder for fresh investigations. In the Northeast, doctors plan to probe the cause of the high incidence of stomach and throat cancers. ?There is probably a genetic explanation for the stomach cancer,? says Dr Eric Zomawia, a pathologist at the Civil Hospital in Aizawl. An unusually high incidence of cancers of the nasopharynx in Imphal and Kohima has also baffled scientists. 

 Nasopharynx cancer is particularly high among tribals in Ukhrul and Churachandpur districts of Manipur. ?There is a tradition among tribals here to burn pine wood in closed dwellings. Does the smoke contain carcinogens? We don?t know yet,? says Dr Yanglem Mohen Singh, head of pathology at the Regional Institute of Medical Sciences in Imphal. Nor do researchers have any firm theory to explain the thyroid cancer along the southwestern coast. Some parts of Kerala have high radiation caused by thorium-rich sand, but thyroid cancer among women is also unusually high in coastal districts of Karnataka and south Goa where there is no radioactive sand. Scientists are now speculating whether the cancer may be linked to diet along the coast. 

 The high incidence of gall bladder cancer among women in Chandigarh and Delhi also appears downstream along the Gangetic plain, says Kapoor at the SGPGIMS. A study by scientists in Varanasi had shown heavy metals in gall bladder cancer tissues from patients and gave rise to a hypothesis that toxins in the Ganga may be ?environmental triggers? for the cancer. In the absence of proof, researchers are also exploring genetics of gall bladder cancer. 

 Two-thirds of gall bladder cancer patients have had gallstones. According to a study, one in four women above the age of 50 in northern India has gallstones. However, most stones are silent and do not cause symptoms. ?If we find genes linked to gall bladder cancer, we could screen the population,? says Kapoor. Women with genes implicated in the cancer may be advised to have their gall bladders removed even with silent gallstones. 

 The Atlas comes at a time when India?s medical community is concerned about an anticipated increase in the number of patients diagnosed with cancer each year mainly due to increased life expectancy but also from changes in lifestyle or diet. The Atlas has authenticated previous findings that breast cancer has overtaken cervical cancer as the most common cancer among women in Bangalore, Calcutta, Delhi, and Mumbai. Changes in the reproductive cycle in women associated with small numbers of children and even diet may be contributing to this shift towards breast cancer. 

 The government estimates that about 8,00,000 people are diagnosed with cancer across the country each year, tobacco-related cancers accounting for at least 30 per cent of all cancers. But doctors and health policy-makers are worried about lack of awareness about cancer, inadequate diagnostic facilities, and non-uniform treatment services. ?I think a significant proportion of cancer patients in India don?t receive the best available treatment,? says Dr Purvish Parikh, a senior doctor at the Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai. 

 A health ministry document on cancer control says 50 per cent of patients in India seek treatment in the advanced stages of cancer. Doctors estimate that seven out of 10 women with cervical cancer arrive in hospitals when the cancer has spread. ?There is a shortage of specialists in India who can pick up subtle differences in cervical cells that occur in the earliest, treatable stages of cancer,? says Dr Bhudev Das, director, Institute of Cytology and Preventive Oncology, Noida, a suburb of New Delhi. 

 Doctors also say India needs to pursue ?realistic treatment? policies. The cost of treatment depends on the cancer ? some tumours such as choriocarcinoma may be cured in just Rs 500 while some blood cancer transplants requiring bone marrow transplants may cost Rs 1 million. But extra payment does not always mean significant gains. A specific line of chemotherapy for breast cancer is five times more expensive than another treatment but the difference in benefit is merely five to ten per cent. 

 Standard chemotherapy for lymphoma is about Rs 40,000 for six cycles. If doctors add a specific anti-cancer agent to standard chemotherapy, the treatment cost shoots up to over Rs 5,00,000. Patients who receive the additional drug respond slightly better than those who get standard chemotherapy. But doctors and patients have to question whether it is worth the expense. ?It?s a difficult decision,? says Parikh. 

 Sometimes wrong medical decisions fail to pick up early cancers. A 40-year-old woman who had had her gall bladder removed for gallstones in a private clinic a year back was in the SGPGIMS last month with severe jaundice. Tests revealed a five-centimetre tumour in the region where the gall bladder had been removed. 

 ?She probably had hidden cancer with gallstones,? says Kapoor. Had the gall bladder been sent to a pathology laboratory, the earliest signs of cancer may have been detected and her liver and lymph nodes examined for signals of residual cancer. ?When patients come with such recurrences of gall bladder cancer, they are beyond cure,? says Kapoor. Yet, even today, not all gall bladders are sent for examination. 

Within the next two weeks, the health ministry is 

expected to release the Atlas of cancer as well as announce fresh initiatives 

to improve training and awareness to tackle some of these problems. As Parikh 

puts it: ?The first step towards preventing cancers is to understand what?s causing 

them.?

Each time pathologist Eric Zomawia at the Civil Hospital 

in Aizawl snared a malignancy in a biopsy sample under his microscope, he would 

feed details of the patient and the tumour via the Internet into an electronic 

database that led to Indias cancer map. Doctors like Zomawia are the unknown 

researchers who contributed to the national mission to map cancer patterns. And 

the technique that they used to send the data to the Bangalore centre may serve 

as a trend-setter for future health intelligence collection in India. 

Several hundred collaborating doctors in the 82 participating 

districts had passwords to access the website of the Atlas where they could key 

in details of each malignancy that they detected during the two-year study. The 

ICMR recruited software experts to develop special programmes that could compile 

incoming data and analyse it to produce the patterns of cancer incidence in each 

district and compare it to incidences elsewhere in the world. 

But while technology makes it easy to instantaneously 

collect health information from distant sites, not all may be interested in sharing 

data. The ICMR had initially wanted at least 200 pathology centres to collaborate 

in the cancer Atlas project, but only 105 joined it. Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand 

and Uttar Pradesh remained uncovered. For truly national coverage, ICMR officials 

estimate that 800 hospitals and pathology laboratories in the public and private 

sector would need to contribute to such a database. Only then would the ground 

realities be visible in stark detail.

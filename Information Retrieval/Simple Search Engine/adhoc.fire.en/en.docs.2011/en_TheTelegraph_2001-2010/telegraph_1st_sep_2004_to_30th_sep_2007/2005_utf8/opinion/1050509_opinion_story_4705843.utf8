 Letters to Editor

 The right choice

 Sir ? The Board of Control for Cricket in India needs to put an end to all the drama and appoint Greg Chappell as the new coach of the Indian cricket team (Will credentials alone count or..., May 8). Chappell?s cricketing credentials are impeccable, something which would put him ahead of the rest of the pack. Not only that, he is a close student of the game ? remember how he sorted out Sourav Ganguly?s batting problems which helped the latter score runs in Australia? The success of any cricket team often depends upon the coach?s equations with the captain, and it is common knowledge that Ganguly shares more than just a professional relationship with Chappell. Finally, the Indian dressing room boasts of too many superstars, and it would need someone of Chappell?s stature to keep these spoilt brats? feet firmly on the ground.

 Yours faithfully,

 Krishna Ghosh, Calcutta 

 Vetoed out

 Sir ? The UN general secretary, Kofi Annan, has declared in no uncertain terms that there will be no veto power for the new members in an expanded security council of the world body (? Seat at high table minus veto?, April 29). The secretary general?s comment not only proves that the UN believes in a hierarchy of nations, but it also goes against the doctrine that all sovereign states are equal. In international politics, the equality of sovereign states is more of a myth than a reality, which explains why Annan is wary of granting India the special provision which only the permanent members of the council enjoy. 

 There is yet another reason, though, for denying India the veto. By exercising the power, the permanent members of the council ensure that the UN accepts, and acts upon, only those proposals that have their support. Giving India a similar right would queer the pitch for the Big Five whose writ runs large in the UN.

 Yours faithfully

Jayotee Bhattacharjee, Silchar

 Sir ? A seat in the UN security council sans veto power is completely unacceptable from the Indian point of view. During his four-day visit to the capital, Annan sounded more like a spokesperson of the P-5 nations, than the secretary general of a world body. His insistence on India signing the comprehensive test ban treaty and the fissile material cut-off treaty clearly indicates that the West is trying to stall India?s progress in international affairs. If India were to be granted a seat in the security council without veto power, the permanent members would find it easy to silence India?s protests against their discrimination and highhandedness. The inputs of the new members will come to naught as long as the old members continue to dominate the council.

 Yours faithfully,

Sayantan Das, Konnagar

 Sir ? If developing countries like India are to be treated on a par with the superpowers of the world, the UN needs to do away with the system of veto power altogether. But it is unlikely that the five nations who have veto power would forfeit their special rights. Unfortunately, despite Annan?s pious promises, democratization of the UN is still a distant dream.

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Sir ? Kofi Annan had talked about restructuring the UN to make it more representative and ensure that the organization does not become redundant in the modern world. Hence,Annan turning down New Delhi?s request for veto power came as a surprise. Expanding the security council without giving the new members the same rights as permanent members is a cosmetic reform at best.

 Yours faithfully,

Jang bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur 

 Sir ? What is the use of India becoming a member of the security council if it still has to take orders from P5 nations? Does Kofi Annan think that friendship between unequals is possible? It would have been better if the UN ensured that the permanent members of the security council surrender their veto power. Either that or accept India as the new member of the council with the same powers as the other five nations. India is already a nuclear power with a thriving economy. What more does a country need to become a member of the security council?

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is unlikely that the permanent members of the security council would welcome a new entrant like India to their club. That too with the same rights as theirs. However, India needs to take advantage of its warm relations with other member countries and pitch for a permanent membership with veto power. Indo-US relations are at an all-time high, both China and Japan are vying for India?s attention and the country has been praised by other south-east Asian nations for its stellar role in the tsunami relief operations. The chances of India booking a seat at the high table could never get any better than this.

 Yours faithfully,

Ajit Pandey, Howrah

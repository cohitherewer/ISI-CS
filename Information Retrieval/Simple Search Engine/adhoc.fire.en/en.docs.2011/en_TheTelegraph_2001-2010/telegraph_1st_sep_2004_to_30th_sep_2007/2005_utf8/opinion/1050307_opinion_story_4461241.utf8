 UNCIVILIZED

 ?An assembly of good fellows? was Dr Johnson?s definition of a club in the 18th century. In Johnson?s time, the London clubs were still part of the world of taverns and coffee-houses, with their freer notions of conviviality. But the character of these clubs changed over the next few centuries ? through the rigours of Empire, and through British aristocratic as well as middle-class investments in certain notions of social exclusivity and intercourse. In the outposts of the Empire, these institutions became havens of ?civilization?, where the good fellows could be among their own kind without having to put up with the tiresomeness of native social aspirations. Architecture and ethos, food and dress, manners and talk, all fitted together beautifully here. But two great wars, votes for women and the end of Empire also meant immense changes in what it meant to be civilized. It became unconscionable to keep women out of Oxbridge, and natives out of the clubs. And this created practical problems ? the terrible bother of modernity, and that too a democratic modernity. What, for instance, would the good fellows wear, so hopelessly mixed up now in race and class? What happens to manners once the grand old consensus breaks down? Tollygunge Club seems to be grappling with this still. And its new rules are bizarre, to say the least. In certain areas of the club ? amusingly called the Tipu Sultan Dining Room and the Regal Lounge ? national dress is now formally disallowed. Members wearing the dhoti and kurta are also barred from entering the bars, lounge and billiards room at the Saturday Club. (Interestingly, saris do not seem to create a problem here.) 

 Clubs are perfectly within their rights to insist on certain standards of etiquette and decency regarding dress and behaviour. And to accuse clubs of being elitist is as pointless as accusing a library of being bookish. Elitism is not at all the point here. Rules of formal behaviour in the postcolonial world have naturally assimilated certain colonial mores, especially so in matters of what to wear. Yet, every society adapts these rules to its native traditions of politeness, creating its own forms and standards of sociability and grace. In this context, to disallow national dress is not only ludicrously regressive, but a form of conservatism that might also be described as inherently uncivilized.

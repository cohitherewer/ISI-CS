 SURVIVAL STRATEGY

 The Yechuri-Karat episode exposes the CPI(M)?s double standards, says Ashis Chakrabarti

 Odd men out

 If you?ve watched some of the Bengali television channels over the past few days, you probably saw Sitaram Yechuri and Brinda Karat in a new light. Of course, the two leading lights of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) have been the party?s most presentable TV faces for some time. What was rather uncommon this time was not just their appearances on the Bengali channels; it was the spectacle of their success with the Bengali language. And thereby hangs a tale.

 Considering that they never lived in Bengal, their ability to speak the language deserved more than faint praise. Yechuri is from Andhra Pradesh and Karat, though born a Bengali, lived and worked in Delhi most of her life, thereby getting very little opportunity to speak her native tongue. 

 The problem is that despite their admirable show of language skills, Yechuri and Karat were almost put on the dock. Their Bengali was a discovery for most viewers, but the critics wondered what that had to do with their nomination to the Rajya Sabha from Bengal. 

 We already know part of the answer. The CPI(M)?s nomination of the two very important members of its politburo to the Rajya Sabha signifies a major change in the party?s attitude to parliamentary politics. In any communist party?s scheme of things, the organization comes first. Traditionally, the party would keep a clear distinction between the organization men and the parliamentary leaders. 

 There were a few other organization men who were inducted to parliamentary jobs. But that was more an exception than the rule. Much has changed in the CPI(M). The party?s decision to allow Somnath Chatterjee to become the Lok Sabha speaker was one more evidence of the growing importance of parliament for its strategies. That the present government at the Centre is so crucially dependent on the support of the left also explains why the CPI(M) puts such an emphasis on parliament now. 

 But the nomination of Yechuri and Karat from Bengal is a different matter. It shows yet again that as the CPI(M) accepts the primacy of the parliamentary path, it also has no qualms about reneging on political morality. This was the same party that presented a very different face when the National Democratic Alliance government moved an amendment to the Representation of People?s Act in 2003. The amendment dispensed with the requirement that Rajya Sabha candidates must be ordinarily resident in ?that state or territory? from which they are seeking election. 

 The Congress supported the amendment, thereby helping it become the new law. But both the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party had their vested interests. Both parties had several members of the Rajya Sabha elected from states where they did not live. The most celebrated was the case of the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, who lived in Delhi but was a Congress member of the upper house from Assam. Other big names in this category included two former BJP presidents, M. Venkaiah Naidu and K. Jana Krishnamurthy, another party luminary, Arun Jaitley, and the Congress?s R.K. Anand. 

 But the CPI(M) would not do such a thing and thereby circumvent the federal character of the Constitution, the then party leader in the Lok Sabha and the present speaker, Somnath Chatterjee, thundered, while opposing the amendment. He also saw it as an infringement on the states? rights. The substitution of the word ?state? by ?India? was, to him, an attack on the sanctity of the Constitution. 

 Not just inside parliament, even outside it the CPI(M) was up in arms against the new law. The party issued statements opposing the law and accusing both the BJP and the Congress of conspiring to subvert the constitutional protection of federalism. When a petition was moved in the Supreme Court challenging the validity of the law, the CPI(M) was the only political party to support it.

 When the amendment was discussed in parliament, the national commission set up to review the working of the Constitution was going through one of its sessions. The commission too opposed the move, saying that the amendment would significantly alter the character of the Rajya Sabha, which is essentially a council of states. It recommended that the ?domiciliary requirement of eligibility to contest elections to the Rajya Sabha from the concerned state is essential? to preserving the basic federal character of the upper house.

 If you recall the CPI(M)?s opposition to the new law and the fact that the constitutional bench of the Supreme Court has yet to come out with its final verdict on the petition, you cannot escape the conclusion that the Marxists? decision to nominate Yechuri and Karat from Bengal is plain opportunism. The party has not only done a complete volte-face on its earlier stand, it has also taken advantage of the delay in the court judgment. 

 After this, any high moral ground that the party takes would be laughable. After this, the party?s old cry over the Centre?s ?step-motherly? attitude to the states would sound rather fake. And, if you recall the CPI(M)-sponsored opposition ?conclaves? of the Eighties which waxed eloquent on defending states? rights, you would know how far the Marxists have really come from those noisy days.

 It was rather pathetic to see Anil Biswas, secretary of the party?s Bengal unit, trying to wriggle out of the embarrassment. Local candidates would be put up for the other Rajya Sabha seats from the state, he said, that would fall vacant over the next two years. He knows that this is hardly the point. He does not seem to have much to say in self-defence about the moot point. 

 The point is not that Yechuri or Karat would not do a good job of their new assignments. Going by their debating records, they probably would do better than many other Rajya Sabha members of the party from Bengal. It is commonly argued that many of the CPI(M)?s MPs from the state feel out of their depths in Delhi?s high politics because they cannot speak freely enough either in Hindi or in English. Yechuri and Karat would definitely have an advantage over them in this. But this again is not the point. Most members from outside the Hindi-speaking states have the same problem.

 It is even possible that the two politburo members would serve Bengal?s cause in the Rajya Sabha more effectively than the ones from the state. After all, their importance in the party hierarchy may make them stronger voices, as far as the party is concerned. And, since Bengal is the reason for the party?s new-found national importance, it will only be in the party?s interest to ensure that Bengal?s interests are well served in parliament. 

 But all that does not alter the fact that the CPI(M)?s double standards stand exposed by the Yechuri-Karat episode. If you argue that this is nothing new, you would be absolutely right. The party never stops putting up new faces. It actually thinks that is how it survives and grows. For it, as for any other party, strategy, not morality, is the name of the game in politics. It would be na?ve to believe any pretensions to the contrary.

 DIARY

 If you are a politician, you can afford to be sick only if you?ve been pensioned off, and that too if you?re someone important enough ? say, an ex-PM, ex-Union minister, at the very least, an ex-CM ? to merit treatment abroad at public expense. If you aren?t any of these, then ill health can be only a liability. Ram Vilas Paswan discovered this only recently. The Lok Janshakti leader was advised open heart surgery by a cardiologist who is widely considered to be the best in the business and who also runs a speciality hospital in the capital. Paswan had sought out this doctor and had even shifted to his hospital from the Patna Heart Hospital, where he was first admitted after a mild heart attack. Which is why it?s strange that not only did Paswan not have a bypass surgery done, he also shifted to another hospital for a far simpler and less time-consuming procedure ? an angioplasty. Clearly, politics had won out. The second assembly elections in Bihar this year, scheduled for Oct-Nov, is getting nearer by the day and who knows, the suggestion for a complicated surgery which would put him out of the loop for the next six months, could be a Congress-RJD or BJP-JD(U) conspiracy to make hay while Paswan lay (in a hospital bed). Paranoia, thy name is politician. 

 This is quite the season for sick politicians. At the other end of the political spectrum, Arun Jaitley?s in hospital too with high blood pressure and lung infection. And believe it or not, he is being sorely missed. His partymen may or may not feel his absence, but morning-walkers at the Lodhi Gardens do, accustomed as they are to the ex-law minister?s freewheeling discourses on affairs of the state and his party as he took his constitutional. After the walk, Jaitley and his group would amble over to the lounge at the nearby India International Centre, sit at their favourite table near the bay windows, and gossip loudly. They must have made quite a din because there?s a placard nearby which says, ?No more than six people are allowed at one table. Please talk softly.? With Jaitley and his raucous circle absent for some time now, the table wears a sadly forlorn look these days. It too must be missing Jaitley.

 They might disagree about everything else, but the CPI(M) and Subrata Mukherjee have one thing in common ? their hatred for Javed Khan. The former has tried every trick, called him everything from land mafia to goonda, to make a dent in Khan?s popularity in Tangra, Topsia, Tiljala. That he is almost worshipped by the people of these areas is evident from his 10,000-vote victory margin in the civic elections. 

 The ex-mayor has other grouses ? Khan can be very stubborn when he wants to be, he can face up to the CPI(M) on his own and does not sweet-talk his boss. Worse, as overseer of health in the city, Khan had started a drive against filthy kitchens in hotels and restaurants, in which he had netted some of the mayor?s friends. Last but not the least, Khan had provided the land on which the Trinamool?s HQs now stand, to Mamata Banerjee?s eternal gratitude. No wonder, Mamata loves him. At a public meeting before the civic polls, she very pointedly said of Khan: ?I know he will not, unlike others, dream of harming me.? Not many know that didi calls Khan brother and ties a rakhi on his wrist every year and also puts bhai phonta on him. It is not for nothing that Muslims are gravitating back to the Trinamool. 

 Sometime back, these columns had reported on a leading realtor, also a prominent functionary of a football club, who had evicted a tenant from a property on Rash Behari Avenue with the help of the police and a forged court order. But this time the Calcutta high court has been truly shocked to discover how the same realtor, aided by ?several very senior police officers?, including the OC of Gariahat police station, had demolished shops along the avenue and evicted shopkeepers. Apparently, the operation was carried out to coincide with Hugo Chavez?s visit to the Dhakuria Lakes, when the heavy police presence would mean the victims couldn?t protest in retaliation. Besides the court, there has been another attack from a different direction. The party office being only a few metres from the site of the demolition, the CPI(M) bosses of south Calcutta are very angry. They have submitted a list of tainted policemen to the CM. Now will we see some action finally? 

 The story might be apocryphal, but it explains a lot of things. For one, why Narayan Rane, till the other day one of Bal Thackeray?s most reliable foot soldiers, has become a turncoat. And two, why Uddhav Thackeray arouses such distaste among most Shiv Sainiks. Apparently, sometime in mid-June, Shesh Rao Girhipunje, an ex-district chief from Bhandara in Maharashtra, turned up at Uddhav?s door seeking his help to resolve a crisis in the local chapter of the party. He was kept waiting for three hours, after which the PA of the Sena?s putative chief came out to tell him that his boss couldn?t see him that day because he was very depressed. A fish he had bought for a lakh-and-a-half rupees had died that day. Stunned, Girhipunje approached Rane, who went all out to help him. The next day, the story was splashed all over the media, and the rest is history. The story is fantastic but even if it?s half-way true, the Sena chief has a lot to worry about.

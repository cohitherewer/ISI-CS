 THE PM AND THE TIGERS

 Malvika Singh

 The tragedy of the extermination of tigers continues unabated. The Central ministry of environment and forests is misleading and fooling the prime minister and his government about the seriousness of the situation because when the truth is revealed, it will expose those gentlemen who are responsible for the horror. This is why they are working overtime to cover up their unforgivable misdeeds. The minister, secretary and director of Project Tiger are desperately trying to prevent the PM from receiving true information and are lobbying with officers and colleagues close to Racecourse Road in an attempt to misrepresent the reality. This is because they comprehend well that without enough evidence from the real tiger and environment experts, who remain outside the government, they can run amuck with false and incomplete information, and derail the PM. 

 Manmohan Singh?s close colleagues must realize that they are being led by a faction with vested interests into a situation where they will in fact be betraying their leader who has instinctively acted correctly. Perpetrators of the corruption must be punished and kept at bay. They are detrimental to all positive change and are therefore terrified by the resonant voices of NGOs preventing the fatal destruction of our natural treasures. They are trying to convince the PM that the situation is not half as serious as is being made out by the likes of us. Bureaucratic games have demolished the ethics of this great country.

 Above it all

 Manmohan Singh stands apart in this spreading quagmire. He stands high above it all on dry land, and the guilt-laden fear that has beset his elected representatives as well as their officers, is compelling them all to pull him into the sinking sand with them in an attempt to silence him and save their skins. It is for the PM not to take his officers at face value, not to trust them without question, because they are furiously extracting all they can from this open, honest and generous man. The tiger debacle and its cover-up is merely the tip of the iceberg. The same is happening everywhere and in almost all areas. Misinformation, misinterpretation, and misleading the boss have become the norm of survival for the incompetent administrator. The expos? is imminent, hence the hysterical insecurity.

 Having bumped over the non-existent tarmac in Punjab for hours, I returned to Delhi and on scanning the newspapers, found the director of preProject Tiger, set up by Indira Gandhi to protect the animal and its habitat, abusing one of our most valuable and internationally acknowledged researchers. His letter to the editor in the Indian Express only goes to prove how arrogant and clueless such bureaucrats are and how they have defied the great tradition and legacy of political environmentalists like Indira and Rajiv Gandhi.

 Ironic and weird

 It is truly ironic and weird that he should be presiding over Project Tiger under a Congress-led coalition at a time when the assault on the subject of his department has been a massacre. Had he been honourable, he should have resigned in the light of these illegal killings that happened during his tenure. And every Indian knows that none of this could have happened without the connivance of forest departments and their staff. Indians see corruption and recognize it. We do not need to hear the false rebuttals. It does not behove an upright bureaucrat to behave in this untoward manner.

 Rajesh Gopal, director of Project Tiger, claims that we, outside the government, can claim credibility only if we adopt an anti-system posture. To counter his outburst, we should create a tiger task-force that reports directly to the PM led by Karan Singh, the only continuum with the creation of Project Tiger.

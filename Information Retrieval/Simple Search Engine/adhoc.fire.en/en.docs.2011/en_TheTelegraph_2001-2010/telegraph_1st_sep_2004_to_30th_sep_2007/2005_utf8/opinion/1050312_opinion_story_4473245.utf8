 Letters to Editor

 Go by the instructions

 Sir ? ?Top priority: protect Sonia? (March 4) has Ambika Soni declaring that the adhyaksha had ?instructed? her party to go by the Constitution. Could she have given a contrary order without being seditious? In this context, one is intrigued by the role of a person who disgraced himself by being ?caught? trying to subvert the Constitution not many moons ago. Reportedly, he was closeted with the Jharkhand governor before the latter took his decision. What are his qualifications for educating the governor on the spirit of the Constitution? Will the public now be told that he was there without the knowledge of the adhyaksha?

 Yours faithfully,

Sunil V. Khaitan, Calcutta

 Racing ahead

 Sir ? Certain sections of the Indian population and the media seem to be getting excited by the fact that Sania Mirza and Narain Karthikeyan have been making headlines without bothering to find out what their achievements are. The meteoric rise of Sania in the women?s ATP circuit and Karthikeyan?s making it to big league racing have certainly captured the fantasy of the man on the street. This goes to show that good performance in any sport brings media attention and sponsors. Hence, blaming the media for excessive promotion of cricket at the cost of other sports is mere hogwash. 

 But then cricket-baiters are being too optimistic if they think that the game will vanish from the news pages. Sania and Karthikeyan ruled the roost at a time when India had no international cricket commitments. With the high profile India-Pakistan series getting underway, the attention will once again veer away from the tracks and the lawn to the field. The cricket raj is far from over.

 Yours faithfully,

Anagh Pal, Calcutta

 Sir ? Narain Karthikeyan is one person who has lived up to his dreams. Even though he finished 15th in the race, the opportunity to compete with drivers like Michael Schumacher is itself an achievement. One could have never thought of India being able to make it to Formula One racing without Karthikeyan. Yet throughout the stint, the he kept his head. The sports minister, Sunil Dutt, should give as much encouragement to Karthikeyan as he did to Sania. 

Yours faithfully, 

Sumant Poddar, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Formula One racing must be brought to India since it has an infrastructure good enough to host it. Unless India tries to host a big racing event, Karthikeyan?s success will remain a flash in the pan. 

Yours faithfully, 

Vinay Dokania, Calcutta 

 Non-performers

 Sir ? In the course of the presentation of the police budget in the state assembly every year, we are told about the need for equipping the police with more firepower. On several occasions our policemen have been found to be too shy to take aim. During the American Centre fiasco, 64 policemen stood mute spectators as two men on a motorbike shot at them. During the more recent eviction in Gobindapur rail colony, the police could not implement the high court order for the fear of violence. The police commissioner confirmed that the operation had been called off to avoid bloodshed. But when it comes to hapless law-abiding citizens, our police are far from their usual non-violent selves, as Akshay Gambhir found out recently (?Bashed for war of words with cop?, March 3). With such a double-faced, non-performing police force, what is the use of allocating such an enormous sum for wages, logistics, subsidized rationing and so on at taxpayers? cost? The job of maintaining peace in localities can be outsourced to local ganglords. That will be cost-effective too.

Yours faithfully, 

Bappa Kanta Pal, Calcutta

 INVALID POLITICS 

 It is not the business of the government to be in business. A conflict of interest underpins this axiom. A government is driven by political considerations. A business venture should be driven only by the profit motive. When politics and profit come into conflict, a government always chooses politics. This has always been the problem with public sector units in India. The latest example of this is the decision to set up a refinery in Amethi, the constituency in Uttar Pradesh from which Mr Rahul Gandhi has been elected to the Lok Sabha. This is a classic instance of the present government, despite all its championing of economic reforms, falling back upon a well-known pre-reform ploy. In the days when the government, rather than the market, was the key arbiter of economic decisions, the resources of public sector units were used shamelessly by the government to nurse certain constituencies. The project to invest in a refinery in Amethi is a move to better Mr Gandhi?s electoral prospects. The decision has no economic justification or logic. Previous proposals to build a refinery in Amethi were shelved because they were deemed to be non-viable. UP has a refinery in Mathura. Moreover, there is a demand-supply mismatch. Demand has been growing too slowly to justify additions to capacity. Viability through exports does not hold for Amethi since a refinery there would face high transport costs if it were to be driven by exports. Such costs will become very important once the import duty protection disappears. The economic arguments against a refinery in Amethi are far too many.

 The reasons for the project and the enthusiasm showed for it by the petroleum ministry can thus only be political. There are two considerations to be kept in mind here. One concerns the autonomy of public sector units. Bharat Petroleum, which is supposed to execute the project, should be allowed to make its own feasibility study. The government, if it is at all serious about liberalization, should stay away from the project and all decisions concerning it. The other has to do with politics. Mr Gandhi, and those who are trying to please him, should review the benefits that a refinery can possibly bring to the people of Amethi. A refinery does not have great employment generating potential. The benefits will be indirect ? better roads and stable power supply. But to bring these to Amethi, there is no need for a refinery there.

 Paperback Pickings

 Good, fresh and not established

 First proof (Penguin, price not mentioned) is subtitled ?the Penguin Book of New Writing from India? and collects short fiction, travel-writing, reportage, and essays by interesting Indian writers ?who have enjoyed acclaim but not as wide a readership as they clearly deserve?. The publishers hope that the ?good, fresh writing? will be full of ?promise? and ?surprise?, and then resort to the cheapest of tricks to disorient the reader. The book has two inverted halves ? you start reading the non-fiction, and then you have to turn the book around and start reading the stories, from the other end of the book. Some of the writing is good (?The Maxims of Rochefoucauld. French or German fellow, he thought distractedly. And then he read: ?Few men are able to know all the ill they do.?? Anuradha Roy), some of it clever (?The man was holding on to his glass of whisky as if it were a sceptre signifying his rule over a lost kingdom.? Indrajit Hazra), and sometimes there are too many adjectives (?You make the teeming crossing over to the other side, on the eroded spine of the great bridge, alongside atrophied mules pulling carts lurching on wobbly axles, and overstuffed buses keeling perilously.? Sankarshan Thakur). There is also Sarnath Banerjee?s graphic short story, ?Route 36?. 

 D?j? view (Hodder, ? 3.50) by Lisa Armstrong is a skilfully written fun-novel about a perfect marriage. Armstrong is the style editor of The Times, and her previous novels were called Front Row, Dead Stylish and Bad Manors. Sample the faux-Jane Austen opening lines: ?Sydney and Charlie Murray had the perfect marriage. They knew this because everyone kept telling them so. Charlie was happy to go along with the consensus ? any consensus really ? provided it didn?t prevent him from getting to work by 8.27 a.m. And Sydney was so busy having affairs she could only assume that perfection was a relative term.?

 The rough guide to the da vinci code (Rough Guides, ? 2.99) by Michael and Veronica Haag is a little book that brings together potted accounts of the histories, legends and locations which went into Dan Brown?s best-selling thriller. It is alluringly dedicated to ?The Refined Menace?, and has sections on early Christianity, Last Supper symbolism, history of the Grail, and location guides. The chapter on the Opus Dei is called ?Self-Mortification in Manhattan?.

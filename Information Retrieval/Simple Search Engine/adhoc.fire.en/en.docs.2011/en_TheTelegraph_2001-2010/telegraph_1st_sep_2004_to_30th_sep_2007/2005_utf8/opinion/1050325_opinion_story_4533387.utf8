 TACTICAL RETREAT

 A tactical retreat is a good idea, especially if some other course of action leads to an avoidable conflict. This clearly was Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s compulsion for agreeing to make Mr Subash Ghisingh the caretaker administrator of the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council. West Bengal?s chief minister had to choose between bowing to Mr Ghisingh?s pressure and letting him plunge Darjeeling into chaos and violence. It was not really a difficult choice. Governments have to bend over backwards sometimes to buy peace. The bitter memory of the bloody battle for a separate Gorkhaland state in the mid-Eighties, that Mr Jyoti Basu had to face, must have influenced Mr Bhattacharjee?s decision. Violence in Darjeeling now could create even greater complications, thanks to the Maoist insurgency in neighbouring Nepal. It speaks well of Mr Bhattacharjee?s political skills that he took New Delhi into confidence over the Darjeeling imbroglio. Given the topography of the place and the history of violent political stirrings there, the state government could not hope to tackle another such agitation without the Centre?s help. Also, an unbending government could have played into the hands of the more militant sections of Mr Ghisingh?s followers, who were itching to revive the old movement for Gorkhaland.

 The ball now is in Mr Ghisingh?s court. He can no longer accuse the government of imposing its will on him or on the people of Darjeeling. On the contrary, he may further lose popular support if he sticks to his militant posturings. The government has given him not only the post he sought but also the freedom that he wanted to go with it. In the face of stiff opposition from other political parties, the government has chosen him, and not a board, to run the caretaker administration. After all this, he cannot even pretend not to know what his task is. He can no longer stand in the way of the people?s right to elect a new council. It is his turn now to prove his democratic credentials.

 Letters to Editor

 Different strokes

 Sir ? In ?Democratic evangelism? (March 25), Swapan Dasgupta makes much of the similarities between Gerry Adams and Narendra Modi, especially in the matter of their reception by the dispensation in Washington DC. But he misses two important ones. Gerry Adams represents Sinn Fein, the respectable political face of a terrorist organization, the Irish Republican Army. Narendra Modi represents the Bharatiya Janata Party, the respectable political face of ? well, I guess we all know what. Sinn Fein translates to ?Ourselves Alone? in English ? a nomenclature bound to find favour with members of the sangh parivar. The differences between the two are even more revealing. Being a political party, the Sinn Fein has always distanced itself from the actions of its aggressive parent ? the IRA. The BJP, on the other hand, does not have the luxury of that alibi. 

 Yours faithfully,

Partho Datta, Calcutta 

 Read together

 Sir ? The juxtaposition of the two reports, ?Mother sells girl to brothel? and ?King of good times savours a buy?, under the headline, ?Meet the Indian princess, two faces? (March 23), highlights the gap between haves and have-nots in India. The poor mother, forced to sell her daughter ? still only a child ? into the flesh trade, provides a stark contrast to the plutocrat purveyor of alcohol aboard his luxury yacht. The present prime minister, who launched the LPG (liberalization, privatization and globalization) reforms in his previous avatar as finance minister more than a decade ago, had assured the nation that they would have a ?trickle down? effect. Ironically, liquor, which exacerbates the poverty of the lower classes, is the source of Vijay Mallya?s wealth. Will Manmohan Singh call this the ?trickle up? effect? Years ago, an investigative journalist had bought a girl, Kamala, to prove that women could be bought even in the capital city. It is obvious that 57 years after independence, we have not made any progress.

 Yours faithfully,

C.V.K. Moorthy, Calcutta

 Sir ? Vijay Mallya wants all Indians to be proud of the fact that he owns the third-largest liquor company in the world. But this is a country where a large section of the poor and even the middle classes ruin themselves and their families by consuming country liquor. Joygopal Basak, whose wife Deepali sold their daughter because of poverty, too spends a large part of his earnings on liquor. The government is eager to raise revenues from the sale of liquor and the shrewd businessman that he is, Mallya is making full use of the policy. Look at how he admits to searching for innovative ways to flout the government restrictions on liquor advertisements. 

 Mallya?s expensive lifestyle, his luxury yacht worth a staggering Rs 100 crore, are all funded with profits from his companies, in which many small investors have shares. Would he allow some of these shareholders on board his yacht? Mallya reveals his arrogance when he describes Richard Branson as the British Vijay Mallya. He should remember that India has a long way to go before it reaches the levels of prosperity in Britain. We would have been proud of Mallya had he spent a part of his fortune in stopping the Durgas and Julies from ending up in brothels. 

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

 Sir ? It is obvious that most Indians will bask along with Vijay Mallya in the glory of clinching a business deal. Life was and will always remain blissful for such magnates. But we should also learn to focus on the darker side of the picture. As long as poverty remains, parents will sell their daughters. One cannot just blame the trafficking racket. Many girls are sacrificed at the altar of poverty throughout the country, everyday. For families that find it difficult to make ends meet, this despicable option is seen as a ?blessing?. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sharmi Adhikary, Calcutta

 Sir ? When a man remains hungry because of poverty, no one comes to his rescue. But when he sends his daughter to work as a dancing girl, his neighbours belabour him with moral platitudes and pillory him. 

 Also, why is it considered so bad to have a girl get work as a dancer in a bar in Bihar? Many girls dance in Calcutta?s plush bars and their photographs get splashed all over the newspapers. When a rich man relaxes on his yacht with some models, none of the moral guardians dare to comment, saying it is his private affair. It seems morality is for the poor only.

 Yours faithfully,

Sanjoy Ghose, Calcutta

 Sir ? It was a grotesque sense of humour that prompted the arrangement of reports about a high-profile liquor baron and a poor mother who sold her daughter. By doing so, The Telegraph seems to be labouring the obvious. The media must address the facts of the issue without trying to sensationalize them, even as it discharges its moral and social responsibilities to the Indian public.

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir ? The ?Indian princess? reports reveal how as a pro-socialistic economy heading towards capitalism, we seem to have retained the gloomy aspects of both the economic systems.

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Sir ? There is no doubt that in today?s marketplace, one has to have 7-star hotels, plush shopping malls and swanky cars to attract foreign investment. But there should be more stress on the development of villages, where even the most basic facilities are non-existent, and where starvation deaths and selling of girls to the flesh trade are common. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

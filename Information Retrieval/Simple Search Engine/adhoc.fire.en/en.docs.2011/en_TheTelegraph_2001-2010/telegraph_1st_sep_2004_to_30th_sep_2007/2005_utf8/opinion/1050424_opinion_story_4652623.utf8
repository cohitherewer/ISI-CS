 DIARY

 He has always fancied himself to be the monarch of all he surveys. Maybe he derives this arrogance from his name. With a name like Akbar, one would fancy oneself. But in a democratic society, especially one in which the freedom of editors and journalists matter, such arrogance of power can cause some embarrassment. The secretary-general of the Editors? Guild, Om Thanvi, has resigned from his position in protest against the high-handedness of MJ Akbar, the present head of the Editors? Guild. According to Thanvi?s resignation letter, Mr Akbar did not even consult him about the breakfast meeting that the Editors? Guild organized with Pervez Musharraf. Thanvi was kept out of all arrangements, including the selection of editors for this meeting. When he asked MJ Akbar, he was dismissed imperiously and told, ?I am making the list and would inform the editors directly.? The list of invitees for the breakfast meet was decided according to the whims of Akbar, who left out the entire ABP group, invited the proprietor of an English daily, but not its editor, even though that editor is an old member of the Guild. Two ladies, neither members of the Guild nor editors, were conspicuous by their presence at the meeting. If Thanvi?s allegations are indeed correct, then editors were invited not to meet the Pakistan president but to be present at Akbar?s court. Unfortunately, there was no Tansen to sing and no Birbal for comic relief. There are times when the monarch himself is the court jester. 

 Once a performer, always a performer. The Union sports minister threw a tantrum on the eve of the sixth and final ODI between India and Pakistan, alleging that he had been slighted by the Delhi District Cricket Association. The DDCA on its part argues that Sunil Dutt is barking up the wrong tree and that he should take his grievance to the PMO. Dutt, who left for Mumbai in a huff just before the match began, insists that as sports minister, he should have got a ringside seat in the stadium. In other words, one inside the airconditioned bullet-proof box which was erected for the Pak president and the Indian PM. Prior to the match, his office had even cited protocol to demand that Dutt receive the two leaders at the stadium. But the DDCA (which had already sent 30 VVIP passes to him), since it wasn?t within its power to decide on such matters, had directed Dutt?s office to get in touch with PMO, and that is where the matter ended for it. But obviously not for Dutt. Anti-climax, we can say.

 Our parliamentarians may be illiterate but they are computer-savvy. In addition to an expensive PC, each MP now gets a HP iPAQ Pocket PC h6365, costing Rs 30,000 a piece. The five-in-one phone, which has advance features, ought to have been a trying experience for our MPs, given their educational standards. But no. They now insist on taking them home, pleading that it would be used by their children, or by their PAs. Incidentally, the secretariats of the two houses are by now reconciled to the fact that they have seen the last of the gadgets. 

 More on the house. The ever-increasing number of statues in the parliament now pose a threat to the lives of our dear MPs. Thanks to the decree of the Lok Sabha speaker, Somnath Chatterjee, they will now be placed in the parliament library complex, which is to have a state-of-the-art museum at the cost of Rs 40 million. Each statue will have a touchscreen which will display the details of the person engraved in stone. What is more heartwarming is that all parties have supposedly agreed to the proposal. That itself calls for a plaque.

 Why blame Arjun Singh alone for being obsessed with the detoxification drive? Had it been within the powers of K Natwar Singh, he would have rewritten India?s post-independence history minus the sanghis. It is well-known how Singh tried to stall the Pakistan president?s visit with Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Sad that Singh hadn?t bargained for Musharraf?s adamance. The General broke protocol and went on to meet the vikas purush, who is reputed to have fed him loads of khichri. Musharraf?s friendliness with the saffronites majorly upset Singh. And he made no efforts to hide the displeasure. When the PM and the General addressed the media at the conclusion of the talks, the foreign minister stayed away from the spotlight. Given that the MEA goes strictly by the laid-down drill in these matters, he should have been standing behind the PM when he read out the statement. But not our natty Natwar.

 The rumour mills in the capital are agog with the possibility of a home-coming ? Varun Gandhi?s return to the Congress. He is supposed to have been promised a Lok Sabha seat that may soon be vacated by Ajay Maken or Kapil Sibal. Both are serious contenders for Sheila Dikshit?s chair, which is going, going... With the Dikshits, there are now two khandans which have fallen out famously with 10, Janpath. As usual, the rank has its own story and the rajas their own. While the Dikshit camp complains of being let down and humiliated after sticking it out for years with the Nehru-Gandhis, the Janpathwallahs have a different version. It is Sandeep, Sheila?s son, who is supposed to have got the first family?s goat. Sandeep, east Delhi MP, reportedly echoed the sentiments of the young parliamentarians about their prospects of getting into the Union council of ministers being weakened by the presence of Rahul Gandhi. And now Varun, one may add, that is if Sheila does not manage to get an audience with madam soon.

 LOST HOME

 What stinks? The chairman of the West Bengal hu- man rights commission, Mr Shyamal Sen, had to hold his nose as he went through his inspection tour at Kishalay, a government-run home for destitute boys in Barasat. The building reeked with the filth of unclean, unhealthy bathrooms, living quarters and kitchen, while the boys had been locked up to prevent them from speaking to the visitor. They were desperate enough to attract his attention by banging utensils together, in order to get across to him a sense of their hopeless situation. Perhaps this is really the source of the stench ? deliberate cruelty, merciless abuse of power, unbounded callousness, inconceivable depths of corruption and, quite possibly, an insatiable glee in wielding full control over helpless youngsters. 

 Nothing else can account for the fact that the condition of Kishalay, and of the 31 other government-run shelters and remand homes, has been an open secret for many years. No satisfactory answers have ever been given to the terrifying questions raised by the goings-on in the Liluah home for destitute women a few years ago. What did come through was the failure of the authorities to follow the instructions for improvement of the home given by the state human rights commission in 2001. Since then, there also has been a charge of girl-running against the home, and escapes and pregnancies seem to be routine. At least 13 boys fled from Kishalay between last August and January this year, and some of the few brought back have alleged ?torture? by the authorities. This is a world of darkness where the concepts of rights or duties are irrelevant. Care is not a word that the officials have ever heard of. The state is more than willing to turn away from youngsters who, because of misfortune or petty crime, are treated as discards by society. Without this complicity, the officials appointed to look after the children in the homes would not have been able to keep their jobs. The government has pleaded helplessness: it cannot provide more than Rs 600 per head for the inhabitants of the homes, hence the mess. But surely that cannot explain the lack of care, and the abuse, mental, physical and sexual.

 There is apparently no counselling, no leisure activity, and creative training and medical facilities are abysmal. Overcrowding is a problem by itself. But it is exacerbated by the fact that children of all ages are lumped together, right up to the late teens, and sometimes youngsters who should be living in correctional homes are brought in to live with destitute, abandoned children. None of this matters: these children are not expected ever to return to a normal life with the possibility of basic rights, they are already invisible. The conditions in Kishalay, and every other home, could be very different, if anyone in authority thought it was worth the attention.

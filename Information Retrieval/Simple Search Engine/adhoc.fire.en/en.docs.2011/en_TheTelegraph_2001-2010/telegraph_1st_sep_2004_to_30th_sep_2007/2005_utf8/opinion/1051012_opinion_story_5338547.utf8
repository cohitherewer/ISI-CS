 MONEY FOR NOTHING

 Raju Mukherji

 Why is it that our government has such apathy for world class sportsmen? Anju Bobby George, Soma Biswas and Sushmita Singh Roy have done the country proud at the international stage. Now, a young girl from Manipur, M.C. Mary Kom, has won the gold medal at the women?s World Boxing Championship. Yet all these talented women do not get adequate assistance from sports organizations, the government or sponsors.

 The sponsors cannot distinguish between outstanding and moderate players. The sponsors are not sponsors in the real sense of the world, they are basically petty advertisers ? people who peddle wares without any notion about sports development.They spend millions to make models out of players who are useless at the international level.

 The bureaucrats and the politicians have only publicity in mind and so they keep close to only those sportspeople who are in the public eye. They extend help only to those projects which would get them more media exposure. Rarely would a politician provide assistance to a genuine sportsperson if the latter comes from a less-fancied sporting discipline.

 Divide and rule

 The sports officials are a lot with blinkers on. Their only intention is to stick to their chair year after year. All their efforts are spent on sticking to their posts by keeping the affiliated units happy. The administrators distribute largesse to keep corrupt club officials content because these officials have the right to vote in the annual general meetings.

 When one hears that Mary Kom is without a job, one is at a loss trying to understand why Narain Karthikeyan, who comes last in almost every race, earns millions while the world boxing champion, Mary Kom, is left without a job. It is equally difficult to understand the West Bengal government?s decision to grant prime land free of cost to Sourav Ganguly?s cricket academy when it couldn?t even find a small piece of land for the chess grandmaster, Dibyendu Barua? 

 The Andhra Pradesh government may have helped Sania Mirza prepare for world class tennis tournaments. But it is also true that the same government is guilty of not helping Koneru Humpy with funds. What is the reason for such discrimination? Why such apathy for world class players?

 What have the government and the sponsors done so far for weightlifters who won medals for India? What did we do for junior volleyball players who won the world championships last year? Top class boxers, athletes, rifle-shooters and snookers are being deprived of encouragement and financial assistance, whereas mediocre cricketers, footballers, golfers and racing-car drivers are being feted and funded. Is this the way to encourage sports in the country?

 Such a shame

 Mary Kom comes from a very humble background. She needs encouragement in the form of training, the best of trainers and equipment, and adequate diet and rest if she is to win the gold medal in the Olympics. All these need plenty of money. Where will that money come from?

 Mary Kom did not taste success overnight. She earned her success the hardest way imaginable. She did everything on her own with the help of her rare, natural talent. In time she went on to win two gold and one silver medals at the World Boxing Championships.

 The only recompense she has received from the government is an Arjuna award. Nothing more.Today, she lives off the paltry amount that she received along with the Arjuna award.

 The issue of Mary Kom is a national disgrace. If the country cannot come forward to help such genuine talents, then every sponsor and minister should hang his head in shame.

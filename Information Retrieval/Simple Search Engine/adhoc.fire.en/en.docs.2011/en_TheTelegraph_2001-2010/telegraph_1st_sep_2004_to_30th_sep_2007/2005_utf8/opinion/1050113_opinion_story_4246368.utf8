 CARE, AND NOT BE SEEN

 Gouri Chatterjee

 When the talk turns to the etiquette of celebrity giving, you know that normalcy has returned ? at least for the media. All may not be quite right with the world yet, but it?s alright again to point fingers at and question the motives of even those who care for tsunami victims, that is, be less than compassionate journalists once again.

 The warning signs were there early enough. I remember the distaste the words at the bottom of one TV screen ? ?Rahul Bose and Amitav Ghosh to spend 31st night with victims in Port Blair? ? evoked last New Year?s Eve till I realized they were a reporter?s, not the actor?s or writer?s.

 Since then, the barbs have flown thick and fast. Shah Rukh Khan turning his cheque to the prime minister into a photo opportunity (and may be a Padma award too), Vivek Oberoi adopting a village to stay in the news ? all the righteous indignation that the tsunami had sucked out of reporters and commentators is bubbling over once again. 

 And perish the thought that this mistrust of the rich and famous is a Third World media indulgence. Populism is the lifeblood of the popular press everywhere. 

 The British press has delighted in scolding Cherie Blair for allowing herself to be photographed while donating her sons? cast-off toys. The clash between America?s most popular (and most right-wing) news-channel talkmeister and the Hollywood star, George Clooney, has resulted in the actor inviting the anchor to join his tsunami-aid telethon to ?put your considerable money where your considerable mouth is?.

 The consensus is global: stars should care, but anonymously. Ok, may be they act as inspirations for others, but still, it is not seemly for them to benefit from their charity.

 Of course, the media could teach the celebs that lesson easily and effectively ? simply by not publishing the photographs and interviews that give the stars their public relations advantage.

 But that would be like going against nature. The cycle of life demands the media build up the celebrities so much that every shop they launch, every tiff they have is ?news?. The reason: stars sell. Then nature strikes. Nameless victims die in thousands, but the supermodel?s agony and the director?s bereavement get prominence. The reason: stars sell.

 The world is moved to help. Celebrities too. Again the media give them their due (for reasons above) ? but go on to lambaste them too for getting as much as giving. The reason: stars sell. I may have said this before: those who live by the media suffer by the media.

 All you want is news

 There was a delicious irony in seeing Christiane Amanpour covering the tsunami. It was as if the veteran of so many man-made disasters was acknowledging that nature still packed a few punches.

 For CNN, though, her presence marked something more ? an unexpected opportunity to prove it was still as good in what it started out to be 25 years ago: a news channel. 

 The good news is that CNN has emerged triumphant. No, I am not a shareholder of Time Warner. I am delighted because CNN, buoyed by its success, has gone and done what could be the beginning of something big: it has announced the end of its signature talk-show, Crossfire. 

 Begun in the Eighties, Crossfire was the template for all such shows on news channels since ? in America, India, everywhere. One issue, two sides supporting and opposing across a table, lots of screaming and shouting, no conclusion. Or, ?partisan hackery? that was lowering the level of political discourse, as Crossfire was described by one critic.

 And when something like the tsunami happens, you realize what little there is to talk about. All you want is news.

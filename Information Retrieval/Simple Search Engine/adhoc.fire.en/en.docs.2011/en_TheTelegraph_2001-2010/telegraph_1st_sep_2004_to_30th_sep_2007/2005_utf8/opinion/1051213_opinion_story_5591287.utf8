 Letters to Editor

 Thick as oil

 Sir ? It is understood that K. Natwar Singh has finally resigned under pressure from the Congress high command (?Natwar goes after shove?, Dec 6). But why the cabinet post alone? He should be stripped of his membership of the Lok Sabha too ? along with a suspension of the attendant benefits ? till investigations establish him as a clean man. The same treatment should be extended to all the politicians against whom charges of corruption and criminal activities have been brought. 

 Yours faithfully,

Salil Gewali, Shillong

 Sir ? The Volcker report has done its job. But the timing of the report and that of Anil Mathrani?s interview to a periodical point towards the CIA?s hand. It is no secret that the CIA maintains dossiers of every important person, famous and infamous, on the planet. The task is not as difficult as it sounds because the high and mighty of almost every nation has something to do with the United States of America. Either their children, friends or relatives work, study or stay in the US or have some economic interests there. And these dossiers come in handy whenever an influential person turns inimical to US interests. Of late, K. Natwar Singh had been lukewarm in his response to American military and business overtures. Perhaps he has been made to pay the price for it. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shivaji K. Moitra, Kharagpur

 Sir ? K. Natwar Singh has done the right thing by resigning from the cabinet, though quite late and hardly with good grace. The proper course would have been for the prime minister?s office to announce his exit. The way Singh tried to pre-empt this indicates that propriety has ceased to be a virtue with him. If the National Democratic Alliance had not stalled parliamentary procedures day after day, Singh might have been eased out of the cabinet sooner. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bishan Sahai, Calcutta

 Sir ? It seems that K. Natwar Singh best illustrates the adage that it is possible to wake up a sleeping person but not one who pretends to be asleep. Instead of taking his cue from Anil Mathrani?s revelations, Singh came up with the outrageous argument that his resignation would only amount to a confession of guilt, dragging the Congress deeper into controversy. It is good that the Congress working committee chose to be forthright in dealing with the ex-minister.

 Yours faithfully,

J.S. Acharya, Hyderabad

 Sir ? No tears need to be shed for K. Natwar Singh and his belated decision to leave the cabinet. The episode has given an indication of the impact a controversy involving a foreign country can have on domestic politics. Many believe that through the Volcker report, the Bush administration is interfering in Indian affairs. This does not seem to bother the media which is increasingly forsaking the tradition of conducting independent investigations. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad

 Sir ? Anil Mathrani, India?s ambassador to Croatia, is not an officer of the Indian foreign service. He was appointed secretary of the Congress foreign cell, and once the United Progressive Alliance came to power, Mathrani was appointed Indian envoy to Croatia by K. Natwar Singh himself. Mathrani has claimed that Sonia Gandhi authorized Natwar Singh, P. Shivshankar and a former petroleum minister, A.R. Antulay to visit Iraq in January 2000. All three visited Iraq and met important officials, including President Tariq Aziz, and made them believe that they, along with Natwar Singh?s son, Jagat, and Jagat?s friend, Andaleeb Sehgal, were members of the official delegation. According to Mathrani, Natwar took oil coupons for himself and on behalf of the Congress, and the Congress was aware of these kickbacks. Shivshankar has broadly agreed with Mathrani?s version, adding that Jagat Singh claimed he was youth Congress general secretary, which he was not. Natwar Singh is in a soup thicker than he can imagine.

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Das Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? If some new pieces have been discovered in the Volcker report jigsaw, then the media deserve credit for it. The Volcker report came out under the aegis of the United Nations, an organization which has no favour or prejudice towards India. Besides, Paul Volcker has made clear that he had no idea that K. Natwar Singh was an Indian cabinet minister. Singh belongs to a party which has harboured several corrupt politicians in its history. When the P.V. Narasimha Rao government was in trouble over the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha bribery case, the party shirked responsibility, saying that it was a parliamentary crime where the party was not involved. When Satish Sharma was caught with black money, he was protected by the Congress though the CBI wanted to bring charges against him. The fact that a minister?s son and son?s friend have been named in a high-profile scam shows how corruption in Indian politics is passed down from one generation to the next.

 Yours faithfully,

G.B. Srikantiah, Bangalore

 Sleep over it

 Sir ? Yet another allegation of death from medical neglect, and again a flat denial of charges by the hospital authorities (?Neglect cry over death?, Dec 7). Such reports hardly leave an impression on the minds of the readers these days ? first, because they appear almost daily, and second, the probes never precipitate any positive action. The time has come for the Indian Medical Association and other medical groups to ponder about the reasons behind the frequent attacks on the doctors. Few patients can afford legal help. The medical councils can give them hope by taking disciplinary action against errant doctors. Unfortunately, as the Supreme Court has recently observed, the medical council has become a ?den of corruption?. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kunal Saha, Columbus, US

 Sir ? I underwent a major operation at the Kothari Medical Centre recently, but my stay was far from pleasant. My room was on the seventh floor and every night, I would hear a noise from upstairs ? as if some construction work was in progress. Even under sedatives for three nights after the surgery, my sleep would be disturbed by the noise. The least a hospital can ensure is a good night?s sleep for its patients.

 Yours faithfully,

B. Dasgupta, Calcutta

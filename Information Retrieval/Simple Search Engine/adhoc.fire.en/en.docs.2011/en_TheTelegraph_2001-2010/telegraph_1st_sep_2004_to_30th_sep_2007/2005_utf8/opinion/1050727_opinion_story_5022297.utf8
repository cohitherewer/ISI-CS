 THE MEN AFTER THE BOYS

 Raju Mukherji

 Do senior test cricketers really need coaches ? Wonder what the Team India coach tells Sachin Tendulkar about batting or Anil Kumble about bowling! And why is it that the Hazares and the Gavaskars never needed any coaching? Or is it that modern test cricketers are not intelligent enough to learn from their own mistakes and thus have to be goaded into doing their routine jobs by a coach with a cane in hand?

 In the history of test cricket, the first ever official coach was Bobby Simpson. The chief reason for his appointment was that Australia had lost its best players to Kerry Packer in the late Seventies and the new players were woefully short on experience of international cricket. Men like Alan Border, Graham Yallop, Peter Toohey and Rodney Hogg were just starting off at the first class level. Simpson came out of retirement to lead these rookies to a resounding series victory over Bishan Bedi?s much-vaunted Indians.

 The Simpson-Border combine brought the world cup to Australia in 1987. Soon teams around the globe were appointing coaches. Cricket administrators thought that if Simpson could work wonders, so could other former test players. Most of the latter, however, had little or no experience in coaching. The best ones happened to be either average test cricketers like Dave Whatmore, Intikhab Alam and Geoff Marsh or first-class cricketers like John Buchanan.

 Not needed

 But coaching is not essential, certainly not for test cricketers. Coaches, however, can handle young players, especially at the under-16 level. That is when a cricketer really needs to have the best guidance. By the time a player makes his test debut, he would have played 5 to 10 years of representative cricket at various levels ? school, college and age-based cricket tournaments. 

 A player?s actual process of learning would be over when he plays first-class cricket. His technique and style are more or less ingrained by then. First-class and test cricketers are never too keen to change their technique because they have already found success with it. So if Virendra Sehwag were asked to defend, he would be a disaster. As would Dravid, if he were asked to go for over-boundaries. No amount of Greg Chappel?s guidance can improve Sourav Ganguly?s leg-side strokes. Besides, if Chappel could work wonders, he would have been able to do so with the other senior, first-class teams he has handled in the last few years. That has not been the case.

 Job hunt

 But if test cricketers do not need coaching, why do former test players vie for the job of a coach? The answer is simple: money, glamour and lack of effort. Today, the monetary benefits for coaches are astronomical. Most former cricketers find that they are not fit for any other well-paid job. Hence they make desperate efforts to become coaches of senior teams.

 There is also the glamour bit. Post-retirement, when players no longer occupy the centre-stage, a coach?s job at the international level gives them the exposure they crave for. Besides, the job itself can be quite effortless. Since a coach is basically dealing with top quality players, he does not have to work too hard on them. For instance, what novel concept of batting would a coach introduce to a highly experienced player like Dravid? Quite naturally, the modern coach has come to acquire a new baggage: psychologists, physiologists and so on, all of which adds to the hype. 

 If representing the country cannot motivate a cricketer, nothing can. Players like Polly Umrigar and Pankaj Roy once gave their everything to the national cap. Were they more committed than the modern crop of players, or is it that they were better equipped to look after themselves ?

 Letters to Editor

 They will have to go

 Sir ? Hand-pulled rickshaws will disappear from Calcutta tomorrow. The next day, it will be the hawkers. The day after that, roadside addas and para football will be asked to beat it. Who knows, the days of the annual book fair and the College Street book bazaar may be limited as well. The intentions must surely be noble. But one cannot help but wonder whether, sanitized of all these relics from the past, we will still be able to compete with New York or Shanghai. And, must we?

 Yours faithfully,

 Soma Sengupta, Calcutta

 Freedom dreams

 Sir ? Even as India celebrated its 59th independence day, we were left confronting the question: does this day have any significance for Indians today? Independence day today is just another national holiday. People look forward to the day not because it reminds them of their glorious history or the sacrifices of their forefathers, but because it breaks the monotony of their hectic daily routine. Patriotism for the present generation seems to be confined to downloading mobile ringtones of Sare jahan se achha, or watching a film set in the time of the freedom struggle, or at best, watching a cricket match involving India. The remedy is not to keep reminding the youth of how we earned freedom, but to stop dumping all our problems at the door of the British occupation, and concentrating instead on freeing India from communalism, crimes, and other social evils.

 Yours faithfully,

Ipsita Bhattacharya, Calcutta

 Sir ? The prime minister?s announcement in his Independence Day speech, of scholarships to the children of the armymen who have laid down their lives for the country, is welcome. But there are also others who sacrifice their lives for the country, without ever serving in the army. These men and women are not lesser martyrs than our brave soldiers. Maybe our corporate houses should come forward and set up a fund for providing scholarships to the children of those who gave their lives for the country.

 Yours faithfully,

Md. Aslam Parvez, Calcutta

 Sir ? In his pre-Independence Day address, the president, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, stressed the need to enhance energy production, with particular stress on non-conventional energy, such as hydel and nuclear power. The president stated that India has only 0.8 per cent of the world?s proved reserves of oil and gas while its population is 17 per cent that of the world. While India?s oil reserves are low, it has substantial reserves of natural gas. A good idea is to explore the oil shales in the North-east.

 During a professional visit to Assam a decade ago, I came across a Japanese team of experts studying the geology of the area. They told me that oil could be successfully extracted from the oil shale of the region and it would be economically viable. They also said that the coal of the region was suitable for conversion to oil. They indicated that a plant for such conversion could be economically viable if 50,000 tonnes of coal were available every month. The production from the coalfield was not much more than 50,000 tonnes at that time.

 A former chief of Oil India Ltd has reportedly affirmed that extraction of oil from the oil shales of Assam is likely to be a viable proposition today when the international price of oil has crossed $ 60 per barrel. He also said that considerable oil shales are available in the rejected dumps of coal mines. The challenge before our scientists now is to make the conversion of coal to oil commercially viable. It is possible to realize the president?s dream of a self-reliant India.

 Yours faithfully,

 K.B. Goswami, Calcutta

 THE RAILWAY CHILDREN 

 - Between freedom and entrapment 

 AVEEK SEN

 II. Akbar, Shubhash and Sooraj 

 Hero or victim? 

 If the little jharu has 

 become a symbol of how the railway children work for their 

 life and mobility, then there is something else ? less easily 

 visible, but just as ubiquitous ? that might come to symbolize 

 the obverse of this work. This is a piece of cloth soaked 

 in anything from dendrite to other kinds of glue, petrol, 

 photocopier solution, whitening ink or nailpolish remover. 

 You will see the children quickly whip this rag out of their 

 clothes, roll it into a ball, and then stuff it into their 

 mouth for a few gulps of intoxicating vapour. Addiction 

 to dendrite is almost like a subculture among these boys 

 (and girls), and is also common among homeless children 

 in the West. It can take on severe and incapacitating forms, 

 and often leads to addiction to more harmful substances. 

 But dendrite, in this case, becomes the basis of an exploitative 

 and potentially criminal traffic with the adults who surround 

 them. 

 One reason all the railway children 

 give for their addiction is that it deadens hunger-pangs, 

 especially when supplemented with paan masala. All 

 the little paan shops near a railway station, and sometimes 

 the tea stalls on the platforms, sell these substances to 

 the children in full knowledge of how they are used. It 

 is significant how, even in their addiction, the children 

 work in little groups, unthinkingly sharing their chemicals 

 and rags. This is also true of their love of gambling with 

 cards, another group activity that has its own rituals and 

 codes, its own ethic and ethics. Money changes hands during 

 these games in an alertly-watched-over manner, and the big 

 winner of the day has to treat his playmates to the next 

 meal, thus ensuring that the losers get to eat even if they 

 have played away all their day?s earnings.

 I remember Sheikh Akbar in Kharagpur 

 station, about ten years old, far gone in his addiction, 

 docile, abject, always drowsy, his eyes glazed, inhaling 

 almost continually. One of the volunteers working with the 

 boys had playfully snatched away his rag. The other boys 

 immediately improvised a little game, in the same playful 

 spirit, of recovering the rag from her. This they managed 

 in no time, returning it to Akbar in a kind of solidarity 

 looking like heartless pity. When the children get ready 

 to sleep, in the afternoon or at night, the rags come out 

 and are used almost unconsciously (like thumb-sucking, which 

 many of them retain well into their boyhood), just as any 

 other child would absent-mindedly play with his favourite 

 rag-doll or a familiar corner of his pillow until he falls 

 asleep. 

 If Akbar?s case appears hopeless, 

 there is also Shubhash in Kharagpur, almost twelve, with 

 an incredibly melancholy face, whose aversion to dendrite 

 is passionately moral. He has resisted addiction, hates 

 the sharp smell of dendrite, and beats up his little brother 

 when he catches him at it, but is also now beginning to 

 give up on him. Perhaps this aversion has something to do 

 with the fact that he has studied upto class V, and there 

 are his mother (deserted by her husband for another woman) 

 and three sisters at home. He has married off one of the 

 girls recently, spending Rs 8,000 from his savings. And 

 there is Sooraj too, in Asansol station, with a shaven head 

 and a tikki, not older than eight, who has run away 

 from a beauty parlour in Bihar, and therefore brags of his 

 bleaching and threading skills. He is addicted not only 

 to dendrite, but also to telling ?kissas?, carrying 

 around in his head a wealth of hilarious Bhojpuri tales, 

 most of which are about a ?Biramhan?, his ?Biramhani? 

 and their mad, but holy cow. Sooraj briskly let me know 

 the other day that he has supplemented his sweeping with 

 some begging, and has also cut down on his glue-sniffing, 

 because he has to raise an additional 800 rupees for the 

 memorial rites of his father, who died last year of a burst 

 liver. There is almost unanimous agreement among the children 

 that saving money is crucial, and they usually cooperate 

 enthusiastically in any effort to help them do so in a more 

 organized way. But there are no government-run detoxification 

 centres which the children might go to, and the private 

 ones are entirely beyond their means and do not usually 

 treat glue-sniffing. This is all the more unfortunate since 

 many of the children genuinely want to get rid of their 

 addiction, and will give you a full and graphic list of 

 the withdrawal symptoms they have experienced when trying 

 to rid themselves of the habit unassisted.

 Sooraj?s manner is a puzzling 

 mix of the brisk and unsentimental, an infectiously camp 

 drollery, together with an entirely child-like hunger for 

 physically expressed affection, for being held, hugged or 

 given a lap to sit on. These he would extract unabashedly 

 from any adult who succumbs to his stories, sketches or 

 comic charm. As a result, he makes even the most careful 

 volunteer feel free and demonstrative while talking to him, 

 sometimes egging the person on to massage his back, the 

 aches in which he describes with an old hypochondriac?s 

 vividness, with exaggerated groans and sighs, delightfully 

 caricaturing his own self-pity. And if the volunteer does 

 feel free enough to give his back a little rub-down, Sooraj 

 would turn around archly and warn him that he had no money 

 to spare for the services rendered. 

 How is one, then, to describe 

 this child?s relationship with his own life, body, work 

 and surroundings? Yes, there is an extreme and fundamental 

 vulnerability. But it is also impossible to overlook, or 

 to not marvel at and respond to, what he has managed to 

 wrest for himself from this radically threatening and disempowering 

 environment. To overlook this, or to see it as pure damage, 

 would be to deny him almost as much as what he has already 

 been deprived of. Yet to romanticize this, to see this way 

 of life in utopian or sentimental terms, turning the child 

 into some sort of a victim-hero, a Lord of the Flies, would 

 also be deeply perverse ? although the temptation to do 

 so is more compelling than most of us would admit. 

 After all, if we remember and 

 think back honestly to our own earliest years, then we would 

 have to admit that running away from home, being heroic 

 victims of parental tyranny, and even being kidnapped, orphaned 

 or sold to the gypsies or a travelling circus, and mixed 

 in with all this the irresistible holiday-romance of the 

 railways, of ?a painted station whistling by?, are the stuff 

 not only of immortal children?s literature (Enid Blyton, 

 J.M. Barrie, Leela Majumdar, Satyajit Ray) but also of almost 

 every respectable and educated child?s wishes, fantasies 

 and lies. This is a vision of escape and freedom, of doing 

 exactly as one wishes with one?s friends and peers, of a 

 communal life outside the patrolled borders of the safe, 

 the secure and the settled, which perhaps does not go away 

 entirely even after we have grown up. It flows unconsciously 

 into our deepest anxieties, compulsions and sympathies as 

 adults, adding to something as abstract-sounding as, say, 

 our sense of social justice, or to our gut-level responses 

 to unfairness, cruelty or victimhood, a mysterious and complex 

 dimension that we might be loth to confront consciously. 

 There are laws, policies and conventions 

 about children and their rights, which every child-worker 

 will have to know, think critically about and work with 

 or against. But there is this thing too ? internalized by 

 the individual, yet collectively held ? informing his work 

 with children, and his own sense of the private and public 

 significance of this work. And the discourses of law, policy 

 and rights cannot always accommodate or provide a language 

 for articulating this dimension. 

 It remains, therefore, one of 

 the many human challenges posed by the railway children 

 in the lives of those who choose to work with them: not 

 only to confront and tap into the origins of their desire 

 to get involved with the children?s brutal, yet peculiarly 

 alluring lives of freedom and danger, and to do so honestly, 

 constructively and creatively, but also to guard against 

 the perils and excesses of such empathies and energies. 

 It is sometimes tempting to forget that the railway children 

 are not going to remain children forever. The only way to 

 resist this temptation is to inform our perception of their 

 lives with a relentlessly clear-sighted, unsentimental and 

 pragmatic sense of the determining actualities. This will 

 inevitably take us far beyond what most of us have done, 

 seen, feared, known and imagined as children.

 Hero and victim: these are the 

 two extreme poles of a doubleness that structures the position 

 and perception of these children in the eyes of civil society, 

 and in the discourses of law and of the state. Heart-rendingly 

 vulnerable, yet threateningly precocious, they remain poised 

 between freedom and entrapment, liberation and confinement, 

 destitution and delinquency; and in the eyes of the law 

 and the state, between innocence and criminality, protection 

 and punishment, welfare and rights. This doubleness is played 

 out every day in their interactions with figures of authority, 

 those who embody ?law and order? on the railway premises 

 and the trains ? mainly, the Railway Protection Force. Although 

 dangerously ambivalent, this evolving interaction is far 

 from being one of simple victimization.

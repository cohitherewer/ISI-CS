 MERRY GO ROUND

 The great fall

 The Big Over Easy: An investigation with the Nursery Crime Division By Jasper Fforde, Hodder and Stoughton, ? 6.90

 Detective Inspector Jack Spratt, who cannot bear a spot of fat on his plate, is the fittingly named head of Reading?s Nursery Crime Division, or NCD, as it is better known. But he is an unlikely hero, reticent, media-shy, even grumpy, threatened with the folding up of his beloved NCD and unable to impress his new junior who has just taken a transfer from Basingstoke to the Reading force, Mary Mary.

 Mary does not want to work under Spratt, whose highly publicized failure to convict the Three Pigs for the murder of Mr Wolff has made him a laughing-stock of the media. From the Reading Daily Eyestrain to The Gadfly, the newspapers love DCI Friedland Chymes ? magnetic, glamourous and eloquent ? whose exploits are recounted regularly by his favoured writer of the moment in the journal Amazing Crime Stories, and whose press conferences have the highest viewer ratings on television. Mary had wanted to work close to him since she was nine, and to become part of the exclusive Guild of Detectives of which he was the centre. 

 Equations within the Reading police force are dictated by mysterious directions from the guild, and Mary cannot believe it at first when she is told that she will be given a chance of membership if she manages to do a few favours for Chymes. The favours have to do with her first investigation under Spratt: the sudden death of Mr Humpty Dumpty after a fall from his favourite wall.

 Spratt and Mary rush around the countryside following up the few leads offered by the mysterious last days of the rich and sinister womanizer, while the innocent alien and the German princess in their division settle down to ?follow the money.? The grotesque suicide of his former wife deepens the mystery, as do the genetic experiments of the fanatical Dr Quatt of St Cerebellum?s Hospital. As if the parallel tensions of the investigation and Chymes? machinations are not enough, Spratt is burdened with a new personal, or domestic, worry. The new lodger in his house is Prometheus, beautiful, wise and unfailingly gentle, who makes no secret of his attraction to Spratt?s oldest daughter, twenty-year-old Pandora. Worse, Spratt?s wife thinks it is time he stopped feeling protective. The age difference between Pandora and her beau does not bother her mother. Through all this, Spratt is driven to distraction by excited telephone calls from his mother, as the beans Spratt had thrown out of her window begin growing at an incredible rate.

 Jason Fforde sweeps the reader along on a wave of hilarity, curiosity and mystification, with a tale that loses none of the thrill of the chase in the welter of satire, parody, crazy logic, intrigue and unbelieving laughter. Neither is there any lessening of real horror and fear, especially when the nature, power and real target of the sinister murderer become clear. The dizzying events are counterbalanced by the tussle between ethics and professional ambition in Mary?s mind and the gradual emergence of the true hero. It seems as though Fforde will never be able to bring all the threads of his complicated plot together. So the perfection of the climax provides unique aesthetic pleasure, the sigh of relief and satisfaction mingled with uncontrollable laughter. This is true cult material. True love too, is given its due place. Prometheus and Pandora, the idealists, will marry and try to change the propensities of the world. The young Pandora will undo what the old Pandora did. But to marry her, Spratt demands, Prometheus must give up his immortality.

 THE MORE THE MERRIER

 Gwynne Dyer

 The Japanese have known it was coming for years, but it arrived sooner than expected. The Japanese population has gone into absolute decline, and there will be at least 60,000 fewer Japanese at the end of this year than there were last January. 

 It?s the same elsewhere in east Asia. Last week, the National Statistical Office in Seoul announced that South Korea?s total fertility rate has plummeted to 1.16, lower than Japan?s. China?s looks better at 1.7, but that is deceptive because there is a 15 per cent surplus of boys over girls in the youngest population groups. All these countries? populations will start falling steeply over the next generation.

 The obvious explanation is that the east Asian countries, as they turn into fully developed societies, are following the path travelled by the European countries. Italy now has a total fertility rate of only 1.4, and Russia 1.3. If these trends persist, there will 15 million fewer Italians by mid-century, and 40 million fewer Russians. But the obvious explanation is probably wrong, as not all developed countries have collapsing birth-rates.

 Look at the French

 The average fertility rate in France (the most striking example) is 1.9. But that is not enough to keep the population stable over the long term, as the ?replacement? rate is 2.2, close enough to the replacement level that a relatively small flow of immigrants gua-rantees. The French population, close to 60 million, is expected to grow to 63.5 million in 2025. So what are the French doing right?

 France and Japan are both fully industrialized, urbanized, well-educated countries with generous social services. They are places where it is expensive to have children. And both have experienced extreme fluctuations in birth-rates in response to changing conditions.

 Japan?s population almost doubled, from 70 to 125 million, in the half-century after 1945. If the trend persists, it will be back down to 70 million before the end of this century. France?s population, by contrast, was already 40 million in 1840, but it stopped growing, mainly because it remained a largely rural country and generations of farmers limited their children in order to keep the land together. Then the rapid post-war urbanization of France ended the obsession with land, and in the past half-century the population has grown from 40 to 60 million. It is still growing, albeit slowly. Why?

 About independence

 The biggest difference between France and Japan is the status of women. Japanese women have a low status in the family, and they have a low status in the workforce (which they are expected to leave after they marry). As a result, the average age of Japanese women at marriage is going up by several months each year, and the birth-rate has collapsed.

 In France the traditional male-dominated family is all but dead ? almost half of all French children are born ?out of wedlock? ? but informal styles of family-living give women more control over their lives while still providing secure environments for most children. And the main thing women do with their freedom is stay in the workforce. It?s not just about money; it?s about independence and satisfaction with one?s life. 

 The French government helps its female citizens with free child-care, subsidized vacation camps during school holidays, and tax breaks and allowances for bigger families. Other countries do the same but with much less success. The three-child family is still the norm among the French middle class because French women do not feel they must choose between motherhood and a life outside the house. The lesson: if you don?t want your country?s population to fluctuate like a yo-yo, pay attention to women?s status inside and outside the family.

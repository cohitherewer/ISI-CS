 AT A TURN

 The Congress in Bengal is better known as a divided house. The show of unity that the party put up at a rally on Saturday can, therefore, boost the sagging morale of the party?s cadre. That the party could organize such a rally in Calcutta after 20 long years symbolizes a hope and, possibly a new resolve. For nearly 30 years that the Congress has been out of power in the state, hopelessness and cynicism marked its political culture. And the endless rivalries among its leaders made things look even more bleak for the party. The Congress, it seemed, was both unwilling and unable to rise from the ruins. Ms Mamata Banerjee?s exit from it was the culmination of that process of disintegration. It was not as though the Left Front?s rule had not offered the party new challenges to regroup and re-emerge as a major political force. But, whenever such opportunities arose, it was Ms Banerjee?s Trinamool Congress, rather than its parent party, that sought to make use of them. The Congress could only play second fiddle to her. Or the leaders were busy with their own little games of one-upmanship.

 However, the Congress needs to work out a strategy in order to sustain the momentum. It is incidental that the arrest of its member of parliament, Mr Adhir Chowdhury, brought most factions of the party together. But, it will need to rally itself round a larger cause if it is to make Saturday?s show a real turning point. It has several factors in its favour. The return of the Congress to power in New Delhi is the most important of them. Even if the United Progressive Alliance government has to depend on the left?s support, the left and the Congress have no choice but to fight it out in Bengal, Kerala or Tripura. It should be in the interests of the Congress?s national strategy to try and weaken the left in the latter?s strongholds. Second, Ms Banerjee never looked as vulnerable as she does now. She has suffered major electoral defeats since the Lok Sabha polls last year. Several of her former lieutenants, such as the former Calcutta mayor, Mr Subrata Mukherjee, and Mr Sudip Bandyopadhyay, are back in the Congress. As the last parliamentary polls showed, some sections of the traditional Congress votes, such as the Muslims, have started returning to the Congress. It is too early to guess how a revived Congress would fare in next year?s assembly elections in Bengal. But the party can regain its credibility and relevance if it seriously works on the new opportunities.

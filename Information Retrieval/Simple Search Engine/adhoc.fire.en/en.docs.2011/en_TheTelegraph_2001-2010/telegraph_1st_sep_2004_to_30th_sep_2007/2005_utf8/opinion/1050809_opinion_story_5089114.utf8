 Letters to Editor

 Here are the facts

 Sir ? I was surprised to see a report in The Telegraph of August 3, under the heading, ?Bid to soften nuclear critics?. The report is factually incorrect on many counts.

 The meeting referred to in the report was not convened or sought by the prime minister?s office. The initiative for this meeting came from the Indo-US parliamentary forum. The forum invited the national security adviser, M.K. Narayanan, the former convener of the national security advisory board, K. Subrahmanyam, and the former chairman of the atomic energy regulatory board, A. Gopalakrishnan, to address its members on the Indo-US joint statement and its various elements. Since the NSA was unable to attend the meeting, as he was in a meeting between the prime minister and the king of Bhutan, I went to the meeting to express his regrets and to be available for any questions from the members of the forum on the statement. No official of the PMO, including myself, took any initiative in organizing this meeting. Both Subrahmanyam and Gopalakrishnan spoke in their individual, non-official capacity. The PMO did not circulate any material at the meeting. However, a background document prepared for the media and available on the PMO website was circulated by the IUPF to its members. 

 Given these facts, the report, in particular its headline, is misleading.

 Yours faithfully,

Sanjaya Baru, Media Adviser to PM, New Delhi 

 Battle-lines drawn

 Sir ? The increasing Naxalite activities in West Bengal have become a serious concern for the Left Front government. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) leaders have started issuing statements left right and centre, contradicting themselves frequently. The Naxalites are very clear about their ?class struggle?: they fight for the development of the poorest of the poor, and for their right to a dignified life. But the secretary of the state CPI(M), Anil Biswas, thinks the unprecedented development work undertaken by the party in the villages has infuriated the Maoists. It does not take a lot of intelligence to figure out who is telling the truth. 

 The Naxalites have made the ruling communists even more edgy by inviting them to an open ideological debate. Evidently, Biswas and his party are not up to the challenge. This can easily be interpreted as the Marxist government?s unwillingness to restore peace in its western districts. The CPI(M) is also reaping the benefits of the unrest, because in the name of anti-Naxalite operations, they are carrying out repressive action on innocent villagers as well as on their political opponents. The Naxalites claim that the recent killings in Bankura and Purulia were because the killed individuals were acting as informers of the police, and not because of their political colour. But the CPI(M) tries to make martyrs of those killed, claiming that they were CPI(M) workers. 

 The anti-Naxal operations of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s police reminds one of the old style of the Congress chief minister of the Seventies, Siddhartha Shankar Ray. It seems that young ?Siddhartha? of the Seventies has matured into the ?Buddha? of 2005. We wish the new millennium does not have to witness a repeat of the Seventies. Many non-Marxist chief ministers have done much for their states in a very short time, while the Marxists in West Bengal have only managed to push the state backward in all spheres after enjoying 27 years in power. Unless some basic development programmes are initiated in the remote areas of the state, much more bloodletting awaits its people.

 Yours faithfully,

Tridib Roy, Calcutta

 Sir ? Although Maoist violence is yet to spin out of control in West Bengal, the extent to which the Maoists can go in spreading terror is there for all to see in some other states. With these instances in front of it, it would seem judicious on the part of the West Bengal government to hold talks with them and try and resolve the situation at the earliest. It is therefore quite baffling to see the CPI(M) government refuse to take that route. It is very easy for the state CPI(M) secretary to sit safely nestled in his Alimuddin street office and say that ?they [the Maoists] have taken the path of violence?, but this has now begun to sound like a lame excuse for not starting the talks. Our communist leaders accuse the rebels of misguiding the people with a distorted theory of Maoism, but could they explain why the villagers are getting ?misguided? so easily? 

 The Marxists are forgetting a basic lesson in their own bible, that a revolution is always born out of injustice. It is clear that the Maoists are working with the support of the villagers. It is also hardly surprising that local CPI(M) leaders and workers ? part of the corrupt nexus between the ruling party and the bureaucracy ? are becoming their chief targets. Funds meant for the infrastructural development of these areas mostly find their way into the pockets of the leaders and bureaucrats. How, otherwise, can one account for the extraordinary backwardness of the villages where Maoists are most active? Instead of commenting on the faulty ideology of the Maoists, the government might consider negotiation and developmental work to diffuse the crisis.

 Yours faithfully,

Sarit Ray, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The report, ?Maoists mean hopes for hungry families? (July 16), spells out the truth though the Left Front government of West Bengal will beg to differ. Basic amenities like food, drinking water, irrigation, healthcare and education have been denied to several villages of West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia for very long. The so- called pro-poor government and party have systematically ignored the poor. This gap has been, to some extent, filled up by the Maoists. As a result, they have had no difficulties in earning the support of the people.

 Yours faithfully, 

Sudarsan Nandi, Midnapore 

 Sir ? The growing Naxal menace in Orissa, especially in the west, is serious. The chief minister, Naveen Patnaik, should consult Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, which has dealt with the problem for a long time. Simultaneously, the Union home ministry should be asked to send more trained troops to the forests of Koraput, Malkangiri and Sambalpur.

 Yours faithfully,

R. Sekar, Angul, Orissa

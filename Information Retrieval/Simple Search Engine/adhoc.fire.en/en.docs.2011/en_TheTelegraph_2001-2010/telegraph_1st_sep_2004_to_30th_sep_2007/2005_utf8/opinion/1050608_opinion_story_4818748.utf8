 Letters to Editor

 A matter of choice

 Sir ? One perhaps would be stating the obvious if one were to say that Dimple Eric is perfectly right in seeking court intervention to escape the emotional blackmail by her biological parents (?Dumped at birth, claimed in youth?, June 6). Left to die in a garbage dump some three decades ago, Dimple was doubly lucky ? first to have got away from the jaws of death, and then to have been brought up by a loving family that fulfilled her every need. Perhaps even her own sister has not been so lucky. Unfortunately, we know nothing of her, just as we know nothing of the millions of other girls lucky enough to be brought up by their biological parents but unlucky enough to have been forced to marry against their choice. We need to look beyond successes like Dimple and judicially empower women against nagging parents.

 Yours faithfully,

 L. Chandrasekhar, Calcutta

 Tall tales

 Sir ? It is unfortunate that The Telegraph decided to publicize the allegation that an Indian army brigadier sold an army plan to Pakistan during the 1965 war (?Indian hero in Gohar?s sights?, June 1). The fact that the allegation has been made by the son of the former Pakistan commander-in-chief of the army, General Mohammed Ayub Khan, does not necessarily make it a credible one. Such insinuations are likely to adversely affect public perception of our armed forces. These allegations are always difficult to prove and a lot of time has already passed since the incident supposedly took place. It is improbable that similar allegations against a Pakistani would have got much coverage in Pakistan, given the limited freedom its press enjoys. This underlines the responsibility of the Indian press to exercise its freedom with caution. The reputation of various brigadiers of that time has been called into question. The Pakistani mandarins who have always beaten India in the media and public relations arena would be delighted when they realize the extent of confusion they have caused in India with just one loose allegation.

 Yours faithfully,

Srijit Basu, Calcutta

 Sir ? India could not have been drawing up plans to attack Pakistan eight years before the 1965 war. Does Gohar Ayub Khan want to prove that India is guilty of starting the offensive? But the matter can be read from the opposite perspective as well ? that it was the Pakistanis who were trying to buy the plans from Indian military officials. Another thing. Could any brigadier have been so gullible as to have sold a sensitive document for such a meagre sum of money? Gohar Khan does not realize that his allegation points a finger at the integrity of his own father and country. Were the past leaders of Pakistan such fools that they depended on an eight-year-old plan to fight a war with India in 1965? 

 Besides, does Khan wish to show his father as a morally decrepit person who had to buy plans from the enemy country to shield the weak Pakistani army? The Pakistan government and Ayub Khan himself preferred not to disclose the name of the brigadier on what can be presumed to be moral grounds. Even if Ayub Khan had committed a crime, he had done it for the sake of his country. Then why is his son blowing the cover? Is it to ensure the sale of a few thousand more copies of his book? The Indian defence minister is right to order a probe. There should be no doubts in the minds of the Indian public about their armymen. 

 Yours faithfully,

Govinda Das Dujari, Calcutta

 Sir ? The fact that there was an eight-year gap between the sale of the army?s plan and the war to break out does not mean that Gohar Ayub Khan is lying. It also does not prove the innocence of the Indian brigadier. We must keep in mind that Germany made its plans for World War II in the Twenties, years before the actual crisis. Similarly, the Russians started making their plans for Cuban missiles six years in advance. We should first set our own house in order before questioning the enemy.

 Yours faithfully,

Rimli Dutta, Calcutta

 Sir ? The revelations by a former minister of Pakistan and the son of the general who fought the 1965 war with India is shocking. Even more shocking than the allegation that army plans had been sold by an Indian brigadier is the fact that he chose to sell them to finance his wife?s hobby of ?canning fruits and vegetables?. The revelation also casts a shadow on our secret security plans.

 Yours faithfully,

R. Sekar, Angul 

 Sir ? Gohar Ayub Khan?s disclosure about the war deal after 40 years should be completely ignored as it is baseless and lacks evidence. It should be only considered as a cheap stunt to make his book popular. I am pained to know that the Indian government has asked for an inquiry into the issue. We should understand that the Indian army is amongst the best in the world and has made supreme sacrifices at the time of war and during national crises. I strongly believe that Gohar Khan?s is a fabricated story. Even if his claims were to be accepted, Khan should realize that he has only helped bring more disgrace to his country by them. 

 Yours faithfully,

S.P. Sharma, Mumbai

 Sunny side

 Sir ? The report, ?Kalam gives co-travellers a testing time? (June 3), reveals both the gritty and the cheerful side of the Indian president, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam. The country?s media have spent reams of paper pointing out how outr? his hair-cut is. But the fact is that this man is more out-of-the-box than anyone could ever imagine. An advocate of India?s nuclear empowerment, Kalam encourages the inquisitive mind. Hence the task he set his entourage ? prepare a note on what the members had learnt in Ukraine and what they could do to improve India?s interests in the region. The report also showed his funny streak. For anyone else, it would have been unbecoming to stop a serious discussion midway and ask for a musical break. Not for Kalam. Those who know him would say that he was at his unusual best.

 Yours faithfully,

Sharmistha Dhar, Calcutta

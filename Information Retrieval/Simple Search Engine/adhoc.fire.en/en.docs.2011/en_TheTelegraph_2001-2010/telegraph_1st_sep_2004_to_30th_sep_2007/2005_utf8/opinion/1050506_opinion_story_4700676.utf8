 SOMEONE REALLY CARES

 Serving the Nation: Cultures of Service, Association, and Citizenship in Colonial India 

 By Carey Anthony Watt,

 Oxford, Rs 595

 This book takes us back to social service and associational activities of the early 20th century. Carey Watt does not indicate that there is a direct relationship between such practices in the contemporary period and those around 1910, but he sees some continuity. For one, public action then and public action now remain constrained by sectional politics and primordial considerations.

 The beginning of the previous century witnessed the proliferation of organizations dedicated to social service and constructive public work in north India and other parts of the subcontinent. They were taking over the control of highly visible arenas of national life like education, management of melas and festivals and providing relief during famines, plague, cholera and so on. The British rulers were, to a certain extent, happy to devolve a limited measure of power into Indian hands, especially when it came to finding money to pay for public services. Philanthropic initiatives were undertaken by organizations like the Arya Samaj, the Servants of India Society, the Theosophical Society and others manned by upper and middle class urban elites. 

 Social work, Watt argues, exemplified a complex interface of tradition and modernity in colonial India. Watt argues that in the north, social initiatives drew upon deep-rooted traditions while also being influenced by contemporary social conditions and global development. The concepts of dana, seva, karmayoga, and brahmacharya found expression in social service efforts and the culture of association. Watt says that just because Indian social service activities were influenced by Western discourses, it does not mean that one should ignore the reality or ?given-ness?. One has to acknowledge the way in which living tradition intertwined with local, colonial or global forces. 

 There was a worldwide interest in citizenship training at the beginning of the 20th century and Indians were very much a part of the global trend together with China, Japan, the US and the UK. The modern notion of citizenship emphasized duties, obligations and discipline. 

 A wide variety of social service activities brought new social groups into public life. They increased the number of institutions and associational networks and energized the north Indian society with notions of selfless service. All these resulted in a growing assertion of Indian control over an emergent civil society. Nation-building in this sense did not clash with the raj, but it gradually eroded colonial authority. This book systematically analyses the relationship between charity, service, association activities and politics at the turn of the 20th century. It will be of interest to scholars working in the NGO sector and for the civil society in general.

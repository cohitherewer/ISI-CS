 WON?T WORK

 Those who cannot win arguments throw tantrums. For anarchists and other rebels, this can mean violence and the threats of it. With its 26-year-old armed struggle for a ?sovereign? Assam heading nowhere, all that the United Liberation Front of Asom can do is continue with acts and threats of terror. Its latest diktat, though, is somewhat different; it almost borders on the absurd. By ?banning? the leaders of all national political parties from visiting Assam to address rallies there, the outfit has exposed the bankruptcy of its ideas and strategies. Obviously, it does not expect the diktat to be obeyed. Even if it manages to disrupt any such rally, that would not stop the national leaders from visiting the state. In fact, the history of the ULFA?s violence also shows how powerless it has been to destabilize democracy. There is only one plausible explanation as to why the group has issued the fatwa that neither the people nor the parties would take seriously. Clearly, the bluster is a veiled attempt to force issues in the event of peace talks between it and the government. It is a pathetic ploy anyway and simply cannot work.

 Even so, the government cannot afford to lower its guard. The diktat comes against the backdrop of not only the possible peace talks, but also the state assembly elections early next year. It is safe to assume that the rebels will mount a fresh offensive in order to disrupt the polls if the talks do not begin before them. Their aim will be to terrorize the people and thereby disrupt the democratic process. This is the fine print in the ULFA?s ?appeal? to the people to ?shun national political parties and the political system once and for all.? This is not the first time that the ULFA has asked the people to reject the democratic political system. But the people have always responded by rejecting the ULFA?s creed of violence and secessionism. Even its ethnic chauvinism, that seeks to make a distinction between national and local parties, has not been able to mislead the people. To the Assamese, the ULFA?s politics of the gun has meant blood and terror. Even a flawed democracy is an infinitely better choice. The chief minister, Mr Tarun Gogoi, will be right in trying to persuade the rebels to start a dialogue. But the government must make it clear to the rebels that democracy and the rule of law are not negotiable.

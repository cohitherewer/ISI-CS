 NEW TERMS

 In an ideal world, a debate over conflicting principles may have direct bearing on reality. But the Indian prison is rather too far from the ideal world. The debate over whether a life sentence means imprisonment coeval with the prisoner?s physical life or coeval with the conventional term of 14 years is a perfectly reasonable one. Yet its outcome, whatever it may be, would have to be applied to a world where reason is hardly the most prominent feature. But even in the arena of reason, where laws are propounded, there always has been a slight indecisiveness about the life sentence. The Supreme Court has said quite clearly that a life sentence means imprisonment for life and not for 14 years. The jail code says that an advisory committee may forward a lifer?s name for release after 14 or more years on the basis of good conduct. The question has been complicated from the very beginning, with the Indian penal code suggesting life, 14 years, 20 years and not less than 16 to 19 years for a life sentence. The growing practice of releasing lifers after seven years led to the criminal procedure code amendment of 1978, which said that a life term should be at least 14 years. Releasing lifers on various occasions, especially elderly people who have served a fraction of their sentences, is common enough. It is also common to use good behaviour as a reason for early release, with the inevitable result that prisoners with the right connections may manage to get away sooner than the others.

 It is the government that must first move to ensure the early release of a prisoner. Given the close connections of the political world with the criminal underworld, it cannot be said that there have been adequate checks and balances to ensure perfect disinterestedness on the part of the government in every case so far. The less than ideal world of the prison complicates the issue further. As long as there is no guarantee that the rights of all prisoners, their right to food, to health and hygiene, would be granted them, whether they are in for life or for a limited time, the debate cannot be completely freed of considerations beyond the abstract. The prison system needs review, perhaps not the system as it is set down in black and white, but as it is executed daily everywhere. Without a serious drive against discrimination, corruption, ill-treatment and secret power hierarchies in Indian prisons, the field for arguments over principle is not fully prepared.

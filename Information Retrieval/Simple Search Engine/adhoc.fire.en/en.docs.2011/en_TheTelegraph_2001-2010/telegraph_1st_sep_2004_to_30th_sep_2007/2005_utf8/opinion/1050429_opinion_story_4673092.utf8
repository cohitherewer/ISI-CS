 TROUBLE IN PARADISE

 A people mourns

 Forget Kathmandu: An Elegy for Democracy 

 By Manjushree Thapa, 

 Penguin, Rs 350

 For a long time, the only international news that Nepal made had to do with Mount Everest ? the triumphs on the world?s highest mountain, the tragedies and the accompanying controversies. It was an idyllic land where foreigners went to climb the magnificent Himalayan peaks, to trek to the hidden valleys and to savour the charms and challenges of other adventure sports. To the West, the people of Nepal generally meant the sherpas who helped the sahibs climb the mountains. 

 All that changed on June 1, 2001 when an entire line of Nepal?s ruling dynasty was wiped out in the massacre at Kathmandu?s Narayanhiti Palace. For a world afflicted with the dreadful burden of sameness, the palace mayhem in a far-off, mountainous eastern kingdom was almost like a mystical journey back into medieval times when kings and queens were always being killed off in their dark castles in the most mysterious of manners. 

 While the world almost revelled in the rediscovery of an ancient world, the royal massacre in Kathmandu shocked and stunned the Nepalese in a way that no other event in the country?s modern history had done. Manjushree Thapa?s book is essentially an account of the Nepali society?s attempts to come to terms with the anguish and bewilderment at the collapse of their old, familiar world. 

 The book is a sensitive mix of different styles, in which history, reportage, political travelogue and memoir merge. It is easy to see that Thapa is no ordinary Nepalese. Her upper-class life was pretty much centred around Kathmandu. It was a life sheltered from the rough winds blowing from the far corners of the kingdom where grinding poverty and centuries-old social customs prevailed. 

 It was not as if the alarm bells were not ringing even before the palace tragedy. Since 1996, most of the country was literally besieged by the Maoist rebels. Several thousands of people perished on both sides of the battlelines. The Maoist offensives provoked brutal state repression that claimed the lives of hundreds of innocent civilians. In the sanitized world of Kathmandu, rich kids still drove brand new cars and ate languid dinners at posh restaurants. Lovely ladies still hung out at art salons. 

 That was the Kathmandu that Thapa ? and others like her ? has been forced to forget. Out she goes now into the streets ? to the history museum ? to know of the country?s past and reflect on it. But it is still Kathmandu and she must venture further out. So off she goes to the mountainous western districts to confront the present that is dominated by the Maoist rebellion. 

 The confrontation with the present makes her look back also at the country?s painful experiments with what she calls ?postmodern democracy?. One does not expect the book to offer unusual political insights or an analyst?s view of what went wrong with the fledgling democracy. But the author captures the country?s deep disappointment with the failures of the main parties such as the Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist). 

 It is, however, Thapa?s journey to the Maoist-controlled areas that makes for some of the most sensitive accounts. The simple narrative comes alive with a sense of agony at the huge injustices of a system that sent young boys and girls to their cruel deaths. Thapa?s ?elegy? for Nepal could have struck an even sadder note if she had written it after King Gyanendra?s latest coup.

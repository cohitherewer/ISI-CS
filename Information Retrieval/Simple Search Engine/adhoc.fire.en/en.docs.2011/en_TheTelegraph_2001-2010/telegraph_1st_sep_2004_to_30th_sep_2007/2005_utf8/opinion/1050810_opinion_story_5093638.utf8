 VIEW FROM THE COCKPIT

 Abhijit Bhattacharyya

 Just visualize this. An Air India Boeing, manufactured in 1992 and leased from South Korea, takes off early one morning from Bangalore for Chicago, in full Indian monsoon, with 335 passengers on board. The aircraft?s weight, for the first leg of the flight till Mumbai, is unlikely to be more than 305 tons, the maximum landing weight being not more than 295 tons. The weight of an aircraft in flight decreases because of fuel consumption. Add to this the further loss of weight from circling or ?holding? in aviation jargon. 

 In this case, when the aircraft neared Mumbai, the pilot, hamstrung by a three-hour delay, found the weather gods playing truant. Poor visibility, high-velocity wind and waterlogged runway apart, the pilot had to negotiate the most tricky of all flight paths ? the approach to Mumbai?s runway 14-32. With a hillock coming in the line of sight of the pilot, even at the best of times this runway is difficult to negotiate. It requires experienced hands and the head firmly in place.

 What makes matters worse for the pilot is the agony of ?holding? and the clinical accuracy required thereafter to safely negotiate and touch down on a runway much smaller than usual. Any error is bound to be fatal. Along with these risks, heed the state of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Airport in the monsoon. In other words, it is a nightmarish situation, the existence of sophisticated equipment and systems notwithstanding.

 Violent cells

 Of all the four metro airports, Mumbai?s is undoubtedly the worst during the monsoon. With dangerously jutting slums flanking the twin runways, canines on the tarmac, the unpredictable wind shear, the Western Ghat?s famous winds, the slippery subsidiary runway, coupled with the tricky approach and strong tail ? everything can mess up the flier?s plans. In fact, if one goes through the records of the Mumbai airport, one will come across several ?incidents? similar to the one that happened that fateful July 30, 2005, occurring during monsoon.

 In this connection, this author may be forgiven for recounting his experience as a ?special? guest on an Indian Airlines Calcutta-Mumbai flight (IC 273) on October 7, 1999. The weight of the aircraft had already been reduced by almost 10 tons by the time it was over Aurangabad, prior to its descent. Although the Mumbai control and the cockpit radar clearly indicated the existence of a violent ?cell? of cumulo-nimbus clouds accompanied by thunderstorm and gale, wisdom dawned only after a traumatic rolling and pitching. 

 Change, and fast

 Following this, the sturdy Airbus was compelled to divert to Hyderabad with 240 passengers on board. The decision, quite obviously, should have been taken earlier. But had the IC-273 attempted to go through the lightning, wind, thunder, invisibility, wind shear and so on and landed in Mumbai, it would have faced the same fate as the Air India Boeing did.

 From all accounts, the incident at the Mumbai airport appears to have been pilot error. The question that should be asked is, was the error avoidable or unavoidable? Can any one factor be responsible for an air mishap or incident? 

 Perhaps not. The history of aviation disasters shows that it is a combination of factors which culminates in accidents. The Air India Boeing?s faulty landing in Mumbai also does not seem to be an exception. Monsoon Mumbai needs better facilities and drastic changes in overall airport operations. Location, weather and navigation aids, all together, appear to have contributed to the error in judgment. The captain is only the last factor in the chain of events. Unfortunately, the buck will be made to stop here. Which is all the more reason why the changes have to be made.

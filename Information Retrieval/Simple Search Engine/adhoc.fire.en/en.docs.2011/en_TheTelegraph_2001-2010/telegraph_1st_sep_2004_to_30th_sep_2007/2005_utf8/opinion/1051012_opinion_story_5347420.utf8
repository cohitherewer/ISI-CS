 Graft control

 Sir ? The CBI raid on Inspector Ishwar Singh has exposed the murky goings-on in the higher police administration (?Busted: Cricket scam-buster?, Oct 1). It is shocking that a gallantry-award winning senior police officer should be so corrupt. The raids put his achievements, especially the uncovering of the cricket betting scandal, under the scanner. Who knows, Singh may have been a part of the betting racket and implicated Hansie Cronje after they fell out? Was his unaccounted-for wealth the payment he received from the betting syndicate? Singh has not only earned a bad name for himself and his department, but has also put many honest officers under suspicion. It?s surprising that his seniors were unaware of his activities.

 It?s also a matter of concern that the media got wind of the raids before they took place. This is ominous and there is need for an investigation into the leak, if the CBI wants to avert a disaster in the future. If the raid had been contemplated on suspected militants, what would have been the repercussions of the goof-up? 

 Yours faithfully,

Bijoy Ranjan Dey, Tinsukia

 Sir ? The recent CBI raids on 70 government officers all across the country has been highlighted by the media and welcomed by the public. But has the CBI ever been able to touch a minister, or a legislator, at the state or Central level, leave alone raid their bungalows? Are we then supposed to believe that corruption in this country is only limited to lesser civil servants and petty officers? Corruption always travels down from the top and never the other way. But unfortunately the small fish are caught and humiliated periodically to fool the public while the bigger ones continue to swim in the murky waters. This is nothing but a travesty of justice.

 Yours faithfully,

S.K. Moitra, Calcutta

 Sir ? From time to time, the media reports on CBI raids on Central government employees. Surprisingly, there is hardly any information about similar action by the vigilance or anti-corruption wing at the state level. Is it that those controlling corruption in the states are inefficient? Or is the push and pull from politicians and senior bureaucrats more prominent at the state-level, providing protection to many corrupt officials? Are these two factors that have kept corruption alive at the panchayat level, which has deprived the poor of the benefits of development?

 Yours faithfully,

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? CBI raids on a few officers will not help check corruption in a country which ranks a poor 91 in Transparency International?s corruption-perception-index, with just 2.8 points out of 10. However, if the Indian government wishes to induce honesty in the system, there should be provision of stringent punishment for those involved in big scams. The property of the culprits and their near relations should be confiscated. Also steps must be taken to drastically reduce currency circulation in banking transactions. But will a legislature which itself patronizes corruption ever take these steps?

 Yours faithfully,

S.C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir ? The CBI raids, even if they were conducted with an eye on the forthcoming elections in Bihar, were good news. But for such raids to have any real meaning, the finance ministry should periodically publish or present in parliament the details of what was the total amount of cash and other assets seized, how much was released, what tax was recovered, the interest and penalty on it, as well as how many of the guilty were jailed and so on. 

 Yours faithfully,

Mahesh Kumar, New Delhi

 Sir ? If the government is serious about eliminating corruption, then it could consider the following course of action. All employees, whether in government or private offices, must be asked to confirm in an affidavit that they don?t accept bribes or support bribe-giving in any form in the course of their duties. The management should then post the names on the notice board. The next step would be to warn all customers that any attempt to bribe employees would be severely punished, far more stringently than the existing laws in this area ? which are anyway never taken seriously. 

 Alternatively, if the government thinks that corruption cannot be wiped out altogether, then the notice boards should indicate the bribery rates for individual jobs so that there is at least a semblance of control on the extent of corruption.

 Yours faithfully,

Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

 Chicken or egg? 

 Sir ? The Chhattisgarh high court?s order banning the unlicensed sale of eggs, after it held eggs to be non-vegetarian, is welcome (Eggs veg? They don?t grow on trees?, Oct 8). But much more needs to be done to respect the sentiments of the large vegetarian population in the country. Many restaurants serving non-vegetarian food in India become totally vegetarian during the Navratras to respect religious sentiments of most people, but how many food joints use separate hot-plates and kitchen-wares to cook both vegetarian and non-vegetarian food? The authorities must turn their attention to this matter. 

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Delhi

 Sir ? It seems as if India has already solved all its problems, the only remaining one being whether eggs are vegetarian or non-vegetarian. Though it does not require a botanist to know that eggs do not grow on plants, not even on the eggplant, the judiciary?s time perhaps can be better utilized to clear the backlog of cases. Malnutrition is the ?silent killer?. In a protein starved country like India, where Kalahandis and Aamlashols recur regularly, eggs can help provide nutrition to the poor as they are readily available, cheap, easily digestible and difficult to adulterate. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Taritwan Pal, Calcutta

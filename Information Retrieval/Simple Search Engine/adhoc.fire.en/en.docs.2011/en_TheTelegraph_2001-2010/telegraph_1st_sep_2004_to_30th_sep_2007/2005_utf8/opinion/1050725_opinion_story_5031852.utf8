 ROTTEN TO THE CORE 

 Gwynne Dyer

 If you are a politician, there are few more embarrassing experiences than to be caught at an airport with the equivalent of $100,000 stuffed into your underpants. Only one political gaffe has a higher embarrassment quotient: being tape-recorded on the phone to a senior electoral official, as the votes are being counted, asking him to boost your total.

 That is the problem that currently besets the Philippines president, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. The phone call was made over a year ago, when Arroyo squeaked back into the presidency with a majority of only a million votes, but the existence of the audio recording was made public by the ABS-CBN television network only last month.

 Arroyo?s office immediately released the tape of her election-day conversation with the election commissioner, Victoriano Garcellano, explaining that it involved ?the illegal bugging and subsequent electronic doctoring, alteration and revision of that conversation so as to introduce elements that were not really there?.

 Maybe the tape was re-edited and new elements spliced in, or maybe not, but at the very least Arroyo made the call. She has publicly apologized for her ?lapse of judgment?, but for a candidate to call up an election official in the middle of the count is not just a lapse of judgment; it is, in politics, a hanging offence. 

 Underwear trouble

 Contrast the curious case of the overstuffed underpants in Brazil. The garment in question belonged to Jose Vieira da Silva, a junior official in Brazil?s ruling Workers? Party (PT) who was stopped at Sao Paulo airport on July 9. It was the latest in a series of political disasters that began with the accusation early last month by Roberto Jefferson, leader of the small Labour Party, that the PT was handing out regular monthly payments (?mensalaos?), equivalent to $12,500, to a number of deputies in the Brazilian congress in order to get its legislation through. (The PT does not have a majority in Congress).

 The accusation came as a particular shock because President Luiz Inacio ?Lula? da Silva was widely seen as an incorruptible figure. Jefferson himself, while urging the PT?s chief of staff, Jose Dirceu, to take the blame and quit, exempted the president from his accusations: ?If you don?t get out of here quickly,? he told Dirceu, ?you are going to make a defendant out of an innocent man, President Lula.?

 Order of crime

 So Dirceu quit ? but then came the underpants episode this month, and the resignation of the president of the PT, Jose Genoino (whose politician brother employed the owner of the underpants). Suddenly Lula?s whole career, and all of the considerable good that he has achieved for Brazil?s poor, seemed to hang in balance.

 Yet Lula probably won?t go under, for there are varieties of corruption, and the particular kind that the PT has engaged in is almost traditional in Brazil. Lula?s performance in office has been sufficiently impressive to get him re-elected tomorrow if there were an election. Whereas President Arroyo?s performance in the Philippines has been a good deal less impressive, and she would not be re-elected.

 Trying to steal the presidency is more serious than trying to grease the skids to get some legislation through Congress. Moreover, constitutional order is a lot less stable in the Philippines, which has seen two presidents removed by street protests in the past 20 years. But the likeliest outcome is that Arroyo will hang on in office, widely discredited and fighting off endless impeachment proceedings, while her country?s economy and politics both go into a steep decline.

 ?Lapse of judgment? or deliberate bid to corrupt the election process ? it scarcely matters. If she were a patriot, she would resign and spare her country the ordeal that awaits it.

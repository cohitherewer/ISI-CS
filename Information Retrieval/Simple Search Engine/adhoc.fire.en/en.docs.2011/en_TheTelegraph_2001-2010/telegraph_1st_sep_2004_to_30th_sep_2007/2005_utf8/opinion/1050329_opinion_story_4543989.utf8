 TIME FOR A NEW VISION

 MALVIKA SINGH

 It may appear as relentless bureaucracy bashing in this column and therefore a predictable anti-babu diatribe, but we have no option when we find a majority of bureaucrats behaving in a manner that is wholly detrimental to positive change. It is becoming increasingly clear that a paradigm shift is imperative for India if it has to trigger change and rapid development. It is equally clear that those who control change are not willing to let go and allow that metamorphosis to happen. That club of administrators who can no longer cope with or control growth are trying everything in the book to stall all change that will dilute their stranglehold. Soon they will run for cover to protect themselves and their increasing ineptitude. 

 This reality is staring us in the face. An example: the Congress has not been in power at the Centre for many years. The bureaucrats in control for the last six to eight years have been alienated from the austerity and ethos of the Manmohan Singh government that is in sharp contrast to the extravagance of the upwardly mobile political dispensation before it. The senior babus today are ?loyal? to the last lot in power. In their desperation to uphold their power, these administrators are weaving intricate webs around the ruling politicians of today, misusing their trust and misleading them into irretrievable situations. Good, honest, honourable men and women, a new breed of elected representatives, are being manipulated by wily, seasoned babus who are terrified of losing their hold over political leaders. If they do lose, by the grace of god, the corruption and despicable practices we have all been victims of will cease and dignity will raise its head.

 Poor cats

 Political leaders should be able to assess this terrible virus that has overtaken governance. The tiger scandal continues unabated despite the forceful intervention of the prime minister. How and why? The ministry, in a heroic attempt to cover its dreadful incompetence, its guilt, bangs away at those who exposed the criminality, calling them ?emotional? and therefore without any empirical back-up. How absolutely wrong they are. The prime minister should reject their plea outright. Such bureaucrats must be banished. They and their shenanigans must not be entertained. They have been caught with their pants down. Sariska is not an exaggeration. The babus in the ministry cannot deal with this emergency because they are incapable of admitting that they are not the experts, they are mere babus who move from one ministry to another to push files. They must draw in the experts and trust them, not alienate and antagonize them. 

 Today, despite the concern of the PMO, the ministry of environment is busy trying to scuttle the prime minister?s call for a tiger task force with members from the outside world of passionate ?experts?. It is running scared of being exposed further. Reports filtering in from the Panna Tiger Reserve in Madhya Pradesh show that forest department officials are fudging the census and claiming 34 tigers when in fact poaching here has been as severe as in Sariska. The sense is that there are less than 10 left. Very shortly, another Sariska type scandal will hit the world as senior ministry officials waffle on, mocking the passion of NGOs which have devoted their lives to the protection of forests and wildlife. And, we all know, there is much money to be made in the illegal dismantling of our remaining forests!

 The time has come to wield the whip and the UPA must put its trusted lieutenants in place rather than be betrayed by those who do not share the new vision and the ?austerity?. If the government is to deliver the goods as promised in the common minimum programme and joint manifesto, it must have a team of committed administrators, not a team that was loyal to the ?vision? of the NDA.

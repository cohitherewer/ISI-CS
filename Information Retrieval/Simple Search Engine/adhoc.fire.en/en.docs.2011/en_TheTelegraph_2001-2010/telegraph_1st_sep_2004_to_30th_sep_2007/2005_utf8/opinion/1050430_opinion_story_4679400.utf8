 SAVE

 THE LAST

 DANCE

 The Shiva Tandava had once brought her glory. But as chairperson of the Sangeet Natak Akademi Sonal Mansingh can hardly use it to her advantage

 Don?t ? the pundits once said ? mix politics with sports. And don?t ? they now add ? mix it with the arts. For the reaction, they warn, can be volatile. Just ask Sonal Mansingh.

 Till the other day, Mansingh was primarily known as a classical dancer. Today, the 62-year-old chairperson of the Sangeet Natak Akademi (SNA) is being described as a political manipulator by her own community of artistes. Members of the academy have resigned in protest against what they describe as her autocratic way of functioning. Letters have been sent to the President and appeals to the information and broadcasting minister asking that she be removed. On the other hand, former SNA chairperson Girish Karnad has urged that she be left alone. And Mansingh herself has met the Prime Minister and the Congress president to present her side of the story. Clearly, there is an ugly storm brewing in the government-run cultural centre.

 The complaints against her are long and plenty: the dissidents in the academy say she is unable to manage funds efficiently, walks all over other artistes and employees of the SNA and relentlessly promotes herself. Her conduct, a group of artistes and activists say in a letter to the President, is ?unconstitutional, undemocratic, unethical, unwarranted and unbecoming?. Mansingh, in turn, has said that her detractors have launched a vilification campaign against her, partly because she is a woman.

 There was a time, of course, when all was well with Mansingh and the cultural world. ?We thought she was secular,? says theatre director M.K. Raina, an activist of the Safdar Hashmi Memorial Trust (Sahmat), pointing out that she even danced for a programme convened by Sahmat.

 Trouble first broke out when Mansingh took part in a show organised by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad. By the time the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government was at the Centre, she was being seen as a government groupie. Mansingh was even among a handful of people who issued a public notice urging voters to elect Atal Bihari Vajpayee. So when she was appointed by the then National Democratic Alliance government as the head of the SNA in December 2003, nobody was really surprised.

 But, clearly, it has not been an uneventful tenure so far. It started with a bang when, the day after she took over, a programme was held to mark 50 years of the SNA with the release of a stamp. There were loud murmurs of protest because Mansingh?s predecessor, the singer-composer, Bhupen Hazarika, had not been invited to the show ? though it had been planned under his tenure. That caused some unpleasantness, forcing Vajpayee to launch into a Hazarika eulogy at the function and former culture minister Jagmohan to voice an apology.

 Things took a turn for the worse earlier this month when several members of the academy ? noted artistes, all ? resigned from the body. Carnatic classical singer M. Balamuralikrishna was the first to resign. SNA insiders say that Mansingh had, without consulting him, proposed his name for the post of the vice-chairperson of the SNA in an apparent bid to stymie the theatre person, K.N. Pannikar, who had been put up by the dissidents. Pannikar won the election handsomely, but resigned last week to support Balamuralikrishna. A spate of resignations followed, and the SNA insiders say that a few others may also step down.

 For the Odissi and Bharatnatyam dancer, it has been a battle from day one. The insiders say that one of the first things she tried to do was move the SNA from the back of a building which also houses the Lalit Kala Akademi and Sahitya Akademi to its forefront. Mansingh was offended that she had to pass a malodorous bathroom on her way to office. The move failed, but Mansingh ? whose Gujarati grandfather was a governor ? is not the one to bow down. These days, there is an attendant who sits outside the bathroom to clean it through the day.

 When Mansingh makes news, it?s the headline-hitting kind. Oldtimers recall how, when the Festival of India was a well-funded national jamboree, she ? along with dancers Yamini Krishnamurthi and Uma Sharma ? accused the festival authorities of doling out patronage to a select few, while sidelining the three doyennes. Mansingh, who came back to centre-stage after a crippling accident in the Seventies, was the most vociferous of them all. 

 The present crisis may go Mansingh?s way, too. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is believed to have indicated to the culture ministry to not unseat Mansingh, whose term comes to an end in December 2008. 

 But, the SNA ? once chaired by luminaries such as Kamladevi Chattopadhyaya ? remains shaken to its core. The anti-Mansingh camp at the academy is gearing up for another round of battle. And, all the while, Mansingh does an item that once brought her glory ? the Shiva Tandava.

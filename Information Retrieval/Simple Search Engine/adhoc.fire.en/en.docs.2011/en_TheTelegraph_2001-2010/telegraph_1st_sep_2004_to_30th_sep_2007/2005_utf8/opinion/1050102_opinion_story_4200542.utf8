 DIARY

 Atal Bihari Vajpayee seems to have decided to claim his place in the limelight. With LK Advani taking off for the Tsunami-hit areas, the ex-PM decided to call over a few journalists to his residence to announce the formation of an eight-member relief committee and a fund for the victims. Earlier, he took centre-stage in Parliament and gave direction to the opposition?s disaffection with the government, when he attacked it for pressurizing the CBI in the Babri Masjid demolition case. Then on his birthday, Dec 25, he declared grandiloquently to journalists in Gwalior, ?I am here to stay.? The veteran politician seems to have regained a sense of his charisma and power for the first time since the BJP?s May debacle. Perhaps all the recent criticism of Advani?s handling of Uma Bharti, Smriti Irani, et al have made Vajpayee realize that he need fear the BJP president no longer. Or is it simply a case of when the cat is away, the mouse will play?

 Few people talk any longer about Sonia Gandhi?s ?foreign origins?. But even those who do would surely be converted if they knew that she found Kishori Amonkar and Pandit Jasraj very soothing in times of stress. As with most things Indian, it was Rajiv Gandhi who had apparently introduced Sonia to the wonders of Indian classical music way back in 1968 and ever since, it has been her weakness. Really, how much more Indian can you get?

 While on Sonia, mediamen seem to be having a rollicking time with her party back in power. Not that the BJP treated them badly. But you didn?t get prawn cocktail-hot casserole-chocolate truffle cake briefings. The idea of hosting a year-end lunch for women journalists in the capital, where a sumptuous spread vied for attention with trade figures, the nuances of the WTO and Doon School gossip was the brainchild of the Union commerce minister, Kamal Nath. And its success is evident from the reputation Nath has acquired of being a ?hands-on? minister. 

 In contrast, tea and biscuits are all that the reporters get in the room of RPN Singh, AICC secretary in charge of Jharkhand. But he is no less popular. For you may be turned away empty-handed by the gen-sec Janardhan Dwivedi, but RPN will always have some juicy piece of information, just for you. That?s what they call media savvy. 

 To be sure, you either have media savvy or you don?t. And Digvijay Singh definitely does not. The two-time CM of Madhya Pradesh could be heard lamenting in Bhopal?s coffee house the other day that he had tamed many a tiger in the state (Arjun Singh?, The Shukla brothers?). ?Lekin main Delhi mein shehri chuhon ko kabu nahin kar pa raha hoon.? Perhaps, Nath or RPN should teach him a thing or two.

 Tinker and tamper. The BJP does not seem to have learnt a lesson from its election defeats. In the assembly elections to be held in Haryana in February, the saffron party has decided to go it alone ? defying all the pleas of a section of the state party unit and some Central leaders like Madanlal Khurana. It was these very men who had protested against the BJP?s snapping ties with Om Prakash Chautala?s INLD after the alliance suffered heavy losses in last summer?s general elections. What the BJP doesn?t realize is that with this decision, it might just be facilitating the return to power of the Congress. And the wind seems to be turning the Congress?s way with Bansi Lal, the state unit chief, being the preferred candidate for CM. As a rustic Haryanvi put it ? ?Ghooshkhor bina aatank key achcha hain? (referring to the terror of the extended Chautala clan). At least, the voters have their priorities right.

 Why is it that we Indians still wait for foreigners to endorse something to realize its worth? Is it our colonial hangover or a collective inferiority complex? It took an article in the American weekly, Time, which called the Lodi Gardens one of the worthiest assets in all of south Asia, for those entrusted with maintaining this patch of green in the heart of New Delhi to wake up to their task. Visitors to the gardens will now find it spruce, its hedges trimmed, its walkways free of potholes and the turf free of litter. Will the Time next turn its attention to the Taj Mahal please?

 People-to-people contact is turning out to be a useful pretext for anyone-who-is-anyone in India to cross the Wagah into Pakistan, and vice versa. Journalists, women?s groups, filmstars, singers, schoolchildren ? everyone seems to be crossing borders. So how can the politicians lag behind? Laloo Prasad Yadav has been there, as has his b?te noire, Ram Vilas Paswan. Now Manmohan Singh is said to be weighing the pros and cons of calling on our neighbour to the north. Sonia Gandhi has an open invitation from Pervez Musharraf, who has asked her to take the initiative to normalize Indo-Pak ties. But even as the two dither, it may well be Arjun Singh who lands up there first. The Union HRD minister has an invitation to attend a meeting on women and child welfare. And given Singh?s propensity to consider himself as first among equals, don?t be surprised to hear of a diplomatic initiative by him, even before the PM has had a chance to get in a word.

 ASSEMBLY TIME

 What is common to government offices, cabinet meetings and schools in Madhya Pradesh? They have all been reduced to a levelling juvenility by Mr Babulal Gaur. His government had ruled that from July 1, all government employees, ministers and students would have to congregate and sing Vande Mataram on the first day of every month. This would inspire them to not only patriotic feelings but also punctuality, honesty and so on. Government employees would also have to be in some sort of uniform ? back to school again ? together with badges displaying their names and posts. There is a background to all this, which goes back to Mr Gaur?s predecessor, Ms Uma Bharti. Ms Bharti, after enshrining the cow in her state?s economy, had set about declaring all its pilgrimage spots ?holy?. This meant a ban on the sale of eggs, meat, fish, alcohol, sex and condoms in these towns. The sex-workers were piqued, but the sadhus and mahants were delighted. Mr Gaur then outdid her by declaring a few more towns holy, and outlawing ?multi-national drinks? (Pepsi and Coke) as well, in order to promote butter milk, lassi and shrikhand in their place.

 The state legal department has now pointed out to Mr Gaur that it would be quite unconstitutional to force people to sing religious or patriotic songs and then punish them if they refused to do so. There are Supreme Court and high court rulings as well, which make such arbitrary impositions illegal. Minority organizations, civil rights groups, opposition members and women who cannot bear to wear cheap printed sarees supplied by the government have also added their voices of protest. This, as some would remember, is vintage Hindutva. Even the Bharatiya Janata Party, in its current avatar, would consider this sort of thing retrograde. When, in 1999, a ?basic education? minister in Uttar Pradesh made similar noises about the same song, Mr L.K. Advani vetoed him, against the wishes of some of his party colleagues in the state. This minister was later removed, but UP?s latest basic education minister has now vetoed sex education in the state?s schools, declaring condoms ? which Ms Bharti and the sadhus had once declared ?evil? ? bad for children. With purity-enthusiasts like Ms Bharti, Mr Gaur and these basic education ministers, the BJP would need to work somewhat harder to modernize its public image.

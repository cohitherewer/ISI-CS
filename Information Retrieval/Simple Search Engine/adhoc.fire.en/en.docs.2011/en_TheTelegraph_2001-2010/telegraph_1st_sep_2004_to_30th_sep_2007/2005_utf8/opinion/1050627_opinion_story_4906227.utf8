 Letters to Editor

 What?s in a dress?

 Sir ? As a woman, born and brought up in India, I harbour no illusions about the strictures passed by the moral police in the name of making our society safer for women. I am referring to the proposal mooted by Vijay Khole, the vice-chancellor of Mumbai University, to impose a stringent dress code for women in the city?s colleges (?Dress diktat awaits girls? June 23). If a dress code for college girls could prevent heinous crimes like rape, then five-year-old girls should be made to wear saris too, because a large number of rape victims are minors. By blaming the rising incidents of rape on women dressing provocatively, men like Khole are only trying to shield the real culprits. Don?t they know that even burqa-clad women are not safe in Islamic countries today? 

 Yours faithfully,

Sudeshna Roy Choudhury, Calcutta

 Sir ? The vice-chancellor?s call for a dress code for college-girls in Mumbai is absolutely justified. Skimpy clothes worn by young girls only increase their chances of being abused by depraved men. Women in our country need to dress modestly to ensure their own safety. Universities, not just in Mumbai but all over India, should formulate a dress-code for girl students as an effective measure against crimes like rape. 

 Moreover, there is no reason to believe that a dress code impairs a woman?s freedom. After all, freedom does not mean that a woman has the right to dress and act in any manner she likes.

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba

 Sir ? The vice-principal of Kirori Mal college, New Delhi, recently prescribed a dress code for girl-students from the North-east only. But why should women from a particular region be forced to change their style of dressing when the real fault lies with the men who molest them? Moreover, it is not true that north-eastern women are the sole victims of rape. Recently an 80-year-old woman was assaulted in Delhi while a German tourist was raped in Jodhpur. The gang rapes of a student from Sikkim, and that of a Mizo student a month earlier, fit into this general pattern of violence against women. Isn?t it important that the authorities put a stop to crimes against all women irrespective of the place they hail from?

 Yours faithfully,

Omar Luther King, Shillong

 Sir ? Girl students in Mumbai may see red with the vice-chancellor?s suggestion for a dress code in colleges in the city. But the proposal must have surely cheered the Shiv Sena chief, Bal Thackeray, who seems to share the vice chancellor?s parochial sentiments. Khole should now seriously consider joining Thackeray?s party. That would help him force his views down the throat of those who are not ready to accept them.

 Yours faithfully,

Shonali Basu, Calcutta

 Sir ? Deliberations on a dress code for women are usually launched by conservative outfits like the sangh parivar to gain political mileage. This time though, the vice chancellor of Mumbai University sought to impose a dress code to ensure the safety of girl students in the city, and not because of any other reason. One cannot dismiss the vice-chancellor?s views as old-fashioned as the proposal, if implemented, would go a long way in preserving the dignity of girl students in the city.

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? The proposal to impose a dress code on girls in Mumbai?s colleges is laudable. Men are often blamed for misbehaving with women. While that may be the case in some instances, it is equally true that women often invite trouble by dressing skimpily. Those who disapprove of a dress code should realize that women are better off avoiding clothes that are fit to be worn on screen only.

 Yours faithfully,

Payel Bhattacharyya, Calcutta

 Sir ? Enforcing a dress code for girl students does not mean that cases of sexual harassment would be few and far between. The fact that it is the men who need to restrain their libidinous urges seems to have eluded the conscientious vice chancellor. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir? Why do drivers impatiently blow their horns while waiting for the traffic signal lights to change below the Park Circus flyover? Surely the lights will not change at their convenience? All civilized cities of the world have laws against honking. Calcutta should have one too. Calcuttans already live with hundred and one kinds of pollution. Must we add one more to the list by honking unnecessarily?

 Yours faithfully,

Maureen Lobo, Calcutta

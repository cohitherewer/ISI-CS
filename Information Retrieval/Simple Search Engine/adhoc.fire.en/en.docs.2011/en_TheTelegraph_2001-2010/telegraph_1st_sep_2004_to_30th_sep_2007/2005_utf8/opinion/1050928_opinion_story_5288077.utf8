 Letters to Editor

 Without care

 Sir ? I cannot agree more with the editorial, ?Doctor on call? (Sept 22), on the unexplained urge of the government to start a short-term course to produce more physicians for rural India. Not surprisingly, the leaders of the Indian Medical Association have objected to the course. The practice of medicine today is a profitable business and our modern day healers are reluctant to share the profit with more doctors. 

 India has one of the lowest doctor-patient ratios in the world and there can be no argument that more doctors are needed to tackle the healthcare crisis, especially in the villages across India. But the declining number of doctors is hardly the primary reason for the dismal healthcare system. Rampant corruption and lack of accountability are the two principal reasons behind it. Moreover, is there any guarantee that the entrants to the ?short? medical course will diligently provide their service to the rural population? How do we know that they will not emulate their urban counterparts who, despite being under official obligation to serve in the villages, are always missing in action? 

 The level of efficiency is also another cause for worry. How can the government be so sure that doctors produced by the three year courses will be able to provide proper care to villagers? Besides, who will standardize the medical education for this abbreviated medical course? Traditionally, the medical council has the duty to establish the adequate standard of medical education. Unfortunately, the performance of the Medical Council of India, the central medicine regulatory agency, has been abysmal. The Supreme Court of India has recently come down heavily on the MCI for corruption. Until the government takes stringent measures against corrupt doctors at the helm of medical education, starting a new short course will add to the misery of patients.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ?Whenever there is a new occupant of the chair of the health minister, he tries to do something new, if only for the heck of it. Several schemes are introduced, but the lack of coordination among various agencies make sure that they do not succeed. Health administrators are now looking towards the integration of all health-related projects and their management by primary health centres. But instead of looking at ways to see how the health centres could function more efficiently, the government has come up with the proposal to run a parallel course for rural doctors. 

 When the national rural health mission was launched by the prime minister, we expected it to try and strengthen the primary health centres by filling the large number of vacancies of doctors, by opening blood banks, appointing anaesthetists and multipurpose health-workers, opening pathology and radiology units to perform the basic investigations, providing regular supply of essential medicines and so on. Instead, a lot of energy and money will now be wasted on opening new medical colleges and revamping medical education. 

 The authorities do not realize that there is no dearth of medical professionals in the country. The problem lies in their proper utilization and distribution. We do not have a proper policy of appointment and transfer of doctors. The procedure adopted by the public service commission is so cumbersome that the government often has to appoint doctors on a contractual basis, bypassing the commission. There should be a medical service commission to appoint doctors on a regular basis. If the internship period is increased to two years, including a year of compulsory rural service before permanent registration is given, the government will get a huge number of doctors to man the rural health centres. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The three-year course in medicine is a wonderful idea, and will produce half-baked doctors for more than half of India?s population. In fact, there has never been a better rural scheme for the urban population. Parents in the city can now breathe easy. If their children fail to qualify for the severely-competitive and humongously long course in the city colleges, they can go to the villages for the much-needed breather and a degree.

 Yours faithfully,

J. Acharya, Calcutta

 Sir ? Why does the government think that while urbanites can be served only by doctors who have studied for five or more years, rural folks can make do with barefoot doctors or those who have studied for three years? Are their lives any less valuable than those who live in the cities?

 Yours faithfully,

M. Chatterjee, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir ? The taxi driver who dropped me at the Vancouver Airport on my way to Los Angeles was an Iranian, Ali Khabbazi, who once lived in Calcutta and played forward line in the East Bengal Club between 1981-87. The 45 minutes he took to reach the airport was spent in recounting his memories. Khabbazzi studied at the Aligarh Muslim University and spent the football season in Calcutta. He has very fond memories of the city ? of the day he fell asleep in the zoo and was woken up by the mali, who reminded him of his match and helped him find a taxi to get to the ground. Khabbazzi still remembers the crowd, the people, the Hindi films, singhara, chai... He now lives in Vancouver and drives a private taxi of his own and is happy. Any desire to return to Calcutta ? ?I cannot afford it?, Khabbazzi said, ?but wish my Club brought me to Calcutta, my city, for a few days of nostalgia.? For me, a die hard Calcuttan, it was an emotional trip into the Eighties.

 Yours faithfully,

Paresh Rajda, Calcutta

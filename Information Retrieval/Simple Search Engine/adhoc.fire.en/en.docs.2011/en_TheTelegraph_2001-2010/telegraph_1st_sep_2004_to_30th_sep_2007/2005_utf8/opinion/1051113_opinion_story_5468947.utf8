 DIARY

 When the world is against you, support often springs from the unlikeliest of quarters. Natwar Singh, blinded by rage that he is, is not in a mood to spot friends. And in any case, he didn?t have too many of them in his own party. He has been spewing venom at any Congress leader he suspects had a role in his removal from the MEA ? Ambika Soni, Kapil Sibal and a host of other prominent Congressmen and women came in for some colourful invectives. But the best was reserved for Pranab Mukherjee, who, Natwar is convinced, advised Sonia Gandhi against retaining him as the foreign minister. Natwar simply dismissed him as the ?paune char foot oonchai wala Bengali dada?. But not everyone is waiting to have a go at the newest minister without a portfolio. There is at least one who could have done a lot of damage, but chose not to. The story goes like this. A west Asian daily first revealed the Indian connection in the oil-for-food scam in early 2004. The news duly reached the South Block, manned in those days by Brajesh Mishra. Both Mishra and the Big Boss, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, chose not to disclose the news and embarrass Natwar and the Congress. Why? Perhaps because Mishra is the friend that Natwar has been looking for in a crowd of enemies. 

 Natwar?s ire may have fallen on Madam and her coterie of advisers, but the prime minister himself is known to have been quite involved in the decision-making process. He took it upon himself to check the facts in the Volcker report that cast a shadow on his foreign minister. The buzz is that Manmohan Singh personally contacted Paul Volcker for a cross-checking session. Of course, it helped that being the governor of the Reserve Bank at the same time that Volcker was the governor of the Federal Reserve, their association goes quite some way back.

 The lady at 10 Janpath has her plate full, even without the Volcker report. With the elderly brigade failing to live up to her expectations, Sonia naturally turned to the young Turks. But to her disappointment, she found that the Congress babalog were taking things too lightly. The junior Pilots and Scindias and... ahem, Gandhis have not exactly managed to put up a stellar performance in parliament. And so, one of the first assignments of the new parliamentary affairs minister, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, is to devise ways of involving these younger MPs in parliamentary activities. Madam wants them to be groomed well as parliamentarians before giving them bigger responsibilities. Come November 13, when the winter session of Parliament begins, Indian TV viewers will get more of the young Congressmen solemnly debating over national issues in parliament. Will this increase the TRP ratings of the Lok Sabha telecast? 

 What?s up with Uma Bharti? Given that reticence has never been one of her virtues, observers have interpreted her two-week long silence as the lull before the storm. And who is the storm going to blow away? LK Advani, say those in the know. Bharti has divulged to her friends in the media that it was Advani who had instigated her to write a letter against RSS?s Suresh Soni, and it was Advani himself who leaked it to the press, thereby turning the RSS against her. Her theatrics are expected to begin soon, and may also include suicide threats. In the meantime, she is keeping herself in good spirits by inviting top editors and journos for ?off the record? chats.

 The late KR Narayanan was a repository of anecdotes. One of his favourite stories was about a fellow-diplomat-turned-politician and his reproachable conduct during the funeral of Indira Gandhi. Narayanan would recall with horror how this worthy had organized diamond-shopping for Imelda Marcos in Chandni Chowk while the state was in mourning and Delhi under curfew following the violence against Sikhs. The punchline: Narayanan got even with him during his stint at the Rashtrapati Bhavan.

 A cabinet reshuffle is due anytime now. No prizes for guessing the most coveted portfolio ? external affairs, of course. The favourite in the race ? Pranab Mukherjee. But Salman Khurshid and Ambika Soni are lobbying hard to be minister of state.

 Minutes after Gautam Gambhir set the Motera stadium in Ahmedabad ablaze with a scintillating 103, Arun Jaitley received a call in New Delhi. The caller was Gambhir?s grandfather, the new Indian opener?s mentor and prime source of inspiration. Grandpa Gambhir, a property dealer in Delhi, was already known to Jaitley, whose love of cricket is not unknown. The story goes that Gambhir senior had, for a long time, been after Jaitley, one of Indian cricket?s kingmakers and head of Delhi?s cricket establishment, for arranging Gambhir?s entry into Team India. Jaitley?s standard reply was that so long as a short man from Mumbai was playing, there was no chance. If Gambhir were to be given a chance, could he play like Tendulkar? Jaitley asked. The grandfather waited till he could give a suitable reply. The Ahmedabad ton by the grandson finally provided the opportunity. Jaitley agreed that he had enjoyed the Delhi boy?s batting every bit as much as he enjoys the little master?s.

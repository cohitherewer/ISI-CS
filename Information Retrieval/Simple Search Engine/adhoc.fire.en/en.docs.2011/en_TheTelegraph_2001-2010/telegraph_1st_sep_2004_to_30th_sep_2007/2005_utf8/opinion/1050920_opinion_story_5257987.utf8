 VOTE THEM OUT

 The question of accountability is seldom confronted when one of the alleged offenders is the state. Mr A. Narasing Lal of Pillayalapalli village in Andhra Pradesh has asked the state government for damages because he feels that it has ruined his life by providing him education of unacceptably poor quality. Mr Lal, in his mid-thirties, has sent a detailed complaint to the state human rights commission, listing the various ways in which his zilla-parishad school has failed to equip him for a proper professional life, and has demanded action against this school and its teachers. His action raises three important issues. First, such an active notion of accountability on the part of Mr Lal is unusual and is to be lauded. India is full of citizens who are quietly resigned ? rendered powerless, and hence voiceless, by poverty or other forms of marginality ? to take what they are ?given? as their lot. Abysmal healthcare, substandard education and a dysfunctional public distribution system are three such instances of bad luck that immediately come to mind. To confront the government, through the human rights commission, so directly is a radical departure from such resignation.

 Yet, taking the matter to court is not the only, or the best, way of doing this. It is usually not the job of the courts to redress a citizen?s grievances against the state, however legitimate these might be. Litigation of this nature will only end up wasting judicial time. From air pollution to the neglect of national heritage, the best way to deal with the failings of the government is to vote the government out by making use of one?s electoral powers. Active and critical citizenry within an electoral democracy should allow the courts to get on with what they are meant to do. Finally, Mr Lal?s criticism of the education system should become the basis of an open debate on the quality of education in rural schools, and how the government, as service provider, might be held accountable to its failings. The specific elements in Mr Lal?s indictment of his school ? the culture of cheating, the neglect of standards ? are all valuable points of entry into a system that might leave a man feeling ?drowned in the journey of life?, as Mr Lal?s puts it. This sharp sense of injustice, rather than leading to judicial activism, should motivate more citizens to make proper use of their democratic rights.

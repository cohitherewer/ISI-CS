 TINKER TAILOR

 There is a refusal to accept on Mr P. Chidambaram?s part that there are issues on which half measures just do not work. His tinkering with fringe benefit tax is a typical example of a move that satisfied nobody. He believes that FBT will bring to the exchequer a substantial chunk of revenue. Proceeding on this, he has, to accommodate the protests that followed his original proposal in the Union budget, tried to reduce the impact of the imposition. He has excluded advertisements from the purview of the tax. But taxes on telephone bills and other items have been enhanced. Thus, what the finance minister has given with his left hand, he has taken away with his right. In other words, Mr Chidambaram refused to admit that the entire scheme was faulty and illogical. This was precisely the point that the critics of FBT had made after the budget speech. Nobody made a case to lower the burden of the tax; everybody questioned the logic on which FBT was promulgated. It was argued that FBT aimed at genuine business costs in the name of taxing fringe benefits and under the pretext of catching out companies that were avoiding tax by a wide interpretation of the rules governing perquisites. Mr Chidambaram had promised to look into the basis of FBT but he has only nibbled at it.

 The finance minister tried to explain his failure to keep his promise by asserting that the effective rate on companies was lower than the nominal rate. And that the FBT would only raise the effective rate by a mere 1 to 1.5 percentage points. This is a very clever way of deflecting criticism and more becoming of Mr Chidambaram, the lawyer, than Mr Chidambaram, the finance minister. The burden of the tax has never been the bone of contention. The objection is much more fundamental: the logic behind the tax. This is a deplorable sleight of hand. It is obvious that the finance minister has his eyes on greater revenue. But it is not yet clear how much more revenue FBT will bring to the fisc. The other point that the finance minister has deliberately chosen to ignore is the opportunity FBT creates, by its very nature, for harassment by tax officials and the latter?s illegal gratification. To put salt on wounds, the finance minister has decided to tax superannuation benefits. In a country like India, without a social security system, this can only be described as the most unkindest cut of all.

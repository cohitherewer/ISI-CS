 ADORABLE SLEUTH NEXT DOOR

 TRACE By Patricia Cornwell, Little, Brown, ? 6.99

 ?Yellow bulldozers and excavators hack earth and stone in an old city that has seen more death than most modern wars? ? this is Kay Scarpetta?s horrified reaction to the sight of her old office at Richmond being dismantled to make way for a parking deck for the restored Mainstreet Railway Station. She is back again at Richmond, Virginia five years after being ?fired? from her job of a chief medical examiner. 

 Ignoring her wounded sentiments and initial hesitation, she has accepted the call of her successor, Dr Joel Marcus, to provide forensic lead to the mysterious death of a teenage girl, Gilly Paulsson. Gilly is supposed to have died of flu.

 But the forensic examination comes up with confounding results, throwing the fait accompli to the wind. Meanwhile, Scarpetta?s niece, Lucy Farinelli, who has set up a flourishing investigation firm in Florida, has her own share of troubles. Henri Walder, one of her recruits, gets assaulted in Lucy?s residence by an intruder. Henri?s posture and her bruises when she is found uncon- scious bear striking resemblance to Gilly?s when she was found dead. 

 This leads to the inference that Gilly was actually murdered and that her assailants and Henri?s are the same person. He has left traces deliberately ? a red rose or the picture of an eye, full with lashes, for instance ? which serve only to complicate the maze for Scarpetta. Scarpetta?s Aspen-dwelling lover, Benton Wesley, too gets implicated in the mess.

 Patricia Cornwell?s Trace is packed with all the brain-teasing ingredients of the other Scarpetta novels. Scarpetta is not the Miss Marple kind of high-IQ domestic women who solve mysteries from the from of their drawing-rooms. She is the empowered woman who cracks cases in dare-devilish ways, loves risks and pitches right into where danger lurks. 

 There is a softer side to her as well, evident when she does not think of concealing her feelings of hurt, or gives in to bouts of nostalgia or feels pained because of what ?ignorant? people say about the profession of forensic pathologists. She is hardened, but not to the extent that she does not feel outraged by a chilling evidence of child abuse. There are sleuths whom we admire more than we love them. Cornwell?s tough-and-tender investigator will be loved more than she is admired. The prose is crisp, and Scarpetta?s romanticism is not lost upon the readers.

 TEA AMP; SYMPATHY

 The big picture is often the casualty in small bargains. The tripartite agreement that ended the 15-day-old strike in West Bengal?s tea gardens is an example. The workers would henceforth receive higher wages, thanks to the intervention of the chief minister, who was obviously anxious to see the gardens reopen and the state?s industrial image improve. But there was nothing in the negotiations to suggest that Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was half as anxious to look into the real problems facing the tea industry. Low productivity, unsustainable costs and, above all, stiff market competition have doomed Bengal?s tea industry to chronic sickness. But the trade unions affiliated to Mr Bhattacharjee?s own Communist Party of India (Marxist) seem to be intent as ever on squeezing the industry dry in order to get all kinds of benefits for the workers. This clearly is aimed at serving small partisan interests at the cost of the industry. This is bad politics and worse economics. The state power that is used to force the tea planters into periodic wage agreements does little to save the industry from a slow death. 

 Yet, the government can actually do much to help the tea industry try and stem the rot. Tea planters have traditionally been saddled with responsibilities that should have been borne by the government. The so-called social costs of tea gardens ? for education, health and subsidized ration for the workers and sundry other items ? add to their economic burden. They are a legacy of the times when the garden management filled in for a non-existent state infrastructure. And when the local government took roots in the form of panchayati raj institutions, the tea gardens were kept out of their purview. The idea was to force the gardens to shoulder many of the responsibilities that should have passed on to the panchayats. If there was no logic behind this, populist politics ensured that the old ways did not change. The time has passed for the gardens to provide for these facilities and still be a viable enterprise. Recent reports of starvation deaths from some tea gardens in Jalpaiguri suggest that the government has failed to keep its commitments to the poor in these areas. It will not do to put the blame for the government?s failures on the tea producers. It is his role in the industry?s revival that should be of greater concern to the chief minister.

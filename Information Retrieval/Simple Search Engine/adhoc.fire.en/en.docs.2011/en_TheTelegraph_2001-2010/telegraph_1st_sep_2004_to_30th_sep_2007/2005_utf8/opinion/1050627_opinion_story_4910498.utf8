 AIZAWL NOTEBOOK 

 ?Outsider? Indivar Kamtekar takes a peek into the 

 world of the reluctant Indians 

 The author teaches history at Jawaharlal Nehru University, 

 New Delhi

 The taste first 

 Outsider/Indian 

 The signboard at the airport is 

 unsettling. ?Foreigners and Outsiders? are supposed to report 

 at a particular desk in the arrival lounge. Though it turns 

 out that I don?t need an Inner-Line Permit, as I?m an Indian 

 coming to Mizoram on official work, the ?outsider? designation 

 remains, like a badge pinned on my shirt, through the following 

 week.

 We?ve landed at Aizawl?s Lengpui 

 airport in a fifty-seater propeller plane, after flying 

 over sparsely populated and stunningly green hills. I?m 

 looking forward to seeing this part of my country, I tell 

 myself. Ahead lies an antidote to the crowds of Calcutta, 

 and the relentless monotony of the parched north Indian 

 plain. The taxi ride from the airport to the Tourist Lodge 

 in Chaltlang takes us an hour-and-half, past hill-station 

 scenery and some houses on stilts.

 Kendriya Vidyalaya maxims 

 At about 4 am the next morning, 

 a cock crows. By 4.30 there is sunlight and the crowing 

 has achieved the momentum of an express train. The creature 

 is not going to shut up, so I get out of bed, planning revenge. 

 Chicken curry for dinner!

 I?m in Aizawl with two colleagues 

 to oversee my university?s entrance exam, which is being 

 held here for the first time. Our examination centre is 

 the local Kendriya Vidyalaya, a set of aluminium-roofed 

 sheds on a hilltop, decorated with wise sayings and garish 

 portraits of national heroes. It has the peace and quiet 

 of a school in holiday time. There?s a panoramic view of 

 the town. Aizawl is about the size of Shimla, with houses 

 crouching above one another, as if about to tumble down 

 the hillside.

 I collect slogans. My favourite 

 was the one at Shimla railway station: ?Let us all, Hindus, 

 Muslims, Sikhs and Christians, Unite for the Sake of Our 

 Motherhood.? The road to Aizawl provided ?Slow Drive Long 

 Life? and ?Short Cut May Cut Short Life.? Our KV offers 

 a different flavour: ?Experience is a hard teacher. It gives 

 the test first and the lesson afterwards.? Or you can relish: 

 ?Danish proverb: He who is ashamed to ask is afraid of learning.? 

 That?s a good one, if the kids can ask without peril.

 We meet the principal and scrutinize 

 our list of examinees. Tomorrow?s session will have, among 

 others, fifteen candidates for an MA in English, and only 

 one for a Master?s in computer science. The pull of IT and 

 Infosys lies truly far away.

 Two of our exam sessions are on 

 a Sunday. A parent tells me this is inappropriate. I explain, 

 ineffectually, how difficult it is to schedule seventy-eight 

 question papers in sixty-three exam centres. Driving through 

 Aizawl?s main market afterwards, I understand the rebuke. 

 Every shop, without exception, is shut, and there is hardly 

 a taxi to be had. Everyone goes to church here. The Christian 

 societies I?ve seen in Europe and America ? or on TV ? have 

 been secularized. This is different.

 An electric pole 

 As a determined sightseer, I easily 

 recognize members of that breed. There don?t seem to be 

 any around in Aizawl. The Tourist Lodge is infested with 

 pontificating academics and NGO-types, rather than the wide-eyed, 

 camera-toting creature it?s meant to house.

 No postcards are on sale anywhere 

 in Aizawl (later the Tourist Lodge disgorges four, depicting 

 other parts of Mizoram, meant for free distribution). Instead 

 of the bamboo hat or khumbeu at the state emporium 

 as local produce I buy myself a notebook with a ?Mizo Boy? 

 printed on the cover. On closer inspection, ?Mizo Boy? turns 

 out to be made in Calcutta.

 The Mizoram State Museum on MacDonald 

 Hill is celebrating International Museums? Day. The five-rupee 

 entry fee has been waived. Each visitor gets two toffees, 

 providing some consolation to swarming schoolchildren. There?s 

 an interesting model of the zawlbuk or bachelors? 

 dormitory, and a forlorn set of musical instruments. The 

 most striking exhibit is a bullet-riddled electric pole, 

 with a notice proclaiming that it was located, during the 

 insurgency, in the heart of Aizawl. I know that in 1966, 

 Aizawl passed out of the hands of the government of India 

 for a while, and was even strafed by the Indian air force 

 as a result. Nevertheless, I?m surprised to find such memories 

 enshrined in the state museum, along with the bamboo baskets.

 The idea of India

 Some free time takes me to the 

 Bara Bazar. I find a road called Zion Street, and walk down 

 to Israel Point. Women outnumber men on the streets. Every 

 shop I see is being managed by a woman. Burmese cigarette 

 packets and Indonesian soaps sell at ten rupees each. There 

 seem to be hardly any people from elsewhere in India. It 

 hits me that I haven?t seen a single woman wearing a sari 

 over the last few days; and I haven?t seen a Sikh either. 

 Can the idea of India really exist without sardars 

 and saris?

 The Mizoram state archives are 

 impeccably catalogued and courteously managed. I consult 

 files on the movement to join Burma in 1947. The Indian 

 national flag couldn?t be hoisted in Aizawl on August 15, 

 although the Union Jack was lowered. Lalmawia, an ex-captain 

 of the Indian army, led the pro-Burma movement. An eighty-eight-year-old 

 man I interview later judges that it made some sense then, 

 ?as there were people who felt we are adjacent to Burma, 

 and tribally more similar.? But nobody would think of joining 

 Burma now!

 For dinner at David?s Kitchen, 

 a top local restaurant, I meet a much younger person, the 

 editor of a development journal. ?We are reluctant Indians?, 

 he says to me over rogan josh. Challengingly, he 

 adds: ?How do you react to that?? I babble about historians 

 who hold that nation-states have to be constructed. He ignores 

 what I say. ?I am a Mizo first?, he insists.

 Boozers beware

 When darkness descends by 6 pm 

 in a city which shuts down soon thereafter, evenings in 

 a Tourist Lodge cry out for alcohol. The electricity comes 

 and goes every few minutes; ?alternating current? acquires 

 a new meaning. There?s prohibition of course, but mature 

 adults may be willing to pay extra. Our waiter recoils when 

 this is put to him. Friendly advice follows: be careful, 

 this is dangerous; the YMA, or Young Mizo Association, forbids 

 it. Prohibition here is not just a sarkari matter. 

 The next day, we see a burnt house; it seems the owner sold 

 alcohol. Astoundingly, the main item on the front page of 

 the local English language daily, Newslink, is about 

 a thirty-five-year-old man killed the previous day ? for 

 drinking alcohol.

 The weather over the past week 

 has alternated between sharp sunlight and torrential rain. 

 On our way to the airport the sun shines; when it?s time 

 to board, clouds sweep in. We wait three hours for a clearing, 

 and then fifty passengers run across the tarmac and scramble 

 aboard the turboprop. As we ascend, the ground below looks 

 like a crumpled green handkerchief. Our Alliance Air flight 

 takes an hour-and-half to Calcutta. There ought to be a 

 placard awaiting us when we land, announcing: Now Drink 

 Beer Without Fear.

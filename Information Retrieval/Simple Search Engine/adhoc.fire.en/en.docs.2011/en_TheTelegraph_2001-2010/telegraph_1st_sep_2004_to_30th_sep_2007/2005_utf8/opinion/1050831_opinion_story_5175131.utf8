 THE GIANT PUSH BACKWARD

 The pro-peasant stance of the RSP and Forward Bloc can be seen as an effort to placate their cadre and spoil the show of the Left Front?s largest constituent, writes Sumanta Sen

 Sweet dreams are made of these

 The smaller constituents of the Left Front are up in arms against the Communist Party of India (Marxist). The issue is the transfer of agricultural land for purposes of industrialization, as would be required when the Salim group gets down to work on its huge projects in North 24-Parganas. The Revolutionary Socialist Party and the Forward Bloc see this as a sell-out to private capital and a sacrifice of peasants? interests. ?We shall resist this at all costs?, they have thundered, as has the Trinamool Congress leader, Mamata Banerjee.

 First the smaller constituents. The timing of their outburst is interesting. Negotiations with the Indonesian group have been going on for quite some time. It has been given land for other projects in Howrah, but the Forward Bloc and the RSP have remained silent on that. They remained silent when talks began about the North 24-Parganas projects, even though everything was being done openly. Then came the objections raised by the land reforms minister, Abdur Rezzak Molla, and the two parties sat up as realization dawned on them that here was yet another stick to beat the Marxists with. Noises began to be made and the war cry was sounded when the chief minister was abroad. The purpose was clear: embarrass Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and his party.

 It is obvious, therefore, that the smaller parties did not bother to know what was going on in the ministry, or, to take an uncharitable view, they failed to grasp the implications of a decision at the outset. In the present case, of course, it is doubtful whether they would have reacted at all if the cue had not come from a Marxist minister. All this time they had the relevant papers before them but, obviously had not bothered to go through those. This is not surprising considering the way the departments of public-works and irrigation, held by the two parties, are run.

 The two parties are angry but they know which side of the bread is buttered. As in the past, this time also they have made it clear that there was no question of quitting the ministry in protest. Yet that would have lent greater weight to their protest, it would have given them a measure of respectability. But then there is always the future to be considered.

 So where do these parties go from here, as there is no way in which the chief minister can, or is going to, backtrack? One way out is to seek one-to-one talks with Bhattacharjee and announce to the world that they are satisfied with the assurance that farmers? interest will not be neglected. That assurance has been given, more than once, but perhaps they would like to see it come in a formal meeting. The reality will remain the same but at least the two parties will be able to tell their cadre that they are not sitting idle in Calcutta.

 To a large extent, all such outbursts are aimed at the cadre. In Cooch Behar or Gosaba or elsewhere, these people are always mortified at the Left Front government being commonly perceived as the ?CPI(M) government?. While the largest party draws flak for all lapses, it also picks up the kudos. The world at large does not seem to recognize that there are other parties in the front also. So the cadre get restless and begin to wonder what their leaders are up to. Their restlessness also springs from the fact that the RSP and Forward Bloc have always been rabidly anti-communist. Although circumstances may have forced them to live with the CPI(M), they have never been happy about this. It is to pacify their cadre that the leaders have had to make periodic anti-Marxist noises. They know that in the last 28 years they have become largely irrelevant in the state?s politics, but what can they do? The Forward Bloc had remained silent even when the late Promode Das Gupta had reacted to its demand for front committees at the grassroots level with the jibe: ?Grass is there and so also the roots, but where is the Forward Bloc??

 But what is it that the two parties, or even conservatives within the CPI(M), want? They all say that they want development, but not at the cost of land reforms. So will development come just by allowing peasants to cling on to small and largely uneconomic holdings? May one humbly point out that land reforms do not lead to socialism but are aimed at breaking the shackles of feudalism? If such reforms are not accompanied by industrial growth then economic conditions will force the same beneficiaries to sell off their plots and it will then be back to square one, just as is happening in West Bengal. And industries cannot come up unless some agricultural land is sacrificed without hampering agricultural operations in any big way. This is simple and there could not be any problems in understanding this unless the problem lay in accepting that this is, once again, the largest constituent?s show.

 Appearing on television the other day, RSP leader Debabrata Bandopadhyay spoke of how N. Chandrababu Naidu?s insistence on industrialization brought about his downfall at the hustings. He conveniently ignored the fact that there can be no way in which the situation in the two states can be compared. Naidu had totally ignored the rural areas whereas the CPI(M), and thus the Left Front, has ensured a solid base in the countryside. Also, can it be anybody?s argument that the chief minister and his party will do anything that would weaken that base? On the other hand, it is their confidence in the strength of their rural support that is allowing the Marxists to take steps that may appear risky to the casual observer.

 Leaders of the RSP and the Forward Bloc are of course not casual observers. Apart from seeking to appease their own cadre, they are also eyeing the reported differences of opinion within the CPI(M) on the issue, hoping this will give them some leverage within the front. But here they ignore a central fact. West Bengal is the state from where the CPI(M), at the national level, derives its maximum strength, and the politburo would not have allowed Bhattacharjee to proceed unless it was sure that the party would not suffer because of this. The party may be charged with doublespeak but as Prakash Karat said recently, ?Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has to run a government and he has to take decisions accordingly.? No real comfort for the smaller constituents there.

 Questions have also been raised about the antecedents of the Salim group. In the days to come, some may point out that the group rose with the active support of General Suharto, whose hands are red with the blood of thousands of Indonesian communists, including that of D.N. Aidit. But industrialization needs money and where is Bhattacharjee expected to find a ?communist capitalist?? And if the Salim group can make motor cycles then why not a special economic zone or a township for it? Yes, it would perhaps have been better if the money had come from indigenous sources but Rs 40,000-50,000 crore is too much to be looked for at home.

 And what about Mamata Banerjee? The lady has come out with the theory that the main purpose of the CPI(M ) is to get funds from the ?promoters? as the polls are approaching. As usual, a pedestrian argument which deserves no examination. As for her overtures to the RSP and Forward Bloc, she has walked the same road in the past. So nothing new there either.

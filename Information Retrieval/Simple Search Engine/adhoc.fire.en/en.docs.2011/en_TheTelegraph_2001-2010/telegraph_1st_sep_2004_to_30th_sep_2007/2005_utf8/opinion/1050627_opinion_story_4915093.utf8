 ACROSS A RIVER

 It could be wrong to be over-optimistic about the outcome of the recent talks between the foreign secretaries of India and Bangladesh. Too many issues between the two countries have remained unresolved for too long to expect an early turnaround. The issues range from security concerns, border management, sharing of river water and illegal migration to trade imbalance and cross-border terrorism. And the two countries have not seen eye to eye on most of these issues. If New Delhi?s attitude to Dhaka hardened in recent years, it was primarily because of the latter?s persistent refusal to respond to Indian perceptions of security threats originating across the border. Dhaka has persistently denied the presence of anti-India elements operating from Bangladesh or the fact of migration. Obviously, such an attitude did not help matters. That explains why no Indian prime minister visited Dhaka in the last six years and why the present prime minister of Bangladesh, Ms Khaleda Zia, did not visit India even once during the last four years. New Delhi had sent out a strong signal of its position by forcing twice the postponement of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation summit in Dhaka. 

 What the meeting of the foreign secretaries achieved this time could mark a new beginning. This is suggested by the agreements to revive the work of the joint rivers commission and the working groups on trade and border management. This, despite the fact that the joint statement issued after the meeting gives enough indication of unresolved issues, particularly those relating to cross-border terrorism and the fencing of the border by India. Some of Dhaka?s complaints, though, need greater attention from New Delhi. India could do more to ease tariff and non-tariff barriers on import of Bangladeshi goods, thereby reducing the trade gap. Earlier moves by India to withdraw such barriers proved too little too late for Dhaka. New Delhi should also take Dhaka?s concerns into confidence while implementing the river-linking project. After all, Bangladesh?s anxieties as a lower riparian state cannot be wished away. Now that the two sides have agreed to resume talks on trade and the rivers, it is possible to hope for a better diplomatic climate. But a substantive improvement in relations is possible only if Dhaka acts on India?s security concerns.

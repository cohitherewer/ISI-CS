 DIFFICULT BATTLES

 Under a Stalinist sky

 Ivan?s War: The Red Army 1939-45 By Catherine Merridale, Faber, ? 15

 It was Stalin?s soldiers who tore the heart out of the Third Reich during World War II. Despite deploying 80 per cent of the Wehrmacht in the Eastern Front, the Nazis lost the war. Numerous monographs harped on the strategic, tactical and technical issues involved in the Russo-German war. But, in Ivan?s War, Catherine Merridale, professor of contemporary history at London University, asks the question: why did the muzhiks fight for the Stalinist regime at all?

 Western sociologists assert that group dynamics resulted in primary bonding among the personnel within the military formations. And primary group solidarity kept the soldiers going in the heat of battle. However, generation of primary bonds required the personnel within the unit to get acquainted with each other over a considerable period. This was possible in the British army in which men served with their friends in particular regiments throughout their lives. But, in the Eastern Front, due to heavy casualties suffered by the Red Army, the men had no chance to know their ?buddies?. So, ?buddy feeling? did not keep the Red soldiers together during the firefight.

 Another group of scholars emphasizes the role of ideology and charismatic leaders in motivating the soldiers to encounter the deadly face of battle. After all, the Soviet state constructed an elaborate monitoring network for indoctrinating the frontoviks. It was the duty of the political commissars to disseminate Marxist-Leninist principles among the Red soldiers.

 Merridale has interviewed many veterans and analyzed war-time letters written to folks back home. What comes out is that the Red soldiers gave little thought to Stalin and communism when the bullets started flying. Due to the fear of the hated NKVD and SMERSH officials, who continually monitored the activities of the forntline troops, the latter did not defy the political lectures openly. However, the speeches of the party bosses? were taken with a pinch of salt.

 The picture that appears from the data collected by Merridale shows that the Soviet peasants had no option but to join the Red Army and go on fighting till death. Life for the common peasants was extremely hard in the countryside. There never was adequate food after collectivization. In the army, the soldiers at least got a bellyful of cabbage soup, and their families got ration cards. But the families of those soldiers who had retreated or surrendered to the Germans were sent to the Gulags. Even those who did not care much for their families had no chance to escape. Special units equipped with machine pistols guarded the rear of the battlefield to shoot potential deserters.

 Despite the official myth, anti-Semitism and prejudice against minority communities fractured the Soviet society. Suspected communities like the Tajiks and the Jews ended up in labour camps deep inside Siberia. The only way to redeem onself and to earn a position for one?s family within the mainstream was to volunteer for military service. The reward was to serve, with criminals, in punishment battalions, equivalent to modern-day suicide squads.

 Merridale shows the transformation of attitudes of the Russian soldiers. During 1941-42, at least some Russians were fired by a nationalistic urge to save their motherland. But by late 1944, when the Red Army was advancing in east Europe, the temptations for soldiers were plunder and women.

 Merridale?s lucid narrative, based mostly on interviews, reveals the mindset of men in battle. Amid blood and gore, the baser instincts drove men forward. Pressurized by a brutal system, Soviet soldiers underwent further barbarization and continued the struggle till Berlin fell.

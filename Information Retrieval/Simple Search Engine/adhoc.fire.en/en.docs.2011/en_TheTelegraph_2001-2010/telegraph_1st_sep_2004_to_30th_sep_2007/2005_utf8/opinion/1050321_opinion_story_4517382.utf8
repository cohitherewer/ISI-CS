 READ BY RULE

 Rules governing universities should be universal. Or close to that. This seems to be the rationale behind the public interest litigation brought to the Supreme Court, which prompted the court to nullify the establishment of 117 universities under the Chhattisgarh Establishment of Universities Act. Ninety of these, set up during Mr Ajit Jogi?s tenure as chief minister, had been closed by the Bharatiya Janata Party government that followed Mr Jogi?s, and the Supreme Court has ordered that the remaining 27 should be closed too. The PIL was brought by the former chairman of the University Grants Commission, Mr Yashpal, and a few others. The UGC has laid down basic infrastructural requirements for an institution to be called a university, and even private universities have to fulfil these conditions in order to gain ?official? status. The court has left nothing to speculation; it has struck down the Chhattisgarh act itself as ?null and void?.

 The state legislation appears to have bypassed some of the requirements and ?negated? the UGC?s role in recognizing universities. This is a peculiar situation. Education is a concurrent subject, and the UGC, which ?recognizes? universities, is a fund-giving body. What would recognition or ?official? status of a university signify at a time in which the setting up of private universities is being encouraged and the Supreme Court itself is insisting on autonomy for universities and a reduction in government interference? Especially since private universities do not rely on UGC funding. On a practical level, certain basic requirements for a university are necessary, and a private enterprise with no accountability may turn out to be merely a lucrative business for a handful of people. But in a case like Chhattisgarh?s, the state must bear full responsibility for the outcome of an act passed by its legislature. Dishonest trading in education can be caught and punished ? on a case by case basis. According to the Supreme Court judgment, the establishment of private universities not based on UGC guidelines ?is bound to create havoc with the system of higher education in the country?. It would be difficult to state, though, that university education throughout the country is of the same standard, or that there is any country where it is so. Perhaps it is time to consider whether private education needs a prefect to keep it up to imaginary scratch.

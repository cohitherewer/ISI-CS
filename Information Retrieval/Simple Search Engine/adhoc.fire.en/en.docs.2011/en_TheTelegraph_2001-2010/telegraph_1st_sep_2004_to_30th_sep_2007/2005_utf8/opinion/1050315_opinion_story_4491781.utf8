 NOBODY?S CHILDREN

 For the disabled women in Orissa, domestic violence is a horror they have to cope with in silence, writes Debabrata Mohanty

 Way of the world

 Sunita?s (name changed) birth had brought little joy to her parents. They were disappointed to know that their only child, born in the coastal district of Jagatsinghpur, had a speech and hearing impairment. But what shattered them was the discovery that she was mentally challenged as well. There was more bad luck in store for Sunita. She lost her mother at the tender age of 12.

 After the death of her mother, Sunita?s father, a clerk in a school, used to go to office leaving her alone at home. Feeling suffocated within the four walls of her home, Sunita started venturing out. But there was no one to guide her in the big bad world outside, and Sunita was soon raped by some miscreants, which resulted in her becoming pregnant. Her father had her aborted, but since no one took care of Sunita, not even her father?s second wife, she was pregnant again. Sunita was forced to undergo sterilization eventually. There was now nothing she could hold on to for support. 

 It is a familiar situation for many of the disabled women in Orissa, who constitute 50 per cent of the 40 lakh disabled population in the state. Lonely and helpless, these women are increasingly becoming victims of violence. In a largely conservative and poor Orissa, these women are mostly viewed with contempt and pity. While domestic violence in the state has been an issue for women?s groups, the extent of such violence perpetrated against disabled women was unknown till a Bhubaneswar-based organization, Swabhiman (with funds from Oxfam India Trust), undertook a survey in 12 of the 30 districts of the state. The results released last month showed that 67 per cent of those with orthopaedic, visual or hearing impairment were beaten for no apparent reason. In case of the mentally challenged women, the figure was higher.

 Disabled women ? both married and unmarried ? are used as scapegoats or as an outlet for anger and irritation. Of the 729 women interviewed during the survey ? 595 with physical disability and 134 with mental disability in the age group of 18 to 40 ? almost half said that they had been slapped, hit, kicked or beaten by their husbands at some time. Parents, husbands and close family members were the most common perpetrators of emotional or physical abuse for both groups. Deaf women, as also those who are mentally challenged, were sexually abused by family members and close friends. ?While the people with disabilities are at the end of the priority list in our society, their parents are the most apathetic lot,? said Shruti Mohapatra, secretary general of Swabhiman. 

 There were even more shocking details. More than 12 per cent of the physically-challenged women have been raped and 15 per cent molested while the count is 25 per cent and 19 per cent respectively for the mentally-challenged women. More horrifyingly, the abusers were often family members or people whom the girls trusted a lot. Lima (name changed) from Bolangir was raped by her brother. When she told her family about it, they refused to believe her and even accused her of fantasizing. Mentally-challenged, Mona (name changed), can often be seen roaming around her village, uncared for. The 23-year-old girl has been raped twice. On both counts, her family members had her pregnancy terminated. 

 Only 30 per cent of the respondents in the survey were married, indicating the lack of interest on the part of the parents of the disabled women to get their daughters married. The possibility of not being considered sexual beings (and therefore being deprived of the right to bring up a family) was directly proportional to how evident the disability was. Marriage, quite evidently, did not improve matters. Around 44 per cent of the women were kicked during pregnancy while 12 per cent were threatened that they would be burnt alive by their husbands. Thirty per cent of the physically assaulted victims in fact required medical care.

 Around 22.6 per cent of the women confessed to being beaten up at home. ?Probably the single biggest factor affecting the incidence of family violence against women with disabilities is the size concept of these women?s families. Women with disabilities often depend on a variety of people to provide them with assistance in carrying out their everyday lives,? said Mohapatra.

 The study found that only 65 per cent of the physically disabled and 58.7 of the mentally challenged women got to eat three meals. It also revealed the dark truth about the social isolation of the mentally challenged in their own homes. Whereas only 40 per cent got an opportunity to dine with the family, less than 25 per cent had a chance to cook, which is a very common growing-up activity for a girl child in Orissa.

 There are other disturbing revelations ? only 19 per cent of the mentally-challenged women got an opportunity to participate in social gatherings and 26 per cent in religious festivities. ?It is a grim reflector of the apathy with which they are treated,? says Mohanty.

 The tales are depressing. The survey team of Swabhiman found that Trupti (name changed), a wheelchair-bound girl, had not been taking dinner for the last eight years. Both Trupti?s legs are affected by polio. When she was approached by the survey team, she revealed that she did not feel hungry during the night. But after a few probing queries she disclosed that she was in the habit of going to the toilet after dinner, which was an irritation for her parents. So the parents decided on a simple solution to the problem ? to stop giving her the meal at night.

 Domestic violence has a powerful impact on women with disabilities. Things can improve, provided policy changes allow the identification of the women who are in abusive situations. The guarantee of protection against physical and sexual violence must be available to the disabled. Police officers, counsellors and service providers need to be trained to assist disabled victims who are subjected to domestic violence. If community workers are adequately trained, they could help these women combat the daily violence and take better control of their lives.

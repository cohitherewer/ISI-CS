 OFF THE FRAME

 The economic reform agenda will remain perpetually and woefully incomplete unless it is accompanied by another project to reform the government. Nobody realizes this need more than the pioneer of economic reforms in India, Mr Manmohan Singh. Ever since he became prime minister, he has been trying to bring about changes in the structure and functioning of the government. Any attempt to do this entails a change in the attitude of bureaucrats. The bureaucracy in India is stuck inside the steel frame created by the British Indian administrations. This is an arcane world with its own priorities and protocols. It is run on the principle of seniority and not on the basis of merit. Senior posts are enjoyed without a fixed tenure being assigned to the person holding the post. Mr Singh is very keen to set two-year tenures for the key appointments in the departments of finance, defence, home, foreign affairs and other important ministries. This is not something that has the approval of the bureaucracy. Similarly, when senior officers are appointed in the various departments, the specialization and experience of the candidates are seldom taken into consideration. Thus, an officer with no experience in finance could end up, on grounds of his seniority, as a mandarin in the finance ministry.

 Mr Singh has expressed a desire to change all this and create a structure that is flexible, transparent and more geared to performance and merit. The problem lies in the situation where the bureaucrats are responsible for implementing proposals that directly affect their career prospects. It is more than likely that bureaucrats, accustomed to the rituals and practices of the steel frame, will stonewall attempts that take them out of that steel frame. It is the old question of who guards the guards in a different form. Who implements proposals when the implementors disapprove of the proposals? And bureaucrats, as viewers and readers of Yes Minister will recall, have innumerable ways of stalling a proposal while at the same time paying lip service to the principle behind the proposal. Mr Singh has an advantage in that he was once a bureaucrat and he is aware of most of the delaying tactics that are deployed to thwart change. The political will of Mr Singh to push through reforms in government faces a formidable challenge. But this is the most creative challenge of his prime ministership.

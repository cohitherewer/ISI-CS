 WHAT NOW?

 Why does anything that the West Bengal government has to say about air pollution sound wickedly farcical? The state government?s credibility on this issue is perhaps at its lowest now. (Not that Calcuttans seem terribly bothered about the fact that they are being made to breathe fatally unclean air for years.) Hence, the latest announcement about banning pre-1990 commercial vehicles from the city?s roads by the end of this year will be met with deep scepticism or indifference. Apparently, the relevant laws have been amended so that the courts cannot veto the ban, which has been endorsed by the environment secretary and the state pollution control board. 

 The government should really, by now, be wary of appearing more criminally ridiculous by creating more regulations and setting more deadlines. Every crucial deadline regarding auto-emission has been extended, missed or simply forgotten about over the last few years. This has made a mockery of not only the state?s political will regarding controlling pollution, but also of the courts? vigilance over the entire matter. Auto-emission norms have been played around with ad nauseam to suit every populist contingency. The Bharat II regulations, for instance, have been made conveniently pass?. And last July, there was talk about taking some vehicles off the roads, not so much to reduce emission as to cut down the frequency of road accidents in the city because of vehicular overcrowding. Nothing came of that as well. This latest ban, which brings the cut-off point forward from 1975 to 1990, will affect thousands of taxis, buses, autos and minibuses, and tens of thousands of goods vehicles. So the scale of disruption created by this ban, and therefore the firmness and efficiency required to enforce it make it all the more difficult to believe that the government will be able to make any real difference with this new ruling. Besides, there is an exit clause which allows these vehicles to remain on the roads if they convert to LPG. And this brings the whole situation back to square one, because there will simply not be enough LPG outlets in the state to meet this demand, giving vehicle-owners the opportunity to maintain status quo. Apathy, corruption, inefficiency and callousness have thus effectively ensured that Calcuttans will continue to breathe deadly air and get regularly crushed on the roads under vintage monsters.

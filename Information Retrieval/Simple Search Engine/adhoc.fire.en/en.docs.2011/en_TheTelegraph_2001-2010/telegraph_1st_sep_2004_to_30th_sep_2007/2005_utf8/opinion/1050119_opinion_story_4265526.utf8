 WHAT THE WAVES LEFT BEHIND 

 Looking at the child victims of the 

 tsunami, Ram Ramgopal hopes that something good comes 

 of all the attention that is now focussed on them

 Can?t help being 

 happy 

 I have covered wars. I have covered 

 situations where I have often feared for my life. In this 

 instance, I don?t think I was scared of being killed by 

 some random bullet or being shot at by an insurgent. But 

 the difference here was that you are face to face with people 

 who have lost everything and the suffering is very much 

 in your face at every turn.

 We have seen a lot of children 

 on our trips through these camps, but many of the children 

 actually died when the tsunami struck. There are others 

 who have been orphaned, some who are in a situation where 

 they have come to these camps with strangers ? in some instances 

 with other families or relatives. The thing that strikes 

 you when you look at these children is that some of them 

 appear to have a sense of sadness in their eyes. Others 

 appear to be like normal children anywhere wherein they 

 are playing with their friends or just with the other children 

 at the camps.

 It is certainly a very hard and 

 trying situation in terms of health, hygiene and the fact 

 that many of these people have to basically rely on the 

 goodness of other people for food. In some instances, for 

 their clothes. And it is a trying time for the adults. For 

 the children, of course, it depends on what age they are. 

 I mean, certainly a sense exists that many of these affected 

 people almost don?t know how to really cope. At one camp 

 we went to, there was one girl who had a deep sense of sadness 

 in her eyes and a broken arm. She also had a black eye but 

 it appeared that there was something else. We asked her 

 about her family, whether they were okay and she said, ?Yes 

 my father?s alright, my mother, they tell me, is in a hospital.? 

 Of course she was just looking at us as if we might be able 

 to tell her more but obviously we knew nothing and were 

 just looking at her, trying to reassure her. These are the 

 kind of things that stick in your mind after a time like 

 this.

 In some ways, it would appear 

 that some of them are very resilient, certainly the children. 

 The younger kids seem very happy. They appear to be walking 

 around, playing; there certainly isn?t a sense of loss ? 

 at least in the camps. I mean it?s just like childhood ? 

 continuous. But someone looking at it from the outside would 

 feel otherwise, that these kids have been deprived; you 

 end up noticing more than perhaps you know they themselves 

 do. Some of them think of this as just another fun experience. 

 There were a couple of stories 

 that I do remember. One involved two girls, two cousins, 

 who were perhaps in their early teens and they came up to 

 us and the first thing they wanted to know was what we do 

 and they wanted to talk to us to find out why we were there. 

 We explained we were television journalists and they kept 

 peppering us with questions such as what we do, do we speak 

 this language. We would like to converse with them. There 

 was a sense that they wanted to carry on a normal conversation. 

 We were there for a different 

 purpose, so it was at first a bit difficult to figure out 

 where exactly the conversation was leading but it appeared 

 that these two girls wanted to have a real conversation. 

 During the conversation, one of them turned to me and said, 

 ?Why do you think we are so happy?? I didn?t think they 

 were particularly happy, I just thought they were being 

 very friendly, so I said, ?No, I don?t know why you?re so 

 happy.? 

 They said, ?You know if we aren?t 

 happy then there?s nothing left to live for and this is 

 what we want to continue to keep in our minds. We want to 

 be happy.? Next they asked me, ?How would you feel if you 

 were in a situation like this?? That question caught me 

 by surprise; I didn?t know what it meant. What struck me 

 most was that these two girls were so engaging and so charming, 

 and yet perhaps had a very sad story to tell.

 I don?t think one can be neutral 

 in these instances. In many ways, what you are doing is 

 chronicling what is happening around you. I think as a human 

 being just as you feel for people who have suffered, you 

 feel for kids as well. You feel for the children who have 

 lost their parents. You also feel for the parents who have 

 lost other family members. 

 I don?t think at any point one 

 can be neutral. In fact, I think if there is anything, you 

 are very sympathetic about their situation, but it?s also 

 hard because you are trying to see whether what you do will 

 make a difference to their lives. Whether what you report 

 can bring some change or whether just reporting on one individual 

 somewhere in one tiny corner of the region is going to have 

 an impact on anything else. One is never sure, but one does 

 try to, I think quite consciously, look for ways to ease 

 the pain that these people are going through.

 My daughter is four-years-old 

 and she is really very much in my thoughts through the day 

 at every turn. I look at the situation in these camps and 

 that?s the first thing that comes to mind. My instinct as 

 a father is to protect my children, my daughter in this 

 instance. And I have to ensure that she has a better life, 

 that she will never need to worry about anything. 

 Then you look at these children 

 and you wonder who is there who feels that way about them? 

 Perhaps a relative might want to take care of them but do 

 they feel the same sense of bonding a father or a mother 

 feels? And that to me makes it harder to get over the idea 

 that these children are perhaps left with no bonds.

 Covering the story from India 

 ? which is no stranger to adversity, where at every turn 

 you see poverty and people in distress, where natural disasters 

 are common and they usually end up in large-scale suffering 

 and loss of life ? perhaps the only good thing is that people 

 seem to have some sort of resilience and are able to overcome 

 their trials and tribulations. 

 For the children that you see 

 here, in some ways the attention of the outside world being 

 focused on them, to my mind, is heartening. Because if some 

 of them have not had such a happy childhood, perhaps this 

 disaster might be that turning point, perhaps something 

 good might emerge out of this.

 BROUGHT TO TEST

 Inability to cope with the pressure and fear of work in school is at the root of much juvenile unhappiness. This is not just a question of how much students have to learn and how early, but also of the methods of evaluation they are subjected to. Hence, assessment is a vital, yet problematic part of the education of the young, and it is reassuring to see that some schools in the city are beginning to think and act differently with regard to this. The changes they are making to how they assess their students up to class V are still too new to yield empirical results. But they are founded on unexceptionable principles. Graded annual and terminal examinations on individual subjects will only instil in children a sense of competition. This could either result in an aggressively functional ?success?-oriented approach to learning, or a sense of failure fostered not by a child?s natural self-image, but one that has been imposed on him or her by an arbitrarily determined system. So, continuous assessment, doing away with grades and examinations until class V become part of a more humane and organic pedagogy that attempts to eliminate fear and pressure.

 Such innovations are laudable, but can be afforded by schools which have a manageable number of students on whom to sustain these methods, as well as the necessary infrastructure within which such a system must function. Most of the schools venturing into this new pedagogy are fairly elite, urban private schools. Widening the scope of these innovations to include government schools in the cities, towns, districts and villages is still quite unthinkable. Continuous assessment requires highly trained, committed teachers who can afford the luxury of treating each student as an individual. Besides, if innovations in primary education are not properly in sync with secondary and later stages of higher education, then even the best methods might produce youngsters who are disorientated ? and hence, disadvantaged ? with regard to these realities. Pathological competitiveness, born out of unmanageable numbers, remains, however, an unavoidable part of Indian higher education. And most parents and teachers may still be unable to shield their children from having to face this sooner or later.

 Paperback Pickings

 Now for some naked truths

 A Space of Her Own (Sage, Rs 340) edited by Leela Gulati and Jasodhara Bagchi is inspired by Susan Cahill?s famous 1994 anthology of autobiographical narratives by 20th century American women writers, and works just as well as a compilation of the ?personal narratives? of 12 eminent women in India. The aim here is to focus on the relationship among three successive generations of women and to delineate the ?emotional lines of matriliny within the social structure of patriliny?. As the editors admit, this proves difficult. But the broad theme that emerges from the intensely personal accounts of Nabaneeta Dev Sen, Zarina Bhatty, Mary Roy, Vijaya Mehta, Priti Desai, Vina Mazumdar, Bagchi herself and others, is the way the individual struggles of their mothers, grandmothers, grandaunts and other renegade predecessors for a personal space within an often oppressive domestic set-up inspired them to make their own decisions about their own lives. An excellent volume, made doubly desirable by its publication in the moderately-priced paperback.

 Patna Roughcut (Picador, Rs 250) by Siddharth Chowdhury is about nothing in particular. Ritwik Ray is a small-time reporter in Patna, and recounts nostalgically his growing-up amid the Bengali diaspora in Patna colonies and Delhi University campuses. There is Harryda, his dreams in technicolour, Iladi who attained at 13 the wisdom ?very few women attain even at menopause?. Then there are those typical years in college, full of love and idealism. And finally Mira Verma, who Ritwik meets again as wife of his professor. A rather tame start for a first novel.

 What we All Need (Invisible Man, Rs 295) by Richard Crasta is an insufferable, smart-alecky exposition on Indian sexual habits ? ?naked truths? in a ?naked? language, as the writer puts it. But nothing could be more forced. In his bid to make up for five long years of silence (thank god, there was some), Crasta rambles on recklessly about his own sexual escapades, the bounty of ?unsafe love? (condoms apparently are useless in a poor country, where it does not matter whether one lives or dies), and what he thinks people actually need (?a good f***?). Underlying the bluster is a profound anti-war philosophy though. ?The true obscenity is the senseless waging of war...brutal prisons...corruption...? Thanks for telling us Crasta.

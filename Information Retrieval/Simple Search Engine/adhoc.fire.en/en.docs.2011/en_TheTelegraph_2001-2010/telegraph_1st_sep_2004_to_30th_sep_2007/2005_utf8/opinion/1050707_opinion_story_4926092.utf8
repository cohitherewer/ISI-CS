 FISHING IN MUDDY WATERS

 Outfits like the Ulfa thrive because political parties find them useful, writes Sumanta Sen

 Brothers in arms

 The June 20 blast at the secretariat at Guwahati was the latest act of violence committed by the United Liberation Front of Asom. It has once again exposed the dangers of the policy of partial appeasement which governments, both at Dispur and New Delhi, seem to be pursuing with regard to the Ulfa. Strangely enough, some people still seem to consider its members as ?misguided youths?.

 This is evident from the way in which they are being wooed to the discussion table. The writer from Assam who is working towards that end appears to be convinced that she is dealing with a few naughty boys who are prepared to change their ways. While she is entitled to her views even in the face of a reality that is entirely different, it is surprising that the state government should also resort to a kid-glove approach. Or perhaps it is not really surprising, given the history of the stand adopted by both the Congress and other political forces on the unrest in the state. Since trouble began in the state over two decades ago, these parties have never been seen to betray any awareness of the dangers involved and act accordingly. The left, particularly the Communist Party of India (Marxist), has always been much more forthright in its assertions ? first against the All Assam Students? Union-led agitation and now the Ulfa depredations, but then it is a small force in the state.

 Take the question of talks and the Ulfa?s reported insistence that these should be preceded by the release of all its members from prison. Till date, the Tarun Gogoi government has not been heard to say ?no? firmly. The reason seems to be clear: next year the state will go to the polls and as usual, the Congress does not want to lose any weapon that may come in handy then. Also, sub-nationalism always has a few takers, and the Congress is perhaps worried at what impact any firm action may have at election time. This mindset does not help to deal with a problem which is not political but one of law and order.

 It is not only the Congress that should be blamed. The socialists and the predecessors of today?s forces of Hindutva had also chosen to fish in the muddy waters of the Assam agitation. While the former was seeking a base for themselves, the latter had a bigger game plan. They saw in the agitation against ?foreigners? a perfect setting to kick off their wider movement against Muslims. If the Muslims from across the border (?foreigners?) were allowed to upset demographic patterns, their dream of a Hindu rashtra could not be realized. When the Asom Gana Parishad was formed, through a merger of the Aasu with outfits like the Purbanchaliya Loka Parishad, and it decided to contest the elections, the slogan in Nagaon was ?kaan me bidi, muh me paan, mian jaot Pakistan? (Mian, with bidi behind your ear and paan in your mouth, go back to Pakistan).

 That was quite some years ago. But have attitudes changed? The parties still have the same urge to use the trouble-makers to suit their political ends. The Ulfa, of course, is not the Aasu or the PLP, it is a cohesive militant unit seeking succour in the land of the same hated ?foreigners?. But the desire to derive fringe benefits from the unrest, particularly at poll time, remains strong. Such benefits had been sought and received earlier too. And not just in Assam, but also in Manipur and Nagaland. Insurgency is not all that bad so far as some political parties are concerned. Interestingly, the parties which fail to garner such support, adopt holier-than-thou attitudes and blame the other side.

 Coming back to Assam and the demand for the release of the prisoners. While taking a decision, it will perhaps be useful if both Gogoi and Shivaraj Patil keep in mind the experience of Nripen Chakravarti when he was the chief minister of Tripura. He had taken a gamble and released Bijoy Hrangkhawl, chief of the Tripura National Volunteers. Hrangkhawl had been given money to rehabilitate himself and return to the mainstream. What happened? Within a short time, Hrangkhawl disappeared from his home at Ambasa village. Talking to this writer, the chief minister had insisted that he had not fled, but had been ?kidnapped? by his former colleagues. But he had no explanation as to how the ?kidnappers? could give his wife time to pack all their belongings, including her cosmetics box. It has always been the same story with most of those laying down arms amidst a lot of fanfare and then decamping after a few days? rest. In the case of Ulfa, there is all the more possibility of history repeating itself, with Anup Chetia and others comfortably ensconced in Dhaka and elsewhere across the eastern border.

 As for ?talks? with the Ulfa, what has happened to the discussions with the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah)? It is now evident that the outfit and the government had all along been talking at cross-purposes. It can be said with a fair degree of certainty that the powwows with the Ulfa will not lead to anything positive as long as the outfit is there to serve the purpose of other larger forces. There is no point in recalling the talks with Laldenga which brought peace to Mizoram. With the collapse of East Pakistan, Laldenga and his outfit had lost their shelter and had few other options than talking.

 So the blasts and killings will continue. Unless there is determined action to counter the Ulfa, and only the army has the capacity to do so. Operation Rhino could have become a success, but it was called off. The action against Ulfa camps in Bhutan should have been followed up, but was not. In Nagaland, village after village has been uprooted in search of militants. In Assam, however, action has always been somewhat apologetic and quick to be called off. Is it because the Nagas had been seen as a ?different people? and the Assamese as ?our brothers? because the situation there offers a great deal to sections of the political establishment?

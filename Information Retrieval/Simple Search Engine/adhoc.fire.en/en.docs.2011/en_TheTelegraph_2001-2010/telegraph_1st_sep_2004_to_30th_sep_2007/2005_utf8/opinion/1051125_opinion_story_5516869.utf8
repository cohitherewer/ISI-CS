 A WRONGLY MIXED POTION

 Asterix and the Falling Sky 

 By Albert Uderzo, 

 Orion, ? 5.50

 One of the charms of the Asterix stories was that they deliberately avoided seeking out contemporary relevance. Goscinny (as long as he was alive) and Uderzo chose to tell tales of a Gaulish village battling it out against Roman conquerors. Their saviour is a druid, Getafix, who made a magic potion to make the villagers indomitable. The fun of the stories lay in the situations, in the word play of the dialogue, in the choice of proper names and, most endearingly, in the doings of the cunning Asterix, the warrior, and Obelix, the menhir delivery man who fell into the magic potion as a baby and was thus endowed with super human strength.

 In this latest adventure, Uderzo deviates from the script and the sky thus indeed falls on the heads of Asterix fans. Uderzo laces the story with elements of science fiction and with echoes of the Iraq war. Aliens from another galaxy descend on the village to seize the secret weapon the Gauls possess. It does not work. It is difficult to imagine the innocent Gauls in the image of Saddam Hussein, and to see the magic potion as the Iraqi tyrant?s weapon of mass destruction. Neither are the aliens in their strange machines quite akin to George Bush and his marauders.

 The major disappointment of this story is that it does not raise a single laugh. What could be more damaging for an Asterix adventure story? There isn?t a single pun or a single phrase that remains in the mind. The episode that shows one of the aliens becoming Mr Big in size after drinking one of Getafix?s potions is not even clever. It is also derived from a previous adventure.

 The lesson is obvious. Asterix and Co. are best left in 50 BC, away and safe from the dangers of modern science and modern politics. They have a tough time holding out against the Romans. Let them not be burdened with other enemies, especially anachronistic ones. 

 Monsieur Uderzo, please leave the simple and indomitable people alone and to their own magical devices to combat threats. They manage quite well. Also let the Asterix fans laugh again.

 TENANTS AT WILL

 A recent judgment of the Supreme Court has highlighted the mess that prevails in the sphere of property rents in Calcutta. For a property at the heart of the city?s commercial district, the landlord has been receiving a rent that was fixed in 1939 and has not been revised since. The tenants have sublet the premises and continue to enjoy rents that are far in excess of the rent they pay the actual owner of the property. The Supreme Court has taken a step to redress the gross and obvious inequity. It has asked the tenants, a commercial enterprise, to pay rent at the rate of Rs 15 per square feet. But this is only a step in the right direction. The prevailing rent in the area, for the property in question, has been calculated to be in the range of Rs 30 per square feet. In its attempt to clear the mess, the Supreme Court has only gone half way. The apex court must have good reasons not to allow the market rate to come into play but the court?s judgment not only draws attention to an absurd situation but it also provokes thought on the broader issues involved.

 The problem with any discussion on the subject of rent is that it tends to get confused with the issue of poverty and deprivation. There is no doubt that the impoverished and the deprived have problems in urban areas with regard to cheap housing. But the number of legal cases that come out of this is nothing compared to the cases of tenants who are in a position to pay higher rents but will not do so by taking advantage of outmoded rent control laws. These cases need special attention and need to be brought under the purview of market forces. It is well known that once a dispute between landlord and tenant goes to court, it takes years to get resolved. The victim of this legal process is always the landlord since he continues to receive rent at the old rate. A way out of this situation is to make the landlord-tenant relationship strictly contractual. This will simplify matters, reduce the burden on the courts and also prevent a drain on public resources. The introduction of the law of contract into property rent should not be difficult in the large number of instances that involve corporate tenants. The state should come into the picture only to protect tenants who are below the poverty line. Thus the introduction of market forces will be given a human face. The verdict of the Supreme Court has wider and deeper ramifications.

 Young electorate may register their protest by not voting

 Come 05/05/05, election day in Britain, a defeat for the Labour party would be an even bigger surprise than Vajpayee?s ouster last May. Amit Roy reports from London

 Just as nasbandi ? forced sterilisation ? proved to be Mrs Gandhi?s nemesis in 1977, so also Iraq could turn out to be Tony Blair?s undoing in 2005. Seldom have the British people been so angry with a Prime Minister. In the closing stages of the campaign for the general election on May 5, the issue of whether Blair was right to take Britain into war against Saddam Hussein has come back to haunt him. It is unfortunate for the Prime Minister, but a gift to his critics, that the simple juxtaposition of two letters in his surname changes Blair into ?Bliar?.

 Is the Prime Minister a ?liar?, then? This is the charge that the Tory leader, Michael Howard, fighting a desperate campaign, has levelled against Blair.

 The Daily Express, a right-wing newspaper, had this to say on page one a few days ago on the furious reaction of army families who have lost loved ones in Iraq: ?Our Sons Died For Lies: Families of dead heroes condemn Blair.?

 Could this be the same Daily Express which had been gung ho about the war, cheering Blair on to go into battle against Saddam?

 But then hypocrisy has always been a characteristic of British politics and the inmates of the Mother of Parliaments.

 Considering the hard time Blair has been given by all and sundry, from ordinary voters on the campaign trail to TV inquisitors out to make a name for themselves, it would be easy to assume he is going to lose. 

 ?His greatest friend is Michael Howard,? is all Lord Swraj Paul, the Labour peer, will say.

 There is no doubt that Blair has become a very unpopular Prime Minister. If he wins on May 5 ? and a defeat would be an even bigger surprise than Vajpayee?s ouster ? it will be because most voters cannot countenance the prospect of Howard becoming Prime Minister.

 Thumbs down 

 What is most depressing about the current state of British politics is the utter disenchantment with politicians. There is such incomprehension about Blair?s logic for forcing Britain into waging a war that people did not want, that on polling day up to 50 per cent of the electorate may register their protest by not voting at all. Among the young, this figure could be even higher. In a real sense, people feel disenfranchised.

 Howard made immigration the central plank of the early part of his campaign, thereby managing to sound virtually xenophobic and racist to a significant section of the British people. His own family fled to Britain from Romania before the Second World War to escape the persecution of Jews; yet, Howard has also made abuse of asylum laws (which certainly takes place) an important part of his manifesto. His father and grandfather, who entered Britain illegally before their permits were regularised, would probably have been denied entry if someone like him had been in charge.

 On the question of Iraq, Howard has accused Blair of being a ?liar? who did not tell the British people the truth of why he was going to war. But Howard, whatever he may say now, was also a cheerleader for the war. The Tory leader has thereby simply confused the electorate. Had he opposed the war from the start, as the Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, has done, it is possible that Howard might have won the election. 

 The consensus is that the British Prime Minister meekly followed President Bush?s decision to go to war. What Blair required was a justification because ?regime change? ? this was what Bush wanted ? would not stand up under international law. Hence, he came up with the claim that Saddam possessed weapons of mass destruction (WMD) which could be fired at Western interests within ?45 minutes?. 

 Now that no WMDs have been found, Blair has changed his reasons for going to war, now arguing that getting rid of Saddam was justified because he had breached numerous UN resolutions, had shown an unwillingness to disarm, could pose a future threat to the West and that his removal has made it possible for democratic elections to be held in Iraq.

 Calling the bluff

 Alas, for Blair, the nation is not impressed. His position has been weakened by the leak of written advice given to him by his Attorney General Lord Goldsmith, the government?s most senior law officer. On March 7, 2003, Goldsmith wrote to Blair pointing out the risks of going to war without a second UN resolution, specifically authorising the use of military force against Iraq. This advice was hidden from most members of the Cabinet. By March 17, Goldsmith ? he was obviously lent on ? had changed his mind, met the Cabinet and had given his view that war would be legal even without a second UN resolution. Blair got his way, the House of Commons voted for military action and Britain and America went to war.

 The problem for Blair is that most people do think he is a liar, although this term cannot be employed in parliamentary debate and is generally not used in British politics either. He has squirmed when put under pressure over Iraq, usually falling back on the line: ?You may disagree with me and many people do. I respect and understand their opposition but as Prime Minister, I took the decision I thought was right. I won?t apologise for it. It is now up to the British people to back me or sack me.?

 Other issues have been fiercely debated during the campaign ? the National Health Service, pensions, education, immigration and asylum ? but the main one has been Blair himself. Is he a man the nation can trust?

 The answer, after all that has come out over Iraq, is a resounding no. The difficulty is that the British appear to trust the Tories under Howard even less. This probably explains why all opinion polls still predict a Labour win, although with a reduced majority.

 Hobson?s choice

 To be sure, there are the Liberal Democrats who are striving to replace the Tories as the main opposition. But the fear, even among Muslims, who hate Blair the most, is that voting for the Lib Dems in many marginal seats would simply let in the Tories by the back door. 

 Blair has capitalised on this fear by stating: ?Vote Lib Dem ? and hand Michael Howard the keys to 10, Downing Street.? 

 If people still pick Labour on May 5, it will not be because of Blair, once his party?s greatest asset, but in spite of him. There is recognition deep down that compared with other economies in western Europe ? especially Germany where unemployment is very high ? Britain has performed relatively well.

 Interest rates are low as is unemployment. Economic growth has been unspectacular but steady under Gordon Brown, the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It is generally assumed that Blair, should he win, will hand over to Brown within the next two or three years. 

 ?Vote Blair, get Brown,? was how Howard?s campaign started.

 Then the Tory leader understood this was precisely what many wanted and so he quickly dropped this line.

 What is different about a British general election, compared especially with the ones in India, is that the battle is won or lost in the television studio. The senior politicians do travel around the country, concentrating on the marginal constituencies where the overall result will be decided. Most encounters with ?genuine voters? are stage managed but occasionally things go wrong. 

 In a shopping centre in Leeds, for example, 20-year-old Jessica Haigh told Blair that all her family members were staunch Labour supporters who had ?lost faith? in him.

 ?In 1997, I was 11 and we were so happy when you got in and now all our family?s trust in your party has gone,? she bluntly told the Prime Minister. ?It?s so heartbreaking.?

 The impression one gets is that Labour will lose a number of marginals because young people, especially at university, will vote Lib Dem as a protest over Iraq. But as to whether this will be enough to rob Blair of a majority is hard to tell.

 Power equations 

 From India?s point of view, it would probably be best if Blair is returned to power, say the Indian experts. The Indian government has a good working relationship with Blair and his ministers, many of whom have visited India and got to know their opposite numbers and the country. The Blair-Manmohan Singh talks at 10, Downing Street last September went well and laid down the framework for a much deeper and more equal relationship. 

 Blair has been to India twice (he even wore a Nehru jacket) and his wife, Cherie, is an enthusiastic supporter of Indian women?s groups. But such is the momentum of economic growth in India that a Tory government, too, would pick up where Labour left off. All in all, Indians in the UK like Blair at a personal level and would be happy to see him being returned. Whether history will judge Blair more kindly remains to be seen but many are looking forward to a change in skipper. 

 ?Gordon Brown, too, would be very pro-Indian,? Lord Paul says reassuringly.

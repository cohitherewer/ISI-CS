 Paperback Pickings

 From the edge of the upper circle 

the sunday philosophy club 

(Abacus, ? 2.50) by Alexander McCall Smith is a mutedly clever, 

philosophically knowing intelligent person?s detective novel set in modern, genteel 

Edinburgh, more Festival than Fringe. The detective is Isabel Dalhousie, and she 

edits the Review of Applied Ethics. She knows her Iris Murdoch (the moral 

philosopher rather than the novelist) and has certainly read Mary Midgeley?s Wickedness. 

When she sees a young man fall to his death in a concert hall ?from the the 

edge of the upper circle, from the gods...striking the edge of the grand circle? 

in order to ?disappear headfirst towards the stall below?, Isabel thinks first 

of Auden?s poem on Icarus, and then wonders if the man might have been given ?just 

a shove?. This is a quietly riveting novel, ultimately about compassion and forgiveness: 

?Settling a life, she thought; laying the dead to rest; allowing time and self-forgiveness 

to start.? McCall Smith is professor of medical law at the University of Edinburgh 

and was born in Zimbabwe.

pakistan: an age of violence 

(Sampark, Rs 250) edited by Anita Dawood Nasar is a special issue 

of the Sampark Journal of Global Understanding that collects essays, stories, 

paintings and poems by some of the best known names from the Pakistani intelligentsia 

who have reflected on themes that concern contemporary Pakistan, particularly 

violence induced by the ?worship of one dollarised god?.

armies of hanuman: book four 

of the ramayana (Penguin, Rs 350) by Ashok K. Banker is the 

fourth in Banker?s modern retelling of Rama?s story, and takes on his journey 

to the kingdom of Lanka. For Banker, this story is ?not about ?hindutva? and the 

politics of religion, but about ?inditva?, Indian pride, and a story too great 

to be saffronised or sanitised.? This is a hybrid retelling, in which Amar 

Chitra Katha meets Iravati Karve meets the modern fantasy blockbusters meet 

the Indian TV serial meets computer games. The prefatory author?s note shows wide 

reading, but the end-product is not-quite-sophisticated kitsch: ?Ravana 

lived. In the cosmic maelstrom of his mind...he saw through the eyes of rakshasas 

in the habitat,many miles above his private den-chamber, milling about in confusion 

as the news of their master?s reawakening rippled through Lanka like a sea-typhoon.?

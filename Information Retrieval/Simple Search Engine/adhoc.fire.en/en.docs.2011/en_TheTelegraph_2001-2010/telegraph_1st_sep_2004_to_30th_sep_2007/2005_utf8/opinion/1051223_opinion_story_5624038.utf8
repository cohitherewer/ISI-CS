 Trouble comes in waves

 Sir? The stampede among jostling flood-relief seekers in a Chennai school, which resulted in the death of at least 42 people, was tragic beyond measure (?Killing rush for flood cash?, Dec 18). The fact that the mad rush was the fallout of rumours regarding relief distribution points to the lack of a proper public announcement system. Had the authorities taken appropriate measures, many innocent lives could have been saved. The authorities? failure to avert such a disaster is shocking since this incident is a repetition of what had happened in front of a college in another Chennai locality some time ago. What is even more despicable, is that political parties always try to exploit a crisis by promising relief in return of votes. The hard-pressed people easily succumb to the lure, resulting in such mishaps. Instead of furthering their interests, the parties in power should try to help the people instead . The installation of a public address system might help the organizers to have control on unruly crowds in case things go out of control. Involving various NGOs which are experienced in handling relief operations might also be a good idea. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir? Tamil Nadu led the other states of India in post-tsunami relief efforts one year back. This time too, the administration has acted efficiently while dealing with natural calamities like cyclones and floods that have been threatening the state of late. Numerous lives were saved by the prompt action taken by government and non-government agencies. It is ironic that while the government could help in the case of natural disasters, it could do precious little to prevent man-made disasters like the stampedes in Chennai relief centres. In all probability, more lives were lost in the two incidents of stampede than the floods. The loss is all the more tragic as the incidents could have easily been avoided. One hopes that the administration would now take urgent measures to prevent such disasters from taking place in the near future. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir? The stampede in Chennai is proof of the inefficiency of relief personnel in the matter of disaster management. The police should be given proper training in handling such situations before they are allowed to join the force. One cannot allow people to die of human callousness, especially after they have survived the wrath of mother nature.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir? It is unfortunate that over 40 people lost their lives while they were waiting for the distribution of relief tokens to start in a Chennai school. Death by stampede has become a common enough occurrence in our country. Several women lost their lives during the distribution of saris by a politician in Lucknow last year. Another stampede had killed six women and injured 15 people in a Chennai college only a few days ago. Simply granting ex-gratia payments is not enough. The government needs to formulate guidelines to ensure that such tragedies are not repeated again. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The stampede in Chennai that resulted in the death of a number of relief seekers could have been avoided by stipulating a specific number of counters to cater to the needs of a certain number of families. It seems that the authorities have failed to learn their lesson from a similar incident that claimed the lives of six women in the same city recently. In the present case, only a handful of policemen were posted to manage a huge number of relief seekers. More important, none of the officials in charge of relief distribution were in sight when the people started queuing up. It would be criminal if the political parties now try to exploit this incident. The tragedy calls for a joint effort from all the parties to make sure that relief measures are handled carefully across the state. 

 Yours faithfully,

R. Sekar, Angul, Orissa 

 Sir ? Chennai was badly affected by heavy rains and the resultant floods made the situation worse. Now the stampede in one of the relief camps has added to the people?s woes. Many people were already starving in parts of the state due to inadequate relief operations. The stampede was the result of these people competing with each other to get access to relief material. Relief material always falls short whenever a natural disaster takes place. 

 The state government has announced an inquiry into the incident but that would be meaningless in this case. Such tragedies have taken place in flood-hit areas before and inquiries into those incidents have only lead to a colossal waste of the tax payers? money. Rather than ordering meaningless investigations, it would be better to ensure that there is sufficient relief material available for the affected people. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Mohd. Mudassir Alam, New Delhi

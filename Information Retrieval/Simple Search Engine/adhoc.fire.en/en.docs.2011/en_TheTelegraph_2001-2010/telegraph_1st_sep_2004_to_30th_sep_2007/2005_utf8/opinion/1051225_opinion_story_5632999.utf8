 Letters to Editor

 Naming game, again

 Sir ? Bombay becomes Mumbai, Madras becomes Chennai, Calcutta becomes Kolkata ? and now Bangalore is to become Bengaluru. Not to forget the scores of streets and buildings being renamed. India needs to focus on people?s welfare rather than waste time on the silly, juvenile game of changing names. Does ?Indian? in place of ?Indian Airlines? make the national carrier more nationalistic? Do the name-changes increase the per-capita loyalty of Indians, or their per-capita income? Here are a people with nothing better to do.

 Yours faithfully,

 Medha Dutt, Calcutta

 Parking space

 Sir ? We have had mayors of different hues in Calcutta. Some espoused the cause of the city?s beautification and greening, some the cause of holding fairs in the Maidan, and so on. Isn?t it ironical that at the time the state government has arranged for alternative locations for the holding of fairs to save the Maidan?s environment and to keep the greens free for young sportsmen, the mayor, Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya, is totally against parks being used for playing? To add to the irony, the mayor represents the state?s ruling party. One feels ashamed to think that this is happening when the sheriff of the city is one of the best-known sportsmen of yesteryear, Chuni Goswami. The Telegraph must be thanked for its sustained campaign to preserve the city?s greens. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sumant Poddar, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The drama over holding a fair in one of the prime public parks of south Calcutta, Deshapriya Park, is an eyewash. No fair could have been held in the park without a tacit understanding between the local councillor and the ruling party of the state, possibly the chief minister himself. It is no secret that most of the city?s councillors are more interested in helping promoters and businessmen in return for neat sums, rather than think about the welfare of their constituencies. Even those councillors who hail from the opposition parties are on back-scratching terms with the state?s ruling party. They come handy for each other at the time of the elections. 

 In the case of Deshapriya Park, the non-left councillor is clearly hand-in-glove with the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist). The issue is not whether the park should be used exclusively as a playground. Traditionally, the CPI(M) has done badly in the area, so keeping the local councillor in hand is a marvellous ploy. And what better way to do it than work behind the curtains to blow up a trivial issue and turn the councillor into a hero? Hopefully the people will see through all of it.

 Yours faithfully,

Sushant Chatterjee, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir ? After the harrowing time I had in Puri at the hands of the nulias, I felt it my duty to warn all would-be visitors about this new menace. On the morning of December 1, I went to the beach for a bath, along with my two grown-up sons. We bathed in waist-deep water. A little after I left the beach, leaving my sons behind, a group of five nulias jumped into the water, pulled my younger son out and brought him to the hotel, claiming Rs 5,000 for their ?rescue work?. When I refused, they started abusing us in front of the hotel. The authorities of Deep Resort, where we were staying, did not come to our defence, which can only indicate a covert understanding between them and the nulias. Finally, I had no option but to pay Rs 700 to the nulias, who even threatened my sons with worse consequences if we did not hire them for bathing. Only later did I learn that such incidents can be reported to the police station located behind Puri Hotel.

 Yours faithfully,

C.S. Naha, Calcutta

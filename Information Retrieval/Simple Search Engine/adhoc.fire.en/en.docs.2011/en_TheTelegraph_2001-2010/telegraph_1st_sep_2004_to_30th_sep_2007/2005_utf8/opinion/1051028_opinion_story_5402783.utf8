 Winning again 

 Sir ? The Nagpur one-day international finally presented Indian cricket fans with something to rejoice, especially since the team clicked as a unit, for once. Every top order batsman scored, and the bowlers did an excellent job. One wonders why the Indian team does not do well consistently, like the Australians. The new captain, Rahul Dravid, was not only humble in victory, but also acknowledged the role of every team member.

 The typically emotional and speculative Indian media have already started writing off Sourav Ganguly from this Indian ODI squad. While the century that Ganguly scored in the recent Duleep Trophy match against North Zone may not signal his return to form at the international level, he can certainly be brought back to the Indian side to replace the out-of-form Virendra Sehwag in the opening slot to partner Tendulkar. Sehwag may come lower down the order. After all, the Tendulkar-Ganguly opening pair is well-tested and could once again provide the great starts that it has in the past. If Ganguly fails, that may be the end of the road for him. He has shown the determination to perform under pressure in Zimbabwe and in the Duleep Trophy, and hopefully he will perform well under pressure again. Ganguly, like Tendulkar earlier, should forget about the captaincy now. He should concentrate on his batting and aim for some batting records as Tendulkar has done. Only then can he regain his rightful place in the team and leave his mark on the game. He has the talent to do so.

 Yours faithfully,

R.B. Easwaran, Chennai

 Sir ? India?s emphatic win over Sri Lanka in Nagpur shows that the team has come together as a cohesive unit, in spite of the controversies that have beset Indian cricket. It was heartening to see Sachin Tendulkar at his belligerent best after a long time. Credit goes to him also for proposing that Irfan Pathan come in to bat at number three. Pathan has been showing his prowess with the bat ever since his entry into international cricket and India should be able to develop him as a useful all-rounder, as Pakistan has done with Abdul Razzaq and Shoaib Malik. With J.P. Yadav, M.S. Dhoni and Murali Karthik also showing the potential to excel in more than one role in the future, India can take the cricketing world by storm. Also with Rahul Dravid, among the world?s best batsmen today, at the helm, the return of Mohammad Kaif and Sourav Ganguly can only take India from strength to strength. But the team also needs to be consistent.

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Sir ? One should not be carried away by the win in Nagpur. One swallow does not make a summer.

 It remains to be seen whether India can play consistently well to win the series against the Sri Lankans who are a good side and cannot be written off easily. But a good performance in this tour will raise the morale of the team and also send out the message that while India may have been down for a while, it definitely cannot be declared ?out?.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Balakrishanan, Jamshedpur

 Flow chart

 Sir ? As per the report, ?700 target in tap-snap drive rerun? (Metro, Sept 25), Gyan Bharati is one of the prominent defaulters in payment of water tax. But the report appears to have been published without attempting to verify the facts from the school authorities. 

 For quite some time, Calcutta Municipal Corporation authorities have been raising water tax from Gyan Bharati at commercial rates. As per the CMC Act, water tax for an educational building is to be charged at the domestic or residential rate, and not the commercial rate. This fact was brought to the notice of the CMC with the request to bill the school at the domestic rate. In 1999, the judge, Basudev Panigrahi, of the Calcutta high court passed an order to that effect. The CMC has never challenged the order, but in total disregard of it, the CMC continues to raise water tax at the ICI or commercial rate. Gyan Bharati has challenged the bills through a writ petition in the high court. The matter is still sub-judice. But, the court has passed an interim order restraining the CMC from disconnecting the water supply of Gyan Bharati. This interim order continues to be in force. The CMC is also raising bills for three ferrules whereas there are only two ferrules. Moreover an ad hoc payment of Rs 2 lakh has been paid to the CMC as per the court order.

 Yours faithfully,

J.M. Bagla, honorary general secretary, Gyan Bharati, Calcutta

 Deepankar Ganguly replies:

 We stand by our report. Gyan Bharati is included in the CMC?s list of 731 defaulters of ICI connections, each with dues of Rs 5,000 and above. According to CMC records, Gyan Bharati has three ferule connections (two 25 mm and one 10 mm) on its premises. There is no provision in the CMC Act 1980 for education institutions to get water at domestic rates. Admittedly, it has deposited Rs 2 lakh with the CMC as water charges on the directions of the court and there is an order at the moment, restraining the CMC from disconnecting water supply to Gyan Bharati. The total water charges due from the school, as on date, after deducting Rs 2 lakh, stand at Rs 389, 752.

 Letters to Editor

 In black and white

 Sir ? A black Taj Mahal may well be the fulfilment of Shah Jahan?s dreams (?Taj in black, all of 12ft?, Sept 22). But the Mughal emperor would not have been too happy to see the condition of his beloved monument today ? begrimed, its pearly sheen dulled by the fumes emitted by the numerous factories in the vicinity. Thus, while the replica of the Taj in black sand may have been meant in honour of Shah Jahan, ironically, it is also the epitome of his shattered dream.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sharmistha Dhar, Calcutta

 Fare play

 Sir ? The West Bengal government has decided upon the hike in taxi fares without first working out the impact of the rise in fuel prices (?Transport fare hike?, Sept 23). The per kilometre cost of running a taxi has gone up by about 50 paise only as a result of the rise in diesel prices in the last six months, but the fare hike agreed upon is Rs 1.50 per km. Effectively, the metered taxi fare will now be about Rs 10 per km, which is much more than what private taxi operators charge ? between Rs 6-6.50 per km. If the latter can offer such rates and make profits, what is the justification for a higher rate for metered taxis? 

 Such a steep increase in fares will only benefit transport operators who already make considerable profits ? if the manifold increase in the number of buses, minibuses and taxis in past few years is any indication.

 Yours faithfully,

Raj Bagri, Calcutta

 Sir ? In the past few years, bus and taxi fares have been hiked every time oil prices have increased. Invariably, the hike in the fares has been proportionally higher than the increase in oil prices. Clearly, the transporters, who have their unions, can protect their interests. It is the public, which is not unionized, who ultimately suffers. In the coming days, the international price of crude may go up to $100 a barrel if the situation in Iraq does not improve. We must be ready for more such hikes then. 

 Yours faithfully,

Dilip Majumder, Calcutta

 Sir ? Now that fares have been hiked, will bus operators exert themselves to ensure that passengers have a comfortable journey, that their vehicles are road worthy, that overcrowding is not permitted? The transport sector needs a regulatory authority to decide a reasonable fare, respond to passengers? grievances and ensure the growth of the industry. 

 Yours faithfully,

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? It?s very easy for Subhas Chakraborty, who goes everywhere in government vehicles, to say that ?People should walk for 2 kms on days of strike? (Sept 21). What about patients? What about students who will have to miss their schools and tuitions? What about those who will get stranded in railway stations and airports? The minister must learn to think beyond and not justify the call of the transport unions. On the one hand, we find our ?do it now? chief minister going from country to country, wooing investors and at the same time, we find his own partymen justifying issues which are against the common man. What an irony!

 Yours faithfully,

Sumant Poddar, Calcutta 

 Sir ? How many of us know that India has had a law since pre-independence that makes riding a bicycle at night without a light an offence? Not knowing this, I was cycling home on September 20, the day of the transport strike. The policeman who caught me in front of Tollygunge police station, wouldn?t let me go unless I paid Rs 95 as fine, without a receipt I might add. 

 Yours faithfully,

Debashis Prusty, Calcutta

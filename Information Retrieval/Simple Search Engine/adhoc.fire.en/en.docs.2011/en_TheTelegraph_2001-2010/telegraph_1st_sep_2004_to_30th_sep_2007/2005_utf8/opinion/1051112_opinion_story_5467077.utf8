 HES

 GOT THE

 DRIVE

 Like a few others in this league of extraordinary gentlemen playing the gentlemans game, Gautam Gambhir has promised himself a seat on the plane to West Indies in 2007 

 By all accounts, Gautam Gambhir is an honourable man. And all assorted nitpickers ? friends, Indians, countrymen ? dare not contest that. Its evident in every move he makes. His stance ? on the pitch and off it ? is confident, his behaviour at after-match press conferences is as impeccable as his drives through cover. 

 After a long time in the wilderness, he returned to the Indian one-day team to score a scintillating century in the fifth match versus Sri Lanka last Sunday. India lost the match, but the selectors faith in the southpaw was strengthened. Gambhirs honour was left intact. 

 But then, as some see it, so are they all, all honourable men in this new-look Indian team. A glance through the score cards of the India-Sri Lanka series so far would show you that.

 If Gambhir did it on Sunday, it was Rudra Pratap Singh at Rajkot on Wednesday. Every time the Men in Blue have floundered, a fresh face has moved up to step on the gas. And once the job is done and the Man of the Match award received, they quietly move back to their place in the line-up. Thats the ethic Chappells boys swear by ? and Gautam Gambhir is just one of the cogs in the Indian crickets wheel of fortune. 

 Obviously, Gambhir is modest enough to play down his contribution. Oh yes, Im happy. After all, it was my first one-day century. But it would have felt better had the team won, he says, sounding tired after the evening flight that took the team to Vadodara straight after the Rajkot match. But how does it feel now that he has proved himself in the shorter version of the game? I got the news of my selection for the Sri Lanka series on my birthday [October 14]. Its the best birthday gift I couldve possibly got, he reveals. 

 Gambhir knows how important his selection is at this juncture. He is not a veteran, but at 24 hes no spring chicken either. The one-day call-up has come almost after two-and-a-half years. Though he made his debut under Sourav Ganguly back in 2003, its only now ? with his place cemented in the Test side since early-2005 ? that he has come into his own. And at a time when a clutch of youngsters is forever snapping at the heels of the seniors, Gambhir has his task cut out. 

 Hes not the sort to shy away from challenges, the competition will only egg him on, says Sunil Khanna, chief selector of the Delhi Ranji team. Sharma should know ? after all, he was the one to bring Gambhir into the ONGC fold in 2002 just when the youngster was making an impression all around. 

 The phenomenal rise of Gambhir began after he joined ONGC. I remember, he had returned late at night from an India A match, but the next morning he was there for practice at 7 am sharp. Thats how dedicated he is, and thats what will stand him in good stead, Khanna says. 

 But then dedication has always been Gambhirs middle name ? ever since he started out at the nets at the age of 12. No one at Gambhirs Karol Bagh residence ? least of all his businessman father ? had had any truck with cricket before Gambhir padded up for Chand Khanna Cricket Club, a first division outfit in Delhi. 

 The only exception was uncle Pawan Gulati, who was a major inspiration in his early days. Ever since he started training under me, I have noticed he has wonderful hand-eye coordination and excellent eyesight ? both advantages in one-day matches, says Raju Tandon, Gambhirs coach since1996. 

 Gambhir feels it was the hard work he put in while at Modern School, Barakhamba Road, New Delhi, that is paying off now. I was there at the nets in the mornings and again in the afternoons. Somehow I managed to balance practice with academics, says the man with 18 hundreds in domestic cricket. He was snapped up by ONGC while he was still doing his graduation at Hindu College, along with other India hopefuls like Munaf Patel and Amit Mishra. By the time he replaced Akash Chopra ? another Delhi team mate ? in the India Test squad in early 2005, life on the 22 yards had come full circle for the opener. 

 Hes a very good student of the game, and that makes him stand out. He was suspect to rising deliveries earlier, but thats something he has sorted out now. Every time he gets out, he asks the coach and seniors for their opinion on what they think went wrong, says former national selector Sambaran Banerjee. 

 But for the man who idolises Sourav Ganguly and loves Rani Mukherjees films, this is just the beginning. Like others in this league of extraordinary gentlemen, Gambhir has promised himself a seat on the plane to West Indies in 2007. And that, Gambhir would have you believe, is an honourable promise.

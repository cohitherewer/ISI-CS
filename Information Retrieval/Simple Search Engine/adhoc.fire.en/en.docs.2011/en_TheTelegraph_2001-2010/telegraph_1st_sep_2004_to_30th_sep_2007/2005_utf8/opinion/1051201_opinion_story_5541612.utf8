 SPARRING PARTNER

 It was an irresponsible coalition ally that made matters worse for the RJD. Will it be the same for Nitish Kumar? asks Sumanta Sen

 Saying it with roses, for now

 During the Rashtriya Janata Dal regime in Bihar, the house which was perhaps the most photographed was the one on Anne Marg in Patna. That was the official residence first of Lalu Prasad and then Rabri Devi. When the results came out, it was known that the house would now have to be vacated. But nobody could have anticipated the speed with which the government department concerned acted. The notice to vacate reached Rabri Devi even as Nitish Kumar was being sworn in. Never before had Patna witnessed such a ?do it now? attitude on the part of babudom.

 Nitish Kumar protagonists may claim that this is indicative of the new mood that has set in at the secretariat. Actually, it appears more as an act of revenge, perhaps the first of many to follow. It may well be that the chief minister himself had no knowledge of the notice being sent, but then somebody had overstepped to please him. Not quite the right atmosphere to start an innings, particularly when Nitish Kumar had categorically stated that he would not be vengeful against anybody.

 In the case of the size of the ministry, too, Nitish Kumar had announced that at first about a dozen would take oath. The number shot up to 25. Either he had not stated the truth or he had been overtaken by more powerful elements. Will this be a pattern for the days to come?

 Nitish Kumar has announced that he would not look for scandals. With so much on his hands, he cannot be expected to have the time to sniff around. But can the same be said of his coalition partner? The Bharatiya Janata Party knows that even with a deputy chief minister, it will be forced to remain in the background. Unless, of course, it can unearth scams and hit the headlines. And if that happens, it will mean bidding a goodbye to governance.

 Talking of scams, one man who should feel a bit assured is former Congress chief minister, Jagannath Mishra. One of the accused in the fodder case, he now has the satisfaction of seeing his son in the ministry. That should be of some comfort.

 Coming back to the ministry. It is too early to predict how it will function, but it is clear that Nitish Kumar was guided by political compulsions to a large degree. Most of those from the Janata Dal (United) belong to the backward communities as do five of the eight from the BJP. This was natural in a state like Bihar, but the forward castes, who were expecting a total rehabilitation, cannot be too happy and Sushil Modi has already heard some chin music. This caste issue will remain alive as it always has been in Bihar, no matter how much the chief minister may claim that he is above such considerations. To what extent he will be able to keep away the ?history sheeters? will also matter. There are still 11 ministers to be taken in and heads of various corporations.

 Political compulsions also led to the inclusion of Ramashray Prasad Singh, former Congressman who joined Ram Vilas Paswan and then defected to the Janata Dal(U) after the February polls. He lost this time, but Nitish Kumar, obviously, had no other option but to take him in. It was amusing to find in the ministry a number of those who had earlier served under Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi and were thus party to their ?misrule?. To what extent will such people contribute to the public vision of a clean ministry?

 And therein lies the problem. A chief minister, no matter how well intentioned and honest, can always be hamstrung by those around him and a culture developed over the past many years. A word commonly heard in Bihar is pairvi or favour which the upper classes consider their birth right. Don?t grant favours and you make enemies who can make things difficult for you. The lower classes do not matter. There is also the need to shuffle bureaucrats around, and that also will require a great deal of social engineering, perhaps even at the cost of efficiency.

 Meanwhile, what about the opposition? The news is that Sonia Gandhi is seeking to bring Prasad and Paswan together. This won?t be easy right now. Besides, why didn?t she try this before the February election? Instead, she had helped the differences grow by hitching onto the Paswan bandwagon because he had agreed to her party?s totally unreasonable demand for seats. In November, she ditched Paswan, making little serious effort to bring the two together. A few days before the last round of voting, she was heard saying that she did not share Prasad?s optimism. She was being practical but she said the words without any show of concern. It was as if she were a spectator at a wrestling match in which she had a favourite but wasn?t too sure of him. Not quite the right attitude for a coalition partner or a leader at the national level.

 This is often the problem with coalition partners, they feel they have no responsibility. It is the way with smaller parties in West Bengal and the Congress in Bihar. As the results were being announced, the common refrain was that people wanted change. Implied was a criticism of Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi. Yet from 2000-05, the Congress was a partner of the RJD. Why did it not caution the duo? Even after the UPA came to power and fissures appeared between the two Bihar ministers, the UPA chairperson was not seen doing anything about it, though she must have known that the assembly election was just a year away. Nor, apparently, did she take stock of her party?s position in the state, seeking instead to needle Mulayam Singh Yadav in Lucknow.

 Whatever efforts Sonia Gandhi may be making now would also be frustrated by her own party in the state. In Patna, the Congress has always been suspicious of Prasad, and the fact that the latter?s vote share has not suffered may make the party uneasy?in their moment of rout they would also have liked to see him pulled down. Also, individual Congressmen may well choose other umbrellas as they did in Uttar Pradesh.

 In a coalition, smaller constituents have to chip in at poll times, as they do in West Bengal. Lalu Prasad does not enjoy that kind of support and knows that he will have to be on his own. If he makes up with Paswan it will be because he feels the urge to do so, not because of Sonia Gandhi.

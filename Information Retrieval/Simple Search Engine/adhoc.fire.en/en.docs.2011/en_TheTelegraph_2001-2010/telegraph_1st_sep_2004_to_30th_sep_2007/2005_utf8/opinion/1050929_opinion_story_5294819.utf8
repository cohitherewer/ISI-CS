 MINOR TROUBLE

 There are enough reasons to suspect that the Cooch Behar agitation will not snowball into a major conflagration, argues Sumanta Sen

 The pitfalls

 No matter how tragic the recent incident in Cooch Behar, it should not unduly disturb people. Mob frenzy, leading to the death of policemen, is nothing new. And such incidents do not create any violence of unmanageable proportions. Cooch Behar is unlikely to be an exception. Not that elements demanding a separate Greater Cooch Behar or a Kamtapur will not remain on the scene or will not create trouble every now and then. But they will never be able to upset the existing scheme of things or even to snatch some concessions, and there are strong reasons for this.

 The movements in Cooch Behar or Jalpaiguri are ethnic in nature and as such are similar to the agitations by the Ulfa, Bodo separatists or the GNLF. But the similarity ends there. Unlike the movements in Assam or Darjeeling, the ones for Kamtapur or a separate Cooch Behar are much older. Yet in the last three decades or more, they have not been able to gather the kind of momentum witnessed in Assam or the hills of West Bengal. For instance, in Cooch Behar the agitationists numbered around 30,000, negligible in a district with a 2 million population. And that figure can safely be assumed to represent the total support base of the agitation. Similarly, the Kamtapuris, be it the Kamtapur Peoples Party or the Kamtapur Liberation Organization, have never been able to display much mass support.

 There are reasons for this. The Rajbansis or the adivasis in whose interest the agitations were supposedly launched have never been en bloc with these. Indeed the CPI(M), Forward Bloc, Revolutionary Socialist Party, all enjoy considerable influence among these ethnic groups. In Cooch Behar, the undivided CPI had been in the forefront against feudal rule and today it would be silly to argue that the Rajbansis had been, and remain, against the former native state?s integration with the Indian Union and West Bengal. The same can be said about the move for a separate Kamtapur. The creation of any such region today would mean the inclusion of parts of Assam, and even in far-flung Jalpaiguri people are not so gullible as to believe that this would be possible.

 The situation in West Bengal is thus far removed from that in Assam. The issue of identity, the guiding force behind such agitations, is far stronger in that state. Hence the overwhelming support for the AASU agitation in the Seventies, the muted support for the Ulfa or the Bodo movement. It must also be taken into consideration that political forces opposed to separatism do not enjoy a mass base in Assam and so a contrary political view has never existed.

 Then there is the demographic pattern. The Assam agitators have always been able to rope in popular support by targeting the minority Bengalis as the root of all problems. In Jalpaiguri and Cooch Behar, the ethnic groups cannot do the same with the Bengalis whose numbers have gone up over the years, thanks to migration from across the borders. Also, there is no evidence that the ordinary Rajbansi or adivasi has ever felt any problem with the migrants or other Bengalis. And historically both communities have actively participated in political struggles which always ensures a deep bond.

 The Kamtapuris or those demanding a Greater Cooch Behar are unaware of this ground-level reality. Hence the efforts to create panic through armed action. The Union home ministry official was perhaps right when he said that judging from the nature of attacks on policemen, it seemed the agitationists had come prepared to create mayhem. It is also quite possible that they receive help, both arms and money, from the Ulfa and Maoists of Nepal who seek temporary shelter in contiguous areas of north Bengal. But it would perhaps be too much to assume that such links would lead to north Bengal becoming another Assam. Also, the Kamtapuris are in considerable disarray at the moment and the Cooch Behar separatists too may go their way, unless of course they are egged on by diverse forces for their own narrow interests. Till the elections next year, there may be other incidents but the sustaining force cannot be seen right now. In the days before the 2001 assembly elections, the Kamtapuris had become so active that opposition parties had considered an electoral understanding with the KPP. But what happened after the polls? It must also be kept in mind that the Ulfa is now seeking talks with the Centre, which suggests that it may lie low for the time being.

 The fact that the activists could mobilize 30,000 or more people is being over-emphasized. There is a lot of grievance around and mobilizing a large number for a particular programme is not that difficult. But what happens when that programme ends? The Telegraph reported a woman among the agitators saying that they had been told that a separate state would mean more money for them. They had obviously been carried away by this dream of a Utopia. But will the dream remain when the reality is explained to them, as it must be by those seeking to politically isolate the agitation leaders? If the Kamtapur experience is an indicator then such dreams die soon.

 Movements of such nature invariably lead to speculation about ?foreign hands? being involved. The allegation, though not always baseless, seems inappropriate in the present context. Neither agitation holds out the promise of creating large and permanent areas of disturbance. So why should any force of destabilization be interested? 

 And this is where the intelligence agencies should come into play. If the query about the source of the money is diligently pursued, it might lead to answers which would be helpful in the future. Whether the authorities, both in Calcutta and New Delhi, are interested in such knowledge is, of course, another matter. Right now the chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, seems keenly interested in the subject of terror and he may order the search operations to be extended to cover this area also. That should also please Kamal Guha, his cabinet colleague from Dinhata, the same district under consideration.

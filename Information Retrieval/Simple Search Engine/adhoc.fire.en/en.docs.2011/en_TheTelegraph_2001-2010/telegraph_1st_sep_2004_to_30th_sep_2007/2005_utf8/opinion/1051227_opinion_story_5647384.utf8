 VESTED SENSE

 Partisan politics has long been the bane of economic development in India. Jharkhand?s opposition parties proved this once again when they boycotted a meeting that the chief minister had called to discuss issues relating to new investments in the state. It is one thing to have different approaches to development issues and quite another to take an obstructionist position. The new investments should be a matter of great expectations for the economically backward state. At the same time, the displacement of people because of the new industries and plans for their rehabilitation should be a matter of concern for both the government and the opposition parties. But, boycotting the chief minister?s meeting is not the best way of persuading the government to change its ways. It is not difficult, though, to see why these parties acted in the manner they did. They obviously want to use the issues of displacement and rehabilitation as major political campaigns. As new industries start coming up in Jharkhand, these may well be the most sensitive political issues. The trouble is that politicians are known to trample on economic logic in order to score small political points. It would be a pity if bad politics spoils the state?s economic promise. 

 However, the chief minister, Mr Arjun Munda, has to take part of the blame for the opposition?s move. He clearly needs to show more credible evidence of his sincerity about discussing the issues with these parties. He should have used the session of the state assembly for debating them. Instead, he called the all-party meeting only after the session had ended. A debate in the assembly would have given an opportunity to all parties to express their views on the issues. Such a debate would have made the government?s position clear not only to the opposition but also to the people. Mr Munda has succeeded in wooing large investments to the state, thanks mainly to its natural resources. But his government has to be seen to be transparent in its policy about new investments. Transparency and a political consensus will be needed more for the government?s policy on the rehabilitation of people who would be displaced from their homes. Mr Munda?s ways with the opposition parties did little to inspire their confidence. Neither the chief minister nor his opponents would do the state any good if they reduce the development issues to a party squabble.

 FACTS AND FEARS

 Gathering data is an important part of some experiments. Hence, from the present look of things, the ?Gujarat experiment? is still, in a sense, going on. Quietly and systematically, a new ?survey? is being carried out in the village schools. And all the sinister euphemisms are in place. This time, the Gujarat government has suddenly sat up to the fact that schoolchildren in the state?s 18,000 villages have to be made socially and culturally aware. So district education officials are going around all the schools making the children fill in a questionnaire, most of which concerns the student?s religious background, with a few token questions on educational matters. Writing out the answers to these questions is also supposed to improve the students? writing skills. The survey is being supervised by the minister of education, who claims that this is a secular gathering of information. She has also invoked child rights ? children have a right to know the religion of the people they live with.

 This has happened before, several times, in Gujarat, and it is important to remember when and how. The burning of churches and violence against tribal Christians in the Dangs district was followed by a survey of Christians in 1999. That time the police were virtually acting as census officers, and this was repeated at least three more times, most importantly during the run-up to the passing of the anti-conversion bill in the state assembly. In all these instances, the police had gone around trying to enumerate Christian families, asking converts why and when they converted, and the sources of income of Christian institutions undertaking welfare schemes in the villages. Christian bodies had moved the courts in each case, and the high court had forbidden these surveys. The police would keep off for a while, and then it would begin again ? more or less covertly, but still managing to intimidate the minority communities. From the police to education officials, the role of the administration and the bureaucracy ought to be subjected to the highest vigilance in Gujarat. This is one of the most crucial lessons of the 2002 genocide. To regard such ?gathering of information? as politicized paranoia would be foolish after the disclosure of how systematic the preparations for the ?riots? were in 2002. There is much that would remain unknown about Godhra and its aftermath, but also much that has been revealed about how it had all come about.

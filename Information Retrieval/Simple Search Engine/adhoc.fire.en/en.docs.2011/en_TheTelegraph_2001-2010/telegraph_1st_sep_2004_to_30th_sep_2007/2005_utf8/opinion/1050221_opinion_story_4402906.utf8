 NEW CALL

 The support of the British foreign secretary, Mr Jack Straw, for Indian membership of an expanded United Nations security council is an obvious recognition of New Delhi?s growing importance in the international system. But the foreign secretary?s categorical assertion that the membership would come without veto powers is disappointing. Mr Straw?s statement comes after the UN panel?s report, which was mandated to look into the question of an increase of membership of the security council, favoured a similar expansion although it provided other options as well. Moreover, there are implicit indications by other permanent members that they too believed that the right to veto should be restricted to the five countries that already have that entitlement. Mr Straw favours an expansion of the security council in order to include Germany, Japan, Brazil and India as permanent members. But he made it clear that the United Kingdom supported ?option A?, from the choices provided by the UN panel, which provided for new membership without veto powers. 

 Mr Straw claimed that if nine new members were given veto powers, it could put the security council in a difficult position. On the face of it, there may seem to be some merit in the British foreign secretary?s reasoning. The UN security council has the paramount responsibility for the maintenance of peace and security based on the principle of collective security. During the Cold War, the UN was rendered ineffective because of the frequent use of the veto by the United States of America or the former Soviet Union. In the post-Cold War era, there has been less confrontation among the permanent members which has enabled the UN to mount humanitarian interventions in various parts of the globe. 

 But, as the recent US-led intervention in Iraq revealed, it was difficult to arrive at a consensus even amongst those who were firmly tied together during the Cold War. Additional veto-wielding powers may, on the face of it, create more confusion. However, there is a larger point that Mr Straw seems to have missed. The UN collective security system is based on a concert of great powers who take responsibility for the stability of the international system. If such a system has to be effective, it must reflect contemporary realities. In other words, the need is to give veto powers to those who wield power today and not to those who were victorious in World War II. By this logic, therefore, Britain and France have less right to a veto than Japan or India. This calls for a radical reform of the UN system, but that is the only way to make the organization truly effective.

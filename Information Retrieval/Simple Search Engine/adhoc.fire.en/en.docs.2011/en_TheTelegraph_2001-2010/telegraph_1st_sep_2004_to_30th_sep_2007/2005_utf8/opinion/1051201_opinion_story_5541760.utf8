 RUN OUT

 The art of relinquishing power demands a grace which is not associated with the process of wielding power. Mr Jagmohan Dalmiya had a very long innings at the helm of affairs in the Board of Control for Cricket in India and did not leave till he was forced to do so. Throughout his tenure, he remained in complete control, and this control ranged from administrative and financial matters to the selection of the Indian team. He was also ruthless in the way he used his power, and he manipulated situations to his own advantage. He brought power politics into the BCCI, and not surprisingly, he was outmanoeuvred by Mr Sharad Pawar, a skilled practitioner of vote garnering and backroom politicking. Mr Dalmiya was hoisted by his own petard. Mr Dalmiya knew no loyalties except the perpetuation of his own power and politics. He could be on the swings with the Bharatiya Janata Party when it was in power, and then be on the roundabout with the Congress when it held office. Such a person commands no respect and this led to Mr Dalmiya?s somewhat ignominious downfall. His long tenure suggests that regulations in the BCCI and in other similar associations need to be modified so that no individual can remain in office after he has held the position of president.

 Mr Dalmiya?s remarkable achievement during his long stint was the manner in which he secured votes from the various state associations. He, however, did not use his power to bring about major changes in Indian cricket. In fact, he used his position to stonewall radical changes. This was most appallingly manifest during the scandal regarding players accused of betting and match fixing. He was also not initially very keen to appoint a professional coach. Mr Dalmiya enriched the BCCI but not in cricketing terms. Mr Pawar?s arrival may not alter this situation. Like Mr Dalmiya, Mr Pawar has no real stakes in cricket. The BCCI presidentship is only an extension of his ego. The future of the BCCI will perhaps be best served if it is corporatized and a professional manager brought in to manage it. The cricketing aspects, including selection, can be looked after by a professional coach. The president and other office bearers could function as a board of directors and provide overall guidance. The change of guard in no way presages a radical shift within the BCCI. Genuine professionalization is still not on the agenda of the BCCI.

 Letters to Editor

 Bag full of good intent

 Sir ? The Supreme Court?s effort to reinforce the Dowry Prohibition Act by introducing 13 new directives is more than welcome. But considering the tendency of our society towards defilement and underhandedness ? here people regularly forge documents of their academic and professional credentials ? even one loophole will prevent the law from delivering the goods. It is difficult to imagine that our government employees will sit down with pen and paper and draw up lists of dowry items. And as for the rule of depositing gifts in the wife?s name, who will see whether this is done? Marriage in India being a social union more than anything else, it is unlikely that wives will expose their lying husbands. If the dowry system has become a menace, then the way our society functions is responsible for it. No amount of good intention can help, unless the practical details are worked out.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sharmistha Dhar, Calcutta

 Judgment day

 Sir ? The conviction of Aftab Ansari and six of his aides in the American Center attack of January 22, 2002 is entirely expected (?Death sentence, for all seven?, April 28). But the ?dignified coldness? of the principal convict, Ansari, is quite frightening. The fear and remorse of the sentenced convict is supposed to put fear into the hearts of people and thus deter them from criminal acts. It must have been quite impossible to feel frightened looking at the smiling face of Ansari, though awarded the death sentence only minutes ago. Is the real purpose behind the ultimate punishment being served? 

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Sir ? The last one had been for a rapist, this one for a group of hard-core terrorists for ?waging war against the nation?. This is the second death sentence to come out of Calcutta in less than a year. For some, like the widow of a security guard killed in the American Center attack, this is justice. There are others who favour the abolition of the death sentence. What is important here is that people are able to form their own opinion on the issue. In this, the media have a huge role to play. One hopes, therefore, that the media does not turn this into another Dhananjoy story, if the death sentences are finally upheld by the highest court. 

 The first signs of a hardened criminal being turned into a celebrity is already beginning to show. Why must the morning newspaper describe in such philosophical and picturesque manner, the attire of the convict, the defiance in his voice and gait, and use dramatic language to establish the tragic mood? It is all very well to want to present the news in its entire character, but in doing so, the media should refrain from creating an atmosphere that evokes sympathy for the dregs of society. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sarit Ray, Calcutta

 Sir ? Basudeb Majumdar?s ruling should be a clear signal to the elements who are bent upon fomenting terror in India. Aftab Ansari, the mastermind of the attack, was also involved indirectly in the 9/11 attack as he siphoned off the ransom he had received from the kidnap of a Calcutta businessman. While justice has been done in this case, in another instance of terrorism, the Kanishka bombing accused managed to get away scot-free through the loopholes in Canadian law.

 Yours faithfully,

R. Sekar, Angul, Orissa

 Sir ? It may appear that justice has eventually prevailed, with the sessions court judge pronouncing the death sentence on Aftab Ansari and six others. But a closer look may reveal a different picture. It took several years for the trial court to announce the judgment. Under Indian law, the convicted persons may appeal to higher courts and ultimately to the Supreme Court. No one need be in any doubt that Ansari and his buddies will follow this legal course. And the process will be dragged for years, even decades, given the pace of Indian courts. And of course, there is the possibility that the sessions court ruling may be overturned by one or more of the higher legal forums. Little wonder then that Aftab appeared defiant even while staring at a death sentence. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kunal Saha, Columbus, US

 What a debut!

 Sir ? For some time now, I have been suffering the poor quality of journalism in The Telegraph. Quite often, the grammar is incorrect, syntax poor and plurals are used where they are not required. We wince, but hold our peace. But ?Tintin on centre stage, mischief backstage? (April 25), on the fifth day of the Lakme India Fashion Week, was a bit too much. Could someone please tell the reporter (who wrote about ?a dazzling debut by a veteran duo?) that a veteran cannot make a debut, dazzling or otherwise? A debut is, and always will be, the first appearance or public exhibition, and my English dictionary tells me that a veteran is one who has worked in a particular discipline for many many years (such as war veteran or veteran thespian...if you want to use big words). Young writers who are making their debut in journalism need editing and review by the veterans in the organization.

 Yours faithfully,

Iti Misra, Calcutta

 PLACE OF PEACE

 It takes hard work to make peace. Hurdles on the way may be unavoidable, but the important thing is not to let them overtake the larger mission. The peace talks between the Naga rebels and New Delhi have survived several twists and turns. There have been encounters between the two sides and other violations of the ceasefire agreement. But the killing of five Naga rebels in Shillong raises serious questions that both sides must try to answer sincerely. The incident may cast its shadow on another round of peace talks in Bangkok. The two sides could, however, use the opportunity to look deeper at the causes of such flare-ups. That can happen only if both sides come clean on their conduct. Mr Thuingaleng Muivah of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim may justifiably question if the killing was not a case of violation of human rights. There clearly is a case for an impartial investigation into the NSCN?s allegation that the rebels were tortured before being killed. If that were true, then the rebels could not have been shot during an ?encounter?, as the Meghalaya police claimed. But, Mr Muivah too has to explain why the rebels were carrying arms or why they sought to escape, as the police said, while challenged. 

 The real problem seems to lie in the ceasefire agreement itself. It applies only to Nagaland, thereby leaving the two sides free to take different positions in other places. The Meghalaya government was thus technically right in claiming that the ceasefire was not applicable in that state. But then, the larger aim of peace cannot be sacrificed over technical points. True, the extension of the truce to other states in the region, as the NSCN wants, is no simple matter. It has long remained a highly sensitive issue outside Nagaland. An attempt to extend the truce to Manipur some years ago ignited a violent protest there. The Manipuris saw it as a threat to the territorial integrity of their state. On the other hand, the current jurisdiction of the truce keeps the hostilities alive outside Nagaland. A way out of this tangle may not be too difficult to find if the two sides agree on a code of conduct for areas other than Nagaland. But no code or unwritten arrangements will work if the rebels use the peace talks as a cover for other battles. The two sides have substantive issues to resolve; stray skirmishes and blame games will unnecessarily delay the peace process.

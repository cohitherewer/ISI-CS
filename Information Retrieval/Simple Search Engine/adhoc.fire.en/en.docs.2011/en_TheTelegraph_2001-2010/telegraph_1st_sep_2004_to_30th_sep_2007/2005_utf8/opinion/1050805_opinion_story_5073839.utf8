 JUST SENSE

 Twenty-four years is a long time in a mother?s life. That is how long Ms Anwara Bibi has waited, running from court to court and back again, in the hope that justice will be meted out to the killers of her four sons. This is not unusual. One of the cases, among hundreds, that has impelled the Supreme Court to make a decisive statement about fixed schedules for resolving cases is that of Mr Ajoy Ghosh. Mr Ghosh has been in jail for 36 years; had he been convicted, the maximum sentence for his offence would have been two years. This situation is not the result of a few days? mismanagement. The mismanagement has increased as the incredible pressure on the judicial system has grown over the years. In December 2004, 50 lakh cases were awaiting disposal. The system is unable to cope. Delays in appointments, overcrowded schedules and the lack of infrastructural expansion ? the fast-track courts are already a vanishing phenomenon ? make progress impossible. This atmosphere nurtures self-interested indifference, it encourages the lawyer and the policeman to sleep on the job.

 But it is the attitude of the government that is the most casual. Indian legislators love making laws, without a thought as to how they are to be implemented. The Supreme Court has stated clearly that there must be a judicial impact assessment every time a new legislation is enacted. The overburdened and now immensely complicated judicial system is left to fend for itself with almost the same number of courthouses, the same finances, and an inadequate number of officials. There is, in the first place, no need for so many laws. Besides, there is very little support for even the sensible provisions. If, for example, mediation and arbitration are now legal options to lessen the flow of cases, there must be infrastructure, funds and people to implement them. The court has not stopped there. It has laid down a multi-track schedule for criminal and civil cases, with a time limit for the resolution of their different types, the category depending upon the seriousness of the offence. It has also asked that government agencies, which refuse to respond in time to court orders, should be penalized. The Supreme Court is doing the actual job of analysing the wrongs in the system and proposing solutions. It is now upto the government to respond, as it is upto the lawyers to help, rather than hinder, the reforms.

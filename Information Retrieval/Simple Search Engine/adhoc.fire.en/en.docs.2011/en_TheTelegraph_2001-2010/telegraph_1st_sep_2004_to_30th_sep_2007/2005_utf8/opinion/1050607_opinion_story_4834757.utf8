 RIGHT UP THERE 

 A struggle almost 35 years old has borne some fruit at last. Two women have been appointed to the municipal council of Kuwait a month after women were granted the right to vote. Since 1971, women in Kuwait have been engaged in a struggle to amend the law so that they could participate in politics. It is a mark of the vision and courage of Kuwaiti women that active participation in politics was their goal even when their country refused them the vote. Yet the appointment of the women councillors ? two among the six who are appointed while the others are elected ? has nothing directly to do with the decision regarding women?s suffrage on May 16. That decision came too late for women to vote in the municipal elections; they will have to wait for 2007 to exercise their franchise for the first time.

 The case of Kuwait exposes certain contradictions that dog all campaigns for rights. The interplay of forces, the balance of powers within and outside the movement, the tensions that culminate in a partially positive result, must all be fully understood for campaigns of the future. It must be noted that Kuwait?s women were more liberal and better educated than their peers in neighbouring countries, yet it took 35 years for them to obtain a political right that is not so uncommon beyond their borders. Although the majority of parliamentarians and the prime minister have been lauded for their unflinching support of the women?s cause, it cannot be forgotten either that women actually did not have the right to vote till last month. Yet Kuwait?s constitution stipulates a gender-equal society from the point of view of rights and benefits. Kuwait?s promise to the United States of America, of which it is a strategic partner, to bring about democratic reform has perhaps been the most effective in altering the status of women. Qatar and Bahrain have women in parliament, Lebanon, Egypt and Jordan have women ministers too. The traditional governance structure of Kuwait is hardly amenable to democracy. But women?s position in society may act as a perceptible index of equality and fairness, especially since other Islamic countries have this to show. Rather than opportunistic praise of the women?s campaign, what is necessary is a hard-headed analysis of the contribution of external political pressures to this fruition of the women?s long and determined struggle.

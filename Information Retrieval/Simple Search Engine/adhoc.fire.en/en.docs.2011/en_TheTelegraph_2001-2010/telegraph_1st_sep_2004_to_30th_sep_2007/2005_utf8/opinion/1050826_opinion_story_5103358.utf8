 INTRIGUE IN A TIME OF WAR

 Death in Danzig

 By Stefan Chwin, 

 Secker and Warburg, $ 14

 Death in Danzig is Stefan Chwin?s first novel to be translated into English. The translator, Philip Boehm, succeeds in rendering the bleak feel of the novel?s post-World War II setting. The novel, with its continuous undertone of death and stagnation, grows depressingly on the reader. Chwin?s style is impressionistic, often leaving threads of the story unexplained. The characters are ably sketched, but the backgrounds of some are never discussed to the full advantage of the story. 

 The novel is set in 1945, with the Axis occupation of Poland coming to an end. The Germans are fleeing Danzig, a coastal town in Poland. The Russians are just around the corner. Hahnemann, a German professor at the Anatomy School, is the central character of the novel.

 A woman drowns under mysterious circumstances. Hahnemann is summoned to conduct the autopsy. The bodybag reveals a shock for him, inducing, effectively, a slumber that lasts him through the novel. It is the body of his sweetheart, Loisa Berger. Her death comes only a few days before they were supposed to leave Danzig together for Germany. He leaves the School immediately, never to return again. 

 While everybody from Grottger Street leave for Germany, Hahnemann decides to stay back. With its German residents leaving Danzig, Polish refugees come back to the city. They move into the stately houses once occupied by the Germans on Lessingstrasse, to be renamed Grottger Street in a short while. 

 Piotr, the Polish boy who later takes on the role of the narrator, is still in his mother?s womb. His parents move into the flat below Hahnemann?s. Later appears Hanka, a woman whose nationality and background can only be guessed. She is taken into Piotr?s household as a maid. A deaf and mute little boy, with extraordinary powers of mimicry, is discovered by Hanka, and he too is taken into the household. 

 Hahnemann, we now come to know, is knowledgeable in the art of sign-language. Thus, the task of teaching this new boy, Adam, is assigned to him. Oddly enough, only after Adam is introduced is it disclosed to the readers that Hahnemann is adept at sign-language. The coming together of Hahnemann, Hanka and Adam seems to be arranged as a counterpoint to the general pessimism of the novel. 

 Inanimate objects are described with intense clarity in the novel. The suicides of Kleist and Witkicwicz, literary figures both, are needlessly discussed at length. Authorial presence dominates the latter part of the novel.

 Barring its minor drawbacks, Death in Danzig is profoundly observant, and documents well the social dynamics of post-war Poland.

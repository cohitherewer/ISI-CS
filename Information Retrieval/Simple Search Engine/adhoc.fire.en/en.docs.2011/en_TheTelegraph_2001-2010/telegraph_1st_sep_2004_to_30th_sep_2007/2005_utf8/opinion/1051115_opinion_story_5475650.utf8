 FAILED STATE

 A weak and indecisive state is the worst thing that can happen to its citizens. The Maoist offensive in Bihar?s Jehanabad town symbolizes the appalling failure of the state. Rarely have Maoists or any other rebel groups anywhere in the country launched an attack on the state?s authority on such a scale. And rarely has the state cowered so pathetically before such an offensive. The incident reflects a significant departure from usual Maoist tactics. In Bihar, Jharkhand or Andhra Pradesh, such rebel attacks are usually carried out by small armed squads. The element of surprise is crucial to the traditional guerrilla warfare. In Jehanabad, hundreds of Maoists virtually surprised the authorities, raided the jail and managed to free one of their important leaders. About 240 other inmates also used the Maoist charge in order to escape the prison. The rebels must have taken weeks, if not months, to prepare for the offensive. While all this shows their audacity, the more shocking part of the incident is the administrative failure to gather intelligence on the rebels? moves and to foil them. Since Bihar is under President?s rule, accusing fingers will be pointed towards the governor, Mr Buta Singh. The malaise, though, runs deeper and is a result of years of subversion of the rule of law. 

 A larger failure relates to the state?s policy. Maoist depredations are not new, nor are they confined to Bihar. As many as fifteen states now face the threat in varying degrees. Yet, New Delhi does not seem to have a proper policy to deal with the problem. Emergency measures taken in the wake of major Maoist challenges do not add up to a policy. They are more in the nature of knee-jerk reactions. Add to this the vague debates on social and economic issues that are supposed to trigger such violent movements. There is little doubt that Maoists are strong in areas where social and economic deprivations are the worst. But, it is suicidal to allow these considerations to detract from the state?s responsibility to fight the rebels. After all, a violent political creed remains its own justification. The state, therefore, has to put down the rebellion first at all costs. There should be no conflict between this fight and a strategy to improve the socio-economic conditions of the people in rebel-controlled areas. But, the rule of law and the authority of the state cannot be reduced to a bargain.

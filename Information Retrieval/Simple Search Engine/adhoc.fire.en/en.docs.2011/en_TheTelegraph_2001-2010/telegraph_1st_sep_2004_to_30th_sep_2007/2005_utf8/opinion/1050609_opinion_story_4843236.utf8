 SLOW CHANGE

 Watching the changes within the Communist Party of India (Marxist) is like watching a giant tanker turning on its axis in the high seas. The moves are slow and well plotted, but moves they are. In the meeting of the central committee of the CPI(M) ? the first under the new general secretary, Mr Prakash Karat ? the party clarified its position on the acceptance of foreign funds by governments run by the CPI(M). Mr Karat announced that foreign funds would be acceptable if they did not come with strings attached. Also, such aid should come for projects which are in the ?national interest?. This is a major but not unexpected turnaround for the CPI(M). In the past, the party has always been vocal against all kinds of foreign funding and against all aid-giving bodies. Foreign aid and foreign capital were, in the party jargon, seen as instruments of neo-imperialism. This change in attitude towards foreign funding has been possible largely at the behest of the chief minister of West Bengal, Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. The experience of West Bengal has made Mr Bhattacharjee realize that it is impossible to cling to the earlier mindset which was opposed to foreign funding and to market forces. He has become an ardent champion of economic reform, and has openly welcomed not only foreign aid but also foreign capital. In fact, some of the major public works projects in Calcutta have been possible because of foreign funding. Mr Bhattacharjee is realistic enough to see that without foreign aid it is impossible to build the infrastructure necessary for attracting investment. The party has now been persuaded to accept Mr Bhattacharjee?s viewpoint.

 Despite this acceptance by the party, some vestiges of the old attitude remain. This is evident in the party?s suspicions about conditions that might be attached to foreign funding. It is important for the CPI(M) to understand that aid-giving bodies, like the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank or any other, are not charitable institutions. In the world of economics ? as in life ? there is no such thing as a free lunch. Aid-giving bodies are bound to impose some conditions ? conditions relating to repayment, completion of projects and so on. There is nothing to fear in all this. No foreign agency that provides aid is interested in eroding the independence and autonomy of a CPI(M)-run government. The CPI(M) is in the process of shedding some of its taboos, it needs to cure itself of its paranoia.

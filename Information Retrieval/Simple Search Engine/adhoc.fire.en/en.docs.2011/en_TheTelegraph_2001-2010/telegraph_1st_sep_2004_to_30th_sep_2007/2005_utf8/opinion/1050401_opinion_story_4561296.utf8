 FOR THE LOVE OF THE HILLS

The relationship between an ambassador and the country 

of his posting is seldom anything more than a professional one. But Deb Mukharji 

is not a run-of-the-mill diplomat. And for a person who ?has been walking in the 

Himalayas accompanied by his camera for over four decades?, it is only appropriate 

that his diplomatic career should come to an end with a stint in the Himalayan 

kingdom of Nepal. The result is THE MAGIC OF NEPAL (Rupa, Price not mentioned). 

The photographs are mostly in colour, with a few, evocative black-and-white ones. 

Expectedly, the largest number of photos are of the mountains. The text is a pleasant 

blend of descriptive narrative, history, personal memory and anecdotes. The map 

at the beginning marks out the mountains and rivers of Nepal. The picture on the 

left shows children at the temple of Changu Narayan.

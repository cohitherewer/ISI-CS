 LIP SERVICE

 Teachers must look dull: that alone would convey the misery of their profession. The impulse behind the circular for teachers in Bonhooghly Girls? High School could have had no other source but this belief. No teacher is allowed to put on lipstick, kajal or long earrings when going to class, since, according to the principal, the school is not ?elite English-medium? but one with a majority of students from low-income families. The sticky, shapeless mess of logic and prejudices in this statement is rather alarming, since it originates from the authorities running the school. Within the list of things prohibited to teachers in class there is an odd man out: the mobile phone. It is not clear whether the authorities consider it a part of ?make-up? or whether the gizmo is supposed to externalize an attitude manifested by lipstick and danglers. The point is, though, that forbidding mobile phones is very different from forbidding lipstick. Mobile phones cause actual disruption and, even symbolically, represent a lack of seriousness about classes.

 But the deepest ? and ugliest ? confusion seems to stem from prejudices about culture. The four young teachers who have refused to comply with the circular and have therefore been banned from taking classes have reacted to a primitive authoritarianism that believes it can decide how colleagues should dress. They have also protested against the disrespect directed at all teachers, because the circular ignores their academic fitness to teach and questions their judgment. Teachers, not being the most powerful socially, are regularly subject to such insults from ?authority?: recently teachers of government schools were told not to smoke. Besides, to cast the logic behind the circular in terms of ?elite English-medium? and ?low-income? is to fall back on the hackneyed ?Western-traditional? dichotomy, through the typical colours of economic disparity. Education is supposed to open up minds, not close them shut. The ridiculous to-do, that took years to die down, about the impropriety of salwar-kameezes in educational institutions pales in comparison with the lipstick ban.

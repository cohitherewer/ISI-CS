 Growing big

 Sir ? India is drawing global attention these days because of its impressive economic performance, bolstered by industrial growth. India is now the world?s 10th largest economy in terms of gross domestic product in the latest World Development Report. It had remained at the 12th position since 1999 and this is the first time ever that the country has joined the top 10 economies of the world, with a GDP of $ 692 billion, pushing South Korea and Mexico behind. It is the second fastest growing economy in the world after China. The major contributory factors to this growth have been stable inflation and interest rates, healthy foreign exchange reserves and rising flow of foreign direct investment. While earlier it was the information technology sector which helped achieve global notice, now it is the manufacturing sector which is showing signs of remarkable growth. This phenomenon will in turn spell growth for other sectors of the economy.

 However, if India wants to join the league of economically advanced nations, it has to take immediate steps to overcome infrastructure bottlenecks. Rural infrastructure such as electricity, roads, irrigation and urban infrastructure such as schools, healthcare and transport, must improve to generate higher employment.

 Yours faithfully,

Masood Md Sohail, Calcutta

 Sir ? There is reason for the euphoria over the 8.1 per cent growth rate in the first quarter of 2005-06, as well as concern about the 50 per cent fall in growth in agriculture, coupled with the under-performance in mining, electricity, gas and water supply. Under such circumstances, it will be too early to say confidently that the growth rate will be sustainable at around 8 per cent. There is already apprehension the urban-rural imbalance may widen, and this may not be unfounded. A steady growth in all sectors is possible if things look up in the agricultural sector as well, with better irrigation, diversification of crops, easy credit, dry-land farming, and so on.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? S.L. Rao makes an important point in his article, ?Making it work better? (Oct 10), but he could be 25 years too late in coming out with it. Yes, manufacturing is important but only pro tanto. This is because India has very little room for manoeuvre in the competitive international market. On the high end, there are countries with cutting-edge technologies such as Japan or South Korea, and on the lower end, there are countries with huge manufacturing capabilities ? often catering to companies from the upper end of the market ? such as China or Vietnam. We have missed the bus in the Seventies; when we were supposed to liberalize our ?import substitution? regime and promote manufacturing, we were content with the abysmal ?Hindu rate of growth?.

 In 2005, India is mainly a service-sector economy ? and that is where its unique selling point lies. We have nothing to attract foreign investors in manufacturing ? stringent labour laws, poor infrastructure, slow-moving babus are deterrents enough. The strength of our economy lies in software development, research and development, business process outsourcing and hopefully, knowledge-process outsourcing in the future. There is nothing wrong about this model. It is also not true that providing jobs en masse in a service-sector economy is a problem. After all, ever since Margaret Thatcher abandoned an uncompetitive manufacturing sector in Britain, Europe?s second largest economy has also been its fastest growing and most prosperous, with one of the lowest rates of unemployment.

 There are two compelling arguments in favour of promoting manufacturing. One, that you should not keep all your eggs in the same basket, that is, one must always promote diversified growth. Two, no sector within the economy should be strangled or its growth impeded. But in essence, the importance of manufacturing has now diminished: India in that respect has the potential to be a 21st century economy, while China is rebuilding a 19th-century model.

 Yours faithfully,

 Festival blues

 Sir ? Are we reducing Durga Puja to mere gimmickry, with our obsession with unconventional idols and themes? The pujas are about joy, creativity and imagination, but it is also about deep-rooted traditions and heritage. Why else do we still listen to the same Mahishasur-mardini in the voice of Birendra Krishna Bhadra so many years running? 

 Yours faithfully,

Indranil Bhanja, Calcutta

 Sir ? This year, like the past few years, the festive season has been marked by the dominance of ?theme pujas? over the traditional pujas around the city. The themes are magnificent, the craftsmanship excellent ? all of which is proof of the talent of the craftsmen of Bengal, who sadly go unnoticed year after year. The footfall at the city pandals runs into thousands, but how many of the visitors care to find out who the craftsmen are? Also, let not too much importance on the ?artistic? value of the idols and pandals rob the Puja of its devotional quotient.

 Yours faithfully,

Soham Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? Television viewers and pandal-hoppers witnessed an unusual phenomenon during this Durga Puja. They saw actors and television personalities participating in a relay adda sponsored by a Bengali TV channel at a city pandal. People were confused; they couldn?t decide whether to pay attention to the deities or to the stars. The puja committee members didn?t seem to know either! I wonder whether such things should be encouraged at all.

 Yours faithfully,

Kasturi Roy Chowdhury, Calcutta

 Sir ? Come Puja, and irregularities, including theft of power, are on the rise. The offenders include the affluent as well. Power theft must invite strong penalty, or it will amount to injustice to honest electricity consumers.

 Yours faithfully,

A.K. Das, Calcutta

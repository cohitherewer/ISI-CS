 FROM THE ASHES

 Old enmities die hard. In the world of sport, the oldest known enmity centres around the Ashes, a small urn containing the ashes of the stumps that were burnt after England lost to Australia at the Oval in 1882 in a hard-fought test match. Since that time, an England-Australia test match series has been called the Ashes. Late on Monday afternoon, at the Oval, England regained the Ashes after 16 years. It was a famous victory made memorable and poignant by the long stint in the cold for the English team and fans, by the fact that victory came against a team considered unbeatable and, of course, by the tremendous cricket played by both sides through the entire series. England won, and won deservedly. But it was the spirit of cricket that triumphed.

 One major factor behind England?s victory was age. England was the younger team consisting of players yet to peak when the series began, and they peaked as the summer progressed. The Aussies were playing to defend their reputation, not to establish it. That parting image of Shane Warne and Glen McGrath leading their teams back to the pavilion in the dying moments of the Oval Test said it all. Neither Warne nor McGrath will ever bowl again in a test match in England. But the English bowlers, Andrew Flintoff, Matthew Hoggard and Steve Harmison, all have many years of cricket left in them. At every crucial point in the series, the English pace attack bowled the Australians out, the Aussie bowlers failed to do this. And this made the difference. Added to this was the ability of the English batsmen to score runs when they were most needed. The knock by Kevin Pieterson on Monday is the best example of this. The Aussie batting line-up rarely came good to turn the game in favour of the green caps. But in the end, in cricketing terms, it was better bowling that won England the Ashes.

 The series also showed what good cricket is all about. First, it is about five days of struggle against bat and ball, and emphatically not about one day?s slogging. Second, the series highlighted the fact that despite enmity and competition, cricket can be played in its proper spirit. The behaviour of both teams was exemplary. Cricket has a long history and tradition ? and much of this tradition is associated with the Ashes ? and this summer in England saw these qualities being upheld and cricket regaining its rightful place as the noblest game. And, what is important, the crowds loved it. It will remain a never-to-be-forgotten summer in England. Glorious sunshine, long twilights as the run stealers flickered to and fro to bring the Ashes home to Lord?s.

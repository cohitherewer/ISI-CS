 FICTION IN THE ARCHIVES

 All for love

LOREDANA: A VENETIAN TALE

By Lauro Martines, 

Jonathan Cape, pound; 9.00

It is rare for a historian to venture into the world 

of fiction. Although, as post-modernists do not cease to point out, the narrative 

techniques used by historians and novelists are the same. The difference ? and 

an important one ? is that the historian?s craft is anchored in facts found in 

documents. The novelist?s strength is his imagination to which he endows a sense 

of reality.

 Lauro Martines is a famous historian who has enriched our knowledge and understanding of Italy in the period of the high Renaissance. His specialization is the history of Florence in that period. In this novel he draws upon his immense knowledge of the history of Italy, Florence and Venice in the early 16th century and on his familiarity of the features of the documentation of the period. This is a novel that grows out of the archives even though none of the documents cited and used here are actually to be found in any archival record room. The documents have been created but their contents have the ring of truth about them.

 The story is a love story with tragic consequences for the lovers. The tragedy is not unexpected given the nature of the relationship. Through a peculiar set of circumstances, a Dominican friar, Orso, and Loredana, the widowed daughter of one of the most powerful men in Venice, get involved in a passionate relationship.

 The affair is set in Venice to which Martines brings Leonardo da Vinci?s vision of an ideal city. Da Vinci wrote, and Martines quotes this as an epigraph to his novel, ?Let the upper streets be for the use only of the nobility, the lower streets for carts, pack animals and the common people. The city should be built near the sea or a big river, so that the filth can be washed away.?? Leonardo?s dream was obviously based on Plato?s Republic: ?Any city, however small, is really two cities, one for the poor and the other for the rich.?? Plato?s dictum serves as another epigraph.

 The Venice that Martines creates has two tiers. The upper tier for the nobility is the city of light; the lower tier for hoi polloi is the city in the shadows. Within the latter is a secret organization called the Third City which wants to clean up crime and corruption. It sees the nobility as the source of corruption. The Venetian Council of Ten, a real organization founded in 1310 by the nobility, had become by the 16th century a kind of secret police committed to discovering subversion and then imposing brutal torture and punishment.

 Orso, a member of the lower city, is arrested by the Ten, for his illicit love affair with Loredana, a member of the nobility. Orso?s crime is further compounded because he is a friar who has broken his vow of celibacy.

 The cleverness and the novelty of the novel lies in the way Martines tells the story. He tells it through a series of documents: a family chronicle, two confessions, a nun?s memoirs, proceedings of the Ten and letters. The mode of telling makes it almost impossible to discern where archives become fiction.

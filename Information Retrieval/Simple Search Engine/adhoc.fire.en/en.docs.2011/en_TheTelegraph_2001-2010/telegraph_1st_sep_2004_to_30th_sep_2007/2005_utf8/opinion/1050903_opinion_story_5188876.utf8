 Letters to Editor

 Just exhibitionism

 Sir ? The report, ?Animal world allows in man? (Aug 27), with snaps of human exhibits in fig leaves, promises a hot saleable commodity straight from the Blue Lagoon for visitors to the zoo. And by publishing this tabloid-style news on the front page, The Telegraph seems to have whetted the appetite of ecologists, animal-lovers and lovers in general at one go. As for India, can it afford to accept Lord Swaraj Paul?s jibe about its being a ?big zoo? with a billion people, without objections? As for Paul, does he think the world can afford to see an emerging India as a ?zoo?? 

 Yours faithfully,

 Surajit Das, Calcutta 

 Travelogue

 Sir ? Cooperation with Afghanistan would be of great advantage to India. With the taliban gone, Pakistan now has less control over Afghanistan. And its hold over its neighbouring state is going to slacken even further in the days to come. First, the gas pipeline from Turkmenistan, passing through Afghanistan, is bound to give it confidence and financial succour. Two, a permanent democracy in Afghanistan will insure it against terrorism. Perhaps the Afghan army can be trained along the lines of the Indian army to safeguard the country. Third, opening up Afghanistan to private entrepreneurs in education will help spread education in this war-ravaged country. Trade ties with India and other nations will help the Afghan economy. 

 Rebuilding Afghanistan will open up as many opportunities for the country itself as for those cooperating with it. However, the biggest concern will be Pakistan, which might try to play spoilsport. Aghanistan-India ties can only be strengthened if Pakistan is kept in check.

 Yours faithfully,

Raghubir Singh, Pune

 Sir ? The warm reception given to the Indian prime minister shows that Afghanistan has travelled a long way from its days of violence. New Delhi?s monetary and moral support to rebuild its ramshackle economy has been a major factor in this journey. The editorial, ?Afghan bank? (Aug 31), sees the Hamid Karzai government as ?the new regime? which is now part of a global project ? of which the United States of America, the Nato, Russia, the United Kingdom and India are all part ? to eradicate terrorism. However, there are certain things that have to be kept in mind. The taliban was nourished by the US and they drove the country back to the stone age. Most of the countries which are now trying to fight terrorism had made no efforts to come to Afghanistan?s rescue then. Today, the country is totally ruined. Even now, Karzai?s influence is limited to Kabul. Unless the world community does more than just ?support? the new regime, the country will return to the taliban-age. Nations cooperating with Afghanistan have to work really hard and keep in mind the US?s ulterior motives in the region.

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? Why was there such a big hype over Rahul Gandhi?s presence in Kabul? Is it just because he is a Nehru-Gandhi? There were other people too who went with Manmohan Singh, but no one attracted as much attention as young Rahul. It was upto the prime minister to decide on the visiting team, and he selected Rahul Gandhi. As for the reasons behind the selection, that is one matter, just as several others that concern us, which should be left to the discretion of the prime minister.

 Yours faithfully, 

Nandini Saraf, Calcutta

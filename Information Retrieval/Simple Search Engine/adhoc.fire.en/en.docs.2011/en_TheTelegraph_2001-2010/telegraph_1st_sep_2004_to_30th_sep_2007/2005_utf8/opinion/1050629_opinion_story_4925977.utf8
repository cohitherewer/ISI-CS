 CHANGED GAME

 Cricket, for its own survival, has to reinvent itself. When in the Seventies it was perceived that test matches were becoming dull, the one day variety of the game was thought of. This brought back spectators to the ground and also increased television viewership. The latter phenomenon was significant since it was connected to sponsorships and endorsements. Thus, one day internationals are directly responsible for the growth in popularity and prosperity of the game of cricket. But over the years, one day internationals have also fallen into a pattern. For example, the batting side sends in a pinch-hitter at the start of the innings because there are fielding restrictions for the first 15 overs. Innovations have turned into orthodoxies. A set pattern is inevitably a recipe for boredom. One-day cricket is not exactly languishing in its popularity but there are signs that it is not as exciting for the spectator as it used to be even five years ago. To bring back excitement to one-day cricket, the International Cricket Council has recommended certain changes in rules and playing conditions which will be on trial for 10 months beginning possibly on July 30.

 Perhaps the most important change that has been suggested is a soccer-style substitution. In cricket, substitutes have never been allowed to bat or bowl. They could only field. But now one substitute who can both bat and bowl will be allowed. This opens up many possibilities. One can now have a captain who will not bat but will be on the field only to marshal his troops. In other words, a player like Mike Brearley, good only as a captain, can make it to a one day eleven since he will not have to bat. Moreover, while fielding, a side might replace a specialist batsman with a specialist bowler. The privileged position that all-rounders enjoyed in one-day cricket will be eroded. The other important change pertains to field restrictions. Currently, not more than two fielders can stand outside the 30-yard circle for the first 15 overs. Under the new rules, this restriction will apply for 20 overs ? the first ten and two blocks of five each to be decided by the fielding captain. The new rules will change the way one day internationals are played. The rule relating to substitutes will have a radical impact. Purists will be justified in turning up their noses but then they have always maintained that one-day cricket is never the real thing.

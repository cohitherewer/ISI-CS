 INEQUALITY IN EQUALITY

 COMMENTARAO / S.L. RAO

 The author is former director general, National Council for Applied Economic Research

 Small consolation

 Inequalities of income are increasing, as also expenditures, especially ostentatious ones. But we cannot resume curtailing the freedom to consume. Philosophically, equality is not what most people want; they want to be better. Pushing for equality merely by reducing the perceived wellbeing of the better off, will not achieve equality. We should aim for growth and concurrently government programmes must improve opportunities for the deprived to rise in society. India is on the path to sustained growth. But India?s poor are many and their incomes and consumption are not rising as fast as those of the rich. Our administrative apparatus and procedures have failed in delivering opportunities to them. Mere allocation of funds without basic reforms in government will not help. 

 India?s tradition of ostentatious expenditures on marriages and religious ceremonies remains. In today?s marriages, the influence of Hindi cinema pervades the country. The exuberance of the Punjabi wedding featured in Mira Nair?s film, Monsoon Wedding, and the colour, music and dances in Hum Aapke Hai Kaun and other such films are replicated in marriages all over India. Even the soporific Bramhin weddings of south India are now much livelier. Ostentation in marriages makes inequalities more obvious. 

 Such public ostentation has since 1991 extended to expenditures on daily consumption, not merely weddings. Imported fruits and a variety of expensive imported foods are now the norm in most upmarket stores. Imported cosmetics, soaps, medicines, and a variety of high-priced goods are freely available and sell well since the opening up of the economy. Imported fabrics, clothing from exclusive brands, plasma television sets, Rolls Royce Silver Cloud and BMW cars, high cost apartments and other goods and services at high prices sell well. 

 The vast majority of India remains very poor. Between two to three hundred million cannot afford two square meals a day. Their purchases of manufactured consumer goods have risen sharply over the last decade but they buy a different class of products. I used National Council of Applied Economic Research data to point out (in writings since 1992) that there was a huge potential class of consumers among the very poor. I developed the concept of an Indian market pyramid. C.K. Prahlad has since identified the poor as an untapped market at the ?bottom of the pyramid?. I had shown then that the bottom of the pyramid was every year moving up into increased consumption of manufactured consumer goods. But the rate of growth of the numbers at the top (?the very rich?) was even faster. Inequality was and is rising. 

 We now have two price classes for products: for the poor (split into the very poor and the ?consuming classes? as I had called them) and the other for the very rich. Price spans range from Rs 4 lakh to Rs 3,000 for TV sets, from Rs 120 per kilogram to Rs 25 for apples, Rs 2 lakh to over Rs 300 lakh for cars, from Rs 35,000 to over Rs 20 lakh for motor cycles, and so on. Wide inequality in incomes and purchasing powers has now embedded itself into the Indian economy. 

 For the very poor whom the data show as buying the odd toilet soap or oil or radio or cassette recorder and little else except necessities, the disparity is made worse by their employment status, depending, as they mostly do, on daily and casual employment and wages. The poor pay more for their food (sugar, oil, pulses), than the rich because they suffer liquidity constraints and so shop more frequently and for small quantities at a time. For that they pay proportionally a lot more than the rich. Thus, the effect of income inequality on them is even more severe. 

 The food intake of the very poor is nowhere near adequate. But many do not receive even the cheap grains to which they are entitled under the public distribution scheme because of poor administration. Ineffective administration also makes almost non-existent the access to decent health care for the rural and the urban poor for routine illnesses. Government hospitals, unavoidable for serious illnesses, are overcrowded, unsafe for women, with few medicines available, doctors who have far too many patients to attend to properly and with bribes to be paid for any attention. This is also a result of inefficient administration. 

 Opportunities for education are poor for those who come from backward social and economic classes. The Supreme Court has ordered governments to stop appropriating a quota of seats from privately funded technical and professional educational institutions for distribution according to government norms. The unanimous outrage among political parties is at least partly because these lower classes will now have even less opportunity to improve. The well-to-do spend fortunes on school education. Their children dominate in admissions to technical and professional institutions (medical, engineering, management). There are few from among the poor of rural areas or small towns and far fewer Dalits. If these deprived classes had better school and college education, the bright ones could gain admission to such institutions purely on merit. 

 But government schools and colleges for the poor are mostly abysmal in quality. Instead of demanding quotas in private professional and technical institutions, governments must make all-out efforts to improve school and college education. After identifying bright students in college from deprived classes, they can be given intensive training in spoken and written English, trained for admission tests and on how to adjust, if they gain admission, to the customs of the different economic class of fellow-students. 

 Must we then, as the anti-globalization crowd demands, dissuade ostentatious consumption through a regime of high import taxes and other indirect taxes? Fifteen years after opening the economy, it is too late for that, apart from its adverse effects on economic growth. Since the Nineties, economic growth has reduced the proportions of the very poor in the population. They lead somewhat better lives than they did before. But the gap between the top 10 per cent and the bottom 30 per cent has certainly increased. The numbers of the very poor remain very high. 

 In any case, do people want to be equal? It is more likely that everyone wants to appear a little better than his or her neighbour. Emotional appeals for equality must change to providing more opportunity for the deprived to improve. Governments have failed in providing such opportunities. 

 Merely throwing vast sums of money into food subsidies, health, education and employment guarantees, will not provide opportunities. The way our governments are organized is guaranteed to prevent spending fully the moneys allocated for such programmes. What is spent does not reach many for whom it is meant, the job is not done honestly or effectively. For example, by itself, the employment guarantee scheme will not achieve its purpose. It will add to corruption and theft. It will make little difference to the lives of most of the deprived. 

 Such schemes should follow serious administrative and government reforms. These must be in structure, procedures, manning, budgeting and increased local responsibility and control. Coordination between different parts of government and between different governments at all levels must become certain and fast. There must be individual accountability of bureaucrats and ministers. Penalties for misusing public moneys must be much more severe and speedily enforced. Without these and other administrative reforms, no social scheme is going to improve the lot of the poor. Without them real inequalities will continue and will rise.

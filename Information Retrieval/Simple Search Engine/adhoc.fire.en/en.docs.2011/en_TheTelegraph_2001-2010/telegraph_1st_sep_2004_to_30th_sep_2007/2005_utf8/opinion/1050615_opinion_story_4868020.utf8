 REMOVE THE BLINKERS

 The French referendum was more a vote on France?s present dispensation than one on the EU, argues Jay Bhattacharjee

 No confusion

 The divide between the citizens of Europe?s oldest republic and its elected representatives could not have been starker. When the French electorate gave a resounding ?Non? verdict in the recent referendum on the European Union, it was not only the French establishment that was shell-shocked. International analysts also went into overdrive, trying to understand the reasons behind the verdict.

 Most of the American media and a large segment of its British counterpart looked for predictable factors. Much was made of the French fear of immigrant labour and there was pontification on French ?xenophobia?, implying that Anglo-Saxons were somehow immune to this cancer. Analysts also emphasized the morosit? of the general populace, but the complexity of the concept eluded most Anglophones. Yet, to many Indian observers, particularly those who have spent time in Calcutta, this is a frame of mind that is immediately recognizable. It is a combination of despair, sulking, cynicism and contempt that Bengalis routinely exhibit.

 However, the Bengali electorate is yet to deliver the resounding rebuff to its rulers, unlike the French and even the voters of Andhra Pradesh. The symptoms underlying the debacles are the same, although there are local variations. In the French case, there was widespread distaste for the rampant corruption in their elite. It has to be said that the French oligarchy is as grubby-fingered as the worst of our lot. This malaise also extends to all political parties, with the socialists and the left being no exception.

 Some of the most blatant venalities took place during the Mitterand era from 1981 to 1985, with the so-called socialist president and many of his top cronies exhibiting behavioural patterns typical of the rulers of a banana republic. However, with public memory being proverbially short, it is likely that the current electorate remembers the more recent shenanigans of the Chiraq gang. For example, there was a finance minister who claimed to be indigent and occupied a luxury Paris apartment at a pittance when his own fortunes were actually substantial. Then there were the numerous corporate scandals. All these factors definitely influenced the average person on the street, coupled with the fact that France has never managed to restrict its unemployment rate in recent times to less than 10 per cent for any length of time.

 Nevertheless, the categorical no in the referendum also raised certain fundamental issues that the French want their representatives to address. And these, equally, are issues that also bother the Indian voters. The common concerns facing both the peoples pertain to the working of an economy in a democratic and pluralist society, and the appropriate policy framework that would best meet the needs of the electorate.

 The EU constitution and the presentations of the mainstream political groups seemed to the French voter nothing but jargon that did not spell out any clear doctrine or system. It was much the same in these shores last year. The core issues are quite simple. In India, if we choose to give up a command economy and change to a system where consumer preferences are the principal force, how do we ensure that the basic objectives of a fair, equitable, transparent and prosperous order are attained?

 In France (and indeed in other countries of western Europe like the Netherlands and the United Kingdom), the dilemma is similar. In a globalized world, where competitiveness is the order of the day, how does a developed society ensure that its social security net and welfare system will not be jettisoned? The ruling French elite and the corporate honchos kept on telling the ordinary citizen that market forces are best at decision-making, that big corporations know everything, that social investment in education and health will be catered to only if surplus resources are available, and that infrastructure will be emphasized only for the promotion of private business interests.

 At the end of the day, citizen Jacques and the eponymous Marianne (the symbol of the French republic) just did not buy the thesis. The contradiction between economic efficiency and a viable social welfare structure was not accepted by the French populace. There are a number of reasons for this. First, French voters clearly had a much closer knowledge of a development model that is at the other end of the spectrum from the Anglo-Saxon system. Recent research has definitively shown that the Nordic development paradigm has clear advantages over its American-British counterpart. Analysts in France like Jean Gadrey and Walter Corpi in Sweden have categorically shown that the Anglo-Saxon prototype, touted so enthusiastically by the Blairs and Bushes of this world, has basic defects.

 Gadrey, in his study of the employment pattern in developed countries, noted that social services constitute a higher percentage of total employment in the Nordic countries (Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland) than in the the Anglo-Saxon countries. Public employment and public resources (as a percentage of the GDP) are also significantly higher in the former, and social service and public employees there have higher levels of qualification and training than their equivalents in Britain and the US. Furthermore, minimum statutory wages in the Nordic countries and France are much higher than that in the US.

 Free-market exponents invariably bring up the issue of the poorer overall economic performance of the Nordic countries. This is nothing but a myth. The northern European countries have routinely fared better in pure economic terms than their ideological rivals, whether in terms of GDP growth, income distribution norms, purchasing power parity, or human development indices. If we look at the number of industrial patents registered on a per capita basis, Sweden is way ahead of the US. When it comes to corporate and state governance or administrative transparency, the race is over. In the Transparency International table, the US rank is 16, while the Nordics are all in the first seven.

 This is what the French (and the Dutch) voted for. Other matters like Turkey and immigration from east Europe were bagatelles. There is a major lesson here for Indian policy-makers, particularly the new lot in Raisina Hill. Growth versus equity is a false bogey that takes us away from the real policy issues. An equitable social order promotes growth and no amount of shadow-boxing by vested interests can sweep this under the carpet.

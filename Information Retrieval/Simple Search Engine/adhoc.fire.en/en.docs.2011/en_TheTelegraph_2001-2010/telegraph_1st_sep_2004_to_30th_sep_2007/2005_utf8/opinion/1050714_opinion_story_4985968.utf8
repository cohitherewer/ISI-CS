 OUT OF THE WAY

 How a law works depends largely on what the politicians make of it. If the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunals) Act did not work in Assam, it was because successive Congress governments used it as an excuse for their inaction. The governments? unwillingness to act had more to do with politics than with the actual difficulties in implementing the law. When it was enacted in 1983, it was meant to help the state government identify and deport illegal settlers in Assam, mostly from Bangladesh. Even the Congress, which defended the law, agreed that it had completely failed to serve its purpose. Now, the Supreme Court has struck it down as ?unconstitutional? and declared that its purpose could be served better by the Foreigners? Act. This gives an edge to the argument by opponents of the IM(DT) Act, who complained that it had been used to actually prevent the identification of illegal migrants in Assam. The act, in their view, was aimed at the Muslim vote bank in the state. 

 Even if this argument has its own political bias, there is no denying that the issue has caused deep divisions within Assamese society since the enactment of the law. It has made the majority community live in constant fear of being swamped by illegal settlers. And this fear sparked off not only the violent Assam agitation of the early Eighties but also the Nellie massacre of 1983. For far too long, the controversial law has dominated Assam?s politics, almost to the exclusion of the issues of governance. The chief minister, Mr Tarun Gogoi, would do well not to start a fresh controversy by enacting another law on the issue. The law?s critics ? the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Asom Gana Parishad and the All Assam Students? Union ? also bear a major responsibility in the new situation. They must not use the repeal of the law to launch an anti-minority campaign. If a majority community?s xenophobia can trigger communal tensions, so can a minority group?s fear of persecution. The parties need to be cautious, especially in view of the state assembly elections early next year. 

 But the most important lesson of the Supreme Court verdict is for the whole country. Assam may have been particularly affected by illegal migration because of historical reasons. But the problem exists in many other parts of the country. As in Assam, politicians elsewhere have been guilty of conniving at it in the interest of their electoral politics. West Bengal?s leftist rulers have long been accused of helping illegal settlers from Bangladesh become voters. The politics over the influx of Bangladeshis has gradually overshadowed the larger issue of the threat to demography and national security. It is time political parties and governments treated the question of illegal settlers as a major national concern.

 Letters to Editor

 Unfair play

 Sir ? The Australian team has continued to tour England despite the terrorists? strike in London (?Australia push security up the agenda?, July 9). One must applaud the Aussies for the courage they showed on and off the field. But I was just wondering if they would have stayed on if the matches were being played in an Asian country. In that case, they would have packed their bags and left for home after issuing travel warnings to other nations. Did I hear someone say hypocrites? 

 Yours faithfully,

Atul Kundra, Dubai

 Money for nothing

 Sir ? While Ashok Guha?s ruminations on the connection between happiness and prosperity were absorbing enough, one wished he had not shied away from defining happiness (?The happiness paradox?, July 13). According to psychologists, all human beings have something called a happiness index, which keeps them ticking along on one particular level. The level often changes, especially under distressing conditions like injustice, passion, grief or abject poverty. The alteration, however, is only temporary. For example, in corporate houses, those who get a salary raise feel elated, but only for a while. The point is, happiness is a fleeting sensation and not a statistical aggregate that can be correlated to macroeconomic indices. 

 Similarly, Guha?s other contention that the suicide rate is an ?irrefutable behavioural index of unhappiness? is debatable. If psychiatrists are to be believed, the concept of ?unhappiness? is pass?; it has been replaced by the word ?depression?in their lexicon. There is little reason to think that the semantic distinction is trivial, for dissatisfaction with life is now regarded as a pathological condition which can be cured. I suppose penury can afflict the mind seriously enough for one to contemplate suicide, but so can other non-economic factors like depression or schizophrenia. Like the man who used to detect Marxism in multiplication tables, must we bring in much-maligned terms such as ?GDP? and ?economic growth? into everything?

 Yours faithfully,

H.M. Hangla, Calcutta

 Sir ? Ashok Guha raises some interesting points about prosperity and happiness. However, it is difficult to agree with Guha when he says that economic prosperity does not improve the human lot. John Stuart Mill had talked about ?higher? and ?lower? pleasures. Men may pursue ?higher? pleasures, but only when their material needs have been met. For instance, it would be impossible for poor Indians, living below the poverty line, to appreciate poetry. Moreover, the history of human civilization shows that periods of socio-cultural stability have invariably been preceded by phases of sustained economic growth. 

 It cannot be denied that in the West, men and women are often unhappy despite their wealth. This is the cause of the rise in suicide rates that Guha talks about. Therefore, the urge to end one?s life is not born out of the lack of basic amenities alone. In a poor country such as ours, we cannot ignore the importance of material needs. Indians must strive to ensure that economic growth caters to all sections of society, and that there is a balance in the pursuit of higher and lower pleasures. 

 Yours faithfully,

Aruni Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? Indian philosophers have always preferred the spiritual life over one governed by materialism. Unfortunately, money is seen as the most important factor in determining happiness today. Perhaps, it?s time we stopped doing so in order to unlock the secret of a really happy and stable life.

Yours faithfully, 

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad

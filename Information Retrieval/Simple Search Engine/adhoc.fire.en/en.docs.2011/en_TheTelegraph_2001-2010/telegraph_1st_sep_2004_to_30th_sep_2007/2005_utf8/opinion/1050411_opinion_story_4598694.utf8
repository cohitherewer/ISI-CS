 WILL TO FIGHT

 A great deal of violence in India springs from the crudest abuse of political power. This is most often a mix of systemic lawlessness and individual aberration. Mr Sanjay Bakshi perfectly illustrates this phenomenon. As Trinamool Youth Congress president, Mr Bakshi regards himself as some sort of a ?political? leader with the backing of a political party and its cadre. And this self-image is a question not only of personal machismo, but also of public immunity from the law. Mr Bakshi?s latest display of power involved brutally beating up Mr Vivek Sharma, an eighteen-year-old higher secondary candidate, after knocking him down with his car. Mr Bakshi then eluded the police for a couple of days, tried to intimidate Mr Sharma and his family into dropping the case against him, and then surrendered to the police in order to be promptly released on bail. Throughout this episode, Mr Bakshi has maintained that this was a conspiracy against him and his party by the ruling left, and he has the support of his party chief in this allegation. 

 There is another kind of implicit support that Mr Bakshi enjoys. The agency of the police in never finding him at home, after most of his eruptions, is certainly significant. Traffic policemen, constables and sergeants regularly get roughed up by Mr Bakshi and his men. But it is always easy for him to get released on bail. This silent understanding between party and police, whatever the political regime, is what gives a systemic dimension to Mr Bakshi?s abuse of power. Yet, in this particular case, the reaction and the persistence of Mr Bakshi?s ?victim? remain remarkable. Mr Sharma is a very young student, without any of the empowering advantages that Mr Bakshi enjoys. But he has persisted with the police in registering his protest against Mr Bakshi?s offence. In his remaining the fearless citizen lies one way out of this regime of violence. Mr Sharma hopes to go to court, and if Mr Bakshi?s party pressurizes him, he even plans to approach the Election Commission. But pitted against this ordinary citizen?s courage of conviction is an entire system of abuse and violence that implicates every element in the mechanism of law and order, particularly the police and a cadre-based party ethos. Fighting this, individually and collectively, is certainly an imperative. The health and stability of Bengal?s civil society and polity will depend on the outcome of this fight.

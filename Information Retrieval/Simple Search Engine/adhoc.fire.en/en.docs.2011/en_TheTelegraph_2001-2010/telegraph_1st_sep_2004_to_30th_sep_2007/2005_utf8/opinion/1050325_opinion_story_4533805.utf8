 FOR NOTHING

 When, in the not-so-distant past, Mr L.K. Advani was the deputy prime minister of India, he declared that politics in India was no longer about ideology but about governance. Everyone concerned with good governance had then breathed a sigh of relief since the Bharatiya Janata Party is known to be an ideologically-driven party. Mr Advani?s declaration was interpreted to mean that support to issues would be determined not on whether they pushed forward the BJP?s ideological programme but on the basis of the contribution the issues would make to good governance. As long as the BJP was in power and as long as it ran the National Democratic Alliance, the BJP advocated good governance. It drafted the patents bill and it laid down the groundwork for the value-added tax. The BJP leaders were vocal against disrupting proceedings in parliament. There could not be a better champion for the cause of good governance.

 It has now become clear that the BJP?s commitment to good governance is less than skin-deep. It is even shallower ? if such a thing is conceivable ? than its advocacy of secularism. Out of power, it has done a complete volte-face and has thrown good governance out of the window. It showed its opposition to the patents bill by walking out of the Lok Sabha. This was bizarre since the bill, as it stands, was practically drafted by the NDA government. The BJP has expressed its disapproval of VAT even though the idea took concrete shape under the aegis of the NDA government. It would appear that the BJP?s support or otherwise to an issue is dependent not on ideology or on good governance but on whether it is in power or not. The BJP believes that since it is in opposition, it has to oppose. This is, by no reckoning, adult behaviour.

 It would be unfair to the BJP to say that it is the only political party which behaves in this juvenile manner. All the other principal political parties behave in the same way. Their attitude and behaviour undergo a transformation as soon as they are out of power. This lack of consistency ? perhaps a sign of immaturity ? has become the bane of Indian politics. This inconsistency grows out of the fact that political parties are more concerned with furthering their vested interests and in nurturing their constituencies than in pursuing issues of good governance and national interests. A political party like the BJP, which claims national status for itself, cannot afford to be short-sighted. If it wants to lead, it must have the political will to do what it thinks is good for the country. It cannot do flip-flops or attack issues haphazardly like a child?s first attack on a meccano set. One of the reasons that the political class in India has lost all credibility is that it does not stand for anything. Support to an issue or lack of it is based on sheer convenience ? or worse, on opportunism.

 Knowledge power

 Sir ? When India creates ripples abroad for anything other than Aishwarya Rai, it always feels good. The recent New Scientist story on ?India: The Next Knowledge Superpower? is a recognition of what our country is capable of. But the ?knowledge revolution? that the story talks about is a covert way of letting the world know that India is more than a destination for the call-centre industry. When will our policy-makers realize that it is our reserve of brain-power which has brought in more investors to the country than their policies, or the lack of them.

 Yours faithfully,

 It?s my money

 Sir ? The finance minister?s proposal for a 0.1 per cent tax on drawing Rs 10,000 and above in a single day is understandable as an effort to track down black money in the country. But one wonders why he is not making it mandatory for all nursing homes to accept only account payee cheques. Almost all these institutions insist on cash payment ? which makes it really easy for holders of black money to dispose of it. Also, why are stamp duties and court fees accepted in cash only? 

 Has the finance minister considered the additional expense and administrative pressure that banks will be facing for disbursing Rs 9,999 in cash to millions of customers? Neither does he seem to have any idea of the daily sales of some of our pavement hawkers, sellers of vegetables, fish and meat, and kirana shops, where the system of cash memos do not exist?

 Yours faithfully,

Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

 Sir ? P. Chidambaram?s claim that the imposition of 0.1 per cent tax on cash withdrawals of over Rs 10,000 has been done to curb ?cash spending which fuel a black, untaxed economy?, does not sound convincing. As far as I know, few holders of black money keep their tainted money in banks. If Chidambaram really wants to unearth black money, he should lure black money holders into keeping money in the bank by offering higher interest to depositors of, say, over Rs 50 lakh. Of course, the left, only interested in playing to the gallery, will oppose such a move. But this should be ignored, since good economics never makes good politics.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? If each cash withdrawal of Rs 10,000 or more means losing Rs 10, who will bother to deposit his surplus in a bank? This policy will certainly deal a blow to the saving habit of people. In a developing economy like India, the government ought to encourage a habit of saving among the masses, by introducing incentives and organizing awareness programmes. It is best that the government sees sense and revokes the regulation before it is enforced. Or, people may soon go back to the ancient ways of hiding money and treasure under the ground.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The Union finance minister has made a move in the right direction by introducing a nominal tax on cash withdrawals exceeding Rs 10,000 from a bank account in a single day. But a few other steps need to be taken to curb black money. All sale-purchases exceeding, say, Rs 20,000 must be through banks though payment may be made in parts. In case of cash payments, currency-tax of around 30 per cent may be levied. Payments of services like water, telephone, electricity and municipal taxes for bills exceeding Rs 1,000 must be made in cheques. Circulation of ?benami? drafts must be effectively checked by reducing their validity to just 45 days. Drafts/pay-orders/ traveller-cheques must carry the name, address and account-number of the purchaser. Finally, use of plastic money must be encouraged.

 Yours faithfully,

S.C. Agrawal, Delhi

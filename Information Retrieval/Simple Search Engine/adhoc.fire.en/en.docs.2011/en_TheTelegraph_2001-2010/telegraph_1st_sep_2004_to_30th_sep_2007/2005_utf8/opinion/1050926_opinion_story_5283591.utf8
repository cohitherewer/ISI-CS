 NOT IN SICKNESS

 In sickness and in health ? but with important exceptions. Public health awareness in India is bringing about significant changes in social institutions like marriage. The main catalyst has, of course, been HIV/AIDS, the preventive measures for which are fast providing the model for tackling other diseases like thalassaemia. A local association of Hindu priests in North 24 Parganas has decided that its members would refuse to conduct the rituals for weddings in which the bride and the groom have not undergone HIV and thalassaemia tests. Not only have the priests come to this collective decision, but they have also been campaigning actively in their area about this decision and its implications. This looks like progressive and practical thinking, which has been lauded by the state AIDS control organization. This is correct, to a very great extent, and it is important for bodies as traditional as these religious ones to take on board the implications of such measures.

 Yet, there is room for misgivings here. What if two people who test positive for either of these conditions choose to get married in full knowledge of this? Would these priests then refuse to solemnize their wedding? And, if they do, then would this be just? There are serious human- rights issues involved here which will have to be thought through. Is it at all permissible to force people to undergo such tests, and what is the role of consent in all this? The government authorities have also said that the priests? decision would help in removing the stigma on HIV/AIDS. The logic of this is not entirely clear. Recognizing that people living with HIV/AIDS are also entitled to all the various aspects of ?normal? life is essential to undoing stigmatization. Publicizing HIV/AIDS in terms of what one ought not to be allowed to do if one is HIV+ is perhaps not the best way to ensure social justice for them. Besides, stringently disallowing marriage for HIV+ and thalassaemic people is to reduce the function of marriage to procreation. Two people with a difficult medical condition might choose to marry for reasons of mutual care and companionship, and might build their marriage on a decision to not have children. Such options and relationships are also part of the newer ways of thinking, living and relating to other human beings that HIV/AIDS has begun to necessitate in conservative societies.

 SEVEN BROTHERS

 The vice-chancellor of Jadavpur University, Mr Ashok Nath Basu, must have been deeply reassured. Seven of his peers, the vice-chancellors of seven universities in West Bengal, have come out in public support of Mr Basu?s decision to allow the police into the campus. Such solidarity in the face of overwhelming ? no doubt unreasonable ? criticism, must be heart-warming, especially since the chief minister himself has managed to come out with a mild disclaimer that letting the police loose on students is not the policy of his government. Evidently, the vice-chancellors of West Bengal are willing to go the extra mile. That would impose on students and guardians, and anybody who is concerned about the ambience of educational institutions in the state, the sacred duty of unravelling the implications of the vice-chancellors? message.

 One, it is perfectly acceptable to take close to two years to come to a decision about a violent incident on the campus. Where firm and immediate punishment of all, and not a selected group, of the guilty students would have been considered not only just, but also reassuring for everyone, an opaque and dilatory process confused the original issue and invited charges of political bias. Two, seeking help from the state to break up a protest is fine, as long as the police come at the dead of night, with instructions to make sure that the fasting students and their supporters learn the lesson of their lives. Three, it is the essence of authority not to take responsibility. Some innocent citizens may have had the impression that anyone who calls the police is supposed to be present when the police come. Evidently, that was also the impression of the police, since they reportedly tried contacting the registrar, who had gone to bed. There are other implications, but these will do for the moment. They make quite clear what can be expected of the state?s universities. Only when the protests are led by the Students? Federation of India, are the rules different. The director of medical education himself is dealing with the SFI-led protests in North Bengal Dental College.

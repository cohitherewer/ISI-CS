 PASCAL PREPARES

 Nations are equal in theory and fractious in practice; the politics of international institutions can be Byzantine and convoluted. As a result, international organizations have evolved methods of choosing heads that are democratic in form but mirror the underlying balance of power. The World Trade Organization missed evolving such conventions because its forebear, the International Trade Organization, did not get the approval of the US congress in the Forties and continued as an ad hoc General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade till 1996. Its test came when the choice of a director general became due in 1999. The member countries were divided between Mr Supachai Panitchpakdi, the Thai commerce minister, and Mr Mike Moore, once prime minister of New Zealand. The United States of America did not trust Mr Panitchpakdi, who it felt came from the Japanese sphere of influence. New trade negotiations were being talked about; the US was keen that they should be organized so as to open up markets for services. It felt more comfortable with Mr Moore in this role. In the compromise that was worked out: Mr Moore became director general first, followed by Mr Panitchpakdi. As the tenure of the pair neared its end in 2004, the member countries worked out a procedure for selection of their successor, involving a beauty contest ? candidates got two months to exhibit themselves to members ? and a behind-the-scenes consultation process to establish who had most support.

 That process has led to the appointment of Mr Pascal Lamy, a member of France?s elite financial civil service, confidante of Mr Jacques Delors, and a habitu? of Brussels, the capital of the European Union. He has already chosen his cabinet of four deputy directors general ? amongst them, Mr Harsha Vardhana Singh, who left the coveted post of the WTO director general?s chef de cabinet in 1997 to take up the secretaryship of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India that was just being set up. After eight years of fruitless labour, he obviously thinks that international trade diplomacy would be less frustrating than telecom regulation.

 Mr Moore started preparations for a new round at the ministerial meeting at Doha in December 2001. But the developing countries were deeply suspicious of the WTO venturing into what were called Singapore issues ? trade and investment, competition policy, and transparency in government procurement. They mounted an attack on agricultural subsidies, on which industrial countries would concede little. The debate continued in the Cancun ministerial in 2003, but led nowhere. This is the background against which Mr Lamy must now prepare for the ministerial in Hong Kong this coming December, which will test all his brahminical skills. As he looks across Lake Geneva from his office window, he must wonder when the next storm will cross the waters. But then, he is no stranger to stormy waters.

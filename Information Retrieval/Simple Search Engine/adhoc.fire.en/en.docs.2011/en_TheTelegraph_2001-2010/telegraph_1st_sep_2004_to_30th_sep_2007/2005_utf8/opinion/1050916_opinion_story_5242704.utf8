 THROUGH THICK AND THIN

 The Family in India: Structure and Practice Edited

 by Tulsi Patel, 

 Sage, Rs 650

 This is the sixth and second-last volume in the ?Themes in Indian Sociology? series, published to commemorate the golden jubilee of the Indian Sociological Society. And the editors dispense their duty by publishing articles from the Sociological Bulletin, brought out by the Society since 1952. 

 The editor of this volume admits that she had ?a lurking diffidence about the relevance of such a volume?. She, however, manages to get over the discomfort by recalling Weber and his prediction that scientific accomplishments will be ?antiquated? eventually. Tulsi Patel thus goes ahead with the reprinting of select articles that have to be appreciated either for their ?artistic quality? or for their importance to sociological training.

 Yet in the passage that Patel quotes, Weber also talks about scientific ?fulfilment? raising new ?questions?. The works republished here do not seem to have been successful in doing that. Had they been, the sociological interest in the ?family? would not have been so restricted ? of the seminal articles here, 10 were written in the Fifties, four in the Sixties, one in 1998 and another in 1992. 

 The editors agree that research into the ?family? has received short shrift by separate investigations into marriage practices, caste ties and the more exacting study of gender discrimination. If that be the case, wouldn?t it have been better to use the commemorative volume as an occasion to look more intently into a time that is experiencing unprecedented changes in family structures, processes and values? Why is it so important to re-affirm the Fifties? postulate that the disintegration of the Indian joint family is largely a myth? Is it merely to stop researchers from asking ?meaningless? questions to unsuspecting respondents on whether they belong to a ?joint or a nuclear family?? 

 The last, in fact, is a major concern for the sociologists here. Through their ?methodological, conceptual and analytical tools? they clear the cobwebs from various sociological constructs connected with the family ? concepts of joint/nuclear (the issue of jointness delinked from the sole criterion of joint residence), family/household (the latter as a ?unit of observation?), simple/ complex households, housegroups/households and so on. 

 Patel tries to keep away from ?the politics of discourse on the family.? She merely tries to put together the major developments in the study of the family in India ? of its nature, processes and structures. But there are relevant questions Patel herself asks ? What are the pressures the family is undergoing in the face of societal changes? What are its the experiences on the emotional, conjugal, financial and consumerist fronts? How are relationships negotiated and renegotiated in the light of changes in the larger society? But the already lived experiences of the Marwaris, the Nayars, the Khatris are not sufficient enough to answer them. There is need for more contemporaneity in our sociology.

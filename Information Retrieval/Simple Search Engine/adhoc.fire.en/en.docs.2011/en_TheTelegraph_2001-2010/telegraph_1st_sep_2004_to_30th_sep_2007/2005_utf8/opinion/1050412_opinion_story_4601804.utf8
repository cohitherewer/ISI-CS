 WITH ENEMIES ALL AROUND

 Malavika Singh

 The impression that the ruling coalition in Delhi is giving the outside world is that everything is pending and movement is slow, that there is a lack of energetic thinking, reform and change, that the bureaucrats are making sure that there is a stalemate on every decision. The administration is being seen as working silently and ominously against its political masters. It is becoming increasingly apparent that the senior bureaucracy today is partisan and against this coalition.

 If one looks dispassionately at this stark reality and tries to comprehend why this is so, it becomes clear that the previous dispensation at the Centre, masterminded by a shrewd bureaucrat, a college pal of the last prime minister, carefully slotted handpicked people in the posts of joint secretaries in critical ministries starting with the PMO and moving on to many other ministries like environment, home et al. They owe their placement and promotion to the last lot. The present prime minister, believing that he was beginning to administer a corrective by assuming that the administrative cadre continues to remain non-partisan, has merely allowed his and the coalition?s detractors to continue ruling the roost. They have no respect for the present leadership and see it as a stop-gap arrangement. They are not committed to any real change because it would expose and undermine them. There is enough empirical evidence of that floating about if someone chose to find it.

 Crossed files

 Manmohan Singh just does not have a loyal and committed team. The PMO is slow and complacent, some of its incumbents try to push through unfinished agendas that were part of unacceptable policies of the past. As I write, there are reports lying on the dusty desk of a secretary in the PMO, asking for time to discuss outcomes of ordered investigations that do not even reach the the desk of the prime minister. Matters are shoved to the bottom of the pending file to protect inept colleagues in other ministries, time is spent planning cover-ups instead of thinking out correctives. The prime minister is being misled and, more often than not, being kept in the dark. It is beginning to look like deliberate strategy to embarrass him, which is a betrayal as well as intellectual corruption and a breach of service rules and conduct. The ?steel frame? has reduced itself to putty as it becomes more and more incompetent.

 And third...

 With expertise in all disciplines confronting us, the babu with his limited knowledge is fast becoming a hindrance. His inability to comprehend the language and thinking of a new generation of world citizens which has overtaken him intellectually, has left him insecure and therefore overactive in malignant manipulation, the last resort being to harass and malign. Bureaucrats of today are a far cry from those of the past. Instead of the L.K. Jhas and the B.K. Nehrus of an India of the past, those who strut the cocktail circuit today makes one shudder with unease. The mindset is so limited, the aspiration so pedestrian.

 The banter in Delhi is that the opposition, despite being off the treasury benches, is continuing to rule and get its unfinished agendas completed through its well-placed bureaucrats ? which is why this coalition will not be able to deliver the goods as per its promise. And, with the left as its coalition partner heaping political abuse on the Congress with the recent spiel about their dream of supporting a third front, the incumbent leadership better crack the whip and fight for what it believes in. If we just look at the track record of ?third front? coalitions and consensus candidate prime ministers that have ruled India, all I can say is god help Bharat Mata.

 THE BIG SLEEP

 John Maynard Keynes died in 1946 and Mr P. Chidambaram was born in 1945. Had it not been for a few months, it could be argued that Keynes has been reincarnated as Mr Chidambaram. This is significant because of the thrust given to government expenditure in the common minimum programme. 

 Given the common minimum programme, a case is made out in the Economic Survey for greater government expenditure in social sectors like health and education. The survey simultaneously argues against government expenditure in physical infrastructure, arguing it is inefficient and leads to no tangible improvement in outcomes. That argument extends equally well to social infrastructure or physical infrastructure in rural areas. Policy measures in the budget concern greater public expend- iture through various schemes. Two questions, however, remain unanswered. 

 First, in these areas, is the case for market failure established? Second, assuming state intervention is required, should there not be a difference between financing and providing? The United Progressive Alliance will argue that there is reference to public-private partnerships in skill development and possible NGO involvement in micro-credit. But this is no more than tokenism. Given the distinction between panchayats and gram sabhas, with the latter non-functional in most states, it is doubtful that euphoria about accountability and transparency increasing by decentralization through panchayati raj institutions, as proposed in Bharat Nirman, will work. The task of linking expenditure to measurable improvements in outcomes has also been left to the Planning Commission. In contrast, policy-level reforms remain mere promises ? small-scale industries de-reservation or liberalization of foreign direct investment in mining, trading and pensions. 

 If at policy level, the only substantive changes are flexibility in statutory liquidity ratio and cash reserve ratio, why is the 2005-06 budget being labelled as a second dream one? The answer lies in negative expectations, increase in government expenditure having been regarded as inevitable, courtesy the CMP. There is relief that service sector taxation has not increased to 12 per cent, no significant new services have been brought into the net, threshold levels of personal and service sector taxation have increased and the peak corporate tax rate (for domestic companies) has dropped to 30 per cent. But because depreciation allowance has dropped to 15 per cent for corporate taxation and exemptions, and standard deductions eliminated for personal income, without reading the fine print, it is not obvious that effective tax rates have declined across-the-board. 

 This fine print is more than the two unnecessary provisions on black income that so upset members of parliament. There is indeed some rationalization of excise and also customs. There is no big bang tax reform in the budget. And numbers add up because Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act commitments have been effectively postponed by a year and because of optimistic projections on revenue. Clearly, there are no dreams in deep sleep.

 M, F, E OR MORE?

 There are always those who are thrown completely off-balance when faced with a form to fill. It seems that one innocent soul once wrote ?Quite often, thank you? in the column marked ?Sex?. Now that the choice for that space has expanded to three options instead of the traditional two on passport application forms, the innocent may be even more confused. But the expansion is extraordinarily good news for a huge community of human beings in India who find themselves at a loss when forced to identify themselves as either male or female. The new option, ?E? for ?eunuch?, introduced into the website version of the passport form, is the first official recognition of a different gender-option in this country. The existence of the hijra or eunuch community has never been a secret. The fact that it is made up largely of individuals whose sexual or gender identity does not fit into the two-gender division of society is precisely the reason they are perceived as outcasts, although accepted at certain rituals. To recognize them officially for the first time in 2005 is also to demonstrate their severe lack of rights. Even the exact size of the community is unknown; one estimate puts transgendered people in India at 25 to 30 million.

 The urge to be part of the mainstream of society, and to have the right to vote in their own chosen identity, had been growing in the community for quite some time. The movement that developed led to the Election Commission?s direction to its officials in 1993 to include eunuchs on the electoral rolls. Ironically, they had never been banned, because the Constitution forbids discrimination on the basis of gender. But most were overlooked in the counting, or they had to register as ?male?, often against their wishes, or were too embarrassed to go to the booths where derisive questions would be raised about their sexual identity. 

 The EC?s direction had two immediate results. There were suddenly eunuchs winning municipal elections, producing remarkably successful councillors and mayors, efficient and demonstrably honest. It also brought to the surface, within the community, the debate over an identity everyone could accept. Not all were agreeable to ?female?, and others felt unhappy with ?eunuch?. This is only to be expected, since eunuchs form only a part, even if it is a large part, of a space also inhabited by transsexuals, inter-sexed people, transvestites and hermaphrodites. ?Third sex? or ?third gender? has been finding some favour, paradoxically perhaps, because it is the slippage between sex and gender which is very much a cause of their rejection of the two-gender division. So while the new category on the passport form is welcome, certain questions persist. What about people in the community who are not ?E?? When will these changes begin to be introduced into all other forms? And when will the differently identified people be accepted as equals in everyday transactions?

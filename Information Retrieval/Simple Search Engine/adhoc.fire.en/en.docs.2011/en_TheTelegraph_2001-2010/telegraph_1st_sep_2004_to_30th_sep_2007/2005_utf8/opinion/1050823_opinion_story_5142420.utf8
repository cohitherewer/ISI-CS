 POOR JOKE

 What do India?s poor want and what keeps them poor? If the poor are those in the workforce of 400 million, or their dependents, what keeps them poor is the lack of access to health, education, credit, skills, physical connectivity and market information, and the poor certainly want employment. This is not to deny that there are poor and hungry people who are old and disabled and for them, other anti-poverty programmes are necessary. It is also possible to think of scenarios where the able-bodied poor suffer from temporary unemployment. Ipso facto, if delivery can be ensured, there is a case for providing social security (of which unemployment insurance is one dimension). 

 However, that is not what the national rural employment guarantee bill is about, since unemployment insurance forms one small component of the bill. In addition, since the national commission on enterprises is reportedly drafting social security bills for the informal sector, including rural India, unemployment insurance should be part of those provisions. Nor should one object if, given market failures, the government intervenes through providing physical or social infrastructure and connectivity, the kind of provisions contemplated in the Bharat Nirman programme. However, one should note that the efficiency of government expenditure is doubtful and has led to no tangible improvement in outcomes. Had that not been the case, two per cent of gross domestic product spent annually in the name of rural development would have changed rural India. Guaranteeing employment is a ridiculous idea that not even socialist countries experiment with today.

 Expenditure, and finding resources, are indeed issues. Figures vary on annual expenditure ? from Rs 40,000 crore to upwards of Rs 200,000 crore ? on the rural employment guarantee in its full form, that is, beyond the initial 200 districts. One should note that there are already demands to extend it beyond the stipulated 100 days and to urban areas. Unless existing schemes are diverted, there are opportunity costs for these resources and 10 per cent has to come from the states. That apart, the scheme now covers all households (not just below-the-poverty-line ones) and the cash component has been fixed at Rs 60 per day, translating into a figure (including the non-cash component) higher than minimum wages in many poor states. Such a scheme may have been a national common minimum programme guarantee, but no one has yet demonstrated how leakage and corruption can be eliminated. The Right to Information Act and civil society vigilance are neither here nor there, and several states will not even be able to think of appropriate projects.

 Down the drain

 Sir ? The city roads may be caked with dirt but Calcuttans are very particular about keeping their bodies squeaky clean. And why not, considering they end up wasting a copious amount of water during their bath (?Great bathing ghat?, Mar 31)? The ground-water levels in the city have been going down at an alarmingly rate for some time now and the Calcuttan?s love for his bath is just one of the reasons for this. There are also the unscrupulous promoter who tanks up more water than that permitted by the law; and the leaking pipes and open taps that are a familiar sight on Calcutta?s streets. An unperturbed mayor, apart from issuing perfunctory warnings, has done little to implement water conservation measures in the city. If nothing is done to check the wastage of water, then our days of taking leisurely showers are surely numbered. 

 Yours faithfully,

Nitai Sen, Calcutta

 Paper tigers 

 Sir ? Many cricket experts had described the present Pakistan team as the ?weakest ever? to tour India (?Indians hand match on a platter, March 29). But with its lion-hearted performance in the third test match in Bangalore, the visitors have made the pundits eat their own words. Pakistan not only won the match but also won the hearts of Indian cricket fans with their determined showing on the field. The Indians, however, can only blame their batsmen for the defeat. The fact that a tailender like Anil Kumble got runs clearly proves that there were no devils in the Bangalore wicket and that the Indian batsmen simply lacked the application to handle the young Pakistani pace attack. After this, would it be wrong to say that India has a strong batting side, but only on paper?

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? There is only one word to describe India?s batting in Bangalore ? deplorable. However, this should not take away from Pakistan?s brilliant performance. Inzamam-ul Haq and his young team not only outplayed their more fancied opponents but also displayed greater strength of character. Perhaps, the Indians need to learn a thing or two about handling pressure from their rivals across the border. The Pakistan cricketers refused to baulk under pressure even when the chips were down and reaped rich rewards in the end. This was in sharp contrast to the inept performance of the Indian batsmen who simply threw away their wickets. 

 The Indian think tank needs to do a few things for the coming one-day series. For starters, the batsmen need to pull up their socks and the batting order changed. Maybe, we can have Kumble open the innings after his good showing with the bat in Bangalore.

 Yours faithfully,

Sharmi Adhikary, Calcutta

 Sir ? That the Indian batsmen failed to save the match in Bangalore should not come as a surprise. Haven?t we seen them snatching defeat from the jaws of victory earlier too? It is a pity that India?s batsmen made heavy weather of knocking off the required runs ? they only had to score a little over four runs per over. The manner in which the Indians batted after lunch showed that they were playing for a draw, and not to win. Ultimately, they couldn?t even do that, losing the game and allowing Pakistan to square the series. One has often seen champion cricketing sides win matches which were given up as a lost cause. And here?s the Indian cricket team which regularly loses matches that few other teams would not manage to win.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Sourav Ganguly and Co. need to learn a few lessons from the Bangalore debacle. That Team India did not win a test series against a second-string Pakistan side is surely a matter of grave concern. Sourav?s boys also failed to deliver the knockout punch when it mattered. For instance, in Mohali, the Indian bowlers failed to knock down the Pakistani tailenders who saved the match for their team. Had Pakistan been in India?s position, they would have won the game and run away with the series. Also, the credit for India?s victory in Calcutta goes to the individual brilliance of Kumble and Rahul Dravid, rather than to the entire team. Finally, the less said about the Ganguly?s performance, the better. It is about time that the selectors showed Ganguly the door. After all, Yuvraj Singh and Mohammed Kaif are not getting any younger.

 Yours faithfully,

Rahul Dutt, Calcutta

 Sir ? There can be no doubts about the fact that Pakistan outplayed India in every department of the game in the last test. They bowled their hearts out to dismiss the Indian batsmen, who fell like ninepins on the final day. Earlier, the likes of Inzamam, Younis Khan and Shahid Afridi had batted India out of the game. The Pakistani skipper, who scored heavily with the bat, also led his team from the front, something which Ganguly failed to do. The test series may have ended in a draw but can there be any doubts about who the real winners were?

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Ahmed, Calcutta

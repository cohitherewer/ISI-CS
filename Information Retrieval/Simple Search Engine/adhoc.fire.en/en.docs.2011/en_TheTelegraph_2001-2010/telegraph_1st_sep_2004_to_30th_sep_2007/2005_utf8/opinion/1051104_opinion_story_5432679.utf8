 EXPERIENCE THE WORLD THROUGH WORDS

 Back to basics

Here is an acid test to check how well students and teachers utilize the library facilities in their universities. Go to the library and the subject area of your choice. You will find all the standard texts, as well as supplementary readings around the subject, enough to earn you a distinction with some help from others. Pick out a book at random and check the registration slip. The date of acquisition would be given and the extent of borrowings. You will find, in many cases, that ever since the book was acquired, the withdrawals have been virtually nil! This raises two crucial questions for the book world.

 One, does the fall in borrowings and the steep decline in the number of each book published indicate that the book is in a state of terminal decline as a cultural artifact and a conveyor of information and comment? Second, does the fall in library use, reduction in book stock signal shift in the educational world away from ?print-based? sources of information and entertainment?

 To the first question there is no pat yes/no answer. But undoubtedly, if books become less necessary, the position of authors and publishers become problematic. Publishers can change tack and print books that are part of the entertainment industry, or ones that can spin off into films or sitcoms. Where do authors go? Fall in line with the publisher and churn out the kind of books they want? 

 One point the publisher knows is that the library can no longer be taken as a firm point of sale. Budgets have been slashed, or at least not sufficient to meet the rising cost of books and library paraphernalia. While the crisis in libraries continue, books won?t disappear for the simple reason ? cost. Computers cost money and one is never sufficient for an institution. Two simple examples from present-day operations on the internet tell us that the book, in some format, will continue. 

 National Academy Press placed the entire content of their 1,700 titles on the web. The result was not a collapse in sales, but a reported increase of 17 per cent. However far technology has advanced, it has not provided a cost-effective alternative. And even if advances in technology make computers affordable, copyright owners will demand their fees. Their numbers being large, the cost of negotiating with each of them will be prohibitive. 

 But if the book will continue, the new technology, too, has come to stay. And it will spread as costs come down. The transition between print-based information and the supplementary electronic-based information reminds you of the McLuhan distinction between the medium and the message. But the preoccupation with new technology has replaced any understanding that there is such a thing as content. If there is revulsion for the book, may be readers will turn to web to learn the stuff they want. It may not be enough, but at least they will learn something and, hopefully, turn to the printed word when they realize that technology is simply ?a knack of so arranging the world without experiencing it.?

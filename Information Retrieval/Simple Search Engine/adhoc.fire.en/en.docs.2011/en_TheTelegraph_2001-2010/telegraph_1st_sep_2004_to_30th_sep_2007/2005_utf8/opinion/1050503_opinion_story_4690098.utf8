 POLITICS MINUS VALUE

 Malvika Singh

 The Congress as the leader in the UPA coalition, killing itself and its inmates by non-stop backbiting and betrayal, is encouraging the bureaucrats to run amuck and mislead as well as misgovern. From the outside it appears that the secretaries to government are using the reality of the UPA having no support from the Congress. The veiled sarcastic comments from ?leaders? of the Congress about the PM and others are scary because they show up the fundamental cracks in the single largest party, which has come back to power after many years. 

 Over the past years the bureaucracy seems to have aligned itself with another, upwardly-mobile-at-all-cost, ideology. It has no desire to implement the UPA?s manifesto promises. It does not buy the UPA?s commitment and it knows that nothing can happen without it. It is betraying the PM and the mandate that he has to deliver. Vested-interest personal agendas are where decisions are being taken. Rules are being rewritten, acts being formulated to override existing acts, acts that ?protect?, that debar destruction. One year and the cracks have become ravines, the bureaucrat is drowning any ?good practice? that remains. Integrity has been thrown to the winds in an effort to demean an upright and honest head of government. 

 One recent example of misleading the PM was the frantic lobbying by secretary to the PM to bring Gautam Goswami, much in the news over this week, into the PMO as an officer of repute. Fortunately, a non-bureaucrat saved the day by warning the PM. There are many questions that need to be answered about the bureaucrats at the helm, serious questions of intellectual probity and integrity. If the brain and the mind of decision-makers and implementers give way to insidious advice given to them by vested-interest groups and guilty individuals, to cover up some misdeed or the other, there will be total anarchy in governance. It is happening every day. Some heads must roll and we know they will not because the guilty in India get away and those with integrity who are ?in the way? get framed. That, alas, is life in India circa 2005. Honesty is no longer a respected ingredient or value. This contamination that has invaded governance is worse than any killer virus. 

 Saved by the cage

 As for saving tigers and the natural environment, the game is up. Some that will remain as poaching continues and as forests are returned to land-grabbers and real estate developers under the pretext of returning them to ?tribals?, will be seen by those of us who are around today. Future generations will see bred tigers in zoos as in the US. The hell with it. If those who govern India have no care and, worse, no understanding, then good citizenship can do so much and no more. This is exactly what the bureaucrats who destroyed our environment want. They harass till the clean individual throws his hands up in despair. That is their strategy for survival. The UPA will have presided over the brutalization of the water catchment areas of this country leading our grandchildren into disease and death. The connivance of government with vested-interest commercial and political factions has brought us to the end of the road and has killed off what Indira Gandhi intrinsically comprehended and protected. Ironically, it is her party that has dismantled her prayer.

 That same bureaucracy has also killed the manmade environment. Corrupt municipalities have been tolerated for years, reducing our cities and towns to cesspools of filth. The only beauty to behold, from a distance, is what is left of our material heritage, because when you go closer you see mutilation of the monuments that makes you sick from the pit of your stomach. The breakdown of all structures, values and commitment is frightening.

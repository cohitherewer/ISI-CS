 IN THE NAME OF HONOUR

 BEENA SARWAR

 ?The beating wasn?t as painful as the humiliation of being unclothed in front of the neighbours,? says 23-year-old Mariam (names have been changed). A few days ago, her husband Yaqub, a rickshaw driver, stripped her and beat her in the courtyard of their home in a congested Karachi neighbourhood. During that painful night, Mariam, a trained nurse, resolved to leave this man, her cousin, to whom she had been married for almost ten years, and who routinely took all her earnings. In the morning, she went to work as usual ? but taking along their children, two boys and two girls ? to the home where she has been a day-nurse for a year, caring for Salma Zaman, the well-known retired college principal.

 Seeing her condition, Mrs Zaman?s daughter Seema asked her what happened. Mariam burst into tears and told them. Meanwhile, Yaqub turned up and demanded to see her. When he was told she couldn?t come out as she was on duty, he stormed in. The principal?s son-in-law tried to make him leave but he resisted. ?So I thrashed him,? says Seema?s husband, JJ. 

 Yaqub then went to the nearest police station and tried to file a report against JJ, but the police knew Mrs Zaman?s family and phoned them. However, by evening, Mariam was in a dilemma, trapped by Yaqub lurking outside. She was also worried about her younger brother, whom the police had detained at another station. They were pressurizing Mariam to meet Yaqub as a condition for her brother?s release. It took a phone call to the police from a senior crime reporter to get her brother released.

 The next morning, the Citizens-Police Liaison Committee arranged for Mariam?s statement to be recorded at a police station, and escorted her to pick up some belongings from her house ? where Yaqub threatened to kill himself if she didn?t return. The presence of her brother and the CPLC gave Mariam the courage to walk away. She is now living at her mother?s house with the children. Yaqub has been calling her up and pleading for her to return, but this time, she?s not listening. ?I?ve had enough,? says Mariam, a matriculate; Yaqub is unlettered.

 Violent lives

 Why did she marry him? ?My father arranged it,? she says,. ?Yaqub began beating me the day after we were married. He?s very shakki...even about my own brothers...I told my family that I wouldn?t go back to him, but my father folded his hands before me...saying that we had to consider the family izzat, honour.?

 But that last beating was also the last straw. She wants a divorce and her mother and brothers support her (her father died some years ago). She says she has tried everything to salvage the marriage, even taking the case to muhallah committees and panchayats. 

 Mariam suffered all this time because of the warped logic that prevails in our part of the world, according to which family honour is sullied when a wife leaves her abusive husband, but not when she is beaten to pulp by him. This is the sick reasoning that led young Saima Sarwar?s own parents to get her shot dead in the office of her attorney. It is this mindset that condemned Zainab Noor to carry a colostomy bag for the rest of her life because of internal injuries caused by her husband.

 This is also the conditioning of our police, who would rather force a woman to go back to her abusive family than provide her with justice. And it is also this mindset that prevents the government from passing a strong law on ?honour killings? and domestic violence in Pakistan, and enforcing it. It is the women themselves who are refusing to accept this warped logic. It is fortunate that Mariam?s family now supports her. It is when there is zero tolerance of domestic violence in society that the suffering of such women will not have been in vain.

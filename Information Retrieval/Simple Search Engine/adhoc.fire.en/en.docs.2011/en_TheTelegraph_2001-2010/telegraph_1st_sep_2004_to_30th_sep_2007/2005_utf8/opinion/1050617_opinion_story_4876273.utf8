 BOOKS OR BOX?

 Between readers and TV-watchers, who are likely to imbibe more trash? This is a more up-to-date version of ?Is reading better than watching television?? or ?Is TV eating into reading time?? The National Opinion Poll in Britain has brought out the results of a survey that aims to draw up a global ?books versus TV? chart that would not only find out how the two compete with each other in 30 countries, but also how these countries rank with regard to the amount of time spent reading. Lists and polls are always suspect and have to be taken for what they are. But the results of this survey are interesting. India seems to be the most avid reader, with almost eleven hours of time spent reading per week per head. This is a little above four hours more than the global average. Britain watches most TV, more than the Continent does, and also reads less than the Continent. The American results are remarkably similar to the British ones. Only Brazil, Taiwan, Japan and Korea read less than Britain.

 There seems to be an assumption behind such a survey that reading is better for the grey cells than watching TV. This need not be true today. India has emerged the reading nation in the poll. But what if Indians spend more time reading the Page Threes of local and national dailies than, say, watching the best news channels? Would not reversing this habit give rise to a more intelligent nation? Or, take the case of books-averse Britain. Perhaps it spends more time watching BBC than the Continent does reading the local versions of Hello! magazine. Interpreters of such surveys should wake up to the fact that reading matter and television could rot the brains of readers and watchers to the same degree. There is also no reason to assume that a nation of readers is necessarily going to be a nation of classics-lovers. Mindlessness is global. A nation?s intellectual condition depends on what it chooses to watch or read, and not on whether it prefers TV or books.

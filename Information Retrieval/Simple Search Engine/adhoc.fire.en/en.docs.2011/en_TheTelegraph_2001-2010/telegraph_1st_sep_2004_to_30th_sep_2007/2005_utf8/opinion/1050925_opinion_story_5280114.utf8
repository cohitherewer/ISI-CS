 FOR ART?S SAKE AND MORE

 Shelley?s imaginary poet, singing songs ?unbidden? while obscured from the world in ?the light of thought?, was a wishful image even in his own time. With industrialization rapidly becoming far more than just a looming shadow, the self-communing artist was already having to look beyond the finer aspects of his work towards the far cruder world of publishers, buyers and the market. For a budding painter, the message of the market could mean a rude descent from the ideal. A little more than thirty years after Shelley?s wistful longing for the secluded poet who mesmerizes the world into attention, in the middle of the nineteenth century, Dante Gabriel Rossetti was painting in defiant rebellion against the ?mechanical? age. A well-disposed patron, a stockbroker with a strong Yorkshire accent, admired his Annunciation. But, he asked, ?Couldn?t you put a soonset floosh over the whole thing??

 When contemporary painters? work begins to sell, inland and abroad, at more than impressive prices, it is natural to wonder about the present status of the ?soonset floosh?. Interaction with the public often eases the relationship between artist and consumer, as has been the case with writers. It is a relationship that is anomalous at the root. The artist?s world of intellect and aspiration is defined by its difference from the concerns that drive the market. To live and grow by selling wares in the same market is an ability that has had to be acquired since Rossetti?s time. A painter has less direct interaction with the public than the writer, and could go on painting as the whim takes him if he knows his wares will not sell. With the market for Indian contemporary art warming up globally, the picture is strikingly different.

 The price paid for Tyeb Mehta?s Mahishasura at a Christie?s auction of Indian art in New York dramatically emphasizes a symptom the international art market has been showing for the last few years. Works of Mehta, M.F. Husain, F.N. Souza and many other Indian artists, both older and younger, are being presented and sold at auctions at very high prices. It is not merely a question of taste, that is, sudden focus on work that fuses Indian tradition with Western modernism. The market, like the artist, has its moods. The boom in the sale of Indian art has much to do with the improvement in the Indian economy and exposure through globalization. The prosperity of non-resident Indians, who seem to be turning to Indian art both as investment and status symbol, is a major force behind the change. The stakes are too high for the most reclusive artist to ignore. The equation between an artist?s idea of beauty, or his struggle to find his individual style, and the forces that drive the changing market is likely to become more complicated than ever.

 LEARN TO KEEP THE PEACE 

 Gwynne Dyer

 World War II ended 60 years ago when on May 6, 1945, Germany surrendered unconditionally. Japan held out for three more months before being hammered into surrendering by atomic bombs, but that was just a postscript. The real centre of the war was in Europe, where at least 30 million people were killed ? and maybe as many as 50 million, if you believe post-Soviet estimates of Russian losses in the war.

 Sixty years without a world war. We can?t be doing all that badly, then, because World War II happened only 21 years after World War I. Still, aren?t we living on borrowed time by now? When is the next one due?

 It?s the name that misleads, as if there had only been two world wars. As if they were 20th-century aberrations that we have now left far behind us. 

 World wars are a consistent feature of modern history, recurring on average about every 50 years since the 17th century. They didn?t have atomic bombs in the 17th century, or machine-guns, so the killing was much less efficient than it is nowadays. But if by ?world war? you mean a war in which all the great powers of the time got involved, in two giant alliances, and fought it out for years all over the world until one side caved in, then there have been about six of the things.

 Same pattern

 The Thirty Years War, 1618-1648 ? all the great powers involved, many millions dead, famine and cannibalism in Germany by the end. The war of the Spanish succession, 1702-1714: all the great powers involved, fighting on every continent, maybe a million dead. The Seven Years War, 1756-63: all the great powers involved, Britain gets Canada and India, probably not even a million dead. The French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars, 1792-1814: all the great powers involved, Napoleon invades Egypt and Britain, conquers Argentina (briefly) and South Africa, four million dead.

 There is a pattern here. The death toll isn?t as high as the 20th century, but the politics of the alliances looks very familiar. Some countries switch sides, but it?s the same great powers fighting in much the same places, war after war after war. Including the two that we call World War I (1914-18) and World War II (1939-45).

 The only reason we call them ?world wars? is that the technology had got better. So wars that were politically little different from the rest killed vastly larger numbers of people ? 11 million in the first ?World War?, at least 45 million in the second ? and made it seem like we were experiencing a wholly different phenomenon. Sadly, we were not.

 Undo the damage

 But there is hope. We are now 60 years into an experiment designed to change the international system and break the pattern of recurrent world wars. In 1945, the survivors of the worst war in history changed international law and made war illegal. They also created a new institution whose purpose was to oversee that law and ensure that the great powers never went to war again (for next time, it would be with nuclear weapons). They called it the United Nations.

 The UN has some eloquent enemies, but they never explain how the world can break out of this cycle of world wars without changing the international system; and that is precisely what the UN represents ? a break with the system. Its enemies promise security through military strength, and they can often deliver on their promises in the short term. But in the long run, if we don?t break the cycle, then the great powers will slide back into war again as they have so many times in the past, and next time hundreds of millions will die.

 For 60 years now, no great power has directly fought any other great power: we have made some progress. Remember the war, but concentrate on what it taught us, and on the job at hand.

 LET NEW IDEAS FLOW

 MALVIKA SINGH 

 I have never been able to comprehend why India makes the straightforward things of life, living and work so complicated. To arrange a small closed-door seminar to discuss the reality of the media in the subcontinent, to take one example, becomes a nightmarish experience as one goes about trying to get ?permission? to discuss and debate, from the ministry of home affairs! Quite unfathomable. Imagine this all-powerful ministry having to waste its time on such trivial interventions in the life of think tanks, in circa 2005, in the world?s largest functioning democracy, that is mandated to live by the freedoms enshrined in the Constitution, including the freedom of expression and thought. Why do we Indians have to be put through the humiliation identified with dictatorial regimes? Why have we become so intellectually regressive, so babu-dominated? 

 Instead of compelling discussion, debates, contrary points of view in argument, the government of India remains suspicious of all who think, question and raise fresh issues as well as possible solutions that have not been thought through earlier. Anything that contradicts government diktat is hammered to pulp and those who speak out are often damned. In a country one of whose greatest strengths is active and creative minds, this suppression is not warranted. The brain drain happened because people were not willing to be treated in a manner so disrespectful. Unfortunately, babudom is primarily responsible for the intellectual frustration that Indians have to live with in their own country. Unread, unexposed rulers and administrators do not understand the desperate need ordinary people have for a leadership of ideas. 

 India dammed

 A root cause of the anarchy we see around us stems from a profound lacuna of new ideas and therefore fresh initiatives. This makes us lag behind on the world stage. What is it with modern India that it does not allow for the conducive space to generate breakthroughs in thought? This was once a strength that India was renowned for worldwide. Today, our ?brain power? has become our only ?substantial? export item. We delight in that truth. But we just do not know how to nurture it for it to blossom forth in this subcontinent. ?Authority? drives it insane with the imposition of archaic structures, rules and norms within which to operate, and pushes it out and away. 

 All Indians who have migrated have done extremely well for themselves and for their host countries. They are seen to be honest and hardworking. Their counterparts in India are forced to be corrupt in order to keep their heads above water. They are plagued by ?inspectors? looking for bakshish, age old and redundant rules of functioning that the Imperial power had instituted for the natives and that have not been radically changed, inconsistent policies of government, and a one-step-forward-ten-steps-back reality. Our successive governments have successfully stemmed the high tide of entrepreneurship with iron curtain methodologies that have constrained India to remain poor and ?backward?. It suits the ?authority? much like it suited the foreign masters! Despite this, Indians found ways and means to work, produce, generate wealth and keep this land mass resilient. They have neither been applauded nor celebrated. 

 We are now confronted by another barrier ? a coalition government where the partner outside of the consortium, the one least accountable, is autocratic, virtually despotic, about rectifying areas that will release the work ethic of India. Open the sluice gates of dammed India, an India that is thirsting to do and deliver. The UPA should restrict its resources and its babus, to addressing and resolving the issues of roti kapda aur makaan for those below the poverty line. Lay off the rest.

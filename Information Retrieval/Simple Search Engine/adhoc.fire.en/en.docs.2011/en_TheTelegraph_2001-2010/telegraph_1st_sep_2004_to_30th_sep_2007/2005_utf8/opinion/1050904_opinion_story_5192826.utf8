 LEFT ENLIGHTENMENT

 The Buddha, the Enlightened One, spreads light all around. Any reader of the old jataka tales is familiar with this redeeming quality of the Buddha. It is somewhat apposite that a communist named fondly after the Buddha should bring enlightenment to his comrades and hope to the people of West Bengal. There are other similarities between Gautama Buddha and his Bengali namesake. Gautama, history records, abandoned his life of princely pleasure after three moments of epiphany which occurred when he saw old age, sickness and death. He renounced everything and became a seeker; having learnt, he decided to teach and to spread light. Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee began his political career as a hidebound and arrogant Stalinist. There is no record of his epiphany, but his observation of a fast-changing world and a fast-declining West Bengal brought him out of his ideological cocoon. Surprising many of his critics, he took upon himself the onerous task of bringing back capital to West Bengal, and in the process forcing his party to rethink many of its antiquated ideas and policies. Mr Bhattacharjee, the reformer, is unrecognizable from Mr Bhattacharjee the revolutionary, as much as Gautama, the prince, was unrecognizable from the Buddha, the teacher and renouncer.

 Immediately after signing the agreement with the Salim group in Indonesia, a beaming Mr Bhattacharjee had declared that this was the happiest day of his life. When his statements and policies received the stamp of approval from his party?s politburo on Friday, it must have been a very close second to the happiest day for the West Bengal chief minister. Mr Bhattacharjee has always been a very loyal member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), so it is unlikely that he had proceeded with reforms without a nod from the party leadership. Despite this assumption, especially for those not so au fait with the inner workings of the CPI(M), there was an obvious dissonance between the policies pursued by Mr Bhattacharjee in West Bengal and the rhetoric emanating from Gopalan Bhavan in New Delhi against the reforms being initiated by Mr Manmahon Singh?s government. This confusion has now been clarified.

 It would be an exaggeration to suggest that Mr Bhattacharjee has made karma yogis out of commisars. But he has started the process of forcing armchair theorists to accept global realities. There are still a few comrades who, in response to Mr Bhattacharjee?s call, ?reform, perform or perish?, would rather perish than change with the times. The CPI(M) will not change overnight and the old rhetoric will continue even after the policies have changed. Mr Bhattacharjee has shown that deeds are much more important and enduring than words. His contribution to West Bengal will outlive his party?s rhetoric.

 WAKE-UP CALL

 Jehanabad notwithstanding, it may be alarmist to say that the spectre of Maoism is haunting India. Maoist violence still remains an aberration in Indian politics. Even in the states where the rebels seem to wield the power to strike, democratic politics is the undisputed choice of the overwhelming majority of the people. Many rebel groups of earlier times came to accept the futility of armed insurrections against the state and joined the democratic process. But political, as well as religious fanaticism, always attracts small bands of adherents. The threat from such groups is not merely to the authority of the state and its institutions; it is also to the people?s freedoms. The state?s battle against the Maoist rebels should, therefore, be in the interest of democracy and all the freedoms it gives to the people. The forces that seek to destabilize the system must be defeated so that these freedoms are protected. It is time New Delhi woke up to the danger and got its priority right. It is no secret that the Maoist groups operating in different states of India are bound not only by ideology but also by common strategies and logistics. Their links with their comrades in Nepal and Bangladesh are also not unknown. 

 However, the time has also come to look deeper into the causes behind the spread of the Maoist rebellion. It may not do to simply lay the blame on social and economic injustices. The caste conflicts in Bihar, for instance, are the staple of the state?s politics. They cannot wholly explain the resurgence of Maoism either in Bihar or in other states. When it erupted in West Bengal in the Sixties, Maoism ? or the so-called Naxalbari movement ? had no casteist orientation to it. It is important to study the phenomenon more closely in order to draw up effective battle-plans against it. What is absolutely essential, though, is the political will to take on the rebels. The trouble is that political parties are known to exploit the Maoist threat for small partisan gains. Self-seeking politicians and bureaucrats have obviously made the rebels increasingly bolder. Jehanabad should thus be a wake-up call for not just Bihar but for the entire country. The system has the power to eliminate the menace. But all powers are useless if they are not exercised when necessary.

 AGAINST NATURE

 Proving him wrong

 Faster Than the Speed of Light: The Story of Scientific Speculation 

 By Jo?o Magueijo,

 Heinemann, ? 16.99 

 If you thought only titles like The Satanic Verses or The Da Vinci Code are eligible for a Khomeini?s or the Vatican?s fury, you are mistaken. In the supposedly staid world of science, too, can thousands of copies of a book be pulped after printing. This one, written by the Reader in Theoretical at the Imperial College, London, has undergone the same fate. And the fatwa ? in this case a legal threat ? has been from an establishment no less influential in the world of science than Islam and Christianity are elsewhere ? the journal Nature.

 Magueijo?s sins are many. In his book he has accused his fellow British physicists of academic failures, vicious rivalries and sexism. Not only do the senior officials at the Imperial College suffer from ?endemic bad leadership,? but members of the Royal Society, are also ?academically impotent.? Magueijo has described in graphic detail the extracurricular activities of students at Cambridge University, including accounts of sexual acts in a lavatory. His scorn for a colleague who stared fixedly at his girlfriend?s behind have also found place in his book.

 All this earned Faster Than ...a lot of publicity in the US when it was first published there. A few months later, when its British publisher got it ready for binding, came the threat of legal action from the authorities of Nature. They found Magueijo?s trenchant remarks against them, including his suggestion that some of them be castrated, too much to bear with. Hence the publication of this re-edited version in the UK. Anyone curious to compare it with its earlier version will doubtless find it tamer of the two, but not wholly emasculated.

 You may ignore Magueijo?s salacious comments about his peers as embellishments to hike the sale of his book. Since James Watson?s The Double Helix, it?s hardly surprising that scientists have rivalries, opinions and even personal lives. But the contempt for Nature is a serious issue ? one that?ll take you to the core of the book.

 Magueijo is an iconoclast in life as well as ideas. Having grown up in post-revolution Portugal, he was expelled from school, evicted from the army and finally spurned by his comrades for being a Trotskiite. Although his love for science was ignited in childhood by The Evolution of Physics, written by Leopold Infeld and Albert Einstein, it?s the great master that he?s out to prove wrong.

 Einstein is the biggest ever icon of science. This year is the 50th anniversary of his death as well as the 100th anniversary of his great idea that ended an era in physics ? the Special Theory of Relativity. Its lynchpin is the premise that light travels at one speed and one speed only. But Magueijo claims that the postulate is wrong, that light travelled faster in the early universe than it does today. Why? Because that explains some of the deepest cosmological mysteries before which relativity is helpless. You needn?t be an Einstein to realize that the speculation, if proved, will sweep the icon off his pedestal.

 How does Nature come into the picture? When Magueijo and one of his colleagues wanted to publish a paper in the journal, they were told that it was unacceptable because it was merely a solution to those mysteries, not the solution. The assertion, however pious it may sound, is, in effect, hollow, for science is an unending exercise in error-correction. If Nature?s yardstick is to be followed, can any paper be ever published in any journal? ?Perhaps God?s complete works will one day be accepted for publication in Nature,? writes Magueijo, ?but even that is far from certain.?

 P.S. Here?s Magueijo?s comment (against the editor of Nature who rejected their paper) which has been excised from the US edition of this book: ?We are obviously talking about a failed scientist ? envy of the penis comes to mind. It?s a sad fact that the world is full of such people: literary critics, art curators ?people who possess both considerable power and frustrated bitterness.?

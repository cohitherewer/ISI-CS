 DIARY

 Once bitten, twice shy. That?s how anyone with even a rudimentary instinct for self-preservation would behave. But then, LK Advani seems not to care very much these days. Or why would Sudheendra Kulkarni, the man who penned the Jinnah speech that first got the BJP president into trouble, still apparently continue to have a hold over him? Insiders even say that it was he who wrote Advani?s concluding speech at the Chennai national executive, in which he announced that he would demit office on December 30, but not before telling the RSS to lay off. There may be something in the rumours since the gist of Advani?s speech is very similar to what Kulkarni has been saying lately. And having fallen foul of the sangh parivar, the chhote sardar really had nothing to lose with his show of independence ? and only a world of secular approbation to gain. 

 Nothing in the sangh parivar is as it appears to be. On the face of it, LK Advani?s speech brings out in the open the differences between the RSS and the BJP. But the truth of the matter is that KS Sudarshan had been shown the draft of the speech by the high-profile Chennai-based lawyer who had been liaising with Advani. Now the question is, why didn?t the sar-sanghchalak demur then at this very public challenge to the RSS?s dominance? Or is this RSS-Advani face-off yet another instance of the obfuscatory tactics of the saffronites, wherein a storm in a tea cup is stirred up simply to stay in the headlines?

 Be that as it may, there is no doubt that LK Advani is feeling very isolated these days. AB Vajpayee?s refusal to stand up for his long-standing political mate may not have come as a surprise, but the fact that the Swarajs, the Mahajans, the Jaitleys ? leaders whom Advani could claim to have led by the hand ? too did not support him must have rankled. The man who is still BJP president cut a rather sorry figure as he left his Chennai hotel, with only Ananth Kumar and M Venkaiah Naidu for company. The only well-known face in the party who hasn?t given up on him seems to be Jaswant Singh. In fact, ever since the Jinnah controversy, Singh has become almost a daily visitor to the Advani residence. But despite his good intentions, Singh?s ?diplomatic? style is not in keeping with the rough and tumble of Indian politics. 

 But being left out of the BJP posters for the coming Bihar elections must have been the worst cut. Besides the chief ministerial candidate Nitish Kumar, the only national- level figure the party?s election material will highlight is Vajpayee (ah! life?s unkind cuts). Advani it seems has few options left. He can either do the slow fade out, or he can, perhaps, split the BJP and form a new party along with, say, George Fernandes. 

 The BJP might be bent on self-destruction, but the Congress has little reason to feel happy at the sight. Affairs in its Delhi unit are only a tad less messy. Now that Sheila Dikshit?s detractors have failed in their efforts to make a dent in her popularity by getting her to take back the power-tariff hike, they are trying other tactics. Rumour-mongers say that the Delhi chief minister might be shunted to the Rajya Sabha soon, when three seats fall vacant from the Delhi assembly. A faceless, colourless Congressman could then replace Dikshit as Delhi CM, so go the calculations. It?s all very nicely worked out, but you know what they say about all the best laid schemes of mice and men?

 She might be the most powerful woman in the nation, and also one of the busiest people around, but Sonia Gandhi hasn?t allowed all that to come in the way of what she perceives to be her duty to her friends. When Pavitra Mattoo, a close family friend died in a freak road accident in Amethi recently, the Congress president was with her family in their hour of grief, remaining with them for a full eight hours at a stretch, supervising arrangements and extending condolences. A number of her partymen put in an appearance ? Pavitra and Manoj Mattoo looked after Rahul Gandhi?s parliamentary constituency ? but they stayed for barely a few minutes. Just goes to show that the new Mrs Gandhi might have made a place for herself in Indian politics, but the iron is yet to enter her soul. 

 Vanity, thy name is man. On a recent trip to Pakistan, Kamal Nath, our jet-setting commerce minister, ran into Shahnaz Hussein, she of the flaming tresses and global herbal cosmetics empire. Since Humayun Akhtar Khan, Nath?s Pakistani counterpart, was also present, Shahnaz saw this as a wonderful opportunity to make a mark and immediately launched into a spiel about how popular her products were in Pakistan. But Akhtar wasn?t one to be taken in easily. Her products would do well in Pakistan, he suggested, if she rid them of their feminine bias. Shahnaz immediately turned to the Indian minister, saying that he could testify to the wonderful efficacy of her products, since he had benefited from them. Nath, always ready with a smart quip, was for once at a loss for words. But the minister has nothing to be ashamed of. Soaps, creams, lotions are no longer the exclusive preserve of women. If he has doubts, he has only to look at Shah Rukh Khan.

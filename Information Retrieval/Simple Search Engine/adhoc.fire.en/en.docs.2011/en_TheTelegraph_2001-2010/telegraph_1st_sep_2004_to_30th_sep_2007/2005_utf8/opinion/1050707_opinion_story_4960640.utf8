 Letters to Editor

 Stop playing by the rule

 Sir ? In ?Gentlemen amp; their game? (July 3), Dickie Rutnagar unduly chastizes Sourav Ganguly for taking off his shirt at Lord?s. But Rutnagar should realize that cricket is today a game of the masses. Today?s Irfans are not in awe of yesterday?s Pataudis. Big money has ironed out social differences and individual skills call the shot. The sledging ushered into the game by the Aussies is worse than the act of baring one?s torso. But it does not create a dent on the reputation of the world champions. Rutnagar?s comment reflects a mindset that Ganguly and his men have broken free of. When taking off one?s shirt is not a punishable offence in cricket as it has become in soccer, why is Ganguly being condemned for trying to prove a legitimate point to his opponents? Ganguly has done Indian cricket a lot of good by ridding it of the inferiority complex that continues to afflict people like Rutnagar.

 Yours faithfully,

 Myth-making

 Sir ? Ashok Mitra completely ignores recorded history in the last paragraph of an otherwise readable article, ?Marooned in their myths? (June 27). While Lord Curzon was no doubt the author of the 1905 partition of Bengal, it is not correct to say that he recommended the transfer of British India?s administrative capital from Calcutta to New Delhi. In fact, available records show that he opposed this proposal tooth and nail as he did not agree with the administrative reason given ? that the capital of British India should not be at a corner of the empire. Nor did he fancy the idea of the raj moving into the seat of the old Mughal empire, which it had replaced. He felt that Calcutta was the centre of business and industry. Thus, along with representatives of British trade and industry in Calcutta, Curzon vigorously opposed the proposal to shift the capital.

 I also cannot support Mitra on the point that if the partition of 1905 was allowed to stand, there would have been no partition of either Bengal or India in 1947. There were many other historical reasons for this, the most important being the unwillingness of the Hindu bhadraloks to make up with the Muslims, their inability to take the scheduled castes along with them and political mistakes such as turning down Fazlul Huq?s offer in 1937 for a coalition between the Congress and the Krishak Praja Party. These were much more responsible for the 1947 partition than the reunion of the two Bengals in 1911.

 Yours faithfully,

Nitish Sengupta, New Delhi

 Sir ? Ashok Mitra?s love for Lord Curzon proves that the Indian communists have not changed much since the last world war when they openly supported the colonial masters and called Subhas Bose a quisling. Mitra asserts that the 1905 partition of Bengal was a step which, if not annulled, would have empowered Muslim peasants and nourished the fledgling Muslim intelligentsia. The latter would then have taken the wind out of the sails of the two-nation theory. This is a figment of Mitra?s imagination. History has proved him wrong. The birth of Bangladesh politically and culturally emancipated the Bengali Muslims. Three decades was time enough for the Muslim peasants and the intelligentsia to develop and enrich their land and culture. Can Mitra explain why Bangladesh has become a thoroughly Islamic state and why it is still ruled by fundamentalist forces inimical to India? If the partition had not been annulled, the whole of erstwhile Bengal might have been in Pakistan. In that case, Mitra would have lost his freedom to write his kind of articles.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? What is surprising in Ashok Mitra?s ?Marooned in their myths? is his tone of certainty. That the decision not to partition Bengal would be overturned later could not be foreseen. Lord Curzon?s real motives behind the partition did not remain a secret and so the protest against partition was rational. The protest met with much success and went on to strengthen the roots of the nationalist movement years after. 

 Two, the prospect of a better life for Muslims has been overrated by Mitra. No matter how much Lord Curzon wished for the progress of Muslims, he would not have dug his own grave by preparing them to become potential threats to the empire. Even in undivided Bengal, opportunities for education and a better social life were there for those Muslims who ventured beyond the madrassahs. Three, the argument that the spread of education would have toned down divisive trends based on religion cannot be accepted. Partition happened owing to many reasons. Bengal, by solely allowing the partition of 1905, could not have averted the 1947 partition. At least this can never be said with certainty. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Errata

 Sir ? Brinda Karat was said to have been ?born a Bengali? in Ashis Chakrabarti?s ?Survival strategy? (July 6). It should have read, ?born a Bengali, from her mother?s side?. The error is regretted.

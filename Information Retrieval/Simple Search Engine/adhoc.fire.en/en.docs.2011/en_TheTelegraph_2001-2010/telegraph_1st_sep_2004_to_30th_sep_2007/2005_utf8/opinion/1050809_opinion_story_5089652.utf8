 BLOCKED ROADS

 It is too far away to matter. That is how most of the North-east is viewed from New Delhi. It is difficult otherwise to explain why the Centre took so long to bring some succour to besieged Manipur. True, the political issue that provoked the Naga students to block the two national highways connecting the state to the rest of the country is not easy to resolve. It is also true that the use of force to end the blockade could have led to violence and worse political confusions. But all this still does not explain why the Centre allowed the stir to continue for almost 50 days before deciding to airlift essential commodities to the Imphal valley. Even the government of Mr Okram Ibobi Singh was no more active than the Centre in reaching out to the people. Unlike in Mumbai, the people in Imphal were not victims of a natural calamity. But their suffering was worsened by much the same kind of political confusion and administrative ineptitude. It is such insensitivity that alienates the common people from the government and the so-called national mainstream. This makes it easier for militant outfits to exploit the people?s frustration with the establishment. 

 New Delhi should now turn more seriously to the political problem. Unless this is done soon, there could be more such agitations and even backlashes against them. The blockade has shown the rift between the Nagas and the Meiteis as never before. The chief minister, Mr Singh, must bear part of the blame. Given the complexity of the territorial issue raised by the National Socialist Council of Nagalim, he should have known the impact of his decision to announce a ?state integrity day?. By doing so he played into the hands of the Naga leaders who want the Naga-dominated parts of Manipur to be ceded from the state and added to Nagaland. On the other hand, the NSCN, led by Mr Isak Chishi Swu and Mr Thuingaleng Muivah, can now cite the agitation as proof of support by Manipur?s Naga population for its demand. It is clear that the blockade has helped the NSCN(I-M)?s strategy to press its territorial point. Obviously, the Centre?s intervention in Manipur was linked to the peace talks with the NSCN(I-M). The use of force against the agitators would certainly have given the group an excuse to muddy the talks. But the Naga leaders should also ponder if it was fair to hold the Meiteis to ransom for their bargains with New Delhi.

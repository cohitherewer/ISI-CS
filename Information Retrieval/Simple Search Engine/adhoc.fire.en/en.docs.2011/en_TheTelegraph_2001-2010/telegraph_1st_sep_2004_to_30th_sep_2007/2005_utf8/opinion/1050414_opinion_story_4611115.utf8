 GENERAL LINE

 History moves, according to Marxist theory, through the resolution of contradictions. The principal contradiction facing the Communist Party of India (Marxist) is the one between the party and West Bengal. Orthodox comrades, committed to the doctrine of democratic centralism, will say that this is no contradiction, the party will always prevail. Such an answer, in terms of the contradiction, is a problematic one since, without the support of West Bengal, the entire existence and viability of the party might well be in jeopardy. Both in terms of money and mass base, it is West Bengal that makes the CPI(M) the force that it is. Yet such is the logic of communist thinking and the state of affairs within the CPI(M) that comrades sitting in Gopalan Bhavan in New Delhi determine what line they should adopt in West Bengal where the CPI(M) runs a government. It is clear from the decisions taken in the just-concluded party congress of the CPI(M) that its central leadership has taken steps to rein in the enthusiasm of the chief minister of West Bengal in the wooing of capital.

 The party has accepted, at long last, that the processes of liberalization and globalization are irreversible aspects of contemporary reality. But this acceptance is not unqualified. Chief ministers like Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee can now woo and welcome Indian capitalists, but the old suspicions about foreign capital have all been revived and reinforced. Foreign capital is the agent of imperialism, and therefore foreign capital can only be welcomed when it comes without any conditions. Foreign investors, according to this doctrine, are expected to behave like charitable institutions and not expect any returns on their money. This is guaranteed to discourage foreign capitalists from investing. If Mr Bhattacharjee accepts this line, then West Bengal can expect the opposite of an industrial renaissance, which is Mr Bhattacharjee?s dream. There are other signs that Mr Bhattacharjee?s wings are in the process of being clipped. Witness the induction of Mr Chittabrata Mazumdar, an arch enemy of liberalization and a militant trade unionist, into the politburo. Witness also the growing critique within the party leadership of federalist tendencies and a reassertion of the power of the party headquarters over state units. Both are directed at Mr Bhattacharjee and West Bengal.

 The principal oddity of the CPI(M) is the fact that it is a communist party in a democratic polity. It presents the bizarre spectacle of being run by people who have never contested an election, and yet they dictate to elected representatives of the people. This is an untenable situation. It is unfortunate that the future of West Bengal will be determined by Mr Bhattacharjee?s success in combating a taming process imposed on him by the party leadership.

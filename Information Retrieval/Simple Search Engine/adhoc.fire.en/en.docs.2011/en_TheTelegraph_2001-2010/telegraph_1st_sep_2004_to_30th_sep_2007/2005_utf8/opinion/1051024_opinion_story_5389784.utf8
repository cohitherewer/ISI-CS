 PLAN FOR A SAFER NATION

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the government of India?s status report on Disaster Management in India, August 2004

 Mitigation measures on individual structures can be achieved by design standards, building codes and performance specifications. Building codes, critical front-line defence for achieving stronger engineered structures need to be drawn in accordance with the vulnerability of the area and implemented through appropriate techno-legal measures. Mitigation measures need to be considered in land use and site planning activities. Constructions in hazardous areas like flood plains or steep soft slopes are more vulnerable to disasters. Necessary mitigation measures need to be built into the design and costing of development projects.

 Insurance is a potentially important mitigation measure in disaster-prone areas as it brings quality in the infrastructure and consciousness and a culture of safety by its insistence on following building codes, norms, guidelines, quality materials in construction and so on. 

 For addressing natural calamities...there already exist a number of plan schemes under which a lot ...can be done. State governments need to make full use of the existing...schemes and give priority to implementation of such schemes that will help in overcoming the conditions created by the calamity. In some cases this implies possible diversion of the funds from other schemes to those schemes the implementation of which will help meeting the situation. The Planning Commission will aim at responding quickly to the needs of the Central ministries/departments/states in matters relating to the plan for meeting situations arising out of natural disasters, by enabling adjustment of schemes to meet the requirements as far as possible... 

 However, each state needs to build a team, skilled personnel, make provision for specialized equipment, efficient communication network, and relevant, intelligent and easily accessible database. There is also a need to consider creation of a plan scheme in each state ...to meet the minimum requirements for strengthening communications and emergency control rooms, thereby improving coordination and response to disasters...

 With regard to major disasters, it is...necessary for disaster mitigation components to be built into all development projects. In order to save larger outlays on reconstruction and rehabilitation subsequently, a mechanism would need to be worked out for allowing components that specifically help projects coming up in highly disaster prone areas withstand the impact of natural disasters...

 The message for the Tenth Plan is that in order to move towards safer national development, development projects should be sensitive towards disaster mitigation. With the kind of economic losses and developmental setbacks that the country has been suffering year after year, it makes good economic sense to spend a little extra today in a planned way on steps and components that can help in prevention and mitigation of disasters, than be forced to spend many multiples more later on restoration and rehabilitation.

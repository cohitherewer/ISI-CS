 LONDON CALLING PARIS

 What the Olympic committee gave to London, terrorists tried to take away. But London has a tradition of standing up to and coping with violence. This is perhaps where it is so remarkably different from Paris, its only rival in the world as a great metropolis, and more recently as the loser in the race to host the Olympic games in 2012. Except for the students? protests in 1968, the French capital has not been the site of any large-scale violence in the 20th century. It escaped Hitler?s juggernaut by declaring itself an open city once the German troops entered France in the first phase of World War II. London has never been invaded after 1066, but the Blitz during the Second World War was worse than any invasion. Parts of London were completely devastated. But life in London never stopped. If, as the old saying goes, Paris is a city that never sleeps, then London is a city where life never stops. Thursday?s dastardly attack only underlined the resoluteness of the people of London and of the city itself.

 London has grown in an unplanned manner. Thus parts of the city have their own histories. This is part of its charm. The city of London ? or the Square Mile as it is called ? is only a small part of the metropolis. To this was added areas like the city of Westminster, boroughs south of the River Thames and the various squares endowed mostly by aristocratic benefactors. Paris, on the other hand, has had its planned phase when the heart of the city, with its long tree-lined avenues and pretty shopping arcades, came to be laid out in the 19th century with a precision harking back to the fundamental premises of the Enlightenment.

 Both London and Paris are cultural centres. But the cultures associated with the two cities are different and are emblematic of their character. Paris is a city of painters: one links it almost instinctively with the Louvre, the Jeu de Pomme and the bohemian artists. Today?s bohemian in Paris is often tomorrow?s Matisse. Paris is avant garde ? in fashion, in art, in politics. Paris is liberty, always on the barricades with a flag as Delacroix painted her. London is a city of writers ? its most memorable descriptions are in Dickens, in Lamb and even in Conan Doyle. Its moment in the sun as a city of the avant garde was won by the Bloomsbury group known for its high intellectualism rather than for its art. The contrast is significant. When revolutionary crowds have marched on the streets of Paris ? 1789,1848, 1968 ? London has remained cautious, if not anti-revolution. Yet, London has been the home of revolutionaries in exile.

 The French and the British have been at loggerheads ever since William the Conqueror landed near Dover in 1066. The contest between Paris and London thus has a long and very distinguished heritage. They vie with each other to be the centre of the world which treats them, with every good reason, as Europe?s two best cities where more people choose to be down and out than anywhere else.

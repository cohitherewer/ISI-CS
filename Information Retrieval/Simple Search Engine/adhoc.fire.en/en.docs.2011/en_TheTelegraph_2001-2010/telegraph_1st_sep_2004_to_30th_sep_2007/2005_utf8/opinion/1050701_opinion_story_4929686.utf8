 Letters to Editor

 The insider 

 Sir ? ?Outsider? Indivar Kamtekar?s ?Aizawl Notebook? (June 27) affords a peep into the mainstream ?Indian? mindset. Kamtekar?s discomfiture is understandable. But the irksome ?inner line permit? may be removed only when the historical disadvantages faced by the local inhabitants wane. The author need not force his concept of ?Indianness? down our throat. Whose fault is it if he fails to find the female-bashing, cow-worshipping type of north Indians in some nook and cranny of the country? The northeasterns have the right to be Indians even without saris and turbans. Strangely, Kamtekar has not noted the absence of beggars in Aizawl. It is sad that most mainstream ?Indian? ambassadors to the North-east, when they go back to Delhi, portray it as something of an exotic relic. Why cannot the North-east be simply accepted the way it is ?

 Yours faithfully,

Kamrul Haque, Lanka, Assam

 Labour pains

 Sir ? Some of the comments made by left luminaries on the total shutdown of West Bengal on June 27 were interesting. The leader of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions, Shyamal Chakrabarty, said that people were suffering for 364 days, hence a little extra suffering on one day made no difference. So Chakrabarty does agree that the people of West Bengal have been suffering under left misrule for 29 years? Subhas Chakraborty stated that the suffering of the public during the bandh was akin to ?labour pains?. If the CPI(M) is still having labour pains after 29 years, when is it going to deliver? The glee with which Biman Bose expressed his joy at the success of the ?spontaneous? strike and Jyoti Basu promised similar action in the future showed that they get a kind of sadistic pleasure at the suffering of the public. Perhaps that is why the CPI(M) resorts to large-scale rigging during elections to remain in power. One can only pity Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. With friends and associates like these, who would need enemies? 

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Sponsoring yet another bandh in the guise of a transport strike to protest the hike in fuel prices on the one hand, and asking the Centre for more funds for Bengal on the other ? our communists have proved yet again that what they say have little resemblance to what they do (?Buddha pushes, Calcutta struck?, June 28). Of late, the Left Front government in Bengal has been making noises about ?developing? Calcutta. But the tardy pace of executing projects ? the Park Street flyover was delayed by almost a year and finances for the much-hyped east-west corridor are yet to be worked out a year after it was announced ? are proof that the Bengal communists do not really care for development. All they want is to cling to power by fooling the people with one promise or the other. The only ones to be taken in by Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s new buzzword, ?do it now?, is the floating population of professionals who have no emotional roots in Bengal. The left?s huge victory in the Salt Lake municipality proves the success of this sinister strategy.

 Yours faithfully,

Subir Sil, Shanghai

 Sir ? Subhas Chakraborty advised people to go to office on foot on Monday. Did he follow his own advise, or did he draw his pay and allowances without going to office that day? 

 Yours faithfully,

A.K. Das, Calcutta

 Sir ? Recently, when the National Democratic Alliance boycotted parliament, politicians of all parties had said that the legislature was the proper forum to discuss issues of public importance. Why then does the left resort to coercive measures like bandhs and strikes to impose its will on the masses who have already elected their representative to parliament? Is not disrupting normal life as bad, if not worse, as disrupting parliament?

 Yours faithfully,

Sunil V. Khaitan, Calcutta

 Sir ? Of the ten non-Congress states, it is only West Bengal that came to a standstill on June 27? with the complete backing of the government which is trying to sell itself as a progressive one. It is unfortunate to see the Left Front, which has considerable influence at the Centre, fall back on bandhs to vent its impotent rage. 

 Yours faithfully,

Subhajit Sengupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? The chief minister has spoken about the fuel price hike hurting the common man. Then why does he not amend schedule-IV of the West Bengal Sales Tax Act, 1994 and reduce the sales tax from 25 per cent, in order to absorb some of the increase in fuel prices?

 Yours faithfully,

Rabindra Singh, Calcutta

 Sir ? I fail to understand why The Telegraph made such an issue of Monday?s transport strike. Why blame the Left Front? Isn?t it time we realized that courtesy the ?people?s verdict?, the left will be around for a few more decades? And that after 25-odd years they will give us a new chief minister who will apologize for previous ?mistakes?? Also, do we need people like Apurba Jana here? And what if some sick children could not reach the hospital on time? They would have died anyway. The Telegraph would do well to look at the brighter side of things.

 Yours faithfully,

Ravi Ranganathan, Calcutta

 BE ON TIME

 It is only in India that as important an institution as the Supreme Court has to decide when results of school-leaving examinations should be announced. The court ordered all states and Union territories to declare plus-two examination results by June 10 every year. The apex court has to spend its valuable time on such a matter because various examination boards follow their own schedules. The victims of this utter lack of any coordination are the students. Many students, because of the delay in publication of results by state examination boards, are unable to apply to universities outside their state or are unable to join engineering and medical colleges even after qualifying in the joint entrance examination. Not surprisingly, the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education has the worst record in this regard. Many suspect that in West Bengal the results are delayed deliberately to force the best students to stay within the state. Even without subscribing to such conspiracy theories, it cannot be denied that West Bengal is particularly laggard in the publication of results. One reason for this delay is the number of people who actually take the examination. The apex court, perhaps in recognition of this, has exempted West Bengal from following the deadline this year. It will be interesting to see how West Bengal meets the deadline in the future.

 The Supreme Court?s concern about the future of students and the abuses within the examination system is indeed laudable. But what provides cause for a different kind of concern is the fact that the Supreme Court has to step in to correct what are really lapses on the part of the executive. In recent times, there have been many instances when the judiciary has had to step beyond its jurisdiction to pronounce on matters which are strictly not its business. There can be very little debate about the real business of the judiciary. The courts should be concerned with transgressions of the law of the land and punish those who have broken the law. But the judiciary, for no fault of its own, has been forced to adopt a wider function. It has to intervene, again and again, to keep institutions operational. It is incomprehensible why examination boards cannot ignore their vested interests and devote themselves to the best interests of school-leaving students. It is a pity that the Supreme Court has to intervene to ensure such a simple thing.

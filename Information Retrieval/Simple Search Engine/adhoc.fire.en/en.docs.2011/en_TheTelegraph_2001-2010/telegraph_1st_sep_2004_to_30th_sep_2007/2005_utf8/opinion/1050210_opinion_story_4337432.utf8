 Legislating for women 

 Sir ? Janaki Nair is very right in arguing that it would be wrong to depend on the state to impose ?progressive? laws for women (?Doing it their way?, Feb 9). The recent Allahabad high court judgment on maintenance is typical of several judgments over the years, where Muslim men have been asked to do something because Hindu men already do it. At the same time, it is not possible to ignore the state and the judicial process entirely. Personal laws are created by the state, and amendments too will have to be passed by the state. So even attempts from within the community come up against the state. If we argue that because there is a politically-charged situation notions of gender justice should not be raised, then it means handing over secular citizenship concepts to the Hindu right. What then will be the positions of women who try to identify themselves without reference to community? 

 Yours faithfully,

Soma Marik, Calcutta

 History of mistrust

 Sir ? As a frequent traveller to Bangladesh, I found Sunanda K. Datta-Ray?s ?Pipeline to trust? (Jan 30) out of sync with ground realities. The ethos of Bangladeshi society has slowly but surely changed from rabid Bangla nationalism to Islamic fundamentalism in the decades since its independence in 1971. A few short-sighted foreign policies, along with trade malpractices by some of our exporters in collusion with Bangladeshi officials, have also fanned the anti-India feelings. But the role of Ziaur Rahman, the husband of the present prime minister, who courted sidelined fundamentalist political formations in order to build opposition to the secular lobby led by Mujibur Rahman?s Awami League, cannot be denied. Mujib, in a display of na?ve magnanimity, forgave those who had a hand in the massacre of civilians which followed the crackdown by West Pakistani forces in 1971. After they were back, these collaborators bided their time, did away with Mujib and, finding an ally in Zia, consolidated their position. Naturally, the Islamic fundamentalists, who are all anti-India, are back under Khaleda Zia. The Harkat-Ul-Jehad-e-Islami, the Islamic Oikya Jote and, lately, al Qaida cells, have been responsible for the attacks on Bengali new-year celebrations, the attempt on Hasina Wajed ?s life, and the recent murder of Shamsul Kibria. This lobby is extremely strong in the bureaucracy, the army, and the police. 

 In short, there is not much basis for Datta-Ray?s contention that, ?On the whole, Bangladeshis are well disposed to this country?.

 Yours faithfully,

Susenjit Guha, Calcutta

 Sir ? Three points need to be pointed out, vis-?-vis Sunanda K. Datta-Ray?s article. 

 One, BIMSTEC is old news ? the new formation, with increased membership, is the Bay of Bengal Community Initiative for Multi-Sectoral, Technical and Economic Cooperation. Two, contrary to his belief, Bangladesh fuels north-east India?s insurgency and several top leaders of the terrorist groups have been given sanctuary by Dhaka. And three, our own politicians are responsible for encouraging illegal immigration since Partition, as this has provided them with a captive vote-bank.

 Yours faithfully,

J.K. Dutt, Calcutta

 Tinsel dreams 

 Sir ? Sony Entertainment Television?s Indian Idol 

is an interesting musical contest where the viewers get to decide who the winner 

will be. But are they qualified to judge? The jury on the show ? Sonu Nigam, Anu 

Malik and Farah Khan ? have said, again and again, that they are disappointed 

by the choice of the viewers. As a regular viewer of this programme, it breaks 

my heart to see really deserving singers leave the stage while the less deserving 

ones stay on, owing to the erratic and irrational public voting. 

As in our political democracy, music-lovers have ignored the merit of the contestants and have been influenced by unimportant considerations. 

 Yours faithfully,

Omar Luther King, New Delhi

 Sir ? Indian Idol is Sony?s attempt to give budding singers a chance to showcase their talents. Hence, it is very unfair when one wrong decision disqualifies them. And this is what has happened with the elimination of Vishal Kothari and Rahul Saxena. Both deserved to be allowed to proceed further. Sony should not have let the public judge the participants. This contest is to choose an artist who will entertain the entire country, but not everyone understands music. Hence, only expert musicians should be allowed to select the Indian Idol. Vishal and Rahul were superb and just because they are out of the competition, they are not losers. 

 Yours faithfully,

Ria Chakraborty, Calcutta

 Sir ? Letting the people decide is the drawback of Indian Idol, especially because one can cast as many votes as one likes. Is not the jury of the programme competent to select the winner? No wonder, the programme is losing much of its initial charm.

 Yours faithfully,

Sujit Kumar Sen Gupta, Manirampore

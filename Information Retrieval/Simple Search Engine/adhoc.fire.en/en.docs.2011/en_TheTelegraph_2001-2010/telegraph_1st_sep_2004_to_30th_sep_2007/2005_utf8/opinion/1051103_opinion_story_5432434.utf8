 SERVICE WITH A SMILE 

 - Growth by export of services requires widespread education

 Driving force 

 The Indian economy has exhibited 

 a spectacular 8.1 per cent rate of growth in the first quarter 

 of the current fiscal. The growth figure is exciting by 

 itself, but if one considers the mammoth size of the nation, 

 one is likely to be doubly impressed, for economic growth 

 in a vastly heterogeneous and huge country like India is 

 substantially harder to accomplish than in small island 

 states like Hong Kong or Taiwan. The only comparable competitor 

 seems to be the People?s Republic of China, which is still 

 racing ahead at a distinctly higher rate of growth than 

 India. But if the current tempo can be maintained, there 

 is hope that we shall catch up with the Chinese at some 

 not-so-distant future.

 Quite a few are finding a special 

 comfort in the fact that the recent upsurge in growth is 

 largely due to an expansion of the manufacturing sector. 

 Indeed, the 8.1 per cent overall growth has been made possible 

 by an 11 per cent growth in manufacturing. This is a clear 

 departure from the recent trend of services playing the 

 lead role in the process of economic growth. Many people, 

 including economists, think that a growth process driven 

 primarily by growth in the services sector is bound to prove 

 wobbly and unsustainable.

 To them, a country has to develop 

 a solid manufacturing base before it can embark on a sustained 

 growth path. 

 History lends ample support to 

 this view. Most countries, which are now categorized as 

 developed, had made their early breakthrough by inventing 

 cheaper ways of producing mass consumption goods and selling 

 them to the world market. The pattern is as much discernible 

 in the development episode of the United Kingdom, the first 

 industrialized nation, as in that of Japan, east Asia or 

 the latest down the line, China. In most cases, the cheap 

 mass consumption good which gave an early impetus to growth 

 happened to be textiles. But then, with the passage of time, 

 the comparative advantage had gradually shifted from textiles 

 to light engineering, from light engineering to cheaper 

 electronic goods and from electronic goods to automobiles 

 or even computers.

 But for the very recent upsurge 

 in manufacturing, which may well be a temporary aberration 

 from the general trend, India has not been following the 

 beaten track. The rise in the rate of growth in the post-liberalization 

 era can be attributed more to a spectacular expansion of 

 the services sector than to anything else. How should we 

 interpret this phenomenon? Should we get apprehensive because 

 the economy is trying to expand itself without a firm manufacturing 

 base? Or should we interpret it as a new model of development 

 where it is feasible to jump directly from the primary to 

 the tertiary sector, paying not too much attention to the 

 secondary sector? Of course, agrarian opulence alone is 

 generally not enough to sustain the long-term prosperity 

 of a nation. Over the last couple of hundred years, living 

 standards of the average man have improved beyond recognition. 

 The real basis of this change has been technical progress 

 which has manifested itself through a spectacular growth 

 of the manufacturing sector. Technical progress had left 

 its mark not only in the improvement of the known techniques 

 of production but in the invention of newer sets of manufactured 

 commodities. Clearly, if human societies had remained agrarian, 

 the transformation of living standards, which we call progress, 

 would not have been possible. 

 This largely explains why countries 

 had to shift from the primary to the secondary sector at 

 early stages of their development. Clearly some countries, 

 particularly the ones relatively better at agricultural 

 production, could have remained agrarian on the production 

 side and yet consume advanced industrial goods by selling 

 some of their agricultural production in the world market 

 and buying manufactured items in return. With the opening 

 up of international trade, this was evidently possible. 

 But for a number of reasons it was not the best path to 

 take. For one thing, there were obvious limitations to agricultural 

 growth because of the fixed supply of land. Moreover, there 

 was a clearly discernible fall in the relative demand for 

 agricultural goods over time, especially that for foodgrain. 

 It stemmed from a basic human tendency of spending relatively 

 less on food and more on manufactures as one?s income went 

 up. Indeed, world per capita income went up all the time 

 and this was translated into a secular fall in the relative 

 demand and hence in the relative price of agricultural goods 

 as compared to manufactures. Therefore, barring a few exceptions 

 like Australia, Canada or New Zealand, where the land-man 

 ratio was unusually favourable, countries found it impossible 

 to maintain their upward journey on the ascending path of 

 development by remaining agrarian.

 But why did the countries move 

 from agriculture to manufacturing, why not from agriculture 

 to services? Services, as economic commodities, were present 

 even in primitive societies, but they started becoming increasingly 

 important with the expansion of the manufacturing sector. 

 Clerks, accountants, lawyers, bankers, commercial travellers, 

 hoteliers, wholesalers and retailers all grew in importance 

 with the spread of industrialization and urbanization. The 

 main purpose of the services network was to give support 

 to the growing manufacturing sector. But more important, 

 a service could not be separated from its provider and so 

 it could not be exported or imported without physically 

 shifting the person providing the service. In short, for 

 a long time services remained a non-traded commodity and 

 so it was not possible for a country to shift from agriculture 

 to specialize in services and export them to buy manufactures 

 from the world market. Over time, as manufacturing techniques 

 got more capital intensive, services became more and more 

 important as providers of employment, but until recently 

 they retained their unique feature of being internationally 

 non-tradable.

 Over the past few years, however, 

 the world has undergone a sea change in information technology 

 which, among other things, has made trade in services possible. 

 This has opened up the scope for a new model of development. 

 It is now indeed feasible to sell services to the rest of 

 the world and buy manufactures in return. Clearly, services 

 are different from foodgrain. Their production is not dependent 

 on any fixed factor like land. There is no evidence of any 

 secular fall in the relative prices of services either. 

 On the contrary, the demand for services seems to be growing 

 faster than that for manufactures as is clear from the quick 

 expansion of business process outsourcing activities. So 

 for a country like India, which has a huge supply of skilled 

 labour and technical personnel, what is the harm in shifting 

 labour directly from agriculture to services, skipping the 

 intermediate stage of exporting manufactures?

 The development experience of 

 Kerala suggests that a services-dependent growth strategy 

 is indeed viable. Kerala, which tops the list of the major 

 Indian states in terms of per capita consumption, has achieved 

 very little growth of the industrial sector. Evidently, 

 a large part of the state?s affluence is attributable to 

 services, to remittances made by non-resident natives of 

 the state from all over the globe. Why cannot the country 

 replicate on a larger scale the Keralite model? In fact, 

 the main difficulty in replicating the Keralite experience 

 is that the rest of the country does not have an evenly-spread-out 

 educated and skilled population like Kerala. Now, in order 

 to make a services-dependent growth path sustainable, the 

 majority of the people must participate in the growth process. 

 But to participate in a services sector-led growth process 

 it is necessary that a person has sufficient education or 

 skill. While this necessary condition is satisfied for a 

 large chunk of people in Kerala, unfortunately it is not 

 so for the rest of the country.

 The conclusion, therefore, is 

 straightforward. If India hopes to develop and follow a 

 new model of development based on directly exportable services, 

 it has to educate its people. If that looks like a daunting 

 job, the only alternative left is to develop an exportable 

 manufacturing sector which can compete in the world market.

 ONE HALF OF THE RED SKY

 Neha Sahay

 Where in the world would you expect to find a rule which says that women applying for a job must have symmetrical breasts? Not in the US where breasts are flaunted from every billboard, not in Thailand where women contribute to the national economy by being used as sex objects, but here, in the Communist Party-ruled People?s Republic of China. This rule has not been laid down by the entertainment industry, or by any breast-implant clinic, but by a provincial government! That too by the government of Hunan province, where Chairman Mao was born.

 The rule was scrapped after it became common knowledge ? the resultant uproar worked even in this dictatorship though, typically, the uproar made no headlines. That was in March 2004. It?s only now that a draft has been circulated of a law which would ?promote employment? and deal with discrimination on the basis of sex, age or permanent residence.

 But even before this draft was prepared, women had started winning cases alleging discrimination. The most significant victory was of seven women in Sichuan who went to court against their compulsory retirement by a government-owned air compression plant which was closing down. The women had not yet reached the retirement age of 55. In such cases, workers have to be given two options: either they retire with full retirement benefits; or, they take a lump-sum to enable them to find a new job. In this plant, male workers below the retirement age had been given both options, but not the women. After the Plant Arbitration Committee ruled against the women?s plea, they went to court. The court upheld their contention.

 Unequal world

 This was in June. Last month, a 55-year-old bank employee in Henan sued her bank, challenging the retirement age itself as discriminatory: it?s 60 for men. She was both healthy and competent, she claimed, while her daughter, a law postgraduate from Sichuan University who will represent her mother before the arbitration committee, alleged that her mother?s forced retirement violated the constitutional guarantee of equal rights for men and women.

 These battles have been fought by women who grew up in the Mao era, who were brought up to think that they held up half the sky. For 30 long years, Chinese labour laws ensured maximum participation of women in the workforce, with generous amounts of paid maternity leave, cr?ches, even with community kitchens at places. These laws still exist, but only in government enterprises, which are now either being shut down or sold off. The new private owners prefer to employ men, because ?it is not convenient for women to go into business, females cannot do physical work, and females are likely to get married and have children in the immediate future?? (reasons quoted in a survey of employment prospects of university graduates).

 For women in China, the much-hyped economic ?reforms? have spelt regression. Layoffs are an integral part of such ?reforms??, and women are the first to be laid off, for the reasons quoted above. In 1990, 25 years after Mao?s death, the effects of his ideology were still evident: women earned about 80 per cent of what men did. A decade later, their earnings had dropped to 70 per cent.

 Perhaps the worst form of discrimination comes from the official women?s organization, a wing of the Communist Party. Agitation is not on its agenda. It documents the declining work conditions of female workers, and engages in ?constructive? work, including training laid off female labour for re-employment ? as housemaids for upper class Chinese. With their Westernized uniforms, pretty pink aprons and sweet smiles, these women are all set to conquer new frontiers abroad ? replace the ubiquitous Filipino maid.

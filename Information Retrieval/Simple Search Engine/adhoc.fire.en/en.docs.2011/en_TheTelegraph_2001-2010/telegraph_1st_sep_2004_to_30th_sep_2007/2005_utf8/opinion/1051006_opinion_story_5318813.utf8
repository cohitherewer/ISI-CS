 Letters to Editor

 Small fry

 Sir ? It is painful to see children suffer at the hands of cunning politicians seeking cheap publicity. Seventy school children fell sick after they were forced to wait for hours in the scorching heat, without food or water, for Samajwadi Party MPs, Amar Singh and Jayaprada on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti (?Fried, in the name of the father?, Oct 3). The chief minister of Orissa, Naveen Patnaik, has banned the deplorable practice of making school children welcome dignitaries in his state. But incidents like the one in Kanpur show that the practice continues in other states of the country. Children being made to wait outside the airport or along the road on which a visiting dignitary is supposed to pass is a common sight. The government, along with the education department and school authorities, should make a serious note of this and initiate laws to ban this tradition.

 Yours faithfully,

Swarnali Biswas, Calcutta

 Sir ? The fact that school-going children, many of them on empty stomach, were made to wait under a blazing sun on Gandhi Jayanti reflect both the overzealousness and indifference of the organizers. In their bid to please high-profile politicians, a species notorious for their lack of punctuality, the organizers forced starving children to sing and dance for the guests after half a day?s wait. The district magistrate, Deepak Kumar, deserves praise for the manner in which he defended the guilty officials by saying that they, being human, were bound to make mistakes. 

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir ?Both Amar Singh and Jayaprada are responsible for what happened to the school children in Kanpur. I am amazed to see that adults can be so cruel to children, and I can well imagine what the parents of these poor children are going through. Amar Singh said that he was late because he had other programmes to attend. What could have been so important that forced him to keep so many children waiting in the heat? Had it been a political rally, Singh would have hurried to be on time. And why did he accept more than one invitation if he could not attend them on time? Why was there no provision of refreshments for the waiting children? Were they there to take an endurance test? Surprisingly, both Singh and Jayaprada went to the hospital to ?ensure proper treatment? for the sick children but they did not take the organizers to task for not taking care of them during the event. 

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

 Sir ?The organizers of the function should be blamed for giving the students a harrowing time on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti. One cannot even imagine such a mishap occurring in developed countries. Unless stringent punishment is meted out to the guilty, similar incidents will continue to take place in our country. 

 A few politicians like Naveen Patnaik have come forward and put a stop to the practice of children being made to welcome public figures, but the Orissa chief minister is an exception. One wonders whether politicians would be able to watch their own children go through a similar ordeal. As citizens of the world?s largest democracy, the children of our country should be given the right to defy such unnecessary protocols. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bijoy Ranjan Dey, Tinsukia

 Sir? What happened to the school children in Kanpur only goes to show one thing ? school children are one of the most vulnerable sections in Indian society. It is bad enough that we come to know of the many horrors perpetrated on young students everyday, the many instances of corporal punishment being a case in point. But now, it seems that our netas have taken child abuse to another level altogether.

 Yours faithfully,

Paromita Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir ? The pavement on the Jodhpur Park-Gariahat Road south area is being broken at regular intervals to fix bamboo poles meant for fencing the footpath during the Pujas. This seems to be the norm in several parts of Calcutta during such times of revelry. If it is a statutory requirement to fence off footpaths, why are metal barriers not made mandatory? Despite all the righteous injunctions of leaving road space beside pandals, in reality, very few puja organizers seem to be paying any attention to the order. The puja committees have become a law unto themselves, flouting rules with impunity. For that matter, have the authorities done anything to stop the lopping of branches in the name of festivities? It is time they put their words into action and desist from issuing tame guidelines.

 Yours faithfully,

Rita Banerjee, Calcutta

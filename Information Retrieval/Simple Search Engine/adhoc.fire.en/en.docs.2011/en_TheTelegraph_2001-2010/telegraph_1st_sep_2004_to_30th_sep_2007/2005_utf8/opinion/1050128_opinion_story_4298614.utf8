 Paperback Pickings

 Adventures of a Sufi Madeleine

The tiger claw (Penguin, 

 Rs 450) by Shauna Singh Baldwin is inspired by 

 the extraordinary life of Noor Inayat Khan, a real-life 

 resistance agent during World War II. The daughter of a 

 Sufi mystic and nicknamed Madeleine, Noor worked against 

 the Occupation after the Nazi invasion of France. While 

 at the Sorbonne, she falls in love with Armand, a Jewish 

 pianist and composer, and when her uncle forbids the relationship, 

 she continues her romance in secret. Armand persuades Noor 

 to flee to England, where she volunteers to serve in a special 

 intelligence agency. Her story seems to end in Dachau, but 

 there are intriguing epilogues. Baldwin?s depiction of Noor 

 ?begins from fact but departs quickly into imagination, 

 bending time, creating characters around her, rearranging 

 or inventing some events to explore as if through her eyes, 

 to feel what may have been in her heart.?

Neem tree: a bouquet of short stories by Banaphool 

(Rupa, Rs 195) translated by Dipannita Datta collects some of this 

modern master?s little stories, starting with the matchless ?Neem Tree?, with 

its effortless turn from the natural to the human. The best things in this collection 

are the reproductions of Banaphool?s sketches and the chronological list of the 

originals at the end. It is prefaced by two ?recommendations? by eminent academics, 

one of which describes these pieces as ?extremely telling mini-stories?. (?Telling? 

is presumably a pun.) The translator?s note betrays her rather unsure grasp over 

basic elements of English grammar, punctuation and style ? unfortunately for Banaphool. 

There are sentences like the following: ?Using some suggestive words very skillfully 

and thereby creating proper atmosphere he concludes his stories with electrifying 

effect.? Or, ?This is what Banaphool and his exquisite style is ? well-knit and 

restrained.? 

 Vertigo (Penguin, Rs 

 295) by Ashok Banker is a reprint of a 1993 novel 

 set in Bombay. Jay Mehta is twenty-something and lives with 

 his ailing mother who has been abandoned by her husband. 

 Torn between his sense of duty towards her and his love 

 for Tuli, his demanding girlfriend, Jay struggles to make 

 a career and dreams of becoming a copywriter. But his desires 

 and ambitions are stifled by the city which nurtured them 

 in the first place.

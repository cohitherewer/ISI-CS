 BEFORE THE CANCER SPREADS

 This above all - Khushwant 

 Singh

 Protect the young

 Jawaharlal Nehru smoked a cigarette after every meal. Jinnah was a chain smoker. Winston Churchill had a cigar in his mouth most of the time. Two of the top Sikh writers I knew chain-smoked till the end of their lives. None of them suffered from cancer. However, there is no denying that consumption of tobacco in any form, raw or converted into smoke as in hookahs, chillums, pipes, is harmful to health and should be discouraged. I am all for forbidding smoking in public places like cinemas, theatres, trains, buses and offices, where smoking causes inconvenience to others. I also agree that advertising the joys of smoking by manufacturers of tobacco products should be forbidden and the sale of these products restricted to adults over eighteen years of age. Beyond that, the states must not try to meddle in peoples? liberty to consume whatever they like, knowing full well it might do them harm. Taking opium, heroin, charas, bhang and so on are perhaps more harmful than smoking tobacco. Have we been able to stamp them out?

 Imposing a ban on showing film stars smoking on cinema screens seems to be utterly silly. Teenagers don?t have to see Salman Khan smoking to think they should try it out too; they do so to appear adults or simply to assert their freedom to do what they like for the heck of it.

 Let us learn from the experience of countries like England and America. Not so long ago, every other adult, male and female was in the habit of smoking. They thus made carrying of warnings on every packet of cigarettes and advertisements in papers obligatory. It made only a marginal difference to sales. Gradually, public opinion against smoking built up. Today you hardly ever see anyone smoking. That is the sensible way to go about it ? not pass laws which we know will be ignored.

 Failing to qualify

 Ahmed Faraz?s name is familiar not only to all Urdu-knowing people round the globe, but also to millions who do not know the language but have heard Mehdi Hassan?s soulful rendering of his poem, ?Ranjish hi sahee?. Without doubt, he is the leading Urdu poet recognized as the third great after Allama Iqbal and Faiz Ahmed Faiz. You may well ask, ?So what about him?? Well, he has been thrown out of the job of chairman of the Pakistan National Book Foundation and ordered to vacate his house. Or else! He took the insult calmly and quoted his own lines:

 ?Who was waiting in the wings 

 to strike?

 Who was out in the streets?

 The winds recognize every flame 

 in our city.?

 I am not sure what exactly these lines mean; I can only guess. He is not only a household name in Pakistan and India but also an ambassador of goodwill between the two countries. He had much in common with Faiz. Both suffered imprisonment and exile for speaking out against military dictators. Both men were as loved in India as in their own country. And both men were lovers of things beautiful, notably beautiful women. In this matter, Faraz scored over Faiz. He is a tall, strapping handsome Pathan. He generously bestows compliments on women and has them eating out of his hands. One was the late Pushpa Dogra: a talented dancer. Whenever Faraz was in Delhi (which he was often) she was with him. Another is Ritu Singh of Air India in Mumbai. He described her as present-day Koh-i-Noor. How can any woman ever forget that coming from an international celebrity?

 You may well ask why did General Musharraf?s government behave in this boorish manner towards a poet regarded by the common people as the pride of Pakistan? Believe it or not, it was under the political pressure of the Muhajir migrants from Uttar Pradesh. They insisted that so important a post should be held by a man whose mother tongue is Urdu: Faraz?s mother tongues are Pushto and Punjabi, but he writes only in Urdu. By that reckoning, neither Iqbal nor Faiz were qualified for the post. How stupid can some people be!

 How not to get rich

 My short piece on problems that the wealthy have to face received attention of one of my readers ? Bharat of Ludhiana. He quotes someone as follows:

 ?Somebody once asked God, what surprises you most about mankind? God replied: ?They lose their health to make money and then lose their money to restore their health. By thinking anxiously about the future, they forget the present, so that they live neither for the present nor for the future. They live as if they will never die and die as if they had never lived.? He goes on to add:

 Man marries money

 Money marries vice,

 Vice marries misery,

 Misery marries ill health,

 Ill health marries death.

 So let us divorce money.

 What lies underneath

 Banta works as a salesman in a departmental store. One day, a lady comes and says: ?Bhai Sahib, underwear dikhana (Show me underwear).? 

 Banta; ?Sorry, aaj pehna nahin (I haven?t worn any today)?.

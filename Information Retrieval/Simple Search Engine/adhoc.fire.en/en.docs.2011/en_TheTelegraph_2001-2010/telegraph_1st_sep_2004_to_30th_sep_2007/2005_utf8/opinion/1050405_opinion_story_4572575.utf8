 UNITY IN DIVERSITY

 Despite the talk of merger, there is good reason to believe that the communists will continue to stand divided, writes Ashis Chakrabarti

 A happy ending?

 ?One must always become two, two can never become one.? This was an aphorism attributed to Mao Zedong and popularized by the pro-Beijing elements in the Communist Party of India on the eve of its split in 1964. Their slogan was, ?To split was revolutionary.? Since then, communist parties in India have split again and again ? the CPI(Marxist), born of the first split, broke into the CPI(Marxist-Leninist), and the latter into many more of the Naxalite groups. 

 Ironically, only the Maoists managed to merge again, when the People?s War and the Maoist Communist Centre merged last year to become the CPI(Maoist). Can the two mainstream communist parties do so in the foreseeable future? 

 They are not sure if they can, but, at the just-concluded 19th congress of the party, CPI leaders have once again said that the CPI and the CPI(M) should merge. The CPI(M) begins its 18th congress in New Delhi later this week and is expected to discuss the issue. But it is almost certain that the CPI(M) will turn down the CPI?s offer. At least, that is the indication given by the CPI(M) general secretary, Harkishen Singh Surjeet, in his first responses to the CPI?s suggestion. 

 But is the CPI(M) justified in refusing to even consider the proposal? Most of the issues that led to the split are either dead or irrelevant today. With the Soviet Union gone and the international communist movement mostly a theoretical matter, the pro-Moscow and pro-Beijing identities of the CPI and the CPI(M), respec-tively, no longer exist. Even the Maoists today are not enamoured of the Chinese communist party, whose ?market socialism? is anathema to them. They now swear by guerrilla groups such as the Shining Path of Peru. 

 Those who later formed the CPI(M) sounded a different note right at the time of independence, calling it ?jhoota azadi? and later doubting if a democratic, parliamentary path for the transformation of the state was possible or even desirable. Unlike the majority in the leadership of the undivided CPI, who believed in a peaceful, democratic transformation, the latter-day Marxists thought extra-parliamentary paths leading to an armed struggle would ultimately be the answer. 

 The other major issue that sparked the split in the CPI ? the so-called ?Dange letter?, which the former CPI chairman, S.A. Dange, was supposed to have written in order to secure his release from jail in return for a promise of cooperation with the British ? is also history. Little is left of the bitterness that once pitted the two parties against each other, especially in strongholds like West Bengal and Kerala. 

 But the most important issue in the split was the attitude to the Congress, the party of the ?national bourgeoisie?. Everything said, the CPI(M) was born primarily out of fierce anti-Congress-ism. The Marxists were bitter critics of the majority view in the CPI, influenced by Moscow, that the party should ally with the Congress to work for the ?national bourgeois revolution?. The Marxists saw the Congress only as the class enemy for their ?people?s democratic revolution?. It was only after the Emergency which Indira Gandhi imposed in 1975, that the CPI was forced to move away from its pro-Congress line. 

 The CPI and the CPI(M) still differ in their interpretations of the nature of the Indian state and on the current stage of the revolution in the country. They have differences on other issues as well. They still differ on doing business with the Congress. It is no secret that the CPI was even keen on joining the United Progressive Alliance government, but had to change its position under pressure from the CPI(M) and other leftist parties. 

 But for the common man, most of these differences are polemical. As far as common people are concerned, the most important thing is that both parties have long accepted the thesis of peaceful, democratic change and opposed the Maoist line of armed liberation. 

 And, most significantly, both today are allies of the Congress. So much so that the survival of the Congress-led UPA government depends on their support. In fact, the two communist parties are more supportive of the Congress than other leftist parties such as the Forward Bloc and the Revolutionary Socialist Party. 

 Leaders of the CPI and the CPI(M) try to explain this as a tactical necessity thrust on them by the compulsions of defeating the ?communal? politics of the Bharatiya Janata Party. The fact, however, is that they now follow a political line that is far removed from the CPI(M)?s uncompromising anti-Congress-ism. At the CPI congress, the veteran party leader, Satyapal Dang, called it a vindication of the original party line and asked the CPI(M) to face the reality and work for the merger of the two parties. 

 Even when the two parties now differ from the Congress ? on economic and other issues ? the voices are pretty similar. There is thus little justification for the CPI(M)?s opposition to the merger move. 

 On the other hand, the costs of the split seem to be still weighing heavily on both parties. It is all very fine to feel good about the leftists? current importance in national politics. True, the communists and other left parties notched up their best-ever tally in the Lok Sabha in the general elections in 2004. But if one were to compare the spread of the communists? influence in the earlier decades to their present areas of influence, the reality cannot be very reassuring for them. 

 In the first two general elections in 1952 and 1957, the communists were a major force in at least a dozen states. In the current Lok Sabha, of the 61 seats that the leftists have, 35 are from West Bengal, 19 from Kerala and two from Tripura. In many states where the communists were once powerful ? Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Bihar, Orissa and Punjab, they can now win elections only at the mercy of other parties. Thus, despite their importance in national politics, the communists remain a small force in the country.

 The communists? failure has left much of their old political space to caste-based parties and to Maoist groups. As recent events have shown, the CPI(M-L) or the CPI(Maoist) are growing in states like Bihar, Orissa, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra, where the communists are now struggling to survive on their own. 

 Leaders of both the CPI and the CPI(M) have long been worried about this decline. The CPI congress ended with an emphasis on the need for rebuilding the party in the Hindi heartland. The draft political-organizational report of the CPI(M) congress says much the same. 

 One way of achieving this could be a merger of the two parties. This could at least go some way to dispel popular misconceptions about the two parties and mark a new beginning. But communist movements have been nothing if not a catalogue of splits, even when there is nothing revolutionary about them. The safe bet, therefore, is that, despite the talk of merger and unity, Indian communists will continue to stand divided.

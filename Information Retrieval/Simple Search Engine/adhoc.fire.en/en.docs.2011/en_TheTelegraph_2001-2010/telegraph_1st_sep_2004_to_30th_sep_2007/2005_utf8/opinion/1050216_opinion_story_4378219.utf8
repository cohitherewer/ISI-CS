 A WEDDING IS ANNOUNCED 

 ?Quietly pleased? would sum up the general British reaction to the engagement of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles. But does it mean they will accept her as queen? asks Charles Moore 

 Happy ending

 What is the formal reason that Camilla Parker-Bowles cannot be Queen? The answer consists in three words: Andrew Parker-Bowles. There is a lot of talk about how the Church of England will not remarry people if they played a part in the breakdown of their first marriage, and that therefore Charles and Camilla cannot be remarried in church. 

 The same talk goes on to say that the Supreme Governor of the Church of England ? which Charles, as King, will be ? cannot have his wife crowned Queen if they have not been married in church. Hence the Princess Consort idea. 

 But what gets left out is that the remarriage prohibition applies only if the first spouse is still living. Diana is dead. Andrew Parker-Bowles, however, is alive. So long as he lives, the rule remains in force. 

 A possible solution, oddly, is contained in the Bible. One evening, when walking on the roof of his house in Jerusalem, King David spotted a woman washing herself ?who was very beautiful to look upon?. He found out that she was Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah the Hittite, who was a brave soldier away fighting the children of Ammon. 

 So he sent for her, slept with her and made her pregnant. Wanting to marry her, David wrote a letter to Joab, his general, asking him to put brave Uriah in ?the forefront of the hottest battle?. This was done, and Uriah was duly killed. As a punishment, Bathsheba?s baby died, but David?s repentance was sufficient for God to allow the next baby to live. He was the future King Solomon, proverbial in his wisdom. 

 Andrew Parker-Bowles had a distinguished career in the army, where he was a brigadier and Silver Stick-in-waiting. True, he rode in the Grand National, but, so far as we know, no one tried to send him to the ranks of death. He became head of the Royal Army Veterinary Corps. Now it is too late to pack him off anywhere. 

 He has left the army, is remarried and leads a blameless life as director of various companies that make all-weather racecourses and the like. I haven?t asked him, but I am sure he is ?relaxed? about the idea that his ex-wife might become Queen. No insult to the brigadier is intended when I say that I cannot believe that his continued existence on this earth will really keep the Crown from Camilla?s head.

 All of which is said just to show how flimsy, in the end, are the objections of law, Church and constitution to something with which, in reality, people are perfectly happy. Even the few strict Protestants unearthed by the television to condemn the marriage happily sing the Psalms written by the murdering adulterer David. Where there?s a will, there?s a way.

 The question is, what is the will? In most of... [the] media coverage, one could detect an uncertainty, a tendency of each paper and network to look over its shoulder at readers and viewers to try to guess what everyone else might be thinking. 

 Compared with a few years ago, the runes are hard to read. 

 In 1995, in a leading article which I think I wrote myself, this newspaper [The Daily Telegraph] said that people would not accept the Prince?s divorce if they felt it was ?a device that would allow Prince Charles to marry Mrs Parker Bowles?. In July 1997, we began to push towards acceptance of Mrs Parker-Bowles ? ?She is good for his peace of mind, and is, therefore, performing a public service?. The death of Diana at the end of the following month stopped all that in its tracks, and I remember, as editor at the time, that we received a great many letters from readers excoriating Camilla. Without feeling any animosity towards her myself, I could see that any attempt to advance her cause at that point would only retard it. Passions were aroused.

 Now all those feelings have died down, and anyone expressing burning anger at the prospective marriage of a widower and a divorc?e, both of whose marriages ended 10 years ago and both of whom are in their mid-fifties, looks slightly mad. But by the same token, very few people are thrilled, as opposed to quietly pleased, by the engagement, and many will continue to withhold approval. 

 Widespread boredom could make things easier, but could also produce sourness. Because Mrs Parker-Bowles is a sensible, down-to-earth woman, and because she loves her fianc? and he loves her, and because he needs a cure for anxiety and loneliness, I am sure the engagement is a good thing, but I am less sure that matters are now comfortably settled. In fact, the delicacy about the titles (the only Duchess of Cornwall I can think of who used it as a working title was Regan, nasty sister in King Lear) proves that they are not. 

 If you want to hold a finger to the wind, follow the behaviour of the government. Labour never likes to say anything that runs risks with focus groups, but its heart ? if it has such an organ ? is never with the monarchy. Tony Blair?s words of cabinet congratulation to the couple were verbally unexceptionable, but his body language ? bouncy, cheeky, almost satirical ? suggested contempt. 

 John Prescott, always given greater licence, said he wished the couple well and hoped that Charles would have less time for foxhunting (does he not believe that his own government?s Act will stop that anyway?). You have only to reverse the situation, and imagine Prince Charles telling Mr Prescott not to drive his two Jaguars to see that this was not a joke, but a jibe.

 It was also not a slip, but politically intended. The way it works is for a Labour politician to say something critical of monarchy or royal family, and then either let it lie, or, if things get too hot, allow Mr Blair to come gallantly to the rescue and retract it. Just before he stopped being education secretary, Charles Clarke attacked Charles for being ?out of time? in his views on schools. Number 10 duly closed the matter down, but the point had been made. 

 This week, a House of Commons committee assailed the Duchy of Cornwall?s financial managers, asking about the money spent from its profits on Mrs Parker-Bowles. Their inquiries were justified, but their tone was repellently rude and self-righteous. Their guns have now been spiked by the engagement, but they will soon start firing once again. New Labour is afraid to strike the monarchy, but more than willing to wound it. 

 Despite his carefully projected conservatism, Tony Blair has always been a constitutional radical. In his John Smith memorial lecture, delivered the year before he became prime minister, he set out his vision, rejecting anything that gave power to people ?on the basis of birth, not merit or election?. He scorned the fact that some people sat in the House of Lords ?perhaps because, 300 years ago, their ancestor was the mistress of the monarch?. 

 What does he think about someone being Princess Consort because, rather more recently, she was mistress of a Prince? Poor Camilla: uneasy lies the head that doesn?t wear the Crown.

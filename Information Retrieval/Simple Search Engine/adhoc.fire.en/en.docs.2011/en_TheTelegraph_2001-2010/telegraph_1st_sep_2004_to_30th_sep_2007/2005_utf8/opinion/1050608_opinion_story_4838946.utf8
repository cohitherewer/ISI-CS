 Competent authorities shall:

 (i) communicate with the National IHR focal point on public health measures taken pursuant to these regulations... 

 Disinsection, deratting, disinfection, decontamination and other sanitary procedures shall be carried out so as to avoid injury and as far as possible discomfort to persons, or damage to the environment.... 

 A State Party may require for public health purposes, on arrival or departure... 

 (i) information concerning the traveller?s destination so that the traveller may be contacted; 

 (ii) information concerning the traveller?s itinerary to ascertain if there was any travel in or near an affected area or possible contacts with infection or contamination prior to arrival, as well as review of the traveller?s health documents...

 (iii) a non-invasive medical examination....

 3. No medical examination, vaccination, prophylaxis or health measure... shall be carried out on travellers without their prior express informed consent or that of their parents or guardians...and in accordance with the law and international obligations of the State Party.

 Letters to Editor

 The ugly Americans

 Sir ? During the coverage of relief in the quake-stricken areas in the subcontinent, it was disgusting to see how the CNN focussed its cameras lovingly on American flags attached to boxes of relief supplies being unloaded in Pakistan. It is bad enough that opportunities for propaganda are created out of such a tragedy. Those who try to exploit it to the hilt must also have utter contempt for the basic intelligence of those who are supposed to be swayed by it. One is reminded of the racist patronization of Cold War books such as Eugene Burdick?s The Ugly American.

 Yours faithfully,

Biswapriya Purkayastha, Shillong 

 Knowledge is power

 Sir ? The Right to Information Act will go a long way to reassure the common people. The simplest way to get information to the public is to have a website devoted exclusively for the purpose, which will provide the people with all the requisite information, rules and regulations, forms and formalities. All government departments? links should be made available on this website so that people can contact them or know the latest status of any file or information. Everyone should have free access to the site. Information sought by any person through e-mail must be made available, compulsorily, within the prescribed time. Otherwise, the officer must be penalized. Also websites of all government departments of public importance must be advertised from time to time through advertisements in newspapers for the benefit of the public.

Yours faithfully, 

Mahesh Kapasi, New Delhi 

 Sir ? The much-awaited information act has come into effect. But the act can be of practical use only if the public is properly educated about its provisions and requirements. Not only the government, but the media and NGOs should also feel duty-bound to launch an exhaustive media-campaign for the purpose. The directorate of advertisements and visual publicity should give a complete list of the information officers designated under the act, mentioning their addresses, telephone-numbers and e-mail IDs.

 In this context, I would like to point out my experience with the public information officer (the deputy registrar general of the Supreme Court) appointed under the act. I had approached him on October 18 for filing an application. He asked me to come next morning as the time for depositing the required fees was over. The next morning when I approached him, he refused to accept my application on the plea that his boss had instructed him to first seek directions from the Union government if the act covered the Supreme Court as well. If at all there was confusion in this regard, how a could a public information officer under the act be appointed in the Supreme Court? I have a letter from the Union ministry of personnel, public grievances and pensions, mentioning clearly that the Right to Information Act covers the Supreme Court, high courts and other lower courts as per section 2(b) of the act. Also, there should be arrangements for the deposit of application fees through postal order and government departments should provide complete details of their public information officers and see that they are available in the office during working hours.

 Yours faithfully, 

Subhash C. Agrawal, Dariba

 Sir ? Despite the public?s right to information, how can the government refuse to furnish the details of the Nanavati commission? By blocking the information, the United Progressive Alliance government has confirmed the suspicion that the Vajpayee government deployed the army in Gujarat for a ruthless pogrom. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shubhajit Chakraborty, Calcutta

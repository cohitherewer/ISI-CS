 EVIL DESIGNS 

Far from bringing Iraq closer to democracy, the elections 

were a device by which the US sought to legitimize its occupation, says Achin 

Vanaik 

 What?s there to be happy about? 

The January 30 elections in Iraq were held under conditions 

that would have been deemed an embarrassment anywhere else ? under emergency rule, 

with an election commission organized and controlled by the occupying power, a 

candidates? list that was secret and monitoring by international observers who 

never set foot in the country (they were in Amman). 

Yet much of the world?s media (including substantial 

sections in India) welcomed the elections as a partial or total vindication of 

the US occupation. These very sections of the media had remained silent when the 

United States of America, not long ago, had ?prepared the ground for these elections? 

by carrying out a brutal air assault on Falluja. Over 300,000 people were driven 

out of their homes in the operation and much of the city reduced to rubble ? all 

in the name of punishing ?insurgents?. 

Western governments, desperate to mend fences with 

the US, predictably hailed the elections. The Indian government (and wide sections 

of the elite), equally keen to promote a strategic relationship with the US, has 

also expressed its endorsement, even if somewhat less enthusiastically.

Aren?t the elections the first step towards establishing 

democracy in Iraq? Have not the Shias, who constitute the majority, exercised 

their legitimate authority for the first time? True, the lack of participation 

by the Sunnis is worrying, but maybe they can be brought around so that the coming 

constitution can be broadly representative and democratic? That such views should 

be expressed by India?s ?strategic community? is evidence that all too often this 

community tends to be morally ruthless and intellectually flabby, when it should 

be morally sensitive and intellectually ruthless. 

No country undertakes an invasion to help the people 

of the invaded country, whatever the justifications presented about democracy 

or human rights. The outcome of certain invasions, like that of Vietnam to overthrow 

the Pol Pot regime in Kampuchea, or Tanzania?s to overthrow Idi Amin in Uganda 

may be welcome, but the motives of the invader are always selfish. This is so 

elementary an understanding of realpolitik that one did not expect our strategic 

experts to na?vely endorse the US?s attempts to disguise its real purpose behind 

its invasion and occupation of Iraq.

The US is a colonial power out to maintain its control 

over Iraq. This must never be forgotten or condoned. Also, the US wanting to establish 

genuine democracy is an oxymoron since genuine democracy must mean genuine political 

independence for Iraq. This is the antithesis of what the US wants. The US wants 

to establish an informal global empire and must, at all costs, dominate the geo-strategically 

crucial Middle East. The stakes are huge and controlling Iraq is vital for the 

success of this project. The US is constructing the largest embassy in the world 

in Baghdad as well as 14 major bases in the country to ensure its permanent military 

presence.

One cannot evaluate these elections unless one recognizes 

this wider context. What does this imply? The attitude to elections held under 

colonial rule is not, generally, an issue of principle but of tactics. What is 

more, their form and timing are shaped by the balance of forces between the occupier 

and the occupied. The US originally did not want the elections in this form or 

at this time, but made a concession, given Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani?s popular 

support. At the same time, it continues to strive to use the elections for its 

purposes, just as others from Iyad Allawi to al-Sistani to Moktada al-Sadr to 

the Kurds seek to use them for their purposes. The only sensible way to respond 

to the implications of the elections is to disaggregate their meaning and effect 

on different players, to recognize the open-ended character of the future, and 

not to fall for the self-serving deceit of the US and its cohorts.

So what does the US want out of these elections? It 

wants to legitimize its occupation under the pretence of bringing democracy. It 

wants to divide and rule. In this respect Washington has no reason to be unhappy. 

The Kurds are with them and can act as their Trojan Horse. What used to be a distinction 

between the Shias and the Sunnis has now become a divide. The US wants to put 

in place a constitution that will ensure its own indirect control over Iraq?s 

economy and polity. This is why such a constitution should not be given legitimacy 

or credibility. The US wants to unite its Western allies by healing earlier rifts, 

in which respect it appears to have substantially succeeded for the moment. Finally, 

the US wants to set up a more or less amenable client regime. All of these aims 

and the use of the elections to further them must, of course, be exposed and opposed.

Among the occupied, different players have different 

hopes and aims. Collaborators like Allawi, whose fortunes are tied to the long-term 

preservation of US power in Iraq must be disappointed at their showing although 

they remain the US?s most reliable internal allies. Others like al-Sistani, who 

were willing to collaborate because they saw no other option, remain in a limbo. 

Al-Sistani didn?t get as much support as he wanted or hoped for. He must compromise 

with the Kurds and others, and he still does not have a strategy to ensure that 

the US eventually leaves or bring full independence to Iraq. Al-Sadr, who was 

inclined at one point to move towards armed resistance, neither opposed nor enthusiastically 

participated in the elections. He too can only wait to see how the winds of resistance 

blow. The Kurds are happier. The old dream of a unified and independent Kurdistan 

has been abandoned by their party leaders. This has left the Kurds outside Iraq 

in a lurch, while the Iraqi Kurdish elite has settled for the ?benefits? that 

come with being the US?s most reliable allies.

In short, the future is extremely uncertain. Thus, 

to see in these elections some kind of democratic breakthrough is to delude oneself. 

It will take a lot more struggle ? both armed and peaceful, primarily outside 

the routine workings of political institutions ? to shift the overall balance 

of political forces against the US, and finally to force it to leave in defeat. 

The US is the harbinger of empire not democracy. And hasn?t every empire cloaked 

itself in the mantle of some kind of ?civilizing mission??

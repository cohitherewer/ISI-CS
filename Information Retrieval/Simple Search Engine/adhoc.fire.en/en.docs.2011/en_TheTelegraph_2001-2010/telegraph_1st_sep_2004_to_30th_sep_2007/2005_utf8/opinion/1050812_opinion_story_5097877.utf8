 THE CRUSHING REALITY

 Headcrusher 

 By Garros-Evdokimov,

 Chatto amp; Windus, ? 10.99

 ?The morning comes to consciousness/ Of faint stale smells of beer/ From the sawdust-trampled street/ With all its muddy feet that press/ To early coffee-stands./ With the other masquerades/ That time resumes,/ One thinks of all the hands/ That are raising dingy shades/ In a thousand furnished rooms?.

 T.S.Eliot had written these words in 1917, while trying to describe the sordidness in society. Things have not changed much since then. Sensitive individuals continue to feel the same. The Latvian world of the 26-year-old Vadim, the protagonist of Headcrusher, is no different. Anywhere that Vadim looks, he finds designer wear-clad clones moving about in a mechanical manner. Life itself appears to be nothing more than a computer game. And the only objective in life is to eliminate the other or else you get eliminated yourself. It is a world that defies the belief that ?hope dies last?, for hope seems to have been the first thing that has died here.

 Vadim is a former journalist now employed in the PR department of the biggest Latvian bank. As a child, he was brought up to believe in his own cleverness ? ?a future Pushkin?. However, the world changed with the invasion of capitalism. The promising young talent became just another insignificant cog who could be removed without notice at any point of time. A frustrated and bored Vadim finds escape in the virtual world of the computer game ?Headcrusher?. But this virtual world becomes Vadim?s reality when the game that he was using starts using him. Vadim sets off on a killing spree and his aim is to eliminate anyone who comes in his way.

 This novel was released in Russia in 2003 and has sold over 40,000 copies. Now it seems all set to become a cult novel. Rebellion against the system, rebellion as a mode of escape, invasion of the world by a different species, the disappearance of the thin line dividing the real and the virtual; the constant switching between the first person and third person narrative ? all these have been tried out already. What is then so exclusive about this particular novel? 

 Well, it is certainly one of the few engaging novels to have come out of the former Soviet Union in a long time. Besides, a book does not need to be brilliantly innovative to be successful. What makes Headcrusher an interesting read is the fact that it is a brilliant combination of spoof, satire, wit, dark humour and violence. It is fast-paced, thrilling and lives up to the claims of the book cover ? ?Russia?s Fight Club and American Psycho rolled into one.?

 So if you are looking for a thriller which makes brilliant use of the computer language, then Headcrusher is the book to go for.

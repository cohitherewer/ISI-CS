 Paperback Pickings

 A shape distinct from others

 street 

 haunting (Penguin, 70p) by Virginia Woolf 

 is one of the slim volumes in a series brought out to 

 celebrate Penguin?s 70th birthday. In 1935, Allen Lane set 

 out to convert a nation of book-borrowers into one of book-buyers, 

 and started a ?paperback revolution? founded on a passionate 

 belief in the existence of ?a vast reading public for intelligent 

 books at a low price?. The principle behind these gobbets 

 is to whet the appetite, and this is done most exquisitely 

 by the four essays/stories in this volume. ?Street Haunting: 

 A London Adventure? is about ?the greatest pleasure of town 

 life in winter ? rambling the streets of London?, stopping 

 at a boot shop and a secondhand bookshop. This long piece 

 is followed by ?Kew Gardens?, ?The Mark on the Wall?, ?Solid 

 Objects?, ?Lappin and Lapinova? and ?The Death of the Moth?. 

 They are all, in a sense, explorations of how the life of 

 feelings and consciousness experiences the passing of time 

 and the existence of ?solid objects?: ?The shell-like covering 

 which our souls have excreted to house themselves, to make 

 for themselves a shape distinct from others, is broken, 

 and there is left of all these wrinkles and roughnesses 

 a central oyster of perceptiveness, an enormous eye.?

 twilight 

 of the bengal renaissance: r.k. dasgupta amp; his quest 

 for a world Mind (Dey?s, Rs 250) by Subrata 

 Dasgupta is an interesting historical hagiographic study 

 of an eminent Indian living scholar who, in his 90th year 

 now, appears to the author as scarcely belonging to ?this 

 age of splintered minds and fragmented knowledge?: ?Rather 

 he harks back to an older time, the age of l?uomo universale 

 ? Universal Man. There seem to be a continuity in Dasgupta?s 

 mind and mentality with the intellectual and cognitive legacy 

 of the Bengal Renaissance, tempered though it is by the 

 zeitgeist of the 20th century.?

 I?m 

 coming to take you to lunch (Ebury, ?6.60) by 

 Simon Napier-Bell is an immensely readable, intelligent 

 and entertaining book about a rollickingly gay pop-music 

 manager?s experience of arranging Wham!?s first concert 

 tour in communist China. Apart from Napier-Bell?s hilarious 

 sociosexual observations, this book provides a wonderful 

 insight into the two performers, Andrew and George: ?You 

 could be travelling with George and Andrew in a limo, or 

 a train, or a band bus; they might be in the seats behind 

 you and you would hear this endless chattering, whispering 

 and giggling. They would burst into hysterical laughter 

 and bang each other on the knees then go back to nattering 

 like monkeys. They got off on everything about each other 

 ? together, they were in a world of their own ? utterly 

 private and intensely annoying...But the strange thing about 

 their impenetrable two-man world was that as soon as they 

 were apart they were both perfectly reasonable people.? 

 Napier-Bell?s You Don?t Have to Say You Love Me has 

 been described as the ?classic hidden history of Sixties 

 pop?. 

 the 

 saratchandra omnibus, vol 1 (Penguin, Rs 595) 

 by Saratchandra Chattopadhyay collects Srikanta, 

 Devdas, Parineeta (Espoused), Palli 

 Samaj (The Village Life) and Nishkriti 

 (Deliverance), translated by Aruna Chakravarti, 

 Sreejata Guha and Malobika Chaudhuri, respectively. ?As 

 I sit down to tell my story in this fading afternoon of 

 my wandering life,? Srikanta begins, ?I am flooded 

 with memories.?

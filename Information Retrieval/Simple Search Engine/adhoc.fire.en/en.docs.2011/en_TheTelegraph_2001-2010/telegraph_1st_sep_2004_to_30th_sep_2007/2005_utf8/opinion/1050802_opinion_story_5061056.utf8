 OLD CONFLICTS

 It is not uncommon for peace talks to hit roadblocks; the challenge is not to lose the way ahead. The jolt to the truce with Naga insurgents is not entirely unexpected. That the National Socialist Council of Nagalim, led by Mr Isak Chishi Swu and Mr Thuingaleng Muivah, was upset with the progress of the talks had been known for some time. The group has now made its unhappiness known by agreeing to extend the ceasefire in Nagaland by six months only. This is a major departure from the practice followed over the past eight years, when the ceasefire was always extended by a year. But it could be wrong to see this as a negation of the peace process. Occasional strains notwithstanding, the ceasefire testified to both sides? commitment to a peaceful solution to the five-decade-old insurgency. More important, it reflected ? and fostered ? the common people?s hope of a lasting peace in Nagaland. Both the Centre and the NSCN are morally obliged to the ordinary Nagas not to betray this hope. Both sides must take the differences in their stride and work even harder to narrow them down. Stalling the peace process is not an option for either side.

 True, the NSCN?s position on the ?integration of all Naga-inhabited areas? remains the most important bone of contention. There are no easy solutions to the problem, as the areas are spread over Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh as well. None of these states will like its territory to be curtailed. In fact, the issue has sparked violent protests in Manipur and caused the latest ethnic tension between the Meiteis and the Nagas there. There is even a strong suspicion that the recent agitation by the Naga students in Manipur had been covertly supported by the NSCN. While considering the NSCN?s territorial demand, New Delhi cannot but keep in mind the possible fall-out in Manipur. It cannot be the government?s policy to buy peace in Nagaland at the cost of that in another state. At the same time, it is true that the territorial boundaries of the northeastern states have always reflected the ethnic aspirations of the people. They have changed over time and may change again. The important thing is to try and find solutions that would be acceptable to contesting communities. But, unless this happens peacefully, the territorial ambitions can throw these areas back into the old days of tribal conflicts. The Naga truce is thus crucial to the entire region.

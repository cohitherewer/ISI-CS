 BEYOND STRIFE

 Sectarian strife is always regressive. Every religion has seen the disruptive senselessness of it in the course of history, and in the present. In the case of Indian Muslims, inability to resolve intermittently violent conflicts within the community will seriously affect their bargaining power as a minority community. Religious unity, therefore, makes theological as well as pragmatic sense. This is why the recent Shia-Sunni riots in Lucknow ? leaving three persons dead and several injured ? mark a precarious moment for Muslims in India. Particularly so, since the same religious celebrations have occasioned, in Gujarat, the beginnings of public amity between communities. India has a long tradition of sectarian co-operation during Muharram, taking the rituals beyond a commemoration of Shia victimhood. This is being revived in Ahmedabad to heal the wounds in the city?s recent history.

 Conflict between Shias and Sunnis, however ancient its origins, is not inherent to the Islam as authorized by the Quran. Everywhere in the contemporary world, this conflict takes on the contours of particular and local tensions, or is fuelled by the interests and strategies of global politics. The situations in Pakistan, and further away in Iraq and Iran ? each country?s sectarian configuration being distinct ? are evidence of this. So the Muslims of Lucknow must be careful not to perceive this conflict as either universal or essential to their faith. In fact, the liberal and progressive leaders of both sects in Lucknow have repeatedly shown how Shias and Sunnis share more, at the level of faith, than they differ on finer points of scriptural interpretation and religious or clerical history. The Shia-Sunni rift within the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, in this case, is significant at one level, but may be overcome at another. Both matters of belief and of personal legislation could be negotiated through peaceful dialogue and debate. In fact, what needs to be revived is the modern tradition of tolerance, reform, conciliation, respect for human rights and Quranic scholarship embodied in the Shia and Sunni maulanas, Kalbe Sadiq and Abul Hasan Ali Nadvi, respectively. The law boards and the individuals who look towards them must not lose sight of what is essential to Islam, and of the fact that this essence cannot be in conflict with either unity or peace.

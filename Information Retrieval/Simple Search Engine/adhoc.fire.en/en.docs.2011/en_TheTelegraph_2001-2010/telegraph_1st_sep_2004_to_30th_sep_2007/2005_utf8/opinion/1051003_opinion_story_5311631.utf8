 MINOR MATTER

 In India, certain things change slowly, and certain things do not change at all. The confused situation pertaining to adoption laws has not shown any change for years, in spite of the continuing campaign for a uniformly applicable adoption law. The space given to personal law in the polity has led to a division of adoption laws. While the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act of 1956 looks after Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs, it excludes Muslims, Christians, Parsis and Sikhs from its purview. Members of these communities can only have wards, who do not have the same rights as adopted children after they are eighteen. The personal laws of these communities forbid adoption, hence the law of the country too has evaded the issue. The government has failed more than once to pass a general law on adoption, simply because the convoluted politics of vote banks successfully blocked its passage each time. 

 The Supreme Court is treading gently too. This time it has asked for the views of minority communities on adoption, before laying down guidelines for regulating it. Adoption is a delicate subject, but all institutions seem to agree that personal laws are more so. This political correctness obscures the real point of adoption. Adoption is to do with children, desolate children in desperate need of nurture and love. Their numbers are staggering. It is also about adults who wish to love and are able to give care, but who may have to stifle the most selfless and creative of their desires because of the personal laws of their communities. The deadlock over adoption is terrifying in its implications. It reveals a nation more respectful to religion and personal laws than to its own children, more loyal to laws made when society was different than to young life here and now. This blindness is part of a culture of general callousness to the value of children?s lives and a blithe ignorance of the concept of children?s rights. There is no real determination to evolve a uniformly applicable adoption bill, one that will not discriminate against orphaned youngsters brought up by families in the minority communities. All that is needed is that communities should agree to free the issue of adoption from religion. If they can do that with the same alacrity with which they explicate the demands of their respective personal laws in court and parliament, there would be no problem.

 Letters to Editor

 Some more confusion

 Sir ? Thanks to Mandira Bedi, married people will now talk about HIV/AIDS with each other (?Mandira takes guard on HIV pitch?, May 18). Just as, one assumes, schoolgirls and housewives started talking about cricket after she appeared on the commentary scene. The campaign against HIV/AIDS gets more muddled by the day. In keeping with the spirit of confusion, Bedi amp; Co will spread awareness about women getting infected by their husbands, while the new national AIDS campaign still urges people to have sex only with their ?life partners?, with no cautionary message about pre-marital blood tests and risk of infection even from a single partner. Let?s face the truth, the AIDS campaign in India will never yield results unless the one-track ABC (Abstinence, Be faithful and Condoms) formula is dumped, as it has been in South Africa, for instance, with evident signs of success.

 Yours faithfully,

 M. Mitra, Calcutta

 Poor cousins

 Sir ? What we have been hearing from leaders in The Economist, Time and other reputed Western publications, we finally hear in The Telegraph from S.L. Rao (?Power versus poverty?, May 23). Fa?ade is indeed the correct word to describe much of Indian democracy. Therefore, to compare it to ?good? authoritarian governments like those in China, and to conclude that the latter is superior to democracy per se is a little premature. What India needs is citizens? control over economic resources, that is, more private ownership of the means of production and greater accountability of elected representatives. Even our voting procedures lack the desired level of transparency. 

 However, the ?success? of authoritarian regimes like China is not as high as Rao would have us believe. As he himself says, there is ample evidence to suggest that the downtrodden do indeed care about political empowerment and civil rights. Therefore, the lack of democracy does indeed prevent the Chinese from becoming citizens ? they remain subjects. Tiananmen proved that a pro-democracy undercurrent exists in modern China. The popularity of the Falun Gong also bears testimony to this. Second, there are frequent protests from unemployed industrial workers and impoverished agricultural labourers in China, which are suppressed by the state. Thus, China is hardly the model for a non-functional democracy like India. 

 Yours faithfully,

Aruni Mukherjee, Coventry, UK

 Sir ? S.L. Rao has asked the question, ?Is democracy good for the poor?? But he seems somewhat confused. The success or failure of a system is determined by the people who hold centre-stage. But yes, the freer the economy, the better it is for the people. The same racial group, following two different systems, can produce different results. Take a look at North Korea and South Korea. South Korea?s gross domestic product is three times that of North Korea, just as West Germany?s was much higher than East Germany?s before the re-unification. One is likely to arrive at misleading conclusions if one compares two different races, say the Indians and the Chinese. Democracy has more checks and balances than the authoritarian systems. 

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Troubled bridge

 Sir ? The flyover connecting Prince Anwar Shah Road with Southern Avenue may have many uses, but it has turned the roads around Lake Gardens into extremely dangerous thoroughfares. The left flank of the flyover enters the western side of Lake Gardens via the narrow Deodar Rahman Road ? on which at least 10,000 cars, schoolbuses, trucks, rickshaws, cycles and delivery vans ply daily. At least six lanes behind Dhaka Kalibari meet D.R. Road through blind alleys, making it hazardous for pedestrians and children. The traffic lights at the junction of the flyover and D.R. Road are faulty. This, coupled with the fact that major turnings into D.R. Road are blind, has resulted in a number of major accidents in the last few months.

 It is clear that arterial roads were not planned properly when the flyover was commissioned. For the time being, traffic towards Golf Green should be made to take P.A.S. Road from the flyover, the railway crossing should be re-opened for traffic into Lake Gardens, and the narrow D.R. Road should be made to bring only one-way traffic towards the flyover.

 Yours faithfully,

Prasanta Paul Chowdhury, Banalata Sen and others, Calcutta

 Sir ? About two decades ago, a fabricated steel overbridge was erected across VIP Road, near Bidhan Shishu Udyan, mainly for children crossing the road. But over the years, neither children nor adults have made much use of the overbridge, simply because there is another much-used bridge just 100 metres north, near the Ultadanga intersection. Wouldn?t it be better, therefore, if the unused overbridge were dismantled and put up somewhere else, where it can be made better use of?

 Yours faithfully,

 Diptimoy Ghosh, Calcutta

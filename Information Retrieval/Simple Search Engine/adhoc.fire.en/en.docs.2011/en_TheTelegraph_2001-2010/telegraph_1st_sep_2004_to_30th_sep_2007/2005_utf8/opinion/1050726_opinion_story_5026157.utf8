 Brothers in arms

 Sir ? Terrorists have struck on London twice in the space of two weeks. Pervez Musharaf?s speech denouncing militant organizations was somehow not convincing (?Pervez prods Blair?, July 22). How is it that Islamic terrorists who launch attacks on India ? ostensibly fighting for the freedom of Kashmir ? and those who attack targets in the West are both jihadis? But must we raise so much hue and cry about the possibility of people of Pakistani origin planting bombs in Britain and the US when Pakistani nationals attack and blow up Indian targets almost daily? India had warned the West about Pakistan being a hotbed of terrorism. Will the Western leaders heed India?s advice now?

 Yours faithfully,

S.P. Sharma, Mumbai

 Sir ? The investigations into the London blasts have not yet produced a clear result. And yet, the verdict is out: it?s Islamic terrorism. British-born Muslims have done it. Muslim leaders, the suspects and their family members will possibly have to carry the guilt for their lifetime. All the talk of encouraging positive reforms among Muslims is actually a cover for schemes to segregate them further. Messrs Blair and Bush are trying their best to stop the truth from surfacing, but it will catch up with them sooner or later. 

 The reporting of British tabloids such as The Sun has been sectarian, to say the least. Britain is soon likely to witness the curbing of individual liberties and the free run of jingoists. And then one of the last bastions of liberalism will fall.

 Yours faithfully,

Sushant Chatterjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? Pervez Musharaf?s statement that the 7/7 bombers were born, bred and educated in Britain, which is not new to militancy and terrorism, is merely an eyewash. Musharraf?s comments are aimed at misleading the world community and at hiding the facts of Pakistan?s long-standing involvement in spreading terror around the world. The recent arrest in Pakistan of Haroon Rashid Aswat ? accused to have masterminded the London blasts, while staying in a madrasah and posing as a businessman, contradicts Musharraf?s statement. It was good to see, however, that Musharraf expressed grief over the killing of innocent people in London. But what about innocent lives lost everyday in the Kashmir valley in the hands of terrorists trained in Pakistan? 

 Yours faithfully,

Ajit Guha, Calcutta

 Sir ? The outrage expressed by the Pakistani envoy to the United Nations over the fact that all the suspected terrorist bombers involved in the London blasts of July 7 happened to be of Pakistani origin, is quite understandable (?Do not pass the buck Pak tells UK?, July 18). One can hardly expect Pakistan to calmly accept the charge that it has allowed its territory for years to be used for setting up terrorist camps and for training and then exporting militants ? first mainly to India, but now to almost all parts of the world. These camps are known to have close links with al Qaida. 

 The envoy, Munir Akram, blamed British society for failing to make the Muslim community integrate with it. But doesn?t the fault here lie more with the Pakistani Muslims than with British society? If other communities and nationals have no problems assimilating with the generally welcoming British society, it does not speak very highly of the Pakistanis? ability to mingle if they cannot do the same.

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

 A little more force

 Sir ? While it is indeed great that Calcutta?s traffic sergeants have been able to put some ?fear? in the hearts of the bus drivers ? who now think twice before stopping at important road intersections to pick up passengers ? a lot still remains to be done. Commuters must be made aware that buses will stop only at the specified bus stops and nowhere else. The traffic department can make a beginning by informing the people about this through newspaper advertisements or have traffic police manning the intersections to inculcate a good habit among commuters. The commuters must also adhere to the rules. With a little cooperation from the traffic department and the commuters, Calcutta?s roads can be a far better and safer place to travel.

 Yours faithfully,

Soumik Dey, Calcutta

 Sir ? While there is no doubt that steps must be taken to penalize corrupt elements in Calcutta?s police force, it does not take a great deal of intelligence to realize that the measures adopted in Kiev are not only unsuitable for Calcutta but are also likely to cause problems for the citizens (?Sack the cops to stem the graft?, July 21). Sacking every member of a 26,000-strong force will only throw the entire traffic system into total chaos. The authorities, instead of trying to ape their Kiev counterparts, should isolate only those with proven records of corruption and take strictest of exemplary action against them. 

 But then, will it not be too much to expect such a drastic and draconian step from the authorities, under whose protection, inaction and deliberate overlooking all the corrupt elements have flourished over the years? The sacking of a few corrupt ones will be enough to put the fear fear of god in the rest and stem the rot. But will the administration prove up to the task?

 Yours faithfully,

Biswaroop Chakraborty, Calcutta

 Fading green

 Sir ? It is sad that Bengal?s forests are shrinking along with those in the rest of India. It is said that at least a third of the total land area of a country should be covered by forests. Neither Bengal nor India has managed to reach the target. True, development is necessary, but it cannot be at the cost of stripping off forests. The fact that our cities are crossing danger levels in pollution regularly has a lot to do with the cutting down of trees. The brisk rate of deforestation will directly affect the precipitation pattern, cloud formation and change the weather of our country. A plan needs to be immediately put in place whereby anyone harming vegetation will be severely penalized.

 Yours faithfully,

Rimli Datta, Calcutta

 Sir ? If the forest cover of the country is shrinking, what about the situation in Darjeeling, which is witnessing indiscriminate felling of young saplings in the existing forest areas of Ghoom and Jorebungalow. This poses a grave threat to the ecosystem of Tiger Hill and Schencal lake. It is painful to see the forest department turn a blind eye to this.

 Yours faithfully,

Llewellyn Tripp, Queensland

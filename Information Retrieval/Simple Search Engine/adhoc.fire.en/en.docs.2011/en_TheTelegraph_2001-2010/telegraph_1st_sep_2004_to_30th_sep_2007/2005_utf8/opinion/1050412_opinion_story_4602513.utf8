 PARTY JOKES

 Reincarnations are unsettling phenomena. But the central committee of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) is quite complacent about its evocation of the Stalinist shadow. No more creative writing from the members of the party without a green signal from the parent organization. There is no actual reference to socialist realism in the CPI(M)?s diktat at this time and place so distant from the doctrine?s origin. But the principle of implementation is the same: writers are to stick to the ?larger universe? of party thinking in their creative enterprises, they should write nothing that would create a controversy within the party. More, should they attempt anything that has not been previously discussed within the holy precincts of party offices and discussion fora, they would have to take prior permission of the party. This is not new in the history of communism in West Bengal. Poets and writers have previously left the formerly undivided party, or been ostracized by it, for writings and for criticism not to the party?s liking. Yet the larger left movement had instigated an unprecedented cultural flowering in the state. What could be seen as the traces of a repressive tradition within the party structure has now been given new life and substance by a CPI(M) leadership unable to put up a credible resistance to the bogey of globalization except by wiping out independent thinking and creative excellence among its own members.

 There is a strain of insanity in the decision. The most powerful regimes have failed to dictate thought, or the shadows of the Mayakovskys, Mandelstams or Eisensteins would not have accompanied Josef Stalin?s in the CPI(M)?s new rules for thinking. In the era of globalization and the information boom, thought control is pure science fiction. The central committee?s concern is with ?purity?, and it apparently falls to the bigger siblings in the central committee to protect the discipline and honesty of the humbler members. So the strictures on creative writing accompany prohibitions concerning association with the disbursal of government money for development projects. For the good CPI(M) member, greed for a better lifestyle and the ability to think independently lead with equal allure down the primrose way to the everlasting bonfire.

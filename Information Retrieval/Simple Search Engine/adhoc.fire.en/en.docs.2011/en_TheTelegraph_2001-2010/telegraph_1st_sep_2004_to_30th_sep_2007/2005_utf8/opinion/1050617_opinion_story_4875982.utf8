 INHUMAN CARE

 Still from Blade Runner, 1982

 Never Let Me Go

 By Kazuo Ishiguro, 

 Faber, ?6.50

 It could have been a haunting love story. But in Kazuo Ishiguro?s sixth novel, love merely accentuates the strangeness and unreality of an existence that merely appears to be human, but the function of which is purely mechanical. The narrator, Kathy, thirty-one years old, driving around the country in her profession as ?carer? in an England of the Nineties that never existed, remembers her schooldays in a privileged residential institution, Hailsham, and painstakingly reconstructs her relationship with Ruth and Tommy, her closest friends. Almost from the very first line, there is something wrong. Kathy?s voice is that of an uncertain adolescent, defensive about her unusually long career as caregiver ? about to end soon at twelve years ? as well as her success in it: ?Okay, maybe I am boasting now.? She explains nothing, either about Hailsham or about her profession, which involves looking after ?donors?, childishly taking for granted that the reader inhabits the same world as she does.

 Kathy?s anachronistic na?vet?, her self-absorbed, yet prosaic, reconstruction of the past, with dates (two weeks after the talk with Tommy by the pond, four days before the tape was lost), times (at age seven or eight, soon after Miss Lucy had her outburst, just before the game of rounders), places (room 22, the pavilion, the rhubarb patch by the path round at the back of the main building), paradoxically deepen the sense of a mystery. The reader is driven by something unknown, even unimaginable, and as the revelations begin to trickle out, they confirm an almost familiar feeling that the most sinister truths are also the most credible. Ishiguro?s light, flat style disguises the reach of the irony. Like the parsimoniously distributed truths of Kathy?s life, the full effects of the irony too sink in slowly, after the event.

 Perhaps one of the earliest examples of pure irony is Kathy?s remark on the second page of the novel, when she is still defensive about the fact that she, unlike many other carers, is allowed to choose her donors. Why shouldn?t they allow her to choose, she asks, without explaining who ?they? are: ?Carers aren?t machines.? But that, it emerges, is exactly what these ?students? of Hailsham are, a kind of human machine. Kathy?s memories, flying tantalisingly back and forth, with halfway suspensions and unexpected roundings-off, at last reveal this central fact, almost casually. They are human clones, bred to grow healthily into their primes, just so that they can donate their vital organs and, if alive after that is over, bits of their bodies, to sick human beings. These human beings inhabit the ?real? world, and the unreality of Kathy?s world emanates from the fact that the humanness of her life is illusory.

 Not that Ishiguro ever spells it out. Kathy?s narration is relentlessly perfect. The banality of her tone is the real horror. Neither full-fledged science fiction nor an ethics-driven dystopia, Never Let Me Go is a deceptive and disturbing horror story, written with a feather-touch. The irony opens up a vortex of tragedies. Hailsham is different from other institutions housing these orphans of science because the women running it feel the need to give them a full, rich sensibility. They are cultured and artistic, except for Tommy, whose fits of anger seem to express, unknowingly, a rebellion against the unseen forces which have determined the course of their lives. 

 The pathetically hopeful theory that the grown-up Tommy has about the significance of the art objects and poems the children produce, the best of which are taken away by a mysterious ?Madame? for an equally mysterious ?Gallery?, is a typical example of the students? childish incomprehension of the world outside Hailsham. The ?guardians? who run Hailsham encourage the students towards self-expression, so that they can reveal their ?souls?. But it leads to nothing, as Tommy and Kathy discover. Nothing is achieved by giving these ?students? a rich sensibility, the ability to love and not merely be entrapped in sex that will ease the body but never create life, nothing is proven by their self-expression. If clones have souls, it is irrelevant. Ishiguro touches on the question and leaves it in the air, intensifying the tragedy of these beings with human souls, with no ostensible hint to what it all means: the evil of human beings who use science to create an uninterrupted supply of healthy body parts for sick ones.

 The desolate landscape of Ishiguro?s earlier novels is here charged with the sense of a different kind of alienation: a cloned being can never connect. Care centres, bus stations, filling-stops and the endless road define Kathy?s map. The rigidly determined end deprives this existence of any future. So Kathy and her friends float in a vacuum, never fully adult, with only memory to hold on to. Even this memory loses its roots, for Hailsham has closed, and Kathy keeps looking for its walls, or its pavilion, at every turn in the road. The edifice of memory that she so carefully builds is to infuse substance into her bond with Ruth and Tommy. It is this that she will never let go. Each place is imbued with fantastical meaning. Love, for example, may perhaps be recovered in Norfolk, the imagined ?lost corner? where all things lost could be found. So also the broken boat stranded in the middle of the marshes, a piquant reminder of Eliot?s Marina, which they discover on a peculiarly irrelevant expedition, seems heavy with unexplained significance.

 It is perhaps a symbol of their lives, and more, but it is a symbol the reader is invited to see. Through the minimalist prose and almost Malory Towers-like rhetoric, threatened by triteness and the triviality of pretend-science fiction, there emerges a brooding sense of the futility of ?real? human life. Ishiguro?s spareness and thriller-like structure tease the reader into inference, but the conclusions are not those of a detective novel. Kathy, Tommy and Ruth are more true to human inadequacy, evasion and self-delusion than the shadowy beings who prolong their lives with organs from cloned beings. Ishiguro?s achievement is that of a poet and a master illusionist. Kathy?s unimaginative narration, as flat as daylight, captures man?s profoundest darknesses and fears through what it leaves unsaid and unimagined.

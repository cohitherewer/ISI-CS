 BACK TO LETTERS

 Words may be the primary means of communication between human beings. But human exchanges also happen in the medium of time. And perhaps it is impatience, the urge to do things quicker, rather than just laziness, that makes youngsters prefer SMS and email to writing letters with pen and paper. Computers and mobile phones have changed the pace of human communication, and hence the pace, and nature, of human relationships. It would be wrong to see this change as purely detrimental. Romance, for instance, has become a far more intense, headlong and hazardous thing because of email and SMS, and not everybody will agree that this is a bad thing. So the concern of schools, parents, linguists and apparently even NGOs for the demise of letter-writing among young people is understandable ? but perhaps there is not much point in being too sentimental about it. The linguistic damage is another matter.

 First, SMS and email cannot be lumped together. Young people can be taught to use the two technologies for two different purposes. The former could be used for quick, functional communication, and the latter for more extensive exchanges. Both are equally instantaneous. Second, with regard to email, there is no reason why the computer should not be considered as another writing tool, like the fountain pen. Boys and girls could be taught to write proper ?letters? on email too. There is no point in turning paper and pen into fetishes. The challenge lies in teaching young people to exploit the merits of the new technology without letting it rot their brains. Being moralistic about letter-writing could be counter-productive, and provoke resistance. Good and gracious letter-writing is entirely possible on email, and coupled with the time-factor, it could really be a perfectly acceptable option without much damage to the grey cells. SMS would then be used for quicker, more mundane exchanges. Technologically regressive education, however well-intentioned, never quite works for today?s young.

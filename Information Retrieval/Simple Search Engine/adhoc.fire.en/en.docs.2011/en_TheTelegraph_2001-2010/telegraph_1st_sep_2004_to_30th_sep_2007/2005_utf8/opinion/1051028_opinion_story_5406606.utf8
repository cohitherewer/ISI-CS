 TRAVEL IN A NEW AGE

 Malvika Singh

 In India, a new entrepreneurial generation has begun to comprehend the importance of being eco-friendly. Evidence of this is seen across the many properties that have mushroomed across Rajasthan, run by local, established families who have given their homesteads and themselves a lease of life. In Europe this is normal. People restore their properties, lease them out, cook the authentic cuisine of the area with organic ingredients and give their visitors a memorable experience. This is what makes travel in our day and age exciting and anchored. Happy times prevail, as also fruitful commerce.

 In an erstwhile desolate, dry and barren landscape around the Ranthambhore area in Sawai Madhopur, green cover is now abundant. The monsoon this year was better than in previous years. Environmental balances are being gradually restored. Butterflies are back, birds abound, water bodies are full. When one compares this private initiative with the badly maintained infrastructure of government and its many agencies, it becomes apparent what is holding this great nation back. Instead of unleashing the energy that is intrinsic, babus, with their archaic minds and failed methodologies, compel Indians to waste their strengths.

 There is so much positive happening around us that needs to be nurtured and given a boost. Unfortunately, anyone who does anything that is innovative, that adds value, that is establishing and endorsing an international norm, gets cut to size by an insecure bureaucracy. Shopkeepers have upgraded their outlets, products have been streamlined, restaurants have upgraded their spaces and their food, office complexes have become spotlessly clean, everything in the private domain has been radically overhauled. Juxtapose this ?energy? with important government offices, shops and institutions.

 Scent another India

 Apart from South Block and maybe North Block, government offices smell like stale urinals. This stench has become the ?scent of India?. Nowhere in the world are you overwhelmed by this special stench that envelops you as you enter the airport, also run by government. Salespeople at government-run shops couldn?t care less; they ignore the customers, chat and drink that endless sickly-sweet tea. 

 It is sad because some of the finest skills of India are in these shops and need to be out in an active market to celebrate the real industries of India, the legacy industries. I remember how, in the Fifties and Sixties, these same state emporia did some of the pioneering work in the field of textiles and handicrafts. Two remarkable women, Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay and Pupul Jayakar, set up and put their signature and their political and administrative support behind all those men and women of India, across the rural and urban landscape, who create objects of great beauty, both ornamental and functional. Ranging from age-old weaves, temple hangings, to metal and stone work, and much else that makes this subcontinent the richest repository of human skills in the world, these arts put India on the commercial map. The women were supported by Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi and given a free hand. Babus were not allowed to interfere, question or stall what they and their teams had set out to accomplish. They were successful and years after they have passed on, their stamp remains, albeit in a rather hazy form.

 Those who replaced these wonder women have not come up to scratch and there has been no real development in recent years. We need to accelerate the process, open new markets, bring these creative and cultural industries into the mainstream of our development process. We need to keep our special identity, generate pride in our products, work shoulder to shoulder with the vibrant private sector.

 TAKEN YOUNG

 A particular form of sexual brutality has been recurring over the last few months in mofussil Bengal. The female victims are all minors, usually schoolgirls, and they have been raped, sometimes gang-raped, and some of them have then been brutally killed. The latest incident happened on the day of Saraswati puja in Malda. Rumpa Sarkar, studying in class IX, had gone out with her boyfriend, also a schoolboy, to celebrate the puja. She was later found by the railway tracks, possibly gang-raped, her wrists slashed and her head crushed under the wheels of a train. Her friend had also been violently beaten up, and is in coma now. Earlier this month, in Raiganj, two teenage boys had raped a mentally challenged 16-year-old girl and left her lying in an unconscious state. A few days later, a 14-year-old girl was raped and then hacked and strangled to death in Nadia. In December last year, in the same district, a blind 19-year-old girl was raped by two young men. And again in Nadia, a girl studying in class IV was allegedly raped by her uncle, who happened to be studying in class IX.

 These incidents combine desperate sexual frustration with extreme violence, focussed on the most vulnerable ? on children, on the blind and the mentally challenged. With the rapid urbanization of the district towns bringing about increased exposure to sexual stimuli (the internet, television, films), there is perhaps a growing disparity between what may be privately fantasized and what is socially permitted. This psychosexual aspect has a political dimension. In many of these cases, local party cadre were directly involved and were effective in by-passing the police or the panchayats to work out cash settlements through the shalishi courts. Incidentally, these are also areas where girls are married off in their early teens. Rumpa Sarkar?s parents were already looking for a groom for her, and had approved of her boyfriend. The link between conservatism, social change, deprivation and extreme sexual violence is evidently not purely a big-city phenomenon.

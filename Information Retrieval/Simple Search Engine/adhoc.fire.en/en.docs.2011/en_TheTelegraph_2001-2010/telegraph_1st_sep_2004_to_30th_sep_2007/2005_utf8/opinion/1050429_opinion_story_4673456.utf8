 SLACK SEASON

 Typically, the Reserve Bank of India?s Macroeconomic and Monetary Development Report is synchronized with the annual policy statement, or the slack season credit policy. This year, it has been brought out a day earlier and states what we already know. Real growth in gross domestic product was 6.9 per cent in 2004-05, making India one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Given unfavourable monsoons, this was higher than expected and growth was broad-based across all three sectors of agriculture, industry and services, with manufacturing exports doing well. Imported inflation, the unfavourable south-west monsoon and excess liquidity contributed to inflationary pressures, and the inflationary component owing to large capital inflows was neutralized by sterilization operations through the market stabilization scheme. 

 The RBI does not, therefore, question the inevitability of the rupee not being allowed to appreciate. Mr Y.V. Reddy?s slack season credit policy announcements believe in a real rate of GDP growth of 7 per cent and an inflation rate between 5 and 5.5 per cent. This is despite higher global oil prices. The moot question remains whether monetary policy is truly independent of fiscal policy, despite automatic monetization of government borrowing having been prevented. Every government since 1991 has talked of making the RBI autonomous, but that has never happened. The RBI applauds states for fiscal reforms and declines in deficit indicators in 2004-05, but simultaneously makes the point that the Centre has missed the targets set by the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act.

 Given higher global interest rates, there was thus the expectation of higher domestic interest rates also and the market had probably factored in a 0.25 per cent hike. But as in October 2004, the bank rate has been left unchanged at 6 per cent. The cash reserve ratio, which had been increased to 5 per cent before the policy, has also been left at that level. And as in October 2004, the reverse repo rate has been increased by 0.25 per cent to 5 per cent. It is true that there will be a mid-term review on October 25, 2005, and beginning this year, the RBI will start quarterly reviews in July and January. No particular sanctity is attached to bank rate or CRR changes twice a year and depending on inflationary trends and need for credit growth, the central bank has flexibility to announce changes as one goes along. While this is true, it is also true that Mr Reddy does not possess the flexibility. High interest rates are bad for investments and growth. However, high interest rates are bad for the government?s borrowing programme and that is what has held the RBI back. But this is just postponing the inevitable. What Mr Reddy has not done now, will have to be done in October.

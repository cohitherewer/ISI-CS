 IRON WILL

 Self-interest may drive individuals and states, but it is not always the basis for good economic sense. Apparently, Jharkhand?s chief minister, Mr Arjun Munda, has a case for keeping the state?s iron-ore reserves for its own development. Several new steel plants are expected to come up in the state. Jharkhand?s iron-ore deposits make it a favoured destination for new players in the steel industry. But other states with less or no iron-ore reserves also need new steel plants. Mr Munda has to decide how Jharkhand can benefit by sharing its natural resources with other states. It cannot be a good policy to shut one state?s doors on another. But Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s recent complaint to the prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, would suggest that Jharkhand is out to queer West Bengal?s pitch over steel. Disputes among the states over the sharing of water and other natural resources are not new to India. But the dispute between West Bengal and Jharkhand over the sharing of iron ore reflects a new challenge. As the states compete with each other to attract investments, such disputes may become more frequent and more complicated. The Centre should take the states into confidence and work out a consensus on how to tackle this issue. The idea should be to ensure that one state?s development does not happen at another?s expense. 

 Mr Munda?s argument for self-interest also throws up a major economic issue. Iron ore, like land, becomes an asset only when some value is added to it. Jharkhand, along with Orissa, always had the country?s largest iron-ore reserves. Even so, both states have been among the poorest in India. Now that the demand for steel has created new opportunities for these states, the governments in Ranchi and Bhubaneswar have to rethink on how best to convert their iron-ore reserves into a larger economic advantage. In fact, Mr Munda would do well to involve neighbouring states in a comprehensive development plan for his state. But an economic competition is rarely won through confrontation. It could be in his ? and Jharkhand?s ? interest to befriend Mr Bhattacharjee. West Bengal, Orissa and Jharkhand together can make the eastern region the hub of an industrial resurgence. Sharing resources can actually be the best way to add value to them.

 Letters to Editor

 Big let down on smallscreen

 Sir ? The Madras high court ruling, giving Doordarshan the telecast rights of the Indo-Pak series, may see the Mandi House babus raising a toast (?Pak series on DD?, Feb 25). But the ruling has dampened the spirit of cricket fans. DD is notorious for its poor service ? frequent interruptions in transmission and poor sound being constant irritants. Worse, viewers will now have to bear with insufferable commentators, K. Srikanth for example. Cricket fans deserved better, considering it hardly gets bigger than this.

 Yours faithfully,

Shashank Dasgupta, Calcutta

 New colony

 Sir? In ?Evil designs? (Feb 22), Achin Vanaik compares the United States of America to a colonial power determined to control Iraq. Has Vanaik forgotten that colonialism is now a thing of the past? There is no need for a country to colonize another for its raw materials. The open market has ensured that raw materials can be procured from anywhere in the world. 

 For instance, there is no need for Japan to invade Manchuria for iron ore to run its steel mills; it now imports iron from Australia. The same can be said of former imperial powers ? Britain, France and Portugal ? that have continued to prosper even after their colonies attained independence. Vanaik, like many others, seems to enjoy criticizing the US for no reason at all. Is it because his countrymen have failed miserably to match the success of Americans, be it in science, arts or sports?

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? The noted author, Samuel Huntington, explained the West?s superiority over the East on the grounds that the former is more united than the latter. The Arab nations have always been a divided lot, often seeking outside help to settle mutual disputes. This also explains their inability to dominate the strip of land called Israel. One cannot accuse the US of colonial designs on Iraq. For was it not the Arab nations which had pleaded for American help when a bullish Saddam Hussein had invaded Kuwait, in the first place? President George W. Bush should be praised, and not censured for liberating the Iraqi people from the hands of a dictator.

 Yours faithfully,

J.K. Dutt, Calcutta

 Sir ? The American invasion of Iraq must never be forgotten or condoned. The recently held elections are only a ruse used by the Bush administration to legitimize its occupation of Iraq. 

 Despite George W. Bush?s solemn promise of pulling out of Iraq at the earliest, it is apparent that the US is in no hurry to do so. A presence in Iraq guarantees Bush a steady supply of Iraqi oil. Not only that, it also gives him leeway to dominate proceedings in this region, which is of immense geo-strategic importance.

 Yours faithfully,

Swapan Kumar Das, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir ? In her letter, Taniya Mukherjee complains that we see too much of Amitabh Bachchan nowadays (? Too much of the same man, Feb 24). It seems that Mukherjee is unaware of the fact that television commercials featuring the legendary actor are not that frequent any more. The only one on air now is the pulse polio campaign in which Bachchan along with another Bollywood heavyweight, Shahrukh Khan, can be seen advocating the oral vaccine.

 Surely, supporting the pulse-polio campaign is much better than endorsing other products like cancer sticks and alcohol. Perhaps, Mukherjee should have thought twice before deriding the superstar.

 Yours faithfully,

Deepak Dey, Calcutta

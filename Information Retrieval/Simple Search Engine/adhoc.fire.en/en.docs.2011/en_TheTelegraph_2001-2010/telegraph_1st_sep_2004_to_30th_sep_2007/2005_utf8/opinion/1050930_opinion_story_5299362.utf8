 ABOUT SPORTING FOLLIES

 MALVIKA SINGH

 The front pages of all the mainline dailies insulted intelligent Indians by running the silly story of the row between Ganguly and Chappell for unending days as did all the lead television bulletins. The real gory truth of the games being played out was not revealed, only soundbites were printed and spoken. The press became a platform for these players in the BCCI to voice whatever they chose to. Elderly men acting like members of a college secret society. Meaningless reportage, utterly superficial. It is this kind of unnecessary coverage that makes monsters out of straightforward people. They suddenly become snooty, behaving like the world owes them a living. Finally, all that came through was that there was a ?misunderstanding? between the two. Absurd and a waste of time.

 The reason all sport in India is erratic and therefore hardly professional is that none of these ?heroes? can take any criticism. They are cocky. There is always an excuse, there is always an explanation for substandard performance and behaviour. Aspiration to excel and the acceptance of faults are not Indian characteristics. It is this trait that has compelled us to lag behind in the international scene in most spheres. Cricket is no different. Consistency is something that we do not work towards. Tukka baazi seems to be our motto. Sania Mirza should learn a lesson from all this ? she should concentrate on her game, forget about all that garbage of being a brand ambassador, because once she masters her sport she will be an ambassador for tennis which is far more substantial that being a brand ambassador for some product or the other.

 Brand India

 It amazes me how some of the ?best and the brightest? professionals sell themselves so cheap by accepting to be brand ambassadors for companies like Chanel et al. Is this the aspiration of those who have been successful in their field of work? Is this all that they want? Are they not embarrassed being puppets for some company? Are they so insecure that they need endorsement as they go about endorsing dark glasses or perfume? Is this what happens to a rootless urban society in transition? Why do Indians shun all that the rest of the world sees as India?s strengths, as what draws them to this ancient country and modern republic?

 Our chaotic cities reflect this strange new disease. People appear uneasy in their immediate environment. Behaviour patterns change in an effort to deal with an unfamiliar setting. Awkwardness prevails. Social anarchy happens. Desperately trying to ape some alien culture in living styles, clothes, eating habits and suchlike at the cost of all that is familiar, makes for discomfort and creates zombies. Think of all Americans dressed in saris, salwar kameez, kurta pyjamas and dhotis, eating with their fingers ? the US would be much like a comic show. Cross-cultural interventions are essential, influences nurture fresh thinking and absorbing ideas and philosophies from across the world are what make this planet so special. It only works positively when societies are anchored and therefore confident. That is when international cultural exchanges lead to growth and development of relationships, respect for differences, better understanding and peace. A nation insecure in its larger cultural traditions because it has alienated itself from its root cannot be strong and confident. 

 With the ?economic boom?, there should be a cultural assertion. Equal importance should be given to the three aspects that make for a greater culture ? the natural environment, manmade habitats and the material environment and the skill or legacy sector. Governments tend to ignore these critical arms of society. Some amputate them from policy initiatives. In nurturing and restoring these strengths lies the celebration of India.

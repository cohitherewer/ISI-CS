 NEW PLAY, OLD PROBLEMS

 R.G. Gadkari?s Ekach Pyala: experiments in tradition

 Kirwant 

 By Premanand Gajvee, 

 Seagull, Rs 150

 In his two-part essay, ?Marathi Drama: The Journey of a Social Consciousness?, G.P. Deshpande, the noted Marathi playwright, speculates that the theatre in Maharashtra is an outcome of a desperate attempt at self-assertion by a disempowered class after the fall of the Peshwa regime. While this can be doubted, there is no denying that Marathi theatre has traversed a long, vibrantly creative way ever since Visnudas Bhave staged Sita Swayamvar before the court of the Raja of Sangli in 1843. This, most Marathi theatre historians believe, was the first ever Marathi theatrical performance.

 Bhave was the prime mover of the sangeetnatak tradition (an indigenous form of opera) which soon came to be challenged by the Pandurang Kirloskar school of realistic prose drama. These two genres were never mutually exclusive and coalesced in varying degrees in Ram Ganesh Gadkari?s ?experimental? plays, or, later on, in the plays of Vijay Tendulkar, Ratnakar Matkari and Mahesh Elkunchwar.

 Premanand Gajvee, along with Rajeev Naik, Prashant Dalvi, Makarand Sathe, Chetan Datar et al, represents a crop of a bright, new-age Marathi playwrights. He is a sworn crusader for the Dalit cause. His Ghotbar Pani, upholding the ?one village, one waterplace? slogan of the time, was a riproaring success while Devanavari, indicting the devdasi custom, received critical acclaim. Kirwant, a one-act play (translated by M.D. Hatkanangadekar), produced by Sriram Lagoo, sent shock-waves through Hindu social ethos in the late Nineties.

 Kirwants are untouchables among Marathi Brahmins. They are called upon to perform funeral rites but, at other times, remain largely ostracized. Siddheswar, a kirwant in the play, accepts social ignominy without complaint, but his brother Vasudeo, bearing the ?all Hindus are one? slogan, rebels against the Brahminic diktat. 

 While Vasudeo becomes the b?te noire of the shastris, Siddheswar remains pitiably undecided on which side to take, losing sanity, and eventually, his life. There is no optimism, nor a promise of social change in the play, as Rewati, Siddheswar?s wife, makes their son, Madhu, take up his father?s profession despite Vasudeo?s strident protest.

 Kirwant exposes the schism within an apparently homogeneous class. It provides a critique of the notion of ?purity? which, as Romilla Thapar points out, is one of the many criteria of Hindu caste-formation. The taut, linear plot-structure packs in a lot of political punch. The dialogues (sprinkled with occasional verses) are sharp. Gajvee knows the precise dramatic moment of picking up the action and the tricks of spacing the crises. For those who accuse him of being a propagandist, he had this to say in an interview, ?For me, the more important question is not whether my plays are aesthetic... but how the lives of our people may be made more aesthetic?. Gajvee has certainly mastered the ?aesthetics? of propaganda.

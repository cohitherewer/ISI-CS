 NO SHANGRI-LA

 It could be tempting to romanticize it as the fall of the world?s last Shangri-La. It is also possible to create an idyllic picture of the magnificent king of a magic kingdom voluntarily giving away all his powers to the people. But Bhutan?s emergence into the age of democracy is no such idyll. King Jigme Singye Wangchuk is more a realist than the hero of an old-world political romance. The draft constitution that he has now announced is actually the culmination of a modernizing process he had set in motion in 1999. The constitution provides for political parties and parliamentary elections in a country that had long viewed democracy and mass politics with a mix of suspicion, contempt and even fear. 

 Although democracy was still a distant dream, the king spoke the language of a modernizer ever since his ascension in 1972. True, the language sometimes smacked of Bhutan?s Buddhist mysticism. It was the king who started a debate when he said that the kingdom should aspire for gross national happiness rather than the more mundane gross national product. It could have been ignored as a casual remark, but not in Bhutan. That is why scholars at an international conference in Thimphu last February came up with sixty-odd papers on the real import of GNH. There have been more tangible forms, though, of the closed country opening to the modern world. In 1999, the king issued the kasho or the royal edict by which he surrendered many of his powers to his council of ministers. It was also the year in which television and the internet came to Bhutan. In 2001, the king set up a committee, headed by the chief justice, to draft the constitution, which will be approved at the next session of the national assembly in July. 

 However, reforms, political or economic, are never uninterrupted dream runs. When it comes, the new age will have to grapple with the grinding poverty in which most of the Bhutanese live. It will also have to find new ways to deal with the question of ethnic minorities, especially the Nepali-speaking people. It has to settle with Nepal the issue of the Nepali-speaking Bhutanese refugees who have been living in camps within Nepal for nearly a decade. As a country that is largely dependent on foreign aid, Bhutan has to win back the confidence of the donor countries which have accused it of human rights abuses against the refugees and turned off the tap. The democratic way could help Thimphu overcome some of these problems. But there could also be new problems that come with democracy. Thimphu will not have to look far for such omens. In neighbouring Nepal, the change from absolute monarchy to parliamentary democracy has resulted in conflicts that the country has not been able to resolve in the past 15 years. But these are small prices to pay for freedom and modernity.

 SOUND EFFECT

 The festive evening in Calcutta was not an ideal light-without-sound display. But it was not, generally speaking, as noisy as last year?s. It is still not time for the pollution control board to feel that its strictures regarding sound-levels are being followed to the letter; the two years immediately after the board had laid down the rules had seen quieter Kali Pujas and Diwalis. But if things are better than they were last year, there is reason for hope. There were pockets within the city and on its outskirts, where it seemed as if the concept of sound pollution had not evolved, but the concentration of police forces in the city did help somewhat in keeping noise levels down. Among the more shocking incidents was the callous merrymaking of the employees in a city hospital. They found the hospital premises perfect for their crackers. Officials in the mobile team of the pollution control board managed to douse their joyful fires, while the special officer had to order the arrest of two employees at another hospital, where a microphone, forbidden near hospitals in normal times, was blaring throughout the day within the premises that were graced by three Kali Pujas. 

 The problem is caused not just by the fact that the city is sprawling and the inhabitants are many. The pollution control board ? and the police ? have still not been able to ensure that the louder crackers are not manufactured, or even if they are, that they are not sold. Tough and effective penalties are necessary for those found breaking the sound pollution law. Although these have been proposed, the related procedures are still rather long-winded. The police?s cooperation and alertness helped a great deal to keep noise levels under control in many areas of the city. But the heavy police presence, especially in crowded festive areas and in the main temples, was a result of the Delhi blasts. The coincidence of Kali Puja and Diwali and the closeness of Eid to both are a strong temptation for terrorist groups. Building up fear and tension would not be enough for them, they would be looking to disrupt peace and harmony. It may not be stretching the imagination to think that part of the sobriety in Calcutta came from the knowledge that violence and death could erupt anywhere, at any time. A larger part of it may have come from the memory of the terrible prelude to the festival in Delhi. The association of bloodshed and festivities is still on the surface of people?s minds.

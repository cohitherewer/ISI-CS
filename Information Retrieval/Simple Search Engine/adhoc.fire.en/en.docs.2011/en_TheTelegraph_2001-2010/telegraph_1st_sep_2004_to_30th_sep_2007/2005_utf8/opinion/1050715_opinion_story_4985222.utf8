 OFF WITH HER HEAD

 Winning is everything

 The Truth About Hillary By Edward Klein, Sentinel, $ 17.95

 Edward Klein?s new book claims to reveal, as its title boldly declares, ?The truth about Hillary?. Charting the former American first lady?s progress from primary school up to her present-day incarnation as a senator and, perhaps, would-be president, Klein delivers what purports to be a well-researched evaluation of ?the phenom? that is Hillary Clinton.

 The book has become the second bestseller on the New York Times list, but the media (allegedly silenced by the Clintons) has dismissed it out of hand. Klein, a liberal and former editor of the New York Times, claims to be free from any political agenda, but has admitted that he hopes the book will serve to hinder if not destroy Mrs Clinton?s political ascent. 

 Nor is Klein subtle in his attack: he quite openly exhibits his bias from the very first chapter, where Hillary is denounced in a series of non-sequiturs such as ?She said she was passionately in love with her husband, but many of her closest friends and aides were lesbians.? Whether or not the facts are accurate, their presentation and the bitchy tone Klein sustains throughout unintentionally give the impression that his subject has been hard done by. As many Republicans fear, Klein has so successfully and explicitly vilified Hillary Clinton that all but many readers react with something verging on sympathy. 

 Hillary?s story is an interesting one, and Klein?s book, replete with speculation on the most intimate of details, is a titillating read: Hillary?s bellicose upbringing; her, non-sexual, experiences with the famous Wellesley lesbians; her all but unconsummated marriage ? and even a controversial suggestion that Chelsea?s conception issued from a marital rape.

 But it is Hillary?s burgeoning political career which forms the focus. Klein, via a cheap form of psychoanalysis, uses her pre-White House life to explain her later behaviour as first lady and senator ? continually harking back to a set of ?life lessons? with which he imagines her parents indoctrinated the young Hillary.

 Her many metamorphoses are evidenced by the graphic descriptions of Hillary?s physiological attributes ? from her one-time unshaved armpits through to her now botoxed face ? with each physical makeover revealing a political image change.

 Klein is also determined to convince us that Hillary is a ?congenital liar? (as William Safire once called her), and more specifically that she cannot fail to have known all the gory details about Monica Lewinsky?s sexual escapades with her husband. A pertinent point to focus upon, given that Hillary?s autobiography, which has just passed the one million mark, is quite adamant in its denial of this. 

 Klein?s ample interview material, albeit often from anonymous sources, and the plethora of footnotes, betoken industrious research but show no sense of balance. And the glaring omission of an interview with Hillary herself (although the author tires to preempt criticism by citing Hillary?s well known hatred of the press) further damages its credibility.

 Klein concurs with the idea that Hillary would make ?an abysmal President?, given her earlier debacle with the health care-reform effort. This is unfair. Hillary has, as the book itself demonstrates, matured hugely in political terms since 1993, and hence proved herself to be a viable candidate for the presidency. Despite Klein?s best efforts, she wins our grudging respect, if not love, for her Duracell bunny ability to just keep on winning.

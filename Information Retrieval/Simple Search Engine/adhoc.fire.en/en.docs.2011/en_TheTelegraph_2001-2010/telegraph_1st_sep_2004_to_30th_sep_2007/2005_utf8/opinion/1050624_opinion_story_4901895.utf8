 MUTUAL GAINS

 The desirability of free trade agreements is often debated, theoretically as well as empirically. While economic gains, as opposed to strategic or political ones, may not always be a determinant of FTAs, India?s spaghetti bowl of FTAs does not seem to have had a clear cost-benefit analysis. Why have FTAs with Thailand or Singapore, if one is contemplated with the Association of South East Asian Nations? However, it can legitimately be argued that what the cabinet has cleared with Singapore is a comprehensive economic cooperation agreement, which goes beyond a conventional FTA. Conventional FTAs never include agriculture. Hence, goods components are restricted to manufactured products. Singapore has offered India zero-duty treatment. In market access terms, this is insignificant, because Singapore already has zero most-favoured-nation tariffs for almost all products. As quid pro quo, India has excluded 6,528 products on a negative list and offered duty reductions on others in three categories. For two reasons, one should not be obsessed by these. First, even if the Doha Development Agenda?s completion is uncertain, unilateral tariff reductions should lead to low Indian manufacturing tariffs by 2009. Second, the spirit of liberalization will be circumvented by imposing impossible rules of origin, value addition and changes in tariff heading requirements, other than the negative list.

 Consequently, the meat of CECA, which will be formally signed when Singapore?s prime minister visits India on June 29, will be in other components of service sector liberalization (including an air services agreement), a bilateral investment promotion agreement and a better double taxation avoidance agreement. The Indian government estimates that in the first year of CECA, foreign institutional investment inflows routed through Singapore will increase to $ 5 billion, while foreign direct investment will increase to $ 2 billion. On services, the offers of both India and Singapore are WTO-plus, with a mutual recognition agreement in some sectors; easier visa norms (with a focus, from the Indian angle, on architects, accountants and doctors); India opening up in banking, mutual funds and air services; and closer cooperation in financial services. In India?s regional agreements outside the south Asian region, greater welfare gains may well be obtained in services. Given this, CECA is a welcome change from many other FTAs.

 NO PARTY GAMES

 Confusion reigns when the government proposes and the governing party disposes. Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee knows how such confusions send out wrong signals to investors and the people alike. At home and abroad, investors have quizzed him on conflicting responses from within his party to his reformist policies. True, he has managed to win over most of the sceptics on most of his policies. Yet, there have been some discordant notes within the Communist Party of India (Marxist) that continue to puzzle both the public and the entrepreneurs. How the party?s labour wing, the Centre of Indian Trade Unions, queers the chief minister?s pitch was shown once again by the bandh last month. The party?s decision to rein in the doubters will, therefore, strengthen the chief minister?s hand. Although Mr Anil Biswas, the secretary of the CPI(M)?s Bengal unit, did not spell it out, it is obvious that the decision had much to do with the inner-party debate over the proposed investments by the Indonesian Salim group of industries. Not just lesser leaders, but at least two senior ministers of Mr Bhattacharjee?s government ? Mr Abdur Rezzak Molla and Mr Subhas Chakraborty ? had openly questioned the move to lease out large tracts of farm land to the Salim group. The dissent contrasted with the party leadership?s support for the chief minister.

 It is possible to debate whether the Leninist principle of ?democratic centralism? is a communist party?s way of stifling dissent. One may also split hairs on the relationship between democracy and discipline in a political organization. But the economic development of Bengal is not a matter of partisan rhetoric; its impact on the people?s lives has a much wider significance. Political parties are expected to debate policy issues in their conclaves and help shape the government?s agenda. It is another matter if the debates become a road block to the government?s work. The CPI(M), therefore, has to go one step further. How it disciplines and punishes errant leaders is a matter of the party. What is more important for the people is an assurance that the party will delink itself from the government. This is a fundamental issue whose relevance cannot be restricted to any particular debate. The trouble is that political parties do not look beyond the next elections. It would be wrong to expect a major change in the CPI(M)?s attitude to the issues of governance if its move to enforce stricter discipline in the party ranks has been taken with an eye on next year?s assembly polls in Bengal. The party needs to show stronger evidence that it really intends to give a free hand to Mr Bhattacharjee to run his government.

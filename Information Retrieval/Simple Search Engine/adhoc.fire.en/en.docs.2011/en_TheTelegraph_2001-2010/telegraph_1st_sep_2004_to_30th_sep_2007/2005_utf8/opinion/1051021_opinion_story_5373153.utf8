 Paperback Pickings

 Anger on the agenda

 Why I am not a Hindu (Samya, Rs 180) is the second edition of Kancha Ilaiah?s book which raised a stir when it was first published in 1996. This was quite understandable. Hindus, (upper-castes, to be sure) have always tried to explain and thus appropriate the vast numbers of the sudras or Dalits or bhangis (call them what you will), so it wasn?t pleasant to have a Sudra stand up and reject Hinduism on the grounds that his experience of life ? social, economic, spiritual, cultural ? was so different from that of a Brahmin, a Kshatriya or a Vaishya that he could well be from another planet. The sangh parivar-types were especially offended, as Ilaiah notes in his afterword. This last, which is the only addition in this edition, talks about the book?s reception over the years, the free-flowing brickbats and the cautious praise from newspaper reviewers, academics, feminists and the like. Curiously, there is nothing on how the political empowerment of the ?Dalitbahujans? has become mired in the personal ambitions and political wrangling of the BSPs and the SPs.

 New Life (IndiaInk, Rs 295) by Sharmistha Mohanty is all about a girl, Anjali, growing up in Calcutta, who goes to the US to do a course in creative writing and her relationships with three men, Riaz, Richard and Amar. It must have been familiar territory for Mohanty, a Calcutta girl who attended a writers? workshop in Iowa. But then, haven?t writers always tapped their own lives to write fiction?

The Gods of Glass (Umschlaggestaltung, euro 

19.9) by Madan M. Sauldie is quite a potboiler. Raja Ghanshyam, who 

lives in Shanti Mahal and is the last ruler of the ancient kingdom of Rampur, 

wages a war to oust Great V of the City of Goradham, with the help of his brothers, 

Jugnauth and Narendra. Great V dies, of natural causes, but even before Ghanshyam 

can begin celebrating, his two brothers put a spanner in the works. They demand 

their share in the family estates. Soon after, Ghanshyam too dies and the plot 

reaches a stalemate. The cast also includes a young man, Ramesh, an unwitting 

witness to the palace intrigues who gives tuitions to Aasha, a lady of the palace. 

They fall in love and marry, expectedly in the face of much opposition. Sauldie?s 

debut novel lives up to the description in the blurb about its being ?a story 

which one could only cry to laugh.?

 READY TO MOVE ON

 By accepting that India had gained from British rule, Manmohan Singh showed that he leads a nation which looks ahead, says Bhaskar Ghose

 Walking together

 ?Today, with the balance and perspective offered by the passage of time...it is possible for an Indian prime minister to assert that India?s experience with Britain had its beneficial consequences too. Our notions of the rule of law, of a constitutional government, of a free press, of a professional civil service, of modern universities and research laboratories have all been fashioned in the crucible where an age-old civilization met the dominant Empire of the day.? (Extract from Manmohan Singh?s July 8, 2005 address at Oxford University)

 It would have been easy for Manmohan Singh to deliver an address that was comfortably familiar, repeating stuff about the close ties between the two countries, about how they were partners in the endeavour to bring about greater development, and so on. He would have been politely applauded, and life would have carried on as usual. But he chose to make a statement that was not cast in the standard mould ? he made an assertion that everyone knows to be true but which lesser statesmen choose to gloss over, or pretend never happened. Singh knew that the media in India would carry his address in great detail, but he made it nonetheless. It was perhaps the scholar in him who cannot gloss over the truth, no matter how disagreeable it may be to some.

 For too long we have beaten the British over the head with the atrocities committed during colonial rule. There were atrocities, and brutal ones at that. There was repression; there was the use of state power against defenceless people. But as the years of colonial rule receded into the past, and as we grew into a confident democracy, it was time for us to look ahead and at ourselves critically so that we kept ourselves a free people, and preserved and nourished our fledgling democracy. The trauma of the past had necessarily to be confined to the past ? a past that has many other instances of state power using brutal methods to subjugate.

 True, we have had a way of fashioning the institutions that we adopted ? parliamentary democracy, in this case ? in a manner uniquely our own. Legislators assaulting one another, trying to get at the speaker, ripping out microphones and throwing chairs about became our way of opposing a particular motion, or reacting to a particular event. Rushing into the well of the house has now become an act sanctified over the years and used to make a point forcefully. As is the calculated chaos in a legislature, meant to stall all business such as passing laws and proposals meant, finally, to better social and economic conditions. But, while these may cause concern, they are really a process through which our tumultuous society finds institutional expression, and must be seen, and accepted, as such.

 One of the most common devices used to proclaim one?s patriotism and to chivvy people into falling in line has been to vilify the British colonial rulers. As a result of this, the image that one is more familiar with than any other is of a breed of cruel despots who tried to keep the Indian people under their jackboot. Which, like any political image, is a distorted one ? true in part, and false in part. 

 It is to Singh?s credit that he has acknowledged, not as an individual or as a former student of Oxford University, but as he himself said, as a prime minister of India, how India has benefited from British rule. These are benefits all of us are perfectly aware of, including our politicians, but over the years it has become not only inappropriate but even unpatriotic to mention them publicly.

 And yet, as Singh himself pointed out, two of the greatest leaders of our struggle for freedom, both of whom were jailed for considerable periods by the British, spoke warmly of what India had gained from its rulers. His recounting of what Gandhiji said would, I am sure, have startled many. Asked how far he would cut India off from the British Empire, Gandhiji?s reply was: ?From the Empire, entirely; from the British nation not at all, if I want India to gain and not to grieve.? This was in 1931. Singh also reminded his audience in Oxford and here at home of what Jawaharlal Nehru had said in the constituent assembly, arguing for India?s joining the Commonwealth: ?We have to wash out the past, with all its evil.?

 By publicly acknowledging the good that we inherited from the British rulers of the past, Singh made one thing very evident: the India he leads is looking ahead, and can do so without any colonial baggage. There need be no accusations, on the one hand, and no seeking of favours on the other. In his words, ?The challenge before us is to see how we can take this mutually beneficial relationship forward in an increasing interdependent world.? The key phrase is ?mutually beneficial?; the relationship needs to be one that benefits both, not just one.

 This statement is one that a nation confident of itself can make. If Singh chose to make that statement where he did, he did so, one can be certain, with considerable thought. This was not a top-of-the-head statement. It was a speech that recognized that what he was saying would find an echo in present day India, in Generation Next, more particularly. 

 As would his later comment, ?Today, English in India is seen as just another Indian language.? That is what young Indians obviously feel. One has to listen to them speak, watch the television channels they find attractive, go to the films they like and ask them directly to see the truth of this. Their counter to questions on English as a language in India is ?What?s the big deal, yaar??

 No one is saying that one should instantly go out and extol the virtues of colonial rule in election campaigns. But Singh was speaking for a huge number of people who know that what he has said is the truth, and that it needed saying, finally. The fact that he did demonstrates, as very little else does, that we have come of age as a society; in at least this one respect. We have and can assert a confidence in ourselves; our institutions will endure, in their own way; even the throwing of chairs in legislative chambers may become hallowed, as the years pass, as a proud tradition, to be ritually performed before the day?s business is taken up.

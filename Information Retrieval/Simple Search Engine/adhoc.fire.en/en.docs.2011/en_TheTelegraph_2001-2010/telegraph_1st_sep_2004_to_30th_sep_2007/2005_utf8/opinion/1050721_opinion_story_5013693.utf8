 TRUST IN US

 Christopher Columbus, as Mr Manmohan Singh reminded his audience in Washington, came upon America thinking he had landed in India. But it has taken India more than five decades of deliberation to discover the United States of America. Mr Singh?s recognition that India and the US are ?natural partners in many respects?? is a reversal of India?s political and economic attitude towards the US. Jawaharlal Nehru may once have heard echoes of the American constitution in the Indian, but his own foreign policy was a victim of the Cold War. Under the rhetoric of non-alignment, he remained slightly tilted on the Soviet side. Thus suspicion and hostility informed India?s attitude towards the US. The pursuit of socialist goals through planning added to the animosity towards the US, which in turn was inclined to see Pakistan as a natural ally. India?s attitude began to change under the astute leadership of Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, and Washinton?s towards India only after Islamic terrorists attacked New York. Mr Singh?s successful visit to Washington, and the applause and the plaudits that he has earned, is a culmination of this process of change and mutual recognition of reciprocal interests.

 A new mood of optimism has come in the train of the prime minister?s visit. There can be no denial of the fact that India stands to gain significantly from a close friendship with the US. Only the ideologically blind will find in this friendship a threat to India?s independence. Such prophets of doom are irrelevant and incorrigible. A different kind of caution is in order. India?s policymakers have a tendency to be swayed too much in one direction. Instead of becoming too cosy with Washington, South Block should keep in place a dose of scepticism. Foreign policy can only be dictated by the furthering of national interests and not be protestations of friendship. The US should not be allowed to set the terms of friendship. There are no natural partners in diplomacy, only the assiduous cultivation of self-interest. The track record of the US in the pursuit of democracy outside its own shores is not particularly edifying. India?s pursuit of its own interests in Asia may not be in concordance with US designs on the continent. The success of Mr Singh?s visit and Washington?s bonhomie should not be allowed to cloud judgment. To be invited to the high table has its own demands on responsibility and protocol.

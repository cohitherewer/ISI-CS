 DREAMING OF GREEN

 There are some political parties that suffer from a deep insecurity. They need attention all the time, and are terrified of oblivion when they think that people are managing to get on with their everyday lives too smoothly or, even more alarming, might even manage to enjoy themselves during a festive season. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) would head this list. It must have its rally on December 28, and it must, true to its spoilt nature, have it on the Brigade Parade Grounds. The Eastern Command of the army might have serious concerns and noble aims regarding the restoration of the greens in its charge, it might have the right to refuse permission for political rallies to be held there because of the destruction such gatherings leave behind. None of this can stop the CPI(M)-backed coordination committee of state government employees and associations. The show of strength begins from getting party leaders in Delhi and Calcutta, including the chief minister of West Bengal, to persuade the Union defence minister to override the Eastern Command?s policy. Reportedly, the desire to keep a major coalition supporter happy prompted the defence minister to give permission for the rally on the Brigade Parade Grounds.

 It would be folly to look for logic or consistency. Permission has already been given for the Book Fair to be held in its old place, in spite of the army?s worries about environmental destruction, because the proposed new grounds intended for the fair are not going to be ready on time. There might be unanswered questions about the state of the new grounds the year after as well. When exceptions become the rule, the idea of a rule seems nonsensical. And when the exceptions are made only in cases of the most powerful lobbies, political or otherwise, the scene begins to look murkier. The arguments for the CPI(M) rally, that any other place is too small, or that exceptions are being made, can be reiterated by other political parties too, when they are rally-minded. And since rallies, in spite of many noises to the contrary, are still major disruptions of civic life, there is no reason why other parties should not join in the attention-getting exercise. Would the chief minister talk to the Union defence minister should the army refuse to permit a Congress or Trinamool Congress rally? Or would the army become a victim of logic and permit them anyway?

 Work culture, a smooth and civillized urban life, the preserving of the environment ? these are obviously nowhere on the horizon of the CPI(M)?s intellect. That is not surprising. But pulling strings to arrange for a favour for his own party surely does not become the chief minister of a state. His rhetoric about the future of West Bengal seems to have been misleading.

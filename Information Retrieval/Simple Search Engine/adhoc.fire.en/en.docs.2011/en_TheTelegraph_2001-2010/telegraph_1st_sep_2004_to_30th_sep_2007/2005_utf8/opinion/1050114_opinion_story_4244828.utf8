 GUESSING THE READER?S MOOD

 Will it sell?

Here are five basic questions that publishers ask themselves before taking a decision to publish a book: Who are the readers? What do they want? What do they need? What turns them off and on? What is relevant to them?

 To answer these ancient questions, publishers have exploited every tool from market research to the Chinese classic on astrology, The Book of Change or I Ching. Sometimes this research has got them short-range results. But because people change, do not always know their needs, and do not want to reveal what they know themselves, there are no long-range answers. So, when publishers say they know the market, what does it really amount to? But let us first see what they really know after some years of playing the game or, to put it crudely, ?after having walked the streets.?

 First, the smaller and more specialized the audience, the easier it is to identify some of its interests and attitudes. For instance, if you take tertiary-level textbooks or scholarly monographs, it is pretty simple to get a fix on the likely market response: we know the number of students taking the courses, the competing books and their price range, what they lack and then, on a conservative estimate, work for a 5 to 10 per cent of market share to start with, making sure that the marketing and distribution arrangements have been properly hyped up.

 We also know that the reader of monographs doesn?t want to read more than is strictly necessary and that the language should be simple and direct. Throw in illustrations and pictures to supplement the text, slap on an attractive cover and you have a package with a reasonable chance of success.

 But there are two problems with specialized studies. First, the market is limited and therefore print runs are small which means that economies of scale don?t work and the price tends to be high. Marketing and distribution costs are high too because there are not many retailers who would like to handle specialized books with a narrow appeal. Publishers have to bear heavy publicity costs like advertising and direct mailing of leaflets.

 Second, outside of textbook requirements, which can be worked out by the course content given in the syllabus, it is very difficult to determine what is relevant or not. 

 The real problem of determining market response based on the five questions arises with fiction or mass-market paperbacks. There are no precise criteria for determining whether a book would sell or not. Publishers say they know the market based on their experience but invariably, this is nothing more than a hunch. Sometimes they are right; quite often wrong if you go by the number of duds or the number of bestsellers that have slipped through simply because of poor judgment.

 But nebulous as the whole process of whether to publish or not is, there are some checks against which a manuscript ? at least in India ? has to be assessed.

 First, its relevance, that is, how well it ?fits in? with the prevailing moods and interests of the common reader. For instance, in romantic fiction of the Mills and Boon kind, how well does it deal with the newly liberated woman? Or, does it still stick to the conventional ?man-meets-woman, has a quarrel, patches up to get married and live happily ever after? formula? Or, in serious fiction, does it deal with the contingency of things, the music of chance? Relevance can be defined in several ways but the rule of thumb is how sensitive it is to the mood of the time.

 Language plays the central role in the success of any book in India, fiction or non-fiction. It has to be simple and direct; as far as possible, no compound sentences, no ifs and buts. Put these in, and you can be sure the common reader won?t go beyond a few pages.

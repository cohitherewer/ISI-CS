 KEEP THE TREASURES UNDER LOCK AND KEY 

Protecting the nation?s heritage is a costly affair, 

not only in terms of the funds needed but also in the commitment it demands, writes 

Bhaskar Ghose 

 Soft target 

The theft of the Buddha image from the Indian Museum 

has led to comments from various quarters on the need to improve the security 

of our museums, on the laxity of the authorities in these institutions. All of 

these miss the real point, which is the amazing fact that more such thefts haven?t 

occurred.

A very large proportion of the exhibits in our museums 

are of great value; they would fetch huge amounts were they to be sold in international 

auctions. Putting them out in the galleries of our museums is like laying out 

large numbers of diamonds, rubies and emeralds and several kilograms of gold in 

flimsy glass-covered racks and shelves and hoping no one would filch them.

And to keep this from happening, the museums have 

a handful of guards, virtually no electronic surveillance, leave alone systems 

that ensure automatic closing of doors and sealing of showcases should any object 

be touched or someone get too close to them. 

But even the pitiful security there is in the Indian 

Museum ? and, be it said, in other museums like the National Museum and Salar 

Jung Museum ? is comprehensive compared to what smaller museums have. Some of 

them have objects that are very rare and just as priceless as the ones in the 

larger museums. The once-much-talked-about Didarganj Yakshi is in the Patna Museum, 

and one can well imagine the security that museum has.

But leave these aside. Consider the site museums and 

archaeological sheds ? I think that?s what they call them ? that the Archaeological 

Survey of India has dotted about the country at various locations. 

There?s one, for example, in Khajuraho, where, behind 

a barbed wire fence there are a number of the most exquisite figurines ? apsaras 

that once adorned chambers within the temples, pieces of sculpture from walls 

and gates that have fallen, or been removed over the centuries, and a number of 

pieces recovered from thieves in the neighbourhood. I confess I saw this some 

years ago and since then, the ASI may well have built a museum building to house 

all of these; but who guards them? A couple of chowkidars I would imagine, and 

I would be very surprised if they were awake on cold winter nights. And this is 

just one of several such collections the ASI has.

Not that they haven?t tried to move them to bigger 

museums, but they?ve come across local opposition ? the local people feel these 

are a part of their heritage and want them kept where they are. This is a central 

part of a problem that seems to defy solution; I certainly found it difficult 

to resolve when I was secretary, culture. The great need to ensure that these 

priceless objects are securely protected is a very, very costly affair, which 

raises a very basic question to which I?ll come in a moment. 

There are other problems as well. I mentioned one, 

the local opposition to moving sculptures from relatively isolated locations like 

Khajuraho or Tikamgarh, in Madhya Pradesh to larger museums in bigger cities. 

One can understand the sentiments of the local people, but providing the kind 

of security that?s needed at these remote locations becomes an impossible task. 

The sculptures simply have to be moved; but who?s to persuade the people of the 

area?

Assume that it can be done, though; assume that the 

valuable sculptures and artefacts we have are brought to some major museums where 

it is possible to provide the very best security. What then? The kind of electronic 

devices that are needed are hugely expensive and so is their day-to-day maintenance. 

Where will the money come from? The revenue that the museums get from the sale 

of tickets, brochures and pictures? The amount is a fraction of what?s needed.

And apart from the money, there?s the question of 

personnel. It?s all very well to decide that the Central Industrial Security Force 

or some other body will take over security. But have they any idea what the task 

actually means, on the ground? Have they been trained to deal with professional 

burglars who have a sound knowledge of the location of the galleries and exhibits 

and the ways in and out of the buildings, be it the Indian Museum, the National 

Museum or any other. The CISF battalions are rotated from time-to-time; do their 

men really get the intensive training and familiarization that they need to do 

the job truly effectively, apprehending thieves without damaging the objects they 

may have stolen, to take an example?

We need to look at the problem rationally. There is 

an enormous number of demands on the finances of the Central government, ranging 

from defence to health, education, roads, water and a multitude of others. No 

one is saying that protecting our heritage is not vitally important; but exactly 

what must one give up to find the funds to do it in the way it needs to be done?

It would be futile to expect that government funds 

would be available to provide the kind of security system that?s needed. Consider, 

the Indian Museum has over a million exhibits on display; one can well imagine 

the scale of the security, the number of electronic devices, the number of well-trained 

regular security staff that would be needed to keep this huge number of exhibits 

secure. And, as if this were not enough, the fact is that the Indian Museum displays 

only about 10 per cent of its holdings at any given time.

The answer must lie in generating the funds in a number 

of ways; through revenue generating projects and outreach programmes, activities 

that attract people and generate revenues, like letting some distinguished institutions 

hold dinners and other special occasions in some part of the museum at a considerable 

fee, and trying to raise funds abroad.

A part of this endeavour could be to classify objects, 

which I know is done, but then to physically move the most valuable to the most 

secure areas, provide them with the most intensive protection; the next category 

would also be protected, of course, but perhaps not on the same scale, and so 

on.

I know what will inevitably follow this statement. 

If, many will say, you?re recommending all this now, what were you doing when 

you were secretary, culture? A very valid charge, and all I can say is that we 

did try to initiate some projects, but that they were not nearly enough, and I 

wasn?t there to see what happened to them finally. The planning takes time, the 

execution even more time, given our tortuous governmental ways, and meanwhile, 

officers move on. Not just secretaries ? directors of museums as well.

This, I must confess, is one of the greatest setbacks 

to any major project to change the way things are. People get moved, and those 

who are in these positions aren?t always as motivated as others; not just that, 

motivated officers are not always able to convince the financial authorities of 

the justification for their projects. And their efforts are thwarted when they 

find the financial adviser has changed, or they themselves move to other assignments.

At least now one can look back and see just what the 

remedy must be, and mention it. That one failed oneself, in a bizarre way, helps 

to see the pitfalls more clearly. And to realize that it can be done, there are 

ways; all it needs is for the right people to take these in hand, and to stay 

on long enough to ensure that their projects are fully implemented.

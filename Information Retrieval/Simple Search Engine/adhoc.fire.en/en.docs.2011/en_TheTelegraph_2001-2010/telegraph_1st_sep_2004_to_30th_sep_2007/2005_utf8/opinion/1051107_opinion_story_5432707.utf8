 What India might learn by looking at China

 Commentarao / S.L. Rao

 Almost 70 years ago, Catherine Mayo, a journalist, after a brief India visit wrote a damning portrait of India, that Gandhiji famously called ?a drain inspector?s report?. After 10 days of visiting three big cities, Shanghai, Xian and Beijing, I can write neither a drain inspector?s report nor heap the praise that Edgar Snow poured on the rising communist movement in China in his Red Star over China, giving it legitimacy among liberals over the world. My comments are from observations in three of the most prosperous cities over 10 days.

 Indians will have to increasingly compete with China during this century for markets, physical and financial resources, and international political support and in military strength. We must make concerted attempts to understand China.

 In China, there is considerable symbolism in communication. If Indians are direct, the Chinese are indirect and allusive. But they have one unifying characteristic, the passionate desire to be prosperous and possess all the symbols of prosperity. While ideas of democracy and freedom might appear at times, they may not be the drivers of society.

 One is struck by the organized manner in which work gets done. If a portion of road has to be re-laid, it is done at one stretch, with minimal dislocation, and speedily. The use of wood in the construction of ancient monuments made them susceptible to damage. Many ancient monuments have been thoroughly rebuilt or reconstructed in the last 25 years. The reconstructions are good. These recently rebuilt structures are the symbols of ancient China.

 The famous terracotta warriors of the Quin dynasty 2000 years ago in Xian were part of the tomb complex of an emperor, discovered in 1974. They had been broken and damaged by fire and looting. Some of them have been meticulously repaired and reconstructed. The main mound, in which the emperor?s tomb with suspected valuables of great significance are buried, has been secured but left untouched till they can find a technology that will prevent rapid deterioration of the stored contents on opening the mound. A magnificent museum has been built and the reconstructed warriors stand in impressive and orderly military discipline. 

 All this has been done in less than 25 years. The terracotta warriors are now labelled the eighth wonder of the world and to go with the exhibit is a magnificent film story on the construction and eventual loot by marauding later kings. Over 1.5 million visitors to China come to Xian each year. 

 In contrast are the surroundings of one of the original Seven Wonders of the World, the Taj Mahal. The surroundings are filthy. Sloppy semi-literates operate the booths. There are touts everywhere and no visual representation that tells the story of its construction or the love that designed it. The World Heritage sites at Hampi and Mahabalipuram are no better.

 China thinks big. The network of intertwining flyovers in Shanghai, Beijing and Xian are reminiscent of Los Angeles. There are highways on concrete stilts with three lanes on either side speeding the traveller over long distances to famous tourist sites or from airports to town centres.

 Contrast this with the filthy approach to Mumbai?s international airport and the chaos surrounding the widening of that road over the last two years. 

 Bangalore?s successful information technology industry wants a road on stilts for a measly 11 kilometres from Bangalore to Hosur to avoid the unpredictable delays due to city and lorry traffic. There is opposition to it. The airport road in Bangalore as in many other Indian cities has been used to enable municipalities, politicians, municipal corporators and officials to make money by permitting construction of huge office properties alongside, condemning the roads to be forever with two or at best three lanes. 

 Lack of democracy has also saved China from the leadership of narrow-minded and selfish politicians who delay decisions indefinitely while they feather their own nests.

 Traffic is heavy in Chinese cities. Drivers often do not respect pedestrian rights. But unlike India, there are no cars, nor roadside stalls or hawkers or cattle to clog the main roads. At least along the main roads there no stink of urine or garbage. Their public toilets are apparently much better than they used to be but they accept that they must build more Western-style toilets and provide toilet paper. In the more famous places, the toilets are constantly cleaned. This is unlike even the toilets in our airports that have water and urine seeping on the floors.

 Pollution is all pervading in the big cities. From the air, little can be made out of the countryside. Visibility in these big cities is poor even in daytime. There is far less greenery in the cities than in India. Deforestation has reached levels where there is a move to replace traditional wooden chopsticks with metal and plastics. London cleaned up its smog and the polluted Thames between 1960 and 1975. Tokyo is on its way to cleaning its awful environment. There is hope for disciplined China to do it as quickly.

 China has joined the World Trade Organization but disregards intellectual property rights. Shanghai has a large and well-known ?fake market? where prices can be bargained down within a minute or so by 80 per cent. Omega Seamaster watches for Rs 1500, Gucci leather bags for Rs 400, famous brand name wallets for Rs 150, CDs and DVDs for a fraction of their prices elsewhere ? the bargains are unbelievable. Chinese competition will be irresistible when it uses its ability to make high-quality imitations of famous brands to make and sell products under their own brand names at low prices.

 China has still not forgotten the difficult years when it was not an economic giant. Changing money into yuan is easy but it is very difficult to change it back. But there are few beggars in the major cities. Food is extremely cheap, as is petrol and therefore possibly other fuels as well. Low-level public servants appear honest. There is no harassment of tips and bribes. Service providers like waiters; taxi drivers, porters, and so on do not expect tips.

 Communicating in English is almost impossible even in airports, hotels or tourist centres. English that is spoken is basic. Asking for band-aid to staunch a cut in the hand leads to the offer of an emory board instead. Woe betide the visitor who ventures out without addresses and directions in Chinese characters that can be shown to anyone on the road.

 There is just no one to tell you anything in English. Before chauvinistic Indian political champions of the vernacular begin rejoicing, they must realize that China today is based on the absence of English because of a dedicated system that offers good quality education in Chinese. Our time for linguistic chauvinism is long past. We can no longer experiment with vernacular instruction, with neither textbooks nor teachers to offer quality instruction. The revolution caused by telecommunications and information technology makes English our strongest comparative advantage. Our children must be taught English (and regional languages as well so that they do not get shaken from their roots).

 Even a brief visit to China is an eye-opener. Indians must go there as must Indian politicians of the likes of H.D. Deve Gowda, the many chauvinistic regional politicians that we have spawned since 1967 and our head-in-the-sand communists.

 China has much to teach us. It is by no means a communist country. It is a capitalist economy in a totalitarian state. It has no pretensions to ideology except the survival of the party and economic growth. Perhaps survival is also the aim of our communists but they do not seem to have any national interest to go with it.

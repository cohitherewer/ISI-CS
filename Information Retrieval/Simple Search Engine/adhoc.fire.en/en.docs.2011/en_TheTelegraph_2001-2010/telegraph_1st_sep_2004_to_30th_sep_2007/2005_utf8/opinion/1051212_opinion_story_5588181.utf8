 TOUCH OF FEAR

 A many-sided issue may become muddied by simplistic responses. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) has responded predictably to the notion of foreign universities setting up branches in India. They are against it, and against the entry of foreign institutions in the health sector as well. Both issues are part of a discussion around the General Agreement on Trade in Services, and the discussion is gaining in intensity since India must decide one way or another. The left?s objections come at a time the Centre is drafting a bill on foreign universities so that adequate checks and balances are instituted. 

 This is by no means an easy decision. The benefits and disadvantages must be thought through thoroughly and hard, and intelligent discussion would be greatly helpful. The rhetoric in which the left?s objections are couched, as in the statements of the CPI(M) member of parliament, Mr Nilotpal Basu, is certainly not helpful. A part of the objection has to do with the pollution of the social and cultural milieu in India, an argument that has been ridden to death by the right and the left alike at every conceivable opportunity. And the other part follows inevitably, that the left would have no ?control? over branches of foreign universities. The CPI(M)?s anxiety has driven its MP to be rather too frank about the way the party views educational institutions in West Bengal. The whole argument ? if the paranoia about cultural pollution can be dismissed as irrepressible pathology ? detracts from the really serious issues and boils down to the CPI(M)?s neurotic fear of losing ?control?. Before any decision can be taken, it is extremely important that the right checks and balances be worked out. There are certainly many worries. The possibility of fly-by-night operators playing fast and loose with the dreams of aspiring Indian youngsters, for example, must be eliminated at the very beginning. It is wise to go slowly. But it would be rather silly not to consider the possibilities out of various kinds of fear.

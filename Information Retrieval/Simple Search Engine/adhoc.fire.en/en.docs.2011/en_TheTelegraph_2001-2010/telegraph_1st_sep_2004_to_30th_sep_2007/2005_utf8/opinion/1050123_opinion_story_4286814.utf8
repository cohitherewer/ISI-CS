 FIRST VOLLEY

 She had wanted to see how hard Serena Williams hit the ball. Sania Mirza managed to do not only that, but she also hit back for a long enough while for Williams to feel that it had not been a ?walk in the park? playing the comparatively diminutive first-timer in the Australian Open. It is amazing how hard the realities are even behind a fairy-tale that did not quite reach the happily-ever-after mode. Williams?s comment that it was good to see ?someone from India? do so well for the first time may be sounded on many keys ? a few a little off ? but there is more relevance in it than she probably suspects. For a nation of a billion people, India is sadly short of tennis stars. Women players on the international circuit are even rarer: Mirza follows Nirupama Vaidyanathan, who follows Nirupama Mankad and Anu Peshawaria before her. But no one got as far as Mirza. 

 Tennis is a rich country?s game. Behind every tennis player who goes far, there is a family which believes in him and is ready to give its all. The comparative prosperity of Leander Paes?s parents, or of Mirza?s, or of all the others who have broken into the magic circle, is simply not enough. The expense to sustain and keep raising the level of a promising youngster?s game mounts over the years, with the attendant risk that his greatest achievements may ultimately not be good enough. And the hardest decisions have to be made about schooling and formal studies, which are of utmost importance in a developing country. In India, making a tennis player out of a child is an act of faith. The relentless practice time and total mental focus can be created only by sacrifices on many levels. Mirza, like Paes in his earlier tours, was without a travelling coach, a physiotherapist or anyone else in her retinue. All she had was brilliance, and ?character?, that mixture of confidence, determination, an appetite for challenge and an aggressive interest in playing with the best in the world, without which no sportsperson can take on the opponent in an apparently unequal game.

 Inevitably, Mirza?s success, or her defeat by Serena Williams, carries with it a load of resonances that would be unthinkable in another country. In her personality and attitude, she represents the new generation of sportspersons and, even more significantly perhaps, the new generation of Indian women. The last label encapsulates decades of a struggle that is still intense for the majority of Indian women. Another dimension to her representative identity derives from the fact that she belongs to a minority community, which is perceived as not encouraging its women to step out into the world. While Mirza works hard to make her dreams come true, she will be carrying with her, willy-nilly, the dreams of a nation longing for greater excellence in the arena of individual sports.

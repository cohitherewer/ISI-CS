 Letters to Editor

 The great Indian nightmare

 Sir ? Talent hunt shows have been, for some years now, the young Indian?s shortcut to fame and success. Perhaps something like the Science City stampede at the auditions for Sony?s Fame Gurukul last week was needed ? for people to wake up to the fact that what is touted as a dream opportunity has the makings of the worst kind of nightmare. The young boys and girls who turn up in thousands every time an audition takes place ? and make no mistake about it, many of them are truly talented ? are running after huge recording contracts, crores in prize money, cars, foreign trips and, ultimately, celebrityhood. But it doesn?t take a great deal of intelligence, only the ability to see things as they are, to see that only a couple of talent-hunt winners ? Sunidhi Chauhan and Shreya Ghoshal ? have been able to make it big in the film industry. Is it worth the bruises and hurt?

 Yours faithfully,

 Shubhra Gupta, Calcutta

 Question of belief

 Sir ? Whether India?s latest polar satellite launch vehicle owed its launch to Balaji?s grace or the technical competence of the scientists of the Indian Space Research Organization, the front-page news was in bad taste. Particularly when our space programme has reached a stage of maturity. The real use of this PSLV, though no one will admit it, is as a surveillance device on our highly porous borders. It is time we shed the long-harboured conviction that the fruits of space research should only have civilian uses. With effective surveillance, we can minimize the loss of lives during intrusions from across the border.

 Yours faithfully,

Bijit K. Sarkar, Calcutta

 Sir ? I was quite amused to read ?Space science in the Lord?s hands? (May 5). It reminded me of a cartoon I had drawn four years back, as a graduate student in the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. The cartoon was about the saffronization of the highest positions of the Indian education establishment, particularly science and technology. Even a few years ago, the absurd idea of consulting priests before a satellite launch would be unthinkable. But The Telegraph deserves thanks for publishing this entirely novel aspect of our space programme.

 Yours faithfully,

Ayan Guha, Austin, US

 Sir ? If we claim to live in a secular country, then some of our scientists are indeed sending ominous signals out to the world.While I do not see anything wrong in an individual scientist believing in supernatural powers, that should not be brought to bear upon a project he is handling on behalf of the entire nation. And Balaji is not even the presiding deity of machinery, like Vishwakarma!

 Yours faithfully, 

Pijush Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? Praying to Balaji for the success of a satellite launch has bewildered many readers, although stranger things are known to happen in this country. But why? What is wrong in offering prayers for the success of a mission or a project? Particularly when it is for the larger benefit of society. Faith and science are not at odds with each other, in fact there are several points of convergence between the two. Reactions of some eminent scientists, such as Ajay Sood and K.L. Chopra, sound quite unconvincing. Who is to say if the larger section of the people subscribe to their view? The Telegraph has gone overboard in trying to sensationalize what must be a normal action on the part of G. Madhavan Nair, the ISRO chief, and his colleagues. I feel proud of them.

 Yours faithfully,

Subhash Ashutosh, Shillong

 Sir ? It is very easy to say that the scientists who seek god?s blessings before a satellite launch do not have a ?scientific? attitude. But we are forgetting a few things here.

 Modern-day science is firmly based on logic, leaving no room for ?speculations?. But there are so many things about life that no science has been able to explain, and probably never will. Take love for instance. Would anyone who has ever been in love believe the scientist?s explanation that it is a manifestation of certain hormone-induced biological changes? If the scientists had gone to the temple in their personal capacities they have every right to do so. 

 Yours faithfully,

Basudev Roy, Maryland, US

 Sir ? Actions taken in a professional capacity should have nothing to do with one?s personal predilections. In fact, some time ago, there was an incident at an Ivy League school where the dean of the ethics department was discovered to be in possession of pornographic material. But aren?t we mixing up professional and personal values here? Religion, after all, caters to the soul and everyone has the right to practise it in whichever fashion he wants.

 Yours faithfully,

Biplab Dey, Pittsburgh, US

 Sir ? The editorial, ?Public faith? (May 9), has pointed out how a distinction must be made between one?s religious faith and public duty. Most religions contain a lot of irrational ideas. People grow up to question some of these. Public display of one?s faith is best avoided by people holding public office.

 Yours faithfully,

Ashok Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir ? Science does not celebrate doubt, it attempts answers to questions. Religion, on the other hand, is born in the womb of faith. 

 The two are seen as opposing ideas, but are, in reality, closely connected to each other. In fact, science is born out of the rational quest of a faithful mind. When the path of reason gets obstructed, faith comes to the rescue, although some people may refuse to realize this. 

 Another area of confusion is the role of a secular state. The state is not above its people. It is nobody?s business, least of all the state?s, how one chooses to pursue his spiritual quest.

 Yours faithfully,

P. Banerjee, Durgapur

 Sir ? Would the English media of our country have been bothered if ISRO scientists went to a church or a mosque before the PSLV launch?

 Yours faithfully,

K. Sathish, Bangalore

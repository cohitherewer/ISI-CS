 STAR SIGNS

 - Recognizing the other victims

 Unlearning a lie

 The other side of Israel: My journey across the Jewish-Arab divide 

 By Susan Nathan,

 HarperCollins ?18.99

 Ships are often made to bear many of history?s burdens. In tumultuous 1948, when al-Malik Fuad set sail for distant Sweden from the ravaged shores of newborn Israel, carrying away Palestinian refugees from their homeland and families forever, it met another ship coming from the opposite direction. This one had its gunwale creaking under the weight of a jubilant people, taking in the sight of ?the promised land? for the first time, and waving their Jewish flags at the occupants of the first vessel that passed them. The world?s most-victimized people were making another set of people victims of their cherished dream, and were completely unaware of it. Susan Nathan probes this blissful ignorance of the displaced ?Other? and rediscovers some terrible truths.

 For her, the discovery starts late in life ? after a liberal Jewish upbringing in post-war Britain, a first-hand experience of apartheid South Africa, two children and a failed marriage. Having made her aliya or ?return? to Israel in 1999, Nathan, then a passionate Zionist, first settles down in Tel Aviv among a spirited Jewish population. Her conscience starts bothering her four months later, at the sight of a fully-armed civilian inside the hospital who, by his own admission, had just ?requisitioned? (broken into) an Arab home and had come to see his newborn. In the next few months, Nathan gathers enough information about the misdeeds of her dream state to be able to come to a rather dramatic decision ? to cross the Jewish-Arab ethnic divide and adopt a new home and a new family in Arab Tamra.

 The avowed objective of Nathan?s resettlement, she herself says, is to demonstrate that the fear that divides the two peoples is ?unrealistic?. So she breaks bread with her adopted family, helps the matriarch with the gardening, willingly submits to ?clothing inspection?, discovers the virtue of the hijab and partakes as enthusiastically of the festivities as of the rite of politics where parties go ?dressed up as families and families dressed up as parties?.

 Nothing wrong with that except Nathan appears more demonstrative than perhaps needed. But that seems a habit with her. For no other reason would she have brought up the subject of her having sex with a black man on the kitchen table, which, though a culmination of ?strong mutual attraction?, she wants her readers to read as ?not just a physical act?, but also ?an act of the most powerful political dissent?. 

 However, the truth she uncovers in the process for herself, but more importantly, for other Jews still wallowing in their sense of victimhood, is shocking. Through her insights into Israel?s state policy, her discussions with people ranging from the extreme left to the extreme right, her wanderings through villages, towns, holy places, Nathan shows how intrinsically the success of the Jewish state has come to depend on its success in obliterating the history and presence of the Arab population. The treatment meted out to Israeli-Arabs, or the ?present-absentees?, living in ghettos within Israel?s borders, denied their rightful share of the basic civic amenities, a proper education and employment opportunities, Nathan indicates, encapsulates all that is wrong with the Zionist mission.

 At the root of the Jewish aspiration is the return of a ?people without land to a land without people?. And this is where the greatest untruth lies. For the invasion of 1948 that founded Israel displaced 750,000 Arabs, forcing many into perpetual exile. Successive waves of annexation followed in the next decades, but it was the first act, the nakba or catastrophe, that sowed the seeds of the Middle East crisis, says Nathan. 

 Arabs who are not fenced off in the occupied territories of West Bank and the Gaza Strip, remain within the state in an ?open-air prison?, their houses declared illegal, their olive groves replanted by the Jewish National Fund with pine trees paid for by the Jewish diaspora and old Arab villages like Ein Hod converted into elitist Jewish preserves. For the Jews, the Arabs did not exist. They could not, for that would undo the very logic of living in Ein Hahoresh. As Menachim Begin once warned, ?If this is Palestine and not the Land of Israel, then you are conquerors and not tillers of the land. You are invaders.?

 Nathan establishes that that is precisely what her people are. And they continue to be so. The withdrawal from Gaza could be compensated by a push elsewhere, may be in the Old City?s narrow alleys, where the stink of shit and urine in front of their houses is expected to force Arabs to abandon their tenements, or in the centre of Hebron, where extremist religious settlers in the upper apartments of buildings pour boiling oil on Palestinian shopkeepers below to induce them to leave.

 Nathan has shown rare courage, and not merely by taking up residence in Tamra. She points an accusing finger at the Jewish left for failing to concede to the human aspect of the problem, as also at complacent Palestinians for their ?learned helplessness?. She represents a gathering force, both among Jews and Arabs, that may lead to a more genuine interface between the communities. But the psychological revolution that she is talking about may be more difficult to achieve. One, because the demographic problem in the Middle East seems insurmountable. And two, she forgets the involvement of other interest groups like the Western nations, particularly post-9/11 America and post-7/7 Britain. As Noam Chomsky points out, ?Under any arrangement that can be imagined...Israel will remain a Jewish state ? that is, a state based on the principle of discrimination. There is no other way for a state with non-Jewish citizens to remain a Jewish state, as all but the most irrational can concede.? But a separate state in a fraction of the land Palestinians originally held is something Nathan will just not have. A stalemate then?

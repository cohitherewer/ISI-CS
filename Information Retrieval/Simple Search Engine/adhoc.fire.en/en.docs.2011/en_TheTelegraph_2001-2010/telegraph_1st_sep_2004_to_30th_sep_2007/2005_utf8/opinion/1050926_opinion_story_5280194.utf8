 Letters to Editor

 Dumb charade

 Sir ? Contrary to what Bharat Bhushan (?The audacity of the general?, Sept 19) and K.P. Nayar (?The best is yet to come?, Sept 21) seem to believe, it was not Pervez Musharraf, but Manmohan Singh who came across as petulant and childish in New York. We were treated to the spectacle of an Indian prime minister walking out of a news conference mumbling a few incoherent words about the joint statement. Singh?s body language suggested that he was labouring under some powerful grudge or resentment. He had a stricken, hurt look on his face and his voice, feeble as usual, was hesitant and uncertain. It was as if he didn?t expect anyone to believe him. It is ironical that a man we call a ?dictator? was prepared to field questions from the media, while the prime minister of ?the largest democracy in the world? was running away from the media. It was a gesture that lacked grace and even ordinary courtesy. It showed weakness, and not strength. 

 Musharraf, for his part, came across as bold, aggressive and confident, not at all the wily general the columnists make him out to be. He seemed to be a man of authority who can speak forcefully and frankly on issues close to his heart. Manmohan Singh suffered by comparison. The Telegraph?s columnists obviously do not watch television and write their pieces with patriotic blinkers firmly in place.

 Yours faithfully,

Soumitro Das, Calcutta

 Sir ? Full marks to Bharat Bhushan for his assessment of the India-Pakistan farce at New York. He is absolutely right when he says that India has no plans on Kashmir. Of course, there is the ridiculous Lok Sabha resolution, mooted some time back, that contends that we will retake Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, as well as Aksai Chin, by force if need be. However, a credible reason for New Delhi?s playing hide and seek over Kashmir is that it is much more profitable for our politicians, especially the Kashmiri lot, to keep the Kashmir problem alive than to solve it.

 Another thing. Our prime minister has, rather gallantly, stated in New York that we will not be cowed down by terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir. Actually, it means giving carte blanche to Pakistan to increase terrorist activities. For India will never retaliate lest the so-called peace process gets disturbed. This is typically the Gandhian philosophy of turning the other cheek. 

 Yours faithfully,

J.K. Dutt, Calcutta

 Sir ? The United Nations was created to promote world peace, cooperation and encourage respect for human rights. But time has shown how it has helped the growth of a unipolar world. The organization?s 60th convention was just another occasion for the developed countries to flaunt their muscles and do business with the developing world. The closure of the Scorpene submarine deal between India and France should be seen in that context. So should Condoleezza Rice?s supposed request to Manmohan Singh that he should assuage Pervez Musharraf?s concerns (?Talking on the side?, Sept 17).

 But peace in Kashmir is likely to remain a mirage as both India and Pakistan will not budge an inch from their stand. This is a turmoil that has gone on for five decades at enormous human cost. The Kashmir problem can be solved only with the spontaneous participation of the Kashmiris. And New York is not the place for this. Discussion must be held with moderate separatists to elicit the opinion of the Kashmiris. But, surely, India cannot withdraw from Baramulla and Kupwara, which would bring terrorists to our doorstep? The dialogue has to be maintained, but supplemented with the likes of bus diplomacy and maybe the gas-pipeline adventure. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Subhankar Mukherjee, Borehat

 Sir ? The meeting between Manmohan Singh and Pervez Musharraf is being touted as a failure, but have such ?talks? really achieved much in the history of any nation? In the case of Pakistan, particularly, there is little hope of talks ?succeeding?. Pakistan is a politically unstable state, which means that there is every chance that the promises made by one head of state may not be kept by another. There is enough evidence to show that the suspicion is valid. Second, Pakistan has had a parallel administration in its military, which has never dithered from suppressing demo-cracy. It is interesting to see Musharraf now talking of democracy and self-determination when his own military has throttled the same within his own country. 

 Yours faithfully,

S.P. Sharma, Mumbai

 Sir ? The joint statement read out by Pervez Musharraf said that India and Pakistan had agreed not to allow terrorism to hinder the peace process, and that the two nations would continue to work towards a solution for all outstanding issues. There was no reference made to India?s demand that Pakistan end cross-border terrorism or to Pakistan?s demand for reduction of troops in Jammu and Kashmir. Aren?t we going round in circles?

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Sharma, Digboi, Assam

 Sir ? There is no doubt that Pervez Musharraf has come a long way from his early years in the presidency and has generated a lot of enthusiasm among the common people of his country about the peace process. Perhaps he should try harder to bring the terrorists under his control. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Md. Mudassir Alam, New Delhi

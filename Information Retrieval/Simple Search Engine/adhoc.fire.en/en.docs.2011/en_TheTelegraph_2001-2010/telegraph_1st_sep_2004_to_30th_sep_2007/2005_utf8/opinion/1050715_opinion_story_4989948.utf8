 ABOVE OWNERSHIP

 Historical monuments belong to history. They cannot belong to any community or sect. This self-evident premise is violated by the claim that the Taj Mahal is waqf property. This claim has been made by the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board. The grounds for making such a bizarre claim is that Friday prayers are offered at the mausoleum. The implication of this claim is that the waqf board will now have ?ownership?? of India?s most magnificent architectural structure. Thus preservation, maintenance and regulation of religious rituals would all be the responsibility of the board and of the caretaker (muttawali) appointed by it. This makes irrelevant the Archaeological Survey of India, which has been the monument?s custodian since 1920. It is important to remember in the context of the controversy stirred by the waqf board?s claim that Shah Jahan did not intend his beloved Taj Mahal to be a site for prayers and other religious rituals. It was built as a tribute to his wife and was designed as a monument to love. The fact that prayers have been allowed does not make the Taj Mahal a religious structure. There can be no doubt that the matter will go through many legal hearings and reiterations, but there is much more than legality at stake in the claim that the Taj Mahal is waqf property.

 The Taj Mahal is a product of Indian history. It thus belongs to India. To make it a waqf property is to make it belong to one sect of a religious community. This is a sectarian claim and violates the spirit that the Taj epitomizes. The UP Central Sunni Waqf Board should ponder the implications of its own decision. By trying to take away what belongs to India for itself, the waqf board is placing itself in a very vulnerable position. There has been a noticeable trend within the Muslim community to reform itself to bring it closer to civil society in India. The waqf board?s claim sends out signals that are at odds with the reformist trends. The claim will only serve to isolate the Muslim community from modern and democratic tendencies within Indian society. Since the Taj belongs to India, the elected representatives of the people of India, who have been entrusted to run India, should be allowed to preserve and maintain the Taj. In the process, the state might need the help of the waqf board. But the question of ownership of India?s greatest building is a non-starter.

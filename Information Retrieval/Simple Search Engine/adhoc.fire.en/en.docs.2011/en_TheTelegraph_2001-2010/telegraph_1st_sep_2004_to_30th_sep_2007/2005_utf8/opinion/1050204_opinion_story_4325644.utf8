 NEIGHBOURHOOD BULLY

Terror sans frontiers: Islamist militancy in North 

east India 

By Jaideep Saikia, 

Vision, Rs 395

The low-intensity war waged by separatists in the 

North-east is considered to be less dangerous than the violence in Kashmir. In 

this book, the author, Jaideep Saikia, warns that the complacency regarding the 

troubled North-east would cost India dear in the near future. The influx of immigrants 

from Bangladesh, claims Saikia, makes up the core of this threat.

 These immigrants have changed the demography of several northeastern districts. For instance, in Dhubri, the Muslims now constitute more than 70 per cent of the population. If the migration goes unchecked, then the indigenous inhabitants would be in the minority soon.

 Sadly, the Bangladesh government is not doing enough to stop this activity. This, it knows, will not only alleviate economic pressure on Dhaka but also promote instability in India. Radical Islamist parties in Bangladesh are providing tacit support to the insurgency in India?s northeast. Initially, the insurgency headed by outfits like the United Liberation Front of Asom and the All Tripura Tiger Force started on ethnic lines. But, pressure from Indian security forces and the Bhutanese army have forced these terrorists to flee to Bangladesh where they are provided with arms, logistic support and money. 

 Significantly, although ULFA was opposed to illegal immigration from Bangladesh earlier, now the prachar patras of the outfit say that the economy of Assam is driven by this influx. So, the immigrants, these leaflets assert, are an integral part of Assamese society. The principal enemy in ULFA?s eyes now is the Indian state. Of late, it has started targeting non-Assamese Hindus in the Brahmaputra Valley. The Inter-Services Intelligence and the Bangladeshi government, alleges Saikia, have a hand in forcing the militants not to surrender. Resistance to their dictates is rewarded with death.

 The fact that ULFA is fast losing ground in Assam is because Muslim youth in the state are leaving it to join militant organizations in Bangladesh. In the training camps of Sylhet and Cox?s Bazar, the recruits are not only supplied with weapons but measures are also taken to ensure that their ideological indoctrination is complete. This makes them believe in a merger between the Muslim-dominated regions of Assam with Bangladesh.

 Secularists and liberals are likely to find fault with Saikia?s book. But instead of criticizing him, we need to analyze his arguments to understand how an insurgency based on ethnic lines has been replaced by the threat from radical Islamist forces in India?s northeast. Terror Sans Frontiers might just be the book to open the eyes of an insouciant administration to the threats posed by a hostile and unfriendly neighbour.

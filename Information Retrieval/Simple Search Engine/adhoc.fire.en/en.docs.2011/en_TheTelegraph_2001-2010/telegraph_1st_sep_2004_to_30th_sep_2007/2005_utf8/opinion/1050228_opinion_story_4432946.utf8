 STORY LINE

 Even a fragmented electoral verdict has a central story line. At the centre of the verdict in Bihar is the people?s desire to end a regime that has come to symbolize all that is wrong with Indian politics. It is possible to interpret a fractured mandate in several ways. But there is no mistaking the people?s frustration with a government that failed on most counts but failed, above all, to protect the rule of law. Under Mr Laloo Prasad Yadav and then his wife, Ms Rabri Devi, Bihar saw the collapse of most institutions that ensure for the people a semblance of civilized living. On the other hand, corruption and criminality in public life and other forces of destabilization came to be institutionalized. The verdict clearly reflects the people?s desperation to break free from this state of insecurity and hopelessness. If it did not result in a more unambiguous rejection of Mr Yadav, the reason lies in the arithmetic of the elections. Even the results of the last two parliamentary polls in Bihar ? in 1999 and 2004 ? proved that Mr Ram Vilas Paswan of the Lok Janshakti Party could make or mar it for Mr Yadav. Despite the pathetic lack of governance, the Rashtriya Janata Dal could hope to win elections if it managed to get the arithmetic of social coalitions right. When the Congress and the LJP drifted away from him, Mr Yadav looked pretty vulnerable. Yet a complete rout of the RJD was prevented by the division in the opponents? ranks.

 However, coalition politics keeps enough room for the manipulation of fractured mandates. Enemies in Bihar, the RJD and the LJP are partners in the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre. The Congress may have been keen to cut Mr Yadav to size, but the compulsions of national politics dictate that it cannot give the advantage in Bihar to the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance. The question about who finally reigns in Patna is, therefore, inescapably linked to the strategy of saving the UPA regime in New Delhi. The Congress president, Ms Sonia Gandhi, who now has a tough balancing act to perform, may have to face a minor problem. The Election Commission?s directives favour a pre-poll alliance over a post-poll one when hung assemblies present difficulties in the formation of a government. But any decision on Bihar by the governor, Mr Buta Singh, or by the politicians, must be aimed at lifting the state from chaos.

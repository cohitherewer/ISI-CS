 GO SLOW

 It all depends on political will. After the initial fanfare of 2001, the government of West Bengal seems to have slowly lost the will to set up fast-track courts to ease the burden of pending cases. The state has one of the worst backlogs in the country, and it was hoped that the 152 fast-track courts to be set up under the scheme of the Centre would go a long way in clearing it. It could have been done. Fast-track courts had already begun to function successfully in Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh when West Bengal opened its first one at the end of 2001. The funding from the Centre was conditional upon equal response from the states. Soon, West Bengal?s tardiness in completing the scheme began to become evident. Although 53 such courts were functioning across the state by March 2003, this was really not good enough. By November the same year, the Supreme Court was ordering West Bengal and 11 other states to complete their quota of fast-track courts by December 31, or return the funds from the Centre. In spite of the sudden rush to complete the quota, the state government is now faced with the embarrassing prospect of having to return funds for 31 courts. It failed to meet the target.

 It might be asked, though, whether the government does feel embarrassed. It is quite in the habit of ignoring offerings of plenty when the scheme in question has nothing to do with its own mysterious plans. It is not interested, for example, to see that all the state?s children between 6 and 14 years of age are getting elementary education by 2010. Had it been serious about the programme, it would have managed to utilize fully the Rs 150 crore of Central funds that will now have to be returned if not used up by March 31. Presumably it is the same disinterest with fast-track courts. Blaming lack of infrastructure for the delay is not only to argue in a circle, it is also to say that West Bengal cannot do what all other states can. The condition of the justice system in the state is embarrassing in any case. There are not enough magistrates in the first place, and new appointments, the public is repeatedly told, are eternally delayed because there is no money. But the government has no problems in insisting on the controversial pre-litigation bill. That is where the question of political will comes in. Evidently, the government sees a better future for itself in shalishi courts rather than in fast-track courts.

 GRACELESS EXIT

 The position of Mr K. Natwar Singh, the minister for external affairs, had become untenable in the Union cabinet. By resigning, Mr Singh has only done what he should have done as soon as the Volcker report became public. The very fact that the government has decided to institute a judicial commission under Mr R.S. Pathak, a former chief justice of India, is evidence of the untenability of Mr Singh?s position. Under the circumstances, his defiance and his protestations were not cutting any ice. In fact, they made him look somewhat ridiculous. It is difficult to comprehend how he thought he could continue to command respect and credibility with the shadow of a judicial enquiry looming large over his reputation and integrity. The judicial probe comes close on the heels of the appointment of a special envoy to collect more details on the oil-for-food scandal, and Mr Singh?s alleged involvement in it. Mr Singh did not seem to recognize the embarrassment that he was causing the prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh. The prime minister has invested his honesty and rectitude in his political career. These assets were in danger of being sullied by the presence of Mr Singh in the cabinet. 

 It has been noted in these very columns that the crucial question does not relate to Mr Singh?s innocence or guilt in the face of the charges made in the Volcker report. The more relevant question is an ethical one. How can a person who has been named in a major international racket that was run by a tyrant continue to represent India in any international fora? Mr Singh is no longer above suspicion as he indeed should be as India?s foreign minister and as a senior politician. In fairness to the prime minister and to the Congress, Mr Singh should have stepped down in the immediate aftermath of the Volcker report. He did not do so. On the contrary, he stirred up an unseemly controversy which compromised the prime minister and the Congress. It should also be noted that both the prime minister and the Congress president, Ms Sonia Gandhi, by allowing Mr Singh?s ego to get the better of him, have allowed matters to slide for longer than was necessary. By letting him continue as minister without portfolio, they have shown their lack of firmness. It is true that politics has little to do with ethics. But there are occasions when being ethical is also good politics. This point could have been made by the prime minister and Mr Singh with a little more grace.

 HOW FAR UP THE PIPELINE?

R.C. ACHARYA

 Over the years, railway ministers ? bent on dispensing favours to their allies ? have promised a score of projects, most of which are financially unviable. These add up to nearly Rs 35,000 crore, and will take upto 20 years to be executed. 

 In 1998, Nitish Kumar blew the whistle on his erstwhile colleagues with his white paper on railway projects which went into the causes of the financial mess in the railways. Kumar told the Lok Sabha that almost 90 per cent of the projects sanctioned were un-remunerative and pleaded for the legislators? cooperation in prioritizing them. But blowing the whistle is one thing and restoring the health of the railways quite another.

 Taking a cue from the National Highway Yojana promoted by A.B. Vajpayee, Kumar put in place the Rail Vikas Yojana. It listed specific projects to create vital rail infrastructure with the objective of removing bottlenecks along the ?Golden Quadrilateral? ? Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta and Chennai. It also sought to provide connectivity to new ports and to strengthen old corridors, enabling the railways to capture the container traffic between these ports and the hinterland they serve.

 Chugging off

 To implement the Yojana, the Rail Vikas Nigam Limited was created on January 24, 2003 with the responsibility to mobilize resources and execute projects needed for the railways to grow. Even as the RVNL set about getting its act together, the mandarins in the railway board did not lose any time in handing over 56 projects, involving line capacity, port connectivity and four bridges. The assets after creation were to be transferred to the railways for operation and maintenance, though the RVNL would receive ?access? charges, providing it with a steady source of revenues.

 Ensuring a 14 per cent return is a vital criterion for the RVNL to take up a project. Accordingly, it has refused to take on four multi-crore bridges with very low returns. Also, in order to eliminate duplication of efforts, projects not yet taken up for execution by the zonal railways? construction organizations and the Central Organization for Railway Electrification, would now be taken up by the RVNL.

 The RVNL?s first task was to engage consultants to establish the ?bankability? of projects, restructure projects and develop new financing models. So far the response to private sector participation models has been good. Built-operate-transfer schemes have also generated adequate response from the private sectors.

 On track

 So far, the Asian Development Bank has approved 10 projects out of 14 submitted to it for technical, marketing, economic, financial, social and environmental examination. A viability study for the project, ?Upgradation of the Golden Quadrilateral and its diagonals for increasing the speed of freight trains to 100 kmph?, is under way. In this fiscal year, the RVNL must raise Rs 1,000 crore from the market ? mainly through the Indian Railway Finance Corporation. The ADB is also expected to provide Rs 400 crore and the railways will chip in with an equal amount as budgetary support.

 The Kutch Railway Company Limited, a special purpose vehicle with an equity of Rs 200 crore, is executing the much delayed Gandhidham-Palanpur Grand Chord, which is vital for boosting exports. Another SPV, the Hassan-Mangalore Rail Development Company Limited, is expected to ensure timely completion of gauge conversion. Discussions are also on with strategic partners for providing connectivity to ports like Krishnapatnam, Vallapadam, Dahej and Hazira. 

 Things seem to be finally moving in the right direction. Now, if only, the present and the later ministers do not throw them off the track.

 PLAYING IN THE DANGER ZONE

 SHOT IN THE DARK

 If London can think Karachi is unsafe, surely Milan can refuse to send its players to London after 7/7?

 It seems that the war to make the world a safer place to live is going horribly wrong. Suicide bombings had long become routine for Baghdad, Jerusalem or Kabul, they now find only a cursory mention in the global media now. But the London and Sharm el-Sheik bombings have shown that nowhere in the world is safe. 

 This is precisely the point that the London mayor, Ken Livingstone, was trying to make while criticizing the Italian Serie-A team Inter Milan?s initial decision to cancel their pre-season trip to England. He further commented that the terrorists must be jubilant at the decision because the result had vindicated their motive and it is an illusion to consider Milan to be less vulnerable to terrorist strikes than London. 

 Livingstone may have a point here, as various sporting events in the United Kingdom, such as the British Grand Prix, one-day cricket and the first Ashes test, the British Open golf championship, have managed to proceed without any disruption or postponement even as London was gripped by bomb scare. 

 Ironically, the first spate of bomb attacks took place on the same day that an England and Wales Cricket Board security team returned from Pakistan, where a scheduled test match in Karachi was cancelled owing to safety reasons following terror attacks in the region. The Pakistan Cricket Board?s request for an extra one-day international at the port city was also not entertained. The ECB is also worried about the security of the travelling ?Barmy Army?. The Karachi police, for one, have no reason to be disappointed. If the English sporting fans? reputation is anything to go by, the police must be heaving a sigh of relief that they will have to put up with the ?army? just for a day. 

 Taking the cue from the London mayor?s assertion that no place is safe in this age of global terrorism, one may ask why England refused to play a test or an extra one-dayer at Karachi? After all, London has lived in the shadow of terror for more than three decades of the Irish freedom movement, when bombings and explosions were the norm rather than exception. If there is no reason to cancel a test match at Lord?s even as the second round of explosions take place in London, why fear for the English team?s safety in Karachi, where security would, under normal circumstances, be more stringent than at Lord?s? 

 In fact, cricketers have never been harmed in any terrorist attack on Karachi. The one instance when cricketers had a close shave was when a suicide bomb exploded outside the Sheraton hotel where the New Zealand team had been put up. But the attack was not aimed at the Kiwis, it was a protest against the use of the Karachi Airport by the Western powers in their ?war against terror.? 

 The English fear in the case of Karachi may still be explained in terms of the state?s concern for its citizens. Even the Indians, during their tour of Pakistan, refused to play a test match in Karachi, while the Pakistanis stayed off Ahmedabad, when it was their turn to visit India. Inter Milan too had reasons to initially cancel their tour: it had players worth millions of dollars to think of. If the London mayor puts things in context, he ought to understand the Italian club?s decision. The Tourism Industry Emergency Response , an industry group, has contended that spending by overseas visitors could be well below expectations in 2005 and even weekend travel to London from Europe and other parts of Britain is down by 7 per cent since 7/7. So why blame the Italians, when the British themselves are preferring to shut themselves up in their homes? 

 The spectre of terrorism looms too large on the West for it to complain about security arrangements in Asian countries. How does it feel to be paid back in your own coin, Mr Livingstone?

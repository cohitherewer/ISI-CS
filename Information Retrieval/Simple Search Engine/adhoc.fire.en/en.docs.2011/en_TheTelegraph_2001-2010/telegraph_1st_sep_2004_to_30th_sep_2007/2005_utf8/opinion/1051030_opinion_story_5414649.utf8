 COOCH BEHAR BURNING 

 - The struggle threatens to intensify in November 

 The Greater Cooch Behar Peoples Association is spearheading a campaign for a separate state. It is gearing up for the next phase of its campaign ? which could include self-immolation, reports Debashis Bhattacharyya

 Banshi Badan Barman relates easily to Upen, the peasant who has his land usurped by a landlord in Rabindranath Tagores poem, Dui Bigha Jami. In fact, in Upen, victim of feudal land grabbing, the leader of the Greater Cooch Behar movement sees the mirror image of the Rajbanshi ? a largely impoverished ethnic community that numerically dominates much of north Bengal. 

 Barman ? himself a Rajbanshi who studied Bengali literature in college ? has read the poem again and again since his school days. It has always inspired me, says the 36-year-old general secretary of the Greater Cooch Behar Peoples Association, spearheading a campaign for a separate Cooch Behar state. The movement has so far claimed five lives ? two activists killed in police firing and three policemen lynched by a mob. 

 The struggle threatens to intensify in November, as activists plan the next step of their campaign. Men and women, leaders say, are gearing up to sacrifice themselves if the government pays no heed to their demand. It could be self-immolation just outside the district magistrates office, a movement leader says. 

 Trouble has been brewing in the north Bengal town for a while now. On September 20, crowds turned violent at Khagrabari, barely three km from the district headquarters, when police carried out a baton charge. The crowds pelted the police with stones, and the police opened fire, killing two villagers. As the word spread, a mob, held back by the police at Chakchaka, ripped down a barricade and lynched three policemen, including an additional superintendent of police. 

 The violence ? which made the state administration sit up ? seems to have fired up the demonstrators. All of Cooch Behar is in the grips of a frenzied movement, with vendors in several weekly markets refusing to pay the haat tax the government collects from them, officials say. In many areas, they are even refusing to pay bus fares and boat fares. At the core of the struggle is land ? an issue that Tagore wrote about in his poem. Like the zamindar who took away Upens two bighas of land, the Bengal government has taken away our state, reducing it to a district, says Barman. 

 In the beginning 

 And that, in a nutshell, is what the movement is all about. A princely state, governed by a succession of 21 kings known as Koch rulers since the beginning of the 16th century, Cooch Behar merged into India in September 1949. Four months later, it became part of Bengal. Maharani Gayatri Devi of Jaipur ? arguably the most prominent descendant of the royal family ? makes it a point to visit Cooch Behar at least once a year. 

 The demonstrators ? citing a clause in the merger agreement signed by the government of India and Maharaja Jagaddipendranarayan, the last independent king ? want Union Territory status for Cooch Behar, which, they feel, will eventually pave the way for a state. 

 One of the issues is also a fund of more than Rs 1.50 crore left by the royals for the development of Cooch Behar. Most of it remains in fixed deposits in banks, generating interest spent by MLAs from the district for development. The Greater Cooch Behar Peoples Association wants the funds handed over to the people, saying the money lawfully belongs to them. 

 Underdevelopment has always fuelled separatist movements and Cooch Behar is no exception. In the last 50 years, Bengal has not done anything for Cooch Behar. Its one of the most backward districts in the state, Barman says. 

 His village Jarabari, for example, has no tarred roads or electricity even though its barely five kilometres from the subdivisional town of Dinhata. 

 Not surprisingly, demands for a separate state have been raised off and on in Cooch Behar since the 1950s. But ne-ver has the movement captured the popular imagination to such an extent ? or evoked such passion ? as it has today, judging by the crowds it has been drawing across the district bordering Assam and Bangladesh. 

 Feelings are running so high that many ? in the administration or in political circles ? find it hard to speak out against the movement. The Greater Cooch Behar leaders are promising the moon to the people, such as giving government jobs to everybody once a state is formed. This is impractical, but you cant publicly say all this keeping in mind the local sensibilities, says Hiten Nag, a Forward Bloc ideologue and a retired professor of Dinhata College. 

 There are rumblings all around. The staff at the imposing Cooch Behar palace fear that it may be stormed by the people. The locals are saying its their kings palace, so its their property, says Ratan Das, a conservation assistant at the Archeological Survey of India (ASI), overseeing the upkeep of the palace, a tourist attraction. 

 On July 18, during an earlier demonstration at the district headquarters, Das says they were forced to throw open the gates as hundreds of people demanded to enter the palace without buying tickets to see for themselves what the kings had left them. ASI officials are especially worried about old weapons, used by the kings and their generals, stored in the palace. 

 The agitators have their strategy, but Barman is not yet ready to divulge it. The Union home ministry, in a response to a letter the movement leaders had written to President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, has promised to send a high-level team for a spot review in early November. Barman warns that they might be prompted to do something drastic if the team does not turn up. We are not going to sit and watch, he says. 

 Undoubtedly, the movement portends trouble for West Bengals ruling Left Front, which is preparing for state Assembly elections early next year. A concerned chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has asked the district administration to speed up development projects. 

 The campaign came as a shock to the Front, which had clearly failed to recognise and settle the desia-bhatia divide that has long split the north Bengal society. The Rajbanshis, who call themselves desia or indigenous people, harbour deep grievances against the bhatias or the Bengali refugees from Bangladesh who settled and prospered in Cooch Behar and its neighbouring districts. 

 The resentment has historical roots. Anandagopal Ghosh, who teaches history at North Bengal University in Siliguri, says that the kings of Cooch Behar were largely benevolent and the Rajbanshis were a happy lot, with many of them owning vast tracts of farmland. Things began to change once the state merged into India and the subjects lost whatever privileges they enjoyed under the Koch rulers. 

 And then came the flood of refugees. These simple Rajbanshis, many of whom had become indolent, could not compete with the hard-working Bengali refugees, who slowly bought their land and drove them out of business, Ghosh says. 

 Future tense

 It was only a matter of time before the Rajbanshi landlords became labourers, a view endorsed by Nirmal Das, a retired professor of Rabindra Bharati University in Calcutta and author of several books on the Rajbanshi language, Kamtapuri ? a dialect of Bengali. These former landlords are behind todays Greater Cooch Behar movement, says Das. 

 The rebel: Banshi Badan Barman 

Against this historical backdrop, its hardly surprising that statehood movements keep popping up in north Bengal. If it was the Uttarkhand agitation in the late Sixties and the Kamtapuri movement in the Nineties, its Greater Cooch Behar today. 

 Cooch Behar zilla parishad sabhadhipati Ananta Roy, a senior CPI(M) leader, says underdevelopment is not behind the demand for statehood. He says the Left Front government has distributed land among 1.28 lakh landless families in the district under its land reform programmes. The majority of the beneficiaries are Rajbanshis, says Roy, a Rajbanshi. Most MLAs, MPs and other political functionaries from the region, Roy stresses, are Rajbanshi. I fail to understand how the Rajbanshis can harbour such grievances. 

 Yet the CPI(M) acknowledges that the Rajbanshis are increasingly trying to affirm their ethnic identity through statehood movements. Its never just underdevelopment, but the question of their cultural and linguistic identities that dominated the Kamtapuri movement, says Pintu Ganguly, president of the CPI(M)s peasant wing in Kumargram in the neighbouring Jalpaiguri district. 

 But its not easy to sustain such movements, as Madhusudan Das or Tarzan, a former militant of Kamtapuri Liberation Organisation (KLO), has learnt to his cost. Hounded by the police and paramilitary forces, in 2001 Das turned himself in, tired of a life on the run. He says the Kamtapuri movement is all but over, with Bhutan flushing out KLO militants two years ago. 

 I dont see much future for this Greater Cooch Behar movement either, says the disillusioned 32-year-old ex-militant. But Banshi Badan Barman clings to what he believes should be done. And its not just about Cooch Behar, but about his favourite poem. Given a chance, he would have had the poem rewritten and reunited Upen with his land.

 PAST AND PRESENT

 Calcutta has been called a living city. It has, just as often, been called a dying city. All marvellous old cities exist like this ? between sinking and rising, continuity and change, the past and the present. Witness Venice, Alexandria or Dresden. With World Heritage Day passing Calcutta by yesterday with scarcely a civic murmur, it makes sense to look again at the city?s attitudes to its past. It is symbolic that yesterday?s most publicized event in the city was the consecration of a colonial cemetery as a heritage site. Urban heritage is not just a concept or a value. It is also a material reality, made up of real spaces and structures that are subject to time and gravity. Hence, ?preserving? Calcutta?s heritage has to be the result as much of thinking and valuing, of working out concepts and attitudes, as of certain specialized material and technical skills. What must be clearly thought out is how the traces of the past are to be valued. Will the criterion be beauty or significance, aesthetics or history? And what about utility? At the material level, everything from conservation, pollution control, urban planning and architecture to curatorship and the management of funds and publicity make up the relevant skills. And all this informed by learning, intelligence, good taste and good sense.

 What Calcutta?s citizens and its various civic and municipal authorities first need to learn is that heritage is serious business. It cannot be reduced to pride, sentimentality, nostalgia or political fanfare. It is not only a question of funds and infrastructure, but also of various forms of civic and technical education. This is a matter of skills as well as awareness, involving properly informed politicians and bureaucrats, enlightened funders, trained specialists and managers, and ? just as important ? conscious and conscientious citizens. Another mindset that is inimical to intelligent conservation is an ignorant, short-sighted and vulgar bedazzlement with certain notions of urban modernity ? the Flyovers-and-Malls Syndrome. This is as much the result of cluelessness and bad taste as of greed and corruption in the name of urban development and regeneration. Feeling fond of the Metropolitan Building, or planning an exhaustive heritage directory, or perking up the state heritage commission is all very well. But what Calcutta needs most is a great deal of hard thinking on this matter, and the acquisition of specialized skills.

 Harsh truths

 Sir ? Now that two highest constitutional functionaries of the country ? the president and the new chief justice of India ? have lent their voice against the death penalty, they must have made the anti-capital punishment lobby very happy (?Should the death penalty be abolished??, Nov 2). In this context, the passionate avowal of the death penalty by the just-retired chief justice of India, R.C. Lahoti, must have struck many as odd (?Sign-off seal on death stick?, Nov 1). The forgiving lot never tire of explaining how brutal and inhuman the act of hanging is, and they even plead for the clemency of paedophile rapists. Yet talking of the reform and rehabilitation of such criminals cannot but be blasphemy in our country. Any punishment other than hanging will let these criminals out of prison within a few years. Hardened and experienced, they will then take a heavier toll on society. The probability of a convict?s repentance and reformation is so little that it is economically unviable to let all of them live. The society is concerned with the overall well-being of its people. To make social garbage survive at the cost of the tax-paying public cannot be a social priority. Human rights activists, both in our country and outside, are a bizarre lot. They keep mum when militants kill hundreds, and spring to action only when one of them is sent to the gallows. How can ?human rights? be enjoyed without a corresponding rider, any fine print, or any accompanying duty?

 Yours faithfully,

Chameli Pal, Batanagar

 Sir ? The death penalty awarded to Mohammad Arif, the Lashkar-e-Toiba terrorist, in the Red Fort attack case is justified. The thought of going to the gallows will, hopefully, send a chill down the spine of others who may be harbouring the thought of getting away with a life term for committing similar crimes. The opinion of the former chief justice of India, R.C. Lahoti ? that the death penalty should be retained in the Indian Penal Code is most welcome, coming as it does after the New Delhi blasts. When cold-blooded murders are committed against humanity, there can be no alternative to capital punishment. Our legal system should take into account the conditions prevailing in the country and should desist from abolishing the death penalty outright just because some other countries have done so. Looking at the growing crime graph, one should in fact think hard about how prudent it is to abolish the death penalty without any existing alternative that can act as a deterrent. The best we can do is think of a less medieval way to implement the prescribed capital punishment.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Barthakur, Guwahati

 Sir ? R.C. Lahoti was absolutely right in noting that India has no national policy to combat the growing menace of terrorism. The attack on the parliament, the Red Fort and, more recently, the blasts in Delhi on the eve of one of the biggest festivals in India, have shown that India has become the playground of terrorists belonging to a particular religion. Despite this, our legislators seem to be falling head over heels to appease the community and turn a blind eye to the rampant infiltration on the western and eastern borders of the country. Why do we have no policy to expel the families and close relations of those who commit dastardly acts here? Take Dawood Ibrahim?s mother and sister for example, who continue to live in India. No wonder our intelligence agencies are such a confused lot, not knowing who their enemies are. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shivaji K. Moitra, Calcutta

 Sir ? The Indian government has no political will to tackle terrorism. The truth is that many political parties and their leaders bank on Muslim votes in this country. They are under the wrong impression that in case they take stern action against Pakistan-sponsored terrorism, they will stand to lose Muslim votes. Pakistan understands the psychology and is making the most of this weakness. In 1962, when China invaded India, Jawaharlal Nehru had said, ?Freedom is in peril; defend it with all your might?. Today, for our spineless political leaders, it is ?votes are in peril, defend them with all your might?. When the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam assassinated Rajiv Gandhi, its chief, V. Prabhakaran, offered to ?cooperate? with the Indian government to nab the culprits. Pervez Musharaff?s extending a helping hand to the Indian government after the blasts is very similar to Prabhakaran?s offer.

 Yours faithfully,

Harischandra Parasuram, Mumbai 

 Sir ? Currently, there is a debate raging in the country over the inhumanity of the death penalty. Human rights group, NGOs and a section of the intelligentsia feel strongly about the human aspect of the penalty and argue vociferously in favour of its abolition. There are usually two arguments for this. One, that no one has the right to take the life of another human being. Two, that death penalty has not deterred anyone from the act of murder. Two eminent persons in this country have also joined the plea. I, as an ordinary citizen, would like to ask them a simple question. If the interpreters of the Constitution or judges of the country?s law courts do not have the right to pass a death penalty, how is it that a city magistrate or any police official present at the scene of violence can order firing on a crowd which, more often than not, results in the death of the persons involved and innocent bystanders? How can officials of the state be given the right to kill human beings for crimes which perhaps do not deserve a death penalty while those who, after careful examination of witnesses and evidence, are seen to commit the most heinous of crimes? If death penalty is abolished, let shoot-at-sight orders be consigned to the same fate.

 Yours faithfully,

S.B. Gupta, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Nothing pleased me more than the news of Ashfaq Ahmed and Mohammad Arif being awarded the death sentence for the Red Fort shootout. If Arif?s fellow jihadis are thinking of a counter-attack again, India is ready for them.

 Yours faithfully,

Pramit Das, Jamshedpur

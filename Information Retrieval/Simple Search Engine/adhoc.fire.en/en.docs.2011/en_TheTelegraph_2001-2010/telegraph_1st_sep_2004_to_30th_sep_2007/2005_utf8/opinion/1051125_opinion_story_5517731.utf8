 REAL PEACE

 Successful peacemakers must be realists first. It is unrealistic to expect the army to suspend its operations against the United Liberation Front of Asom even before a substantive peace process has begun. Making any such demand at this stage, as the committee set up by the Ulfa to talk to New Delhi has done, will not help the cause of peace in Assam. The team had just one meeting with the Centre?s representatives. Even the preliminaries for a dialogue with the Ulfa?s top leadership have not yet been worked out. It is not certain if the team?s talks with the government will eventually lead to the Ulfa leaders joining the peace table. On the other hand, there are indications of some groups within the Ulfa being opposed to any peace overtures. One such group openly opposed the peace move and threatened to ?carry on the fight against the security forces?. Time clearly is not ripe for the army suspending its counter-insurgency battles. The Ulfa-appointed team could justifiably cry foul over any excesses committed by the army. But to ask for the suspension of the army operations will create avoidable confusions. 

 The important thing is to build an atmosphere of trust between the two sides. The government and the rebels agreed on the team?s mediation without insisting on a ceasefire first. The next logical step would be to move toward a ceasefire. But the government needs to be assured that the rebels would not misuse the ceasefire to regroup and re-arm. More important, time for considering a halt to the army operations would come only after the Ulfa leaders themselves join the peace talks. True, the army would do well to restrain itself so that the current initiative is not wasted. There is no denying that mutual mistrust and suspicion had sometimes led the army or other forces to overreact with tragic consequences. But the Ulfa?s peacemakers need to remember one thing. They may have been appointed by the Ulfa, but they also represent the Assamese people?s hope for an end to violence. Peace in Assam is not an issue merely between the Ulfa and the governments in New Delhi and Dispur. Ultimately, it is a matter of life and death for the state?s common people.

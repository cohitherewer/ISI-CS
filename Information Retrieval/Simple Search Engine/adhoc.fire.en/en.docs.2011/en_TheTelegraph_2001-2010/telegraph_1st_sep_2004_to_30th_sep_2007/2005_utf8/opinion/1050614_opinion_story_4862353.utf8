 NEVER PROPERLY CHECKED

 Malvika Singh

 With the mercury soaring, tempers too are rising and there is much anger about the manner in which wrongdoings are condoned and how illegitimate actions are seen to be legitimate because the mighty are never brought to book. Honest people who abide by archaic and colonial laws are perpetually harassed because they refuse to lie and pay off the authority. This comment of mine sounds so convoluted but it is so true and typical of a country that is ruled by illegitimacy, by extortion and corruption and by redundant rules and norms. 

 If you are a director on the board of a company and the company accountant signs a post-dated cheque for a year or two hence, and the company collapses over that period of time (and everyone does not do business by consulting astrologers who tell the future), and the cheque bounces, you have indulged in a criminal offence, one you are not in control of. Hundreds of cheques are issued by any and every company everyday?how are ?directors? supposed to know? Instead of the government banning post-dated cheques, harassment of directors continues unabated. However, if you break the law knowingly and with zero remorse, you get away. 

 Beastly tale

 If you shoot a schedule one animal, the judge will allow you to get away if you are smart enough to do so. Or, he will be compassionate and give you extended time. If you rape a woman you get immediate bail. For real crimes, everything is ?alleged?. Everyone is watching, everyone is laughing, everyone knows that the real culprits in this country will get away and everyone has decided to beat the law and bribe their way through life like their ?heroes? of the privileged classes. Examples such as these compel average, seemingly honest people to consciously break rules and laws to make their lives simple and unencumbered by paying off the Indian Harassment Service. This is the problem Manmohan Singh needs to address and solve post haste.

 If you are fed with the values of honesty and integrity from the time you are in an Indian womb, life in India is impossible. If you do not bribe the electricity linesman, he cuts your power supply or fiddles with your meter. If you want to set up a small hotel or a restaurant, you have to spend your creative time looking for and filling in proformas, applications and more forms pleading for permissions to be honest. The authority on the other side of the table will harass you till you are on the verge of a breakdown. Most normal humans give up and find the bribe technique easier. 

 Beyond the lawful

 If you are starting a restaurant, you will soon have to face the corrupt brigade of those in the excise department who issue the bar licence. They will arrive in hordes, drink and eat free, take their bribe and keep you hopping for some more to accelerate the process. In a legitimate country, a non-banana republic, this licence should be given in fifteen minutes. Come on ?leaders?, show your paces. Then come the band of chaps who check whether the ingredients that are being used are adulterated. Another farce. What is not adulterated in India? Everything in a sealed packet is adulterated. We all know it. We have to live with the poison. We do not need the authority to tell us we are wrong. They are wrong. Many of us have begun to grow our own food. The water that governments supply is adul terated. 

 Should the authority be arrested according to the adulteration law? Yes. Those who rule India should set the standards first and then enforce their silly laws that are designed specially to aid corruption and allow those who enforce the law to make undeclared black bucks (pun not intended). A perfect example of the lawmaker being the law breaker.

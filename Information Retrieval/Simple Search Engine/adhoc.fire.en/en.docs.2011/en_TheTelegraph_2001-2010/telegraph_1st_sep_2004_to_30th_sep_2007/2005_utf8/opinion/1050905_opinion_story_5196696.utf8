 EXPAND THE DIALOGUE ON KASHMIR

TWENTY-TWENTY - BHARAT BHUSHAN

 The table is for sharing

 Up to a few weeks ago, the government had no plans to meet the All Party Hurriyat Conference. After the Pugwash Conference in Kathmandu last year, some Hurriyat leaders had wanted to meet the prime minister quietly. It was clear that his advisors did not want that. It was also evident that they did not have an alternate political plan to address the Kashmir issue at the time. 

 Now, suddenly, and apparently under the influence of a Congress chief ministerial wannabe, Saifuddin Soz, the Hurriyat has been called for an audience with the prime minister. But there is still no indication of what bold steps the prime minister wants to take after he has heard the Hurriyat out. 

 There is nothing that the Hurriyat can say which the prime minister does not already know. He ought to know that the Hurriyat has very little street credibility, being little more than the mouthpiece of Pakistan today. By inviting only the Hurriyat, New Delhi has given it credibility while alienating other Kashmiri leaders like Yasin Malik, Sajjad Lone and Shabir Shah. Unless an invitation also follows to them, soon, they will be pushed towards adopting a harder line.

 There can only be a limited number of reasons for holding a dialogue with the Hurriyat. One can only speculate on what the objectives of the government are. 

 The government cannot hope to resolve the Kashmir issue by discussing the options of independence, autonomy or joint sovereignty of Kashmir with the Hurriyat. The Hurriyat is not in a position to implement its understanding with New Delhi on any one of these scenarios on the ground. 

 It also cannot be the government?s case that talking with the Hurriyat will lead to ending militancy. The Hurriyat does not control any of the major groups like the Hizbul Mujahedin, Lashkar-e-Toiba and others responsible for militancy in Kashmir.

 If the government hopes to find a solution to the Kashmir issue with the cooperation of the Hurriyat within the Indian Constitution, then there are no signs of the Hurriyat?s willingness to do so. Its leadership is known to flare up whenever they hear any reference to the Indian Constitution. 

 Perhaps the government wants to persuade the Hurriyat to find a solution within the Indian Union without referring to the Constitution. However. It is doubtful whether the Hurriyat leaders can be persuaded to jettison Pakistan to arrive at a political settlement with India. This would involve convincing them to participate in the elections, come to power in Jammu and Kashmir and then settle for whatever they agree on. If the Hurriyat went along with this, its leaders would lose their source of funds and those arguing for Kashmiris solving their issues without Pakistan?s mediation may get assassinated as Abdul Ghani Lone did. 

 There is yet another possibility ? that the government could have decided to talk to the Hurriyat entirely for domestic reasons ? such as its impact on the Bihar assembly elections and wooing of the Muslim vote there. The Congress has been trying to attract the Muslim vote through five percent job reservations in Andhra Pradesh and 50 per cent reservation for Muslim students in Aligarh Muslim University. It would be good to be seen to be engaging with the ?Muslim problem? in Jammu and Kashmir before the elections.

 An additional reason could be that the National Democratic Alliance had two rounds of talks with the Hurriyat and continuing the dialogue will present this government as no less competent than the NDA. By taking the dialogue a notch up ? with the prime minister instead of the home minister, they could indicate that the dialogue was going further.

 Or, could it be that the prime minister wants to meet the Hurriyat purely as a public relations exercise? India has to talk to Hurriyat sooner or later as they have become an international symbol of Kashmiri separatism. On the eve of his visit to the United Nations general assembly, the prime minister may want a photo opportunity with the Hurriyat to show the United States of America, Pakistan and the international community that India is alive to a dialogue to resolve the Kashmir issue. 

 The most probable scenario is that the government wants to wean the Hurriyat away from Pakistan, encourage them to participate in the elections and explore possibilities of greater autonomy by modifying the Constitution. If that is the case, then the Hurriyat demands and the government?s response should have been rehearsed by now, leaving nothing to chance.

 If, however, it is only a public relations exercise to show the prime minister and India in a good light in New York later this month without conceding much on the ground, then such cynical manipulation of the Kashmiris needs to be condemned. 

 Nothing is fully governable in politics. A big embarrassment can arise for the prime minister if the Hurriyat leaders are encouraged by Pakistan to claim that by inviting the Hurriyat, New Delhi has finally accepted the Kashmiri people as the third party to the dispute. 

 The only way the prime minister can get some mileage from the meeting with the Hurriyat is if he is contrite about what has happened in Kashmir; admit that mistakes have been made in the past and that the people have suffered.

 He should admit that the Kashmir problem can be solved only with the participation of the people. Inviting participation does not make the Kashmiris a third party to the dispute between India and Pakistan. While the issue remains bilateral, anyone acceptable to the two sides can contribute to resolving it. The US, for example, is not a party to the dispute but it can participate and contribute to resolve it. The prime minister can then get over the third party issue. 

 If the government is not cynical about engaging the Kashmiris, then having made this overture, the dialogue must be broad-based. Discussions must also be held with other moderate separatist leaders as well as the leaders of the ?constitutional? Kashmiri political parties. They also represent Kashmiri aspirations.

 This discussion must be conducted through a formal Track-II process with representation of all the institutions of the government engaged with Kashmir ? from the home ministry to the Planning Commission and the ministry of external affairs ? leaving out freelance operatives, however well intentioned they might be. What the freelancers do can feed into the process informally but the Kashmiris should not be confused by too many people landing in Srinagar claiming to be New Delhi?s emissaries. The official process of interaction with the Kashmiris must continue quietly, without press briefings and without any attempt to score political points at the cost of the Kashmiris. 

 It is this process then which can become the backbone of a political dialogue with the Kashmiri leaders. Even if things go wrong at the political level, the dialogue can be salvaged and nurtured by officials in the Track-II. 

 The prime minister should use the opportunity of meeting the first set of Kashmiri separatist leaders from the Hurriyat to set this broad-based permanent process in motion. Appointing yet another interlocutor, setting up yet another committee to look into Kashmir?s development or a symbolic release of a few prisoners is unlikely to assuage the Kashmiris.

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the WHO?s revised international health regulations, adopted at the World Health Assembly, May 16, 2005

 Article 11: WHO shall send to all States Parties and, as appropriate, to relevant intergovernmental organizations, as soon as possible and by the most efficient means available, in confidence, such public health information which it has received and which is necessary to enable States Parties to respond to a public health risk. WHO should communicate information to other States Parties that might help them in preventing the occurrence of similar incidents. 

 WHO shall use information received for verification, assessment and assistance purposes and, unless otherwise agreed with the States Parties, shall not make this information generally available to other States Parties, until such time as: 

 (a) the event is determined to constitute a public health emergency of international concern or 

 (b) information evidencing the international spread of the infection or contamination has been confirmed by WHO; or 

 (c) there is evidence that: 

 (i) control measures against the international spread are unlikely to succeed because of the nature of the contamination, disease agent, vector or reservoir; or 

 (ii) the State Party lacks sufficient operational capacity to carry out necessary measures to prevent further spread of disease; or 

 (d) the nature and scope of the international movement of travellers, baggage, cargo, containers, conveyance, goods or postal parcels that may be affected by the infection or contamination requires the immediate application of international control measures. 

 WHO shall consult with the State Party in whose territory the event is occurring as to its intent to make information available. 

 When information received by WHO is made available to States Parties, WHO may also make it available to the public if other information about the same event has already become publicly available and there is a need for the dissemination of authoritative and independent information. 

 Article 12: The Director-General shall determine, on the basis of the information received, whether an event constitutes a public health emergency of international concern. 

 2. If the Director-General considers... that a public health emergency of international concern is occurring, he shall consult with the State Party in whose territory the event arises regarding this preliminary determination. If the Director- General and the State Party are in agreement regarding this determination, the Director-General shall... seek the views of the... Emergency Committee on appropriate temporary recommendations.

 Letters to Editor

 Living together

 Sir ? The Supreme Court has upheld the right of a cooperative society in Mumbai to have Parsi members only (?One-community housing lawful? April 19). Of course, the decree abides by the letter of the Constitution. But the verdict may have the unfortunate result of legitimizing the subtle discrimination prevalent in housing societies. But we need laws which encourage mixed localities. More so, in the light of the recent communal riots when one finds that housing societies and even promoters are refusing to sell houses to members of ?other? communities. Religion- and caste-based areas or housing colonies are increasingly coming into existence. The increasing ghettoization of the Muslim minority and the creation of ?mini Pakistans? in the wake of the Gujarat carnage are a manifestation of this. What such polarizations do is hamper the integration of all Indians into a national community. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Ram Puniyani, Powai 

 Old tricks

 Sir ? It is well known that the Bharatiya Janata Party lost power at the Centre because its claim of being a ?party with a difference? was proved to be false. If anything, corruption rose under the BJP dispensation, and even Atal Bihari Vajpayee came under suspicion for the activities of his son-in-law. The failure of the party?s second-rung leadership was evident when L.K. Advani had to be recalled to take up the party presidency. Sadly, the BJP has failed to rise to the aspirations of its mentor, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. The sarsanghchalak, K.S. Sudarshan, is right to compare Vajpayee unfavourably with Congress prime ministers, Indira Gandhi and P.V. Narasimha Rao, saying that the latter did a better job of safeguarding the interests of the majority community. India definitely needs parties driven by ideology and led by young people, instead of those with the simple aim to capture power for personal gain. 

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Delhi

 Sir ? It is always better to make way for the next generation and leave people saying, ?why now?, rather than, ?why not? (?Art of speech?, April 21). At the same time, a truly democratic party is bound to have problems of succession. Unlike the Congress, where a Gandhi tag is all that?s needed to get ahead, other parties usually have a tussle at the top and ultimately, the fittest survives. The strain becomes even more evident when the party has had a successful run in the recent past. All said and done, let democratic India have tussles for succession rather than simple sycophancy and lineage ruling the roost.

 Yours faithfully,

Bedashruti Mitra, Raigarh 

 Sir ? The media is making much of K.S. Sudarshan?s candour with an eye to destabilizing the sangh parivar. Of course, the RSS chief should be congratulated for calling a spade a spade ? the reputation of A.B. Vajpayee and L.K. Advani did not match their record as prime minister and Union home minister respectively. But that does not mean that their potential to keep promises was affected by their advancing age. 

 As for age, in many cases, it has proved an advantage. Recall Morarji Desai. If health is maintained, old age does not impede potential or initiative. Besides, the leadership provided by the duo is of paramount importance in this critical phase in the history of the party and the country.

 Yours faithfully,

Balram Misra, New Delhi

 Sir ? ?Old is gold?, the BJP can no more protest ? the criticism has come from within the family itself this time. But the RSS chief?s remarks against the ?big two? are nothing new. What he has said in public was whispered behind closed doors in the party for a long time but no one uttered dared to utter it aloud. Then why is K.S. Sudarshan suddenly being targeted? But there is a twist in the plot ? now the BJP is trying to hold on to Vajpayee for some ?marg darshan?. The contradictions of the party only prove that old or young is not the issue. The party needs to look again at the core issues it stands on since there are many Sudarshans waiting to pull down its top leaders.

 Yours faithfully,

Rashmi Jaiswal, Howrah

 Sir ? How can Atal Bihari Vajpayee say that he does not hold any post when he is an elected member of parliament, representing the people of his constituency in the Lok Sabha? With his memory badly weakened and his inability to even walk properly, his retirement, even from parliament, is long over due. An upper age-limit for politicians and legislators can remove many evils of our system. It would induce the youth to manage the affairs of the nation, and eliminate dynastic politics and also check corruption. 

 Yours faithfully,

S.C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir ? A.B. Vajpayee?s ?googlies? are nothing new. Just last year, he openly criticized Narendra Modi for being the major reason for the BJP?s debacle in the Lok Sabha elections. A few days later, he said he had been ?misinterpreted? by the media. It is natural of politicians to blame the media when they see their words boomerang on them. This may be hypocrisy, or it may be that Vajpayee acts on impulse. Which is strange because from his slow speeches, one gets the feeling that he thinks something through thoroughly before giving voice it. 

 Yours faithfully,

Mrinal Sinha, Dhanbad

 Sir ? Atal Bihari Vajpayee?s verbal somersaults are a common sign of old age. In fact, all old politicians should retire and give way to younger ones, whichever party they may belong to.

 Yours faithfully,

B.S. Ganesh, Bangalore

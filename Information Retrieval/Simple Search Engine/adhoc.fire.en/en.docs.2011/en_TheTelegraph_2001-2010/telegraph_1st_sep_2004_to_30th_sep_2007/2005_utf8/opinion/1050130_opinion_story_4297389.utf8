 Letters to Editor

 Rest in peace

 Sir ? On Netaji?s birthday, a politician was heard saying that Bose might still be alive. However, considering the dangerous life he led, it is unlikely that Bose would live to be 108 today. And haven?t the numerous inquiries proved that he died in the aircrash? The myth that Bose survived fuels an entire industry ? conspiracy theorists, filmmakers and politicians. Little wonder then that they refuse to let him die lest it takes away a lucrative livelihood.

Yours faithfully, 

Debashish Ghosh, Calcutta

Not straight enough 

Sir ? The editorial, ?What is the line??, (Jan 20), 

says that Manmohan Singh?s condemnation of same-sex marriages echoes the National 

Democratic Alliance government?s refusal to repeal Article 377 of the Indian Penal 

Code. This is not true. Instead, Singh?s view reflects our society?s discomfiture 

with homosexuality. Article 377 of the IPC does not criminalize homosexuals alone. 

Anyone indulging in sexual activities ?against the order of nature? is likely 

to be penalized. 

As for gay marriages, there are legal hurdles which make it difficult to legalize it ? for instance the issue of inheritance and property rights of the couple. These problems have made gay marriages controversial even in liberal societies. Singh?s statement does not augur well for a country which has a burgeoning HIV population. But it is unlikely that the National AIDS Control Organization headed by the prime minister would discriminate against homosexuals in its bid to fight the epidemic.

Yours faithfully, 

Moni Nag, New York 

Sir ? Paul Martin is Canada?s ?prime minister? and 

not ?premier? as the report, ?Umm... what same sex??(Jan, 19) says. A premier 

in Canada is the elected head of a ?province? and is the equivalent of a chief 

minister in India. The report also mentions that gay marriages would be ?civil 

affairs? and not ?religious? ones. But a number of religious bodies in Canada 

are not opposed to these. The law only requires that religious bodies cannot be 

forced to consecrate such unions if they choose not to. 

Why India is not ready to accept homosexual marriage is difficult to fathom. Perhaps it has less to do with culture and more to do with keeping the influential and equally conservative Indian diaspora happy. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shyamal Bagchee, Edmonton, Canada

 Sir ?The question that many Indians would have liked to ask Manmohan Singh was eventually raised by a foreign journalist. Sadly, Singh?s response to same-sex marriage left a lot to be desired. It is true that homosexuality is taboo in India. But shouldn?t a mature democracy respect the rights of the sexual minorities as well? Those who oppose gay marriages for being ?harmful? to society have not been able to prove their claim conclusively. Worse, discrimination against sexual minorities prevents them from realizing their potential and contributing to the development of society. Perhaps, Singh needs to think of instituting reforms that would make Indian society a more equal place for gays.

 Yours faithfully,

Pawan Dhall, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir ? Contrary to what Soham Gupta says in his letter (Jan 25,) the Pokemon series do not depict violence. It is more about friendship and trust between man and animals ? something which can make our world a better place. Those who criticize this series should watch the show before commenting.

 Yours faithfully,

Pujashree Acharya, Duliajan, Assam

 IN LAW

 The law of the land is exactly that: the law of the land. The decision of the highest court of the land may overrule the decisions of all other courts within the territory, but it means nothing beyond that boundary. The apparently simple understanding loses its sharp, self-evident edges in an age in which people are mobile, shifting their places of residence from one end of the earth to another for work or marriage. The Supreme Court of India wishes to hear the opinion of two minors on their choice of guardian, when their father is in the United States of America and their deceased mother?s parents in India. The mother of the children, who was the granddaughter of the former chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, N.T. Rama Rao, had committed suicide. A Chennai court had charged her husband with abetment, and the maternal grandparents want to bring the children away from the alleged abettor. But a US family court has forbidden this in order to protect the children of the non-resident Indian from emotional disturbance. The US court feels that ?they should not be thrust into a lawsuit commenced for their custody by maternal relatives in India?. Each court is functioning as it should within its own territory, but their orders are irreconcilable. The deadlock is inevitable; the poignancy of the human story behind it cannot affect the impartial procedure of law. But the solicitor general of India has been requested by the apex court to explore whether diplomatic channels can be activated in order to ensure that the courts of another country did not disregard its orders.

 What is intriguing is that reportedly, the concern of the Supreme Court seems to be that it is a superior court and the enforceability of its orders ?should not to be left to be decided by the perception of the court of another country?. The hierarchy assumed in the comment is existent only within India. It would be absurd to extend it, even by implication, as the court in its wisdom knows. Moreover, to seek extra-legal means of compliance, to involve diplomatic channels, is to move away from the rigour of law. Even if the cultural assumptions of courts in other countries are different, as they clearly are in this case, conflicting judgments by two courts in two different countries on a family matter cannot be resolved by shifting from legal technicalities to diplomatic palaver.

 WAYS TO KEEP WHITE ELEPHANTS ALIVE

 If the left is serious about saving the PSUs, it has to comply with the prescribed corporate management practices, argues Satrujit Banerjee

 Result of inaction

 When the Congress-led coalition government arrived at the common minimum programme shortly after the 2004 general election, the most contentious and divisive issue was whether the privatization of public sector units should continue. Coalition politics forced the reform-minded prime minister to accept the diktat of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Communist Party of India of putting an end to it.

 The concept of PSUs was espoused in the first five year plan to ensure accountability. While the registrar of companies was to monitor the private sector, it was felt that units where the government, Central or state, had more than 50 per cent equity-holding should be subject to stricter vigil and must come under the purview of the comptroller and auditor general of India. To give the CAG teeth, the Central Vigilance Commission was formed. Just in case all these failed, there was of course the dreaded and ubiquitous Central Bureau of Investigation. A further check was put in place by having the CAG place an annual report on the table of the legislature. 

 The notion of government ownership of commercial establishments has undergone a radical change in the past 50 years. It is now only the left which maintain that diluting government holding will reduce accountability of PSUs. It is argued that this belief has nothing to do with the vote bank issue. Since the CPI(M)-led Left Front has had an uninterrupted stint in West Bengal, let us examine how PSUs have fared in the state on both transparency and accountability fronts.

 The CAG, in his report of 2001 (Volume 1, Civil ) states that accounts for the Sisal plantation scheme have ?not (been) prepared since inception? in 1955-56. The accounts of Oriental Gas Companies? undertakings have ?not been prepared since inception? (1960-61). The accounts of the government sales emporia in Calcutta and Howrah have ?not been prepared since inception? in (1951-52). 

 The same goes for the government silk reeling scheme (inception 1956-57), government training-cum-production centre, Mechanical Toys, Hooghly (1972-73), the government?s Central Lock Factory, Bargachia, Howrah (1972-73), the government industrial estate, Manicktola (since 1983-84), and Kanchrapara area development scheme(since 1975-76). 

 The CAG then lists 15 other companies whose accounts are not available for three years to a decade. Remember, he is not passing judgment on the financial performance of these organizations. He is stating that these units have not found it necessary to maintain and submit the most elementary of all requirements, keeping pro forma accounts for years on end. 

 The CAG?s concluding words are as harsh an indictment of the state government as can be issued by a civil servant. He rues that ??the lack of accountability arising out of the failure to prepare accounts by the departmentally-run units for years on end is a matter of serious concern, as large amounts of public funds are involved coupled with the possibility of serious financial irregularities remaining undetected for long periods. Since these are departmentally run commercial units, responsibility for failure to ensure accountability of public funds should be fixed on the Heads of Departments. The government should re-examine the justification of continued release of budgetary funds to units without finalised accounts and without assessing their financial performance...? This was written three years ago. No one has been brought to book. It is as if no one in the state government had read the CAG?s report.

 Why couldn?t the CAG take corrective action during the year? He writes, ??Audit observations noticed during audit and not settled on the spot are communicated to the heads of PSUs and concerned departments of the State Government through Inspection Reports (IR ). The heads of PSUs are required to furnish replies to the IR through respective heads of departments within a period of six weeks....IR issued upto March 2001 pertaining to 54 PSUs disclosed that 503 paragraphs relating to 281 IR remained outstanding at the end of September 2001. Of these, 95 IR containing 182 paragraphs had not been replied for more than two years...??

 In his report for the next year, ending on March 31, 2002, the CAG vents his frustration and notes curtly, ??The following persistent irregularities and system deficiencies in the financial matters of PSUs have been repeatedly pointed out during the course of their audit of their accounts, but no corrective action was taken by these PSUs so far...??

 What about the legislature ? Surely it can take the government to task as it is constitutionally empowered to oversee PSUs? working and justify their continued funding. The CAG?s annual report makes critical observations that have not been taken up for discussion by the West Bengal assembly. A quick look at the CAG reports of March 1999 and 2002 reveals that several items which were not taken up for discussion at all were submitted a decade or more earlier. 

 Another sign of impudence is listed under ?Reasons for delay in placement in Legislature?. The CAG notes, ?Not stated by Government? in most cases. In the case of Calcutta State Transport Corporation, the reasons furnished by the government for not placing the CAG?s Special Audit Report before the legislature deserves special mention. For 1998-99, the reason cited is ?Adequate printed copies not available for placement?. When the CAG received the same excuse the next year, that is 1999-2000 , he clarifies it by adding ?...as stated by government?.

 The next year has the same entry. Ultimately, repeated pleas for action on the CAG reports seem to have stirred the government of West Bengal. The CAG report for 2001-02 records, ?The Government has directed the Corporation to print required number of copies of SARs for the years 1980/81 to 1992/93 for laying the same at the time?. It thus took the state government four years to realize that if the SARs of 1980-81 to 1992-93 were to be discussed in the legislature, copies needed to be circulated among those discussing it. But is there any point in bringing up for discussion the reports two decades later? Would any suggested corrective action be meaningful?

 Clearly, if the state government wishes to latch on to the PSUs, it has to be accountable to both the CAG and the legislature. Non-compliance of every facet of ethical corporate management practices will convince people that if the government is not serious about running these units, it has no business funding them. And vote bank or not, these units must go.

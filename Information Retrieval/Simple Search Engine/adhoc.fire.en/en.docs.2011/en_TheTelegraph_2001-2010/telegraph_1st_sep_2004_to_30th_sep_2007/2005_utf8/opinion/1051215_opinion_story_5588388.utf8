 Letters to Editor

 Woman in dark

 Sir ? A woman officer of the Indian Air Force has been fired for the first time in the history of the organization. On the one hand, the air force had framed charges of financial irregularities against her and on the other, Gupta had accused three officers of the IAF of sexually harassing her. But it is interesting to note that a woman is being punished even after she has pressed charges of sexual harassment. We are more used to seeing women get a sympathetic ear every time they complain of sexual harassment. Gupta also claims to blow the whistle on corruption within the IAF, but the truth remains elusive. There is no denying that sexual exploitation continues to be a disturbing reality at workplaces, but it is not difficult for women to use the charge for their own gains. Are women having an unfair advantage over men in hoping to get away even in cases of real crime by framing charges of sexual harassment?

 Yours faithfully,

Rasmita Rath, Cuttack

 Sir ? ?Cloud remains over court martial? as well as ?Heat on Army?s Anjali?(Dec 8 and 9) should be an eye opener for all the authorities concerned. As citizens of a democratic country, we expect discipline to be enforced in the defence forces as it must be done in all branches of the government. But the facts and circumstances in every case of court martial leaves the public suspicious. How serious can be a charge of financial embezzlement of Rs 1,080 when defence forces have developed immunity to scams worth crores of rupees. The law officers probing such cases are themselves subject to judgment. It is time the government understands the importance of the citizens? right to information and lets the Central Vigilance Commission function in an environment free from interference.

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir ? Anjali Gupta?s dismissal from the IAF is shocking. While parliamentarians and legislators ? against whom charges of misappropriation of crores of public money are pending in various courts ? roam about like kings, Gupta?s dismissal for the alleged misappropriation of a paltry sum of Rs 1,080 seems to be a frame-up. This looks like another blatant proof of the discrimination prevalent in the government services of this country. Will the judiciary take note of this disparity and make the system more egalitarian as well as transparent?

 Yours faithfully,

Sushanta Narayan Biswas, Shillong

 Sir ? Anjali Gupta had filed a case of sexual harassment against her senior officers, which was proved to be baseless by the General Court Martial. Assuming that investigations were fair, it must be said that women like Gupta try to take unfair advantage of their relatively weaker position in society vis-?-vis men. There are cases where women have deliberately accused men of crimes they have not committed to settle some personal scores with them. Unfortunately, for the women of the country, these cases can only have an adverse effect on the genuine cases of exploitation against women. For, women are themselves providing reasons to suspect them.

 Yours faithfully,

Mahesh Kumar, New Delhi

 Sir ? Since the charges levelled against Anjali Gupta in the General Court Martial are not of a very grave kind, it is time for the National Commission for Women to take up her case, particularly since Gupta has brought serious charges of sexual harassment against her male colleagues.

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir ? The IAF?s dismissal of Anjali Gupta may open up a floodgate of controversies on the issue of how women are often at the receiving end of discriminatory treatment in the Indian military services. Women, being a tiny minority in the forces, often find themselves at the mercy of their male colleagues, both senior as well as of the same rank. Gupta had reportedly complained against the misbehaviour of some of her seniors. If the country?s administrative system fails to look into the matter properly, the media must take up the issue to ensure justice to Gupta.

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Packing a punch

 Sir ? The Union health minister?s attempt to alert smokers through pictorial messages deserves accolades (?A picture worth thousand warnings?, Dec 5) . But these warnings need to be backed by strict regulatory measures in order to be effective. In spite of regulatory laws, people still smoke in trains or on the platforms and that too in the presence of railway officials. The law needs to be enforced more strictly and its violation should be met with severe punishment. The health department spends crores of rupees on tobacco-related diseases. If smoking is banned, the government will be able to save a large part of this expense. 

 Yours faithfully,

Subhankar Mukherjee, Borehat

 Sir ? The ban on the depiction of smoking in films is most welcome. People get easily influenced by, and tend to imitate, the cigarette-smoking characters on screen. The ban should be applied to the small screen as well.

 Yours faithfully,

Amit V. Sengupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is good to know that cigarette packets will soon carry pictorial messages as warnings. This move should end up considerably reducing the number of smokers. People who smoke not only harm themselves but also pose a serious threat to those around them. Since a large number of Indians are still illiterate, pictorial warnings are more effective in driving important messages home. It is easy to ignore the statutory warning at the corner of a pack of cigarettes, but it will take some effort to overlook bold visuals with a message covering half the pack.

 Yours faithfully,

Sujit De, Sodepur

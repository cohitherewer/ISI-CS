 Paperback Pickings

 Imagine, guess and contrive

Mansfield (Vintage, ? 4.65) by C.K. Stead is a historical novel that spans three years in the life of the writer, Katherine Mansfield, during World War I. These years are marked by her determined struggle to write the ?new kind of fiction?, and by the ups and downs in her relationship with John Middleton Murray, whom she marries very soon afterwards. ?This is a work of fiction,? Stead writes in his acknowledgements, ?and therefore employs imagination, guesswork and contrivance. Like every historical novel, it fills as best as it can ? and sometimes also is glad to exploit ? gaps in the records...None of the characters is invented, and all major events, occasions and relationships are as near to documented ?truth? as I could make them.?

 Ten Little Indians (Vintage, ? 4.65) by Sherman Alexie collects nine emotionally resonant stories about Native Americans who find themselves at personal and cultural crossroads. In ?Do You Know Where I Am??, two college sweethearts rescue a lost cat ? a simple act that has profound moral consequences for the rest of their lives together. In ?What You Pawn I Will Redeem?, a homeless Indian man must raise $1,000 in 24 hours to buy back the fancy dance outfit stolen from his grandmother fifty years earlier.

 I want to be a teacher (Vikas, Rs 125) is subtitled ?Experiences, facts and directions for school and college goers?, and is part of the My Dream Career Series. This series seeks to help students make informed choices about careers, and some of the other volumes are about Engineering, Law, Research, Finances and Civil Services.

Gender Dimensions in Disaster Management: A Guide 

for South Asia (Zubaan, Rs 195) by Madhavi Malalgoda Ariyabandu 

and Maithree Wickrama-singhe argues that the specific vulnerabilities and 

capacities of men and women, and the gender or social dynamics of disaster situations 

are often not obviously visible, and can be exposed through detailed livelihood 

analyses. This book aims to address the dearth of information on this subject, 

with a focus on south Asia, and targets policy-makers and development practitioners 

whose contribution is vital for disaster management and sustainable development.

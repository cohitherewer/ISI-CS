 Letters to Editor

 A new ball game

 Sir ? Live coverage and the growing popularity of the game have led the International Cricket Council to periodically experiment with the rules governing one-day cricket, in a bid to increase its competitiveness. One such notable change was the introduction of neutral and third umpires. But the fresh set of rules announced by the ICC committee headed by Sunil Gavaskar, especially the provision relating to soccer-style substitution, may transform the game. 

 The 12th man will now not be restricted to fetching drinks or fielding, but will also be allowed to play. In effect, it means a captain can change the balance of his team, depending on exigencies. A spinner can be replaced with a pacer if it is found that pitch conditions were initially read wrongly; and the side batting first with seven specialist batsmen can drop a batsman and attack with five bowlers. But the question is, would this not give too clear an advantage to the captain who wins the toss and bats first? It is also not clear why the committee has not issued instructions on whether the side batting second too can substitute a bowler with a batsman to off-set any disadvantage. 

 As for the changes in field restrictions, these would increase the pressure on a captain, with the timing of the block of overs on which to have restrictions hotly debated in the commentary box. It is, thus, hardly surprising that while the earlier changes had no gestation period, the latest alterations are not final and can be rolled back.

 Yours faithfully,

Amrit Amlan Pattanaik, Cuttack

 Sir ? Call me a purist, but I believe that one doesn?t need ?gimmicks? to keep alive the gentleman?s game. The five day version of the game may be boring to some, but that?s real cricket. Kerry Packer and Co. introduced one-day cricket, full of explosive thrills, which has become acceptable today as it provides some decent encounters over 50 overs. The format, as it is today, is balanced, giving equal opportunity to bat and ball, with the field restrictions in the first 15 overs adding to the drama. Allowing substitution in a cricket match is like going on a date with more than one person ? unromantic and not done. Please don?t mess around with the game 

 Yours faithfully,

Altaf H. Ladiwala, Mumbai

 Sir ? The ICC?s new rules allowing player substitution will give a major boost to specialists. However, the best part of the new rules is that on-field umpires can consult third umpires at any stage of the game. This means that now there will be less controversies over critical decisions which quite often change the course of a game. Thus, it is hoped that Sachin Tendulkar will bat for longer even when Steve Bucknor is umpire. The ICC may consider another change ? reducing the number of overs since, in most cases, the middle of an innings gets boring. Reducing the overs will not only intensify the excitement, but it will also save a lot of time of the viewers.

 Yours faithfully,

Anurag Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? Changes are always welcome. But old is always gold, and the ICC?s new cricketing rules ? made with an eye to commercializing the sport further ? will do more harm than good to a sport which drives millions across the world crazy. 

 The introduction of a specialist will not only invite confusion but also make the game one-sided as the team batting second can easily assess the situation and capitalize on it. On the positive side, this could be an opportunity for many youngsters and specialists who no longer have to be on the team as extras. 

 Yours faithfully,

Pooja Sharma, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? Since cricket has long lost its imperial glamour and status as a gentleman?s game, there is no harm in improvizing the rules of the one-day version to make it more challenging and interesting for the players and spectators. With the interest shown by China and some other nations in cricket, more and more competition is expected in the future. The new rules will result in the emphasis being as much on planning as on performance. 

 Yours faithfully,

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? At least one aspect of the ICC?s new rules for one-dayers is confusing. Why has it been left to the fielding captain to choose when the second and third blocks of fielding restrictions are to come on? When batsmen tend to dominate most one-dayers, the fielding captain cannot really use this measure as a weapon. In the middle and late overs, his main aim is to stem the opposition?s flow of runs. And if he really wants to do that by picking up wickets, he can bring fielders into the thirty-yards circle under existing conditions without formally resorting to fielding restrictions. This part of the experimental law will only increase the complications of the game.

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir ? June 27, 2005 was the 125th birth anniversary of Helen Keller. But I was surprised and saddened to find that The Telegraph had not a word on this great 20th century personality. While it gave a lot of coverage to bandhs and so on, surely a report on Helen Keller would have created awareness of society?s responsibility towards the visually handicapped?

 Yours faithfully,

Paresh Rajda, Calcutta

 COACH DRIVER

 Cricket is the only sport in which a fuss is made over captaincy. So much importance is ascribed to a captain in cricket that sometimes a player is selected only on the basis of his so-called leadership qualities. The case of Mike Brearley, captain of England in the early Eighties, comes readily to mind. In all other sports, captains are no longer the master of the ship. The task of leading is left to the coach/manager. This is a specific fallout of the growth of professionalization in the world of sport. There are games, of course, in which no captain is required since individuals play individuals. Golf and tennis are obvious examples but here too the coach is central to the performance of a player. This diminution in the role of the captain can be explained by the fact that in games like football, hockey and rugby competition has become fierce. As a result, major strategic and tactical decisions can no longer be left to one man who is on the field, playing and in the thick of things. In football, to take an illustration, all major decisions ? the final eleven, substitutions, the overall strategy and so on ? are taken by the coach-cum-manager. This has reduced the position of the captain to nothing more than a figurehead.

 In cricket, it is increasingly observed that many of the major decisions are actually taken by a collective which sometimes means the whole team or consists of the senior members of the side. The coach is always a member of this collective. It is also clear that behind every successful team there is always a coach ? John Buchanan, Duncan Fletcher, Dave Whatmore, Bob Woolmer. What is significant is that these coaches were none of them really top class players. But after retirement they have made a science out of the art of coaching. Armed with a laptop and video footage, the coach works behind the scenes, working out the strengths and weaknesses of his own players and those of the opposing side. On the basis of this, he devises the team strategy. The captain merely implements it on the field. The presence of the coach in the state of play is manifest these days in the number of times the twelfth man goes out to the field on some pretext or the other. Instructions are also sent out through the man fielding at the ropes. These are new features of cricket which are suggestive of changes taking place off the field.

 The storm in a teacup over Greg Chappell?s comments on Sourav Ganguly glosses over these changes. Chappell as the coach should be allowed to function as a sort of chief executive officer with control over the side including team selection. The question is whether Ganguly (or any other player) has a place in the side and in Chappell?s scheme of things. The captaincy issue is a minor one. In the memorable words of Alice in Wonderland, it is a question of who is the master.

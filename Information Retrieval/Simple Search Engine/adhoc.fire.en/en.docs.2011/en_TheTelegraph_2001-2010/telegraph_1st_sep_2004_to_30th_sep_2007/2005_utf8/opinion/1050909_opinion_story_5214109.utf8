 BRUTAL FIGURES

 It will take India another hundred years to become part of the developed world. When the United Nations? Human Development Report 2005 puts it this way, the matter is far more appalling than simply a question of global prestige. To be ranked 127th (out of 177 countries), below Sri Lanka and Namibia, but above Pakistan and Bangladesh, is less of a shame than some of the other trends pointed out by the report. The incidence of poverty has fallen in India, placing it on track to attain the Millennium Development Goal on extreme poverty. Yet, in actual terms, this ?improvement? has failed to make any difference to some of its most important and most vulnerable citizens. The worst victims of poverty in India are still its children, especially the girls. They continue to fall by the wayside of ?development? and economic ?growth?, raising fundamental questions about how these notions are understood, implemented and measured in India. When it comes to the physical well-being of children ? child and maternal mortality, primary education and gender equality ? the development goals seem to be receding alarmingly.

 The figures are brutal. More than 25 lakh children die in India every year, making up a fifth of the world?s child deaths. And within this, the under-five mortality rate is 50 per cent higher for girls than for boys. The Millennium Development Goal was to do away with gender inequity in primary school enrolment by 2005. But this still seems a far cry for India. The regional disparities ? say, between Uttar Pradesh and Kerala ? also remain wide. Where India is going wrong is not only in being unable to reach basic nutrition, healthcare and education to its poorest, especially in the rural sector. But there is also widespread, and often deliberate, statistical misrepresentation. Wrong figures ? regarding child mortality, for instance ? are collected by the local administration in the rural areas in order to show that the government?s schemes are working, when the actual situation remains far from improved.

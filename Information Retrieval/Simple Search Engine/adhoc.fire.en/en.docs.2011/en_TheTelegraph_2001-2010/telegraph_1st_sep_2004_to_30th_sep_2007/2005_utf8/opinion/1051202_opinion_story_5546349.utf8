 VISIBLE THREAT

 It may be hasty to see Bangladesh as another Afghanistan in the making. The geopolitical context that gave birth to the taliban regime in Kabul does not prevail in Dhaka. The two countries also have very different racial and cultural contexts. Yet, Tuesday?s suicide bombings in Bangladesh should leave no one in doubt about the enormity of the danger that the country faces from Islamist militants. This was the first time that suicide bombers struck in the country. But there has been enough violence by religious extremists over the past few years to show how dangerously close Bangladesh is to the brink. Even the links that the Bangladeshi terrorists have had with al Qaida and such other groups were not unknown. Scores of them had their arms training and indoctrination in taliban camps in Afghanistan. Tuesday?s violence is significant in that it shows once more what these militants want to destroy before they can establish a ?talibanized? rule in Dhaka. The attacks outside the courts carry a message. A few weeks ago, two judges were killed by the Islamists. Attacks on the press, civil society and women?s groups and non-government organizations have become common occurrences. All this shows the militants? design to strike at all kinds of freedom and liberal values. 

 What is perhaps even more worrying is the government?s responses to the jihadi threat. That it seems powerless to fight the terrorists is the lesser problem. What is worse is the mounting suspicion that some sections within the ruling coalition of Begum Khaleda Zia are conniving with the killers, if not actually aiding them. There was always a danger that two partners of the coalition ? the Jamat-e-Islami and Islamic Oikya Jote ? would use their participation in the government to further their sectarian religious and social agenda. Now, the needle of suspicion is increasingly pointed to sections within Ms Khaleda Zia?s Bangladesh Nationalist Party. It cannot be a coincidence that most of the militants? targets have been opposition political parties, particularly the Awami League, and their workers and sympathizers. Even international aid agencies and human rights groups are sceptical of the government?s ability and will to take on the terrorists. So low is the government?s credibility that its attempts to blame India for all its problems have become a matter of ridicule at home and abroad. 

 India, though, has enough reasons to be alarmed at the situation in Bangladesh. The long and porous border between the two countries makes it ideal territory for terrorist operations. New Delhi needs to strengthen the defence mechanisms against possible threats emanating from Bangladesh. It must also work alongside other nations to help the defenders of democracy and freedom within the Bangladeshi society.

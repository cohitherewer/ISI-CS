 Out and About

 Heavyweight Upamanyu Chatterjee is all set to offer a new-year Weight Loss programme! So, pull up your socks and get ready for a tough sprint thats going to teach your jiggling tyres a lesson. If youre already panting, and cursing yourself for falling for it, take it easy. The joke is over. Published by Penguin Books India, Upamanyu Chatterjees fourth novel, Weight Loss is all set to be released this month. Author of the acclaimed English, August, Chatterjees last novel, The Mammaries of a Welfare State, won him the Sahitya Akademi Award . His latest novel, Weight Loss, is Bholas story ? the innocent guy who is obsessed with sex and running. Bhola has this immense ability to fall in love with all the wrong people. A right blend of black humour and punctuated silences makes the novel a compelling one. Priced at Rs 495, the 424 page-tome is a hardback edition. Sounds weighty enough.

 Katie Holmes isnt marrying Tom Cruise! Thats final? Now dont gasp without listening to the entire story. Its only for the time being and, theres reason enough. The actress ? better known for her much-hyped role in Batman Begins ? has no plans of playing the runaway-bride. She has simply refused to waddle down the aisle in her wedding gown, with a wiggling tummy. Yes, as you must be aware, Holmes is pregnant and no designer would disagree that covering a swelling tummy requires much more than sheer skill and talent. Now, whoever is spreading the rumour that Holmes is ready to marry while shes tummy ? oops! ? Mummy, has got it all wrong. If only one knew what women want!

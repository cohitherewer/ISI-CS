 IN RIGHT MEASURE

 There are some changes that take place almost invisibly. The demands for justice for the unspeakable horrors that took place in Gujarat in early 2002 have been gathering direction, as is demonstrated by the number of cases now in the courts. Most recently, the representatives of those killed in the Gulbarg Society massacre have filed a civil suit, demanding compensation from the local leaders of the Bajrang Dal and the leader of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Mr Praveen Togadia. The compensation suit makes particular political organizations liable, instead of claiming damages from the state for having failed to protect the life and liberty of its citizens. Petitions of the second kind are more common, and in a favourable judgment, the state, or the public, compensates the victims of violence. But the Gulbarg Society suit is the second of its kind. In the first, relatives of two non-resident Indians, who had been killed during the communal violence in Gujarat, filed a compensation suit making Mr Narendra Modi liable.

 The shift in emphasis is worth noting. The rights to life and liberty, to free movement and the right not to be discriminated against are no longer being held to be the sole responsibility of the state. Preserving constitutional rights is as much a responsibility of citizens towards one another as much as it is that of the state towards its citizens. The way to this change was inaugurated by the judgment of the Kerala high court against bandhs, by which the liability of the damage to life, property and mobility consequent upon a bandh could be fixed on political parties calling that bandh. At the broadest theoretical level, the expansion of the notion of accountability is the best route to a fuller understanding of the relationship between rights and responsibility, and of the application of the idea of rights. On a more practical level, it is an effective weapon against the overriding arrogance of dominant political parties. It is true that court cases take time. The message may take a while to sink in. Yet compensation to the tune of crores or lakhs or even thousands will begin to pinch, and the strength of numbers will no longer provide immunity from legal action. It is far more difficult to fix liability for murder during violent conflicts. The shift of emphasis will ultimately compel political organizations and every other institution and individual to think twice before attempting to breach the rights of citizens.

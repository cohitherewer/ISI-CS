 PANIC ATTACK

 Terror comes in many guises in Iraq. It erupted in a horrific form among the hundreds of thousands of Shia pilgrims heading towards the Khadimiya mosque in northern Baghdad on August 30. As the crowd was crossing a bridge across the Tigris to reach the mosque, somebody seemed to have shouted out a warning against the presence of suicide bombers in the crowd. And that was enough to unleash a terrible panic among the thousands on the narrow bridge, which led to the stampede that may have killed nearly a thousand and injured many hundreds. As always in these situations, those who were crushed to death or thrown into the river to drown were mostly women, children, the elderly and the infirm. What sparked off this panic is still not clear, circulating as vague rumours in an atmosphere already saturated with conflict and fear. It has also been suggested by some survivors that sheer mismanagement may have started the panic on the bridge. But a few hours before the tragedy, a couple of mortars had been thrown at the crowd, killing seven ? an act for which a Sunni insurgent group has claimed responsibility. Hence, the leader of one of the ruling Shia parties has publicly inferred that ?the terrorists, Saddamists and radical extremists? were responsible for spreading the rumour about the suicide-bombers. 

 A ?reconstituted? Iraq is now poised on the brink of civil war. At the heart of this conflict is the new draft constitution, described by Washington as a ?beacon of freedom and democracy?, endorsed by the ruling Shia and Kurd coalition, and rejected by the Sunnis who feel dangerously sidelined after the fall of Saddam Hussein?s Baathist regime. To work out a consensus with the Sunnis over this before the referendum in October is crucial for controlling the Sunni-driven insurgency in Iraq. And this is why the ruling coalition must desist from forcing the draft through parliament in spite of having the numbers to do so. The Sunnis object to its federalism, which they fear would cut them off from Iraq?s oil wealth, leaving them powerless. It is, therefore, easy for the Khadimiya tragedy to be taken up into this complicated and violent situation, even though residents from the neighbouring Sunni Arab district rushed to the accident site, rescuing people out of the river and even donating blood.

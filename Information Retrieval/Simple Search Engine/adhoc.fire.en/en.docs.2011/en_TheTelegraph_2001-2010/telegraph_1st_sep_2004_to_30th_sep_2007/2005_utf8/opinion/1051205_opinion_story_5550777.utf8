 Letters to Editor

 Blind following

 Sir ? Rahul Dravid?s comments on the behaviour of the crowd at Eden Gardens during the fourth one day international between India and South Africa does not show Calcutta?s cricket fans in good light (?Dravid takes a dig at crowd behaviour?, Nov 28). The Indian captain referred to incidents of crowd trouble in Calcutta in the past and added that the spectators had abused Indian fielders during the game. But one wonders whether Dravid is raising the issue just to divert the attention from India?s poor performance. The Indian team surrendered tamely to the Proteas and Dravid himself was guilty of leading his side poorly. It was the South African skipper, Graeme Smith, who played a great knock to give the cricket lovers of Calcutta some reason to cheer. Some people have objected to the Eden crowd giving a standing ovation to Smith after he completed his century. But didn?t the same lot praise the Chennai crowd for their sporting behaviour after Pakistan won a test match in Chepauk in 1999? 

 Yours faithfully,

Khalid Pervez, Calcutta

 Sir ? The Calcutta crowd behaved badly with the Indian players, but not because a certain cricketer from Bengal was not selected in the team. On the contrary, the crowd reaction had a lot to do with the manner of Sourav Ganguly?s dropping. Eden Gardens is famous for disputing unfair decisions. When Kapil Dev was dropped in a similar manner for a test match, Calcuttans had risen in protest against the unjust decision. Moreover, during the game against South Africa, the crowd had not resorted to throwing missiles to vent their anger. There were just a few jeers from sarcastic fans. So what?s the noise all about? 

 Yours faithfully,

Shilpa Chakrabortty, Calcutta

 Sir ?Too much is being made of the crowd behaviour at the Eden Gardens. The spectators had been disappointed because the South Africans had outplayed the Indians in every department of the game. There is nothing wrong in cheering a good performance. In fact, the Eden crowd had shown real sporting spirit by rooting for the South African side which had clearly been the better team on that day. Rahul Dravid?s comments about the partisan attitude of Calcuttas fans were unfortunate. The Indian captain must have forgotten how play had been stopped by angry spectators at the same venue when Sachin Tendulkar was ruled run out after Shoaib Akhtar obstructed his path in a test match against Pakistan.

 Yours faithfully,

Pabitra De Sarker, Calcutta

 Sir ? There seems to be no end to the great Indian cricket circus, both on and off the field. After leaked emails, high-profile personality clashes and unceremonious ousters, comes Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s decision not to show up during the game in Calcutta, presumably because the local boy failed to find a place in the side. Buddhadebbabu is an ardent cricket lover and recently donated a plot for the setting up of a cricket academy. These incidents seem to confirm Churchill?s views on cricket ? ?a game of fools where one fool throws the ball, another fool stops it, and thousands of fools cheer or jeer them?.

 Yours faithfully

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Cricket lovers in Calcutta do not need Sharad Pawar?s certificate to prove their patriotic credentials (?Pawar plays down Chappell gesture?, Nov 30). Pawar, whose links with the game can be described as tenuous at best, must have known that the protests at Eden were not directed at the Indian team but against a group of Ganguly-baiters which includes the current coach, Greg Chappell. Pawar also had a word of praise for Sourav Ganguly, and said that he was one of the best all rounders that India has ever produced. By calling a specialist batsman an allrounder, the BCCI chief has proved that he is siding with Ganguly?s detractors.

 Yours faithfully,

Jayanta Das Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? The disgusting show of ?support? for Sourav Ganguly during the match in Calcutta has discredited the man who had done away with parochialism in the larger interest of the team. Ganguly was one of the few Indian captains to have stood up against regional interests, but the boorish behaviour of a section of Calcuttans has tarnished his image. The crowd?s behaviour was an insult to a player of his class and stature. This would only make things that much more difficult for the former captain even as he works his way back to the team. 

 Yours faithfully,

Tilak Ghoshal, Calcutta

 Sir ? The hue and cry raised by cricket lovers in Calcutta about the exclusion of Sourav Ganguly comes as a surprise. It is common knowledge that Ganguly was axed due to his poor form, so why did the spectators at Eden Gardens decide to support the South Africans during the match played in Calcutta? Doesn?t the country come before a state or a region? 

 Yours faithfully,

Shankaran S., Calcutta

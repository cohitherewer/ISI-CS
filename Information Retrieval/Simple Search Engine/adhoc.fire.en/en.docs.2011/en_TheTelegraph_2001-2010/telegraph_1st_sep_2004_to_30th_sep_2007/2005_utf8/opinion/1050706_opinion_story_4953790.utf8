 Extracts from the WHO?s revised international health regulations, adopted at the World Health Assembly, May 16, 2005

 A Maritime Declaration of Health shall conform to the model provided in Annex 8. 

 4. A State Party may decide: (a) to dispense with the submission of the MDH by all arriving ships; or (b) to require the submission of the MDH under a recommendation concerning ships arriving from affected areas or to require it from ships which might otherwise carry infection or contamination. The State Party shall inform shipping operators or their agents of these requirements. 

 Article 38: Health Part of the Aircraft General Declaration: 

 1. The pilot or the pilot?s agent, in flight or upon landing at the first airport in the territory of a State Party, shall, to the best of his or her ability, except when that State Party does not require it, complete and deliver to the competent authority for that airport the HPAGD... 

 2. The pilot or the pilot?s agent shall supply any information required by the State Party as to health conditions on board during an international voyage and any health measure applied to the aircraft. 

 3. A State Party may decide: 

 (a) to dispense with the submission of the HPAGD by all arriving aircraft; or (b) to require the submission of the HPAGD under a recommendation concerning aircraft arriving from affected areas or to require it from aircraft which might otherwise carry infection or contamination. The State Party shall inform aircraft operators or their agents of these requirements. 

 Article 39: Ship sanitation certificates: 

 1. Ship Sanitation Control Exemption Certificates and Ship Sanitation Control Certificates shall be valid for a maximum period of six months. This period may be extended by one month if the inspection or control measures required cannot be accomplished at the port. 

 2. If a valid SSCE certificate or SSC certificate is not produced or evidence of a public health risk is found on board a ship, the State Party may proceed as provided in paragraph 1 of Article 27. 

 3. The certificates referred to in this Article shall conform to the model in Annex 3. 

 4. Whenever possible, control measures shall be carried out when the ship and holds are empty. In the case of a ship in ballast, they shall be carried out before loading. 

 5. When control measures are required and have been satisfactorily completed, the competent authority shall issue a SSC certificate, noting the evidence found and the control measures taken. 

 6. The competent authority may issue a SSCE certificate at any port specified under Article 20 if it is satisfied that the ship is free of infection and contamination, including vectors and reservoirs. Such a certificate shall normally be issued only if the inspection of the ship has been carried out when the ship and holds are empty or when they contain only ballast or other material, of such a nature or so disposed as to make a thorough inspection of the holds possible. 

 7. If the conditions under which control measures are carried out are such that, in the opinion of the competent authority for the port where the operation was performed, a satisfactory result cannot be obtained, the competent authority shall make a note to that effect on the SSC certificate.

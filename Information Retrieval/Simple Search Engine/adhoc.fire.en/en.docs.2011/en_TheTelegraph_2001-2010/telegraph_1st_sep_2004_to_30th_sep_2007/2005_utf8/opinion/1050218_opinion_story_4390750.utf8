 A MORE PUBLIC ROLE

 Suryakant Waghmore

 The current debate over reservations in the private sector unravels the claims of competing nationalities. Especially now that the policy threatens, once again, the traditionally privileged castes for whom caste-based identity has become a bane. For them, merit is more important to the nation than petty caste-based articulations. 

 On the other hand, there is the nation constructed on the basis of caste identity to which the traditionally marginalized communities aspire. Not only are their aspirations different from the privileged castes, the mode of articulation is also different. Participation, or as they call it ?diversity?, in all the sectors from which they have been traditionally excluded, is top priority. The goal for one is competition, for the other social justice.

 Anti-reservationists think globalization and reservation cannot go hand in hand since the first connotes competition and rationalization, while the other, discrimination and ?casteization?. They see the demand for further reservations by Dalits as a ?rent-seeking tendency? in non-state capital without any attempt to cultivate social or economic capital among Dalits. The arguments of the pro-reservationists ? for example that the private sector in India itself being incompetent, the question of Dalit competence does not arise ? are not robust either . 

 Right spirit

 Are Dalits averse to competition and globalization? Globalization in its earliest days came to the subcontinent in the form of colonialism. Dalits gained from it as it also signalled the advent of modernity. Mahatma Phule and Babasaheb Ambedkar were all colonial legacies. The Dalit middle class owes a lot to the English Utilitarians. 

 Yet in contradiction to the spirit of modernization, anti-reservationists often target the Dalit creamy layer for reaping ?undeserved? benefits. This anti-diversity school forgets that reservation or affirmative action in the case of Dalits is their fundamental right as India?s local culture is against Dalit participation in civil and political interactions. 

 Moreover, despite its interface with modernity, this exploitative culture has not changed much. One may take the case of women?s exploitation in upper-caste families. Investment in the education of sons and saving for the endogamous marriage of daughters are signs of culture. Thus a highly educated Brahmin may continue to be a patriarch or casteist. 

 Political competition

 Reservation for Dalits is more about their right to participate in this exclusionist society. If the creamy layer is to be touched, then let the rich in all the castes be targeted. Unfortunately, the Dalit creamy layer is in a miserable minority. While one may agree with the thought that quality education for poor backward-class children should be guaranteed and not reservation in perpetuity, how does one ensure that, given our culture, all merit- orious Dalits are absorbed in the job market?

 How do we arrive at an aggregate of all the nationalities? Through competitive politics under parliamentary democracy. Competition in politics is already severe, and one has to acknowledge the presence of the likes of Laloo Prasad Yadav and Mayavati. Also, in the resulting aggregation, it is not only Dalits who are voicing their right to participate in the market economy, there is also a sizeable number of non- Brahminic upper castes. Again, in this competition, the evaluating and grading authority is not restricted to elite castes and their understanding of merit. 

 However, if we fail to appreciate political competition and its aggregating mechanism, we will have to follow the rules set by the anti-reservationists. Reservations then will have to be done away with, both in the public and the private sector.

 RISING SUN, SETTING EMPIRE

 Stopover in Burma, 1943

Forgotten Armies: The Fall of British Asia, 1941-45

By Christopher Bayly and Tim Harper, 

Allen Lane, pound; 18

With the onset of the Japanese Blitzkrieg in December 

1941, the British Empire came tumbling down in southeast Asia. After three years 

of gruelling combat, the British were able to gain a part of their erstwhile empire. 

But by mid-1945, the British Empire was again waning in Asia. Christopher Bayly 

and Tim Harper portrays the turbulent Forties. Their approach meshes politics, 

diplomacy and social history with military narrative.

 They accept the dominant view in military historiography that the British imperial forces (which included the Indians too) fought badly against the numerically inferior Japanese forces which rapidly advanced across Malaysia and Burma ? the Tommies had no desire to sacrifice their lives for the remote outposts of the British Empire. Bayly and Harper argue that for the Indian soldiers, neither patriotism nor loyalty to the King Emperor mattered much. What mattered was regimental loyalty for their saathis. And during the Imphal-Kohima campaign, the brutality of the Japanese generated hatred among the sepoys who then fought to take revenge.

 The two writers point out that British rule did not generate any intrinsic loyalty in the colonized. The British officials were racist. They lived in their own world with its alcohol, billiards and khansamas. The indigenous collaborators of the British regime were the moneylenders and local strongmen. So, when the British Imperial Army dissolved in chaos in 1942, the locals welcomed the Japanese.

 The British defeat had destroyed the white men?s prestige. And the Japanese declaration of Asia for the Asians gave a psychological boost to the Asian nationalists. After the British reoccupation of southeast Asia, the Japanese armed nationalists in Burma and Thailand became the forces to reckon with.

 Bayly and Harper?s argument that World War II played a crucial role in accelerating decolonization is well taken. In their paradigm, the Japanese invasion and their subsequent administration were the key factors behind social transformation in southeast Asia. And this transformation made re-imposition of the British raj impossible. In the backdrop of this analysis looms American hostility to the British desire for re-establishing their old Asian empire.

 Bayly and Harper rightly emphasize the role of the Japanese in reshaping southeast Asia. But a little more attention should have been given to the changing international balance of power. Modern works, by G.C. Peden and others, have pointed to the British treasury?s prediction in 1939 that if Britain wages another global war, then London would go bankrupt. And this was exactly what happened in 1945. Further, the ensuing East-West split forced London and Washington to concentrate all available financial and military resources in front of the iron curtain in central Europe. For the Anglo-American policy-makers, in late 1945, southern Asia again became a strategic backwater.

 However, one must admit that Bayly and Harper cover a wide canvas. Their style is lively, even when they talk of the anguish of the strategists in London and Delhi while they struggled with the prisoners of war and the ?comfort women? in southeast Asia. Forgotten Armies is interesting and insightful. For the uninitiated venturing into the area, this book is an essential primer.

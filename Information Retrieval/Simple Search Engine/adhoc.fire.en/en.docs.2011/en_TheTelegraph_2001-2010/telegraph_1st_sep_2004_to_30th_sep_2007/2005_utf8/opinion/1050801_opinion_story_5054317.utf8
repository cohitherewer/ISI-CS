 GENTLE TOUCH

 The impending visit of the external affairs minister, Mr K. Natwar Singh, to Bangladesh will give an opportunity to both the countries to review their ties. It is no secret that relations between the two countries have been far from smooth in the last couple of years. The foreign minister?s visit may, therefore, contribute to a lessening of tension and could even lead to greater understanding between the two countries. The agenda for Mr Singh?s Dhaka trip is clear, if daunting. Most important, especially in the larger south Asian context, is the need for the foreign minister to reiterate India?s commitment to the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation process and to the organization?s forthcoming summit in Dhaka in November. The summit has been postponed twice before and, at least once, New Delhi had signalled that it was because of security concerns in Dhaka. Given that the Manmohan Singh government is seeking to build a stronger relationship with India?s neighbours, it is essential that India?s seriousness and commitment to the multilateral institution is communicated to the host country. If Mr Natwar Singh has to mend relations with Bangladesh, he must also convince Begum Khaleda Zia, the prime minister of Bangladesh, that India is not partial to the Awami League leader, Sheikh Hasina. This will, of course, require great diplomatic skill on the part of Mr Singh, given that traditionally the Awami League is seen as a pro-Indian party. However, it is on substantial bilateral issues that Mr Singh must really focus. 

 Clearly, three issues are of paramount importance. The first is the issue of Bangladesh providing sanctuary to militants from the North-east and the growth of religious extremism in the country. The Khaleda Zia government is seen as being soft on extremism, and clearly the government needs to do much more to change this perception. Concern about Bangladeshis is no longer restricted to India. Internationally, there are increased reports of the presence of terrorist groups with international links, including al Qaida. The issue of illegal Bangladeshi migrants, given the recent Supreme Court ruling, will certainly be a major issue for discussion. It is important that Mr Singh gets some assurance from Dhaka on this count. Finally, Mr Singh must seek to persuade Bangladesh that improving cooperation with India in trade and energy will serve its interests as well. On all these issues Bangladesh has either its own concerns or an alternative point of view. In essence, The challenge for Mr Singh is to reconcile Bangladesh?s concerns with India?s interests.

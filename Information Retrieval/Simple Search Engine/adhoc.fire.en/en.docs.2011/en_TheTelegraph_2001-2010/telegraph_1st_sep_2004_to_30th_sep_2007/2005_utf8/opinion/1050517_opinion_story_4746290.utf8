 DRAWING ON CULTURE

 MALVIKA SINGH

 It came as a pleasant shock to find both Montek Singh and Vikram Mehta of Shell, amongst others, hailing the importance of ?culture?, its sponsorhip and corporatization. For years, when many hammered away at these kinds of people ? who had the wherewithal to indulge in serious cultural philanthropy? to infuse it with resources and energize the sector, they were seen as romantic culture vultures who had no understanding of any ?real? issues ? ?economic? issues, that is. It was then an impossible task to raise small amounts of money for ?culture?. There was always a feeble excuse. None of these gentlemen with enormous personal and company wealth would be willing to look at philanthropy outside of religious, educational and medical donations to which their forefathers had committed and which they followed out of fear that a discontinuation may be ?unlucky?. 

 As our museums and archives, our material environment and skills began to deteriorate, the private sector, by and large, looked the other way. The government had set up many institutions to protect and conserve this wealth and propagate latent strengths, but they failed. Sadly, culture became a state subject. The institutions were run by government servants, babus, who had no real understanding of their mandate. The devastation of much that we inherited, the legacy we were to hold in trust for following generations, is near complete. In the process, our pride in India?s diverse, multilayered past, our present and our future has been diluted.

 Tax-free generosity

 Pupul Jayakar was pooh- poohed for showcasing India abroad with the festivals of India. When Rajiv Gandhi initiated Apna Utsavs, corporate honchos saw the exercise as low market extravaganzas for ?them?, not for ?us?. They could not comprehend the cultural and social integration that such endeavours herald. Decades later, for these same people, culture has become the new catch-phrase, the symbol of identity, the wealth that needs to be protected. It has finally become politically correct to support ?culture?. 

 But if these heavies from the corporate world truly want to put out their money, they will first have to lobby with the government and the ministry of finance to review archaic and redundant rules governing donations and endowments. They have to look at giving 100 per cent tax cuts for endowments to museums, archives and other such institutions. 

 Let us take the National Museum as an example. The babu will have to exit and the private expert will have to enter. With that, expert emoluments will have to be structured to make it worthwhile for a professional to take on this challenging task. Petty clerks will have to be hired and fired. New financial norms will have to be put in place. Fossilization will have to be replaced by energy. Daily events will have to be dreamt up and managed expertly to compete with the many other activities that have overwhelmed the public space. 

 Is there political will and passion to do this as a start? Will the babu step back and, hopefully, out? Or, will his community close ranks and sabotage the overhaul? Do we have a cabinet that believes in letting go? I cannot see any of this happening in my lifetime! 

 I recall having suggested to Manmohan Singh as finance minister and Montek Singh as finance secretary, that they should consider allowing a 100 per cent tax exemption for anyone who wants to endow the National Museum and the National Archive, as a start, to upgrade the redundant, decayed facilities and archaic infrastructure. They smiled and the idea was dismissed. A decade later, they are on hobby horse culture. And, the corporate organizations will soon realize that celebrity sponsorship is frivolous, easy, when compared to the serious business of the endowment of culture.

 HOW TO GET BACK THE MISSING TEETH

 Only by joining or allying with the Congress can Mamata Banerjee save herself from political irrelevance, argues Ashis Chakrabarti

 Lose some, gain some

 With the elections to the Calcutta municipal corporation and many civic bodies in the districts scheduled between April and June, it is safe to predict that Bengal?s political temperature will rise this year. How the opposition parties ? especially the Congress and the Trinamool Congress ? go about these polls may indicate what they could do in next year?s assembly elections.

 And, what the opposition parties do next year would depend largely on what Mamata Banerjee does in this year?s elections. For all the losses that her party suffered in the Lok Sabha elections last year, she remains pretty much the centre around which opposition politics in Bengal revolves. 

 That is why Congress leaders like Pranab Mukherjee and Priya Ranjan Das Munshi make periodic offers to her to return to the Congress. Although Sonia Gandhi has not spoken publicly on this, it is common sense that such overtures would have her approval. She who would be happy to see Banerjee break away from her alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party. 

 I have no manner of doubt that Banerjee herself would have been happy to return to the Congress. In fact, she might just be waiting for the right time to do that because the longer she stays on in the BJP?s company, the more vulnerable she makes herself. 

 In private conversations, most of her party colleagues admit that they have little to gain and everything to lose by continuing with the alliance with the BJP. Left to themselves, they would like to part company with the National Democratic Alliance immediately and join or ally with the Congress. But they want their leader to take the whole party in that direction. Besides, they know that they cannot hope to win elections on their own. They need their leader, but they also want her to see the writing on the wall. 

 The Lok Sabha elections last year showed that the party had been dumped by the majority of Muslim voters because of its alliance with the saffronites. In Andhra Pradesh, too, where Muslims form a substantial part of the population, N. Chandrababu Naidu was quick to dissociate his party from the BJP after the elections. Many of Banerjee?s colleagues fear that they may have to suffer again for their party?s continued alliance with a communal party. 

 It would be silly to think that Banerjee does not know about the risks of staying on with the BJP. Despite being part of the NDA, her party usually keeps clear of the BJP in Bengal in order to protect its secular image. 

 The Muslim factor apart, the resurgence of the Congress should have made her return to the party the most logical thing to happen. It is more or less certain that many of the old social constituents of the Congress that moved away from it in its days of decline would now start returning to it. 

 Yet, Banerjee frets at the suggestion that she should snap ties with the BJP and return to her parent party. She complains that such suggestions are actually a Congress plot to break her party. The Congress leaders who publicly invite her to return to the party, she suspects, are actually bent on finishing her off politically. 

 No doubt there are some Congress leaders in Bengal who have little love lost for her. There is nothing but mutual distrust and suspicion between them and Banerjee. Some of these Congress leaders may well be happy to keep her out of the party, no matter what they say in public. They may be happier still to see her gradually go down with the BJP. There is no doubt, however, that the overwhelming majority of the anti-left masses would welcome her in the strongest opposition formation in the state. So, the machinations of some Congress leaders are a relatively small problem. 

 A more genuine problem is the left?s support to the United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre. How can she join a Congress whose government survives at the mercy of the left? 

 It is a valid argument ? but only upto a point. Despite the entente at the Centre, the Congress and the left will continue to be adversaries in Bengal, Kerala and Tripura. It needs no great political wisdom to predict that the Congress will try to expand its areas of influence and reduce its dependence on the left and other allies. Back in the party, Banerjee would have greatly improved the Congress?s chance of a real fight with the left in Bengal. On the contrary, the alliance with a BJP that has little influence in the state, may see her own party further reduced. 

 And, if her influence is further reduced, she will not have the kind of bargaining power with the Congress that she may have now. By keeping away from the Congress, she will only isolate herself more. 

 It is true that her earlier break with the BJP and alliance with the Congress ? during the assembly elections in 2001 ? did not succeed in ousting the Left Front from power in Bengal. But the Congress was not then the win- ning party that it is now. Some might argue that Banerjee?s return to the Congress- fold once again would des- troy whatever little political credibility she is left with. The crucial question, however, is whether she can remain politically relevant by staying on with the BJP. 

 If her party wins the Calcutta corporation election, she may earn a reprieve. And it can hope to retain the corporation only with the help of the Congress. But think of the consequences for her if the Trinamool Congress loses it. The loss of the corporation will almost certainly be the last straw for her. If that happens, she might find it nearly impossible to stop defections from her party to the Congress. The defections may begin long before next year?s assembly polls. 

 Ironically, the ruling Marxists, her b?te noire, will be the happiest to see her stay away from the Congress. A reunited Congress can really throw up a challenge that the left has not faced in a decade. It could be a different scenario from the one that existed in Bengal before Banerjee broke away from the Congress and floated her party in 1997. The decline of the Congress in national politics made things difficult for the party in Bengal. A resurgent Congress, that is in power at the Centre, could be a different matter. The results of the last Lok Sabha elections show that the Congress is on the road to a revival in parts of the state. The party will try and do everything to consolidate the gains. That will obviously involve poaching on the Trinamool?s territory. 

 Banerjee is still the most popular opposition leader in Bengal. But her party is no longer a credible alternative to the left ? with or without the BJP. And, despite the current scenario in Delhi, the Congress is on its way to becoming the real challenger of the left in Bengal. There is every reason to presume that the political equations in Bengal will soon be like those in Kerala. Only if she joins or allies with the Congress, can she have a realistic chance of saving herself from political irrelevance.

 Until she decides on this crucial question, all the noise she makes in the coming months will only be of limited political consequence ? for herself and for the state. The debacle in the Lok Sabha polls has made her followers jittery and demoralized. The local elections this year will be used to get them back in action. But small local gains would mean little if she fails to take the real big decision. 

 At the moment, though, she shows no signs of accepting the reality on the ground. In 2001, she was the one who was sought after by a Congress keen to wean her away from the BJP. It is her turn now to show the keenness. Otherwise, she may call bandhs, organize civil disobedience programmes and do sundry other noisy things and still be politically inconsequential.

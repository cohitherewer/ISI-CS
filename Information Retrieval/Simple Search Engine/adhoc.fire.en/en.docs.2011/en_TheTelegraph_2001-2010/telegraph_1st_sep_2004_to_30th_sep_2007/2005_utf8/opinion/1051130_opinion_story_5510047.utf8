 Letters to Editor

 Uncomfortable silence

 Sir ? In ?The woman question? (Nov 28) Rajashri Dasgupta rightly raises a finger at the role of the media. When it was time to extend support to Kushboo, against whom politicians and the self-appointed moral guardians of Tamil culture had declared war, the media allowed the matter to snowball into a major controversy through its reports on the anti-Kushboo ?movement?. It is only recently that a few newspapers have come out with strong editorials, but these do not condemn the agitation against her. The media suddenly seems to have woken up to freedom of speech, but is this freedom applicable only to the media? Does it exist for people like Kushboo, who, as a woman, seems to be denied of this constitutional guarantee? The problem is not specific either to Kushboo, or to women in Tamil Nadu. It seems to be a peculiar problem faced by women throughout India.

 Yours faithfully,

Amitava Banerjee, Chennai

 Sir ? The furore over Kushboo refuses to subside. Political parties seem to have solved all critical problems, like eve-teasing, female infanticide, crime against women, corruption in the government, unemployment and so on. Thus, with ample time on their hands, the self-appointed guardians of morality have chosen to create an issue out of Kushboo?s remarks on pre-marital sex. It is ironical that as many as 23 cases were filed against her, whereas the same people turn a blind eye to the vulgarity that passes off as entertainment on the south Indian TV channels. This reeks of hypocrisy and backwardness, which undermine our claims of being a dynamic society. 

 Yours faithfully,

Priyanka Aich, Calcutta

 Sir ? For the interminable months that Kushboo withstood attacks for her comments, it was P. Chidambaram alone who came out in open support for her. Sania Mirza seemed to have stood up for her initially, but quickly retreated to her ?good-Indian-girl-with-Islamic-values? image. It seems Indian women are still not free to speak their minds. What if Rajnikant had made such a remark about pre-marital sex among Indian males? Would he have been greeted with eggs too?

 Yours faithfully,

Medha Dutt, Calcutta

 Sir ? A civil society entails that its citizens enjoy freedom of speech and expression, albeit with certain restrictions. (?Eggs and slippers greet Kushboo?, Nov 17). But the opposition to Kushboo?s comments were definite signs of a repressive society enforcing more repression. Kushboo?s comments were innocuous enough to do without such bloodletting. The youth of the present generation have their own beliefs and should be allowed to decide what is healthy for them.

 Yours faithfully,

Amit V. Sengupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? The statements issued by Women?s World (India), some leftist women?s organizations and actor Suhashini Manirathnam are welcome (?Kushboo gets a breather?, Nov 19). It is strange how a personal opinion has been politicized and turned into a debate on the ?virtuous Tamil woman?. The word ?culture? conveys different meanings to different people in different societies. But throwing chappals, rotten eggs, and tomatoes at a woman is certainly not part of any culture. 

 Yours faithfully,

Suman Barthakur, Guwahati

 Sir ? Why should Kushboo?s comment invite such wrath from the moral police? Was she asking anybody to follow her strictures on sex? An adult has the right to indulge in any act, provided he or she takes full responsibility for it. The media and the political parties are making a mountain out of a mole-hill. It is time the chapter was closed.

 Yours faithfully,

Mahesh Kumar, New Delhi

 Sir ? It is hard to believe that an adult had to appear in court for a personal comment that did not defame anyone. Kushboo?s statement reflects the inner voice of a majority of adults in this country today. The law courts should not waste their valuable time in addressing such trivialities.

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir ? It would not be prudent to make any generalizations from Kushboo?s statement on pre-marital sex. A recent survey stated that most Indian men and women have a minimum number of sex partners and they experience their first sexual act only after marriage. Indian culture endorses that the relationship between the husband and the wife rests on mutual trust. If either of them is not a virgin, they should disclose this before marriage. If such a vital information is not shared, the partner should be allowed to end the marriage without too much hassle. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Hara Lal Chakraborty, Calcutta 

 Sir ? It is thoroughly satisfying to know that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the left parties have lent support to Kushboo. One fails to understand how the star defamed the petitioners by her personal views, when sex-related surveys also establish the factuality of her remarks. The Mahabharata records Karna?s birth as Kunti?s child conceived before her marriage. So the issue is clearly not new in Hindu mythology. It would be preferred if the legal system accepted a written reply to the petition first before issuing summons.

 Yours faithfully,

 Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

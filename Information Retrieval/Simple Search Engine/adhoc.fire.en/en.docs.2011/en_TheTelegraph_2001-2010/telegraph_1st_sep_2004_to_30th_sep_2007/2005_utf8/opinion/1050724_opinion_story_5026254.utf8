 DARK AMBROSIA

 In the culture of its origins, the Aztec, chocolate was referred to as the food of the gods. Thus it is not surprising in modern civilization that dark chocolate is good for the heart. This discovery has two different, even contradictory, aspects to it. In the modern West, it has been believed, especially in sophisticated urban circles, that the best access to a woman?s heart is through a box of chocolates. A tastefully packed box of Lady Godiva makes a fair lady?s heart all a-flutter. Chocolate has become an integral part of Western dating and courtship etiquette. The practice varies from a shared bar of Kit Kat between two teenagers to an expensive box full of dark chocolate from the house of Valrhona given by a young man to his lady love. Chocolate has become part of dining habits: a box of mints or petit four after dinner is de rigeur for fine dining. But now, if the latest medical research is to be accepted, chocolate is acquiring functions which go far beyond the lover?s gesture and the gastronome?s delight.

 A study published by the American Heart Association states that dark chocolate can actually lower blood pressure. This action is a function of compounds, called flavonids, found in chocolates. Chocolates thus serve not only to win a lady?s heart but they are good for the heart in general. No wonder the Aztecs, in their wisdom, held that chocolates were something that could be offered to god. The conquistadores of the West destroyed this wisdom, and then through an ironic twist of history, the West discovered the powers of chocolate. From sheer delight, chocolate is poised to become a medicine. This will bring a smile to the faces of chocolate manufacturers and chocolate lovers. This joy should not take away from what actually the medical research is saying. Not all kinds of chocolate are good for the heart, but only dark chocolate is. This point is not without importance.

 Most of the common brands of chocolate that are readily consumed off the shelves are not of the dark variety. They are what is known in the trade as ?milk chocolate?, which means that the cocoa content in those chocolates is low. In India, milk chocolates and chocolates mixed with other ingredients like nuts and fruits are so popular that dark chocolates are difficult to find. Dark chocolates, like most good things of life, are an acquired taste. Not many take to the pleasantly bitter taste of the dark brown chocolate. Most prefer the sweetened form. The Aztecs would have turned up their noses at such a concoction. They drank their chocolate, and they drank it in its dark unsweetened form.

 Despite modern man?s fascination with it, chocolate retains some of its ancient mysteries. This is invoked in the name given to the latest discovery of the house of Valrhona. The name is the Sanskrit word manjari meaning bouquet. It is made from 100 per cent criollo beans, from a single plantation in the Indian Ocean, the location of which is a house secret.

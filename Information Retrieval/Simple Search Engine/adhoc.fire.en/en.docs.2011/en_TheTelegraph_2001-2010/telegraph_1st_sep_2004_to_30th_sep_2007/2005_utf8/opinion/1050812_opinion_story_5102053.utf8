 FOR A SPACE OF ONE?S OWN

 Those who marched ahead

 The Narrow Corridor: Moments in a Woman?s Life 

 By Muriel Wasi,

 Promilla, Rs 295

 I have not been taught by Muriel Wasi, but I have read her articles and have been impressed by the clarity and coherence of her thoughts and the boldness of her expression. Long before women in India became vocal about a space of their own, she got it and retained it with ?lan. The Narrow Corridor is a collection of essays, written over a period of time, which offer a rare insight into the mind of a woman of substance who combined a sensitive perception with intelligent thinking and fine expression.

 The twelve essays in this book are divided into two sections. The first section, made up of eight essays, is very personal and offers the reader an intimate picture of the author?s formative years. 

 To quote from the foreword by Ramchandra Gandhi, ?The autobiographical writings reveal a sensitive soul and a probing, independent mind. As one reads these essays, one realizes that they were written at a time when India was trying to shake off her colonial fetters. Wasi belonged to a generation which used colonial education against the British and this is reflected in comments like this one, ?Ever since Jallianwalla Bagh the political talk at the dining table had been scornful of the Government, and General Dyer had assumed in my mind the steel-trap image of Edward Fox playing him sixty years later?.?

 Some individuals are contented with what they get, happy in the security of their own groove. Others are not willing to compromise till they achieve what they are looking for in life. They live life on their own terms, never mind the difficulties on the way. The author belongs to the second category, constantly striving to forge ahead with her work at a time when the world around her was fraught with the macrocosmic turmoil of World War II and India was then struggling to shake off colonial rule.

 The reader may wonder about the title of the book till he gets to read the essay with the same title. The key sentence in the essay tells one a lot about the core of an individual?s being ??In all of us there is a narrow corridor that runs alongside the wider area of our chaotic public lives, and that contains our most private selves.? One has to explore this narrow corridor within ourselves to be able to delve into the depths of our own being in order to attain some degree of self- realization.

 It is not that all the essays in the book are profound. Yet there is something about them that will haunt the reader long after he has finished reading them. Is it the blend of the personal and the philosophical that gives these essays their unique flavour? Perhaps, but there is more to them than just this. The discriminating reader will realize that long before feminism became an elitist fad in India, there were women like Muriel Wasi who took their own decisions and did their own thing without too much fanfare.

 Another thing to watch out for is The Narrow Corridor?s quality of prose, which one does not come across too often these days. It is important for the youth today to connect with the ideals that inspired the freedom struggle, and the first few decades of independence, so as not to slide away into a neo-colonial frame of mind that multinationals as well as a certain sections of the media are trying to usher in.

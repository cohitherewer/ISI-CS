 NO COMEBACKS

 The return of a phenomenon never quite captures the imagination as the debut appearance. The former Indian captain, Sourav Ganguly, is struggling to return to form and to the Indian team. When he does, there will be none of the excitement that gripped his fans when he drove his way to a century at Lord?s in 1996 and made himself an integral part of the Indian team. There will be more of a sense of relief than excitement. If he fails, there will be disappointment but the scale of the disappointment will be nowhere near the despair that would have hit his fans if he had failed and been dropped when he was at the peak of his form. A return is never like the original. Last night, Amitabh Bachchan returned to the small screen with his very popular quiz programme. But this return had none of the suspense of the first time. In 2000, when he first hosted the show, Kaun Banega Crorepati, there was a buzz about how he would fare on a television quiz show. Would his charisma overwhelm the participants and thereby the programme? But as the programme passed through its initial phase with flying colours, the tall man?s cultivated mannerisms, his easy graciousness with his participants, his chatty style and so on became integral parts of the show. This time round, those qualities will form the core attraction of the programme but not be a part of the anticipation. Good, bad or indifferent, Bachchan?s handling of the programme will forever be compared to his first appearance. The second or the third or whatever will always be a return.

 The problem of returns is also present in the world of politics. Think of the redoubtable Winston Churchill. In the general elections after World War II, Churchill lost. He came back to the premiership again in 1951, but the second innings had none of the grip and the power of the first prime ministership. Even the famous Churchill wit that had withered opponents in the past seemed to be lacking its rapier-like sharpness. During the second premiership, most people humoured a great leader obviously in decline. Indira Gandhi, upon her return in 1980 after the Janata fiasco, never reached the heights of popularity that she had touched in the early Seventies. There have been very few remarkable returns in politics. After the first success, there is no other.

 Sometimes, the attempt to return is laced with pathos. Witness Charles Chaplin?s return to cinema in The Countess from Hong Kong. The film was poor and Chaplin?s own attempts to recapture some of his old comic turns bore all the marks of the fading clown which he had made Buster Keaton enact in Limelight. Success has its own logic and momentum. Recapturing the original success can only be informed by a sense of d?j? vu. A second coming holds promise precisely because it is an ever-receding horizon. Once it happens, it has the ring of the familiar which is the opiate of the imagination.

 DISQUIET IN THE HILLS

 Vivek Chhetri

 Subash Ghisingh has been in politics since 1964. But for the high-profile hill leader, the first real success of his career came only on July 1, when the Centre and the West Bengal government accepted his demand to bring the Darjeeling hills under the purview of the Sixth Schedule, hitherto meant only for the tribal-dominated areas of the North-east. This may sound surprising, but Ghisingh?s politics has never been about fulfilling people?s aspirations or pursuing their demands, but about furthering his personal agenda. 

 The birth of the Gorkha National Liberation Front in April 1980 fanned popular sentiments which Ghisingh successfully channelized into a violent agitation. But as a leader of the Gorkha community in India, Ghisingh has always been found wanting. Ghisingh cried hoarse with his demand for Gorkhaland in the initial phases of the movement, but mellowed down when the agitation was at its peak in 1986, putting the ?identity of the Gorkhas? before the statehood demand.

 Given the scale of the movement for a separate state, the formation of the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council was expected, and definitely cannot be deemed an achievement for Ghisingh. After all, the DGHC was just an amalgamation of the existing hill development council and zilla parishad.

 Ghisingh, however, defended his decision to accept the DGHC by telling the people that the word ?Gorkha? in the name of the council was itself an acknowledgement of identity. Issues like constitutional guarantee, which would have given the council the stamp of permanency, never figured on his agenda.

 Ghisingh?s forte has been his ability to jump from one issue to another, the last being the demand for the delimitation of the Darjeeling Lok Sabha constituency. Although Ghisingh boycotted the general elections on the issue, he has not pursed the demand.

 Guilty of omission

 Given Ghisingh?s track record, it can be safely said that he will soon overcome his intransigence over the demand for granting tribal status to all of the hill community, including the Brahmins, and incorporating the Bengali-dominated Siliguri sub-division within the area to be given special status under the Sixth Schedule. 

 But the negotiations will also be a test of the state?s and the Centre?s sincerity. The state government will have to vest more powers in the new district council to be set up as per the provisions of the Sixth Schedule. Unless the hill people are given true autonomy, there will continue to be separatist voices from the hills, giving leaders like Ghisingh bargaining powers. Remember, the failure of the DGHC was also to an extent owing to the insincerity of the state government, which over the years gave Ghisingh a free hand to run the powerless body. For how does one explain that despite the DGHC having the authority to appoint employees in the Group C and D categories, not a single appointment has been made since the council was formed? The lack of employment opportunity is only helping the cause of separatism.

 More appallingly, Ghisingh was allowed to use DGHC funds according to his whims and fancies. Even the mandatory general council and executive council meetings, which must discuss and approve all development projects, have not been held since 2001. The DGHC budget was not tabled at these meetings for years, yet the state government chooses to remain silent but for alleging from time to time that the DGHC is ridden with corruption.

 True, special status under the Sixth Schedule will make the new body stronger and empower it with more legislative, financial and, to an extent, judiciary powers. But if Ghisingh is let loose once again, it will be only a matter of time before another impasse occurs.

 Letters to Editor

 Half-way house

 Sir ? The left is behaving like the bride who consents to marriage but refuses to change her gotra (?Birthday snub in Karat court?, May 13). Completely outwitted by the Congress, the left now has to resort to juvenile tricks like not turning up at parties to retain whatever is left of its identity. The desperation was evident in Prakash Karat?s attempt to reimpose the party writ on over-ambitious chief ministers recently. But will all its nitpicking, complaints of violation against its partner and truancy, help the left?

 Yours faithfully,

 J.N. Chatterjee, Calcutta

 Anything but equal

 Sir ? In ?Not by science alone? (May 10), Dipankar Gupta writes, ?modernity allows for greater tolerance regarding alternative viewpoints, knowledges and lifestyles?. But this kind of modernity was also present in ancient Indian society, which was more modern than today?s world given that it allowed different view points ? Buddhist, Jain, Vedanta and Carvaka ? to flourish, interact, counteract, develop and evolve simultaneously. If tolerance for each other?s views and regarding the other as an ethical equal are what ?modernity? is made of, then the ancient Indian society was no less modern. I also disagree with Gupta that morality and ethics are different. In morality, as in the case of ethics, the ?other? does matter. Without the other there is no morality. A lone person has no necessity of being moral. Morality is a kind of accountability and obligation towards others and governs relationship between parent and child, doctor and patient, teacher and student, and so on. Each of these relation-ships is one-sided. The point is to bring them both to behave like what Gupta calls ?ethical equals?. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Madhu Kapoor, Calcutta 

 Sir ? ?Not by science alone? comes at a time when violation of ethical norms has become the order of the day. However, it is difficult to agree with Dipankar Gupta?s contention that ?social relations of modernity thrive particularly well when there is greater economic parity between people?. In my eyes, even if there is economic disparity, modern social relations can prosper if people are guided by the voice of conscience. In other words, the baser tendencies in human beings are replaced by those which are more humane. By making modernity dependent on the laws of economics, that is the market, we make it vulnerable to the shrewdness of human mind. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Nothing serious

 Sir ? The attack on the government official, Shakuntala Verma, was shocking (?Curse cuts off hands?, May 12). But more shocking was the reaction of the Madhya Pradesh chief minister, Babulal Gaur. Instead of being ashamed that such an incident occurred at all, Gaur tried to wash his hands of the matter by denying its linkage with child marriage. 

 Child marriage is a deep-rooted social evil and extreme poverty often pushes the backward classes to lighten their burden by marrying off their daughters. Verma was doing good work and that too with little cooperation from the administration. What happened to her may deter others. The administration should have been much more vigilant.

 Yours faithfully,

Koyel Basu, Calcutta

 Sir ? By declaring that even Mahatma Gandhi could not eradicate child marriage, Babulal Gaur makes known his lack of commitment to the state?s development. As chief minister, he cannot shirk his duties.

 Yours faithfully,

 Anuradha Adhikary, Calcutta

 WRITING ON THE ROCKS

 MALVIKA SINGH

 It is after three years that I am in a village, on top of a hill, on the outskirts of Manali, facing snow ranges all around me. On my last visit, the spectacular rocks that stand here like sentinels guarding nature had been assaulted with garish slogans, predominantly ?selling? Coke and Pepsi. An angry column, on my return, had brought the mutilation of our shared natural environment to the notice of the Supreme Court which acted instantly with vigour and reprimand. They ruled strongly against both companies, and Coke and Pepsi had to pay to get the rocks cleaned of all their gunge by scientific conservation methods. Congratulations. What joy to drive today to the same village, Kothi, and find clean, drama-tic, age-old rocks. 

 But, nothing is ever perfect. Now the government is doing the damage. The agencies in charge of the roads in Himachal have painted road signs and warnings on the same rocks as has some SK company. The unthinking babu and a foolish businessman running amuck. Back with the complaint to the Supreme Court.

 Then again, a bright red chopper stands here to carry people into the clouds to have a look at the snow?so unnecessary in areas such as this because it is an eyesore and its sound an earsore. Where are the environment and tourism plans that will take people into hitherto unexplored and pristine areas without damaging those wild spaces? We all have a right to visit but we have to abide by stringent wild space norms and not carry the trappings of city life and the bazaars of urban India into nature. What junk governments endorse and permit.

 Return to nature

 Building norms, for one, seem totally absent here. With prosperity, and a boom in travel, everyone is building anything and everything, everywhere. It is scary and sad. In this wonderful state of Himachal, it would be so easy to create beautiful built environments using the traditional building methods, using slate, brick et al, reinforcing thereby the tried and tested designs, proportions and materials of the manmade space. But no. Anything goes. The worst of the plains is being aped. All rules are broken and wherever you ask why this is happening, the locals say that their MLA is inflicting the horror, to bring prosperity to the people. Forests are being cut. The rulers and administrators are destroying the very strengths of this state that make it special. They are replacing the many specialities of the area with robotization influenced by what goes on in the characterless plains that have been bastardized by the PWDs and the CPWDs.

 How about a new and simple scheme? Pay village communities to plant forests on the bald desecrated hills and award them if the trees that they plant achieve maturity. Get economically marginal communities to restore and then nurture degraded lands and forests and pay them to do so. Get NGOs to put in traditional naturopathy centres of herbal medicines and get the local people to run them. Rebuild their pride in their traditional skills. Get these very communities to cultivate the special herbs and medicinal plants they are so familiar with, a science they understand better than most, and help market the produce for them. Reinforce the infrastructure that they require. Give them interest-free loans and tax benefits for such activities. And, stem the loopholes that are exploited today by land and timber mafias at the cost of the local citizens.

 These are the kinds of initiatives that need to be taken by all those so-called do-gooders who are desperately trying to enact a new return land to tribals bill. Ban all felling of trees and any sale or lease of such lands, compel their renewal by the tribals themselves, monitor the enhancement of hitherto degraded forests and lands, then see how the lobbies react.

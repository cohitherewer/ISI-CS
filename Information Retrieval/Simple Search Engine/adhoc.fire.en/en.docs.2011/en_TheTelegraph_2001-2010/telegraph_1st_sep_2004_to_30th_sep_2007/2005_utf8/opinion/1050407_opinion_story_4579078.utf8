 ALWAYS A HAPPENING CITY

 Those who saw the Sixties will agree that Calcutta has had a night life before, and a more dignified one than now, writes Sumanta Sen

 Nothing remains of those days

 Calcutta, one is told, has now become a ?happening? place. Well, Calcutta has always been a vibrant city, so what?s new? The explanation lies in the meaning of the word ?happening?. It applies only to the goings-on at clubs and discos, noisy and dimly-lit establishments. These have proliferated particularly south of Park Street and their attractions are believed to be behind many crimes committed in the city and its outskirts. If you don?t have the money to shake a leg at these places, no problem, rob your parents.

 There are some who would like to ignore this fallout and gloat over the city having at last become ?adult?. While that is an issue which can be debated endlessly, discos and clubs do bring back memories of a time when things too ?happened?, but gracefully. The culture then was genteel, bhadralok. In the watering holes of yesteryear, the atmosphere was no different from that outside; there was no conflict or tension. Even then, there was no shortage of money, but flaunting it was not encouraged. Calcutta was very much adult, and one with a sense of responsibility.

 Take for instance, the Shaw Brothers or Chota Bristol, as it has always been affectionately known because of its location behind the once-popular Bristol hotel which ceased to exist a long time ago. The atmosphere there was middle class. At six every evening, the proprietors and employees would shut their eyes and offer a silent prayer to the deity for a minute. During that minute no customer would shout out his order and conversation almost stopped. It was almost as if they were sitting in their own drawing-rooms and if there was no blowing of the conch-shell, that was just a minor departure which could be ignored.

 Calcutta has never had a Damon Runyon and hence no sketches of the characters at such places. A regular at Chota Bristol used to be a dhoti-clad gentleman, who left every night on a rickshaw carrying a glass of rum to drink on his way home. When he returned the next evening, he would hand back the glass and would again depart with it. He claimed that the glass had never broken. Among the other regulars were Chinmoy Lahiri, a very pleasant man who only got a bit ruffled if asked to sing. ?Singing is my profession and when I come here I leave my profession behind,? used to be his curt reply. Samaresh Bose appeared a bit uneasy at any discussion of his writings and preferred discussing left politics. And there was Ghoshda, who worked for CESC and would ask everybody to ?take it easy?, even when there was no hint of trouble. Supervising all this would be brothers Dinu and Madhu, humble servants of the babus even though they owned the place.

 Chota Bristol continues to prosper but the atmosphere, one is told, has changed. It had to change because attitudes have changed. Would there be a Hari Mukherjee today, entering Olympia and ordering drinks all round because ?Last night Ma (the goddess) told me in my sleep, ?Hari, Bengalis are dying of thirst and you are not doing anything about this???

 Olympia is no more. A pity. Though vastly different from Chota, it also enjoyed a middle-class ambience. There was Satu Sen, who appeared morose one evening as he had received a very short short story from Niranjan Mazumdar for a periodical he had brought out. Mazumdar?s explanation had been, ?Satu, one more line and it would have become an epic.? Sen was a Lohiaite who had run into money selling scrap paper, and like most other Bengalis, had invested the funds in intellectual pursuit. It perhaps did not have a happy ending.

 There was Gopal Ghosh, sketching away madly one evening and throwing away the efforts, each bearing the name of the place and the time of the evening. The last one he threw away read, ?Olympia, raat anek.? Nobody disturbed him, there was no scramble for the papers; that would have been seen as undignified. Ghosh was certainly a celebrity but Calcutta then didn?t have its celebrity hunters. One used to hear from old-timers how Chhabi Biswas held court at Bower on Bentinck Street, but there was never an occasion when the management had to ask for police protection. As for the management, even in bigger establishments, they had the middle class in mind. For instance, at the Embassy in Grand Hotel in the Sixties and Seventies, even impoverished reporters could have a drink once a month at Rs 5 a peg. The price was high but not exorbitant.

 It was, of course, not all middle class. Golden Slippers opposite Nizam?s was for the rich, as also the world of Princes, Maxims or Le Gourmet ? a world of exotic dances performed by artistes from abroad and advertised in the newspapers. But that world caused no heartaches to those kept out of it. There were no cases of theft or murder in order to be incognito or a tantrik in air-conditioned comfort. One saw people in evening dress walking into Firpo?s but there was no craving to be a part of the set. The young, irrespective of the class they belonged to, had no place in that world and so, in college, one did not sit next to a fellow student to hear tales of the ?forbidden world?. Today such tales abound, the glossy pages are full of the ?happenings? at this or that place and the electronic media brings home live the goings-on. The less fortunate feel left out, whether they are in Ballygunge, Behala or Baghbazar.

 Nostalgia is often laughed at and perhaps this piece will also be. But those who have lived those days would agree that there was an element of quiet dignity that marked evening life then, and which perhaps is not there in today?s night life. The present generation may say, ?Who wants to be quiet? This is the age of moving forward.? Motion there certainly is and in large measure. But forward? That question mark can lead to another debate best avoided. My only humble opinion is that Calcutta was not a dead place, and it is not just in the last couple of years that things have started to happen here. Earlier also there was life and not perhaps a less enjoyable one.

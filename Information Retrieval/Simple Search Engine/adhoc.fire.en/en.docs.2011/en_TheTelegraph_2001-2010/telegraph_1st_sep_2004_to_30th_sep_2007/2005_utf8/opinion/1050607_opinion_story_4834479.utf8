 BLIND GROWTH

 Cities have their unique ways of destroying the world. And the flow of people into them will only increase all over the world. The United Nations secretary general has predicted, on World Environment Day last Sunday, that more than 60 per cent of the earth?s population will live in cities by 2030, up from almost half now and just a third in 1950. Calcutta has also grown as part of this process of rapid urbanization. But how does a city ?grow?? Is it simply a question of more people, houses and cars, or is the ?development? of a city a more systematic process of planning and implementation, motivated by an informing and evolving vision? More people and a wider spread is certainly the basis of Calcutta?s growth. But the saddest, and most dangerous, aspect of Calcutta?s burgeoning has been a lack of vision behind its development. Railing against flyovers and shopping malls is the standard way of voicing civic discontent in Calcutta. But the real extent of this civic and municipal failure goes well beyond just a reductive and mindlessly cosmetic approach to urban development.

 It lies in the absolute politicization of every civic value and municipal activity in the city and its suburbs. A civic consciousness, and its translation into action, is almost entirely subsumed within partisan politics. Apolitical urban activism, led by civil society, is all but marginal ? at best, an elite form of consciousness. Killing pollution of every kind, dwindling greens and waterbodies, indiscriminate construction, perilous waste disposal, congested roads and unusable footpaths, inadequate water supply ? every cause for civic despair and alarm in the city has become virtually irredeemable because of the political culture that prevails not only in the Writers? Buildings but also in the corporation and municipalities. The culture is characterized by corruption, cluelessness and mayoral exhibitionism ? the last, a flamboyant promotion of hideousness and uselessness for the sake of political and personal profit. (Witness the new public toilets and fountains.) Another dangerous failing is an inability to handle huge sums of money given to Calcutta by the Centre or funding bodies like the Asian Development Bank for basic work to be done in the city. This, again, is a combination of corruption and radical inefficiency. A city grown by politicians and not by its citizens is heading in a wrong direction.

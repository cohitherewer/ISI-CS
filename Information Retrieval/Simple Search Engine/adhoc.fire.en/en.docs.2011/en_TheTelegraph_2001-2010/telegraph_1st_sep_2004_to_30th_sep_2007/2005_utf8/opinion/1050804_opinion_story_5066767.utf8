 IN THE NAME OF JUSTICE

 Beena Sarwar

 Three frozen moments of grief, captured by wire photographs last week, stand out ? anguished families in Brazil, Kashmir, and Iraq. They will be forever linked not just by their personal tragedies but also by the fact that their losses are a consequence and part of the so-called global ?war on terror?.

 The pictures feature wailing women, and a little girl of eleven named Noor, nearly senseless with grief at the loss of her father, a member of the Iraqi army shot dead in Kirkuk. A mother in Brazil and relatives in Kashmir weep for the loss of young men killed by security forces in cases of mistaken identity. 

 From London to Kashmir? In London, police chased a suspect wearing a bulky jacket, then reportedly held him down. He was later identified as Jean Charles de Menezes, 27, a Brazilian electrician, and not a ?Muslim terrorist?. On the Indian side of the line of control, security forces shot dead three teenage boys, out for a late night, post-wedding jaunt ? the second such killing in one week, the last one being that of a 15-year old boy.

 It is not that the British police forces have never killed innocent people before. Injustice, a powerful documentary film by Ken Fero and Tariq Mehmood, reports on the deaths in custody and of people who happen to be mostly black. 

 Licence to kill

 Now, of course, there is ?khulli chutt? (an open licence) sanctioned by the global ?war on terror?. Around the world, security agencies are following the cue of the bully on the world block. It helps them deal with their own political dissent, win elections, and keep up the national hype.

 And around the world, once relaxed lifestyles are changing as the new paradigms of ?terror? take hold. Luis P. Ferraz, a Brazilian friend returning to Sao Paulo from Karachi via London, wonders if he should carry his backpack, especial- ly since his passport shows that he has just been in Pakistan. 

 And who can blame them for being paranoid! Last Sunday, armed police in New York entered an open-top sightseeing bus, handcuffed five Sikh tourists from Birmingham and forced them to kneel on Broadway after a tour company employee reported them to be ?suspicious?. The mayor later apologized to the five men.

 Paranoia has even reached Scandinavian countries. Farooq Sulehra from Sweden, which is considering new anti-terrorism laws, writes: ?Denmark is on high alert. The Norwegian media... has gone nuts ... As far as ordinary people are concerned... at least the few I talked to, have expressed nervousness. I think the media is also spreading nervousness...?

 Not so white

 We in Pakistan are used to bomb attacks and armed gunmen mowing down congregations. Britain is also not a stranger to home-grown terrorism, having lived through enough bombings and assassinations over the last thirty years while dealing with the IRA. But the IRA activists were indistinguishable from the generally ?white? population, so racial profiling was difficult, if not impossible. 

 Today, anyone who has dark skin, dark hair and brown eyes is a potential suspect and fair game. Apologies can come later. We count the people killed by suicide bombers in the Western capitals, but the thousands of Afghans and Iraqis killed by bombs dropped from the skies go unaccounted for. 

 As the Canadian-Pakistani writer Tarek Fateh notes, ?Both Bush and Bin Laden have fed off each other, providing sustenance to one another in implementing their agendas... To fight malaria, one does not shoot down mosquitoes; one drains the swamps. Sadly, the Anglo-American ?War on Terrorism? has done just the opposite.? The swamp is now the world, and everyone is fair game.

 A TWIST IN THE TALE

 Gwynne Dyer

 First they flipped, and then they flopped. Last week, the Shia Arab and Kurdish parties that dominate the transitional government of Iraq tried to rig the outcome of the constitutional referendum on October 15 by sabotaging the voting in the four provinces where Sunni Arabs are the majority. The original voting rules said that if three of those four provinces voted against the new constitution by a two-thirds majority, it would fail. Instead, the ruling Shias and Kurds declared that it would pass unless two-thirds of all the registered voters in those provinces rejected it.

 That was an impossibly high hurdle, designed to make sure that Sunni votes could not block the new constitution. It was so unfair that even the United States of America, which desperately wants the constitution to pass, brought pressure on the Shia-Kurdish government to reverse its course. So the Baghdad government announced that the old counting rules would be reinstated. 

 It doesn?t make any difference because the Sunni Arabs were unlikely to muster a two-thirds majority against the constitution in three of those four provinces. In three of the four, there are substantial Shia and other minorities, most of whom will vote ?yes?, so practically every Sunni would have to vote ?no? to reach the two-thirds majority. 

 Stark choices

 They are unlikely to do that, because the insurgents who dominate those provinces have demanded a boycott of the referendum and threatened to kill anyone who does vote, so many Sunnis will stay home on October 15. So the constitution will probably pass after all and it still won?t make any difference.

 The resistance is concentrated in the Sunni-dominated central provinces because the Sunni-Arab minority are the only part of the population that has a strong sense of pan-Arab nationalism. They will not accept the legitimacy of a constitution that was ratified by the Kurds of the north (who have no interest in Arab politics and want a separate state) and by the Shia Arabs of the south (who look more to their fellow Shias in Iran than to the Sunni-dominated Arab world).

 When initial US illusions about Iraq were blown away by a growing resistance movement and the American authorities were forced to engage with the realities of Iraqi politics, they faced two choices.

 Tough road ahead

 They could find a new Iraqi strongman, drawn from the traditional ruling Sunni-Arab minority, and let him run Iraq for them. Or they could work with the Kurds and Shia Arabs who would cooperate if they were assured a free election that would let them use their numbers to dominate Iraq.

 The choice was a no-brainer, and by early 2004, the US had made a deal with the Shia leaders to allow free elections. The result is a constitution that effectively dismantles the central government in favour of strong Kurdish and Shia regional governments that will control almost everything except defence and foreign affairs. Current oil revenues will be shared with the oil-less Sunni Arab central provinces, but revenues from future developments will go to the Kurdish and Shia governments.

 The Kurds and Shias have got what they wanted, so the constitution will pass. The Sunni Arabs have been shafted, so the insurgency will continue. There is little likelihood that the new Iraqi army, which consists overwhelmingly of Kurdish and Shia recruits, will be able to take over the task of putting down the Sunni rebellion from US forces in the foreseeable future. And when the US finally tires of fighting ?terrorists? and goes home, it is possible that Iraq will split in three.

 Which could lead to general war in the Middle East, with Iraq?s neighbours, Iran, Turkey, Syria and Saudi Arabia, all getting drawn into the conflict.

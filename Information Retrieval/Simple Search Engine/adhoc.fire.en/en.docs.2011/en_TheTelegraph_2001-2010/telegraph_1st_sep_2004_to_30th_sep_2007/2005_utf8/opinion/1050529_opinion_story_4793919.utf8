 Letters to Editor

 Poetic justice

 Sir ? It would be one of those unparalleled ironies of history if the dreaded al Qaida terrorist, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, were to die of his wounds (?Zarqawi hurt, says website?, May 25). Think about it. The most prominent leader of the Islamic jihad against what according to Zarqawi is a conspiracy against his religion by the Christian West, dying in a manner that would only confirm one of Christianity?s oft-quoted, and profusely-misapplied dictums: those who live by the sword shall die by the sword.

 Yours faithfully,

Miguel A. Guanipa, Whitinsville, US

 Tread with care 

 Sir ? The controversy surrounding Jo Bole So Nihaal begins and ends with the title itself. There is also a song with the same words as a refrain, but there too there?s little to hurt religious sentiments. If Jo Bole So Nihaal is to be banned for it, then Kuch Kuch Hota Hai should also be banned because it has a remix of ?Raghupati Raghava Raja Ram?. Like any Sunny Deol movie, Jo Bole So Nihaal too glorifies the heroic feats of its protagonist, a Sikh. The title obviously appeals to Sikh sentiments. There is no reason why they should feel alienated by the movie. Perhaps they do not like the idea of scantily-clad young women chasing the Sikh hero. The charge that the blasts in the cinema halls in New Delhi were an expression of Sikh anger thus does not ring true. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Sir ? Religion is always a sensitive matter, especially in a conservative society like ours. If film-makers think they stand a better chance at the box office by appealing to religion, then they must remember that they also run the risk of igniting strong passions. 

Yours faithfully, 

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur 

Sir ? No doubt the blasts had something to do with Jo Bole So Nihaal, as both halls were screening the film. The film has some very disturbing scenes. There is Sunny Deol chanting ?Jo bole so nihaal? and ?Sat sri akal? in a drunken state. As a constable, he is shown roughing up people mercilessly. I fail to understand why Deol needed to be a Sikh in the film and why it needed to be called Jo Bole So Nihaal. It is time to define freedom of expression clearly. Freedom of expression is not about hurting religious feelings; it should be used for the benefit of society, to speak up against social evils and injustices. Communal harmony is much more important than such freedom of expression.

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Why are film-makers choosing real-life topics for their films? Films like The Legend of Bhagat Singh and Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose: The Forgotten Hero are lowering the image of these great national figures, as people rarely buy tickets to watch them. Films should draw their subject from fiction, like Star Wars. This way, both film-makers and the public will be satisfied.

 Yours faithfully,

Kaustav Sinha, Calcutta

 More puzzles

 Sir ? A.K. Chatterjee?s ?Many puzzles in the top job? (May 20), though interesting, was short on facts. It was not possible for Bidhan Chandra Roy to have decided who would succeed Ranjit Gupta as chief secretary of West Bengal for the simple reason that he was already dead. Roy passed away on July 1, 1962, while Gupta retired as chief secretary in 1965. 

 Yours faithfully,

R. Sen, Calcutta

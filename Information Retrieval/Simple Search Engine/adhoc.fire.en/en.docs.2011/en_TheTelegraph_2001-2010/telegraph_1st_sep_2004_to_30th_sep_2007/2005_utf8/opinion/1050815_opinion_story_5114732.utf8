 STEP TO FREEDOM

 Clarity is elusive, and the Supreme Court has sat three times since last year on what appears at first sight to be a simple principle. The issue is of admissions to private educational institutions that get no government aid and minority-run institutions. The court says that the state or Central government cannot impose the rule for reservations on these institutions, although admissions there must be ?fair, transparent, non-exploitative and based on merit?. There can be no quarrel with this, and the incentive to competition that the arrangement would create would be welcome. Excellence in academics and in professional training comes easier with the desire to be ahead. The lifting of the reserved seats rule from unaided institutions and the permission to minority institutions for the admission of non-minority students ? another part of the same judgment ? could foster an atmosphere of high-minded rivalry, a competition in excellence.

 Had the issue been so simple, the Supreme Court would not have had to sit three times, followed each time by a series of petitions asking for clarifications. The most recent verdict, too, has puzzled people. For one, the court has said that committees may be formed to regulate admissions, help institutions fix their fees and guard against the charging of capitation fees. It is not clear who is to form the committee. A watchdog committee would suggest some sort of government participation. Regulation and the declared ?unfettered right? of institutions do not quite fit. Yet experience shows that the best intentions look rather ragged when translated into reality ? in Chhattisgarh 117 private universities had to be unceremoniously shut down not so long ago. It is not an easy job for policy-makers and governments to fulfil the contrary needs of an expanding educational scene, particularly when foreign universities are poised to enter. The differences in background, resources and access to education among the student population are as many as they are huge. The Centre is not yet sure whether some kind of a central body is needed to see that institutions maintain certain standards of excellence and are just to meritorious but poor students. The Supreme Court?s verdict has again brought up these questions, and shadow forth bigger ones ? about degrees of autonomy, the limits of choice and the exact equation between money and education.

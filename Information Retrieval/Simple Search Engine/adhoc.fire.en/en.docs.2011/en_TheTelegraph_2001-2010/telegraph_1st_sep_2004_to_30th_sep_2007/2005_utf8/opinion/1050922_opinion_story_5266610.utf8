 IT?S ALL IN THE NAME

 Neha Sahay

 For almost 200 years, the British ruled over us without making us change our names. Tantya Tope, Krishnamachari, Hardayal, Kripalani ? the British managed to pronounce all these. It took the Americans less than 10 years to get the urban Chinese to adopt Western names. When Deng Xiaoping ?opened up? China to the West, he invited Americans to teach English in high schools and universities in China. The prospect of identifying each one of their students by their real names was too much for the Americans, so they gave them Western names.

 Though it may be difficult to get the exact pronunciation, Chinese names are not impossible to pronounce. Obviously, the American teachers didn?t feel it necessary to waste time trying. As for the Chinese, the fact that they stuck to these names long after they ceased being students is indicative of how much they valued them. So it?s common to meet young English-speaking Chinese who introduce themselves as Tina, Angela, Emily, Melissa, Mandy, Sandy, Sophia, Avis, Catherine, Georgina, David... They had another reason not to revert to their original names.

 Reason enough

 English-speaking Chinese graduates are quickly snapped up by foreign employers. Most of these Chinese work either in multinationals, where foreigners continue to dominate top management, or in schools where Mandarin is taught to foreigners. The latter would gladly take the trouble to get the Chinese names of their teachers right, but even here, things are made easy for the whites.

 Distinct from these relatively well-off university graduates is a new generation of Chinese who?ve never studied beyond middle school. They too work in fields where knowing English is an asset. Most of them are ?migrant labour? from the interior, working in the hospitality and leisure sectors in the special economic zones of South China. Waitresses in Western-style cafes and bars, front-office staff in five-star hotels, upmarket salons, massage parlours and gyms, managerial assistants in golf clubs ? all of them have English names.

 Some of the names chosen by these youngsters are intriguing ? Water, Trillion, Fish, Lichee, Nickel, Vitamin, Canoe, Viper, Sunshine, Garfield, Stone, Fire, Amigo, Ice, Sin, Funeral, Sanitary and so on. They are chosen for their meaning (?You can?t live without water?), or because they sound like their original name. These names are too dear to them to be changed even when some Westerners point out that these are not ?names? in English. For these are rare names: given not by parents or teachers, but chosen for themselves with a lot of thought.

 Old is gold

 If people can be given Western names by foreigners, it?s hardly surprising that Chinese prefer to give upmarket properties names such as Australia Gardens, Golf Villas, Richmond Hills, Horizon Cove, Like Caf?, Money Bar, Yesterday Discotheque, Times Square...Interestingly, all these have different Mandarin names. The norm for expats is to print your visiting card with the sentence: ?Please take me to...? with the address filled in in Mandarin.

 This card is specifically to be shown to taxi drivers. The foreigners who do take the trouble of learning the Mandarin name, find the driver doesn?t understand their accent.

 In all this, last month?s order by the authorities in Kunming banning foreign names for new properties comes as a pleasant surprise. The rule has been in existence since 1997, but followed more in the breach. The Kunming Communist Party secretary?s recently articulated displeasure at the ?loss to native culture? by ?weird?? names such as ?Paris of the East Plaza? and ?French Gardens? led to its immediate enforcement. White House Mini district overnight became Zhujia Shangyu. Got that?

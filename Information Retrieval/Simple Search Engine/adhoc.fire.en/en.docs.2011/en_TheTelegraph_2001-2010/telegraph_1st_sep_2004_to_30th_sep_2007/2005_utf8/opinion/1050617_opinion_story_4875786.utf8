 TOO MUCH TO LEARN

 Neha Sahay

 Indian students feeling suicidal aren?t alone; their counterparts in China share the same feelings for the same reason: exam pressure. June 7-10 saw the College Entrance exam taken by 8 million 18-year-olds of which only half will get into university. The weeding out process is ruthless, based on the twin factors of geography and class. Beijing and Shanghai students are at an advantage because the best universities are there. Outsiders, non-residential permit holders, must score higher to get into them. This also makes competition tougher for students in these cities; so some go inland to take the exam, hoping to top there.

 The number of village students taking the exam is increasing, even though high school fees are often too high. More peasants are committing suicide because they can?t afford to give their children the chance to change their lives.

 As competition grows, shades of the sons-of-the-soil policy can be glimpsed. A newspaper asked readers whether Shenzhen university should give preference to students holding Shenzhen resident permits. 

 Early start

 As in India, it?s never too early for exam pressure to begin. The last year of middle school decides which high school the student will get into. The grade IX finals are like our board exams. But after they are over, the pressure continues. Students must spend the next three years living in high school to prevent distractions, going home only over the weekends.

 But who can defy hormones? Chinese parents are finding that living with other 15-year-olds exposes their children to the horrors of friendship with the opposite sex and even dating. So more and more parents are providing health reasons to school authorities to allow their children to be day-boarders. The health factor isn?t simply a ruse: study schedules and school food being what they are, students end up under-fed and exhausted.

 Life isn?t much easier at home. The food may be great (though the expensive fish-oil based ?memory enhancers? aren?t all that tasty), the surroundings more comfortable, and private tutors a good compensation for school teachers, notorious for humiliating all but the best students, but there?s no escape from parental pressure. One mother made it clear to her 15-year-old that friendship with boys outside school hours is a no-no.

 Hard work

 On D-Day, Chinese parents escort their children to exam centres, taking leave from work. The newspapers are full of pictures of parents waiting with haunted faces outside exam centres, some praying, others weeping. Many families check into hotels near these centres, not only to avoid commuting, but also to provide their kids with the most luxurious environment during these days. Not that commuting is a nightmare: traffic is re-routed to avoid jams near exam centres.

 Here the difference with India comes in. Acknowledging that the student?s future depends on this exam, the state does all it can to make life easier for students, including special weather forecasts and additional police patrolling to implement the ban on horns, loudspeakers and construction near exam centres. Taking their cue, society follows: volunteers help drive kids in their vehicles; taxi companies oblige superstitious parents by not sending out taxis with ?unlucky? numbers; bus companies reserve seats for students and stop wherever students flag them.

 This soul-killing, unequal exercise has been the ticket to an elite existence since 206 BC, when the Imperial Exam system originated, under which scholars memorized Confucian classics to enter civil service. Mao?s Cultural Revolution dared to abolish it, but threw out the baby with the bathwater by abolishing all higher education. A year after his death, it was back.

 GIFT OF CRUELTY

 There is something absurd, rather than grand, about an elephant being sent as a gift by one modern prime minister to another. Extravagant or bestial diplomatic gifts are an ancient tradition. Chinese, Byzantine and Moghul emperors, among others, indulged in it, and important modern museums all over the world have separate wings to exhibit these gifts, which range from the exquisite to the bizarre. But Mr Manmohan Singh should definitely think twice, even several times, before flying an elephant to his counterpart in Armenia. It is a cruel thing to do (for the elephant), and is avoidable. The creature will be flown, in some uncomfortable nether region of an aircraft, to a zoo in Armenia, where temperatures are now well below zero. Transporting animals in wretched conditions is done every day all over the world. This is done for the meat, and even with this functional justification, principled vegetarians remain appalled by what chickens and pigs have to go through. But when elephants, white tigers and horses are regularly forced to make hazardous journeys for the sake of international relations, then the gratuitousness of the whole thing begins to look rather unacceptable. Elephants are, after all, Schedule 1 animals in India, and three white tigers once died when Messrs George Fernandes and Jaswant Singh packed them off as gifts to Japan and Libya.

 Most of the feelings that Ms Maneka Gandhi expresses for animals are, quite understandably, not taken seriously. But her concern in this regard is more legitimate. Apart from other animal rights groups in Karnataka, Ms Virginia McKenna of the Born Free Foundation has also appealed to the Indian prime minister to spare the six-year-old Veda. The question is not really that of objectifying a living creature by turning it into a gift, but a simpler one of cruelty and risk ? especially when the Armenian prime minister will not really be deprived of one of life?s essentials if not presented with an elephant. Ms J. Jayalalithaa?s largesse and religiosity also sometimes fasten themselves on elephants. But this does not involve physical cruelty to the animals, making it one of this lady?s less culpable excesses, whatever its political implications. Mr Singh, who likes to be unobtrusive in public, might wish to reconsider the use of elephants ? or any other delicate and exotic animal, for that matter ? to make polite exchanges with his peers in other countries.

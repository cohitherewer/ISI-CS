 A LITTLE MONEY HERE, AND A LITTLE FAVOUR THERE

 Bribe has long been a part of India?s socio-political life. And yet, a collective hypocrisy stops us from acknowledging this, writes Sumanta Sen

 No big deal

 Christmas is round the corner but it is not so much a season of peace and goodwill as one of scams. First, there were the revelations in the Volcker report and then a spy camera had members of parliament involved in a cash-for-question scandal. In common parlance, what was involved in both cases was the giving and taking of bribe. And bribe has been so common a feature of Indian political and social life since time immemorial that such reports do not mean much to the man on the street. Driving through a Patna street when Bofors had become an election issue, a driver heard slogans such as; ?Rajiv bhai, Rajiv bhai, tope dalali kisne khai? and remarked to himself, ?Arey bhai, bina dalali kuch kam hota hai? (Can one get anything done without paying the middleman?)

 Implicit in the remark was an acceptance of the fact that underhand deals are a part of life and there is no point in getting excited over these. The word ?ghoos? does sound bad, but what about ?utkoch?? It is a word to be found in Sanskrit literature and appears to be entirely respectable. 

 In Mrichhakatik, for instance, a rajshyalak (king?s brother in law) demands utkoch, but it is not made to appear unnatural, nor is the fellow shown to be a greater bounder than he is just because he makes the demand.

 With time, the term came to be changed to the more handy ?upri?, or extra, and society accepted such payment not with a sense of resignation but as a natural perquisite for a salaried person. As one of Premchand?s characters told his still upright son, ?Salary is like the full moon, it slowly dies away but ghoos is like the flowing river which is always there to quench your thirst.? 

 A government job, in particular, has always been preferred over others for the upri that comes with it; remember the girl in Mrinal Sen?s Bhuvan Shome? Neither in the short story, nor in the film was the character a figment of her creator?s imagination. Rather, she represented the common perception in society. And why speak of only commoners? There are strong suggestions that a person of Rammohan Roy?s eminence had been found to be a bit careless with funds belonging to the East India Company while functioning as one of its agents. And could his friend, Dwarakanath Tagore, have been entirely on the right when he built his princely estate while being in the employ of the same company?

 A tolerant and realistic society had not bothered about such things and does not do even now. But that is the society of the ordinary citizen, not yet affected by hypocrisy. It is different with the upper echelons. Not that they are any more honest, but they insist that they must be seen as adhering to the message of satyameva jayate. It is known the world over that no international deal can be transacted without the payment of commissions, and yet people are always trying to score political points by ?exposing? them. Thus Bofors made an issue without, as has now transpired, an iota of evidence against Rajiv Gandhi. In fact, no proper inquiry was allowed to be conducted into whether arms can be purchased without some cut money changing hands. It is the same about the oil purchase from Iraq. If the Iraqis had demanded, and received, extra payment they were just playing the game by its rules. Other countries obviously understand this and so the report has evoked little interest in Britain, France and elsewhere. But in India a holier-than-thou attitude must be adopted. For, aren?t we a society untouched by corruption and other such evils? Incidentally, neither in the case of the Bofors cannon nor that of the oil coupons was national interest jeopardized ? the guns are good and the oil never posed any threat to the country?s security.

 So how is the ordinary man affected? Even if at some future date it is found that Rajiv Gandhi or Natwar Singh or people close to them had been indiscreet, what difference will that make to life which cannot be led without greasing palms? Take the case of drivers of public vehicles. Every day they have to please the traffic cops even when they have not committed any offence. Go to a government or a municipal office to get some work done, and the first thing you will be told is the rate of payment.

 But these are small matters. What happens at election time? The statement of expense that a candidate furnishes is blatantly inflated as the actual expenditure is there for everyone to see. Equally farcical is the declaration of assets. Here there is no direct involvement of bribes, but the telling of lies is no less forgivable. Yet, on the floor of the house, the same worthies who lie at the drop of a hat sit in judgment over others. The same goes for the judiciary, given the number of judges who have been hauled up over the last few years .

 Here one is not suggesting for a moment that the guilty should not be punished. But while this is done, the others should not behave as if some hitherto unheard of offence has been committed. Indeed, for the most part, those who are seen as honest are so because they have never been exposed to temptations. This was borne out amply during the National Democratic Alliance regime. People who were thought to be squeaky clean were seen lapping up the goodies as soon as the opportunity presented itself. And in a totally corrupt environment, there can be no dearth of such opportunities.

 Now the cash-for-question business. This has been going on since 1952, with nobody asking any questions. If that was bad, what is worse is the false sense of indignation which greeted the visuals. False, because the knowledge was not new, but it had been kept under wraps till the camera intervened. There has been a suggestion that those revealing such dirty deals should also be looked into. Generally speaking, it is not a bad idea, given that certain members of the Fourth Estate have also been known to hobnob far more than is necessary with those in power. The media, which occupy a high moral ground, should also be open to probes.

 Some of the ?exposed? MPs have reportedly claimed that they accepted money for their party. Here the Indian political establishment can perhaps follow the Brits. Their political parties accept money from the rich and ambitious and in return, make them lords and knights. Why cannot the same practice be introduced in the country which has adopted the Westminster model? 

 Some of the Padma awards can be kept aside for the highest bidders. This will certainly bring greater transparency in the conferring of such awards and also explain how some of the funds that parties always have at their disposal make their way into their coffers. But try and suggest this to our leaders and immediately the collective hypocrisy will raise its head, screaming that this will be against Indian culture. Just as every crime is against our culture.

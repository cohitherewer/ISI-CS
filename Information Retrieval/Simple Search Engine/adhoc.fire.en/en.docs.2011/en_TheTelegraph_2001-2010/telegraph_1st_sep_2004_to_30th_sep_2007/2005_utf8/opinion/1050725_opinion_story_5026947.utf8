 THROUGH THE SHINING GLASS, DARKLY

 MIND THE GAP

 Is Gurgaon an urban monstrosity, as some believe it is?

 On a recent visit to Delhi, a family friend who is a resident there insisted that he take us to Gurgaon. He termed it an ?urban monstrosity?, and a perfect example of how a city should not be planned. Having often heard of Gurgaon in Calcutta and being faintly aware of the divergent opinions about its development, I was curious to see the place. So I quickly acquiesced.

 There are two views about Gurgaon. One was expressed by our friend who, I believe, is in the minority. The prevailing view among the middle and upper classes is that Gurgaon is a proud symbol of India?s staggering economic growth. 

 Just before sunset, we drove into Gurgaon and circled around it for a couple of hours. It is truly a strange sight. The roads are wide but there are no footpaths. On either side of the roads are wastelands on which gargantuan modern structures have been erected ? the ubiquitous malls which occur with such frequency that I am sure there are more malls than there are people in Gurgaon. Some of the malls are still under construction, one of them the world?s largest mall, as a well-travelled friend in Calcutta informed. But these were not the only buildings being built on the plains of Haryana. Equally large residential buildings have come up, most of them yet to be occupied. 

 As it grew dark, tiny lighted rectangles became visible far away in some of these homes. Taking in this sight with the great size of the surrounding constructions, their modern ?architecture? and the barren land in the background, it seemed to me that an alien race had descended on earth and had taken little time in starting to build their colony.

 The most disturbing fact about Gurgaon was the lack of infrastructure. The roads were choked by masses of cars. Between the malls or residential compounds, there are no paved roads or ways for pedestrians to walk in relative comfort. Interspersed between these very modern structures are very unmodern patches of wasteland. Apart from the occasional cycle-rickshaw, public transport is absent. I saw only one bus during the trip there. Our friend informed us that the fire brigade was slow to respond to reports of fire. Thus, the safety measures were also quite inadequate.

 What then does one make of Gurgaon? I had read an article by Dipankar Dasgupta in these pages in which he said that India had missed Stage II in economic development. According to conventional economic theory, the first stage of economic development involves the growth of the agricultural sector, which accounts for the largest share of the gross domestic product. This stage is followed by the growth of the industrial sector and, finally, the predominant growth of the services sector ? the last stage which signals complete economic development.

 But India is an anomaly. In 2002, the services sector made up the highest share of the Indian GDP, just like the GDP of any developed country. But the difference is that, unlike developed nations, there has been insufficient development of India?s industrial sector. Which means India has skipped the second stage of economic development. In contrast, China is in the second stage, its industrial sector having the maximum share of the GDP. Although the Chinese services sector has a smaller share in GDP than in India, its total output is more than that of the Indian. This is because services develop best around ?concentrated industrial centres?.

 Gurgaon, with its unbalanced appearance, seems to symbolize this uncertain growth of India?s services sector, devoid of a strong industrial base. Apart from a few factories, there is hardly any manufacturing units. The lack of industry has held back the development of adequate infrastructure. In Gurgaon, some of the massive retail outlets, or malls, are closing down before others are opened because of the lack of customers. Somehow this seems to represent the strange turn in India?s economic fortunes.

 Thus Gurgaon is a symbol of India?s economic growth. It is also an urban monstrosity.

 FAR FROM THE MADDING MEDIA

 Malvika Singh

 If you are away from a metropolis for a length of time, you realize, to your surprise, that your life is purer and more uncluttered if there is no English-language newspaper or an excess of news channels to overwhelm you. Being away shows that there is energy of a different kind out there in the many towns of India. A tiny bit of travel into the hinterland shows you that the mainstream English-language media in India are completely divorced from what is happening in the country. They are superficial in their reflection of the reality. They are lazy and only report what is at their doorstep or fed to them by those who hang about near their doorstep. They do no homework and their reports only use information handed out by various factions and vested interest groups indulging in public mud-slinging. The public has begun to mock these media, and young people in India just do not take the press and its reports seriously. 

 Blame game

 The recent attack in the press on the minister of tourism is a case in point. Reading the reports, one cannot comprehend the crux of the story. It is as if some disgruntled babus have been caught with their hands in the till and have discovered that, before they are exposed for having fiddled with the system, they must leak misinformation to cover their misdemeanours. The classic blame game ? blame the minister and absolve yourself. 

 And no one has questioned the story, nor has any reporter queried the ?accusations?. The press has blindly printed what appears to be a hand-out because every story has been the same. Editorial stances seem to be partisan and newspapers are being identified with particular political positions, throwing to the winds the erstwhile values and ethics of this fourth estate in democracy. Journalism of this kind is embarrassing for some in the fraternity.

 The babu continues to get away with manipulation, whether in the ministry he operates or with the press. The politician, far more connected with the realities on the ground, has to carry the can and the outcome of the manipulating babu. Many politicians abdicate their power and allow themselves to become putty in the hands of their bureaucrats, because more often than not they are unfamiliar with the terrain of their allotted ministry. Why burn the midnight oil, why fight it out, when it is easier to give in? That is the tragedy of governance. 

 Exit, the babu

 Commenting on this rather sad plight of the government, an erudite observer stressed the fact that today, after many years, India has not one but at least half a dozen ?clean? leaders at the helm who can bring about a radical change in the system. The prime minister must begin to clean out the muck and save this country from a scary future. He has the support of people and constituents, across the parties. That fact alone makes him, potentially, an extremely strong prime minister, one who commands much respect. He must pull rank.

 The mindset of the ?traditional? babu has to be drowned. The hold of the babu on the politician has to be totally diluted. All babus have to be made wholly accountable. They are becoming a mafia, one that the citizen shuns and abhors. It is time to make the corrective. It is time for the government to become a facilitator. Administrative suffocation has held back this entrepreneurial society by the sheer force of the powers that the babu is endowed with. 

 Colonial powers were transferred from the burra sahib to the brown sahib. That attitude has to change. It is time for the government to let go and allow unhindered creative growth. With the babu out of the way, India will jump-start and race ahead.

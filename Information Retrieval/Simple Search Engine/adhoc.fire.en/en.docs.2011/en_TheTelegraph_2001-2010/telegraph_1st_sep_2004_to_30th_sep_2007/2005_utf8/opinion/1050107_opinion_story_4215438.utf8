 HELL ON EARTH

 Looking back

Gulag: A history of the soviet camps 

By Anne Applebaum, 

Allen Lane, pound; 20 

The word Gulag is an acronym of Glavnoe upravlenie 

lagerei which means Main Camp Administration. But it has come to mean something 

much more. It refers to the system of concentration camps and also to the slave 

labour that the Soviet Union used. The Gulag was scattered across the Soviet Union 

and the camps could vary in nature: labour camps, punishment camps, criminal and 

political camps, women?s camps, children?s camps, transit camps and so on. Gulag, 

as Anne Applebaum points out in this exhaustively researched book, has come to 

represent the Soviet repressive system. The book can only bring to mind the cry, 

?the horror, the horror of it.? Today, the full details of Hitler?s Final Solution 

have become clear thanks to the work done by historians. The cruelties of the 

Soviet regime, as horrible and as cold-blooded as the Nazi atrocities, are just 

coming to light. Applebaum deserves to be congratulated for this exposition and 

analysis.

 The Gulag had its antecedents in Tsarist Russia but it acquired a sophisticated form under the Bolsheviks. In the summer of 1918, Lenin decided to put away ?unreliable elements? in concentration camps. By 1921, 84 such camps had sprung up and these were spread over 43 provinces. From 1929, the camps took on new proportions and significance. Stalin decided that forced labour would be used to drive Soviet industrialization. Simultaneously, the penal system began to come under the control of the Soviet secret police. Through the Thirties, the period of Stalin?s great terror, the camps expanded and by the end of that decade camps were to be found in every part of the Soviet Union?s 12 time zones.

 The figures for individuals who passed through the Gulag are mind-boggling. According to Applebaum, some 18 million people passed through this massive system and at any given point in time the total number of prisoners in the camps was around two million.

 This reconstruction of the Gulag has been possible because of the dismantling of the entire Soviet system. From the end of the Eighties when Gorbachev?s project was evident, a flood of documents about the Gulag became available. Memoirs of inmates and survivors, confined to the underground, came to be published. Historians began to work on the numbers involved, the character of the repression and so on. This work still continues. Applebaum brings together all these various threads to produce a monumental and a poignant account of one of the most repressive systems created by human beings to oppress and murder other human beings. All in the name of Communism.

 Support to Nazism has damaged the reputation of many persons in Europe and elsewhere. But supporters of the Soviet system who either justified or deliberately chose to turn a blind eye to the Gulag walk around in academia and in other arenas of public life. They should read this book and hang their heads in shame.

 ?Human kind cannot bear too much reality?, T.S. Eliot wrote. Applebaum?s book always brings to mind that line.

 HEALTHY AND GROWING

 Dipankar Das

 Earlier in February, the Indian software service industry heaved a collective sigh of relief as McKinsey Inc. laid to rest one of their deepest fears. The company?s report on China?s IT service industry shows definitively that China will take many years to grow to the size and level of expertise of India?s software services. The revenue of this industry is rising quickly, but it is still about half of India?s $ 12.7 billion-a-year. 

 Chinese software growth too is driven by domestic, middle- to small-size players. Only 10 per cent of the revenue is from exports. China?s famed advantage of low-cost-labour is also not of much help since the advantage gets balanced off by the low operating margins in the industry owing to the low value chain work it does.

 The Chinese industry is also deeply fragmented. The top ten Chinese players command only 20 per cent of the revenues, while in India the figure is 45 per cent. China has almost 8,000 software companies, a third of which have less than 50 employees, while only 5 have more than 2,000 employees. Compare this with India, where there are about 3,000 software companies and more than 15 of them have more than 2,000 employees. Fragmentation also results in weak process and quality controls. Only five of China?s top 30 companies are certified at level 4 or 5 of the Capability Maturity Model scale.

 Size does matter

 Structurally, the Indian environment offers some advantages. A developed money market makes capital easily available for high performing Indian companies. A mature financial market also results in a fluid M amp;A culture, allowing companies to grow quickly through acquisitions. Chinese companies, on the other hand, concentrate more on organic growth.

 However, despite the advantages, even a hint of complacency could kill the industry in India. A large number of factors help the Indian companies ? the low entry barriers to the software service market, the absence of patented products or processes that keep the rivals at bay and so on. But though 75 per cent of its software services is exported, in overall terms, India still has a minuscule percentage of the global software services exports. India also has to contend with global giants like IBM, EDS, Accenture and so on, who, with their armed with software development centres across Asia, are hitting out at India?s price competitiveness.

 Catch me if you can

 One hurdle India poses to its competitors in the IT and the BPO sectors is the easy availability of English-speaking graduates. But China is quickly catching up on this count. Since 2000, the number of English- speaking graduates in the Chinese job market has doubled. But the greatest advantage China has over India is the sheer strength of the Chinese economy. With an annual trade surplus of $ 5 billion and an annual foreign direct investment of more than $ 50 billion, China has been guzzling goods and services from the world over. An economy of this size has the potential of supporting substantial domestic growth.

 China?s biggest advantage over India is its huge hardware industry. Practically all leading American hardware companies have their manufacturing back-offices in China. The country?s hardware might have been further strengthened by the global recognition it received after Legend Computers, a Chinese company, bought out IBM?s PC manufacturing division. Greater integration between hardware and software industries in China can immediately catapult the software industry a few notches higher. 

 While the Indian software industry can rejoice its superiority, it needs to remember that it has to consolidate its gains and grab an ever-larger chunk of the global software market.

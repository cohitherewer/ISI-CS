 TO BE OR NOT 

 Power is to be exercised; sharing power stops the exercise. Ms Sonia Gandhi, the president of the Congress, must be ruing the agreement she entered into three years ago to share power with the People?s Democratic Party in Kashmir. By the terms of the agreement, the tenure of the present chief minister, Mr Mufti Mohammed Sayeed, is coming to an end, and it should be the turn of a Congress chief minister to hold the reins of office. But time is perhaps not exactly right for a change of horses in Kashmir. For one thing, Mr Sayeed has earned for himself an amount of goodwill: the people of Kashmir, long suffering and long suspicious of the intentions of New Delhi, have accepted the government of Mr Sayeed as a government which is of the people of Kashmir, for the people of Kashmir and by the people of Kashmir. This perception might change for the worse with the swearing in of a Congress chief minister. The Congress is not perceived as a party that is committed to upholding the interests of the people of Kashmir. All these factors and the presence of Pakistan, ever-willing to take advantage of political uncertainty in Kashmir, has made Ms Gandhi reluctant to claim for her party a chief ministership which belongs to the Congress according to a partnership agreement.

 The choice before Ms Gandhi is unenviable. There are good reasons for continuing with Mr Sayeed, as the previous paragraph suggests. But there are contrary arguments as well. If Mr Sayeed continues as chief minister, the agreement becomes irrelevant. If Mr Sayeed is allowed to continue only for a few more months, his position and authority could become untenable, a situation which he has refused to accept. Since there are only 24 months left for the next round of elections, if a Congress government takes over after a few months, it will have to bear the burden of the incumbency factor. Moreover, allowing Mr Sayeed to continue might convey the impression that the Congress in Kashmir lacks in self-confidence. The circumstances point to the impracticality of the original agreement. Because of it, Mr Sayeed is now left in limbo and the Congress in the throes of indecision. There is only one person whose decision can resolve the issue. But she, characteristically, has not let her mind be known. The top is a lonely place, as Ms Gandhi well knows. Sometimes, there is not even the inner voice for company.

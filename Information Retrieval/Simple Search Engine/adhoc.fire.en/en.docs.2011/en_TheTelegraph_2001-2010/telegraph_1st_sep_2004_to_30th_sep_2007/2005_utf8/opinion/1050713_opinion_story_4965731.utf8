 HOW THE GAME WAS LOST

 Amulya GangulI

 In the immediate aftermath of the Babri Masjid demolition, a saffron journalist had written that ?we are all kar sevaks now?. Thirteen years later, the earlier fizz has clearly disappeared, so much so that the chief kar sevak of that period, L.K. Advani, seemed strangely subdued even though the makeshift temple at Ayo-dhya had been attacked by terrorists. 

 What has gone wrong with the Ram Janmabhoomi movement which Advani once compared with the independence struggle ? For a start, it was a simulated agitation which had been conjured out of the thin air by a party desperately looking for ways to make its presence felt. As such, it lacked a substantial base of public support to sustain it for any length of time. That it was given a sudden artificial boost is evident from the fact that the issue did not figure in any of the Jan Sangh?s programmes right from the party?s birth in the Fifties through 1985, when it was first raised, not by the BJP, but by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad.

 The year of the ?discovery? of the issue is significant. Only a year ago, the BJP had hit political nadir when it won just two seats in the Lok Sabha. At the party?s conclave in Calcutta in 1985, quite out of the blue, the focus was turned on the Babri Masjid as an ?ocular provocation? (Advani?s description) which had to be demolished as it was built by the invading Mughals, supposedly after destroying a temple on the site of Ram?s ?birthplace?.

 It was a godsend for the BJP, and the mixture of nationalism and religion proved heady enough to take the party to previously unscaled heights in national politics. However, the BJP could not have imagined that the temple issue would fizzle out after a decade, leaving the party in an even worse state than in 1984. 

 Mistake, mistake

 There were reasons for its miscalculation. As a party of orthodox, upper-caste, north Indian Hindus, it had little understanding of the pluralistic undercurrents of Indian society, failing to see that a small percentage of the overall Hindu population was actively anti-Muslim. Its other mistake was to identify the overt religiosity of north India?s Hindus with communalism, since a person routinely visiting a temple does not automatically want to destroy a mosque. But perhaps the most serious mistake was to believe that the Congress was in terminal decline.

 The BJP now had no more cards to play. It may have also occurred to it that by adopting such virulent policies, which alienated the minorities as well as the liberals, it may have factored in the Congress?s revival.

 The Congress?s resuscitation was not the BJP?s only problem. Its successful peace overtures to Pakistan had also added to its woes. If Pakistan became friendly, a major plank of the BJP?s anti-Muslim world-view would be demolished. 

 Ruling at the Centre proved to be worse from the point of view of its militant politics. Not only did it compel the party to tone down its own Hindutva agenda, it widened its mental horizon from the lower middle class mofussil localities of north India to take in the whole country with its incredible diversity. The kar sevaks had seen the city lights. In addition, the BJP may have realized that what appealed to its conservative supporters ? a ban on cow slaughter and on religious conversions ? didn?t appeal to everyone else. But the problem was that the RSS did not realize these limitations of office. It still believes that since India is 85 per cent Hindu, a Hindu rashtra is its natural mode of governance.

 But they have read India wrong. The people of India are neither all kar sevaks, nor are they proletarian revolutionaries. In fact, what they shun the most is extremism and intolerance. It is this innate good sense of the ordinary people which has rung the death knell for the BJP?s brand of violent sectarianism.

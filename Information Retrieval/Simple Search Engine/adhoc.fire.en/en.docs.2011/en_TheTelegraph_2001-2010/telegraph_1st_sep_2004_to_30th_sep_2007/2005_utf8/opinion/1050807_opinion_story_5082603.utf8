 CHIEF CONCERN

 Stick to the knitting is a slogan that has been made memorable by the famous management guru, Mr C.K. Prahlad. The substance of the slogan is that business houses should nurture what in the jargon is known as their core competence. What is true for business corporations is a fortiori true for individuals. Mr Manmohan Singh is a trained economist who has been an economic mandarin par excellence. There is nothing in his curriculum vitae to suggest that he is an authority on tigers or on the environment. Yet Mr Singh has got himself involved with the fate of the Indian tiger. There were reports a few weeks ago that the prime minister would chair a committee that would organize the 150th anniversary of the 1857 uprising. The fate of tigers and history should be left in the hands of experts in the respective fields. Mr Singh, with all his erudition, is not an expert in these fields. His involvement in such matters means that his attention is being diverted from more important issues which need his expert knowledge and guidance. Mr Singh is a great advocate of out-of-the-box ideas. He should take the first step and announce that as prime minister he will not chair committees which are outside his core competence, not even for ceremonial purposes. Affairs of state and the economy will then get his best and undivided attention.

 At a different level, the same syndrome also afflicts the new mayor of Calcutta, Mr Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya. He has announced that he will continue his legal practice even though he is the mayor. Mr Bhattacharya might consider his legal skills to be his core competence but then he should not have strayed from the courts of law into the municipal corporation. He has been elected to the post of mayor and this should now be his full-time occupation. Mr Bhattacharya has chosen to be in public life and to hold public office. He cannot now, in good conscience, continue his legal practice, which is his profession as a private individual. There was a time when someone like B.C. Roy could be both a doctor and the chief minister, but now the demands and responsibilities of public office have changed. Calcutta can no longer afford to have a mayor whose attention is divided.

 In the case of Mr Singh and in the case of Mr Bhattacharya, it is a question of priorities. The decline in the number of tigers in India is important, but does it need Mr Singh?s direct involvement? The answer is no. But the prime minister?s knowledge and experience are vital when issues like economic growth, foreign policy and so on are deliberated and decided. On tigers, the prime minister will be well advised to take the experts? opinion. Mr Bhattacharya?s practice might be important to him but it has to take second place in the light of the official position he holds. Public life in India would be enriched if people stuck to their appointed jobs and to their expertise.

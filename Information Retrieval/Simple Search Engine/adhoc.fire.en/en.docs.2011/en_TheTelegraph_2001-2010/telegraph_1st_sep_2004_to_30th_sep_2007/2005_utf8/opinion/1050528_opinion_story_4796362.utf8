 GO ON

 Hes cool. He backchats celebs with flair. And he gets everyone to let their hair down. TV viewers can hardly wait to share their next coffee with Karan Johar

 CHATTERATI

 Other 

 Mumbai mikers:

 Priya 

 Tendulkar: Hosted a hard-hitting semi-political 

 chat-show

 a mark as the anchor of a satire

 bahu voiced her opinions on social issues

 Simi Garewal: Spoke 

 in hushed whispers with celebs.

 Lets say this for television ? the medium reinvents. Till the autumn of last year, Karan Johar was this young man who made films. On Friday, when he took a well-deserved breather after successfully anchoring a television chat show for the last six months, Johar made his mark as a man who controls the remote buttons as well.

 Some are born TV anchors, some become TV anchors and some have TV anchorship thrust upon them. Karan Johar belongs to the first category. He is a born anchor because he has all the inherent traits of one. And he is a born anchor because of the family he was born in. What can you say about a chat show host who refers to the first couple of Hindi cinema as Amit Uncle and Jaya Aunty?

 For the time-being, though, the uncles and aunts have been put on hold as Johar ? the son of the late film producer, Yash Johar ? takes a sabbatical from Koffee with Karan, a popular Star World programme. He is slated to be back next year, but right now he says he is going to focus on his new film, Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna.

 The Grand Finale of Friday ended with a bang, as Karan Johars last show of the season featured a relaxed Amitabh Bachchan, a hyper-active Shah Rukh Khan, and a host of others. The coffee hamper included a gift from Louis Vuitton and perfume.

 Johar will be missed by those for whom he has been a weekly fix. One lot was addicted to him because he gave a close-up of a world that few had access to. And another lot liked him because they thought he was one of them.

 And those are the two worlds of the 32-year-old writer-director-producer. Johar, clearly, is a natural when it comes to conducting chat shows with the creamy layer of Hindi filmdom for its a layer that envelops him as well. Who, after all, can ask Abhishek Bachchan why he was giggling at a party? Or who can snigger out aloud when Preity Zinta talks about her close friendship with other women actresses?

 But, on the other hand, Johar, who made his directorial debut with the hit, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai in 1999, is in many ways the image of the pan-Indian urban youth as well. He looks like the boy next door, dresses casually, is cool and speaks the informal English that is the lingua franca of Generation X.

 And that, says a media critic, is his USP. Johar reaches out to the audience because he makes the glamour garden look like a kitchen garden. Hema Malini talks about her affair with Dharmendra, Sushmita Sen about how she won the Miss India crown, defeating Aishwarya Rai, and Nitu Singh about husband Rishis fondness for alcohol.

 He is a part of this world, so he can intrude where others cannot, says a media-watcher. And, at the same time, he gives space to the aspirational values of the viewer, the columnist says.

 The show, Star holds, was Johars idea. And Johar says in an interview: The show is more like an extra-curricular activity or hobby for me. I talk to so many personalities on a daily basis, so I thought, hey, why not get paid for it?

 The old student of Greenlawns School and HR College in Mumbai, whose latest film, Kaal, has just been released, told The Telegraph soon after the show went on the air that the first days shoot had turned him into a nervous wreck, as he sat down to interview old pals Saif Ali Khan and Preity Zinta. When I faced the camera, I began to understand what a difficult job acting is. By the end I was totally stressed out.

 Thats the Johar magic ? his I-am-one-of-you, spare-me-guys attitude. He is what Simi Garewal ? another popular TV show host ? was not. She looked sympathetic, spoke in whispers and didnt get into areas considered out-of-bounds. Johar is frank, often rude, and loves to probe subjects that celebrities seldom speak of: spats within the industry, love affairs and scandals. The whole concept of Koffee with Karan is about high glamour and to bring out the best in the Bollywood film fraternity, he says in a recent interview. Its probably interesting to see a filmmaker do this because I dont think it has happened anywhere else in the world.

 The filmmaker, indeed, is leaving the directorial chair behind for other experiences. These days, Johar ? known for his ready wit ? is a popular compere at glitzy film awards as well. And the man who goes to tarot card-reader Sunita Menon with small queries stresses that he is good at all this because he is a peoples person.

 For a man who had stayed out of the Bollywood limelight as an industry son, Koffee with Karan also threw some light on the director himself. Now, thanks to his own chatty style, you know that he swears by the letter K, is superstitious, a Gemini and has a fear of flying. And who says he gets irked when he is called a candyfloss filmmaker.

 Quite possibly, it was this that pulled Johar out of the TV studio, and back to the outdoors of feature-film locales. Johar said somewhere that he decided it was time he went back to cinema when an enthusiastic father urged him to host a chat-show for children. Call it Toffee with Karan, he suggested.

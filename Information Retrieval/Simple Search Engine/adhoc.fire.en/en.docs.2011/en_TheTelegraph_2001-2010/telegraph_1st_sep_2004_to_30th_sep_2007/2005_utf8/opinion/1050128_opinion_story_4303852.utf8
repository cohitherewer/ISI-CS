 ROUTINE PLEDGE

 Election manifestos in India read like fairy tales. Since competitive populism is the name of the game, the parties try to outdo each other in promising the moon. The manifestos of the major contenders for the assembly polls in Jharkhand live up to this dubious tradition. The Congress and its ally, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, have promised rice and wheat at Rs 2 per kilogram for the people living below the poverty line. It obviously is in response to the Bharatiya Janata Party?s promise to provide rice at Rs 3 to the poorest of the state?s people. The BJP, which has ruled the state for the past five years, also promises to provide electricity and drinking water to each village over the next five years. The parties also pledge unemployment allowances, old-age pensions and other benefits for different sections of the people. It is rather futile to even discuss the merit of most of the pledges because they are routinely made during election campaigns and forgotten thereafter. Even the parties which make the promises know how impractical most of these are. The finances of most states are in such a mess that they cannot hope to raise the money required to implement most of the populist schemes. If the politicians still promise so much, it only speaks of their cynical faith in their ability to fool the people. 

 Yet, the vast majority of the people in Jharkhand live in dire straits. It is among the poorest states in the country and recent statistics suggest that the per capita availability of grain for the people there is much lower than the national average. Ironically, the lack of food and other basic necessities is most pervasive among the tribals and other backward people. The promises made by the BJP is, therefore, laced with a cruel irony. The party?s five-year rule did little to improve the conditions of the poor, be it in food security, health or basic education. Worse, some of its policies sought to divide the poor people on ethnic, religious or caste lines. Its failure to involve the people in development through the panchayati raj institutions has been particularly disappointing. The state faces grim consequences of such failures. The Maoist rebels have taken advantage of the government?s failures to lure large sections of the poor into their ranks. The longer Jharkhand continues to wallow in its present level of poverty, the stiffer the Maoist challenge will become. It is time the state?s politicians realized this.

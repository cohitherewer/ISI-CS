 DIARY

 It is probably time to give awards to parliamentarians simply for attendance, but the category will have to wait as long as there remains the enthusiasm to spot ?best parliamentarians?. Till now, a handful can still be found each year, and they seem to be evenly spread among the opposition and treasury benches. At least that is what it seems, given the selection committee?s decision to award two leaders each from the Congress and the BJP this year ? Manmohan Singh and Arjun Singh from the former and LK Advani and Jaswant Singh from the latter. While there was hardly any doubt among the members themselves about the talent of Advani as a legislator, there was much circumspection about the Singhs. True, the doctor took less time to make his diagnosis known than the former poet in his chair, but he seemed to lack both humour and wit. And the Singh in HRD was too busy with toxicity levels elsewhere than be bothered about what he was doing to the house. That Advani himself had doubts about the justness of being equated with the duo was evident in his acceptance speech, where he said that the way members were being selected for the honour, it seemed that eventually the award would be given to ?every MP who reaches a certain age?. Touch?!

 A slight change of order by order. If that makes no sense, here?s an explanation. Some time last month, Mulayam Singh Yadav arrived at the Delhi airport with his special secretary, the former DM of Sultanpur and Barabanki. Two of his nephews (newly elected MP, Dharmendra Yadav, being one), who were at the airport with their wives to catch a flight to Ahmedabad, rushed to meet Uncle Yadav. The family touched netaji?s feet. Netaji immediately asked them to do the same to his secretary. Taken aback at first, the family nevertheless complied. Politico paying obeisance to bureaucrat in full public glare? Completely against the order!

 Crammed in by a horde of economists ? Manmohan, Montek Singh and others ? P Chidambaram seems desperate to prove that he still matters, even after the budget. Accosted by an editor of a fortnightly who wanted to see him whenever he was ?free?, PC shot back, ?Oh! I will not be free till May 23, 2009?. That was the end of the five-year term of the present Lok Sabha. 

 Former prime minister of Pakistan, Shujaat Hussain, loves India. Within his country, he continues to be a presence on account of his proximity to the General, and Hussain?s brother being the chief minister of Punjab. The situation seems to have got Hussain thinking. He has apparently enquired with his powerful Indian friends about the role Sonia Gandhi plays in the government, and the perks and paraphernalia that accrue to her in return. The point he could probably be working on to impress on his own government is that if Sonia is given such facilities for the part she plays, why cannot he get them too? We agree, why not? But has anyone informed him about the tyaga bit? 

 Rahul Gandhi may have a thing or two to learn from Mukul Wasnik, the AICC gen-sec in charge of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat, or the situation he is in. Wasnik?s problem is not the work itself, but the attitude of the leaders in these states who think he is too young to be taken seriously. In MP, he has to deal with people like Arjun Singh and Digvijay Singh, in Gujarat Sonia?s powerful political secretary, Ahmad Patel, and in Rajasthan, seniors like Ashok Gehlot, Girija Vyas and Natwar Singh. But then, he is no Nehru-Gandhi to make people eat out of his hands. Unlike Rahul.

 A virtual stalemate at India International Centre, the capital?s famous watering hole for superannuated diplomats. In the recent election for the IIC?s managing body, the contest for the lone post of a trustee has resulted in a tie between the former Union cabinet secretary, Naresh Chandra, and the former chief justice of Himachal Pradesh, Leila Seth. The IIC constitution empowers its president to decide the issue with a casting vote. But that seems to be too much of a task for eminent jurist, Soli Sorabjee, who, more than 10 days after the counting, is yet to settle the issue. Sorabjee?s disinterest with other things like admission of members is also alleged to have allowed the entry of many unwanted elements into the institution. Time to wake up time, Soli!

 The age of Madhya Pradesh?s politicians seems to be dropping at an alarming rate. That alone explains why even the CM can feel free to behave in the most juvenile fashion. At Sanchi, after an official function, Babulal Gaur found his pro-Uma Bharti cabinet colleague and arch rival, Gauri Shankar Shejwar, getting into his car. Gaur lost control and, in full public view, asked Shejwar to get out of the vehicle. ?You do not deserve to sit with me?, hissed Gaur. A livid Shejwar wanted to resign immediately, but was restrained by the sadhvi, who has apparently asked him to hold on for a little longer. As for an explanation of Gaur?s reaction, we have an account of his pre-CM days. Residents of the 74-Bungalow area, where the two lived, were apparently witness to several fights between the two, even the alleged attack on Gaur by Shejwar?s bull-terrier each time the former tried to get out of his house. The dog, Gaur was convinced, had been trained by Shejwar himself.

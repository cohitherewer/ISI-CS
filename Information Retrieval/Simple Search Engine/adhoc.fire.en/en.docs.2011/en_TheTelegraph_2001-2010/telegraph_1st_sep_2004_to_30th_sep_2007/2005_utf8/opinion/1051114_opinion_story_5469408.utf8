 SILVER LINING

 The opening of crossing points along the line of control between India and Pakistan has been widely welcomed. These points will be used for helping victims of the recent earthquake. The opening of these points will, however, have wider political implications which may not be obvious right away. The first relief point was opened at Chakan-da-Bagh in Poonch. Subsequently, the Aman Setu in Uri and Teethwal in Tangdhar have been opened up. Over the next week, two more crossing points, in Mendhar and in Uri, will be opened. Most of the points will be initially used to ferry relief material across the LoC to victims of the earthquake, which killed thousands of people and rendered many more homeless. The worst damage has been caused in Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir, especially the areas closest to the epicentre near Muzaffarabad. Most of the relief will thus move from the Indian side of the LoC to PoK. Indeed, it is believed that there are several villages in PoK which have still received no aid. Easier access from the Indian side of the LoC should help matters. Both India and Pakistan have shown considerable diplomatic flexibility and political maturity in allowing this unprecedented softening of the LoC. Whether this is the beginning of a process by which the LoC will become a real soft line of demarcation remains to be seen. India and Pakistan have already committed themselves to allowing divided families from both sides move across the LoC in the near future. This will apparently happen with the minimal of bureaucratic procedures. It has also been signalled that civilians and non-governmental organizations could be allowed to move freely to aid in the relief effort. If all goes well, a gradual reduction of the military forces on either side could also take place. This would be a huge confidence-building measure and go a great way in defusing tensions between India and Pakistan. 

 There is reason, however, to be cautious. There are signs of an escalation of violence in the state, and the danger is that militant groups could take advantage of a soft LoC to infiltrate into Jammu and Kashmir. And precisely because elements in Pakistan feel that a softening could lead to material change in the conflict over Kashmir, Islamabad could be forced to close the points once the relief efforts are over. In any case, New Delhi must continue to support the process of opening up while ensuring that the security guard is not lowered.

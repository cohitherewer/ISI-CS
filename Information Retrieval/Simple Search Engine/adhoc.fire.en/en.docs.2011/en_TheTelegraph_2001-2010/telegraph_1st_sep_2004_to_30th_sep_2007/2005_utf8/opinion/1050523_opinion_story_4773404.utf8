 OUR MAN IN THE DRESSING ROOM

 SHOT IN THE DARK

 Mothers of young cricketers debate over the selection of the new Indian cricket coach at Vivekananda Park

 Who will serve them best?

 While the national cricketers went into a break after their gruelling season, the grind began for the BCCI and certain important names in Indian cricket. The issue of the selection of the new Indian cricket coach occupied the collective Indian imagination through the last few weeks, thanks to the written and spoken word ? the ?expert comments? ? in our newspapers and news channels. The selection of a coach, which became something of a national responsibility, has finally been done by the wise men of Indian cricket. 

 The spirit of high drama was sustained during the lengthy selection process. The final shortlist was disclosed only after putting a billion-strong nation through nerve-wracking suspense. Would there be only foreigners on the list? Would X?s choice get priority over Y?s? And the speculations went on. 

 And then came the intrigue of the interview. Who would make the best ?presentation?? Would a tech-savvy interviewee get more marks, meaning that he can handle temperamental Indian cricketers as well as being able to handle his laptop? And, of course, would those who took the interview before and after the BCCI bosses went off to meet the prime minister be assessed differently?

 Yes, all this did make one wish that urban Indians would show this level of engagement when it came to electing their representatives to parliament. But such wishful thoughts apart, there was a rather unlikely group of people who were extremely opinionated about the selection of the cricket coach. This group comprises primarily the mothers of our future Tendulkars and Souravs. 

 Gathered under the shady trees of Vivekananda Park, as their wards practise to perfect their forward defence, they animatedly discuss the pros and cons of selecting a ?phoren coach?. ?A foreign coach will not be biased towards players from certain regions?, quips one. ?He will back any player who shows potential. Haven?t you seen what happened to Sourav in 1992 under an Indian coach?? These are women who have not been able to erase the memories of unfair treatment meted out to Bengal cricketers. Their solution ? a foreign coach. 

 The older ones among the group are all for Chappell. The confident and elegant batsman is an important figure in their childhood memories. So what if he has played his last competitive match almost twenty-five years ago? ?Only he can help Sourav get over his bad patch,? they say, reminding their younger companions of the Indian skipper?s 144 at Gabba, after his session with Chappell. One tends to think that the wide acceptance of, even demand for, Chappell has actually been fuelled by Sourav Ganguly?s dismal form, since it is believed that Ganguly shares a rapport with Chappell which he doesn?t share with anyone else. 

 A few ? with the traditional Bengali weakness for Brazil in football and West Indies in cricket ? rooted for Desmond Haynes, the real dark horse in the race. After all, who but this great partner to Gordon Greenidge can cure the nagging Indian opening problem in test cricket? 

 But the last word must be pronounced. And someone does pronounce it ? ?There would be no need for all this confusion if Steve Waugh accepted the responsibility to build the Indian team for the future. That would certainly be a far more worthwhile project than building a ? rather perplexing concept ? ?cricket city?. But he must still be smarting from being kept waiting at the toss by an insolent Ganguly.? It would not be entirely pleasant, the mothers agree, for Waugh and Ganguly to share the dressing room. 

 The boys are through with their session, and the mothers retire, happy that the second best, if not the best, man is in charge.

 BORDER TROUBLE

 What happens on the borders may well be at the centre of relations between countries. The current state of India-Pakistan ties is reflected in the ceasefire along the line of control in Jammu and Kashmir, and more recently, in the opening of the bus service between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad. The brutal killing of a Border Security Force jawan by the men of the Bangladesh Rifles in Tripura is, on the other hand, a measure of the souring relations between New Delhi and Dhaka. That the tragedy occurred while senior officials of the BSF and the BDR were meeting in Dhaka makes it even more ominous. The most disturbing thing is the fact that tensions on the India-Bangladesh borders have become quite frequent. Despite several rounds of talks in Dhaka and New Delhi, not much seems to have changed since the worst outrage four years ago at Mankachar in Assam, in which 16 jawans of the BSF were killed by the BDR. The skirmishes have made large stretches of the borders unsafe for the local people on both sides. Worse, the BDR seems to have a sinister strategy ? it uses common people living on the border villages inside Bangladesh in waylaying and attacking BSF men. 

 Only superficially, the tensions are related to India?s decision to erect barbed-wire fencing along its borders with Bangladesh. It is not easy to put up such fencing without controversies. The borders often run through agricultural land, markets, places of worship and even homes, thanks to historical reasons that resulted in an arbitrary demarcation of the boundaries. Even Indian villagers are inconvenienced by the fencing that sometimes takes away slices of their land. But the real dispute has its genesis in the differing perceptions of the two countries on the need for the fencing. Dhaka sees it as a hostile act, almost infringing on its sovereignty. For New Delhi, the fencing, on the borders with both Bangladesh and Pakistan, reflects an important security concern. Indian anxieties have worsened because of the rise of Islamic fundamentalist groups in Bangladesh. Also, Dhaka?s persistent refusal to entertain India?s complaints on the shelters and training camps of north-eastern militants inside that country has not helped matters. Attitudes have, therefore, hardened on both sides. It is time practical strategies replaced rhetoric in both countries.

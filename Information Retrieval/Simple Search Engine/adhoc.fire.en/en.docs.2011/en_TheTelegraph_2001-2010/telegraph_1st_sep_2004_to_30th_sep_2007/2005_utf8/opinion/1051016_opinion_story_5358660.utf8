 A NEVER-ENDING BOND

 ?The name is Bond, James Bond.?? These words, made famous by Ian Fleming, have been uttered by actors on screen, and by none more memorably than Sean Connery. They will now be said by Daniel Craig, the actor who is to play the spy in a new version of Casino Royale, the book in which Fleming introduced Bond to his readers. Bond has become the stuff of legends. Every man?s dream, and every woman?s too, though, of course, in different ways. Bond is ruggedly handsome. He drives fast cars. He wears light blue or white shirts from Turnbull and Asser. He smokes custom-made cigarettes; makes the perfect martini, ?shaken not stirred?. His golf is good, shooting excellent and he is cold and calculating at the card and the gambling table. Women find him irresistible. He is what every man secretly wants to be, and every woman wants to bed. He has a license to kill and thus his right hand is always free: women are on his left side in bed. Among all fictional characters, Bond has iconic status.

 Bond is not easy to depict in reel life. An actor who plays Bond, enacts not only the character but the icon as well. Sean Connery?s depiction of the agent 007 contributed in no little way to the making of the icon. He then had to suffer what he had helped to create. James Bond did not leave Sean Connery even when Sean Connery had ceased to play James Bond. A worse fate befell Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan. They not only had to play Bond, character and icon, they also had to endure being measured against the standards set by Connery. If Bond on the printed page was ageless and ever youthful, then on the screen there was only one Bond, forever, like diamonds. Obviously, this was not fair on the actors. But nothing is ever quite fair in Bond novels. Whatever the odds, Bond invariably wins and gets the gal.

 The charm of James Bond is the lure of the never-never. The author, an old Etonian who wanted to join the Foreign Office but made it only to the Reuters News Agency, finally had his dreams fulfilled during World War II when he became personal assistant to the director of naval intelligence. Bond was a kind of wish fulfilment for the author and for Britons who found it difficult to accept Britain?s declining influence in world affairs, especially after the Suez crisis of 1956. The post-war angst of Britons, however, does not explain the phenomenal success of the Bond novels and films. Fleming with his heady cocktail of the secret world and the high life touched an obscure corner in the hearts of men. Like James Thurber?s Walter Mitty, Bond, despite all his obvious unreality, helped men to escape into an elusive dream world.

 The new Bond on the screen has a legacy as his challenge. But Bond?s success can never be shaken, it can only be stirred.

 Paperback Pickings

 History, laughter and tears

 Voices 

 in the city (Orient, Rs 175) by Anita Desai 

 is yet another book from one of India?s most prolific 

 writers in English. Novels, short stories, children?s books, 

 Desai has written them all and yet she continuous to impress 

 with her rich visual imagery and lucid style of story-telling. 

 In Voices in the city, we come across Nirode and 

 his two sisters, Monisha and Amla, who suddenly find their 

 perfectly ordinary lives changing irreversibly, under the 

 impact of forces that foretell a greater social churning. 

 Desai transcends the boundaries of reality and imagination 

 with effortless ease, something which makes her characters, 

 their strengths and weaknesses, triumphs and failures, appear 

 touchingly real. The descriptions of a wintry Calcutta are 

 equally evocative ? ?... the tree-lined avenues where houses 

 were lit, comfortable and serene in their warm illumination, 

 unmindful of the fog-horns and the mist swirling through 

 their gardens and across the deserted Maidan where trees 

 loomed like sleeping buffaloes in that white mist...?.

 Simply 

 Khaki (Indialog, 

 Rs 250) by E.N. Rammohan is the story of a remarkable 

 policeman who boasts of possessing a ?khaki soul?. That 

 could explain why the author, after spending thirty five 

 long years in the force, still has the passion to talk about 

 his various exploits ? be it tackling militants in Kashmir 

 or heading the training institute for young officers and 

 probationers or being an advisor to the government of India. 

 Those aspiring to wield the baton may find a wealth of information 

 about the trials and tribulations of a khaki life in these 

 pages. For others, Rammohan?s ?honest account? and the tales 

 of rich rewards reaped in the course of a long and illustrious 

 career may appear a tad pompous.

 I 

 promise to be a good girl, god (Penguin, 

 Rs 150) by Kamini Banga is a collection of poems, 

 written over a period of ten years as the author struggled 

 with breast cancer. It is to Banga?s credit that she has 

 managed to turn the most difficult period of her life into 

 a ?creative mission?. She makes no attempt to conceal either 

 the horror or the pain of her disease and quite rightly 

 too. But, perhaps, the author could have gone about her 

 task in a more imaginative manner. Sample this ? ?There 

 was fear in his eyes/ The day they told him I too was struck./...There 

 was twisted skin/ where her right breast had been.

 The Penguin 

 Guide to the Countries Of The World (Penguin, Rs 

 195) is a compendium which enthuses amatuer quizzers 

 and brings back a smile on the faces of children who always 

 muddle up their geography. The book provides ?authentic? 

 and ?reliable? information on the social, political, and 

 demographic features of 192 countries which are members 

 of the United Nations. One can only hope that the readers 

 will not confuse the Krone with the Swiss Franc after turning 

 over the pages of this book.

 Homespun 

 (Penguin, 

 Rs 295) by Nilita Vachani is a story which is 

 delightfully funny on some occasions and heartbreakingly 

 sad at other times. It spans three generations and brings 

 together a motley group of Wodehousian characters who go 

 on to leave an indelible mark on each other?s lives. Thus, 

 a movie producer with a love for pakoras, a cow that 

 dies of a crank call, a pilot with little skills for flying, 

 and a young girl?s tumultuous quest for her family all find 

 a place in this intricately woven plot that comes full circle 

 after meandering through clever little twists and turns. 

 Crisply written with dollops of humour, Vachani?s book is 

 indeed ?full of history, laughter and tears, and generations 

 of characters that dance off the page?.

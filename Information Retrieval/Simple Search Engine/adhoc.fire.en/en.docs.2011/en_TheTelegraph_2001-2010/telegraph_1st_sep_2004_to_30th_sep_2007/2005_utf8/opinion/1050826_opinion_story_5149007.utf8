 OUT WITH THE TRADE SECRETS

 Sell it well

Perhaps a sociological novel about publishing has been written and, being exact but not believable, has failed to achieve publication. But a novel of sorts that takes in all the paradoxes and apparent contradictions needs to be written. The few histories of publishing houses, usually spun around the founding fathers, have been extremely reticent, devoted mainly to vagaries, and with goody-goody words about their leading authors.

 A true anatomy of publishing like What Happens in Book Publishing needs to be written. Only a clear, lucid account of the many ins-and-outs of Indian publishing, preferably in a novelistic format, could bring about some peace between author and publisher who seem to have become natural antagonists.

 Here are some of the key chapters ? these are the points where misunderstandings arise. First, copyediting, that is, checking out the manuscript for accuracy of facts, inconsistencies and other niggardly details. Second, the role of the sales department which includes book advertising and its promotion. Third, subsidiary rights and permissions, and last of all, business management and accounting. Each of these chapters requires a whole book to itself, but here?s a quick check list of what they mean in Indian publishing today where full scale professionalism is still some way off.

 While copyediting means ?removing errors?, the problem with authors here arises with what publishers regard as ?errors?. In India, where clear, simple language suitable for the target readership is a major problem, even minor corrections become a major diplomatic exercise, especially with celebrity authors. The only way out is to take the author along and explain why the changes would work for the better. But if the author insists on having his way, it is better to give way to him because the manuscript is, after all, his work.

 Many publishing tangles arise from the marketing and sales departments. No author is ever satisfied with his publisher?s efforts. What Indian authors do not realize is that retail outlets for books are limited, booksellers are undercapitalized and therefore don?t take risks, and above all, the market is limited. Here again, the only way to soothe bruised egos is to take the author along, telling him/her of the efforts made and the responses received ? and hope they would be accepted.

 Subsidiary rights and permissions are something that few Indian authors understand. These mean the potential for a book?s spin-off earnings ? translation, serialization, film or TV adaptation, etc. Indian authors who have been published abroad have pulled in those huge advances largely because of the sales of subsidiary rights in translations. 

 Many author want to probe the business management and accounting practices of their publishers. With increasing computerization, there are no secrets any more; publishers would do well to have complete transparency of their operations. But whether this would satisfy authors is another matter.

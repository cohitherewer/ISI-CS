 FALSE VIRTUE

 Abiding by the rule of law cannot be a matter of political strategy. But the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) seems to think differently. That probably is why the party is trying to make a political virtue of Mr Narayan Biswas?s resignation from the Left Front ministry and his subsequent surrender to the law. His arrest may have saved the party and the government further embarrassment, but it leaves questions about the rule of law in Bengal unanswered. The episode shows how the rule of the party prevails over the rule of law in the state. Mr Biswas, who had been a fugitive from justice for nearly 20 years, was not only promoted in the party hierarchy but also made a minister in Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s cabinet. One would think that the party and the government owed the people an apology for not letting the law work all these years. Instead, the party is taking credit for setting an ?example? before the country by asking the minister to surrender to the law. Such rhetoric does not inspire confidence in the party?s respect for the law. 

 There are important lessons for Mr Bhattacharjee in this. He needs to assure people that such blatant violations of the law will not be permitted in future. More important, he has to draw the line between the government and the party more emphatically. Above all, he must see to it that the law is not reduced to a plaything in the hands of politicians. The controversy surrounding Mr Biswas and other CPI(M) workers, who had escaped the law with impunity, gives the chief minister an opportunity to clean up Bengal?s politics. There have been leaders and workers of other parties among such offenders. Mr Biswas?s surrender may force another fugitive from justice, Mr Adhir Chowdhury of the Congress, to follow suit. But the fundamental problem will remain unsolved if the cases are used to score political points. The real issue is to make politics out of bounds for people with criminal records. After the Biswas episode, the left?s pretence of a high moral ground would look even more hollow. Whether it also signals a real change is still uncertain.

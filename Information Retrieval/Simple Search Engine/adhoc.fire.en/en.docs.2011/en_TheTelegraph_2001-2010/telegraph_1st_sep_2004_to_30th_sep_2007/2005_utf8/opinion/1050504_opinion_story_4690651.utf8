 MIND THE KING

 Half-measures are often the worst kind of deception. Nepal?s King Gyanendra has only himself to blame if his decision to lift the emergency has been viewed with more suspicion than enthusiasm. As a ruler who has a dubious reputation for stealing the people?s freedom, he needed to do much more in order to regain their trust. Instead, he continues to suppress far too many freedoms. Despite the release of a few top leaders, most political activists arrested during the emergency continue to be in jail. The voice of the press continues to be muzzled. The dark shadow of the army still darkens most spheres of public life. In fact, the king retains all the powers that he usurped from an elected government on February 1. All this raises serious questions as to what prompted him to end the state of emergency. The obvious answer is that there is no constitutional provision for extending the emergency beyond three months without the approval of parliament. With parliament dissolved, the king had little choice but to lift the emergency. An even more compelling reason could be the diplomatic pressure that India and other countries put on him to restore democracy. 

 New Delhi has reasons to be particularly wary of the king?s moves. Within days of the king assuring India of an early restoration of democracy, a former prime minister of Nepal, Mr Sher Bahadur Deuba, was rearrested. The assurance had prompted India to reconsider whether arms supplies to Nepal, suspended since the imposition of the emergency, should be resumed. No wonder that New Delhi, while welcoming the move to end the emergency, wanted the king to do more. Nepal may need the arms to fight its Maoist rebels. But India needs to be absolutely convinced that the arms would not be used to put down the country?s democratic politics. The king?s actions will carry some conviction only if they help to restore the political process. Unless this is achieved, both the monarchy and the Maoists will continue to threaten political stability in Nepal. For, the longer the mainstream parties are suppressed, the more the Maoists will take over the political space. True, the parties have often betrayed the people?s expectations. But this could not be an excuse for sabotaging the fledgling democracy. A democratic Nepal is the best guarantee for its ? and the region?s ? stability and security.

 SPEAKERS? MEET

 There is a disconcerting tendency in Indian public life to shy away from debate on important issues. The speaker of the Lok Sabha, Mr Somnath Chatterjee, has proved to be the exception to this generalization by convening a meeting of all speakers to discuss the role of the speaker and the wider issue of the separation of powers between the judiciary and the legislature. Mr Chatterjee?s action has been prompted by the Supreme Court?s directive fixing the date for the test of majority for Mr Shibu Soren?s ministry. The prevalent attitude to public discussion is exemplified by the reaction of Mr L.K. Advani, who said that the matter had been resolved by the invitation to Mr Arjun Munda to form the government. Mr Advani is right in believing that the matter has blown over for the moment, and for Jharkhand. But there are much deeper issues involved here which need to be debated and discussed.

 The separation of powers between the three pillars of the state ? the executive, the judiciary and the legislature ? is one of the founding principles of the Indian Constitution. This separation provides the requisite check and balance for the proper functioning of a democracy. Mr Chatterjee feels that the Supreme Court?s decision to fix the date of the floor test encroaches upon the jurisdiction of the legislature and thus violates the principle of the separation of powers. Mr Chatterjee?s belief is not entirely without substance and is shared by many whose concern for democracy and respect for the Supreme Court are above question. A wide-ranging debate on the separation of powers is urgently required in the present context of Indian politics. There have been many instances when one of the three organs of the state has been forced to transgress its limits and boundaries. The Emergency imposed by Indira Gandhi is a notorious example, but there have been other transgressions of a lesser scale. In the Jharkhand affair, there is a prima facie case to argue that the apex court may have stepped outside its limits. The action may have been justified by the failures of the Jharkhand governor. But this underlines a moot point: should one organ of the state step in to correct or compensate for the dysfunctions of another? Can there ever be valid grounds for violating the separation of powers laid down in the Constitution? The meeting convened by Mr Chatterjee should look at such questions and take the debate beyond Jharkhand and the role of speakers.

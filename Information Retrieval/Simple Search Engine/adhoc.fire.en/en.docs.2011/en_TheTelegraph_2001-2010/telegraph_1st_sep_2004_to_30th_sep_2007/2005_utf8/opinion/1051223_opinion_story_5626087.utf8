 Paperback Pickings

 Encounters of the plural kind

 Free 

 expression is no offence (Penguin, ?4.50) edited 

 by Lisa Appignanesi has been published in association 

 with English PEN. One of PEN?s most important activities 

 is to fight for the right of artists, writers and everybody 

 else to say what they think without being penalized or persecuted. 

 The volume is a collection of powerful voices arguing against 

 the new law in England criminalizing the dangerously vague 

 phenomenon, ?religious hatred?. Writers include Salman Rushdie, 

 who never thought of himself as a writer on religion till 

 a religion came after him, Rowan Atkinson, Gurpreet Kaur 

 Bhatti, Hanif Kureishi and Ian Buruma. 

 doon 

 on a sunday (Rupa, Rs 95) by David 

 Keeling is an account of relaxed Sundays in Dehra Doon. 

 That the author, retired from the British Foreign Service, 

 decided to spend his days amid the peaceful beauty of Dehra 

 Doon is enough explanation for the warmth and admiration 

 that underlie the short, often humorous, chapters. Nice 

 reading for an idle afternoon.

 ramu: 

 an indian boy?s story (Promilla, Rs 395) 

 by Henry Scholberg is a narrative spun out of encounters: 

 of a boy on the streets of Delhi with an American, of an 

 American man with Anglo-Indians and a resident Swede, of 

 all of them, in various combinations, with bankers, policemen, 

 neighbours and photography enthusiasts. The plot spans continents 

 and cultures, and the happy end is achieved only by the 

 kindness of a white man.

 new 

 amp; old wars: organized violence in a global era 

 (Natraj, Rs 350) by Mary Kaldor attempts 

 to show why the lessening of interstate wars has not reduced 

 the numbers of the dead in other kinds of conflict. These 

 are the ?new wars?, far more difficult to define and contain 

 than the ?old?. Informative and analytical, the discussion 

 elucidates how elements of old wars have been remixed with 

 organized violence and targeted violations of human rights 

 in a new form of aggression. 

 The 

 Bhagavad gita (Penguin, Rs 250) 

 translated by Bibek Debroy provides a highly useful 

 parallel text, with a concise introduction and extensive 

 notes. It is most helpful for those with no access to either 

 Sanskrit or any of the vernaculars.

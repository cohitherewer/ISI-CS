 Letters to Editor

 Out of the box

 Sir ? The publication of the book, The Mitrokhin Archive II: The KGB and the World, in the UK, has been widely reviewed by the Indian media. The Telegraph?s contributions have made for interesting reading. One aspect of the coverage deserves comment. Amit Roy opines in ?KGB story: Don?t miss footnotes? (Sept 8) that the publication of the names of a few individuals in the book is ?legally safe? as they are ?usually of people who are dead...since the dead cannot be libelled.? It is not clear to me which country?s law Roy had in mind while writing this. But under Indian law, the Indian Penal Code of 1860 to be precise, libel amounting to defamation may very well extend to persons who are no longer living, and it is punishable. Explanation 1 to Section 499 of the IPC says clearly that ?It may amount to defamation to impute anything to a deceased person, if the imputation would harm the reputation of that person if living, and is intended to be hurtful to the feelings of his family or other near relatives.? The book is due to be published in India and it should come as no surprise if litigation follows soon after, as the legal grounds for it undoubtedly exist.

 Yours faithfully,

Anshuman Chakraborty, Wellington, New Zealand

 Sir ? Volume II of the Mitrokhin has not revealed anything new but has only confirmed what has already been suspected (?India govt easy prey: KGB files?, Sept 18). The book has neither disclosed the names of the KGB agents in India nor those of the journalists who received money from the KGB. 

 There was a strong rumour all along that the Soviet Union, particularly the KGB, penetrated the government through bribes and other corrupt means, trying to dictate policies, with the objective of influencing public opinion. Whether the money thus spent by the KGB was wasted is another issue, but from the Indian viewpoint, given American hostility to Indira Gandhi and support to Yahya Khan during the 1971 crisis, the money spent by the KGB to influence Indian policies seems to be just a measure of extreme caution rather than a necessity. The Soviet Union, already drifting towards economic collapse, needed friends to keep its economy afloat and also to maintain its image as a superpower. India?s friendship was important to keep its own house within the Union and in East Europe in order.

 Yours faithfully,

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta 

 Sir ? While Amit Roy?s report clearly mentions that the former Soviet intelligence officer, Vasili Mitrokhin, is inaccessible to journalists since he died last year, the editorial, ?Secret history? (Sept 21) says that he is ?now a defector living in Britain?. Roy is correct.

 From related reports on Christopher Andrew?s Mitrokhin Archives, we gather that as many as ten Indian newspapers were under the payroll of the KGB. That was in the Sixties and early Seventies. But what about now? Take The Telegraph, which has often been a harsh critic of the Iraq war, especially in its editorial pages, while printing pictures of US soldiers offering flowers to Iraqi kids, or striking ?happy? poses with them in its foreign pages. The same goes for most other newspapers and television channels. The only way to control a democracy is by influencing the thought processes of its citizens. Unlike in the case of dictatorships, where one needs only to target the dictator, this is a very difficult job. No wonder ? if we are to believe the Mitrokhin reports ? the KGB ultimately failed to sway the Indians. But success has been reported in certain democracies of the world, where sustained spin on newscasting has managed to fox the voting majority. If all of India is to shine in the coming decades, I hope this will never happen to our national media.

 Yours faithfully

Prosenjit Roy, Calcutta 

 Sir ? I do not see why the KGB operation in India in the Seventies should make headlines. Despite the non-aligned movement, there was always a pro-Soviet tilt in India?s foreign policy. As such, the erstwhile KGB?s First Chief Directorate had ten departments covering operations worldwide (source: John Barron?s KGB ? The Secret Work of Soviet Secret Agents). Of these, the 7th Department?s jurisdiction comprised Japan, India, Indonesia, the Philippines and much of the rest of Asia. Being a third world nation with a huge population, immense natural resources and a strategic geographical location, India would have been a juicy target for any superpower?s intelligence organization. However, given India?s pro-Soviet stance then, it would have been a fairly undemanding task for the KGB. The details of KGB operations in India can at best make for thrilling reading.

 Yours faithfully,

Amit Banerjee, Calcutta 

 Sir ? ?Soviet spy den in Indira?s India? (Sept 18) is only half the story. What the report has selectively bypassed is the role of the press thirty years ago. The average Indian has always been sceptical about the integrity of politicians, so corruption in political parties do not surprise us any more. But the role of the unnamed ten sycophant newspapers whose prime objective was to undermine Indira Gandhi?s opponents is the real revelation. What is more shameful than the Congress accepting bribe from the KGB is that one of the pillars of Indian democracy, the Indian press, sold its freedom to the Soviets. It is time to dig out the skeletons of the double agents.

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir ? What will it take for our national parties to realize that striking a bond with the people is more important than winning the confidence of external powers? 

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad

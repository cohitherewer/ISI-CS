 Out and About

 Panchgani ? last heard of for its boarding schools ? has perhaps never seen a bash like the one Aamir Khan will host to celebrate his marriage to Kiran Rao on December 28. And now it seems that even the two children from his first marriage will troop in to throw confetti over papas head. Okay, maybe were getting a bit carried away, but both Junaid and Ira seem ready to attend their fathers reception in the hill station along with a number of guests. Aamir has apparently hired a fleet of limousines to ferry the invitees back and forth from Mumbai. Reena ? Aamirs first wife of 15 years, from whom he was divorced in 2002 ? however, wont be there to bless the newly-weds. 

 Madonna

 Shes never had much patience with critics, but for once, this is a rebuke Madonna cant really ignore. After all, this time its her nine-year-old daughter Lourdes who has spoken out against mommys sartorial sense. But its not what the Material Girl wears on stage that has daughter dearest fretting. Lourdes, apparently, is more concerned about the appalling tracksuits that Madonna wears to her school when she goes to pick her up. Lourdes is, in fact, so exasperated that she ended up asking mum: Why cant you be like other normal mothers? Mommy, if shes hurt, is keeping the scars well hidden behind the make-up and that beatific smile. Its not all that black, though. Son Rocco thinks that mommy is beautiful, no matter what. Some cheer for mommy dear, that.

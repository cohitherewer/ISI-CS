 LAW OF THE HILL

 Laws are no substitutes for political will. A new law has now been put in place to change some features of the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council. But even this legislative move may not end the deadlock over the council, unless the West Bengal government and Mr Subash Ghisingh have a common agenda for the council?s success. It is possible that Mr Ghisingh, who has been the council?s chairman since its inception, will still find flaws in the new law. He may still be unhappy with the division of powers between the council and the state government. The important question, however, is whether he sees the council fulfilling the aspirations of the people of Darjeeling for a measure of self-rule. Having run it for 17 long years, Mr Ghisingh cannot claim that the council has completely failed to achieve its purpose. He has to take the responsibility for both the successes and failures of the council. This is not to suggest, though, that there was no scope for further improvements in the council?s functioning. It is a different matter if Mr Ghisingh is more concerned with his own control over the council. Unfortunately, his recent words and actions seem to give precisely this impression. He would have the council only on his terms or plunge Darjeeling into chaos.

 Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, therefore, has to hope ? and work ? for a solution that is more political than legal. The new law is only the first step in that direction. The chief minister has also succeeded in persuading Mr Ghisingh to withdraw his call for a three-day strike in Darjeeling. The more difficult task now is to agree on how to conduct the next elections to the council. Given the fact that the term of the present council has been extended twice, another such extension would expose the government to the charge of succumbing to Mr Ghisingh?s blackmail. No matter how powerful he still is, Mr Ghisingh cannot be allowed to deny the people of Darjeeling the rule of law. Most political parties, including Mr Bhattacharjee?s own Communist Party of India (Marxist), have rightly suggested that an interim arrangement for the council should involve a cross-section of them along with Mr Ghisingh or his nominees. After all, peace in the hills remains the primary concern of the people. They need a popularly elected council to represent their aspirations. But the elections would be futile if they mean a return to the violent days of the mid-Eighties.

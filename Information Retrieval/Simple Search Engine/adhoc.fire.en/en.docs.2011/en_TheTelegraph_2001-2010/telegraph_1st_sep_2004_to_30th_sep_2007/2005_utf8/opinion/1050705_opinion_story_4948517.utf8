 MONSOON PANIC

 The moment there are question marks about the monsoon, forecasts of gross domestic product growth are lowered. The year, 2005-06, is a case in point. No forecaster expects GDP growth of more than 7 per cent. However, how sensitive is Indian agriculture to monsoons? And how important is agriculture to GDP growth? In 2003-04, the primary sector accounted for 21.71 per cent of the GDP. However, this is the entire primary sector, and includes mining and quarrying. Agriculture proper accounts for only 19.6 per cent of the GDP and within agriculture, food-grains, subject to monsoon vagaries, accounts for 52 per cent of the value of output. The impact of the monsoon is a function of the temporal and geographical spread of the rains and all-India figures are misleading. Indeed, only 35 per cent of land area is irrigated and there are woes associated with dry-land farming, including the spectre of farmer suicides. How much contribution do dry-land areas make to agricultural output? Not much and the argument becomes stronger if one considers the value of agricultural output, rather than crop output or food-grains output, alone. 

 There will be arguments that agriculture?s contribution to GDP is more than direct effects alone. Agriculture is a source of raw materials, and agricultural income drives demand for industrial products. There is increasing rural prosperity in India and projections of the National Council for Applied Economic Research suggest this will increase. However, a breakup of rural markets shows that, be it consumer durables or FMCG products, dry-land areas make small contributions. While monsoon failure may have severe local impact in Rajasthan or Madhya Pradesh, the macro contribution is insignificant. Seventy-two per cent of India?s workforce may be in the rural sector, but only 57 per cent obtains a living from agriculture. Ipso facto, the government?s equation of an agricultural policy with a rural development policy is misplaced, as is the equation of an agricultural policy with a food-grains policy, interpreted as a rice and wheat policy. Instead of harping on irrigation and procurement prices, policy should encourage diversification away from on-farm activities. Why does the government then create paranoia about monsoon failure? Probably because it wants to lower expectations about GDP growth.

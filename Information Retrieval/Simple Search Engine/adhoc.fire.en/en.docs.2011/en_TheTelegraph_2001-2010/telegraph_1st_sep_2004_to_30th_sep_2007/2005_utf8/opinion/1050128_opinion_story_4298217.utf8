 Letters to Editor

 Over their bodies

 Sir ? When it comes to electioneering, no one can do it like Bihar. So while parents beat their chests over missing children and friends go without their tiffin in schools in protest, Bihar?s politicians have a ball (?Bihar children on warpath over kidnap?, Jan 25). For them the little ones have proved the ideal weapons to fight their electoral battles with. For if rape and butchery or the slanging match over seat-sharing couldn?t unsettle the status quo in the state, it is hoped that vanished middle class children will. Are we then witnessing another momentous change in Bihar politics ? a shift from caste to class? But does it have to be over the bodies of children? Is this what India, in the 55th year of the republic, has to give to the young? Will the children of Bihar (and maybe some other states next year) still be asked why they boycotted the Republic Day celebrations?

 Yours faithfully,

J. Acharya, Calcutta

 Tread carefully

 Sir ? It was horrifying to read about passengers being pushed out of the train by jawans, resulting in the death of six of them. Arranging for plainclothes policemen to travel in trains to ensure the safety of passengers in unreserved compartments is neither practical nor a permanent solution (?Throw-buster cops-on trains?, Jan 25). We have to look at the reason behind such criminal behaviour. The delay in the legal process is one factor which, given its lopsidedness, encourages people to act in this manner. Even when a case is resolved, look at the way in which justice is administered. For example, when an accused is convicted and sentenced under several sections of the criminal procedure code, the sentences pronounced are often allowed to run concurrently, which dilutes the punishment. In the United States of America, all the sentences are taken into consideration and sometimes they run for more than a hundred years. Only such a stringent exercise of justice will bring order into our lives and ensure that citizens, as well as soldiers, are law-abiding. 

 Yours faithfully, 

C.V. Krishnamoorthy, Calcutta

 Sir ? The arrogance of the jawans who killed fellow passengers on the Farakka Express is a matter of deep anguish. ?Go to hell if you can?t make a room for us? is how a terrorist would speak, not a soldier. The army is supposed to be the epitome of bravery, but if soldiers behave insanely, how can the people place their fate in their hands?

 Yours faithfully,

Amrit Amlan Pattanaik, 

 Cuttack

 Sir ? Are Indian armymen being trained to behave humanely with foreigners and brutally with Indians? If not, how can they push out passengers from a speeding train? And this is not the first example of unpardonable behaviour on their part. How can they treat Indian civilians like animals and yet claim credit for doing ?excellent work? in the tsunami-affected areas in Sri Lanka? In the latter, they are celebrated as heroes for their honesty and hard work. Why this two-facedness of the Indian army, the one in Shikohabad just the opposite of that in Sri Lanka? 

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur 

 Sir ? It is possible that the soldiers did not know of the train running on the parallel track when they pushed out the passengers from the train. But that is no reason to absolve them of murder. Even if one were to believe that the compartment was one reserved for the military personnel, was this any way to carry out an argument? 

 Yours faithfully,

J.S. Acharya, Hyderabad

 Sir ? Soldiers have now assumed the role of goons who often travel on rail (?Protector turns killer on rails,? Jan 24). It is impossible to believe that people could be killed over an argument about some seats, and that too by men in uniform. But when the nephew of a prime minister is not spared, why should the jawans worry about commoners? I think our soldiers have a wrong notion about ?patriotism?. The word not only means protecting the nation under threat, it also implies harbouring love for the country?s people. The only hope is in creating a strong public opinion against all such actions by the army, as also its denial of human rights across the country. 

 Yours faithfully,

Anjan Chatterjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? There are millions of Indians who travel every day on public transport without getting a place to sit. And thousands of others who pay their rail fares, but travel standing. Why should the army misuse its power and position and demand exceptional treatment?

 Yours faithfully,

Paroma Roy, Calcutta

 Sir ? That an altercation broke out on the Farakka Express when the soldiers? demanded that others leave the compartment is an indication that people are neither fooled easily, nor are they in awe of the army. The naked protest in Imphal have somehow made citizens more aware of army violations. Either the army takes more care while interacting with civilians or face the brunt of public anger and mistrust.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Chatterjee, Calcutta

 HONOUR SANS SUBSTANCE

 In the early 20th century, a Bengali lyricist dreamed of the time when India would take its seat in the top table among nations. That dream is close to being fulfilled but with a qualifying clause which really takes away all substance from the achievement. Mr Kofi Annan, the secretary-general of the United Nations, announced in no uncertain terms that there will be no veto powers for the additional members in the security council of the UN. India is an aspirant to be a member of the security council and has been lobbying hard to fulfil the aspiration. Even if India gets the coveted prize of a permanent seat in the security council, it will bring little joy. India will have no powers as Mr Annan made clear. India can thus get a place at the high table but will not be allowed to eat from it.

 Since no adequate reasons are being given for the decision that the additional members will be without powers of veto, it will not be unfair to assume that the UN believes in a hierarchy of nations. It believes that some countries are powerful and important enough to be members of the security council with all the attendant rights and privileges. There are other countries which can be part of the security council, take part in all the discussions but not enjoy all the rights, especially the most important right of veto. In other words, there are first-class members of the security council enjoying the veto, and there are second-class members without rights. This is clearly an unacceptable situation. The UN grew on the assumption of parity between nations. There can be an argument that there should not be any further additions to the membership of the security council. But to actually argue that there should be additional members but they should not have full rights is breathtakingly undemocratic. It is amazing that Mr Annan could articulate such a principle without blushing.

 Given Mr Annan?s announcement and the humiliation implicit in it, India should perhaps rethink its aspirations. It is difficult to conceive of any gain or honour that might come India?s way if it is elevated to a membership of the security council without veto powers. In fact, India should work to create a body of opinion to protest against the prevailing attitude of the powers that be in the UN, which arbitrarily decide that there should be a hierarchy of nations within the security council. Someone once remarked that to be published by the Clarendon Press was like being married to a dowager: the honour was more important than the pleasure. A permanent seat in the security council without veto powers is also somewhat similar: the honour is more important than the power. India would be better off outside the security council than within it as a second class-member. No honour is better than dishonour.

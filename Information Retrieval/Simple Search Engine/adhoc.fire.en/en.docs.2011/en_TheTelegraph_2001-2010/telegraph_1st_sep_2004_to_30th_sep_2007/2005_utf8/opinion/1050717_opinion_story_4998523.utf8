 THE MAGIC OF HARRY

 Phenomenon is the only word to describe it. Nothing else quite captures the response to the Harry Potter books. A decade ago, J.K. Rowling was an unknown writer in a caf?, living on her dreams. With the publication in 1997 of the first book in the Harry Potter series ? Harry Potter and the Philosopher?s Stone ? her dreams had begun to turn into reality. With the publication of the fifth book (Rowling planned to write seven), she was richer than the Queen. She had also authored a cult. What is even more important is that everyone connected with the world of books ? readers, writers, publishers, booksellers and so on ? has reasons to be grateful to Rowling and her creation. Harry Potter has given an unprecedented boost to the book trade. Parents, worried about their children spending too much time on the net or in front of the idiot box, are relieved that boys and girls are becoming avid readers. Harry Potter has engendered a sociological revolution wherever English is read.

 The publication of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince follows a familiar trend. The figures are staggering: 130, 000 copies have been pre-sold in India alone. And the expectation is that by the end of the year, sales will have crossed 200,000. No book in India, including Arundhati Roy?s The God of Small Things, has ever had it so good. By the time this appears in print, many of those 130,000 copies will be off the shelves in bookshops, and kids in the major cities will be well on their way to discovering the identity of the half-blood prince. The secrecy around this identity is part of the hype that surrounds this book. The distance that Harry Potter has traversed is measured by the fact that the first book of the series had an initial print run of 2,000. The sixth one is expected to sell 2 million copies in the United Kingdom in 24 hours. The online retailer, Amazon, has orders for 350,000 copies in the UK alone.

 It is facile to explain the success of Harry by the hype. This would only do the boy in round glasses and his creator a disservice. Rowling?s world of magic empowers marginalized people by endowing them with unusual qualities. She creates a world of the fabulous and mingles it with suspense, complete with clues and connections. There is in the novels a prevailing atmosphere of foreboding which disappears only at the end with things working out well for Potter and his gang. She thus reworks some of the well-known narrative strategies that have succeeded in children?s fiction. Yet, an analysis of these elements is not enough to explain the success of Rowling as a writer of children?s books. No other children?s book has ever sold as much as her books have.

 The other imponderable is the question: will Potter stand the test of time? Will he be read after fifty years, in the manner William is read even today? It is difficult to answer this because the hype does tend to cloud judgment. But whatever be the verdict of history, there can be no denying that Rowling and Harry Potter made a difference to book-lovers at the turn of the century.

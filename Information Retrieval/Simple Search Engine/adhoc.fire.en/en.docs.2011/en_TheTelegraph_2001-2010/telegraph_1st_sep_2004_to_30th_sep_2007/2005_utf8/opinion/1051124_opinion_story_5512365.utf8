 RIGHT SEX

 Ignorance about the way sex works can hardly be the incitement behind rape. But, taken to its logical limit, the public interest litigation brought before the Supreme Court recently would seem to imply just that. Making sex education compulsory in schools is one of the suggestions offered in the PIL to increase the sense of security among women in New Delhi by reducing incidents of rape. The Supreme Court, however, has ruled that sex education cannot be brought under the purview of rights by making it part of the right to education. The court has expressed itself satisfied with the steps regarding sex education in schools that the Delhi government has listed in its affidavit. There are a number of reasons, not solely practical, why such a decision should seem appropriate. In a country in which schools accommodate students with very different backgrounds from regions and societies as different, sex education has often to be approached with sensitiveness and care. Each school needs to shape its lessons according to its student population. As long as there is full awareness of the immense importance of the subject, and that awareness is acted upon without fail, the how and when of sex education should be left to the schools themselves. To pronounce it as a right would smack too much of an external imposition.

 The notion of ?right? too is a troubled one. Every child has the right to be educated ? but this also assumes a certain quality in the education received. If a child cannot spell or subtract after a few years, as has been known to happen, he has been given his right without its benefit. The content of lessons as well as the method of teaching are important factors in the right to education. A truly aware administration would make sex education a part of a syllabus of growing up skills. One goal of education is surely to create mature and capable adults. It also helps build attitudes. The PIL makes a relevant point, but it needs filling out. Rape is the outcome of skewed attitudes towards women and towards power that society nurtures. Reducing violence towards women requires a change of these general attitudes. Education, not just sex education, geared towards inculcating such a change is what is most needed. That change would not take place if sex education were simply to be made a right. There is no short cut.

 TRESPASSERS ARE REWARDED

 In Bihar, as elsewhere, politicians are looking beyond their traditional support bases for political survival, writes Tapas Chakraborty

 Playing the part

 In elections, as in football, the obvious strategy is to penetrate the rival?s first line of defence as quickly as possible. In Bihar, political parties are doing just that. But in the mad scramble for votes, they seem to be forgetting the Mandal and kamandal politics that had ushered in a new era in Bihar politics.

 In both Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, national and regional outfits had traditionally stuck to their carefully nurtured support bases. Eventually, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Laloo Prasad Yadav came to be associated with their Yadav and Muslim bases, Ram Vilas Paswan and Mayavati with their Dalit and backward classes support base, and the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress with a predominantly upper caste base. When Mandal and the post-Mandal temple movement gathered force and led to further stratification of votes, politicians came to guard their support bases more zealously. But the last five years seem to have changed it all. The emerging players in Bihar are breaking into the support bases of their rival players. 

 Has this race to expand the vote base across the caste line made the politics of the Mandal era irrelevant? At least the images thrown up by political activities in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar seem to prove that.

 During Mayavati?s birthday bash in Delhi last month, she was shown by the electronic media accepting laddu from S.C. Mishra, a Rajya Sabha member who happens to be a Brahmin and belongs to the much-maligned Manuwadi group. Mayavati later clarified her position. A softening of her stand on the Manuwadis did not mean she was not against Brahmins per se. In fact, Mayavati plans to make strong inroads into the BJP vote bank by wooing the upper castes. Mulayam Singh Yadav is similarly trying to lure caste groups other than his traditional voters. His party?s winning of 38 parliamentary seats in the last general elections is attributed to his being able to lure the Thakurs to vote for him.

 Bihar?s upper caste voters, who constitute a little over 13 per cent of the electorate, have played second fiddle since Mandal happened. This time it is different, and not because they themselves are in a position to help a party win, but because their votes will give any party an edge over its rivals.

 Just how well caste coalitions can work in Bihar became evident in the 2004 general elections when a Laloo- Paswan unity relegated other players to a corner. The Laloo-Paswan combine won 29 seats while the Janata Dal (U) and the BJP won only 11. But for Paswan, who has always projected himself as an alternative to Laloo Yadav, this friendship was bound to be temporary. Besides the caste base both Laloo Yadav and Paswan seek to represent respectively have been at loggerheads traditionally for a combination of factors. When they fell apart on the eve of this state poll, they faced a new challenge. 

 Laloo Yadav?s party, which had won 164 seats in 1995, found its numbers reduced to 122 seats in the 2000 polls. His position is more vulnerable this time with the M-Y equation weakened by the Muslim tilt towards the Congress. Paswan, aware of the limitations of the backward caste agenda, has tried to rope in both Yadavs and upper caste voters. On the other hand, the BJP and the Congress have tried to make a dent in OBC votes too. In their campaign, all the leaders have toned down their traditional rhetoric. The BJP leaders, for example, in minority areas like Phulwarisherif or Siwan are likely to hide their saffron garb. The rules of the game have changed.

 For Laloo Yadav, the changes began early. In 1999, he started by embracing a Brahmin from the Samata Party, Shivanand Tiwari, who had launched a crusade against him in connection with the fodder scam. Next he sought a Koeri leader. And last year when the JD(U) split, Laloo Yadav poached another Brahmin leader, Raghunath Jha. For the last couple of years, Laloo Yadav had been dangling Akhilesh Singh as his mascot for the Bhumihar castes. So after Singh won his parliamentary seat last year, he was made a minister at the Centre and his wife offered a ticket to contest the state polls. Jagdanand Singh was the Rashtriya Janata Dal?s Rajput face. The RJD also tried to accommodate Kanti Singh?s husband to accommodate more Rajputs. 

 Paswan has his own share of upper caste leaders ? Munna Shukla, Pappu Yadav, Rajo Singh. Names that spell terror. Paswan has also tried to make a more broader dent in Laloo Yadav?s vote base by asking uncomfortable questions like why do 67 per cent of the 26 lakh Dalits in Bihar still do not have a house? To minority voters he asks why 48.5 per cent of them still live below poverty line despite the RJD.

 In rural Bihar, feudal hegemony has been dying a natural death except in some districts of north Bihar. This has also contributed to realignments of power. The hardcore left in the Dalit colonies of Bhojpur or West Champaran have failed to make the voices of the oppressed heard at the national platform. So both the uppercaste voters and dalits this time are likely to go beyond their traditional loyalties. 

 This vote in Bihar will thus mark a change in voter attitude. It will be impractical to think that caste alliances will revive traditional ties as no one group will be confined to its own caste leaders. A 24-year-old Yadav post-graduate in Madhepura said in 1999, ?Why should I stick to my own caste leader when he couldn?t bring me the fruit of being educated?? Laloo Yadav was swept off his seat that year because of this anger. If this sentiment becomes pervasive, it will be the victory of democracy.

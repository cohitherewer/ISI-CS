 Letters to Editor

 Officers with wings

 Sir ? K.P. Nayar gives the Research and Analysis Wing more than its due when he compares it with the Central Intelligence Agency (?Good spies, bad spies?, Jan 12). The RAW neither commands such authority nor respect in the establishment as the CIA, whose activities have shaped American history, just as the KGB?s have Russian history. For an agency born a few decades ago, this is probably too much to expect. But much as Nayar would have us believe otherwise, there is some justification in the babus? regarding RAW as a ?milch cow?. And they obviously know the best. Nayar?s article itself shows how shamelessly RAW officers have exploited their extra-legal authority for personal gains, and what is worse, got away with it. The problem is not with the officers on deputation, but the lack of discipline and the system itself. And that is unlikely to change in a hurry.

 Yours faithfully,

J. Acharya, Calcutta

 Unkindest cut

 Sir ? I really do not understand why Ramachandra Guha has to bring up the ?Bengali? sense of hurt while talking about Sourav Ganguly?s rise to captaincy (?Two cheers for Ganguly?, Jan 8). The most shocking allegation is of ?nepotism? in Ganguly?s selection in 1996. Can Guha substantiate it? 

 Guha cannot disagree with the fact that Ganguly has been the most successful captain the Indian team has ever had. It is not by fluke that he has come to head the team. He has proved his mettle and this is why selectors have looked beyond cricketers like Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid to choose and retain Ganguly as the skipper. Stepping down from the position is a decision that should be left to Ganguly alone. Till then, let him enjoy the game. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sumant Poddar, Calcutta

 Sir ? The truth about Sourav Ganguly is that he has the same narcissistic traits that have caused the downfall of several maharajahs. It is this flaw that prompts Ganguly?s errors in judgment. How else can one justify his absence from the crucial encounter with the Australians in the recent Border-Gavaskar Trophy in India? A mysterious injury is no excuse. Ganguly also does not believe that a match is open till the last ball is bowled. His usual response in such situations is either to thrust himself on others or rope in his favourites. As the match draws to a close, he looks more and more devastated. Compare his lack of composure to the way Steve Waugh, Nasser Hussain and Hansie Cronje conducted themselves under similar circumstances. Ganguly obviously is not in the same league. These men played for their teams and not to satisfy their own whims.

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad

 Sir ? Ramachandra Guha fails to realize that former Indian captains have been even less successful with the bat and the ball than Sourav Ganguly. Also, unlike Rahul Dravid, Ganguly did not have the services of ever-eager coaches during his formative years to hone his skills since in those days the eastern zone, particularly Bengal, was written off. Whatever Ganguly has achieved is through his own grit and determination. He has had to face snide comments and rundowns from commentators belonging to the cricket heartland. 

 In the mid-Seventies, when Bombay dictated terms, Dilip Vengsarkar was played repeatedly till he managed to play straight and finally fill the vacuum in the middle order. No comments were heard from the Guhas of the erstwhile world then. The opening partner?s slot of the mercurial Sunil Gavaskar rotated among many before Chetan Chauhan decided to drop anchor at the other end. Even minnows like Sudhir Nayak managed to find a place at the expense of a far better option in Gopal Bose. Unfortunately, Ganguly did not have the luxury of such parochial indulgence on the field, save possibly the ?Dalmia? factor. There are numerous instances where test probables have had to hang up their boots because they hailed from the wrong zone. Guha should have looked into these factors before using Jawaharlal Nehru to couch his criticism and smother the Bengali pique. 

 Yours faithfully,

Susenjit Guha, Calcutta

 Sir ? I have been born and brought up in this city and been a regular visitor to the galleries, be it to watch football or cricket. If people think Bengalis have always felt victimized, they are wrong. I am witness to numerous instances where players in Bengal have resorted to unsporting means to win matches. Victimhood was the last thing on their minds. 

 So far as Sourav Ganguly is concerned, I am sure no other country would have allowed him the liberty to play after such repeated poor showings or for spoiling the chances of his juniors. Ganguly continues to remain skipper because of his control over the media and corporate sponsors. 

 Yours faithfully,

V.S. Giri, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir ? It is impossible to drill sense into smokers who think smoking is as basic an activity as eating. Suggest it to a co-passenger that he should drop his cigarette, and you?ll get a question dripping with sarcasm, ?Is it bothering you??Well, yes. It bothers that people still smoke on public vehicles and in public spaces despite there being a ban against their doing so. A simple question. What will stop them since it is apparent that the law is not enough?

 Yours faithfully,

Manobina Nanda, Calcutta

 THE DIRECTION OF LOVE

 Linguistic nationalisms thrive on chastening women in the name of honour, argues Janaki Nair

 Away from censure

 Now we know: pre-marital love between Indians can blossom, but only on the distant shores of Australia. Salaam Namaste?s celebration of a live-in love, which could even have produced a love-child, is set entirely in worlds beyond the reach of parents, neighbours and, as we now have it, litigants and agitators on behalf of female chastity and ?honour?. The stain on national honour by the arrival of a love-child in Salaam Namaste is prevented by the timely production by the hero of a ring in the birthing room. Birthing squalls thus come safely after the legal bond, and conjugality is saved, even among Antipodean Indians. 

 No such luck, it appears, attends the lives of real life heroines. They are often loved to death by men who, once spurned, wield the knife or acid bottle with great skill. South Indian cinema has, over the last twenty years or so, carefully nurtured this version of loving, a unidirectional flow of feeling from man to woman, whose outcomes are always predictable. In one film, Mohanlal plays a police officer who ties the woman he ?loves? to a tree and compels her to say the three little words. Vishnuvardhan, the Kannada actor, playfully whipped his heroines into submission, as did Rajnikanth in many a Tamil film. Recently when the filmic narrative called for Rajnikanth to be slapped by a woman, the hero?s honour was recouped on the streets by his angry fans. 

 The avalanche of protests against Kushboo?s candid acknowledgement of pre-marital sex in India is no sudden departure from the deep misogyny that marks the world of South Indian films and several progressive South Indian social movements. Tamil nationalism, like other linguistic nationalisms, founded on the love of the language and the soil, had long ago achieved the division of labour between the feminized language, Tamilttay, and its masculine devotees. The Dalit movement in its most recent incarnation, led by the Dalit Panthers of India, has done nothing to disturb this masculinist discourse. When a college girl was harassed to death on Chennai streets in 1998, debates between Dravidian parties focussed on the urgency of getting young women back into pavadai-davanis (long skirts and upper cloths) to recoup Tamil modesty that had disappeared with the universal adoption of the salwar-kameez. The imagined Tamil woman remains a chaste, home-loving creature, content to leave the world of politics, Dalit or otherwise, to their men. 

 Real women, on the other hand, are a different matter. In some cases, they are tolerated as Magnificent Exceptions, or else how would we explain Jayalalithaa?s political success, not to say her sexuality? Others who are politically or economically successful are less fortunate. When the Tamil actor, Thankar Bacchan, equated Tamil actresses with prostitutes recently, it was Kushboo among others who initiated the protests and demanded an apology, though not in the name of a parochial womanhood. 

 No amount of evidence of the history of Indian sexuality and its contemporary forms will shake the zealots who demand the chaste female as the standard of linguistic honour. An equal and opposite component of this honour is the long institutionalized tolerance of the bigamous men in the ?two households?, the periaveedu and the chinnaveedu (the big and the small house), exemplified by the twin homes of M. Karunanidhi himself. Bigamous men and chaste women together make up the hypermasculinist realm of Tamil honour. 

 The attacks on Kushboo are a case of locking the stable door after the horse has bolted, a violent reassertion of women into worlds that at least some of them have left behind. Tamil nationalists may remain weak-kneed in the face of challenges to their cherished imagined women. It is hardly a feminist revolution that has altered the playing field. The AIDS epidemic shook the moralism that marked public discussions of Indian sexuality, and programmes now target women directly. Here too, there was only reluctant admission of male promiscuity. The unprecedented sexualization of the visual space, and the recognition of women as consumers with deep pockets has had unintended, and not necessarily positive, consequences which cannot be easily reconciled with notions of Tamil, or indeed any other, honour.

 The slew of cases filed against Kushboo are fresh signs of how dependent Tamil (or any other) honour is on the apparatuses of the state to strengthen its claims. The law here has been invoked in ways that are truly bizarre: only by making the eponymous Tamil woman a justiciable figure can Kushboo or the periodical publisher be charged under IPC sections 499, 500 and 501 which relate to defamation. Can such an ?imagined? woman seek justice? Of which Tamil woman are the PMK and the DPI the representatives when they disallow other full-blooded Tamil women such as Suhasini from speaking on behalf of Kushboo? The other grounds on which the protestors have sought to harass Kushboo are equally contradictory: Section 505 1(b) that pertains ?to making statements conducing to public mischief? has been invoked by those engaging in the public mischief themselves! 

 When the controversy blows over, it will still be the woman who stands chastened, warned, in the name of an imagined womanhood, against violating an ?honour? for which they have no further use. One can, and must fervently hope that there are local political reasons for this intemperate attack! The weakly heard, and largely ignored voices of protest from the women?s and civil rights movement, will no doubt be dismissed as signs of an upper-caste resistance to lower-caste forms of self-definition. But as long as such self-definitions ignore, or worse, depend on, the subordination of the woman, they cannot represent a truly democratic move away from the forms of oppression that had long held them in thrall.

 YET AGAIN

 If they had their way, not a few Indian politicians would have democracy only on their terms. Mr Subash Ghisingh is easily the pick of such leaders. He has managed to get and stall elections in Darjeeling on his terms. And he has done so by threatening to plunge the hills into violence if his wish is not granted. The Centre and the West Bengal government are understandably relieved that he now wants the polls to the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council to be held ?as soon as possible?. Until recently though, the Gorkha leader had foiled the state government?s plans to hold the elections and forced it into giving the council?s term several extensions. It is easy to see why he has changed his position now. He has prevailed on New Delhi and Calcutta to give the council a special status under the sixth schedule of the Constitution. This means that Darjeeling will henceforth be treated as a tribal-majority area. Obviously, Mr Ghisingh is not too bothered about the fact that Nepalis never considered themselves tribals. Large numbers of them may actually resent this new identity for the community. But the new deal fits into Mr Ghisingh?s long-term political strategy. He sees it as a stepping stone to Darjeeling?s statehood in future. 

 Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has done well to avoid a confrontation with Mr Ghisingh. Peace in the hills has rightly been his first priority. Some of the leaders of his party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), were less astute when they pitched for a showdown with Mr Ghisingh. The Gorkha leader may have lost much of the popularity he enjoyed when he led an agitation for a separate Gorkhaland state in the mid-Eighties. But he still wields enough power to be able to set the hills on fire. For the CPI(M) and other political forces, the only way to challenge Mr Ghisingh is through the elections. The trouble is that he may change his mind yet again. The elections are unlikely to take place in the next few months. For the act that will place Darjeeling in the sixth schedule has to be passed by both houses of parliament. The state assembly too has to pass an enabling law in order to give effect to the Central legislation. But even the elections, as and when they are held, may bring the chief minister only a reprieve. It is certain that Mr Ghisingh will use any pretext to revive his demand for a separate state. Mr Bhattacharjee will then have no choice but to call his bluff.

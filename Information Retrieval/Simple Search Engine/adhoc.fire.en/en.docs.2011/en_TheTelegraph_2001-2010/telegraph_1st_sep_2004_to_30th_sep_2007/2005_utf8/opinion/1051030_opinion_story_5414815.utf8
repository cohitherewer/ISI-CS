 DIARY

 Speechifying is one of the occupational hazards of politics. But even so, Kamal Nath must have found that addressing the discerning crowd at the 70th anniversary of the Doon School Founder?s Day was very different from haranguing a gaggle of rural folk. It didn?t help that Doon was Nath?s alma mater. No wonder he went a bit gaga. Not only did he not stop at thanking his school for all his success, but he also turned to his old mathematics teacher, telling him that the theorems he had been taught helped him even now to plan his elections. His geography teacher came in for mention next, for having taught Nath the difference between Africa and America. A snide voice at the back added sotto voce that as the man responsible for navigating the country?s trade policy, he must still find the distinction very crucial. Affecting humility, Ol? Boy Roly (the name Nath earned at school as a chubby teenager) then turned to the audience and admitted sheepishly that though he was chief guest for the evening, he was neither the chief among those present, nor was he a guest since he had been coming back to Doon over the years, first as a parent and later as a member of the school board. But for someone so immersed in the traditions of the school, wasn?t it strange that he had forgotten to wear the school tie, although he had exchanged his trademark white kurta-pyjama for a business suit? The problem was solved when the principal, Kanti Bajpai, handed him his tie. Now that is what is called renewing old school ties. 

 Ghulam Nabi Azad is one reluctant chief minister-to-be. Perhaps he did not want to leave the political field wide open for his rivals in the capital, or he was afraid of what his wife would say, but Azad was chary of taking over the reins in Jammu and Kashmir. In Congress circles, Shamim Dev?s ?Noor Jehan-like effect? on her husband is quite a joke. But Azad needn?t have worried; his wife?s objections must have been allayed by the Padma Shri that she received last year in recognition of her contribution to Kashmiri music. Azad would have demurred even so, if he hadn?t been outmanoeuvred by Ambika Soni. Apparently, it was Soni who master-minded the clamour from state MLAs which led Sonia Gandhi to offer a one-year extension to Mufti Muhammad Sayeed. The latter refused and Azad was forced to go to Srinagar. Now the only way Azad can steal Soni?s thunder is by being a huge success in the hot seat. 

 If Jammu and Kashmir chief ministership is one hot seat in Indian politics, that of the BJP president is another. And since politicians rush in where more cautious souls fear to tread, there are no end of contenders for the latter job. For the RSS, which decides on such things, the race is down to three: Murli Manohar Joshi, Rajnath Singh and Sushma Swaraj. But things might not be that simple. The RSS is also debating the pros and cons of going in for the collective-leadership structure for the BJP, quite like what the RSS itself follows, with one sarsanghchalak-like president and two sarkarewah-like general secretaries. If only it were that easy to douse the fires of dissidence in the BJP!

 If you set aside the Congress, which, for the moment, is being forced to cohabit with the leftists, few national-level politicians can be heard singing praises of the communists. Which is why it was more than a little strange to hear the Uttar Pradesh governor, TV Rajeshwar, unqualifiedly laud the Indian communists, their contribution to the nation?s progress and the uplift of the poor. No mention of trade unionism or the left?s opposition to liberalization that every politician loves to portray as the one hurdle that may trip up the country. Even making allowance for the occasion ? Rajeshwar was speaking at the 91st birthday celebrations of Captain Laxmi Sehgal and is a self-professed admirer of the veteran freedom fighter and communist ? his speech raised quite a few eyebrows. Was he angling for a transfer to West Bengal?

 Politics is not for the feeble hearted. His confinement to a wheel chair, his son?s incarceration and a bleak political future haven?t broken Ajit Jogi. The man is unfazed as he goes about hosting iftaar parties, holding demonstrations in Raipur and taking on Margaret Alva, the party gen-sec in charge of Chhattisgarh. Even so, many were shocked at what they saw as his callous dismissal of his son?s stint in jail as something that would only brace him for future political battles. But then, they haven?t been to the school of hard knocks.

 Forever dismissed for their philistinism, Delhiites seem determined to redeem their reputation. For one thing, the favourite gift this festive season is not, as in earlier years, sweets or some mass-produced trinket from Indonesia or China. Delhiites are instead buying up Vikram Seth?s Two Lives, to establish their cultural credentials. Hopefully, if they?re buying it they must be reading it too. 

 The crowds at the week-long cultural festival at the India International Centre is another instance of the citizenry?s new-found love for culture-shulture. IIC has always had a reputation of being Delhi?s oasis of high culture, but it was quite unprecedented to see members and their guests throng in hundreds to listen to poetry readings, plays and musical events. So, was the well-laid dinner table, full of goodies from all over the country, meant to serve as the dessert that followed the feast for the eyes and ears? Or was it the main course?

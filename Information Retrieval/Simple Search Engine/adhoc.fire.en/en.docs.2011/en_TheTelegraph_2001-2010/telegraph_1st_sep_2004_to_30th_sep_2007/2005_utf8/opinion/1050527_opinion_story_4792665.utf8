 Letters to Editor

 Pearls for the swine

 Sir ? Clerks and peons in government offices are invariably rude, but that?s the least of their offences (?Good manners guide for group D?, May 25). I can think of several others ? corruption, inefficiency, obstructionism, laziness, stupidity and, even, sadism. Most of them don?t know the answers to simple queries, or if they do, they seem to take perverse pleasure in misleading. I have often wondered, out of a sense of tolerance born of long association with these petty babus, whether it is the sheer mindlessness of their jobs which makes them resort to toying with those who come to their offices. Just as a way to pass the time and amuse themselves. Instead of spending good money to teach manners to these inveterate boors, the government should arrange to give succour to those who are made to run from pillar to post as a result of their shenanigans. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Jagannath Sanyal, Calcutta

 Pat on the back

 Sir ? The performance of the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance in its first year in office has been mixed, with achievements far outweighing failures (?Manmohan?s Bharat: One year on?, May 22). Its most remarkable success lies in reducing communal tension in the country. The UPA has done well to move away from the divisive politics of its predecessor, the National Democratic Alliance. It was a quirk of fate that brought Manmohan Singh to the coveted chair. He never hankered after it. Nor has he shown any inclination to consolidate his position by cutting corners or cutting others down to size. He retains the same dignified detachment that he exemplified when the Congress president, Sonia Gandhi, handpicked him prime minister.

 Yours faithfully,

J.S. Acharya, Hyderabad

 Sir ? No amount of report cards or rankings are of any use to evaluate a prime minister or a government in a system that has totally failed. In our democracy, which puts so much emphasis on the quantitative and has no mechanism to judge qualitatively, people have no way to appreciate the lesser evil.

 Yours faithfully,

S.C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir ? The NDA is going to set a very bad precedent if it concentrates only on the failures of the UPA government in its first year in office (?BJP piles heat on Sonia sacrifice?, May 25). This is a reflection on the vulgar political culture of its veteran leaders like Atal Bihari Vajpayee, L.K. Advani and George Fernandes. Do the NDA leaders think they were cent per cent successful when they were in power? Even now, the NDA is failing to play the constructive opposition in parliament. Its continued boycott of parliament to pressurize the government to meet its demands does not augur well for democracy in India. It would thus be wise of the NDA to highlight both the successes and the failures of the UPA regime. True, the BJP is yet to accept ? or digest ? that the people of India threw them out of power. Vajpayee and Advani will just have to accept that the people of India were not swayed by their well-fabricated ?India Shining? campaign with its pointless squandering of crores of public money.

 Yours faithfully,

A. Ray Chaudhuri, Asansol

 Sir ? Manmohan Singh?s performance in this one year has been up to the mark given the policies he adopted and the challenges his government faced, particularly from the left. His government not only proved to be stable, but also put the economy on the growth path. One cannot dismiss him just because some provisions of the common minimum programme have not been realized.

 Yours faithfully,

Siddhartha Raj Guha, Jabalpur

 Unfair deal

 Sir ? It was amusing to see Asma Jahangir braving policemen to run for the cause of women?s participation in marathons in Pakistan (?Pak women writ runs ?, May 23). Far more heinous crimes than the denial of the right to participate in sporting activities are being committed against women in that country. Polygamy, the practice of burqa, and the medieval Hudood laws are only some of these. Unless Jahangir raises a voice against these evils, she will be seen as no better than any other publicity-seeker, simply interested in the right photo opportunity.

 Yours faithfully,

Rimli Dutta, Calcutta

 Sir ? Just few days ago there was a news report about how women will be allowed to fly F-16s, in Pakistan (?Ladies in Pak cockpit?, May 21). And a few days later came another report, ?Pak rape blow to Musharraf? (May 24), about the rape of two women by a policeman in Islamabad. Obviously, the more things change the more they remain the same. Pervez Musharraf may be planning to present a liberal image of Pakistan to the world, but somebody should tell him that if women can die for Pakistan (flying F-16s), then they can also run for Pakistan (in marathons). 

 Yours faithfully,

 Mousumi Sen, Calcutta

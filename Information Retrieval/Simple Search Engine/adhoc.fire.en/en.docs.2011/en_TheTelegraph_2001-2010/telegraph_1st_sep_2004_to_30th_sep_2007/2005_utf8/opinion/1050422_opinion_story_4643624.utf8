 Letters to Editor

 Who wants a tranquil life?

 Sir ? Poor Atal Bihari Vajpayee. As if being out of work was not enough, now the former prime minister has to contend with the idea of meditating with, and playing a doting dad to, the mercurial Uma Bharti (?Advice to Atal, suspense for the rest?, April 21). There?s no harm in mulling over one?s beti?s proposal though. Even if it is only because turning down Bharti is an onerous proposition, given the sadhvi?s foul temper and penchant for theatrics. But a tapasya could give the unemployed Vajpayee something to do with his time, besides helping him atone for turning a blind eye to certain atrocities during his time. But one suspects that Vajpayee will decline the invitation. After all, for a man used to being in the thick of things ? even if it means ruffling a few sangh feathers ? praying in some remote corner of Madhya Pradesh with the volatile sadhvi is hardly exciting.

 Yours faithfully,

 Shanti Mukherjee, Calcutta 

 New face for the job

 Sir ? Joseph Ratzinger, the new pope, is a man rich in spiritual passion, humility, self-denial and love for the cause of god and of man (?Orthodox high priest is pope?, April 20). As Pope Benedict XVI, he brings to the papacy a brilliant philosophical, and theological mind, personal holiness extended to the supreme sacrifice, missionary outreach combined with concern for unity ? the integration of spiritual charisma and institutional ministry. His episcopal motto, ?co-worker of the Truth?, has guided him in his tireless and uncompromising efforts aimed at defending and promoting the Catholic faith and its morals in an age in which the Catholic Church has suffered much persecution. The new pope has also worked to encourage studies aimed at increasing knowledge of the faith so that new problems arising from the progress of science and civilization can be answered in the light of the ?word of god?. Ratzinger has always striven to serve the truth, and to know it ever more thoroughly and to make it ever more widely known. The 115 cardinals of the Catholic world have made the right choice.

 Yours faithfully,

Paul Kokoski, Ontario, Canada

 Sir ? The Catholic church may have a new face in Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, or Pope Benedict XVI, but one hopes that the so-called progressive Catholics do not come to the forefront in the new chapter. Pope John Paul II exemplified the stabilizing strength and uncompromising integrity that a plenipotentiary of the largest religious community on earth must project to his co-labourers in the service. Surely Cardinal Ratzinger will try to follow in the steps of his immediate predecessor rather than don a ?progressive? look, which will only widen the gulf between god and the men who seek to serve him. He must not cater to whatever mores happen to be in vogue at the time, under the Trojan pretense of unity and reform. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Miguel A. Guanipa, Massachusetts, US

 Sir ? Before electing the German cardinal, Joseph Ratzinger, as the new pope, maybe the 114 cardinals should have paused to turn the pages of the history book. Ratzinger was an active member of Adolf Hitler?s youth brigade, and he even served as an airforce fighter during the Nazi regime. With this history, it is only to be expected that Jews won?t be on Pope Benedict XVI?s list of favourites. It is possible that he had played a vital role in the killing of the Jews in the Thirties and Forties. Given that Catholics have to live side by side with all other world religions, history should have been taken into consideration while electing the pope.

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? One of the biggest debates in the election of the pope was whether the new man should be conservative as prescribed by the ancient scriptures, or one who will be willing to move forward with the times. The difference between the former tendency and the latter is in the individual?s attitude to sex. A comparison between the philosophies of Hinduism and the Catholic religion may provoke some thinking on the subject. Here too, the key difference is in the attitude to sex. In Hindu philosophy, sex is associated with creation, hence the worship of the lingam, the sculptures and paintings in the temples and so on. On the other hand, in Catholic philosophy, sex is associated with sin, hence the idea of immaculate conception, the ban on the use of birth control devices and so on. 

 Yours faithfully,

N.B. Grant, Pune

 Sir ? The selection of Joseph Ratzinger as the new pope is hardly a surprise. He was close to the previous pope and is an orthodox. Here?s hoping that he continues from where Pope John Paul II has left, and makes significant contributions to the cause of world peace.

 Yours faithfully,

Avijit Singh, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir ? There?s a limit to which one can push one?s imagination. The idea of long-distance insemination via Cryo Bank, for couples who live apart or have no time for sex, is not even worth a laugh (?Making Babies, long-distance style?, April 12). Just one question: What happens when the offspring comes by? Who takes care of it, and how? Or is that taken care of by the long-distance method too?

 Yours faithfully,

Arta Mishra, Cuttack

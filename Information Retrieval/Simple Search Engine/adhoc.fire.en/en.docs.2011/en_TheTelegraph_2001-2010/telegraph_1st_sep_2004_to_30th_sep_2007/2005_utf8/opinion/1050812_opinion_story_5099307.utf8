 AMONG THE POWERFUL

 Sammy?s Hill, 

 By Kristin Gore, 

 Hutchinson ?10.99

 Every once in a while, a novel manages to get to the heart of the frisson between powerful men and ambitious women. Now and again a novel takes you into the cut and thrust of the world?s most powerful city ? Washington DC ? to take the lid off Capitol Hill; to become a tour de force. But this is not that kind of a novel.

 Emmy-nominated comedy-writer Kristin Gore is the daughter of Tipper and Al Gore, the former vice-president of the United States of America. She is highly suited to writing a tome about the shenanigans on Capitol Hill. And that is exactly what she has done.

 However, this is far from being a political thriller. Sammy?s Hill is an irreverent romp through the corridors of power. Risqu? and unconsciously hilarious, this is a novel that goes for your funny-bone. A bit like early Kurt Vonnegut Jr ? but from a neurotic female perspective.

 Our heroine works for the ambitious young senator, Robert Gary. And Sammy?s Hill is set in the high-stakes-world of an election-year Washington. But Samantha Joyce has a unique way of dealing with the dangers that lurk in the corridors of power.

 Samantha is also a bundle of nerves. What is she to do if a man-eating lion breaks free from the local zoo and runs amok in the city-streets? Or if she has lost her right arm in some god-forsaken accident? She can at best try to persuade her Japanese Fighting Fish to be more ?Zen?. All these preoccupations, however, do not necessarily prepare her for the seventy-hour working weeks, the late nights or the days in the spotlight where one mistake can mean a career calamity.

 Samantha is not exactly Julia Roberts, but she does have her love interests. Aaron Driver, a speech-writer working for a rival senator; Bob Espin, senior statesman, suave and distinguished; and Charlie Lawton, a hot-shot reporter for the Washington Post, with his boy-next-door charms and his bespectacled ?Clark Kent-ish eyes?.

 Kristin Gore?s humour is infectious. She writes in a tight, lucid style. Given her background, Gore negotiates the serpentine corridors of power well. And in Sammy?s Hill, she presents it all in a bright, colourful package ? laced with raunchy, neurotic humour.

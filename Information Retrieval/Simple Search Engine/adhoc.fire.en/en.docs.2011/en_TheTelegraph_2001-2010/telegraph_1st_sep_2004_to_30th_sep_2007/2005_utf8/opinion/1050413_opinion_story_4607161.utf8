 CHINA CALLING

 There is a growing warmth in the relations between India and China. The visit of the Chinese premier, Mr Wen Jiabao, has been an outstanding success. Nevertheless, it would be na?ve to assume that China will not present a strategic challenge to India, and New Delhi must, therefore, continue to prepare for this possibility. China has finally recognized Sikkim as a part of India, and the visiting premier handed over new, official maps showing the state as a part of Indian territory. Similarly, China has formally supported India?s candidature for a permanent seat in the United Nations security council. New Delhi and Beijing have also agreed to a set of political parameters and guiding principles to resolve the boundary dispute. In addition, the two countries reached an agreement on the modalities to implement confidence-building measures along the Line of Actual Control by improving contacts between the two militaries. 

 Trade ties between the two countries have also scaled unprecedented heights. In this context, a large number of agreements were signed and a report of the joint study group on trade and economic cooperation was made public. Caution, however, needs to be exercised even as relations with China continue to improve. From this perspective, there have been many warning signs already. By far the most serious concern is the China-Pakistan relationship and the help provided by Beijing to Islamabad?s nuclear programme. Beijing has clearly regarded a nuclear-armed Pakistan as a crucial regional ally and as a vital counterweight to India?s growing capabilities. While the movement on Sikkim is encouraging, Beijing?s refusal to recognize Arunachal Pradesh as a part of India, Chinese inroads into Myanmar, including the reported construction of a Chinese naval facility on the Coco islands, and Beijing?s recent overtures to the monarchy in Nepal should be of deep strategic concern to India. 

 The possibility of a future clash of interests between India and China over trade and influence in Asia should also not be wished away. It is thus the spirit of realpolitik rather than misguided notions of Hindi-Chini bhai bhai that must inform the relationship. Cooperation with China must, of course, be accelerated at all levels. But India must continue to expand cooperation with many of China ?s neighbours. This includes naval exercises in the South China Sea with Vietnam and other countries in the region, improved military ties with Singapore and other south-east Asian states and greater activism in Asian multilateral forums. The strategy must not be to position New Delhi explicitly as a counterweight to China, but to enlarge the space of Indian interests from the Malacca Straits to the Persian Gulf in order to emerge, potentially in the medium-term future, as a key balance to China.

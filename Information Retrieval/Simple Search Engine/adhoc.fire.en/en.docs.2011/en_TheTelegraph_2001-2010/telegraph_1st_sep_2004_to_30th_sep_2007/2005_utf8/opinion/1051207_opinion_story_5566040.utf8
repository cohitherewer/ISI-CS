 UMA?S DANCE

 The ideological distance the Bharatiya Janata Party has travelled between December 6, 1992 and December 6, 2005 is easily measured in terms of its attitude to Ms Uma Bharti. In 1992, in the period leading up to the destruction of the Babri Masjid and its aftermath, Ms Bharti was the party?s darling. She was at the forefront of those rabble-rousers who egged on the marauders to bring down the 16th century mosque. In 2005, she stands expelled from the primary membership of the BJP. There is some irony in the fact that indiscipline links Ms Bharti?s acme and her nadir. In 1992, she encouraged indiscipline to win laurels, in 2005, her own indiscipline earned her the ignominy of expulsion. Ms Bharti has the reputation of being a stormy petrel and has a track record of defiance, and these were considered to be major assets in a party which in the early Nineties had mass mobilization for protest and agitation at the top of its agenda. Within ten years, the BJP had begun to refashion itself as a responsible party of office which wanted to slough off its Hindu fundamentalist image. Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee began the process, and it was picked up by Mr L.K. Advani.

 There were two aspects to the process. One was the gradual transformation of an ideologically- driven party into a party of governance. The other was the nature of the transformation. It was a reform that travelled top down. It followed that the party leadership which pushed the transformation wanted an organization that was disciplined. Ms Bharti did not quite fit into this design. Before this round, there was an earlier exchange with Mr Advani when a compromise was worked out. This time round, she went a little too far in her defiance of the party leadership and its wishes. This provided a good excuse for the party to get rid of her since she had become irrelevant.

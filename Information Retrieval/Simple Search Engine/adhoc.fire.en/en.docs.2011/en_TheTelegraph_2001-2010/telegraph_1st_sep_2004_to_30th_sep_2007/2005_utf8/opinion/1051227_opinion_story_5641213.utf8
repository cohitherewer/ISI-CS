 CATCH THE NEW LOVE POLICE

 Malvika Singh

 How terrible and lout-like it was to see police officers slap, hit and pull the hair of innocent citizens who were together, romancing and being kind and loving to each other. The police officer from Meerut, who spoke to us on television said that his officers were not indulging in moral policing but trying to keep ?obscenity? at bay and wanted to stop ?eve teasing?. This same authority has never ever protected women and men on the streets of India, in buses and trains, or for that matter anywhere at all. Holding hands, embracing, kissing, showing and making love is not ?obscene? by any stretch of the imagination and the authority better start to understand that basic premise. When people love each other, happiness and peace prevail.

 What is truly obscene is when Indian men undo their fly, expose themselves and pee merrily against public and private property right across this country with the police looking on and often joining them. That is intrusive, unhygienic and unacceptable to women. The police should busy themselves in a drive to stop that particular obscene activity forthwith. They should imprison for life the many rapists who roam the streets instead of physically assaulting loving couples be they married or not, single men and women, men and men, women and women. Let us together kill this kind of hypocrisy, this strange and alien puritanical stance that seems to have invaded our traditional, liberal society. For a start, expel from service the cops who physically assaulted innocent men and women and compensate those attacked.

 In corrupt hands

 It is degrading to see an arm of the government behaving in an uncouth manner, flouting the law by hitting another bona fide citizen in full public view. It is against the law of this land to physically assault another. Why are those who are supposed to administer the law being encouraged to break it? Mr Prime Minister, where are you? Watching the channel beamed from Parliament House that transmits the proceedings, reflects, in no uncertain terms, the complete lack of intellectual depth on the many issues that plague India as well as the tardy and regressive manner in which elected representatives behave in the house. Somnath Chatterjee has to reprimand them constantly for reducing the dignity of parliamentary democracy. Thank the lord we have a fine and dignified speaker. Whenever a serious issue comes up for discussion, the members are at sea, indulging in silly rhetoric. Gurudas Dasgupta went on and on and finally had to be put down like an errant child in class. Small wonder they stall the functioning by protests and walkouts. They just do not seem to have the intellectual acumen to debate, discuss and break ground and enlarge their own stagnant minds with fresh initiatives that would help India move forward. 

 A manthan is on the verge of happening. Parliamentarians have been caught in the act of corruption, MCD officials have been exposed, the political and administrative nexus of large-scale corruption now stands fully revealed in the public arena. The unravelling of this all-encompassing web seems to have begun. Some honest people will also get caught as the corrupt run for cover, looking for stay orders and some more time to ?buy? whatever they need to, but in the end there is a glimmer of light, hope of a new beginning. The time is right as well. There is this new generation under the age of 40, which comprises at least 75 per cent of the population. It is this first truly post-independence generation that will discard the old ideologies, the social horrors that politicians and bureaucrats have nurtured to further themselves alone. It is time for this new energy to assert itself and throw out all the rot that has seeped into our environment, our life and living.

 A TRAVESTY OF JUSTICE

 Saddam Hussein?s trial is a media circus, guided by political interests rather than by a sense of legal integrity, writes N.J. Nanporia

 Lost case

 It is generally accepted that a victor?s justice is no justice, though the pretence that it is, pays a kind of tribute to those who come out on top. In that sense, nothing about the ongoing trial of Saddam Hussein should come as a surprise. Newspapers this month have been full of reports about Saddam having allegedly confessed to ordering the execution of Kurds. But the tone was set much earlier when Karl Rove, the American president?s much-favoured ideologue, declared that ?everything is measured by results, and the victor is always right.? To ensure that the victor is not deprived of his rights, a number of things have been done.

 First, Saddam was transferred to Iraqi legal custody ?in secret?, removing him from the protection of the Geneva Convention and, in particular, laying him open to the death penalty. George W. Bush had no qualms about voicing his opinion ? ?I think he ought to receive the ultimate penalty.? In keeping with this thought from the top man, a special tribunal was set up, equipped, as the Americans wanted, with the option of the death penalty.

 According to media reports, the Shia Iranis also wanted the death penalty. Perhaps they took their cue from the Americans. Even the Blair government redefined its position as ?not opposed to the death penalty?, brushing aside, in the process, the conventions of the European Court of Human Rights to which Britain and the European Union are signatories.

 It also endorsed the American view that the United Nations be kept at arm?s length. However, for form?s sake, the administration invited the UN ?to assist Iraqi judges and prosecutors? ? clearly anticipating a refusal. Kofi Annan ruled that ?UN officials should not be directly involved in extending assistance to any court or tribunal that is empowered to impose the death penalty.? He turned down the administration?s request for judges from the UN war crimes tribunal to train Iraqi judges, with a UN spokesman commenting that the Iraqi special tribunal failed ?to meet the minimum standards of justice.?

 Second, having set up the special tribunal and confirmed that the idea was to condemn Saddam to death, it was necessary to ensure this outcome. To this end, 42 Iraqi would-be judges were given an eight-days? training ?in international law?. Consider this. Here are the makings of one of the most crucial trials since the end of World War II, and the judges have to be hurriedly ?trained? in international law. This is ludicrous. That it hasn?t reduced the world to helpless laughter is perhaps due to the unapologetic blatancy of the whole thing. To close every possible loophole, the Iraqi and American lawyers have drafted a law that ?allows for certain trial sessions to be held out of the public eye.?

 Third, for obvious reasons, due attention must be given to the nature of the evidence. So an American attorney, appointed by the US justice department, was assigned the task of ?coordinating? it. In her role as National Security Advisor, Condoleezza Rice had, early on, laid the foundations of this coordination by directing the ?government to take the initiative in preparing the case against Hussein that will ultimately be run by the Iraqis.? No wonder, there is derisive laughter at the special tribunal?s claim that the ?IST is an independent court? and the ?Americans have nothing to do with it.?

 Is there in all this the slightest trace of ?presumption of innocence?, which is fundamental to justice as it is usually understood? Will witnesses be called and if they are, will they have ?intimate knowledge? of the deals between the United States of America and the former Ba?athist regime, from which both gained substantially. That, among other things, was the basis for Saddam?s absolute rule for more than two decades. In fact, the defence would hardly be accused of exaggeration if it argued that the US was involved in many of the things Saddam is accused of. However unconcerned the neoconservatives might appear, the near certainty of embarrassing disclosures of the past in a highly publicized court trial is something they would want to avoid. 

 The Iraqi ex-offshore patriots who now represent ?sovereign? Iraq are eager for an early and quick trial for internal political reasons and have accused the Americans of ?hindering the Iraqi investigations of Saddam Hussein? because ?there are lots of secrets they want to hide.? The problem of how to get round this difficulty hasn?t been solved. Nor the difficulty of finding documentary evidence other than reports that are either inconclusive or favour the defence. 

 During the period when, according to the Americans, Saddam was allegedly using poison gas, Donald Rumsfeld was in Baghdad almost every day, normalizing, even cementing, US-Iraqi relations. Some evidence, moreover, suggests that the Iranians rather than the Iraqis were guilty of using gas during the Iran-Iraq war. Further reinforcement of this conclusion has been provided by the Central Intelligence Agency in March 1988, when the Halabja gassing against the Kurds took place. 

 There are also question-marks over the 1990 Kuwait invasion and the role played by the then US ambassador in Baghdad, April Glespie, who famously said that George Bush (Sr) ?wanted better and deeper relations? with Saddam?s Iraq, and in effect signalled Saddam to move against Kuwait. Yet 15 years later, Condoleezza Rice cites the alleged gas attack and the Kuwait invasion as justifying the regime change in Iraq. The documentation for the above seems to be quite substantial but a well-tutored Iraqi special tribunal can perhaps be depended upon to rule against its use. Which is why the Iraqis or the ruling Shiites now have a common cause with the Americans in ensuring that Saddam?s defence team does not include foreign legal experts.

 If there is even an approximation of a fair trial, the Iraqi prosecutors, and through them the Americans, will be on a sticky wicket. But the intention plainly is to stage political theatre, a global media event dominated by political interests rather then by a sense of legal integrity. What is unfolding is a programmed happening, predetermined to the last detail to yield an outcome that is guaranteed. And if despite America?s back-seat driving something goes wrong, the ?sovereign? Iraqi government will take the blame. If it goes right the neo-conservatives will, as they see it, be vindicated.

 The preliminary ground-work was launched when humiliating TV images of Saddam were released to destroy, as the Americans put it, the myth of the Iraqi leader as ?superman or God?. This sort of thing has conditioned global perception of the man as one whose fate has been decreed, not least by Bush who long ago declared Saddam to be a ?killer?, a ?thug?. Judged by informal standards which, tragically, are the only kind we now have, Saddam was no doubt a monster and should be condemned as such. But to subject him to this mockery of a trial is to legitimize what has been called Guantanamo justice. And although the Muslim world has good reason to know what Saddam was, this is how it will continue to see it.

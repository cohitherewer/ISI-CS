 A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE

 The global situation has changed too much for any revival of the ?Bandung spirit? to be possible, writes Chandrashekhar Dasgupta

 Picture perfect

 In diplomacy as in matrimony, anniversaries tend to evoke rose-tinted recollections of past events. Memories of the Afro-Asian conference held in Bandung in April 1955 will be briefly revived during its golden jubilee observance. Indonesia and South Africa have sent out invitations to a new Afro-Asian summit timed to coincide with the anniversary. Protestations of the continuing relevance of Bandung will doubtless issue from the gathering. This theme will be echoed in officially sponsored scholarly gatherings in the third world, reviving old myths and creating new ones.

 A prevalent myth in India is that the Bandung conference was the inspiration of Jawaharlal Nehru. So deep-seated is the myth that even C.S. Jha who, as joint secretary in the ministry of external affairs, was responsible for the preparatory work for the conference, came to subscribe to it in later years. Jha, who later rose to the position of foreign secretary, asserts in his memoirs, From Bandung to Tashkent, that Nehru was the ?prime mover? who persuaded the other co-sponsors to ?fall in with the idea?. Yet the historical records prove beyond doubt that the initiative for the conference was taken by Indonesia. Nehru himself made clear the origins of the proposal. He wrote: ?At the Conference of Prime Ministers held in Colombo (in 1954), the Prime Minister of Indonesia put forward a proposal to hold an Afro-Asian Conference. This proposal was generally approved, but it was pointed out that this required a great deal of preparation.? 

 Nehru?s initial reaction to the proposal was a qualified endorsement. He said that he was attracted to the idea but foresaw several difficulties. It would be difficult to reach an agreement on important issues because of the wide differences of opinion between the participants. Nehru had himself taken the initiative to hold the Asian conference in New Delhi in 1949. What explains his initial reservations on the Indonesian proposal? The answer lies in the changes in Asia between 1949 and 1964. With the birth of the People?s Republic of China, the Korean war and the first India-China war, the Cold War had arrived in Asia. The groundwork had been laid for the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Baghdad Pact, while China had allied itself to the Soviet Union. No wonder, Nehru foresaw problems in arriving at a consensus between countries with such divergent views.

 Major hurdles had to be overcome even in finalizing the list of invitees to the conference. The most contentious question related to China. India and Burma were strongly in favour of inviting China, while Pakistan and Ceylon were opposed. Pakistan, which maintained diplomatic relations with Beijing, explained that it had no objections in principle but, as a matter of practical policy, it was of the opinion that China should not be invited. It was Prime Minister U. Nu of Burma who finally brought the debate to an end by threatening to stay away unless China was invited. 

 At the Bandung conference, widely divergent views were aired even on such basic issues as colonialism and peaceful co-existence. Ceylon, supported by Pakistan, Turkey, Iraq and the Philippines, insisted that the ?satellite? states of east Europe were colonies of a new kind, a proposition to which China strongly objected. The five principles of peaceful co-existence propounded by China, India and Burma were seen by some countries that had allied themselves to the West as a communist ploy to lull the ?free world?. Thus, Pakistan, Turkey and Iraq argued that peace could not be maintained in the absence of collective defence arrangements. Pakistan proposed that the five principles be supplemented by two more, namely, the principle of self-defence, including collective defence; and the principle of settlement of all disputes by negotiation or arbitration. These controversies led to a deadlock and, at one stage, the conference seemed doomed to failure.

 It was rescued only by skilful drafting designed to paper over the cracks in ?solidarity?. The final communiqu? denounced ?colonialism in all its manifestations?, a formulation interpreted in the West as covering communist neo-colonialism and by China as referring to the political, economic, cultural and other facets of colonialism. The five principles were expanded to incorporate a further five, including those proposed by Pakistan. Unversed in the art of reading between the lines of diplomatese, the public in Asia and Africa widely hailed the outcome as an expression of Afro-Asian solidarity. Nehru?s more qualified verdict was that ?taking an overall view of the picture?the Conference was a remarkable success?.

 In the decade after Bandung, sharp differences appeared between major Asian states. Sino-Indian relations deteriorated fast, culminating in the border conflict of 1962. Pakistan went to war with India over Kashmir in 1965 and sought a new strategic partnership with China. Indonesia embarked on a policy of confrontation with Malaysia and Singapore.

 Thus little was left of the celebrated ?Bandung spirit? when, a decade later, Indonesia issued the call for a second Afro-Asian conference. The call was issued in consultation only with China and Pakistan, and the preparatory meetings gave ample evidence of the intention of these three countries to hijack the planned summit. India responded by proposing that the Soviet Union and Malaysia be invited too. The proposal was strongly opposed by China and Indonesia, resulting in a deadlock. A further complication arose shortly before the summit when a military coup was staged in its venue, Algiers. Thrown into confusion, the preparatory ministerial meeting decided to postpone the summit and the proposal went into hibernation.

 The golden anniversary summit has as its objective the revival of the ?Bandung spirit? and the creation of a new strategic partnership between Asia and Africa. What can this amount to, in practical terms? The international situation today is very different from that of 1955. A single superpower dominates the scene. There is no longer a rival countervailing power to which the Afro-Asian states can look for support if they pursue policies opposed by the sole superpower. Relations with the United States of America are of primary importance to every country in Asia and Africa and it is difficult to envisage a situation in which any country would rush to the support of another at the cost of its ties with Washington. The only attractive areas of cooperation are those that do not entail conflict with the US. The most promising of these lie in the domain of economic issues ? questions relating to the global trading system, investment flows, intellectual property rights and sustainable development. The Afro-Asian summit would be well advised to focus on these areas. It is unlikely that new ideas will emerge from the summit since these issues are already under consideration in existing forums such as the group of 77 and the non-aligned movement. Nevertheless, reiteration of G-77 and NAM positions serve a purpose. For the rest, the summit will have to be content with a brief and flickering revival of the ?Bandung spirit?.

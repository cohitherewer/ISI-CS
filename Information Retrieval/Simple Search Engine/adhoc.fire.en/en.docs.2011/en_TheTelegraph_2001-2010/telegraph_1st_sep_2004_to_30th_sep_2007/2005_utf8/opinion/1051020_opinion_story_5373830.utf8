 LAWLESS GAME

 The arm of the law is not always long. Nor are all men equal before the law in Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s Bengal. That perhaps is why Mr Narayan Biswas, a minister evading the law, can attend his office at the Writers? Buildings, which also has the offices of the chief minister and the state?s police chief. The director-general of police, Mr S.C. Avasthy, sounded bizarre when he said he had ?no idea? why the minister had not been arrested. This despite the home secretary, Mr Prasad Ranjan Roy, confirming that Mr Biswas?s name figured in the list of sixty to seventy thousand people ?absconding for more than six months?. The most shocking, however, is the chief minister?s silence. The government?s inaction can only mean that leaders and workers of the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) can commit crimes with impunity. It must be damning evidence of the partisan ways of the police and administration in Bengal. And it makes a mockery of the chief minister?s claim of transparent and impartial rule. This may not be the first ? or the last ? example of a blatant violation of law and political morality. But Mr Biswas?s case is the most glaring example so far of the CPI(M)?s subversion of the rule of law. 

 The Biswas episode has a larger context. It shows the deeper malaise of a political system that condones crimes in the name of politics. Worse, the people have come to accept this as a reality from which there is no escape. All parties cynically exploit this sense of helplessness and see no reason to change their ways. Mr Biswas?s case shows once again how hollow the left?s high moral ground actually is. After this episode, Mr Bhattacharjee and his party would have no moral right to accuse someone like Mr Adhir Choudhury of the Congress of using criminal methods for political gains. The government?s role in Mr Biswas?s case confirms what a senior police officer, Mr Nazrul Islam, said about the police in Bengal serving their political masters. The least the chief minister can do is remove Mr Biswas from his cabinet. But he can redeem his political credibility only by allowing the law to catch up with the minister.

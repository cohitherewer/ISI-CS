 WALKING THE ROAD BLINDFOLDED

 SHOT IN THE DARK

 Are students aware of where they are being led?

 The Jadavpur University impasse raises some fundamental questions about present day student politics in India. Our freedom movement saw widespread student participation; students led the opposition movement during the Emergency. Then there was the unforgettable Naxal movement when thousands of bright students gave up their future to chase a Utopia. 

 That idealism has vanished. Student movement has now become synonymous with violence. Nowadays, one needs to have a criminal record to qualify as a student leader in many universities in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Widespread violence, even murder, is not uncommon during student elections in these universities. 

 Delhi University elections, however, are special since the candidates in the fray are generally children or relatives of the capital?s political heavyweights, and money and freebies are distributed generously during election campaigns. Even before the elections are over, rival groups (often National Students Union of India and the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad) start accusing each other. Even a usually peaceful JNU witnesses sporadic disturbances during student elections. In fact, last year, on election day, the ABVP went on a rampage following its disagreement with other student organizations on the voting process. 

 In West Bengal, student violence took an ugly turn recently when some alleged members of the Students Federation of India lynched a schoolboy in Siliguri when he refused to participate in a strike sponsored by the outfit. When a Left Front minister criticized its behaviour, the SFI, instead of apologizing for the incident, demanded an explanation from him. The Rajasthan high court has banned students? union elections in all educational institutions in the state. While reading out the verdict, the judges expressed concern over the decline of academic standards in the campus.

 It is painful to find that politicking has become the norm for contemporary student movements. Who do we blame for this? The students? The administrators? The education system? Or society in general?

 According to popular perception, student politics is a waste of time. It is corrupt and hence breeds instability. The reasons for this are not difficult to find. Student politics is supposed to address issues concerning students. It is also expected to mirror the hopes and aspirations of the student community. Yet, today it is only a breeding ground for opportunistic leaders. It is from here that major political parties recruit their cadre. 

 Each political party tries to indoctrinate the youth in their own ideology. For this, they patronize certain student organizations. These student organs try to manipulate student politics in such a manner that it benefits the parent parties. Take the case of the ABVP. It was found sloganeering outside the Vigyan Bhawan in Delhi, protesting against the human resource development minister?s so-called attempts to ?de-saffronize? education, typically on the lines of the sangh parivar.

 But this political indoctrination from below cannot be separated from that which occurs from above. Today it is well known that all major appointments to the universities of Bengal are politically-motivated. 

 The attempts of ruling parties to infiltrate educational institutions have become such a big headache that a few months back, the former HRD minister, Murli Manohar Joshi, himself suggested the inclusion of retired Supreme Court judges in committees that would recommend to the president names of candidates for the post of vice-Chancellor in Central universities.

 In all this, the student and his concerns are completely lost. Whenever independent voices try to get themselves heard, as in Siliguri and Jadavpur, they are brutally suppressed. Are the students themselves aware of where such dubious politics is leading them?

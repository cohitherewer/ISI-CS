The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letters to Editor

 Snubbed most royally

 Sir ? Is it too much of a coincidence that the Nepal monarch arrested Sher Bahadur Deuba only hours after India, under left pressure, went back on its word to resume arms supply to Nepal (?Delhi bares Nepal fangs?, April 29)? The Nepal monarch has merely shown India who calls the shots, so let?s not call it a ?slap?, it is just a royal snub. In the meantime, let our leftist friends realize that in their quest to hammer the king into submission, they are actually paving the way for thousands of Nepali refugees to flood india, and thereby creating a security mess.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sanwar Alam, Calcutta

 Show time, folks

 Sir ? The picture, ?Sabya then, Shahzad now? (April 24) on the front page of The Telegraph, of Shahzad Kalim sporting his creations, came as a surprise. There were other more important news on the page which could have done with a photograph. But obviously a young male designer surrounded by skimpily-dressed models proved to be more colourful and attractive than the rest. And it is the ?eye-catching? quality that matters today if the paper is to grab the attention of those who do not usually read it. The day being a Sunday, one can assume, The Telegraph had to put up with more competition than on the weekdays. Yet the rules of the game do shock. The paper may be out to find potential customers with these attractions, but should it entirely forget the fact that there are also younger readers who could do without such visuals? 

 Yours faithfully,

Rimli Datta, Calcutta

 Sir ? At first glance the picture of Shahzad Kalim and the models appeared to be on the front page by mistake instead of page three. My attention then shifted to what Kalim was wearing and what he had forced on his models. The colours were so intense that I do not think Kalim left out any shade of the rainbow. There were ribbons hanging out, and skirts in tatters. I wondered if any of the models would walk 500 metres on a busy thoroughfare wearing the same dresses even if they were paid double the amount they had received for walking the ramp. 

 I believe real fashion is that which becomes a craze among the common people. And the creations displayed at the Lakme India Fashion Week are not for them. Yet each of them may cost Rs 10,000 to Rs 50,000. A mere 10 per cent of this will go for the material and labour cost, the remainder to the fashion designer. 

 The vested interest of the designers makes them form a syndicate of sorts ? they praise each other, clap and show camaraderie because they know that the money, running into crores of rupees, will be shared among only 10 or 12 of them. That is probably why Ritu Kumar requested her competitors to participate this time and ?encourage? the fashion industry.

 Yours faithfully, 

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

 Sir ? How relevant are fashion shows to present-day society (?Hint of spice amp; breath of ice in last call?, April 28)? Fashion designers have created a fairy-tale world of their own ? a world that does not touch the lives of ordinary people. They unanimously declare the ?colours of the season? and cull out fashion statements. They design for ?fall/winter? to ?spring/summer?, but not for real people. After all, how many of their creations are ?wearable?, both in terms of affordability and pragmatism? Indulging in this genre of fashion is only a diversion for the rich and famous. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bedashruti Mitra, Raigarh

 Sir ? Is Shahzad Kalim any different from Sabyasachi Mukherjee?

 Yours faithfully,

M. Chatterjee, Calcutta

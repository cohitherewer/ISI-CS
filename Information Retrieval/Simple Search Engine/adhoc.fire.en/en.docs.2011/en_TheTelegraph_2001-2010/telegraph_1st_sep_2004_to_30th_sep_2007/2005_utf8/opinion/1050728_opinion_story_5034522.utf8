 RESTORE WITH HAMMER AND TONGUES

 Laldighi, and not Dalhousie Square, should be the motif for the new restoration work being planned by the state government, writes Barun De

 Touch-up job

 Recent discussions on inner Calcutta?s central business district have focussed on two keywords ? ?Dalhousie Square? and ?heritage? ? without any firm policy decision on what is to be done. Urban re-use of the monumental buildings around the square tank, close to the River Hooghly, and removal of the impediments of buildings, garages and bus shelters would certainly reaffirm faith in a city, now developing another north-south axis from Rajarhat to Garia.

 But heritage is not only static conservation. Purposeful contemporary re-use and regular maintenance are necessary. For heritage does not mean only antique, quaint, or beautiful buildings. It also means open space, as scale and perspective ? neither shutting out the sky and light, nor a concrete jungle. In nomenclature, it should be comprehensible to the common man as well as evocative of the past. 

 In the 21st century, it is not enough to harp on reviving a logo which did not last in Calcutta?s imagination for even one out of its three centuries. When the East India Company established Fort William, where the GPO and the Treasury Building now stand, the central focus was Laldighi. According to some legends, the place took its name from the Doljatra celebrations around the Sabarna Chaudhuris? kacharibari. Others attribute it to the flowering Gulmohar trees later planted around the tank. 

 For a century, it was called ?the great tank?. Lord Dalhousie became governor-general from 1848 (when he began to destroy the residual Indian independence by forcing the second Anglo-Sikh war on a defeated Punjabi ruling class through the Doctrine of Lapse, which had dispossessed many more royals) till 1856. By this time his measures, military, civil and evangelical, had sown the seeds of hate that flared up in 1857. A colonialist ruling class commemorated imperial expansion by officially renaming what even my generation, which grew up before independence, still knew as Laldighi.

 In the early Thirties, Writers? Buildings was attacked by three revolutionary militants, who ran through the corridor to gun down an IG of Prisons. Their names were commemorated in a second-round renaming of the square. In the early Forties, I recall coming by taxi with my mother from Howrah across the collapsible pontoon bridge that still spanned the river. We were diverted from Clive Street since students were agitating to break the Holwell Monument that used to stand between the Writers? rotunda and the present Eastern Railway headquarters (it is now tucked away in St John?s Churchyard). This was Subhas Chandra Bose?s last agitation in India for freedom before he was taken into custody, after which he disappeared abroad. Dalhousie had already receded from the national imagination and become just a mnemonic, a memory tool.

 From the Square?s late imperial architectural style, like Paris, Vienna or Sankt Petersburg, ran streets housing the managing agency houses of economic colonialism. Gladstone Lyall, Bird amp; Co., the Allahabad Bank, Williamson Magor, Duncan Bros., Shaw Wallace ? each spread from their buildings, tentacles into the Bay of Bengal hinterland to pull out economic resources such as jute, coal and tea. River and ocean shipping companies run by firms like Macneill and Barry, or Mackinnon Mackenzie, transported them to British world markets, with no profit accruing to the local rural masses. Banks ? Thomas Cook, Grindlays, Standard Chartered, American Express ? handled these imperialist operations for Western super profits. The most awe-inspiring view of this economic and political milieu was from the Government House (now Raj Bhavan) steps, through the road between its carriage stables, to the tank and the central fa?ade of Writers Buildings. Its auxiliaries were the two roads on either flank housing some of the most important mansions and offices of an imperial ruling class ? in particular its postal, telegraphic, railway and judicial system.

 World War II left old Calcutta raddled, by bomb scare, influx of refugees from Burma, the starving country folk during the famine and the removal of the military headquarters, first to Ranchi and then to Kandy in Ceylon. The August 1946 mob slaughter, the callous irrationality of the 1947 Partition, the refugee inflow that swelled from 1942 to the Fifties and the growing Bengali political radicalization, along with the failure of the managing agency system ? all obscured the messy government steps from the Fifties to the Seventies to de-sacralize the imperial content of the locality.

 A ghastly Telephone Bhavan wrecked Dalhousie Square. The beautiful Eden Gardens riverfront whittled away as a fairground came up under B.C. Roy?s aegis. This was compounded later by unsightly country-bus stands. Not only were people who were shot or hanged for terrorism recalled in the official renaming, their names were abbreviated in Bengali as ?Bi Ba Di?, meaning ?contestant?. British business migrated to greener pastures, leaving the bhadralok high and dry. The great imperial offices had earlier been transferred to New Delhi. All this reflected the drying up of the deltas of the Bay of Bengal and the collapse of an economy based on certain agricultural crops and a few mines. To add to this was the collapse of the industrial system between Howrah and Asansol. Dalhousie Square no more had economic, social or political base.

 Governance in West Bengal now has a new look. A certain confidence in the political elite is being expressed through the new buildings, new urban promotion programmes, and the growth in information technology and services sectors. This may have brought some vitality to the earlier moribund banks around the tank square. The old, established multinational banks are now competitively in the forefront of Calcutta?s heritage movement ? American Express has made a grant through the World Monument Fund for the restoration planning of what is called the ?Dalhousie Square?.

 New civic amenities for the region from Brabourne Road (now renamed) upto Curzon Park (also renamed) are being mooted. Local agencies set up to handle such funds are using the name of a British imperialist as a logo in these days of globalizing ?world history?. If they speak of Binay, Badal and Dinesh or Trailokya Maharaj (who spent many years in the Andamans and has replaced Lord Brabourne) or whoever has replaced Curzon in the park?s name, they risk being asked by a present generation, not too interested in nationalist history, about the identities of these men. Thus, Dalhousie?s ghost has been resurrected.

 What the detailed programme will be, what the government of West Bengal and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation propose to do, and how the major stakeholders (that is, those who own the properties of the inner business district) react, how the financial sponsorship (without which the initial grants will be meaningless) will be worked out are things only the future will tell. A small plea, before the planning takes shape. Change the logo to a more local, more indigenous wording, closer to the common tongue of the pedestrians who mill around the area, morning and evening. 

 In an inaugural meeting a few days ago, the governor of the state pointed out that imperial effigies were best kept at rest in the Flagstaff House in Barrackpur. What deserves restoration is the work of the Indian craftsmen who designed and chiselled the architecture of the magnificent old buildings. Let us start by making Laldighi the logo for this cooperative venture.

 Letters to Editor

 Hell hole

 Sir ? Open manholes and reckless driving have made Calcutta?s roads virtual death-traps. Yet another life was lost because a manhole was lying uncovered, right beside the city?s showpiece patch of green, the Maidan (?Maidan manhole death?, Dec 1). Manhole covers are frequently stolen, most often by drug addicts who sell them off for their daily dose of heroine or cocaine. And then, temporary covers made of substandard concrete slabs are casually placed over the holes. Sometimes, when even slabs are not available, a bamboo stick or a branch is stuck into the manhole to alert pedestrians and vehicles. Are the manholes there to provide a living for thieves and corrupt contractors and officials? Unless the theft of covers can be checked, along with adequate repairs, particularly after the indiscriminate digging of roads, it will be difficult to stop the tragic deaths. But all of this must be already known to councillors and mayors. And yet, they refuse to act, even though the current mayor has himself been a victim of Calcutta?s treacherous roads.

 Yours faithfully,

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? If pedestrians with all their sense organs functioning can slip into open manholes and die with such alarming regularity, one dreads to even imagine how the blind negotiate Calcutta?s roads. It appears that the citizens of this metropolis are destined to live their lives at the mercy of either killer vehicles or incompetent corporation officials who cannot even ensure that manholes stay covered.

 Yours faithfully,

L. Rajiv, Calcutta

 Sir ? The incident of a manhole claiming a life is not likely to cause a ripple in Calcutta?s record of accidents. What is disconcerting is the complete and perpetual lack of initiative on the part of authorities (whether it is Calcutta police or Calcutta Municipal Corporation) to prevent such mishaps. The officials of the two organizations only seem to wake up after a fatal incident has taken place, and the press and people are baying for their blood. Instead of passing the buck, the police, corporation and ordinary citizens should come together to prevent such accidents. The police should track down the thieves who steal the manhole-covers, while the CMC should ensure the proper maintenance of the manholes. The local residents must alert the police and the CMC in case of theft or negligent maintenance.

 Yours faithfully,

Rajrupa Banerjee, Calcutta

 Changed script

 Sir ? Saif Ali Khan has certainly set an example by refusing to run away with his car after he hit a child on the road. He not only carried the injured child to the hospital, but also called on him later and pledged to bear all the hospital expenses. This incident more than compensates for his alleged misbehaviour with journalists (?Saif lesson for senior?, Dec 11). Filmstars and celebrities of our country should take a lesson from Saif. In France, drivers responsible for any accident are legally bound to take adequate care of the victim. There should be a similar legislation in our country.

 Yours faithfully,

P.K. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? I had been a fan of Saif Ali Khan?s acting, but I must say that he has won my respect as a human being too. Saif?s behaviour is all the more praiseworthy since we know how his co-actor, Salman Khan, behaved under similar circumstances a few years back. Even Saif?s father, Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi, behaved irresponsibly when he went into hiding after being caught red-handed with the carcasses of some endangered animals. In both cases, the accused failed to surrender immediately, thus tarnishing their public image. It is good to know that there are some people who are not afraid to face the consequences. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arindam Basu, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir ? I recently flew Air India from New York to Calcutta with a change of plane in Mumbai. While my flight from New York to Mumbai was delayed, I was able to catch my connection Air India flight that eventually brought me to Calcutta in the wee hours of the day. Not unexpectedly ? since there was little time left in Mumbai to transfer to my Calcutta flight ? none of my two checked-in suitcases reached Calcutta with me in the same plane. However, I expected that the suitcases would be brought to Calcutta by the morning flight next day from Mumbai. When I went to the Air India luggage office at the Dum Dum airport next day, a pleasant lady informed me that indeed, my suitcases had been traced to Mumbai airport. However, she also indicated that I should not expect to have these suitcases until at least three days later. Her explanation: Air India flies only twice each week between Mumbai and Calcutta, and all other airlines, including Indian Airlines, which have several flights daily between Mumbai and Calcutta, refuse to carry delayed international luggage. I was also told that had my connecting flight been from Delhi instead of Mumbai, there would have been no problem, since only the Mumbai Indian Airlines refuse to carry other passengers? suitcases. 

 On the few earlier occasions that I have lost my luggage on international travel, the airlines have always been apologetic, besides offering to purchase locally all items necessary for my personal use until my missing bags arrived. Air India refuses to offer anything more than Rs 3,000, a cruel joke in the modern days of air travel. When will our national airline provide customer service on par with other international airlines?

 Yours faithfully,

Kunal Saha, Columbus, US

 FOR ART?S SAKE

 The Supreme Court must be the most overworked institution in the country. From emissions to examinations, it has to keep a stern eye on almost every aspect of Indian life. Another matter has now been added to its lengthening list of vigils ? art theft. The nation is losing its Nobels and Buddhas to thieves and smugglers. So a distressed Indian has filed a public interest litigation in response to which the apex court has issued a notice to the Centre. The government has eight weeks to respond to this concerned citizen?s idea that there should be a special force formed, which would protect the nation?s art treasures. This force should be trained on a mix of the fine and the martial arts. One imagines ubiquitous Spidermen who have read Stella Kramrisch. This litigant has also asked for a Central list of art objects, to be checked regularly. (The Indian Museum in Calcutta apparently has a lone man who is officially required to count tens of thousands of priceless objects at the end of each working day.)

 Archaeological and art-historical scholarship alone will not save India?s treasures. Nor would the formation of yet another body of ?experts?. If they could, then things would not have come to this in the first place. A great deal of museology is pure science and technology, and has very little to do with refinement, bureaucracy and aesthetics. Curatorship, preservation, restoration and museum security are technical skills that need specialized and state-of-the-art equipment and training. Proper funding, know-how and management are essential to acquiring and maintaining these. Each museum, gallery, institute or archive will have to create an infrastructure for such skills. Private and public money will have to be arranged for, and universities or other educational institutions urged to teach these sciences. Architects and designers, together with highly skilled technicians, will have to be engaged to create security systems and regimes. The running of these things will have to be divested of red tape, hierarchy and systemic rot and corruption to create a work ethic that would be alert, accountable and up-to-date. This is not a question of martial might or an aesthetic sensibility. Committees, meetings and erudition will only hinder it. Besides, guarding the nation?s borders, railways and politicians is not the same as looking after its cultural artefacts.

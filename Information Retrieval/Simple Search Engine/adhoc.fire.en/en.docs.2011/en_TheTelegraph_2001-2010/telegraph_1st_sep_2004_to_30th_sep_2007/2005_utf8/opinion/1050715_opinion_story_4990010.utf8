 ROBOTS IN BATTLE

 Thing of the past

 The Information Revolution in Military Affairs in Asia Edited by Emily O. Goldman and Thomas G. Mahnken, Palgrave, ? 45

 The next war will probably be fought with computers along the information highways. Computer viruses and electronic logic bombs, rather than planes and tanks, will be the principal weapons of future war. This is because of the beginning of information revolution in military affairs. The ten essays in the book analyze the transformation taking place in the militaries of Asia.

 Revolutions in military affairs means a quantum jump in military power. The RMA of the early modern era witnessed the replacement of feudal cavalry with gunpowder armies of the nation states. The RMA of the late Thirties was the product of internal combustion engines which in turn gave rise to panzer warfare. The recent RMA have been possible due to the replacement of industrial economies with information-based economies in the advanced countries.

 At present, the United States of America is the principal driver of the RMA. But it is not necessary that the situation will always remain so. Ironically, as Mahnken points out, it was the Soviets who, towards the end of the Cold War, became aware of the major change in the nature of conventional warfare. The Americans knew about it from the writings of Soviet theoriticians. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the US armed forces became the model around the world. However, the pattern of diffusion of RMA varies from country to country.

 Taiwan is at the forefront of the RMA. This is possible because the island?s economy is booming and it is a world leader in IT. The principal drivers of RMA are the dual-use technologies produced by the commercial sector and the civilian leaders who are proponents of information warfare, in contrast to the hidebound military officers. James Mulvenon writes that Taiwan is the leading expert in manufacturing computer viruses. In case of a stand-off with Beijing, Taipei will launch massive attack waves of computer viruses to destroy mainland China?s information network.

 From 1999, Australia is also trying to play a greater role in south-east Asia. Michael Evans claims that in the Australian Defence Force?s doctrine, knowledge superiority over the enemy is more important than achieving firepower superiority. 

 Since China?s neighbours are shaping their forces in accordance with the RMA, Mao?s military is also rattled. You Ji writes that the RMA?s emphasis on gaining information about the enemy sits well with China?s traditional military culture of ?knowing the enemy?. Acquisition of military satellites and miniaturized super computers are high on the PLA?s agenda. However, there is a problem. Most of the Chinese soldiers, being semi-literate peasants, are incapable of handling the Global Positioning System.

 It is too early to say whether wars of the new millennium will be fought in automated battlefields by robots and battle drones. But the book makes us aware that we are living in an age of military transition.

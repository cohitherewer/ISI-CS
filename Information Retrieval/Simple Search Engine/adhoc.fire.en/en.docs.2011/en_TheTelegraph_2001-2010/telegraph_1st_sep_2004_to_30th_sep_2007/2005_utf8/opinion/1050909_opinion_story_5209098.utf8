 Letters to Editor

 Which way to go?

 Sir ? The controversy over the township project of the Salim group seems to be centred around the justifiability or otherwise of acquiring productive agricultural land for industrial purposes. The issue that has been obfuscated in the process is whether there is a need for a new township at all. Five thousand acres comprises some 15,000 bighas, and that is a lot of land. With Rajarhat promising to be ready soon, is there really a need for such a large second township? Expectedly, ?the need for infrastructure development? will be proffered as a glib and all-weather explanation, but there might well be a case for a closer look.

 Two, the government so far has not given any indication that the township is part of a larger design for the city and its suburbs. Nor has the opposition asked for any. Will the new township be another arm of Calcutta or an adjunct to it, or would it be a stand-alone township by itself? What will it comprise? The ubiquitous food-court may be taken for granted, but what else? Who are the targeted residents? Will existing offices and residents of the city proper be encouraged to shift there to ease pressure on the latter, or will the space be bought up by wealthy individuals as a second or third property to be held until prices rise enough for them to make a killing? These and other similar issues must be raised and addressed when a township of this size is proposed. Strangely, neither the government nor the opposition seems to have considered whether smaller townships might not be more feasible and whether the land in closed mills and factories might not be unlocked for this purpose.

 The Bhangar township, if it materializes, may well be followed by others of its kind. They will lead to a permanent change in the ownership pattern of land in West Bengal. The social implications and cost of this must be considered well in advance of any adventurism in the name of development.

 Yours faithfully,

Apratim Ray, Calcutta

 Sir ? The editorial, ?Left enlightenment? (Sept 4), goes overboard by comparing Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee with Gautama Buddha. For one, it is a bit premature. There is no doubt that Bhattacharjee is trying hard to bring investments into West Bengal. But the plans are still on paper. The infrastructure in Salt Lake, the IT bowl of Bengal, is still abysmal. The eco-tourism project at Sundarbans, which was among his most pet projects even a few months back, is no longer heard of. His other endeavour, to bring in an Italian firm to the Bantala leather complex, which he proudly declared after his visit to Italy a few years back, has not matured at all. Truly speaking, what Bhattacharjee is trying to do in West Bengal is in strict accordance with the guidelines laid down by the CPI(M) high command. It is doubtful if he is at all steering policy-making in a new direction.

 Yours faithfully,

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? ?Left enlightenment? rightly appreciates the boldness in the chief minister?s approach to industrialization of West Bengal. The Salim group investments could indeed become the turning point in Bengal?s fate. Opening up Bengal?s economy may be the only way to find employment for millions of educated youths.

 Yours faithfully,

Salil Gewali, Shillong

 Sir ? Debashis Bhattacharyya?s ?Is the left turning right?? (Sept 4) is no more than a journalistic summary of the acrimonious and somewhat misleading debate over the wooing of foreign capital into West Bengal. It also makes certain swooping assumptions that need to be put in the right perspective. First, there is the tendency to believe that ?the interests of global capital with the interests of marginal farmers or factory workers? have to be welded together. But labour regulations, apparently the cornerstone policy for this welding to happen, has always been seen to tie down growth. The more relaxed the regulations, the greater the rise in wages, productivity and disposable incomes. Two, it is a common fallacy to see the hire-and-fire regime as necessarily bad. But if a worker is not good enough, he has to go. If the company is not making enough profits, it has to let go of some of its workers to restructure, or risk going bankrupt entirely. All economic activity has some positive impact on the poor, but this is constantly ignored, both by politicians and journalists.

 Yours faithfully,

Aruni Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? Ashok Mitra?s observation on the Left Front?s ?rent-a-womb? economic policy is unjustified. Is there any other way left for the left in this state? 

 Yours faithfully

Birkha Khadka Duvarseli, Siliguri

 Sir ? Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has been trying to tell his party a truth the world now takes for granted ? that dogmas do not help. He seems to be Bengal?s Deng Xiaoping. Unfortunately, we are thirty years behind China in matters of enlightenment. 

 Yours faithfully,

K. Chatterjee, Calcutta

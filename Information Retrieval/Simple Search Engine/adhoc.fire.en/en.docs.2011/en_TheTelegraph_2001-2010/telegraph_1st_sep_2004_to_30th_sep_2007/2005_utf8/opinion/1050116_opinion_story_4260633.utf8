 ESTRANGED BEDFELLOWS 

 - Yadavs and Muslims have stood by Laloo for 15 years

 Congress plus or minus Laloo. Paswan 

 alone. BJP plus JD(U). Or whatever else works. It?s the season 

 of shifting electoral alignments in Bihar. AVIJIT GHOSH

 The disgruntled party worker?s comment wasn?t far away from Bihar?s electoral truth. At a time when Congress has no qualms in negotiating with Laloo Prasad Yadav and Ram Vilas Paswan at the same time, or in an era where Paswan keeps his doors open to both the Congress and the rival Janata Dal (United), politics is both fluid and negotiable. Electoral alliances are stretching the limits of possibilities and coalition politics is being redefined.

 Based on caste arithmetic and convenience, every political combination has been worked out on paper ? one lot hoping to see the end of the Rashtriya Janata Dal?s 15-year rule in Bihar, the other section striving hard to retain power. And while the electoral adjustments ? including friendly fights and friendlier withdrawals ? will be out in the open soon, covert arrangements between apparent foes will only act themselves out in the dusty backwaters of Bihar.

 Social scientist D.L. Sheth believes that the ongoing process of alliances for the Bihar Assembly election is actually a part of a larger process of coalition formation. The country, he believes, is heading towards a two-coalition party system: one that is anti-Congress, and the other, anti-BJP. ?With all its contradictions, we are witnessing this process of political formation in Bihar,? Sheth says.

 On the ground, it is the coming together of short-term friends and long-term foes that makes the forthcoming Bihar elections a potential firecracker. The Congress, currently with only 12 members in the outgoing state Assembly, has to get a toehold in Bihar for its grand plans of returning as a single majority party in the nation?s polity. 

 For Ram Vilas Paswan?s Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), it is an opportunity to prove it can stand on its own feet ? and humble Laloo. And, for Laloo himself, it is a question of survival. Forget how he performed in the Lok Sabha polls. Ruling Bihar means everything to Laloo and the RJD. ?If he loses these polls, he loses everything in the long run,? says a senior Congress politician.

 Few hustings have had so many varied players with so much at stake. The slogans offer a peepshow into the electioneering saga likely to unfold in the coming weeks. The Bharatiya Janata Party and JD(U) alliance, which, as senior BJP leader Arun Jaitley says, wants to become the nucleus of all anti-RJD groups, hopes to ride on the rallying cry: Pandraah saal, Bura haal and Sarkar badlo, Bihar badlega. The BJP had only 35 seats in the 243-strong Bihar state Assembly, but led in about 70 Assembly segments in the 2004 Lok Sabha polls. ?The idea is to convert them into seats,? says Jaitley.

 Paswan?s LJP, contesting a full-fledged state Assembly polls for the first time, has borrowed a simple and effective line made famous by filmmaker Manoj Kumar in the Seventies. It says, LJP ka yehi ailaan, roti kapda aur makaan. And, Bihar Congress leader Vijay Shankar Dubey says from Patna that its slogans will be decided shortly ? an indicator, perhaps, of the party?s unpreparedness on the ground.

 In stark contrast, sitting in his small office in New Delhi, RJD spokesperson Sanjay Paswan explains in detail how the party hopes to retain power. ?Our slogan is,? he says, in his trademark baritone, ?Pandraah varsh: samman, utkarsh. Aur paanch varsh: vikas aur harsh.? Hidden in those 10 words are a summary of what the Laloo rule is all about and how the party is desperately trying to re-invent itself. It is notable that while samman (dignity) is the key word to express achievement, Laloo ? having given the socially backward a sense of dignity in Bihar ? now promises development.

 When Laloo rode to power after social plates were re-aligned following the Mandal wave in the Nineties, it was mainly due to his forging of a seemingly invincible caste alliance of Yadavs, Muslims, Dalits and Other Backward Castes (OBCs). But in these 15 years, as contradictions in the combine came to the fore, a large section of Dalits and OBCs moved away. Still, Yadavs and Muslims, who form 26 per cent of the voting population, have stayed with Laloo.

 During this election, says the RJD spokesperson, the party will try to duplicate a formula it had used earlier in the 2004 Lok Sabha polls. ?The party is trying to broaden its social base by putting up upper-caste candidates in constituencies where they dominate,? says Sanjay Paswan. 

 Brahmin Raghunath Jha won from Motihari and Bhumihar Akhilesh Prasad Singh from Bettiah. Laloo has not just been uncharacteristically soft to upper castes in his speeches, but has been taking time off to attend gatherings of Bhumihars and Brahmins.

 Laloo?s inclusive caste strategy is prompted by the emergence of LJP and an adamant Congress. He still holds the cards but controlling his own flock is no longer easy. 

 Political scientist Imtiaz Ahmed, who recently visited Bihar, believes that too many Yadavs are interested in contesting on an RJD ticket. ?Those who will not get tickets will contest as independents and eat into his vote,? he says. And, Muslims, always an essential part of his winning arithmetic, are now asking for more, a fact borne out by RJD leader Taslimuddin?s resignation from the post of chairman of the party?s parliamentary board last week.

 In this backdrop, Congress?s badgering for more seats and the threat that LJP poses to RJD?s Dalit votes leaves Laloo with little room to manoeuvre. He is shifting sitting MLAs to other constituencies to minimise the anti-incumbency factor. And as Sanjay Paswan reveals, the party is also trying to project local Muslim leaders in the Purnea division, where the RJD is not an electoral success. They are even trying to counter Paswan with more Paswans, as Sanjay Paswan?s own induction into the party from the BJP two months ago would indicate.

 The truth, though, is that Ram Vilas Paswan still controls most of the 5 per cent Paswan votes. Having quit NDA over the Gujarat riots, he has worked hard to win over Muslims since ? but has made no serious dent into Laloo?s vote bank. His party also lacks an organised structure. 

 To Paswan?s credit, he has managed to keep the Congress by his side. Paswan believes that getting the Congress to align with him will add some Muslim, upper- caste and other Extremely Backward Caste (EBC) votes to his kitty. Insiders also believe that he will have a tacit understanding with both the JD(U) and Congress in several areas.

 On its part, the Congress finds itself on a tricky wicket. With electoral alliance having been reduced to seat adjustments ? neither of the parties will put up a candidate where the other side has a sitting MLA ? it is difficult for the national party to move ahead. In a state where caste is paramount, not having a fixed vote among any of the major social groups is a major handicap. It is unlikely that it can do anything more than eat into some upper- caste votes of the BJP ? and there are some in RJD who insist that Laloo is not really unhappy with the Congress? decision to go it alone because it may well erode the BJP?s vote.

 After the 2004 Lok Sabha election, the Congress is back as a talking point but it is unlikely that the Muslims and the Dalits will vote for the party as they did before the Nineties. But, the RJD and its partners are not greatly worried about the constituents battling each other in the state. ?It won?t be easy for the Congress,? says CPI leader D. Raja. ?On what issues will the Congress campaign against the RJD when they are both partners at the Centre?? he asks.

 In this scenario, the BJP-JD(U) combine is hoping to focus on those who, in Jaitley?s words, ?have suffered under the RJD rule?. Former Union minister and BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad points out that the party is trying to forge a social rainbow that would include all the non-Laloo votes. ?The party has worked with Extreme Backward Castes such as Gangai, Kewat, Nishad and Chandravanshi,? he says. ?We hope to do well among them.? As a whole, the BJP-JD(U) coalition expects to win votes in the Koshi belt, the Bhagalpur area, central Bihar, Patna and the Mithila region.

 Right now, the election translates into strategies and counter-strategies on paper. Political pundits are eagerly waiting to see how the game of electioneering is actually played out in the coming few weeks. 

 The current situation is summed up by a former top Samata Party leader from Bihar: ?We have the strongest anti-incumbency wave against Laloo ever. But ironically it may not be reflected in the results. In the absence of a genuine political alternative, people have no option but to fall back on caste arithmetic.? And, caste arithmetic favours the RJD supremo.

 It is possible the forthcoming 

 polls would give sleepless nights to the Election Commission 

 of India, will send the price of guns and cartridges soaring 

 in nearby states, and give Shekhar Suman a fresh quota of 

 Laloo jokes. But it might also be another election which 

 does not disprove the catchphrase: Jab tak rahega samose 

 mein aaloo, tab tak raaj karega Laloo.

 Bringing up the rear 

 Not left out

 When the CPI M-L (Liberation) spoke about the need for 

 a Third Front as an anti-NDA, non-UPA force in Bihar two 

 months ago, it wasnt immediately clear who the party 

 had in mind. The picture unfurled further in the next few 

 weeks, as the radical Left party tried its best to cobble 

 together a ragtag coalition of a dozen-odd non-entities 

 in Bihar politics: such as the Samajwadi Party, Forward 

 Bloc, Samajwadi Jan Parishad, Soshit Samaj Dal and Momin 

 Front.

 Hope floats

 But the deal is now off, says party general secretary Dipankar 

 Bhattacharya, because some parties were not firm about the 

 coalition, while others had seat adjustment problems. But 

 I still believe that the Third Front is a strategic imperative. 

 Our efforts will continue, he says. 

 Plan of action

 The party is working to get more than the five Assembly 

 seats it currently holds in Bihar. Their slogan: Bahut hua 

 ab bas karo, Janta aati hai, kursi khali karo. It will contest 

 about 100 seats and expects to give a good fight in at least 

 30.

 On the anvil

 The partys election agenda is three-fold. It will 

 focus on the famine-like situation in north Bihar, including 

 widespread unemployment, all-round criminalisation of society, 

 feudal-mafia terror and police repression. We will 

 project ourselves as the only real party of opposition, 

 says Bhattacharya.

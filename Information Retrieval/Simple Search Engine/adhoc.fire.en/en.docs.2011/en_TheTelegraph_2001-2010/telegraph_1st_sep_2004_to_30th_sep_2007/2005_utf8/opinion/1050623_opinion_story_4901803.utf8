 A LOT OF HUFFING AND PUFFING

 The ban on smoking in films is India?s misguided way of telling the world how serious it is about combating cancer, writes Sumanta Sen

 Smokers will be smokers

 There is a scene in Satyajit Ray?s Seemabaddha where the hero and his friend are discussing the proposed ban on cigarette advertisement. The friend wonders whether this would help cut down smoking as the manufacture of cigarettes would continue. Now the government has decided to ban all film scenes which show the characters smoking ? of course, with a few exceptions. Last week, Ray?s question was repeated on television by a representative of the Mumbai film industry. The question remains unanswered in Ray?s film, as well as in reality.

 And yet, that is exactly where the problem lies. Can the manufacture of cigarettes, or bidis or chewing tobacco, be banned? What then will happen to the large number of people these manufacturers employ and the larger number who sell these products? What about the tobacco-growers? Will they be asked to grow some other crop? What about those employed by companies manufacturing the paper for the cigarettes? There can be no straight and easy answer to such questions. The government knows this and hence seeks to go in for gimmicks.

 The proposed ban will become effective for films released after October 2. So a multiplex can well show a film in which the characters are merrily puffing away and another in which smoking is a strict no-no. Apart from the obvious contradiction here, it also needs to be asked, what is the extent to which a film character who is smoking makes somebody pick up the habit. Most of us picked up the habit to tell the world, and ourselves, that we had become adults, and not because some actors smoked. One is sure that it is the same even today. Yes, some would imitate the style of smoking of particular heroes, but that?s a different matter. 

 If the information minister, S. Jaipal Reddy, or the health minister, Anbumani Ramadoss, believes that by keeping films ?smoke-free?, they would be able to hit hard at the habit, then they are living in their own paradise. If the product is available, then it will be consumed. That?s human nature. If smoking is on the decline, as is often claimed, then that?s all for the good. It also makes the need for the proposed ban on screen smoking that much more doubtful.

 Certain exceptions have been allowed. Any historical character who smoked would be allowed to be represented as a smoker for the sake of realism. In India, the issue is largely academic. Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose, by all available accounts, smoked. But god save the filmmaker who shows them doing so. They are heroes, and in this country, heroes are not supposed to have ordinary human urges. So while many legendary nationalist leaders were known to have a weakness for alcohol, one cannot imagine a film in which they will be shown having a drink in the evening. And, if a ?historical character? is really shown smoking and no questions are asked, may that not encourage a devoted follower to emulate his leader? In that case, the purpose, doubtful as it is, will be lost. Or does the government believe that the heroes of yesteryear no longer have any sizeable following and so there is no real danger there?

 Cigarette smoking is injurious to health, is the warning which every packet must carry. But so also is alcohol which has been found to increase the risk of cancer. How is it then that the glossies carry elaborate accounts of the preparation of cocktails or the wines that should be served with particular dishes? If some think that wine is not dangerous, then they, as it is said, have got a thing coming. With imported brand names of wines, spirits and beer freely available these days, where is the official concern for health? Of course, here also there is the ridiculous clause that an alcoholic product can be advertised only if it is camouflaged, a screen that is easily seen through. Over the years, hypocrisy seems to have become our second nature. We are being officially told to be vague instead of asking for Haig. As for the ban on smoking on screen, it is not quite clear whether the ban will apply to telefilms also. There seems to be a grey area there.

 Cancer is undoubtedly a dreaded disease and needs to be fought hard. But in India, so also are malaria, small pox, kala azar, gastroenteritis and other diseases. What are the authorities doing about tackling these? Why was malaria allowed to return after it was eradicated over 50 years ago? These are all killer diseases, taking heavy tolls throughout the year all over the country and particularly in the countryside. What effective steps have been taken to counter arsenic poisoning? Why is the anti-rabies vaccine, or the anti-venom serum, not available easily? Why this obvious apathy towards certain diseases and militant combat of others?

 The answer seems to be simple. These are tropical diseases and so one cannot be seen as really keeping up with the Joneses of the first world by devoting greater attention to these. Cancer, on the other hand, is the white man?s problem as much as it is a problem to third world people, and so the world must know how worried we are about it. Gastroenteritis is hardly a suitable seminar topic. Cancer most certainly is. It is the same thing with AIDS. 

 Coming back to the ban on scenes showing people smoking. It should not be difficult to make films without such scenes but will viewers realize that the absence of such scenes is aimed at making them conscious of the dangers of taking a puff? Will people go to see a film conscious of what such untold messages seek to convey? Surely they do not, even in Tamil Nadu, from where the health minister hails and where films have become a part of the state?s political life. If a direct warning in the form of the words on cigarette packets has not been that effective, what can be expected of a legislation that seeks to work in a roundabout manner?

 It seems that the prevention of cancer is not so much the purpose of the legislation as it is to tell the world how conscious India is of the dangers of the disease and how it is leaving no stone unturned in making people conscious of it. When the ban comes into effect after October 2, India will be the first country in the world to have brought such a legislation. 

 As far as publicity is concerned, this is great news, and that perhaps was at the back of the health minister?s mind when he thought of the measure. But perhaps he realized that he had no alternative to such gimmicks, since it is plain enough that cigarettes and bidis will continue to be smoked as long as these are manufactured. And there is just no way in which the manufacture can be, or will be, stopped.

 But don?t such gimmicks take away a lot from the awareness of the real danger? It would be better perhaps if the authorities took up more seriously the task of enforcing laws like the ban on smoking in public places. Ultimately, of course, a habit cannot be removed by wielding the law. The urge to give it up must always come from within.

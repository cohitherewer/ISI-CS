 Letters to Editor

 Not slow enough

 Sir ? Has The Telegraph taken upon itself to boost the sagging morale of Sourav Ganguly? ?Sourav cocks a snook at Asia selectors? (Aug 4) alleges that Inzamam-ul-Haque was the slowest to reach 10,000 among the three batsman (Ganguly and Tendulkar being the other two), and Ganguly a touch slower than Sachin. But Ganguly had scored in single or double digits in his last 4 international matches, and to reach 10,000, he needed some 60-odd runs in 6 matches at the start of the Pakistan series. Would we still call Inzamam ?slow??

 Yours faithfully,

 Pure fancy

 Sir ? Khushwant Singh?s ?Sermons on the idiot box? (July 29) exposes his bias against Muslims and also his ignorance about Islam. He criticizes Zakir Naik for asking Muslims to grow long beards and clip moustaches, and Muslim women to observe purdah. If Singh has his way, he would probably want Muslims to forget their identity. But why Muslims alone? Would he not advise the same to Hindus, Christians, Jains and his Sikh brethren? His claim that the hijab is on its way out, except for Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan, is absurd. The use of the hijab has been rising all over the world as Muslim women have understood its usefulness, especially when crime against women is on the rise. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The famous sardar takes on Zakir Naik, but forgets that Naik was only quoting from the Quran. Also, he picks only some parts of Naik?s talk in order to malign Muslims. But if Muslims are discouraged from keeping long beards, so should Sikhs. For the beard, to both the communities, are part of their religious identity. Another thing. Singh lists Pakistan as an ?advanced? Muslim country. Has he forgotten the more advanced Muslim countries like Malaysia and Indonesia, where the hijab is popular? 

Yours faithfully, 

Mansoor Danish, Calcutta 

 Sir ? This is not the first time that Khushwant Singh has criticized someone without reason. Ever since Zakir Naik started appearing on television to clear misconceptions about Islam, Singh seems to be losing sleep. He has often accused Naik of rubbishing other religions. But can such an accusation be brought against anyone who is just quoting from other religious scriptures? Naik, in fact, often talks about similarities of other religions like Hinduism and Christianity with Islam in an attempt to eradicate misunderstandings. 

 Moreover, it sounds rather odd to hear someone like Khushwant Singh trying to give lessons to Muslims about women. A person who exhorts his readers to fantasize about their maidservants can hardly be the best judge of social behaviour. Naik is not against working women as long as the work is lawful and the women can maintain their Islamic dress code. Islam indeed does not allow intermingling of the sexes. That, however, does not mean that the religion does not give women their due rights. It just prevents them from being reduced to ?society butterflies? who are tools in the hands of pleasure-seekers.

 Yours faithfully,

Abdul Gafoor Qureshi, Mumbai

 Sir ?Has Singh signed a pact with Praveen Togadia? 

Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The seniormost communist leader in India, Harkishen Singh Surjeet, sports a turban and wears his beard long, in keeping with Sikh prescriptions. This despite Surjeet being a communist and non- believer. 

 Yours faithfully,

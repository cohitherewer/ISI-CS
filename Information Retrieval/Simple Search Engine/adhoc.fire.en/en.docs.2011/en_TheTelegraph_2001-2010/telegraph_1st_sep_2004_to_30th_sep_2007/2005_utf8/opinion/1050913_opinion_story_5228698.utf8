 NO CLASSES

 In an ideal world, a child is simply a child ? irrespective of religion, colour, caste and class. Yet a child cannot choose not to be born into a religion, colour, caste and class. It is often the most helpless victim of the various inequalities fostered by these social actualities, most of which come into play when it starts going to school or ? just as important ? when it cannot be sent to one. Hence, the Kothari Commission?s four-decades-old idea of a common schooling system. Such a system would provide publicly-funded schools open to all children, whatever their social and economic status. Primary and secondary education would be provided in these schools, free of charge, and of a quality that would encourage middle-class and rich guardians to send their children to these schools without falling back on expensive and socially discriminatory private schools, which have consistently ignored their obligation to take in a certain number of underprivileged students. 

 The government again intends to ?revive the debate? on common schools, connected to the bill on free and compulsory education for children between six and fourteen. First, the women?s bill saga should have taught Indians, by now, what ?reviving debates? means in state parlance: token waffling, dithering and wasting of valuable public time when there is absolutely no political or intellectual will to think through fundamental issues of gender inequality and the quota system. The same is most likely to happen with the common-school debate, as a brutally class- and caste-driven nation, ridden with every kind of inequality and unthinkingly cruel to millions of children, pretends to mull over the possibility of classless education. Second, most government schools, particularly in rural areas, are abysmally inadequate in the quality of education and infrastructure they provide to the poorest of the poor. Without bringing these schools up to the mark, at the most rudimentary levels of functioning, India cannot afford to indulge in utopian visions. 

 Finally, improving these schools should not amount to pulling down the standards and conditions of the existing ?good? schools, most of them private and elitist, within the existing system. Education, at whatever level, is as much about merit, excellence and standards as about equality of access and opportunity. To destroy whatever exists of the former in order to ensure the latter would be carrying experimentation to a very dangerous extent.

 STATE?S TERMS

 He who pays the piper calls the tune. Even those who consider this to be an extreme position will agree that the provider of funds should have some say in the choice of tunes. This is the simple logic behind the West Bengal government?s decision that missionary schools affiliated to the primary and secondary boards of education and receiving funds from the state must abide by the rules set by the government when they recruit heads. This might appear at first sight to be an attempt on the part of the state to interfere in the affairs of missionary schools but it should be viewed as a step to streamline the recruitment process. Thus far, missionary schools have sought the cover of minority institutions. But even as minority institutions, most, if not all, of them have received state subventions. There is the fear, on the part of the schools, that the government?s decision is the thin end of the wedge and that it will eventually lead to recruitment through the school service commission. The government should take all possible steps to dispel such fears and to reassure the schools that their autonomy is not under threat. The state should not have the final say in recruitment of either heads of missionary schools or of teachers. But the claim that the state should not have any say is unnecessarily exaggerated.

 Those schools which feel uncomfortable with the state?s presence in recruitment have a simple option before them: they can stop taking state funding. This is perhaps the bottomline. Receiving money from the state entails some form of accountability to it. Missionary schools can hardly expect state assistance to be free from any kind of conditionality. There is also the context of complaints, increasingly being articulated in public and from within minority communities, of the way missionary schools are run. The government cannot remain indifferent to such complaints especially when it spends money from the exchequer to support these schools. The government has taken one step to make the administration of missionary schools more open and more accountable. Too strong a protest against the government?s decision may prove to be self-defeating since it will aggravate the suspicion that missionary schools are against transparency and accountability. Let the schools not protest too much.

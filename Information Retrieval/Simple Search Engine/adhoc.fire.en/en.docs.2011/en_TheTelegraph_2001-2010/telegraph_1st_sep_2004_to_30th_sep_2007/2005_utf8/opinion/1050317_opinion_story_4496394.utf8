The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letters to Editor

 Fair-weather friends 

 Sir ? Now that she has consolidated her political standing, Sonia Gandhi seems to think that it is time to mend fences with lost friends (?A Bachchan looks up Sonia?, March 15). And no one can grudge her this desire. But as a powerful politician, Sonia can?t be too careful about the company she is seen in. Remember how the Gandhis came under the scanner because of their friendship with Satish Sharma? The relationship with the Bachchans has become very acrimonious lately with Amitabh and Jaya going over to the Samajwadi Party, the Congress?s principal enemy in the hotly contested state of Uttar Pradesh. The revival of ties with Ramola Bachchan, at this juncture, might revive the bad blood on both sides. Also, the Congress president had better be wary of ?friends? who feel their proximity to her means that they have access to a ready-made career in politics.

 Yours faithfully,

R. Subramanian, Calcutta 

 Justice for all 

 Sir ? A uniform civil code need not necessarily be gender just, but a gender-just civil code must apply uniformly to all women. But no one seems interested in ensuring that the latter becomes a reality. Rather the fact that leaders from the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress were invited to The Telegraph debate on whether a uniform civil code is needed in India indicates the depths to which the discourse has sunk. People like Narendra Modi have nothing do with not just women, but with the common people in general. 

 The BJP?s anti-Muslim stance is the key to understanding its support for the uniform civil code. Neither is the Congress above board. Rajiv Gandhi had reversed the Supreme Court?s verdict in the Shah Bano case and passed a bill that deprived divorced Muslim women from being given maintenance. It is only the women?s movement in India that has been sincere about the issue. The civil code relates to the laws of inheritance of property, divorce and custody of children. And there can be no doubt that the prevalent codes are biased in favour of men. We do need a gender-just secular civil code but it must not be in contravention of the spirit of justice. And justice is the biggest victim in the hands of religious nationalism. If any serious debate is to be organized, then it should not involve the political parties, but feminist groups, human rights groups, and activist bodies.

 Yours faithfully,

Rohit Prajapati, Vadodara

 Sir ? I was appalled to find that Narendra Modi was one of the speakers at this year?s debate. In a just world, Modi should be standing trial for his complicity in the genocide that occurred in Gujarat in 2003. By inviting him, what message did The Telegraph seek to convey? That the fact that he and his administration were involved in the deaths of many did not matter? Or have you decided to shift to the right? 

 Yours faithfully, 

Aanish Chaudhuri, Auckland

 Sir ? This year?s debate was extremely lively. The speakers chosen were persons of eminence and all of them did well in the battle of words. But why should we the see same faces and moderator, year after year? 

 Yours faithfully,

Basudeb Bhattacharya,

 Sir ? I would like to draw attention to a point Dileep Padgaonkar made in his brief summing-up ?we need to see if the topic itself has much relevance in today?s society. Instead of ?To be truly secular, India needs a uniform civil code?, if the opinion of the house had been sought for ?Should all religions be made to submit to the same set of laws?, the audience might perhaps have voted very differently. 

 Yours faithfully,

Amitabha Mukerjee, Kanpur

 Sir ? The report, ?Civil code of discord? (March 14), quotes Mani Shankar Aiyar as wondering why the ?minority community should accept diktat of a man like Modi?. Aiyar?s use of personal vilification, instead of logical arguments, exposed his shallowness. It is a pity that such acerbic and insubstantial remarks are given so much prominence. After all, the motion was not whether Modi should decide on the civil code. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sunil V. Khaitan, Calcutta

 Sir ?The Telegraph-Calcutta Club National Debate evoked extraordinary interest. What was truly amazing was that Narendra Modi was applauded the most by the crowd. But the point that created the most stir among the audience was Arun Jaitley?s suggestion that if the Muslim minority wanted to have their civil code according to the Quran, then why should not the criminal laws that governed them also be based on the Quran? This point was not taken up by Syed Sahabhuddin and Salman Khurshid. More than 90 per cent of the audience were agreed that there should be a uniform civil code in India. How long will our politicians continue to ignore this issue?

 Yours faithfully,

S.C. Hada, Calcutta

 Sir ? I had a lot of difficulty in getting a pass to The Telegraph National Debate. Many years ago, at a debate held in the Netaji Indoor Stadium on the subject, ?Politicians are menace to the society?, Russi Mody had said, ?They are like women, we can neither stay with them nor without them.? This is quite true. Most of us will flock to hear the politicians in the evening, after having abused them through the day. Henceforth, a more spacious venue should be arranged to accommodate all those interested so that the debate does not become an exclusive affair.

 Yours faithfully,

Md. Aslam Parvez, Calcutta

 FIRST SENTENCE

 Mob violence has great advantages. The difficulty of fixing culpability for the most horrific actions allows some of the cruellest murderers to go free. The first sentence in one episode of mass murder during the Gujarat carnage has come almost four years after a mob burnt a woman and threw her and two children into a well and set others on fire in the Panchmahal district. In spite of the odds, the fast-track court responsible for the sentencing has awarded life terms to 11 out of the 29 persons charged. This degree of certainty could be reached only after the evidence of 80 witnesses, but even then, the 18 others could not be convicted. The process of judgment itself is a painful evocation of the scale and hideousness of the carnage. For the same court sentenced three members of a 34-strong mob to 10 years? rigorous imprisonment and a fine ? and one name is common to both lists of names. The crowd is accused of kidnapping and murdering a shopkeeper of the minority community, burning others, robbing them, destroying their property and desecrating a mosque. Once again, the majority of the offenders went free because of the lack of evidence.

 For all that, there is relief that the guilty are being tried. The Gujarat carnage is one of the most terrible moments of India?s recent history, made uglier by the obvious complicity of the state. This was, from the very beginning, the greatest hurdle, not only in the search for justice for the victims but also in the process of their rehabilitation. Even now, although the action taken report on rehabilitation has ultimately been submitted by the state government to the Nanavati-Shah commission at the insistence of the National Human Rights Commission, and the Supreme Court?s repeated rebukes and directions brought some semblance of regularity to the enormous project of seeking justice, the situation is far from satisfactory. The fast-track court?s sentences are especially valuable for that reason. Indians like to forget quickly, they do not want to be reminded of moments when their fragile pretence to secularism and equality has been exposed as sham. Politicians would be only too glad to forget. Only one thing could be worse than the carnage itself: the failure to achieve justice for all the victims and punishment for the guilty. Claims to democracy and secularism will remain empty till that is done.

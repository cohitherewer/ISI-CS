 TO KNOW HOW TO DO GOOD

 MALVIKA SINGH

 It is rather disturbing when one hears protagonists of the tribal rights bill explaining and elaborating fresh demands that are being made to restore the rights of tribals and return forest lands to them. Those NGOs which support and advocate the return of forest land to tribals and are vociferous in the media come across as not having done their homework. They appear confused when faced with logical criticism, look flummoxed when their interpretation of facts is challenged and are unable to hold the argument. This lack of study is frightening. Do-gooding, living off national and international grants that are poured in to create agendas that are meant to address poverty, participating in reports and task forces that produce recommendations where solutions rest on killing one for the other are all very well, but without comprehending the changing realities, without hearing and listening to contrary voices, the consequences of such superficial policies and actions will reduce those who desperately need a restoration of dignity to far worse penury. 

 Mafias of all description, led by the administrative and political mafia, will dangle skeletal baits and usurp what today stands protected under the law of this land. The leaders in the UPA seem to have abdicated their intellects, judgment and thinking to the CPI(M) and the NGOs which people the National Advisory Council. The UPA should get down to the hard task of slashing the weight and size of government, to fighting corruption on a war footing, much like dealing with the plague. None of this is happening. The Congress is more concerned with following the diktats of the CPI(M) that supports It from outside, a party that did not have the dignity to join government only because it wants to play power politics. This CPI(M) ?support? smacks of hypocrisy, aggrandisement and, often, blackmail. It is detrimental to Bharat. 

 US and them

 Then there is the overseas avatar of the UPA. When we all know that it is critical for the US to extend itself to India for its own geopolitical reasons, why do we not stand straight in that ?friendship?? Why do we always appear subservient, bending over to please our new annadatas? Why do we not talk at par, befriend at an equal level, work at the same level together? Why must we adjust our geopolitical requirements to suit the US? Why must we accept the arrogance and condescension of the big bully? The decline of the US has begun. Surely this UPA government is savvy enough to see that reality. Surely it can forge an equal partnership. We too have our strengths and we should assert them with the US as it looks for a fresh stomping ground in our neighbourhood. 

 The US would want India and Iran to be in conflict. It would want India and Bangladesh to be in conflict. It would want India and Pakistan to be in eternal conflict. It is time to confront the US and its conflict-endorsing policies across the world. The poverty and plight of our people will not disappear because of being a US satellite. No knowledge-based industry, ranging from craft skills to film and IT, our ever growing attribute and strength, will benefit from a sell-out. Peace in the region will not get any impetus if we are seen to be a US stooge nation. The only immediate repercussion of a one-sided alliance will be anarchic terrorism in the subcontinent, much like what the US and Britain are facing. Why would the UPA want to endanger the lives of Indians? Why would any Indian government want to side with those who have an anathema for the Islamic world, who have assaulted it brutally and then wondered why humans become bombs? If the US can be paranoid after one attack, why does it expect Muslims, who have been assaulted for decades, to stand by and fold their hands in obeisance? What inhuman expectations!

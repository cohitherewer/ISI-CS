 PUBLIC AND THE PRIVATE

 Left out

 Civil society, public sphere and citizenship: Dialogues and 

 perceptions 

 Edited by Rajeev Bhargava and Helmut Reifeld, 

 Sage, Rs 750

 What is the impact of civil society on the Indian state? Does India have a strong civil society? How is it different from the public sphere and where actually do we as citizens play our role? Interrogating such issues has remained an ongoing process but it needs to be renewed with fresh inputs and herein lies the contribution of this particular book.

 The state is an independent public authority with monopoly over institutionalized forces while civil society is an arena of self-regulating voluntary associations that lie outside the state. The public sphere refers to a common space accessible to all. Rajeev Bhargava begins by differentiating these concepts but the other essayists in this volume often disagree on how they should be used.

 Ute Frevert refers to civil society as urban groups based on principles of voluntary and equal membership, transparency of system and financial self-sufficiency and adds that contemporary civil society embodies a political vision to empower the individual as well as to rekindle social cohesiveness. Farhat Hasan states that ?civil society? and ?public sphere? pre-dated even the British era in India as pre-British Muslim society was pluralist, diverse, vibrant and ?publicity of representation?, integral to Habermas?s conception of the modern public sphere, could be neatly woven into it.

 Clemens Albrecht?s postulation is different from that of Habermas. Albrecht states that appropriateness of political theory must be judged by an understanding of the political history of particular societies. Neera Chandhoke too is critical of Habermas?s theory and argues that it signifies the antithesis of the use of any kind of force in the discursive field, and therefore ignores historically handed down deprivations caused by structural unevenness.

 Sudhir Chandra states that the relationship between civil and colonial society was marked by friction and confusion in the 19th century and one must understand the emergence of the idea of citizenship and the growth of an Indian public space in this context. Neeladri Bhattacharya explores the non-western public sphere of India by locating it within colonial modernity. The public and the private, according to him, were marked by dual tendencies of modernity and tradition and there were subtle variations in the ways in which they were shaped in different parts of India.

 Javeed Alam contends that the relationship between democracy and civil society is more complex in India than in the West due to the different historical conditions under which they arose and the divergent socio-economic forces that continue to shape them.

 Valerian Rodrigues identifies two phases of citizenship in independent India. The first can be identified by an exclusivist bent wherein citizens formed the polity and defined its orientations. Over time, this conception of citizenship was replaced by a second idea in which citizenship came to reflect a ?common national identity?, thereby imposing a certain role expectation on citizens. In a different context, B. S. Chimni and Bagmar Bernstorff deal with the plight of those who are excluded from citizenship ?the refugees and the exiled.

 Gopal Guru complicates the question of inclusion and exclusion by addressing the Dalit issue and saying that the dream of equal citizenship rights still eludes them. Anuradha Chenoy studies the impact of the breakdown of the public sphere on women and says that as peacemakers women possess not just symbolic value but are active, but unequal, participants in the common project of retrieving the public sphere.

 This book brings forth original, empirical and exploratory essays on several contentious issues that might interest students of political theory, political sociology and history.

 MORE FUN THAN FILMS

 Sashi Kumar

 Having to put up with a poorly organized film festival in Goa without criticizing Goa itself is a difficult task. Indeed, Goa was at its carnivalesque best during the ten days of the international film festival held there earlier this month. The stretch from Dabolin airport to Panaji was festooned with buntings. Arches across the road and rectangular props with the festival motif on traffic islands en route welcomed you again and again. The street on which the twin festival-screening complexes and the structures housing related festival activity were located had been cordoned off and looked like a boulevard in old European cities. Evenings transformed the street into riotous music and song, sung for the most part like Dimple Kapadia?s Goan family of revellers in Bobby. And there was party after grand party to win over the festival gentry.

 Outside the four-screen Inox multiplex where delegates hung around, a never-ending succession of live bands belted out high-decibel numbers, even as jugglers, monocyclists and ten-feet-plus guys on stilts kept small groups amused. Stepping out of a rare disturbing film into this raucous partying, you instantly put any artistic mulling behind you. It was Fellini descreened ? the carnival of his frame becoming the framework of the festival itself.

 If this was the scene outside, what was happening inside? Very little, unfortunately. The foreign fare was, but for a handful of films including Motorcycle Diaries and Syrian Bride, dismal. The Panorama section, supposed to showcase the best of creative Indian cinema of the year, found itself brushed aside by the high-pitched lobbying and publicity of the new brand of ?crossover? films from Bollywood. The long queue for the old Amitabh starrer Bombay to Goa told it all ? Bollywood, old and new, had come to Goa and Goa was delightfully lapping it up. 

 At the head of the celebrations was Goa?s chief minister, Manohar Parrikar, an affable impresario weaving through it all, releasing a publication, inaugurating a festival event, enquiring after his guests, helping form a line for a buffet. Having invested hugely in his bid to make Goa a permanent film fest venue, he was not to be disheartened by anything. 

 An eye on tourism

 He also put in select appearances, among them for Bharat Bala?s Hari Om, a rite of touristy passage through Rajasthan, at which he stayed for about 10 minutes and left. Indeed, watching only a few minutes of a film seemed to be a ploy hit upon by a section of the delegates to cover as many films as possible, so much so that many screenings had a floating population moving in and out, exasperating those who wanted to see an entire film undisturbed. 

 Is Goa as a setting injurious to serious cinema? That is perhaps an unfair question because this festival only bared the foamy, celebratory face of the state. There is, no doubt, a cerebral Goa which should have engaged with the festival but couldn?t, because of the way it was cast. The fun and frolic state of mind that Goa willy-nilly invokes, and that its government seemed to promote during this festival, would possibly be good tourist promotion but bad for a rigorous and critical contemplation of newer forms of style and expression, of thematic departures. These are attempted and achieved, for good part, by auteurs in our country, with little means and a lot of pain and sacrifice. An international film festival is, in most cases, their only forum of expression and hope. To deny them this space and occasion of fulfilment would be to strike a body blow at the already beleaguered, even if relatively young, tradition of the different cinema in India ? a tradition that is strongly nurtured in regional cinema.

 But Goa has another chance to set at rest next year the doubts and concerns of its commitment to serious cinema that have been raised this year.

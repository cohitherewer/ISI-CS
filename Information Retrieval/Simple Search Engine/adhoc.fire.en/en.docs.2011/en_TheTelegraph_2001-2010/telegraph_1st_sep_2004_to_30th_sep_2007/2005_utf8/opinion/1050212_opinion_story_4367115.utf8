 PRINCE AND THE SHOWGIRL

 Divorce has always been a thorny issue in the history of the British monarchy. One divorce made Henry VIII break with the Church of Rome. The decision to marry a divorcee forced another king to abdicate and become the Duke of Windsor. Prince Charles?s announcement that he is going to marry Ms Camilla Parker-Bowles this April appears to have had a smooth passage. But that should not suggest that the matter is without any complications. Rather, it is another instance of the double standards the British employ to sidestep uncomfortable questions. The announcement of the wedding moves Charles and Ms Parker-Bowles?s relationship from an affair to the realms of legality. But it is in the ramifications of the legal that problems arise. Henry VIII was the last king who was divorced. Charles, if and when he becomes king, will be the second. Thus Ms Parker-Bowles will take her position next to her husband not as Princess of Wales but will be called the Duchess of Cornwall and will have the title of Her Royal Highness. Similarly, on Charles succeeding his mother to the throne she will be called the Princess Consort, the female version of what Albert was during the reign of Queen Victoria. Perhaps this will be the first time that Britain will be without a queen.

 This deft and swift shifting of titles is designed to avoid too much controversy. Another example is the response of the Church of England. The wedding will be a civil ceremony which will be followed by a prayer service and dedication at St George?s Chapel presided over by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Thus the wedding will have the blessings of the church and not have it. The Prince of Wales and his bride will have their cake and eat it too. The people of Britain and their representatives in the House of Commons should decide how important they consider the rituals that surround the monarchy. Do they think that the Royal Marriages Act, a piece of legislation that was enacted in 1772, to be of any relevance in the 21st century? A legislation that decrees that a royal couple should seek the formal approval of the bridegroom?s mother is risible, and when two persons both approaching 60 are subjected to such a law, it looks ridiculous.

 The ridiculous is, perhaps, the appropriate trope for the forthcoming royal event. The bride-to-be, let it not be forgotten, takes pride in the fact that her maternal great-great-grandmother, Alice Keppel, was a mistress of Edward VII. Ms Parker-Bowles can claim with some justification that she has come up in the world. She was once likened to a rottweiler by Diana, Charles?s first wife. Ms Parker-Bowles can now have run of the corgis. A private occasion, a wedding, will have the public glare on it and this will only remove some of the magic and the mystery which Walter Bagehot thought are the bulwarks of the monarchy in a modern age.

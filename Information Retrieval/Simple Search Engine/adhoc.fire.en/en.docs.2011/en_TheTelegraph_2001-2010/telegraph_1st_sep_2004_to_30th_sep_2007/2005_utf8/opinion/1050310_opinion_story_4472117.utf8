 POWER AND RISK

 Power and popularity can be risky things for a leader who is unsure of how to use them. Mr Subash Ghisingh wants to use them to paralyse life in the Darjeeling hills. Of course, he has his own reasons for holding out the threat. He wants the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council, of which he has been the chairman since its inception in 1988, to be replaced by another body of his choice. And, when the term of the present council expires on March 25, he wants to reign over it as the ?caretaker? until fresh elections are held. Unless the West Bengal government bows to his demands, he has threatened to call a series of bandhs in Darjeeling, leading to a 51-day strike beginning in June. The threat makes clear why he foiled the government?s attempts to hold elections to the DGHC. Also, there could not be a clearer signal of his intention to risk everything in order to retain power. The fact that he has preferred a coercive strategy to negotiations with the government cannot but be alarming. Despite some erosion in his support base, Mr Ghisingh retains much of the power he used to plunge the hills into turmoil in the mid-Eighties. But it would be irresponsible for him to go back to violent ways after running the council uninterruptedly for 17 years. 

 For any government, it is one thing to consider popular demands and quite another to even appear to submit to the politics of blackmail. The chief minister, Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, has to decide how to deal with Mr Ghisingh?s demands without bowing to his threats. The government?s anxiety to avoid a confrontation with him was evident in its decision not to go ahead with the elections. Mr Bhattacharjee also agreed to have a different nomenclature for the council, as suggested by Mr Ghisingh. It may even be advisable to re-examine the division of powers between the council and the state government. Mr Ghisingh?s demand that he be allowed to stay on as the council?s ?caretaker? before the next elections is clearly based on the practice of a chief minister continuing in such a capacity till a successor is elected. The idea may not pose a major problem, provided the relevant law is suitably amended. But it would be a different matter if Mr Ghisingh intends to use it to hold peace and democratic politics in Darjeeling to ransom. That would be a great betrayal of Darjeeling?s hard-won peace. Mr Bhattacharjee will, however, need to take New Delhi into confidence to work out his strategy for the council.

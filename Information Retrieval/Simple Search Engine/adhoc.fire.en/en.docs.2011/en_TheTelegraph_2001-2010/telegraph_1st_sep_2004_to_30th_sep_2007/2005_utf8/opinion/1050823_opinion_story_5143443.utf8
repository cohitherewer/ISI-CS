 GAZA IN REVERSE

 Over the last few days, the Gaza Strip has been history?s hall of mirrors. Within the larger history of displacements ? itself harking back to older episodes (and myths) of exodus and exile ? another set of displacements has been initiated in this territory, and nearly accomplished with unexpected swiftness. Jewish settlers who have built their homes and lives, from the late Sixties, on land claimed by Palestinians to be rightfully theirs are being moved out of Gaza by Israeli forces overseen by Mr Ariel Sharon. About 8,000 Jews will be moved out, forcibly if necessary, from the Strip and from isolated bits of the West Bank, and, if this goes well, perhaps from parts of east Jerusalem too. This withdrawal and handing over of the land to the Palestinian Authority would legally end the occupation of an estimated 1.4 million Palestinians. 

 Mr Sharon claims, however, that he has not been able to hold back tears while watching Jews evicting Jews, and there has been little violence but much histrionics during this withdrawal. Ultra-nationalist settlers have resisted eviction and held on to synagogues with some violence. Some have deliberately invoked scenes from the Holocaust, wearing the yellow Star of David and likening the Israeli forces to the Nazi oppressors. The media have also highlighted the pathos of these evictions, even though moderate Israeli voices have substantially supported the withdrawals, largely for the sake of peace, which the Palestinian extremists seem to have honoured so far. At one level, watched over by the United States of America, this is certainly a move towards the two-state solution, and thus a progress of sorts within the ?road map?. Yet, whether or not this move is strategic tokenism on the part of Mr Sharon will be clearer from the follow-up in the West Bank. The relative smoothness with which this withdrawal has been effected would make it difficult for Mr Sharon to make a case against continuing along this path. It would also encourage the Palestinian president, Mr Mahmoud Abbas, to rebuild his ravaged state on a foundation of peace and economic reconstruction.

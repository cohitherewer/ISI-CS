 Letters to Editor

 Birthday blues

 Sir ? I am in total agreement with Rudrangshu Mukherjee that there is nothing in Indira Gandhi?s childhood that makes her ?the most illustrious single girl child in our history? (?Singular girl child?, Nov 20). I would like to add that her lonely and unhappy childhood, perhaps in combination with her consciousness that despite her closeness to the powers-to-be in India, she did not have the calibre to be one of them, was responsible for her manifold abuses of power as prime minister. Let me cite an example. In 1958, during her tenure as the Congress working party president, Indira Gandhi visited Yale University and presented to the university a large portrait of Elihu Yale who was once a governor of Madras under the East India Company. As a Yale graduate student at that time, I had the opportunity to meet her in a reception held after she gave a talk on India?s first five-year plan. I complimented her for her excellent presentation and asked her why she did not make any mention of the problem of population emphasized in the first plan. After a brief pause, she said, ?Perhaps because I spent my childhood very lonely in a big house, it is difficult for me to visualize India as overpopulated?. 

 It is well known that during the Emergency, Indira Gandhi and her younger son, Sanjay, went overboard with population control and attempted to carry out a draconian sterilization programme. This contributed to her, and the Congress?s, defeat in the next elections. What is more unfortunate, the backlash generated by the forced sterilization programme continues to be the bane of the country?s population control programme.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Quite evidently, Rudrangshu Mukherjee is not pleased with the advertisement issued by the human resource development ministry on Indira Gandhi?s birthday which calls her the most illustrious single girl child in our history. But it is not clear why the author thinks that the ministry was behaving irresponsibly. Was it not this very woman who as a child did not shine academically or in any other field but went on to become one of the greatest leaders of independent India? There is no doubt that Mukherjee is well versed in Indira Gandhi?s life and I shall not argue with him on the former prime minister?s record at school and in Oxford. But by citing her example to the youth of our nation as a distinguished individual, how was the ministry wrong? Indira Gandhi?s childhood was spent under extraordinary circumstances in a politically charged atmosphere. If her formal education was disrupted, then the circumstances are to blame. Mukherjee will do well to remember that Rabindranath Tagore did not have school or college education either. 

 The author claims that young Indira was in no way creative. By pointing this out on her birthday, are we trying to prove that we are serving our youth by breaking myths? Also, Mukherjee?s comment that Indira Gandhi not growing up to be like her mother, Kamala Nehru, is India?s tragedy is in poor taste. Kamala Nehru?s soft nature also made her seem submissive and weak. Indira Gandhi?s personality was closer to her father, and that cannot be such a bad thing. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? I have excellent reason to remember Indira Gandhi?s Emergency, and I agree with most of what Rudrangshu Mukherjee says about it; but the statement that ?over her tenure as prime minister fell the shadow of the Emergency, the only threat to democracy that the Indian republic has had to suffer? has a fatal flaw. The word ?only? suggests that the raj of the sangh parivar not so long back was just another phase in our democratic process. I am one among many who dispute this.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? It is good that a critic and columnist of Rudrangshu Mukherjee?s stature has decided to speak candidly about the short-sighted folly of the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government. No doubt the advertisement issued by the HRD ministry was the fruit of a surfeit of love and respect for the departed leader. Although I agree with Mukherjee that it is unfair to select ?one single individual...as the most illustrious and distinguished single girl child from a span of more than 2,000 years of history?, but surely Indians were not so foolish as to elect thrice as prime minister such a flawed individual. I remember having met Indira Gandhi in September, 1970, at the peak of the Naxalite movement. She had said that such movements are the natural outcome of the state?s inability to provide jobs to the educated and food to the poor of the country. The author also holds Indira Gandhi responsible for the flourishing of the chamcha-culture, but I would say that it has been part of Indian culture since the days of the Ramayana.

 Yours faithfully,

 Race against time

 Sir ? Works of prose fiction are usually set in a particular time, space and social milieu. That enables us to learn about Russia from Dostoevsky, Birbhum-Murshidabad from Tarashankar or First World War Europe from Hemingway. Years and centuries later, several novels may read politically incorrect, but that in no way reduces their attractiveness as great literature. Enid Blyton provided a great source of enjoyment in our formative years, without television, mobile phones, or ipods. It is not fair to slap the xenophobic tag on her on the discovery of archival material so many years after the books were written (?Blyton, branded racist and rejected?, Nov 21). Xenophobia, in societies, takes bizarre shapes. During my childhood in the late Fifties, the ghoti?s (natives of West Bengal) dislike of immigrants from the then East Pakistan (bangaal) was very real. The cultural gap and animosity between ghotis and bangaals has nearly disappeared by now, and are only of academic interest. It is therefore better perhaps to ignore the hoopla about Blyton?s supposed ?racism? and allow it to die a natural death.

 Yours faithfully,

Chameli Pal, Batanagar

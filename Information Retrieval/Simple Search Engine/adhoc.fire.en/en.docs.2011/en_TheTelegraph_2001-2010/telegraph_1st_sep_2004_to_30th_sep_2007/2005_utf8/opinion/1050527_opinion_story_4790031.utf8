 WINNING STREAK

 Success or failure in elections is not entirely a matter of policies and performances. Increasingly, the polls have more to do with the strengths and weaknesses of contending parties and the related arithmetic. That this is so in Bengal much more than in other states has been proved yet again by the results of the civic polls. Its organizational strength gives the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) a huge advantage over its rivals. Add to this the blatant abuse of the administration and rampant electoral malpractices that the party is known for and the poll results offer no surprises. The promises of better civic governance form a small part of the story. But, if the CPI(M) knows how to win elections, its opponents seem to only know how to lose them. Thanks to their endless bickerings and mutual accusations, the people were never quite sure if they were more keen to fight each other than to challenge the CPI(M). Their talk of the need for a grand alliance to beat the Marxists was politically correct. At local levels, they even managed to forge such alliances along with the Bharatiya Janata Party. But, the idea never quite took shape as a major political vision or strategy. What stuck in the public mind was the image of an opposition in complete disarray.

 Yet, these civic polls were politically significant for two major reasons. First, they set the stage for next month?s elections to the Calcutta municipal corporation and then to the state assembly next year. The revolt of Calcutta?s mayor, Mr Subrata Mukherjee, against Ms Mamata Banerjee had also come weeks before the district polls. These were thus the opposition?s first opportunity in the changing situation to shape and test its strategy. It would be unusual if the dismal showing of the Trinamool Congress in these polls does not damage its prospects in the elections in Calcutta as well. Second, the civic polls were linked to the new trend of development politics in Bengal. The poll campaigns centred on development strategies for district towns. Since the Congress and the Trinamool too ran scores of civic bodies, they had no option but to join the left in the development debates. This development agenda will henceforth drive electoral politics. Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has made this his own brand of politics. He could depend on his party ? and divided opponents ? to make it a winning strategy.

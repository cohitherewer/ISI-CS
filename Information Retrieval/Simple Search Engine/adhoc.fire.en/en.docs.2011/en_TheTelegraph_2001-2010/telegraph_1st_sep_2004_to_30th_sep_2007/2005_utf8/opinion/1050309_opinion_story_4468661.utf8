 WHAT DO WOMEN REALLY WANT?

 SHOT IN THE DARK

 Shivaratri and International Women?s Day happened to fall on the same day yesterday

 Yesterday was International Women?s Day. By some bizarre quirk of fate, this year, March 8 also happened to be Shivaratri, the day when unmarried Hindu women worship Shiva in the hope of getting a husband like him (and the married, in the fond hope of keeping him). The sexual element of the worship ? since women actually pour water or milk over the model of an erect penis, a metonymy for the god himself ? has long been happily sublimated in spiritual fervour. But in our adolescence in Calcutta, friends caught in the act of observing Shivaratri would be roundly scorned and laughed at. International Women?s Day was not yet around to cheer the anti-Shivaratri masses.

 But Shivaratri has always been a major event on Calcutta?s religious calendar. Several girls? schools would remain closed the day after the puja, to give students, and teachers, respite after the previous day?s fast. Such schools usually had the vernacular as their medium of instruction, and many still continue with the old holiday routine. 

 Unlike Durga Puja and Holi, Shivaratri became a festival which middle-class, English-educated girls would not observe. We watched from our balconies as our domestic help, and those of the neighbouring houses, carried trays full of fruits and sweets to the local shibmandir. 

 Not so any more. The women who flock to the jewellery shops to celebrate Dhanteras also crowd the opulent marbled temples on Shivaratri. The tiny, local shibmandirs are still the haunts of our domestic helps, only the charms of Dhanteras are lost to them. 

 The fair devotees of Shiva, I have always been convinced, are blissfully ignorant of the origins and implications of their yearly ritual. Which is why, perhaps, retaliation has been scant in the face of a long tradition of hard-hitting feminist criticism of Shivaratri. I was struck by the absence of such criticism from the newspapers yesterday, but perhaps feminists have been too busy making arrangements for their own annual carnival.

 And then a friend pointed out that there is every likelihood of the same faces showing up at Women?s Day panel discussions on the right to abortion and skewed inheritance laws in the morning, and at the marbled prayer-houses at night. Another friend quipped that the coming together of the two events this year marks the near-divine confluence of all that we women individually stand for. 

 What do women stand for? And what do they want? One would expect a Women?s Day enthusiast?s answer to differ radically from a Shivaratri observer?s. And so, what happens when the two become one and the same person? Do we have a woman with at least two warring selves? Or one who can wear her multiple selves according to the demands of the occasion ? almost as Kim Novak slips from one man-ordained role to another in Hitchcock?s Vertigo. 

 There is no denying that International Women?s Day and Shivaratri are both part of women?s lives in the Calcutta of 2005. Is this a victory for the local-global feminist movement, or is it one of its great defeats? Who cares? As long as the women get together and have some fun.

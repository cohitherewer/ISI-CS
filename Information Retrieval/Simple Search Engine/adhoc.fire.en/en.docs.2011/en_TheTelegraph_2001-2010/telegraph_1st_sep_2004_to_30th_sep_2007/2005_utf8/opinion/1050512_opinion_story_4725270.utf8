 IT?S A THEME FOR A NEW DREAM 

 GOURI CHATTERJEE

 A team from Hindustan Times flew into the city last night. Someone from the still-unborn DNA will be here later this week. Times of India has already exported west its Calcutta resident editor to take charge of its embattled flagship there. The more the media Mahabharata hots up in Mumbai, the better it is to be a journalist and in Calcutta today. 

 There just aren?t enough journos in Mumbai to fill all those reams of newsprint the city?s many new and newly-revamped papers will soon be consuming. (Scribes there are going into deep depression if they don?t have an offer letter in their pocket that doubles their current salary.) Journalists who can ply their trade in the Queen?s language that is. 

 So they come, dangling their heavy purses and the lure of the bright lights, to Calcutta, for long the happy hunting ground for the all-India media. 

 We may crib about falling standards, they say the teaching of English is still the best here. We may lament the apoliticization of today?s kids, they say students here are far more aware than in any other metro. We may complain about our poor work ethics, the city?s go-getters have climbed media totem poles at breakneck speed. 

 The ?Calcutta mafia? already draws envious remarks from the older denizens of the Delhi press club. Let us hope, that will soon be the theme song of the better-heeled Mumbai press club too.

 Always at a loss

 Fat is becoming fashionable, at least in the world of Indian newspapers. ?Forty pages at least,? that?s what Mumbai?s new newspapers threaten to be. The day of obese American papers that denude huge forests everyday may soon be the order of our days.

 Is there really so much that is happening in the world everyday that we need to know to make sense of our lives? Maybe, maybe not. But only a fathead would think newspaper sizes have anything to do with news values.

 Like a menu in a multi-cuisine restaurant, newspapers these days have to have something for everyone, whether it is news or not. With so much served to them on one platter, readers are expected to have neither the time nor the appetite to pig out on any other paper, ensuring that rivals waste and wither away. 

 Of course, as long as the cover price remains low, the reader may refuse to be so frugal. So oversized papers may soon lead to a heavier cover price that may leave many unfulfilled. The battle of the bulge is just not winnable.

 Times are changing

 What a great paper the New York Times was. It dared to be serious when the rest of the world dumbed down with gusto. It dared to be liberal when the rest of America made that sound like something worse than a paedophile. It dared to stand for what it thought was right when the rest of the media rolled over to please the masses.

 But nothing is forever. The New York Times too is not immune to the pressure of a falling ? worse, sceptical ? readership. ?In order to build readers? confidence,? the paper is planning to ?increase our coverage of religion in America? and ?cover the country in a fuller way?, with more reporting from rural areas in the US, while also recruiting journalists who have military experience. In other words, precisely what the critics ordered. 

 Michael Wolff, the media columnist of Vanity Fair, put it so well. ?It will make the paper less interesting, less bold and more careful,? he has said. ?In its DNA the Times is accustomed to being loved and admired in every respect. This shows they are more worried about what people are thinking of us rather than what we think of ourselves.? Sad.

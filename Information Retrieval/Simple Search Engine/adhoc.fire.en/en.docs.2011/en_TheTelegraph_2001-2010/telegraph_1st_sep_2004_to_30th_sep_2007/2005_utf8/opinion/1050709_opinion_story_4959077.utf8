 Letters to Editor

 Added responsibility

 Sir ? The little insertion, ?Basu birthday? (July 8), was a surprise. Jyoti Basu has lived a full life and we wish him joyous existence for many more years to come. But since when have upcoming birthdays of ?has-been? politicians become news? Even the birthdays of Indian statesmen respected worldwide are not announced in advance in newspapers except as a paid advertisement. Why has The Telegraph then taken up the responsibility of publicizing the event on behalf of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) to whom Basu?s birthday will matter the most? 

 Yours faithfully,

 Kunal Saha, Ohio, US

 In black and white

 Sir ? ?Tax contract out on stars? (June 30) is shocking news. If actors in Maharashtra accept the policy, other state governments, particularly those in the South, will follow suit. The tax is bound to give a boost to the black market. If the intention is to make transactions in Bollywood more transparent, an added tax would hardly help. It will only lead to more evasions. The only people who would gain from it are income tax lawyers, who would be employed to devise ways to avoid the tax. 

 Jaya Bachchan has already indicated the way things are going to turn out. Many like her will now try to sign contracts outside Maharashtra. And why not? The stars contribute a lot to the generation of revenue for the state. This is hardly a way to treat them. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sumant Poddar, Calcutta

 Sir ? The reaction of the film industry to the newly imposed tax is surprising. Why do stars consider the tax to be a drain on their ?hard-earned? money? They earn a lot in comparison to the cheap entertainment they provide and they hardly ever spare a thought for the ?public? who make them famous. Why only films, even the television is today a source of easy money. The stars can jolly well cough up the tax. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shiv Shanker Almal, Calcutta

 Sir ? Imposing stamp duty on contracts of more than a lakh would certainly help the state government earn more revenue from the film industry. Given that the stars always manage to escape paying taxes, this is the least the government could do. The filmstars earn in crores, so a few hundreds will not burn a holes in their pockets. What is important is transparency in the collection of this tax. Otherwise, the tax will help promote the parallel economy. 

 Yours faithfully,

Payel Bhattacharyya, Calcutta

 Sir ? The .25 per cent tax on contracts that exceed rupees one lakh is too small a percentage for people who sometimes earn as much as Rs 10-20 crore annually. A justified range would have been 15-20 per cent. Perhaps the celebrities in Bollywood do not know that the poor denizens in West Bengal pay a 11.1 per cent stamp duty when they have to register property. 

 The reaction from the film world was startling, particularly Jaya Bachchan?s, who said that she will not oblige the government. Since she is a member of parliament, one would expect her to be more responsible. Suniel Shetty?s comment was no less interesting. He said that the ?whole black and white thing will happen again?, as if it is not happening already. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Chakraborty, Calcutta

 Sir ? There is no harm in extracting a few rupees from the fat wallets of celebrities, provided the government can ensure that the proceeds are utilized only for charity.

 Yours faithfully,

Salil Gewali, Shillong

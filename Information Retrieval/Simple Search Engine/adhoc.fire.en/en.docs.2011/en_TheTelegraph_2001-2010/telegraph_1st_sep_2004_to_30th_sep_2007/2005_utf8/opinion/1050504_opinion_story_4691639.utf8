 Letters to Editor

 Food for the eyes

 Sir ? Had he been alive, Charlie Chaplin would surely have relished the irony of the Nadia administration?s move to woo students ? for whom mid-day meals haven?t proved inducement enough to continue attending school ? with his films (?Chaplin to lure the kids?, April 27). It?s touching to see the administration, so utterly bankrupt in ideas otherwise, have faith in the transformative powers of culture. Only the uncharitable would say this was like Marie Antoinette telling starving Parisians ? if you don?t have bread, eat cakes. But at least the babus have the right ideas about ?culture?, and the poor kids are being shown Chaplin when they could well have been made to endure three hours of a Gurudakshina, or some such rubbish. Is Chaplin, however, suitable viewing for children? Or are the mandarins blind to the subversive underpinnings of Chaplin?s films? 

 Yours faithfully,

 Rina Sengupta, Calcutta

 Unkind cut

 Sir ? Sourav Ganguly has been dismissed by Rudrangshu Mukherjee on the basis of his performance in the last 25 matches he has played in (?More than just bad form?, April 25). But for a better evaluation of his achievements it would be better to look at his entire international career. 

 In tests, Ganguly ? who suppos edly can?t move his feet and hence, is vulnerable to swinging or seam ing deliveries ? averages 40.9 with 4,949 runs and 11 centuries. In one- dayers, even his harshest critics have to accept that with almost 10,000 runs, an average of 41.18 and 21 centuries, he has been one of the best in the last decade. Ganguly is now the most successful Indian captain in both forms of the game, by quite a margin. There were the series wins against Pakistan and Australia, successes in important one-day tournaments like the world cup and the Champions? Trophy, and the scintillating drawn series in Australia. Just one year of relatively flat performances does not invalidate the phenomenal progress the team has made under him. Compare the way the team used to meekly surrender closely fought matches in the Nineties, with how it has gone down fighting in the last few years. As for Ganguly?s alleged ethical violations, even his staunchest supporter will not claim that Ganguly plays cricket in the old gentlemanly way. Mukherjee praises Ricky Ponting and the Australian team for professionalism but forgets to mention that the latter have been the worst flouters of cricket ethics in recent times. In fact, the myth of the Australian cricketing machine partly owes its existence to a sheer bloody-minded competitiveness which thinks nothing of abusing opposition players and putting pressure on umpires. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Rudrangshu Mukherjee goes to great lengths to deflate Sourav Ganguly?s stature as a batsman. He needn?t have bothered because nobody rates Ganguly highly these days. His real strength lies in keeping together a flock of dispa-rate individuals, something whose worth can be appreciated if put against the miserable failure of the much-vaunted Sachin Tendulkar when he was on the job. Mukherjee also makes much of Ganguly?s waving his shirt on the Lords balcony. But he is strangely silent about a similar incident a few weeks prior to that, when a bare-bodied Andrew Flintoff had waved his shirt in Mumbai after forcing the series to a draw. If it was lack of ethics, it took place both ways. 

 Yours faithfully,

S.K. Das, Calcutta

 Sir ? It takes courage to go against popular opinion, as Rudrangshu Mukherjee does. He has voiced the feelings of many Indians, including some right-thinking Bengalis. Sourav Ganguly had done the country proud with his stellar performances in the late Nighties and early 2000. But his performance has nose-dived in the last three years. He has been given many a chance to improve, perhaps more than any other player. The team, which he is supposed to have put together, is in doldrums now due to his own poor form. Even the few successes the Indian team has achieved are owing to the performance of Dravid, Kumble and Sehwag. If Ganguly were to step down as a captain today, it will help him regain his lost glory. 

 Yours faithfully,

K. Giri, Calcutta

 Sir ? Whatever Rudrangshu Mukherjee may say, cricket lovers are aware of ICC rules regarding slow over rates and that umpires? decisions are final. But umpires can make mistakes, which is why the ICC itself has appointed third umpires. Match referees have often handed out punishments, which were later overturned by the ICC?s own appointees. Also, the ICC rules are not run specific. A team scoring 250 runs will take less time than a team scoring 300 runs especially if the extra 50 runs were taken in ones and twos. Also a team with more pacemen will take more time than those with more spinners. The basic premises of the ICC rules are unclear. Sourav Ganguly?s one-day record has fallen because of the fact that he has sacrificed his favourite opening spot. Even then, he had played some attractive cameos. Ganguly has learnt and changed a lot in his career. It is a matter of time before he returns to his prolific form

 Yours faithfully,

Indrajit Sardar, Calcutta

 Sir ? It?s really good to see that at long last a voice from Bengal offers some plainspeak on Sourav Ganguly. No one denies Sourav his glorious heydays, but what?s that today? His chronic failures these days, apparent loss of self-confidence, and intemperate behaviour ? causing annoyance to umpires by wilful infringement of cricketing rules and anorms of decorum that cricket is associated with ? are condemnable. I doubt whether any other captain, has been booked so many times. 

 Yours faithfully,

Asok Mukherjee, Erlangen, Germany

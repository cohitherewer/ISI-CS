 Letters to Editor

 Win-win situation

 Sir ? If it weren?t so poignant, because of the involvement of a month-old baby, the situation would have been almost funny (?Editor denies London liaison?, March 7). The British media turning on one from their own profession ? M.J. Akbar?s nationality gives him an added aura of Eastern mystique ? in their rapacious drive for sleaze. But Akbar has nothing to complain about. There is the ?damage? to his reputation, but at least his wife is ?more amused than angry?. There?ll be compensation enough if he can prove the allegations are false, and the whiff of scandal is enough to bring other recompenses ? invites to TV chat shows or to write columns, or even books. One would have thought it is because celebrities are involved that the British media play up these sexual intrigues. Or is it because they are involved in sexual intrigues that makes celebrities of the people involved?

 Yours faithfully,

G. Ramasamy, Calcutta 

 Man of action

 Sir ? It is unfortunate that the editorial, ?President and the people? (March 5), questions the role of the president in the Jharkhand issue. While A.P.J. Abdul Kalam is no constitutional expert, he is widely respected for his integrity. Kalam has demonstrated time and again that he is no puppet of the government in power. 

 Had Syed Sibtey Razi not acted in haste, Kalam would not have had to intervene. The governor flouted democracy and the Constitution when he refused to heed the undertaking given by the five independent MLAs that they supported the National Democratic Alliance. Knowing well that the United Progressive Alliance was not in a position to muster a majority, he invited Shibu Soren to form the government and gave him 21 days to prove his majority, thereby making room for horse-trading. It was this that compelled Kalam to summon him to Rashtrapati Bhavan. Moreover, the Constitution allows ordinary citizens to meet the president, so why should the BJP not parade its 41 MLAs before him? Had Kalam allowed his ?private anguish to be articulated in political action?, he would have recalled Razi. Instead, Kalam met the prime minister and the governor and gave the latter a patient hearing after which Razi decided to prepone the floor-test in the assembly. Kalam, in fact, performed a fine balancing act by gently snubbing the governor, and maintaining his own dignity as well.

 Yours faithfully,

Srinivasan Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? What should the president have done about Jharkhand instead? Should he have kept quiet now and talked about his anguish only after retirement, as K.R. Narayanan has done? In the eyes of the masses, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam has done the right thing. Had he not summoned the Jharkhand governor to New Delhi, the UPA would not have backtracked as it has now done.

 Yours faithfully,

K. Ramachandran, Santragachi 

 Sir ? ?President and the people? portrays the president as a figurehead whose only job is to cut a few ribbons or lay some foundation stones. Look at how K.R. Narayanan has lamented that he could not send troops to Gujarat during the post-Godhra riots because of the opposition of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee regime (?Narayanan bombshell?, March 2). Coming from the supreme commander of the armed forces of India, this is ridiculous. 

 Can a poor country like India afford such a costly symbol? Governors too are of no utilitarian value to the state. The Constitution, which has already been amended several times, can stand one more amendment to enable the abolition of such figureheads. I think A.P.J. Abdul Kalam is wasting his time and talent in the Rashtrapati Bhavan.

 Yours faithfully,

C.V.K. Moorthy, Calcutta

 Sir ? The Telegraph has always been supporters of the Nehru-Gandhi clan. But criticizing the actions of the president was a new low in sycophancy, because the president had put paid to the Congress?s malfeasance in Jharkhand. Is it your case that the ?dignity of the president?s office? would be enhanced if the incumbent were to turn a blind eye to gross injustice and the wilful destruction of ethics as was noticed, post-Godhra, in Gujarat?

 Yours faithfully,

Jayanta Dutt, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The editorial articulates what many right-thinking Indians think. It was indeed a sorry sight to see the president allowing Rashtrapati Bhavan to be used by the BJP to run a political circus with its leaders parading Jharkhand MLAs. The president should have restricted himself to receiving the delegation of BJP leaders and passing on his views to the cabinet, as per constitutional norms. He had no business to summon the Jharkhand governor. It is the BJP which, despite all its big talk, has mocked at democratic norms with its constant disruption of parliament. These acts show the desperation of the party which has been rejected by the people, to somehow get power in Jharkhand.

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

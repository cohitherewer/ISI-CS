 WORD AND EXISTENCE 

 Roberto Calasso is one of our few 

 remaining witnesses to that which cannot be appropriated, 

 says Pratap Bhanu Mehta 

 Ancient wisdom 

 It is often said that the true 

 mark of a great writer is his ability to create a completely 

 new genre. By this reckoning, Roberto Calasso can surely 

 lay claim to being one of the world?s greatest living writers 

 in every sense of that impoverished word. While the nature 

 of Calasso?s overall achievement is not easy to describe, 

 because so much of it depends upon the force of his own 

 words, there has seldom been a writer whose every word is 

 a revelation. I first stumbled upon Calasso accidentally. 

 I had always thought that Marxist critics had never given 

 Max Stirner his due. 

 Stirner was the only one of Marx?s 

 adversaries who seemed to have gotten under his skin. Marx 

 was too much of a genius not to recognize the intellectual 

 threat that Stirner posed to his project. Marx had himself 

 made a career out of showing that all thought prior to Marx 

 was a form of reification, an idolatry of concepts that 

 kept humanity in awe, but disguised reality. But Stirner?s 

 delirious invocation of an ideal of personal autonomy, where 

 the subject could stand and oppose everything, was a turning 

 of tables on Marx himself. For one thing, Stirner?s position 

 entailed that there was no such thing as a politics without 

 remainders. Something of the Self is always abridged in 

 any attempt to articulate the meaning of existence. The 

 Marxist hope that all contradictions could ultimately be 

 reconciled was as much a delusion as any that he had exposed. 

 Stirner came too close to exposing Marx?s game. His claim 

 that there was a Self that could always stand outside any 

 appropriation into State, History or Progress doomed the 

 modern project.

 For someone with an amateur interest 

 in Stirner, there was not much to go on. And that was the 

 moment at which The Ruin of Kasch, Calasso?s most 

 enigmatic book, fell into my hands. The book not only had 

 some of the best pages on Marx and Stirner that I had ever 

 encountered, but it used this debate as a template to throw 

 light on modernity itself. It characterized modernity as 

 an attempt to do things: one erase the surplus of existence, 

 and bring it all under a controllable form. This vainglorious 

 hope of a sacrifice without a residue, and therefore a sacrifice 

 that does not recognize itself as such, was at the heart 

 of the modern project. To simplify considerably, moderns 

 are unaware of all that precedes their own success. Unlike 

 ancient sacrifices that constantly kept in view the fact 

 that a sacrifice was taking place, with blood and victims 

 and all, modern sacrifices, in all the political forms they 

 take, deny their own sacrificial character. But what is 

 expunged from the modern consciousness returns to haunt 

 it in a more pathological form. Modernity?s bloody history 

 is not something modernity can acknowledge or fathom in 

 its own terms.

 To reduce Calasso?s work to a 

 doctrine is to caricature it. The precision of Calasso?s 

 language, his ability to bring to light the shared assumptions 

 behind seemingly disparate doctrines, and his sheer originality 

 make him a thinker of unparalleled power. This is a writer 

 for whom each word matters. He is one of the few writers 

 each of whose sentences is a profound metaphysical thriller: 

 an entr?e into an absolutely astonishing question 

 that ends with an equally surprising answer. It is something 

 of a clich? to say that language reveals. Calasso is the 

 only writer I know of who has taken this thought literally 

 and seriously, where the interface between two words can 

 reveal a network of existential connections. His sentences 

 are worth more than most books. Take his meditation on the 

 connection between ?law? and ?order? and their mediation 

 through sacrifice. ?Order is what law, on its own, cannot 

 achieve.... (O)rder is law plus sacrifice, the perpetual 

 supplement, the perpetual extra that must be destroyed so 

 that order can exist. The world cannot live by law alone, 

 because it needs order that law alone is unable to provide. 

 The world needs to destroy something to make order; and 

 it must destroy it outside the law, with pleasure, with 

 hatred, with indifference.? There is a no more succinct 

 articulation of the central problem of political philosophy.

 Precisely because Calasso takes 

 words seriously, he is the most penetrating reader I know. 

 Both his recreations of what we think of as Greek and Hindu 

 mythology in The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony and 

 Ka are philosophically acute and philologically accurate. 

 But equally his book on Kafka and the astounding Literature 

 and the Gods are an account of the always tense wrestling 

 between the world and word. How does presence erupt through 

 literature? 

 But is this question even intelligible 

 to an age in thrall of two positions without a residue? 

 ? a nominalism that threatens to sever the link between 

 the word and the world from one direction. This is a doctrine, 

 most radically prefigured in the Buddha, that will not recognize 

 any constraint or limit, where the world acts as no prohibition 

 on language because the world does not exist at all. On 

 the other hand, there was the fleeting moment of scientism 

 that did away with the relationship between the world and 

 the word by denying that there was any problem of representation. 

 The world in that becomes everything, language nothing; 

 literature in the true sense of the word becomes impossible.

 In part, Calasso?s work is elegiac, 

 like Wittgenstein, only too powerfully aware that it risks 

 being misunderstood. Calasso, like Wittgenstein, has experimented 

 with a new genre that defies convention and made it all 

 his own, precisely because convention has become so unaware 

 of its own presuppositions that to say anything using them 

 is almost impossible. How does one write a book that can 

 reflect the creativity of existence itself? Calasso is often 

 described as a thinker who thinks in stories not in arguments. 

 But nothing could be farther from the truth. He is not a 

 story-teller precisely because stories have ceased to reveal: 

 they have become what we name them: fiction.

 But philosophy as well is no longer 

 possible, a victim of its own claim that it would be self-grounded, 

 not grounded by existence. It was precisely such a dilemma 

 that led Plato to use ?myth? to reveal the truth no story 

 can, and make the argument no philosophy is able to without 

 subverting itself. Hence Calasso has been searching for 

 what he somewhere calls ?absolute literature? that does 

 not dissolve reality into mere story, but can articulate 

 the layers of our existence. This is idea of literature 

 as meditation, as a medium of access to something that reminds 

 us that we moderns, contrary to our claims, are not the 

 ground of our own being.

 Calasso has this effect where 

 readers come away admiring the clarity of each individual 

 sentence. There is nothing obscure in Calasso?s writing 

 though there is a phenomenal scholarship few can match. 

 But asked to recreate the meaning of his whole oeuvre, 

 anyone would hesitate: what does this all add up to? 

 But in forcing this question upon 

 us, Calasso again reminds us of the layers of paradox that 

 enfold us. As he writes about India: ?Every true philosopher 

 thinks but one thought; the same can be said of a civilization.? 

 The central insight of Indian civilization is that something 

 ?only exists if consciousness perceives it as existing. 

 And if a consciousness perceives it, within that consciousness 

 there must be another consciousness that perceives the consciousness 

 that perceives.? But then any attempt to abridge this complexity 

 and cut the Gordian knot of existence, whether exemplified 

 in Buddha?s radical attempts, or Marx?s more deluded ones, 

 will only disenchant the world. It will not answer what 

 it all adds up to. Calasso reminds us what the an- cients 

 knew: not everything can be appropriated. He is one of our 

 few remaining witnesses to that which cannot be appropriated.

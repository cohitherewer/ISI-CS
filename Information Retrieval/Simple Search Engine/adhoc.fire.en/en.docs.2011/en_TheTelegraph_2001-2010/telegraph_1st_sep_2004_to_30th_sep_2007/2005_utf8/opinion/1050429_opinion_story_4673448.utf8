 IT?S ALL IN THE MIND

 Hitler?s army bogged down in Stalingrad

 COMMAND FAILURE IN WAR: PSYCHOLOGY AND LEADERSHIP

 By Robert Pois and Philip Langer,

 Indiana, $ 22.95

 Carl Von Clausewitz claims that all great commanders display a ?genius for war?. The elements of this genius include courage, bravery, foresight and endurance. How do some leaders display more of these qualities than others? Norman Dixon in On the Psychology of Military Incompetence points out that bad commanders display traits like failure to think properly under stress, nervousness, rigidity, and so on. In this volume, Robert Pois, a professor of history, and Philip Langer, a professor of educational psychology, point out that even so-called great commanders betrayed these negative traits at different points in their careers.

 They select eight such ?great? commanders. There is a comparison of the two German warlords, Frederick the Great and Hitler. Both were defeated decisively by the Russians ? Frederick at Kunersdorf in 1759 and Hitler at Stalingrad in 1942. Both underestimated Russia?s military potential. For Pois and Langer, the explanation for this lies in their troubled childhood.

 Frederick and Hitler were brought up in strong patriarchal households and as children, were abused by their fathers. According to the authors, Frederick and Hitler transferred the hatred they felt for their father onto Russia. Hence, it was emotionally impossible for both to realistically assess Russia?s strength. And to stem their helplessness in the face of fear, they pursued a ruthlessly aggressive policy. 

 However, there were differences in the mental make-up of the two. Frederick?s army was actually created by his father. So, assert Pois and Langer, he hated his army and was indifferent to the heavy losses it suffered against the Russians at Kunersdorf. 

 Hitler too was indifferent to his army?s sufferings, but for different reasons. Poise and Langer explain the Fuehrer?s behaviour in terms of the frustration-aggression cycle. Hitler was frustrated in his bid to destroy Russia. To his mind, the causes of his frustration were the German generals and soldiers of the Wehrmacht. Thus, he decided to punish them. Hence, Hitler?s order to the Sixth Army at Stalingrad to fight to the last man with the last bullet.

 The refusal to face reality was not confined to the Germans. The Confederate commander, Robert E. Lee, wanted to believe that the Union Army was finished. Hence, in 1863, he launched repeated assaults against the well defended Union positions in Gettysberg. Similarly, Douglas Haig did not want to see the reality of trench warfare. So, he did not visit the trenches or think about his soldiers who had to face the horror of it in 1915-16 in France.

 From this book it would seem that all military geniuses were troubled and in need of therapy. But how good are psychoanalytic tools to analyze the minds of men long dead?

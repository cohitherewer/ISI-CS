 WORK WISE

 Logic is relentless. A cleaning-up of the electoral system ? or at least the intention to do so ? would logically mean the cleaning up of all elections. College and university elections show exactly the same symptoms of corruption as do the elections to the Lok Sabha and the assemblies. That is hardly surprising, for elections to student unions are viewed as ? even expected to be ? an apprenticeship for a bigger political career ahead. Not all student leaders graduate into political bigwigs, but for the number that does, student leadership is considered an extra feather. Different political parties dominate student unions in different regions. The relationship is fruitfully symbiotic: political parties are as interested to have assured entry into college and university politics as the student leaders are to gain patronage, power and a promising option for the future.

 The level of political involvement is easily assessed by an observation of the primacy of the Students? Federation of India in the institutions of West Bengal, for example. As long as the central concerns of union elections in colleges and universities are not academic, environmental and developmental, they will remain a practice-ground for future strokes for a select few. The Supreme Court has taken on the issue at the behest of a petition by a university in Kerala, and has directed that a committee be formed to begin cleaning up student elections. This is really not a task for the judiciary, yet, once again, abdication of responsibility by the administrators concerned has left a vacuum. While transparency and fairness are the keynotes of any democratic process, student elections demand a further step to be properly reformed. As long as organized students? bodies are directly linked to political parties, there will always remain questions about their central concerns. The aim of a student union is not to train better workers for the victorious political party, but to ensure greater academic achievements and improved academic policy and environment, especially a violence-free environment. The best student leaders would be those whose concerns and abilities match these demands. Since the court-directed committee is just being formed, its aims are not quite clear. But freeing student unions from the dominance of party politics would be a perfectly reasonable goal.

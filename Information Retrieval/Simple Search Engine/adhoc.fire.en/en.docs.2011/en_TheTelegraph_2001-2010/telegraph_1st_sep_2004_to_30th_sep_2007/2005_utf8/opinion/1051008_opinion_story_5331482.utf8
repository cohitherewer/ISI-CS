 PARTY AND AFTER

 Politics of the day often obscures more fundamental issues. Politicians in India may not look beyond the next election, but the Supreme Court?s judgment on the dissolution of the Bihar assembly has a much wider context than the coming polls in the state. The judgment is not entirely unpredictable nor is its impact on the polls difficult to measure. It confirms what seemed pretty obvious ? that the recommendation of the governor, Mr Buta Singh, to dissolve the House had been more political than constitutional. It was also widely anticipated that the court might not interfere with the electoral process that the Election Commission had begun with the notification of the polls. A worse constitutional crisis could have followed if the court ruled in favour of the restoration of the dissolved assembly, for that would have stalled the polls and thereby interfered with the EC?s work. The ruling thus comes as a practical step that combines a moral censure of the governor?s conduct and an endorsement of the people?s right to elect a government of their choice. It also questions the Centre?s role behind the governor?s action. Neither the Union government nor the Congress-led ruling coalition can absolve itself of the responsibility for the Bihar fiasco. The Bharatiya Janata Party and its partners in the National Democratic Alliance are understandably upbeat about the verdict. Coming a day after the attack on the BJP leader, Mr Ravi Shankar Prasad, the judgment will strengthen the NDA?s case for freeing Bihar from the anarchy of the long reign of Mr Laloo Prasad Yadav and his wife, Ms Rabri Devi. 

 But the issues that the judgment raises are important for the entire system. Once more, the action of a governor points to a systemic flaw that is ominous for a democracy. It cannot be a healthy system that leaves the people?s mandates to the discretion of an individual. In fact, this is a sure recipe for both political instability and money-powered politics. The verdict should inspire a serious intellectual debate as to how to mend this absurd system. The problem is that this fundamental question does not seem to worry the political parties. The reason is not difficult to see. Both the Congress and the BJP are guilty of using governors for their own interests. Even in Bihar, the previous NDA government had tried to use a former party leader-turned-governor, Mr S.S. Bhandari, to dismiss Mr Yadav?s government in 1999. 

 The apex court?s verdict may have embarrassed the Congress; but the NDA government too did nothing to change the laws in order to free the governor?s office from the pressures of partisan politics. It is time the government and the parties seriously discussed the idea of not only having non-political persons as governors but also minimizing their role in government-formation. Raj Bhavans must no longer be places for closet politics.

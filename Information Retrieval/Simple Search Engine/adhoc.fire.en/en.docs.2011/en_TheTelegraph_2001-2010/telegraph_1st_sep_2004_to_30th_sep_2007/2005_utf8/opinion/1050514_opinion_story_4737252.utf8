 Out and About

 Kitty party ladies with bulging waistlines might get excited by the title of Upamanyu Chatterjees forthcoming novel. Being published by Penguin and likely to hit the book stores later this year, its called Weight Loss. Chatterjees insiders view of the Indian bureaucracy has often resulted in warm and amusing fiction in the past. But this novel, in the words of the 46-year-old writer-bureaucrat himself, is about sexual and spiritual degradation. A kind of raunchy Agastya meets Osho, eh?

 They come in all shapes and sizes ? idols, that is ? but all of them finally turn out to have feet of clay. Take Paula Abdul, for instance. The singer and American Idol judge is in the middle of a dirty-linen washing ritual after former Idol contestant Corey Clark claimed that Paula had had a cosy affair with him and offered him tips on how to crack the contest hurdles. Of course, Paula, like the demure maiden she is, has swooned and denied the sordid affair. Last heard, Clark was going around saying that he has incriminating evidence on the bedtime story. Stay put for more updates...

 Dont be surprised if Durham 

 University soon starts a course in quirky writing. For, 

 Bill Bryson is its new chancellor. Which only proves that 

 the dry-humoured British will do anything to encourage the 

 return of a native. Especially since he now comes with an 

 American tang.

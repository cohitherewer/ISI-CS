 PRICE OF PURITY

 Calcutta is not known for its respect for history. By upholding the ruling of the Calcutta high court with regard to an admission fee for entry into the grounds of the Victoria Memorial, the Supreme Court has ensured protection for this pocket of history. But the glorious or inglorious past was not the crux of the decision. The entry fee debate had originated in the newly-felt need to maintain the green stretch in the heart of the city, that is, the Maidan and everything it contains. The army, responsible for the Maidan, insists that fairs and exhibitions should not be held there because of the havoc wreaked by milling crowds, temporary stalls and the enormous waste each fair entails. An entry fee for the Victoria Memorial grounds has much to recommend it. Clearance of waste, protecting trees and plants and general maintenance of the beautiful surroundings of the historical monument all need money that can be recovered from visitors. 

 But it is not Victoria Memorial alone that will generate revenues at the gate. The new Eliot Park will do so too, while the Eden Gardens has been closed to visitors wishing to relax among its plants and pagoda because the army has refused the forest department?s demand for an entry fee. The principle behind entry fees must be carefully laid down. If it is the logic of enclosure, that is, encircling and beautifying sections of the green so that only those who can pay will breathe its pure air, then it is doubtful that the lungs of Calcutta can be shared by all its inhabitants. The same logic that helps preserve history in one pocket may destroy it in others. The forest department?s contention that an entry fee is a bar to criminals seems strangely innocent. Criminals can pay when retired persons and youngsters out for a game of cricket may not be able to. Maintenance of common land has a lot to do with cooperation and awareness. The logic of an entry fee for the Victoria Memorial grounds cannot apply everywhere.

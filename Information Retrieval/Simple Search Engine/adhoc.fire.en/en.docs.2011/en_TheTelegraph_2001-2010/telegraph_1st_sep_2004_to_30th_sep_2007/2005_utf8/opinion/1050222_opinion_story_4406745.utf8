 SAVAGE GARDEN

 It is always difficult to explain extreme forms of violence. The ghastly killing of a tea-garden owner, who was set ablaze by workers in Assam?s Golaghat district, is a case in point. Neither the problems of Assam?s tea industry nor militant trade unionism can quite explain the brutality. It is easier, though, to understand the fear that has gripped the industry after the murder in the garden. If some two dozen senior executives have fled the gardens in the upper Assam districts of Tinsukia, Dibrugarh and Sivsagar, they obviously have little faith in the government?s ability to protect them. Not that the government was unaware of the sense of insecurity with which owners and managers lived in many of the gardens. Violent incidents in the recent past should have forewarned the mandarins in Dispur. It is a pathetic example of the smugness that plagues India?s officialdom that the government is now talking of drawing up a ?list of sensitive? gardens. It was no use for the government to have known of the situation in the garden in Golaghat if it did little to prevent the brutal murder of the owner. That the victim was the son of a former Congress minister highlights the industry?s insecurity and the government?s inefficiency. 

 True, the industry too has its share of failures. A large number of tea gardens in Assam have failed to pay wages to the workers on time. Apparently, the industry?s argument that it is passing through a financial crisis has not convinced the workers. Also, rising costs and falling profits have forced most garden-owners to withdraw or suspend many of the benefits that they used to provide the workers. The All Assam Tea Tribes Students Association has recently threatened to complain to the National Human Rights Commission about the lack of medical facilities in the gardens which, they claim, led to the death of 1,500 workers last year. But the blame is also at the government?s door. But none of the problems and failures of the industry can justify the horrific act at Golaghat. The association and other trade unions have condemned it, but that does little to wash their crime in fomenting persistent labour unrest that leads to such tragedies. Unfortunately, the ruling Congress too has often connived at the labour militancy because the tea-workers are traditional supporters for the party. But Assam?s sick tea gardens are dangerous places for party games.

 CHOOSING RIGHT

 Could human ethics vary according to context? Crucial questions of right and wrong may be debated and legislated in different societies in different ways. Britain and India are both democracies that are confronting the multifarious ethical complexities of the free market. If the decision to go to war did not leave the British people with much of a choice, then choosing the sex of their offspring could well become a real option for them in certain circumstances. A Commons select committee report has recommended that British couples undergoing in vitro fertilization treatment should be allowed to select their child?s sex if they want to ?balance? their family. The committee of parliamentarians is split down the middle on this issue. The opposing MPs feel that it is a ?Frankenstein report? that ignores the dignity of human life, paving the way for dangerous imbalances in British demography. They are backed by Catholic and Church-of-England leaders. Those who support the recommendation point out that only a small minority of British people would wish to avail themselves of sex selection, and there is no evidence that this would have an adverse outcome on a family or would change the balance of the population. Most opposing views have cited the examples of female infanticide in India and China.

 It is true that such a proposition would sound dangerous, even obscene, in India, given the stark gender imbalances at every level of rural and urban society. An open debate on the issue ? in parliament and in civil society ? thus comes close to being taboo. Yet, in Britain, even the most vociferous opponents, such as the churches, have asked for a broader public debate that would not dismiss the idea as beyond consideration. The decision must be founded on widespread public consensus, and the nature of this consensus should not be taken for granted in a free society. Those who fear the ?libertarian? approach of this report do so because it identifies parental decision-making with consumer choice: children should not be reduced to ?customized personal accessories?. From the perspective of achieved gender justice, this is a radically different society from India or China, expressing its sense of affluent outrage with what it perceives as unprincipled consumerism. To say that sex selection is wrong because it reduces parenting to ?lifestyle choices? would sound ridiculous in India.

 TURN AWAY FROM THE MIDDLE PATH

 Up in arms

 Buddha?s Warriors By Mikel Dunham, Penguin, Rs 450

 Six brawny Tibetans, dressed clumsily in calf-length lunghis, set out from Kalimpong in north Bengal one winter night to meet an American who waits for them in a village across the border between India and East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). Joined by the American, the first they ever met, and Pakistani guards, they travel long on a train and finally reach an airport, from where an American military plane flies them to Okinawa in Japan. 

 From Okinawa, another plane takes them to the island of Saipan, where Roger E. McCarthy of the CIA?s Tibetan task force receives them. Six months later, the first of the CIA-trained leaders of the Tibetan resistance movement are flown back and parachuted into Tibet to organize the battle to drive out the Chinese from their homeland. 

 For nearly two decades, neither the Chinese nor the American public had any clue to the CIA?s Tibetan operations. Even the government of India was mostly in the dark for several years after the operation had begun in 1957. 

 Books have been written since on the CIA-backed Tibetan freedom movement. Dunham?s account would, therefore, be familiar stuff to those interested in the subject. But that takes nothing away from the pleasure of reading this book. It remains a fascinating account of the brief history of the Tibetan movement and not merely of the CIA?s involvement in it. Its refreshingly authentic quality derives primarily from the interviews the author had had over seven years with leaders of the uprising, other key players, McCarthy and other CIA officers and with the Dalai Lama himself. 

 The interviews, which are quoted at length throughout the book, give a local flavour and a human face to the account. The result is a happy mix of the styles of a travelogue and of political commentary. Dunham?s sympathies are obviously with the Tibetans. But that does not prevent him from recording the downside of the Tibetan story. 

 The book is basically an account of the heroic battles that the warrior-tribes of Kham, Amdo and Golok in eastern Tibet waged against the Chinese. They had grouped themselves into an organized movement called Chushi-Gangdruk and fought fiercely even before the CIA appeared on their horizon. They were joined by hundreds of Buddhist monks who discarded their monastic robes and vows of non-violence. As he records their heroic deeds, Dunham also presents the seamy side ? of Tibetans who collaborated with the Chinese for money, other favours or simply out of cowardice. To the warriors of freedom, it was not just their country that was under siege; they saw the Chinese invasion of Tibet as an attack on their religion, their culture and above all, their god-king, the Dalai Lama himself. 

 The author takes us through different locales of the movement ? within Tibet, in Mustang in western Nepal, where the last CIA-backed camp was set up, and, of course, on distant shores like Camp Hale in the Colorado Rockies, the Tibetan fighters? training site on American soil. Dunham does not share, however, the belief that the CIA was involved in the Dalai Lama?s escape from Lhasa in 1959.

 But a CIA-backed armed insurgency is also a matter of international politics. The Cold War compulsions, new frontiers for American operations in Korea and Vietnam, the changed priorities of the White House and finally, the Nixon administration?s momentous decision to go for a rapprochement with Beijing worked together to signal the end of the CIA?s ? and America?s ? Tibet mission. Dunham?s Tibetan story is set also in the larger frame of changing world politics. Years later, the Americans would rediscover Tibet ? through Hollywood films on the Dalai Lama. But that is another story.

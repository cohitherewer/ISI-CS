 Book Briefs

 Across a narrow sea

 A History of Sri lanka 

 By K.M. de Silva, 

 Penguin, Rs 650

 This is a fully revised edition of a standard scholarly account of Sri Lanka, from the first Indo-Aryan colonizers and settlers to the LTTE breaking away from the talks, in 2003, with the Ranil Wickremesinghe government. ?The moral of the story,? de Silva concludes, ?so far as the Sri Lankan case is concerned, is that radicalization of Tamil politics makes the search for a negotiated settlement a much more difficult exercise than it was in the years before the LTTE established its dominance in Tamil politics in Sri Lanka.? This account covers the country?s development from a classical Buddhist society and irrigation economy, to its emergence as a tropical colony producing some of the world?s most important cash crops (cinnamon, tea, rubber, coconut), and finally as an Asian democracy. It is a study of the political vicissitudes of Sri Lanka?s ancient civilization and the successive phases of Portuguese, Dutch and British colonial rule, ending with the unfortunate consequences of becoming a centre of ethnic tension. This is a basic reference source for students of ancient, colonial and postcolonial societies, ethnic conflict and democratic transitions.

 Texts that dazzle

 Her-Self: Early Writings on Gender By Malayalee Women, 1898-1938 Translated from the Malayalam and edited 

 by J. Devika, 

 Stree, Rs 450

 This is an important and spirited anthology of source-texts, translated into English for the first time, that helps the social historian historicize Indian vernacular ?feminism? in a more nuanced manner, indeed to question the category itself. It brings together the polemical as well as personal reflections of educated women thinking and writing in Malayalam, and participating in the public discourse about their own lives, bodies and destinies. V. Geetha, in her foreword, calls it a collection of ?texts that dazzle?. Even when the traditional gendered divisions of labour remain more or less in place, what begins to emerge in these texts is the identification of the ?Womanly? with a certain kind of power and not with an inflexibly demarcated domestic space. Marriage and dowry are contested and rejected, venerable judges refuted, and the 18-year-old Haleema Beevi had organized a conference of about two hundred women, as women?s capacities are being put to test in schools, hospitals, philanthropic institutions and local political bodies. 

 India deserves a livelier book

 Handbook of urbanization in india: an analysis of trends and processes

 By K.C. Sivaramakrishnan, Amitabh Kundu and B.N. Singh,

 Oxford, Rs 550

 The scope of this study is to obtain a proper understanding of the extent, patterns and trends as well as the socio-economic and spatial characteristics of urbanization in India. The objective is to assess better the nature of the policies and programmes required for urban governance and the development and management of urban areas. The Census 2001 is the main source of data for this study, supplemented by the Economic Census and the National Sample Survey. It could have been written less dully, given the interestingness of the subject.

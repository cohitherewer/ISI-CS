 Criminals about town

 Sir ? Calcutta, the city of joy? The city of lawlessness, more likely. The incidents of Sunday morning in Salt Lake reveal the true state of the security system in the city (?Rape and rampage by city robbers?, July 25). If all it takes for an area to plunge into lawlessness and a free-for-all for criminals is the police patrol to move out, why not make provisions for round-the-clock security? Is there a dearth of police personnel? Absolutely not. But the problem is that all of them have been assigned to guard the VIPs. Who cares for the ordinary people? Now after the crime, the police will become alert and beef up security for a few days. But after some time, they will become careless again. 

 Yours faithfully,

Debasmita Chakravarty, Calcutta

 Sir ? Salt Lake is increasingly becoming a haven for criminals. What is shocking is that after a number of headline-grabbing incidents, nothing much is being done to keep crime in check. The authorities seem entirely complacent. Perhaps they are doing what they are best at ? keeping silent until the next crime occurs. The policing too leaves a lot to be desired. The patrol teams are obviously not doing their duty. When a crime occurs they wake up from their slumber but immediately after, it?s back to square one. However, its not just the negligence of the police but also the nonchalance, at the political and administrative level, that is making Salt Lake increasingly vulnerable to crime. The transfer of efficient and honest police officers is an indication of the authorities? insouciance. Old couples feel unsafe and women hesitant to venture out in the dark. Sector 5 in Salt Lake is projected as the IT destination of West Bengal. But if security deteriorates any further, Salt Lake may suffer when it comes to investment. Measures need to be taken to tighten security in this township before it?s too late. This is not the time for rhetoric.

 Yours faithfully,

Koyel Basu, Calcutta

 Sir ? Many houses in Salt Lake have their doors barred and windows shut even during the day. Such is the residents? fear of being burgled. They have become even more careful these days since burglaries are being reported more frequently of late. The problem becomes worse after dark, since the area is poorly lit. The authorities should do away with bulbs and tube-lights and install mercury lights. Also, the residents should be encouraged to have addas in the open and police posted at the entry to every block to check all passers-by, if required by blocking the road between 12-6 am. In case of burglary, an alarm should be rung so that all houses in the neighbourhood wake up and the culprits are caught. 

 Yours faithfully,

Rakesh Bhatia, Calcutta 

 Sir ? When robbers can burgle four houses one after another and then rape a minor girl ? with the police being in the dark all the while ? one can safely conclude that the area is in the grip of criminals. Citizens should do more to prevent such crimes, especially since both public and private security measures are proving to be unreliable.

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Sir ? What is the police doing in Calcutta? It seems people aren?t safe even in their own houses, leave alone walking down an isolated road. When a minor is raped in front of her parents, what can be worse? With our prosecution system being the way it is, it can?t be said with any certainty that the criminals will get their just desert, which would mean being locked away for a long time. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sumant Poddar, Calcutta

 Mourning holiday 

 Sir ? As a humble citizen of this country, I have the highest regard for the parliament, its honourable members and functionaries. I also feel profoundly sad at the deaths of some of these distinguished members of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha since parliament met last. Yet, I cannot but insist that the parliament need not adjourn for the whole day ? as it did on July 25 ? in memory of the departed MPs. That is excessive waste of time for the highest legislative body of the largest democracy in the world. 

 Yours faithfully,

S.C. Kapoor, Noida

 Sir ? Adjourning parliament for an entire day as a sign of respect for dead MPs goes against the interests of the nation. It is the same in courts where the death of a lawyer or a judge is enough for it to be declared a holiday. Schools and colleges too declare holidays for the same reason. Parliamentarians can take the first step in ending this practice.

 Yours faithfully,

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? Why not observe silence for two minutes out of respect for dead parliamentarians, leaving the rest of the first day of the session for normal legislative business? Each day of parliament costs the nation a large sum. If such ?mourning-holidays? are to continue, then parliamentarians must stop being paid their allowance for such days!

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

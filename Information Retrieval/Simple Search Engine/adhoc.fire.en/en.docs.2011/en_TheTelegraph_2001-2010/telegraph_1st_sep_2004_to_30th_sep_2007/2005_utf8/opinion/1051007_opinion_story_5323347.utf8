 DEBRAHMANISING HISTORY: DOMINANCE AND RESISTANCE IN INDIAN SOCIETY By Braj Ranjan Mani, Manohar, Rs 895

 Indian nationalist leaders of the 19th century were probably echoing the Orientalists who, in the late 18th century, first began singing the glories of ancient Indian culture. Discourses on Hinduism have abounded since then, but they have got a second wind in the Nineties with the saffron brigade seeking to militarize Hinduism, or Hindutva as it was branded.

 The Orientalists, the nationalists and the Hindutvawadis may have had very different political agendas, but they were agreed that Indianness was co-terminous with Vedic-Brahminic Hinduism. They had an exaggerated belief in the superiority of Hinduism, an attitude which Tagore, as well as Dalit revolutionaries like B.R. Ambedkar, Jyotiba Phule, Ramaswamy Periyar and Swami Acchutanand, had criticized.

 Braj Ranjan Mani?s Debrahmanising History accommodates all the politically charged polemic on Hinduism. He highlights the oppressively rigid caste-hierarchy of Hinduism and takes stock of the counter-hegemonic forces operating within. This is a ?history from below? which records the Buddhist challenge to the Brahminic social order and the resultant Brahminic backlash, the contribution of the saint-poets of the Nirguna Bhakti movement (Kabir, Ravidas, Tukaram and so on) in promoting egalitarianism within Hinduism, and also the elitist caste and feudal bias of the Indian nationalist movement. Mani also sums up the reformatory activities of some Dalit leaders and the Gandhi-Ambedkar debate on caste.

 Mani?s attack on the tyrannies of Brahminism is mostly well-founded, but it is not always critically nuanced or penetrating. If the Orientalist-nationalist interpretation of Hinduism is blinkered, then Mani?s analysis shows up a different bias, a failure to recognize the different layers of Hinduism. Also, for the last two millennia Hinduism, unlike Christianity and Islam, has not indulged in expansionism and has been fundamentally inclusive of other religions, even Buddhism.

 Mani also undermines the anti-casteist thrust of the Saguna Bhakti movement, passing over the Chaitanya-Haridas episode. His estimate of nationalist leaders like B.G. Tilak, Swami Vivekananda, M.K. Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and others is too general and simplistic. Clubbing them in a single elitist group is ignoring the subtleties in their individual response to the caste issue.

 Mani also bemoans Rammohun Ray?s invocation of the shastras in the debate on the abolition of sati. But what Mani fails to appreciate is that it may have been a pragmatic rather than ethical stand, in order to gain the interest of the colonial rulers or to garner the support of the ?disenfranchized? sections of society, who habitually followed the Brahmins. When the house is on fire, one must put out the flames first, and then, if need be, ponder on the ?political correctness? of the fire-fighting equipment. Wouldn?t Mani agree?

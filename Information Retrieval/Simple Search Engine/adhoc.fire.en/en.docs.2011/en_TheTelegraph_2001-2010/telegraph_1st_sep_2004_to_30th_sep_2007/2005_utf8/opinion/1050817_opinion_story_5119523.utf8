 Letters to Editor

 Labour in vain

 Sir ? The prime minister?s reference to the need for workers to act with ?responsibility? is a true demonstration of how pro-business and pro-rich our government has become (?PM advice to labour: Hold your fire?, Aug 4). Workers were beaten unconscious and critically injured in Gurgaon because their management broke the law and treated them as if they were slaves. As per criminal law, both management and police should be in jail. But that?s all irrelevant in the new India where management is god and demanding your rights is ?irresponsible?. Manmohan Singh?s speech is a clear message to companies ? commit any crime, break every law in the land, and be sure that the prime minister will help you repress your workers.

 Yours faithfully,

 Shankar Gopalakrishnan, Dahanu Road, Maharashtra

 The joyriders

 Sir ? On our 58th Independence Day, the tricolour could be seen flying high from houses, offices, factories and buildings. Politicians were foremost in celebrating the day. By now, the tricolour must be filthy ? from all the greasy palms which have held it ? and red with humiliation and shame. Celebrating Independence Day and garlanding freedom-fighters are nothing but hypocrisy. In a country where infants are fed contaminated milk-food, what meaning can independence have? In a country where women are gang-raped to preserve the honour of the clan, where mass butchering is organized by the state and its arms, where one cannot buy a train ticket without bribing all and sundry, independence is a farce. Independence is a lullaby sung to put us, the conscienceless masses, to sleep. Why blame our politicians? We deserve what we?ve got. No use whining about it. Just pack up all the patriotic rubbish and get on with life...the Indian way.

 Yours faithfully,

Sucheta Chatterjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? Why does the Indian government have to enact a farce twice a year in the Kashmir Valley? Independence and republic days should mean spontaneous celebrations by the people who feel proud of their country and its achievements. But when these celebrations mean shutting down an entire area and bringing wholesale misery to the entire population, then something must be very wrong. If the tri-colour is not unfurled in Kashmir on Independence Day, I don?t think it will change any of the ground realities, just as its forced unfurling changes nothing except further alienating the people. The wise men manning the government of India should use a bit of imagination. Instead of forced parades, they should organize relief for the victims of violence on these days, so that their miseries might be somewhat lessened. This way of celebrating national days may change the attitude of the local population towards the government. 

 Yours faithfully,

Rajiv Kumar, Calcutta

 Sir ? Though the Indian republic is soon going to be sixty years old, the country is held captive by the past. After the Advani-Jinnah issue which took us back by some 60 years we are now held captive by the 1984 Delhi riots, taking us back by 20 years. I guess that is progress ? fast-forwarding 40 years in a month or so. Levity apart, we need to think when, if we are going to recede into the past constantly and cripple our highest policy-making bodies dealing with these old issues, we will have the time to grapple with the present or look into the future. Further, the pomp, gaiety and grandeur with which we celebrate Independence Day shows that we are yet to rid ourselves of the bondage to the British. We are all aware of the sacrifices of the freedom-fighters who got us our independence, but we must move on. A simple function of raising the national flag and a one-minute silence in memory of the martyrs should be enough. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Kamat, Alto Porvorim, Goa

 Sir ? The photograph, captioned, ?India on move: at different speeds? in the Independence Day edition of The Telegraph was very touching. Most of the country?s so-called achievements are cosmetic in nature and the establishment, no matter which party or alliance holds power, seems reluctant to attack the core issues that need immediate attention. At this rate, the dream of the president, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, to make India a developed country by 2020 will remain just that, a dream. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir ? More than half-a-century after India gained independence, we are yet to understand the true meaning of the term. This Independence Day, a national holiday, I was looking out of my window when I noticed three boys not more than 20 of age, wearing sunglasses and dressed to kill, playing a very interesting game. They were trying to see who could first break the glass covering of the street lamp with a bottle filled with some fluid. Of course, this was independent India and August 15 is a day that sets everyone free. These boys thought that they are free to break things. Freedom comes with responsibility. It can only be meaningful when there is respect and regard for one?s fellow beings. 

 Yours faithfully,

Maushumi Guha, Calcutta

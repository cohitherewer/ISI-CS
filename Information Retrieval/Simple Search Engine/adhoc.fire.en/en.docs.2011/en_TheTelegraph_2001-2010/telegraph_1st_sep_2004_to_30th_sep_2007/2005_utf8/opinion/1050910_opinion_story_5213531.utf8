 Letters to Editor

 Meet the young

 Sir ? How many state governors today have the humility to sit among students in a college and attend a lecture as Gopal Gandhi did a few days back? This was not only refreshing, but it brought back memories of my college days when such things used to happen. I was even more impressed by the fact that the students did not raise political or administrative issues during their discussions with Gandhi. The president, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, has set the trend of such interaction with the young and it must be continued.

 Yours faithfully,

 K.B. Goswami, Calcutta 

 Teen power

 Sir ? Sania Mirza has returned from New York, a sadder but surely wiser person (?I enjoy carrying weight of billion expectations?, Sept 8). She should now be able to prepare herself better for the upcoming tournaments. Mean-while, she must not be carried away by all the adulation that she is getting. She must distance herself as far as possible from the glitzy shows. Many a promising Indian sportsman?s career has been ruined by the lure of celebrityhood. One hopes their tales act as a warning to Sania against accepting too many offers from the commercial world.

 Yours faithfully,

P.K. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? Indian tennis?s new sensation, Sania Mirza, has ended her US Open adventure with a fourth-round loss to Maria Sharapova of Russia. But she managed to win the hearts of billions of people across the globe. It must be granted that Sania did the best she could with her injury. Reaching the fourth round in the US Open will improve her rankings no end. And with the WTA Sunfeast Open in the offing, that is enough reason for Indians to cheer.

 Yours faithfully,

Md Mudassir Alam, New Delhi

 Sir ? The media has outdone themselves in making Sania Mirza a household name. Tennis has never been a popular sport in India. Even during their most successful run, Leander Peas and Mahesh Bhupathi did not have too large a following. But with the arrival of Sania, the media has taken it upon themselves to make her a star. Or why would an average player like her be compared to Steffi Graf and Maria Sharapova, and hailed as the best thing to happen to Indian sports? But if she keeps losing every third game, I am afraid the media?s hopes would ultimately be belied.

 Yours faithfully,

Wasim Ahmed, Calcutta

 Sir ? The last couple of weeks have been exhilarating for Indian sports-lovers. But whether in tennis or in athletics or in cricket, Indians have still stopped short of playing to their potential. That should not be too surprising. How can we expect world-class performers to come up when every se-cond one of us acts as critic, columnist or specialist?

 Yours faithfully,

Sayantan Das, Konnagar

 Sir ? In India, trifle achievements matter more than real successes. When Sania Mirza was creating ripples in Flushing Meadows, when Soma Biswas and Sushmita Singha-Roy were winning gold and silver for the country and Arjun Atwal was winning accolades on the golf course, most Indians, and more importantly, the media were busy with the tri-series in Zimbabwe. The gold and silver medals won by the Rajyavardhan Singh Rathores and Anju Bobby Georges shine brighter than the 34 test centuries of Sachin Tendulkar or the 10,000 runs of Sourav Ganguly, which only ring a bell in a few ex-colonies. Why can?t we concentrate on the sports which bring us true global recognition? 

 Yours faithfully,

Partha De Sarkar, Calcutta

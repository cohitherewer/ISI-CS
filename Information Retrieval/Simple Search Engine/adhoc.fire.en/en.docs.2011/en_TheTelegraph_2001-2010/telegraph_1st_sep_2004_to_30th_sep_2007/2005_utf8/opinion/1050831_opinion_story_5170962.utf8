 THE DOG ATE IT, MISS

 GWYNNE DYER

 ?Ahmed, where?s your homework?? ?The dog ate it, Miss. I had it all done, honest, but then the dog...? ?That?s all right, dear. Take another week and give it to me next Monday.? 

 Real teachers in Iraq are not so forgiving. But the parliament and its American overlords are another story entirely.

 The new Iraqi constitution was due to be handed in by August 15. Then there would be a referendum to ratify it on October 15, and new national elections to produce a somewhat more credible government for Iraq in December. Those deadlines were set by the US occupation authorities, who were desperately trying to create some ?turning point? after which the country would stabilize and American casualties would start to fall.

 ?We don?t want any delays. Now?s the time to get on with it,? said US defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld in late July. And Kurdish leader Jalal Talabani, the president of the current version of an Iraqi government, promised the US ambassador: ?There will be no delay.? But there was.

 The Kurds of northern Iraq and the Islamic religious parties who claim to represent the Shia Arabs of the south have made a deal to turn the country into a federal state. That gives the Kurds control over their own area (and their own oil), and a better shot at breaking away to create their own country at some future time. Federalism also suits the Shia religious parties, since it gives them the rest of Iraq?s oil and effective freedom to impose Islamic law over most of Iraq. 

 No more delays

 The big losers would be the Sunni Arabs of central Iraq, the traditional ruling group, who would end up with no oil and permanent Shia domination. So they rejected the Kurdish-Shia draft, and the August 15 deadline arrived with no agreement. Did the National Assembly dissolve itself and call new elections as the US-imposed rules required? No, it just gave the drafting committee one more week to agree on a new constitution. Who could blame them if the dog had eaten their homework?

 George W. Bush greeted this failure with his customary optimism: ?I applaud the heroic efforts of the Iraqi negotiators...? Another week of debate and negotiation passed, but no compromise emerged. Did the National Assembly dissolve itself on August 22? Of course not. It was just the dog again.

 The Kurds and Shia Arabs handed their joint draft over to the National Assembly without Sunni Arab agreement, insisting that technically this met the second deadline. Then they gave themselves three more days to work on extracting Sunni consent to the contents. President Bush hailed this as an ?amazing event?.

 On extension

 That third deadline expired last Thursday, and of course the Sunni Arab representatives had still not budged. They would be dead men if they did. At that point, Bush put in a personal call to the chief Shia negotiator, Abdul-Aziz al-Hakim, demanding that he offer more concessions to the Sunnis. 

 The post-third-deadline negotiations staggered on until Saturday, August 27, with no results. By now nobody could deny that the dog had well and truly died, and the Kurdish-Shia version of the constitution was presented to the National Assembly on Sunday.

 Even if the constitution is approved in the October referendum, the armed revolt among the Sunni Arabs will continue, because their concerns have been ignored. Bush now sounds quite testy about that: ?This talk about the Sunnis rising up. I mean the Sunnis have got to make a choice. Do they want to live in a society that?s free, or do they want to live in violence??

 But the Sunni Arabs of Iraq have defined their choices rather differently, and the insurgency will continue, regardless of any new constitution.

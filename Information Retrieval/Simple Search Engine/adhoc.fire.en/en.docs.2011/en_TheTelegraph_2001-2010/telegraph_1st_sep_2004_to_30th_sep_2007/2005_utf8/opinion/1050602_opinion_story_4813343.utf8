 YOUTH IN THE MIRROR

 GOURI CHATTERJEE

 May be it happened like this. It was near the end of a long meeting to thrash out plans for the launch ? how many paragliders would prowl the sky, when the lasers would plaster the Gateway of India with the red and black Mumbai Mirror masthead, etc. Suddenly, one bright spark had an out-of-the-box brainwave.

 We must get someone to endorse the product, he piped up. The applause was instantaneous. Celebrity approval for a newspaper, that would surely be a first. It was a wonder they hadn?t thought of it earlier. 

 The only question was who? Who would best represent a paper that was not just for Mumbaikars but by them too, fashioned on the basis of a massive market survey?

 How about Suketu Mehta?

 Who?

 You know, the writer. He?s written a book on Bombay, Maximun City. It?s a 600-rupee 600-page book and it?s sold 6,000 copies already.

 Only! No, we need a face, someone well known. 

 Shobhaa D??

 Too old. We are targeting the youth, aren?t we? That?s why we have such a young team running the paper.

 Shah Rukh Khan then?

 He?s endorsing too many products already. 

 One thing Mumbai does not lack is celebs. The meeting dragged on. Till it came down to a tie between Mallika Sherawat and Abhishek Bachchan. Junior-B won, not least because he is his father?s son. 

 If it didn?t happen quite this way, it could have. On Sunday, ?Mumbai boy? Abhishek Bachchan, ?chosen for the event because he epitomises Mumbai?s youthful spirit,? came in from the sea to exhort the milling crowd to ?go, buy it?. And Mumbai Mirror gave the news two of its ?compact? (read tabloid)-size pages within its ?entertainment? section. The young team knows its job.

 CNN turns 25

 Another out-of-the-box idea has just turned 25. It was on June 1, 1980, that Ted Turner nearly broke the bank to realize his dream: the first ever 24-hour news channel. 

 Everybody laughed. Who wants news round the clock, they scoffed, and dubbed his fledgling CNN, the Chicken Noodle Network. As for raw, unedited footage beamed live into people?s homes, the mind boggled. The only way Turner could air his channel was through the still nascent satellite technology.

 By 1982, Fidel Castro was saying CNN gave him news of the Soviet Union faster than the Soviet government. By ?91, the White House was turning to CNN for news of bombs over Baghdad rather than the Pentagon. Today, two billion souls in 200 countries swear by it.

 Ask Turner how he did it, revolutionized journalism, created the global village and built a worldwide brand, and pat comes the answer: ?We put journalism first, not TRPs and earnings, and that?s how we built CNN into something the world wanted to watch.? Turner was booted out of CNN five years ago. And the channel has been floundering ever since.

 Sheer novelty

 One of the golden rules of journalism is, never fall for your own hype. So, why we swallowed all that let-the-market-forces-rule tosh we spew out I don?t know. Presumably, it was the sheer novelty of being courted by so many proprietors and seeing salaries soar that made us lose our senses. We thought, in the demand-supply mismatch created by the churning in Mumbai, we, the experienced hands, called the shots. And went wild dictating terms to usually stingy bosses. Now, the three biggies who were bleeding the most and have the highest stakes have gone and signed a sort of no-aggression pact that they won?t hire each other?s staff. If that makes nonsense of their many fiery editorials in support of the free market, so be it. We should have known better.

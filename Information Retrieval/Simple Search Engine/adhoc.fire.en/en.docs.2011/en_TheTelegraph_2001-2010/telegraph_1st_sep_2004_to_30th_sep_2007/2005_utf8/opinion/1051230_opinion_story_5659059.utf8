 AREA OF DARKNESS

 The rule of law must still be an alien idea in some parts of Assam. But wherever that is the case, the responsibility must squarely lie with the government. If Assam?s Karbi Anglong district has become a battleground for murderous ethnic rivalries, the blame lies mainly with Dispur. The Assam government claims to know all that is there to know about the situation in the district. Unending violence between the Karbi and the Dimasa tribes should have kept Dispur on constant alert. Yet, another round of arson and attacks on a Dimasa village, allegedly by Karbi militants, has caught the government napping. Clearly, the administration did not heed the warnings with enough seriousness. Worse, Wednesday?s incident came hours before a Karbi militant group discussed with the government in Dispur matters relating to the former?s current ceasefire. It cannot be any comfort to the government or the people in the area that the raid on the Dimasa village was not the handiwork of the militants themselves. The administration cannot afford to be lulled into complacence in dealing with conflicts among ethnic groups.

 It is clear that the government needs a more effective strategy to contain ethnic violence in the area. The administration?s usual response to such situations is to try and prevent a reprisal by the affected group. It is absolutely necessary to ensure that attempts at reprisal are foiled. But additional Central or state forces are not the answer. The forces may be pretty ineffective if an efficient intelligence network is not in place. More important, the government has to look deeper in order to see the root of the ethnic distrust. Karbi Anglong is among the poorest of Assam?s districts. Most Karbis and Dimasas live in grinding poverty. Much of the tension between the communities relates to disputes over land and the forests. But above all, there is a feeling among the people that they are too poor to matter to Dispur. This seems to be the biggest problem. Because of the remoteness of the area and the acute poverty of the people, successive state governments have left Karbi Anglong to its own devices. That makes it a vicious cycle. Ignored by distant Dispur, the tribal people are forced to live in constant fear of violence. That, in turn, begets more violence.

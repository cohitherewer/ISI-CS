 MAKING AN ASS OF THE LAW 

 MALVIKA SINGH

 Anarchy in India means a free for all ? the ruled and those who administer the rule. And, anarchy is alive and kicking in India. The cricket controversy just proves that our press is lazy, picks up anything it can find regardless of its import as national front page news and continues to whip it till it has run out of all possible steam. The media went on and on about the Natwar Singh ?episode? and now they are hammering away at the cricket non-issue. It was absurd to find the defence minister, the chief minister of Bengal, Sharad Pawar and the rest going on and on about their ?surprise? about the dropping of Sourav Ganguly from the team. Why are these gentlemen politicking when a selection committee is mandated to make the choice? We all know how this chorus on cricket choices has been orchestrated, who the bandmasters are, the unwarranted ?politics? of it all, the desperate attempt to garner ?public support? by those politicians who interfered and spoke against the legitimate choice by a legitimate body. What an unacceptable precedent to set!

 In a similar example, the Delhi government is trying to defy a Supreme Court ruling that has asked for all illegal additions and structures in the capital city to be demolished. This kind of populism at the cost of the future of our cities and their inhabitants is a damnation of civil society for garnering votes based on anarchical realities. In a democracy, all must bow to the majesty of the law. That is why there are laws. Those who break the law, who want to add illegal rooms to their homes, bribe to do so. 

 Municipalities have been corrupted, people are corrupt, great ancient and historic cities have become slums, modern towns and cities are without any infrastructure or civic facilities, filth abounds, electricity is stolen, water is running out and the people are demanding the right to do wrong. The government wants to join them in this loop of corruption, hoping that the wrongdoers will vote them in for another term. There is no sane rule of law, people mock the law, the lawmakers themselves break the law. It is sick-making to say the very least. The bottom of this abyss is dark and murky.

 Red badge of bluff

 Strangely, there is a section of society that is asking for the correctives to be initiated and in some areas, a glimmer of light flashes past every now and again. The courts do uphold the ?right?, governments often try and ignore the diktat while they carry on ?making it? till the courts make a final intervention. The ?corrupt? then try and get the support of the ?people? by offering them sops. Defiance of the authority instead of questioning and confronting the authority is becoming the norm.

 It was rather upsetting to find Prakash Karat phoo-phooing the Election Commission report on the findings of how elections are conducted in West Bengal. Surely he cannot be ?holier than thou? about every party except his own. It was the most amazing display of hypocrisy. If the CPI(M) is so upright, so honest, so transparent, why does it react in this strident manner? It should encourage all and witness its ?free and fair? election process. What is it afraid of? What does it want to suppress? Will its rhetoric be exposed as being totally hollow when it comes to its own internal workings? Why this defensive retort? Is it only the CPI(M) that can abuse one and all in this democracy? Is it the only party that is permitted to blackmail the government when it wants its way? Is dictatorship its modus operandi, which is why it dismisses any other view? Is it the only party that can defy the EC? Different laws for different people ? is that its ideology?

 Let us hope that the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, has the political will and strength to publicly oppose all these horrors that beset India and Bharat. Will that be his gift to the nation?

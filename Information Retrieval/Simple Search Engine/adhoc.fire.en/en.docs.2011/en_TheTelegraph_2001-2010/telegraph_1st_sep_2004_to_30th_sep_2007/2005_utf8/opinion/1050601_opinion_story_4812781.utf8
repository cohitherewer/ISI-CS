 ANY OTHER NAME

 Semantic quibbles often make for good political rhetoric. The chief minister of West Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, an ardent champion of economic reforms, recently expressed his irritation at the phrase, ?hire and fire?. The chief minister was discussing ways of improving work culture and expressed the view that government employees, once they are made permanent, become laggards in their work. They begin to pay less attention to their work because they know that according to the terms of their employment they cannot lose their jobs because of a lack of efficiency. The chief minister wanted these conditions to change in order to improve the level of efficiency among government employees. In this context, someone let slip the dreaded phrase, ?hire and fire?. Not only was the chief minister irritated but he also declared that he was not advocating such a policy; he was only suggesting that the government should be more conscious of the market and its realities. It was a nice piece of equivocation for which Mr Bhattacharjee must have earned himself a few brownie points. 

 If, following Mr Bhattacharjee?s injunction, the government has to look towards the market and in order to improve levels of efficiency, adopt contractual, and not permanent, forms of employment, how exactly would it be different from hire and fire? This is where Mr Bhattacharjee has equivocated. Employment by contract means that when the need for that work disappears, or if the employee does not fulfil the terms of his contract by working efficiently, his contract can be terminated. This is at the heart of the reform of labour laws and is no different from ?hire and fire?. The phrase sounds harsh but, in principle and in substantive content, is not any different from contractual employment. The chief minister played safe by saying that he is against ?hire and fire? since the words carry an ideological load, which is difficult for leftists to accept.

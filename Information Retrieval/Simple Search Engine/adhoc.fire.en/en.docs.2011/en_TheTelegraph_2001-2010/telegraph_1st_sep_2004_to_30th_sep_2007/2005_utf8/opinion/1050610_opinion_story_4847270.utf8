 WINNING WITHOUT A FIGHT

 Abhijit Bhattacharyya

 More than the authenticity of Gohar Ayub Khan?s statement about the past transaction of an Indian army brigadier with Pakistan, what should bother us more is its implications for the Indian army and the national security scenario. One may argue here, and with some conviction, that the two greatest threats to India?s security come from a break-up of the army and corruption in high and sensitive places. 

 Should this be dismissed as mere speculation? Or should this be interpreted as a warning? Perhaps the latter. A look at India?s war history will show that despite numerous examples of bravery and individual sacrifice, lack of cohesion and discipline have often led to defeat, be it at Hydaspes in 326 BC or the third battle of Panipat in 1761. And a loss at the battlefield has almost always led to the loss of freedom. 

 Gohar Khan has, in one stroke, put into effect the theory of the Chinese philosopher-general, Sun Tzu. The theory sees warfare as ?deception?. One could create disorder in the enemy forces and defeat them. If they were united, they had to be separated by misinformation. Distrust could be sown by pointing fingers at the loyalty of those in command of the war office.

 How to sneak in

 Warfare is a continuous process, and Gohar?s offensive makes it plainly evident. Sun Tzu says, ?The general is the supporting pillar of state. If the supporting pillar is marked by fissures, the state will invariably grow weak.? The Pakistanis have done exactly that. There is no confusion, contradiction or ambiguity in the operation. 

 Sun Tzu goes on, ?The highest ideal is to subjugate the enemy without fighting, by frustrating their plans, thwarting their preparations?. To subjugate India without a fight, Pakistan would simply have to frustrate its war plans. Get an information sneaked in and India?s political decision and military implementation would be crushed instantaneously. 

 The aim is to destroy the Indian army, undoubtedly the last hurdle to the subjugation of its people. The Indian army, has, in the last 200 years, withstood the test of time and answered its calls of duty. India?s army has been more successful than any of the other established state institutions. However, this is not to say that everything is fine with it. There are signs of fatigue. There is injustice, corruption and parochialism. The matter needs immediate attention as an army cannot function with confused soldiers working under biased generals.

 Double agents

 Take the disturbed areas in the North-east and Punjab (some time back). Could the disturbances at home have left the soldiers entirely unaffected? Any army determined to weaken a strong neighbour is bound to explore all sectors and resort to unconventional means. 

 Finally, about Sun Tzu?s ?double agents?, to whom one needs to be ?generous? as the ?ultimate intent of warfare should be to preserve one?s own people while rapidly vanquishing the enemy.? Let us assume, without conceding, that the Indian brigadier did sell the warplan to Pakistanis. He thus became a double agent, thereby also becoming one of the biggest threats to India?s national security. 

 This confirms India?s danger from corrupt officials in sensitive posts. India need not be perturbed by Gohar Khans? revelations, but it should worry about the frequent cases of corruption and misdemeanour on the part of some officers, the fake encounters, the false claim on awards, the crass misuse of power. Pakistan will always try to penetrate the sensitive government departments and take full advantage of the corruption-ridden system to destroy India?s army.

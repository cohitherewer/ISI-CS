 FAMILY MATTERS

 - Relations stop nowhere

 Slightly at odds

 Two Lives By Vikram Seth, Viking, Rs 695

 Part memoir, part biography, part reflective meditation on the long twentieth century, Vikram Seth?s Two Lives aligns the terrible history of our times with the unremarked existences of ordinary persons. Resolutely anchored in the ?truth? of personal knowledge and reminiscence, it is a work eschewing the fictional modes Seth has earlier explored. Yet it takes its matter from the same source ? Seth?s family ? that produced A Suitable Boy: it is a relation of relations. Henry James saw relatedness as a problem the novelist needed to solve. In the Preface to Roderick Hudson, he wrote: ?really, universally, relations stop nowhere, and the problem of the artist is eternally but to draw, by a geometry of his own, the circle in which they shall happily appear to do so.? Seth has drawn these circles many times in his fiction, but the problem seems for him to be peculiarly acute when his subjects are relations in another sense: relatives. In A Suitable Boy, marriage, that novelistic staple, offered a long-drawn-out means of closure: in the present work only death can intervene between the writer and his relation. As Seth has admitted, he could scarcely have published this account while his subjects were alive.

 Two Lives tells the stories of Seth?s maternal great-uncle, Shanti Behari Seth, a London dentist, trained in pre-war Germany, who lost his right arm while serving in the British army dental corps at the battle of Monte Cassino, and his wife Hennerle Caro, a German Jew whose mother and sister died in the concentration camps of Theresienstadt and Auschwitz. The accounts are mediated by the author?s own closeness to his great-uncle and aunt, from the time when, at the age of seventeen, he went to live under their guardianship in London. Incidentally, therefore, the work is also autobiographical, recording, though lightly and tangentially, the uncertainties of the author?s late adolescence, his going up to Oxford, his graduate studies at Stanford and later in China, and his discovery of his own vocation as poet and writer. At one level Seth?s relation to his great-uncle and aunt is deeply personal: at another it is tied in with the history of the Seth family as a whole, Shanti?s sense of obligation towards his elder brother Raj, who sponsored his education, and his affection for Raj?s children and grandchildren, including Vikram. That this sense appears to be voluntarily betrayed at the end, in the dramatic account of Shanti?s will, is finally of a piece with the complicated, unpredictable nature of Indian family relationships.

 At the level of personal memoir on the author?s part, the details of the family?s dealings with Shanti Uncle and Aunty Henny are of a blinding ordinariness, scarcely the stuff, one would think, of written record. Despite a qualified attachment on Shanti?s part to his Indian relations, Henny never really takes to them. The exception is Vikram himself, who forms a close bond with her when she helps him with the German needed for entrance to Oxford. Even so, there is little intimacy in the relationship; Henny is a reticent, somewhat stiff person who rarely unbends to the Indian side of the family. Typically, she is described as calling up to her husband, when faced with Vikram?s parents on her doorstep, ?Shanti, your relations are here!? For the author it is a sufficient concession that in the end she refers to him as her nephew. Both she and her husband come across as intensely lonely, private individuals, in life as in death. In Shanti this loneliness is scarcely masked by his cooperation, in old age, with his great-nephew?s memorializing project; garrulity and goodwill co-exist with an equally characteristic confusion and suspiciousness. What is not available to scrutiny, his deep attachment to his wife, constitutes a silence which the everyday details of Seth?s account ? the open quarrels in German, the holidays in Switzerland, the friends, the illnesses, the dependence on carers ? never fill in.

 These everyday details, often dreary and uninspiring, are intricately worked into a record, constructed through reminiscence, family accounts and letters, of Shanti?s childhood in Biswan in UP, his training as a dentist in Berlin, where he lodged with Henny?s family, learnt German and gained a PhD, his experiences in the army as a part of the British North African and Italian campaigns, his loss of an arm, and his re-building of a life and career as a one-armed dentist in London, after his marriage to Henny. This is a narrative inviting the author?s sympathetic, anecdotal reconstruction of an old man?s memories. Public history, as in the accounts of the battle of Monte Cassino, which led to the Allied bombing and destruction of one of the greatest repositories of Western learning, can blend seamlessly into this account.

 But Henny?s story is one she herself chose never to tell, not even to her husband. Seth constructs it out of a cabin trunk full of old letters, poems and minor memorabilia, piecing together the information relating to Henny?s own escape from Berlin in the late summer of 1939 through the good offices of her fianc??s father, and the fate of her mother, sister, fianc? and friends, who were perforce left behind. This story, whose survival is an accidental miracle, belongs to the unhealable wound at the heart of the twentieth century, the murder of European Jews. Like many holocaust stories, it mingles nostalgia for the Berlin of the Thirties, when Henny was courted by the handsome Hans (who later married a non-Jew, perhaps from an instinct of self-preservation) and Shanti merged easily into their group of friends, with the first hints of danger in 1938-39, and the chilling facts of Lola?s and Frau Caro?s ?transportation? to the camps in 1943. The letters Henny preserved show her learning the fates of her mother and sister, and trying to establish who, in those perilous times, were their friends; a laborious, self-qualifying, almost impossible task. Many letters convey stark images of life in post-war Berlin, in an atmosphere of suspicion, distrust, and grinding physical deprivation. Seth?s own research supplies what is missing from that record: the reality of the camps.

 Not only are the two lives Seth records of contrasting kinds, then; they offer, too, different kinds of relational possibility. One is linked to the family memoir; anecdotal, rich in a difference of perspectives, buttressed by reminiscence, pre-narrativized, it makes Shanti part of a complex network: ?your relations are here.? The other, never related in Henny?s lifetime, is bound in with the starkness and irreversibility of particular events, which rob Henny of her relations and require her history to be reconstructed, even itemized, with reference to the archive. If anything, Seth?s loyalties are to the first kind of narrative, culminating in the moment of family disappointment at the close; his subjects, left to themselves, might have chosen the second. If the first is linked to an idea, perhaps almost obsolete, of the Indian family, the second marks the trauma of European modernity. The two possibilities, carefully crafted by Seth into a single structure, remain to the end slightly at odds, slightly uneasy partners in an eccentric union.

 Letters to Editor

 Thinking up a storm

 Sir ? Three hurricanes ripped through the south of the United States of America in the last couple of months. It is interesting to note the responses of different groups of people to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. Global terrorists claim that divine vengeance has finally come upon America. Liberal activists have found ways to blame George W. Bush for the calamity; greedy tycoons are trying to make profit from the tragedies, while environmentalists contrive a link with global warming. Thankfully, a larger number of people have found it more worthwhile to help the victims. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Home alone

 Sir ? Given the rather narrow scope of the two surveys cited by Ashok V. Desai in his article, ?The postmodern woman? (Oct 18), he seems to draw the wrong conclusions. While there might not be any appreciable economic loss to societies if educated women do not work, Desai and the redoubtable men he follows cannot begin to imagine the loss to such women in terms of personal fulfilment, intellectual and social satisfaction, and even self-image.

 They cannot ? or will not ? understand the nature of women?s choices in patriarchal settings. Far oftener than not, an educated and skilled woman?s ?choice? to stay at home to raise kids is subtly, but powerfully, influenced by factors such as spousal expectations, societal pressure and their own internalization of gender roles with the resultant anxiety about being a ?good? mother. And we are not even going into the very real problem of inadequate maternity leave and other necessary conveniences at workplaces.

 That women are still having to choose between motherhood and a working life is matter of course for Desai and his fraternity while it should actually be a cause for worry. Although Desai quotes Judith Tucker on the need for greater gender parity, he seems to side more with Richard Posner who unquestioningly believes that ?women on average have a greater taste and aptitude for taking care of children...and for non-market activities?. That much of this ?taste and aptitude? is the outcome of sexual determinism at work in the form of women?s socialization in patriarchy has been established by Simone de Beauvoir, Nancy Chodorow and Adrienne Rich.

 What Desai defines as women learning from their mothers? mistakes is actually a case of women despairing of living complete lives and going in for fragmented selves: faced with a rigidly gendered society, they are avoiding the ?mistake? of expecting it to change. The celebration of ?the postmodern woman? by men is in fact a part of the larger process of naturalization of imposed definitions of women and their needs. Desai has, in effect, provided us with a meta-discourse on the sociology of gender.

 Yours faithfully,

Suparna Banerjee, Chandannagar

 Sir ? ?The postmodern woman? raises a sensitive yet important issue. But Ashok V. Desai?s opinions are based on a survey conducted only among women students. We know that a person?s expectations at the age of 18 may not foreshadow her life choices ten years later. 

 What is so bizarre about being educated yet choosing to be a stay-at-home parent? The real challenge is in treating this choice as one that should apply equally to both men and women. Cynthia Liu told Louise Story, ?My mother always told me you can?t be the best career woman and the best mother at the same time.? We can claim to have made real progress as a society when we can say just as easily, ?You can?t be the best career man and the best father at the same time.? 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sekhar Basu Mallik, Calcutta

 START AT THE VERY BEGINNING

 The recent Jharkhand high court ruling raises fundamental questions about constitutional guarantees for the weak, writes Uttam Sengupta

 At the crossroads

 I n Jharkhand, a high court ruling on panchayat elections has inflamed passions which threaten to widen the gulf between tribals and non-tribals. The ruling, which has also reopened a public debate on reservation and constitutional guarantees to tribes, appears to have failed to appreciate the distinction between general laws and special laws.

 With the first wave of industrialization having left them in the cold, tribes in Jharkhand are understandably wary of the next wave of industrialization about to hit them. The state government is said to have pledged around 42,000 acres for mining and new steel mills alone. That would displace at least 30,000 families, almost all of them tribal. Yet, the rehabilitation policy has not been finalized. Like the Red Indians in New Mexico, mining and industry have robbed tribals of their home and hearth and pushed them into ghettos. 

 But there is a twist in the tale. Some remarkable missionary activity by both Christian and non-Christian groups have helped educate some tribals. Which is why you now have a tribal from Jharkhand working as a town planner in Mumbai or an IPS officer in Punjab or as diplomats in Paris and Beijing. Two parallel currents of migration out of the region ? one for education and better employment and another for livelihood ? have reduced their number in their own homeland. The 2001 census puts the figure at 26 per cent in the Jharkhand region. They are now being coerced to give up their special status in the ?scheduled areas? ? where, under presidential notification, tribals enjoy special privileges as per the Fifth Schedule. There have been three such notifications for the Jharkhand region in the last 30 years. While the first two identified districts as ?scheduled areas?, the last in 2003 identified a set of blocks in different districts. Clearly, the area is shrinking and will possibly get even smaller, given the exodus of tribals and influx of outsiders in search of opportunities.

 The violent reaction of tribals to the high court?s ruling is, therefore, not entirely unexpected. The feeling of betrayal and deprivation was intensified by public celebrations by groups of non-tribals hailing the verdict. Tribals instinctively retaliated by hitting the streets, calling the judiciary names and accusing it of conniving with outsiders to deprive them of a constitutional right. Reports of clashes, pamphleteering and public speeches have also raised the pitch. Tribal commentators have bitterly criticized the ruling, and the more militant among them have interpreted it as tantamount to asking tribals to get lost in their own home. Demoralized and angry, they are wondering if they must now migrate to other states as domestic help or casual labourers. The reluctance of the state government to challenge the ruling in the Supreme Court, because it does not want to antagonize the numerically superior non-tribals, has added to the bitterness.

 The ruling is curious because it seeks to deny what is enjoyed by tribals in as many as eight states under the Fifth Schedule. Responding to petitions seeking dereservation of the chairman?s post in panchayats where the tribal population is less than 40 per cent (even in scheduled areas), the court came out with a sweeping ruling. Even in tribal-majority scheduled areas, it ruled, not more than 50 per cent of the chairmen?s posts can be reserved. The Panchayat (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 had reserved all the chairmen?s posts in scheduled areas for tribals. PESA is part of the Fifth Schedule and eight states have already conducted their panchayat election in accordance with its provisions.

 The high court ruled that ?cent per cent? reservation is excessive, unreasonable and flies against the right to equality. PESA was declared unconstitutional. The implications of the ruling are far-reaching. If the apex court too upholds the ruling, scheduled tribes will actually have to be content with less than 50 per cent of the chairmen?s seats in even those panchayats where their population is 70 per cent or more. This is because the 50 per cent ceiling on reservation covers all eligible categories, including SCs and other backward classes. Perversely, the non-tribals, who till now could not contest for the chairmen?s posts in the scheduled areas, will not only have 50 per cent of the seats in these areas for themselves, but in some of the non-scheduled areas where tribal population is less than 10 per cent, they will continue to have access to 80 per cent or more of the seats. 

 To be fair, the high court, by the same ruling, also ordered that seats be reserved for tribals in the non-scheduled areas in proportion to their population, a provision which is not there in PESA. But the apparently well-meaning order has merely inflamed passions and raised more questions about tribal welfare. The high court order does appear to question the spirit of the Fifth Schedule. Special laws provide ?positive discrimination? to protect the weak against the strong. The Fifth Schedule in fact allows the governor of a scheduled state to withdraw even a Central act from such areas if he is convinced that it would be detrimental to tribal interest. 

 The high court ruling virtually tells tribals that they are ?equal citizens? and do not require ?excessive? protection. If the ruling is upheld, then all special provisions made for tribals could one day be set aside on the ground of equality and justice for all. Judging by their decreasing numbers, neither the creation of Jharkhand nor the Fifth Schedule seems to have offered tribals much protection.

 That is why the ruling appears to be the last straw on the camel?s back. Interpreting the Constitution has been tricky at the best of times, and trickier when it involved ?reservation?. Still, just when people had started believing that the issue had been settled once and for all, the Jharkhand high court has prompted a fresh debate on what the Constitution contains for the weak.

 FOR SOME CHEAP THRILLS

 NEHA SAHAY

 Among non-Christian Asian countries, Christmas in Hong Kong is legendary for the spectacular way it is celebrated. ?Wishing walkways?, where you tie a tag on which you write your Xmas wish under a canopy of multicoloured lights; lit-up towers; fireworks on the sea front and so on. As one mainland Chinese woman who?d gone to Hong Kong specially for Xmas said, ?I really like the shows here; we don?t get that on the mainland.? 

 Mainland Chinese can now travel to Hong Kong on special short-term permits, generally valid for 24 hours only. This year, there was a special reason for them to do so: Disneyland, which opened in Hong Kong in September. So far, mainlanders have made up 26 per cent of Disneyland?s visitors. 

 The smallest of the five Disneylands in the world, this much-hyped attraction has apparently flopped, thanks to its high entry ticket: 350 HK dollars, and its limited offerings. Hong Kong?s older Ocean Park has much more to offer at cheaper rates. Also, Disneyland officials didn?t exactly endear themselves to Hong Kongers when they insisted that food inspectors take off their caps and badges so as not to alarm visitors. Nor was their attitude to Hong Kong?s pop stars, who?d actually offered to do free promotional videos, exactly respectful. But Xmas eve saw all tickets sold out ? only the second time this has happened. The first time was on the first day of the WTO ministerial conference held in Hong Kong last month. 

 Fairy-tale stuff

 Mainland China has its own Hong Kong: Shenzhen, where everything is aimed at outdoing Hong Kong. They seem to have succeeded, for this year, 500,000 Hong Kongers left their own Xmas attractions behind to cross the border into Shenzhen for Christmas. 

 As China?s first special economic zone, Shenzhen is teeming with expatriates. Those who can?t afford to fly back home, stay on here for Xmas, and find it?s not so bad. In fact, apart from family and snow, they get the full Xmas package: lights everywhere, lit-up Xmas trees, even turkey-and-wine dinners, waitresses dressed up like mini-skirted Santa Clauses ? most of this at less than half the price at home.

 For Hong Kong residents, that?s the main attraction: shopping here is so cheap compared to Hong Kong, and everything is available here ? even a Disneyland. 

 Shenzhen?s ?Happy Valley? has a whole range of attractions, including a ?Happy Kingdom? offering all the thrills one can think of to make you scream your heart out: roller-coaster rides, mine trains, space shots, power surges and so on. Built in 1997, the complex has a Hollywood section, a Cartoonland, a Lost World and a Water Park. 

 Loyal fun

 Chinese who can?t wait to go to Disneyland are dumbstruck when informed that their own version is twice as large. For those still hankering after Disneyland?s cartoon parade, Happy Kingdom has its own parade of Santa Clauses from all over the world, followed by assorted characters: Red Indians and Cowboys, Dukes and Duchesses, Egyptian pharaohs with their harems ? all on lit-up chariots. There?s even a special Xmas pop music show. All truly Western, except for the stalls selling Chinese fast food and, wonder of wonders, Indian vegetarian samosas and paratha stuffed with sweet potato. 

 Best of all, they have two plays in an open-air theatre, in which the audience is invited to participate. Those willing must play the role of villagers resisting the Japanese army with their own skills, crude implements and rustic weapons. As intrepid members of the audience line up on stage, the compere asks each of them not their names, but which region they are from, perhaps to instill a feeling for the Motherland.

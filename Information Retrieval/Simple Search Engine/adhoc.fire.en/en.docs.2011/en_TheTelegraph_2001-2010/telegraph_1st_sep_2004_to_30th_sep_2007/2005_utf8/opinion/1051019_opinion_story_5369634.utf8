 PAST LADY

 No worse fate can befall a politician than increasing irrelevance. Ms Mamata Banerjee has placed herself in that hapless plight. One time chief minister of West Bengal in-waiting, she was shocked when the electorate rejected her in the assembly polls of 2001. Since then she has been trying to make a comeback and has been failing. This failure is a result of her inability to read the trends of the time and to fathom the moods of the people. The people of West Bengal are tired of agitational politics, of violence and disruption. The electorate of West Bengal have voted for stability and they want their state to grow economically. The government of Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee promised both, and has delivered. Ms Banerjee, on the other hand, remains trapped in a time warp. Take her latest display of protest against the visit of Mr Benny Santoso, the head of Salim Group which is poised to make the biggest ever investment in the state. She has threatened to bring Calcutta to a standstill through violent protests. What is ominous is her warning to parents not to send their children to school. She is trying to create an atmosphere of terror and intimidation.

 It is difficult to comprehend what Ms Banerjee is protesting against. Is she against the entry of all investors into West Bengal? If the protest is directed against the taking away of agricultural land for industrial purposes, then her protest is misplaced. This visit of Mr Santoso has nothing to do with his plans to build a township just south of Calcutta. It would appear that having lost almost everything, this is Ms Banerjee?s last desperate throw of the dice. She wants to create an incident and then draw political capital from it. This is perhaps where she has reckoned without the popular mood. The more violence she provokes, the further she will plummet in the popularity charts. Ms Banerjee, whether she realizes it or not, is past her sell-by date. She is yesterday?s leader, following yesterday?s politics. She has done enough damage to her political career, and now she seems hell-bent on harming the state of West Bengal. She is a prima donna without an aria.

 WAY OF ALL FLESH

 - To be imperfect is to be human

 Rembrandt: Hendrickje Bathing

 On Beauty 

 By Zadie Smith, 

 Hamish Hamilton, ? 4.50

 The two husbands in the novel are weak men: Englishman Howard Belsey, the ?radical art theorist?, muddling through the 442-page novel with his unfinished tome on Rembrandt?s ordinariness, and going to bed with the wrong people ? it gets from bad to worse ? quite helpless with desire, and Trinidadian Monty Kipps, the ?cultural conservative?, pedantic and self-righteous, furtively but systematically sleeping around and cruelly suppressing exposure. The two neat labels for the men are, by proxy, Kiki?s. She is the massive African-American wife of Belsey. She was once slender and beautiful, and is now in many ways the still centre of the turmoil of values in the novel. Her evanescent, instinctive friendship with Carlene Kipps, Monty?s wife, has the quality of a primal bond that sometimes unexpectedly springs up between women. Although brief, it has a weight that the plot can barely contain. Their attraction further complicates the events and relationships already compounded by their husbands? engagement in a biting cultural war. The wise men are fools and weaklings, the stay-at-home wives sensitive and sagacious ? this simplistic scheme is the novel?s chief weakness.

 But comedy demands a scheme, and this scheme is not as simplistic as it seems in the retelling. The sprawling, eventful narrative is set mainly in a college town in New England, called Wellington, where Belsey teaches and where Kipps and his family turn up when Kipps is appointed visiting professor of art. The visit could not have been timed worse. Jerome, the eldest son of the liberal Belseys, has just returned after an initially idyllic stay in the Kipps?s impressively ordered and classy London home. He had been taken in as paying guest when he had crossed the sea to escape the tension in his house caused by the discovery ? only part-discovery, as it turns out later ? of his father?s extramarital affair. Jerome, too, has not been idle. Idealistic and vague, he had fallen in love with the Kipps?s bewitching daughter, Victoria, and had to leave when his hopes of a teenage marriage had been harshly dismissed.

 Smith is brilliant in creating scenes and dialogue in multiple registers: the mad breakfast moment in the Belsey household when Howard tries to make Kiki take Jerome?s last email of an impending engagement to Victoria seriously is an excellent example of her craft. The intensity between husband and hurt wife is set off by the searching comments of Zora, their intellectually aspiring daughter, and the hunt for an early morning subsidy by Levi, their younger son, whose idea of political correctness is to mix with the brothers on the street and pretend to be poor, and who will, ultimately, take up the Haitian cause with disastrous-comic results. The vibrant and crowded moments, at breakfast, at the party, in the fair, are layered with comedy, poignancy, and personal and professional concerns that conflict and mingle.

 This is Smith?s tribute to E.M. Forster?s Howards End. Two families, with completely different political and moral attitudes, are thrown against each other. On Beauty searches for the beauty of being wholly oneself, for this, as the novel shows, is the most difficult search, especially when it is complicated by the confusions of race, religion and colour. These are inextricable from even the most personal of problems; that Howard has been having an affair with a friend is somehow made worse by the fact that she is white. ?Everywhere we go,? screams Kiki at him, ?I?m alone in this?this sea of white?.My whole life is white. I don?t see any black folk unless they be cleaning under my feet?I staked my whole life on you. And I have no idea any more why I did that.?

 Colour and race, as well as class, form the bewildering mesh within which every character tries to find out who he or she is, if there is an identity to be discovered or to be made, whether ambition and desire are the right guides to self-fashioning, or perhaps faith and acceptance. Levi, Zora, the restless Victoria, the beautiful rapster Carl whom Zora tries to pull into middle-class life, Kiki herself and everyone else are caught always in transit as it were, changing, moulting, reaching out to something or someone else. The compassionate wisdom of Kiki, who alone is not ?intellectual? in the town of intellectuals, springs from this knowledge of change. She tells Howard, using as metaphor the changing of her own body: ?I?d rather be alone. I don?t want someone to have contempt for who I?ve become. I?ve watched you become too.? She has done her best to ?honour the past, and what you were and what you are now?. But, she says, ?You want something more than that, something new. I can?t be new.?

 ?There?s such a shelter in each other,? Carlene had quoted to Kiki, unconscious of the source of the line she loved. This is another of Smith?s allusions to Forster, and the line rings like an ironic allurement throughout the novel. As shelters are found, refused or repudiated, Howard, who was writing on Rembrandt because he disliked him, stands speechless during his big lecture, as the screen lights up with Rembrandt?s Hendrickje Bathing. The woman that the artist loved is painted with her flesh rendered in all its varied tints, ?and the ever present human hint of yellow, intimation of what is to come?. The imperfection of Rembrandt is the beauty of being human, and it is this simple truth that Howard and everyone around him search for with both comic and tragic results.

 HELPING HAND IN TIMES OF NEED

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the communique issued by the G8 nations at Gleneagles, July 8

 Growth in sixteen African countries averaged over 4 per cent in the past decade, higher than any major developed country. Twenty-four African countries have now signed up to have their progress reviewed by their peers. And the promotion of good governance, peace and security and economic development is at the heart of the African Union and its programme, the New Partnership for Africa?s Development.

 4. The G8 has focused on issues of importance to Africa at every Summit since the late 1990s.

 5. Further progress in Africa depends above all on its own leaders and its own people. We welcome their commitment to take responsibility for developing their continent, and to promote good governance and take action against corruption in their countries. We want to help them ensure that reforms in Africa gain momentum: today we renew our own commitment to support countries and people making such efforts.

 6. We have therefore agreed a set of further measures designed to help Africa build the successful future all of us want to see, many of which will be applicable to other poor countries. These actions must be undertaken in a co-ordinated and coherent manner. Better governance, stability and peace are necessary for the private sector to grow and create jobs; a growing private sector creates more revenue for investment in health and education; increased numbers of healthy, well-skilled people will improve capacity for governance. These mutually-reinforcing actions should accelerate the self-sustaining growth of Africa and end aid dependency in the long term.

 7. Our commitments today build on Africa?s own efforts, set out in the AU and NEPAD strategies and programme, and on the G8?s past and present commitments. Progress on the Africa Action Plan, agreed at Kananaskis, has been reviewed by our Africa Personal Representatives. We have also noted the conclusions of the recent report of the Commission for Africa. Other countries are willing to share their experience of successful economic development, including in Asia, and we recognize that South-South cooperation can make a significant contribution. In some areas we intend to strengthen our support for what is already working; in others a reinforced effort is required.

 8. Peace is the first condition of successful development. We support Africa?s efforts to build a peaceful and stable Africa. We will help Africa?s fragile states to emerge successfully from crisis and conflict. We support African initiatives to prevent, mediate and resolve conflicts and consolidate peace, in the spirit of the UN Charter. And we back the African Union and the other African institutions which must continue to develop their capacity for promoting lasting peace and stability on the continent. In this regard, we are progressing with our Sea Island commitment to train and, where appropriate equip, some 75,000 troops by 2010 to take part in peace support operations worldwide, with a sustained focus on Africa. We commend and will continue to support the African Union?s mission in Sudan (Darfur), just as we are contributing to UNMIS?s operation in southern Sudan.

 9. We will enhance our support for the development of Africa?s capacity to resolve conflicts and keep the peace, consistent with our national laws, by:

 (a) Providing co-ordinated technical assistance to the African Standby Force and helping to establish planning elements at the African Union HQ and its regional brigades.

 (b) Supporting the AU in developing its ability to deploy unarmed military observer missions, civilian policing operations and gendarmerie/carabinieri-like forces as part of stabilization and peace support operations.

 (c) Providing support, including flexible funding, for African peace support operations including transport, logistics and financial management capacity.

 (d) Countering terrorism in Africa, including through co-operation with the AU Anti-Terrorism Centre in Algiers.

 (e) Supporting efforts from regional and international organizations to reinforce African capacity to promote peace and stability.

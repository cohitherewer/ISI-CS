 Letters to Editor

 The golden boot

 Sir ? At the risk of sounding like an affronted feminist, I have to say that the ?severance package? now being offered to Carly Fiorina, the former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, is abysmally inadequate (?Fiorina severance package worth $42m?, Feb 13). It does not compensate for the humiliation that Carly had to suffer at the hands of the predominantly male management. Carly?s rise ? she began as a receptionist ? had almost convinced us that the glass ceiling was a thing of the past. But obviously, it is still very difficult to consider a woman manager as hard-working or as committed as her male counterpart. Why should the woman be the scapegoat nine times out of ten? The glass ceiling exists, no matter how much we may harp on fair competition. At least as long as there are men like Carly?s former colleague, who sent her a sweet ?Back to the kitchen, Carly? note. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arati Ghosh, Calcutta

 Royal matters

 Sir ? Swapan Dasgupta?s suggestion that ?The king?has to be given all the operational assistance in the war against the insurgents? is a dangerous doctrine because it would mean interfering in the internal affairs of a country (?Kingly faith?, Feb 11). Would it not be a better idea to let the Nepalese decide what is best for them? In fact, Nepal should be given adequate aid to improve the standard of living of its people and encouragement to bring in a democratic set-up. As for the Maoists, they cannot be gunned down. Their ideology can and should be countered with a superior one, which in this case would mean democracy. The Maoists are scared of this since they know it will marginalize them. Dasgupta?s fear that the ?greatest danger to national security stems from a Maoist victory in Kathmandu? is unfounded. I don?t think that a tiny Himalayan kingdom can be a source of concern for a huge country like India with its billion-strong population. 

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Swapan Dasgupta may be correct in observing that for India, the defeat of the Maoist insurgency in Nepal should be the immediate and unwavering goal. But it should not be at the cost of democracy. Besides, why is he so convinced that the Maoists are anti-national? Their desire for ?real? democracy, food, shelter and employment forms the core of the demands of much of the population of third-world countries. What is insurgency for the likes of Dasgupta is a revolution to bring about equality and a life of dignity for a majority of the people in Nepal. 

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur 

 Sir ? Swapan Dasgupta seems to suffer from Maoist phobia. He should perhaps be asked to explain China?s success. Or how communism has not prevented Cuba from being one of the world?s largest producers of sugarcane. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sujoy Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? Swapan Dasgupta?s article contained many revelations about the ongoing crisis in Nepal. Other columnists could take a cue from him and come up with credible articles instead of writing on the basis of theoretical assumptions. 

 Yours faithfully,

Partha Mukhia, Darjeeling

 Sir ? Manmohan Singh?s decision to skip the South Asian Association for Regional Conference summit, so as not to be seen in the same company as King Gyanendra, is not only deplorable but also hypocritical. Further, such selective sermonizing reflects poorly on India. When we can deal with a dictatorship in Pakistan, a repressive military junta in Burma, and, above all, the repugnantly oppressive communist autocracy in China, on what grounds do we oppose the goings-on in Nepal? 

 Nepal?s king has constitutional legitimacy and so his decision is, in a way, democratic. It is time we put aside our holier-than-thou attitude in favour of national interest, and dealt with Nepal in a mature fashion, as befits a bigger and powerful neighbour.

 Yours faithfully, 

Shalivahan Sharangpani, Boston, US 

 Sir ? I don?t agree with most of the report, ?Seething youth hope for sanity? (Feb 7). Where were these human-rights activists and the so-called Nepali ?youth? when the Maoists were going about killing innocent people? They, along with the political leaders of Nepal, are the real menace who have caused a fair amount of chaos in the country. What were the leaders doing when they were in power, apart from filling their pockets? Long live King Gyanendra. I hope he succeeds in restoring peace in the country. 

 Yours faithfully,

Nisha Gurung, Kathmandu

 Sir ? King Gyanendra was right to do what he did, considering that he had given a deadline to the Sher Bahadur Deuba-led government to hold polls or tame the Maoist rebels. But the censorship of the media and the suspension of individual liberties should be done away with. And only then can he hope to restore democracy. 

 Yours faithfully,

Deepak Kumar Vidhyarthi, Muzaffarnagar

 Letters to Editor

 Raiders of the lost ark

 Sir ?The considerable damages caused by US-led forces to a heritage site in Babylon is yet another example of American excesses in Iraq (?US accused of Babylon damage?, Jan 16). Not content with killing innocent civilians, they are now trying to efface Iraq?s past. But then what can be expected from a country like the United States of America? A nation without a past has little respect for the relics of an ancient civilization. Remember the looting of the Baghdad museum under the nose of the ?liberating? forces just a little over two years ago?

 Yours faithfully, 

Biswapriya Purkayastha, Shillong

 A dressing down

 Sir ? It is difficult to refute Rudrangshu Mukherjee?s claim that prince Harry has reclaimed his inheritance by sporting a Nazi armband (?Good Prince Hal?, Jan 16). History tells us that some members of the British royal family were of German descent. In the past, flags flying atop royal palaces were embellished with German insignia. British aristocrats were also known by their German names in royal circles. 

 After war broke out between Germany and Britain in 1914, King George V, under pressure from the citizens and the press alike, barred the royals from flaunting their teutonic connections. The emblems and insignia pertaining to that particular country were removed and family names and the titles of peers changed. Not just that, the king even gave a new name for the royal family ? the ?House of Windsor?. These changes, however, were largely cosmetic by nature. Harry?s exploit proves that the royals still yearn for their German roots.

 Yours faithfully,

A.R. Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? Prince Harry?s antic shows that racism is now rampant even among the affluent sections of British society. The influx of a large number of skilled individuals from the subcontinent has made the British youth insecure ? both socially and economically. These insecurities, combined with the cultural differences between the two communities, have forced young people in Britain to harbour ill-feelings towards immigrants. Their antipathy is, perhaps, not dissimilar to what India?s Hindu right feels about Muslims or what the Nazis felt for the Jews. Harry?s brazen display of the Nazi insignia has nothing to do with his ancestry. On the contrary, it has everything to do with his racist outlook.

 Yours faithfully,

Arun Lahiri, London 

 Sir ? Prince Harry deserves every bit of the criticism he is getting for donning a Nazi armband at a theme party. Perhaps it is true that the prince did not pay much attention to his history lessons at Eton. Or have the trappings of a royal life made Harry insensitive to the horrors suffered by the Jews? At least one would have expected Harry to know that public figures like him, unlike ordinary mortals, can seldom get away with an irresponsible act like.

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Pal, Batanagar

 Parting shot

 Sir ? The West Bengal government has been prompt in hiking passenger fares whenever there is a rise in diesel prices. But why does it drag its feet on the issue of passenger safety ? Very little has been done to punish errant drivers who spill blood on the streets. Is the demand of bus unions more important than the lives of the citizens?

 Yours faithfully,

Ashok Sinha, Calcutta

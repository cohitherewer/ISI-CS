 WITHOUT A STAIN

 The law must take its own course ? nothing can be more impeccably right-minded than this noble expression of impartiality and uprightness. So the law did just that, or appeared to, 15 years ago, when a court in Purulia sentenced 25-year-old Ms Malati Bauri of Taljhuri village to life imprisonment on the charge of having murdered her alleged lover. Lacking the wherewithal to fight the case, she got no bail, and the appeal to the high court in 1993 never came up for hearing since she had nobody to follow it up in distant Calcutta. It was through the sense of fairness and duty of a division bench that the case was heard at the high court recently. Ms Bauri was found to be innocent. The court remarked on the inadequacy of the police investigation ? there had been no post-mortem ? and the hasty sentencing ? there was no motive and no proof of guilt. Ms Bauri is now free, with her son grown up and 15 of the best years of her life behind her. 

 What is wrong when the process of law cannot be trusted? Justice may be perceived as an abstract ideal, but laws are created and applied by human beings. It is because of the known danger of individual or group biases and interests sneaking into the functioning of the justice system that there are checks built into it. So procedural correctness is the only way to guard against misuse of the law. It is also the only way to safeguard the rights of a citizen, even if he has been accused, or charged, or convicted. Else the innocent too are left without protection. It is easy to violate rights, that is, procedural propriety, in a state like West Bengal, where most people are unaware of the protection they can claim, and the poor are often terrified, bewildered and without the means to fight back. Ms Bauri?s case is typical of this. The police did not bother about motive or proof, they did not even hold a post-mortem. They were happy to have seized upon a young widow who could be further damned with the tale of an affair with the dead man. 

 But poor rural women ? or men ? are not the only victims of the police?s abuse of power. One unforgettable recent example of it is Avijit Sinha, a young customs official, who had been arrested and interrogated on suspicion of having helped the alleged mastermind of an extremist group. Unable to bear the humiliation and torture of the experience, Sinha killed himself after his release from custody. Ms Bauri would have rotted away in prison had the high court not taken the initiative it did. Her trauma seems to be having a happier ending than Sinha?s. But she has no home and no job. Fifteen years of her life have just vanished. Even though justice has triumphed at last, she is faced with a state which is simply not accountable to its people. Will it ever identify those whose inefficiency, callousness and cruelty have put Ms Bauri where she is today?

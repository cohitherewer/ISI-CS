 Letters to Editor

 Cannabis dreams

 Sir ? So, Prasad Bidappa smoked some, got high and faced the consequences. He, of all people, should have known that the higher you climb, the harder you fall. Nevertheless, it?s sad to see all ?Bidappa?s ?saviours? call his bluff? (July 21), except for the junior Mrs G, and we well know how truly vegetarian she is. It?s funny to see how the mighty have fallen (and been silenced) by two grams of a dried leafy substance. I strongly believe it?s time we returned the long overdue credibility and legality to hemp. At any rate, it is much less harmful than the bottled drug, which despite its legal status is the single-most addictive killer ever imbibed by humans.

 Yours faithfully,

 Patrick S.L. Ghose, Calcutta

 Tread softly

 Sir ? It is almost certain that the Supreme Court?s latest strictures on noise pollution will be ignored, as such guidelines always are (?After tragedy, new war on noise?, July 19). There is also little doubt that these norms will be implemented no better. A far better option is to reform the education system. Concern for the community, environment and humanity has to be taught right from the kindergarten, with occasional practical exercises, by trained teachers. Imbibed from childhood, an awareness of the evils of noise pollution is a permanent, and the only, solution to the problem.

 Yours faithfully,

Subhanjan Sengupta, Durgapur

 Sir ? Similar orders laying down permissible noise-level norms have been passed by various high courts, but they could not be properly implemented, owing to the adamant attitude of religious groups. Take the case in Patna, where the high court judge who ordered a restriction in the use of loud speakers in religious places was manhandled. The apex court should issue instructions to the authorities to prevent such violation. 

 Even during the day, the noise-level of loudspeakers in religious functions should be so fixed that the noise does not disturb the neighbourhood.

 Yours faithfully,

S.C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir ? The Supreme Court?s countrywide ban on the use of loudspeakers, horns and fire-crackers from 10 pm to 6 am will be welcomed by senior citizens and sick people. Es- pecially relieved will be students studying late into the night to prepare for exams. Especially in Orissa, where most marriages take place in the odd hours of the morning, this decision will be a boon in the residential localities adjoining marriage halls. 

 Yours faithfully,

R. Sekar, Angul 

 Sir ? The elite in Indian cities may agree with and abide by the court?s noise-level guidelines but not the poor, living in slums, who have loudspeakers on all day, at full blast, at the slightest pretext. Also, the order can not be enforced unless the politicians agree to abide by it. As the editorial, ?Keep it down? (July 20), aptly says, ?the noisiest people in India are often the most powerful?. 

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? It is a pity that the government has not been bothered about the inconvenience caused to citizens by noise pollution, forcing the apex court to step in with its guidelines. The latter has also done well to preempt opposition from the cracker industry and religious elements, by saying that no religion asks its devotees to cause inconvenience to others. There should be more PILs to reform the problems of this country.

 Yours faithfully,

B.S. Ganesh, Bangalore

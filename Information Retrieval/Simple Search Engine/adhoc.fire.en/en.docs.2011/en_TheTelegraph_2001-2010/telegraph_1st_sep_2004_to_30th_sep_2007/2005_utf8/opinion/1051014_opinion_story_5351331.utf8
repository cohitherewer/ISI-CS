 Paperback Pickings

 The victors and the vanquished

 Forest of the Pygmies (HarperCollins, Rs 295) by Isabel Allende could be a rare treat for those who have had enough of Harry Potter. There is more magic realism here (of the more authentic kind), adventure, and some real knowledge of people living in the remotest corners of the world and relationships. This is the final instalment of Allende?s series for ?young readers? that started with the journeys of Alexander Cold and his journalist grandmother, Kate, in City of the Beasts and the Kingdom of the Golden Dragon. This one is set in the swamps of Ngoub? and takes a look into the world of corruption, slavery and poaching from which even the pygmies in the interiors of Africa have not managed to escape. 

 My Body, My Wisdom (Penguin, Rs 250) by Tripura Kashyap is a handbook that teaches the therapeutics of dance, but one that is most certainly not for beginners. Quite naturally, it addresses ?team leaders?, talks about the props and other logistics that may be used to unlock the creative energies in order to heal both mind and body. But dance, even as a therapy, is better learnt through practice than through prose. Which is why this book, apart from its very positive advice for the way participatory movements can be used to assist people with disabilities, is unlikely to be of great help. And the paucity of illustrations doesn?t improve matters. 

 In the Shadow of the Sun (Roli, Rs 295) by Prafulla Roy is about the underdogs in rural India and their exploitation by all and sundry. There is a jungle-beater-cum-stray-dog-catcher, a bird-catcher, a tiger man, bidi-makers, as also would-be film extras, prostitutes and their daughters and small town thugs, manipulators, holy men and politicians (wonder who all are left out?). The translation is by John W. Hood, who has also translated Roy?s volume on Partition and has a lively interest in Indian contemporary culture, particularly films. The translation however is mediocre and the grammatical errors raise serious questions about the editors in Roli?s employ.

 Comanches: The History of A People (Pimlico, ? 5.20) by T.R. Fehrenbach is about another American conquest but one that took place in the mid-nineteenth century. But this is more about the heroism of the vanquished than that of the victors. Long before they fell to the Texan Rangers and the US army, the Comanches had taken on the Spanish and successfully blocked French advance into the south-west. The Comanches or the North American Indians who lived in the tepees, were master horseback riders, disciplined warriors, the finest makers of arrows and stunning orators who left little of their history in writing. Which is why Fehrenbach?s task of writing their history is made doubly difficult. With the Shoshone language having undergone changes, the original flavour now lost, the legends ?garbled?, the actual history of the Nermernuh, or the True Human Beings, probably still remain out of our grasp. 

 The Tagore Omnibus: Volume one (Penguin, Rs 595) begins, quite predictably, with Chokher Bali, and goes on to include two other of Rabindranath Tagore?s novels, one of which, again, has been filmed ? Ghare Baire and Yogayog. There are two novellas as well ? Chaturanga and Malancha. The translation, however, is not too promising, and fail to do justice to both Binodini?s angst in Chokher Bali and Sandip?s ?unbounded audacity? in Ghare Baire.

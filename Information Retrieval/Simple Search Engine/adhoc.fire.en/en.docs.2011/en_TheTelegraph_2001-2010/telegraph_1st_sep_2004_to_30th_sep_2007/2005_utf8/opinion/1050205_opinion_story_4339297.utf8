 STRIKE

 A

 CHORD

 A stale rock ?? roll trivia to start off with. Who co-wrote the Dire Straits hit Money for Nothing along with Mark Knopfler?

 Few junkies who?ve wanted their MTV at some point of their lives would miss this one. But to all the Bangaloreans who made a beeline to attend the Sacred Love concert at the Palace Grounds last evening, 54-year-old Gordon Matthew Sumner, aka Sting, may have come across as a person who doesn?t mind contradicting himself ? or, for that matter, his lyrics ? when it comes to charity.

 For, the money that the fans coughed up to hear the ex-Police frontman during his first live solo gig in Bangalore wasn?t for ?nothing?. Part of last evening?s proceeds were meant to benefit the survivors of the December 26 tsunami. Just like Sunday?s gig in Delhi will see the bass guitarist-cum-singer drain the rockers in the Capital of a rush of adrenaline and banknotes, with the intention of living and letting live.

 Coming from the teacher-turned-soccer coach-turned-ditch-digger-turned-musician, however, that?s no surprise. It?s an encore of sorts, much like the countless on-stage encores he has belted out in his three decade-long career. A career that has seen him develop from playing the bass in a black-and-yellow sweater (that?s how he got his apian name) to travelling halfway across the world to raise money for survivors of a coastal tragedy. And now he is planning to do a benefit show in Australia, to raise funds for victims in Sri Lanka.

 Sting?s brush with social work sprouted from his long-time association with Amnesty International, a human rights group that the singer once called ?the most civilised organisation? in history. ?I believe in its non-violence? its effectiveness? its dignity and its sense of commitment,? he once said. And like all stars who shine down on lesser mortals, Sting has never flinched from picking up the pieces when he is required to. For the Newcastle-born singer who took up the bass guitar after completing piano lessons from mother Audrey, standing for a cause has been second nature, and there have been causes aplenty.

 If 1984 didn?t end exactly in Orwellian fashion, it saw 40-odd musicians ? Sting inclusive ? turn up at a west London studio to record the single Do they Know it?s Christmas at the behest of pop star Bob Geldof, in aid of those affected by a famine in Ethiopia. The song, released on December 7, was the fastest-selling single ever and raised ?8 million. The Live Aid mega concert followed, held on on July 13, 1985, simultaneously in London and Philadelphia, and with a little help from Sting amp; Co. raised about ?40 million for famine relief.

 Sting parted ways with The Police in the mid Eighties, but not before the band shared top billing with U2 ? the other bunch of Irish do-gooders led by Paul Hewson, better known as Bono ? on Amnesty International?s Conspiracy of Hope Tour, celebrating the organisation?s 25th anniversary in 1986. In 1988, Sting was back to the fore, featuring on Amnesty International?s Human Rights Now! tour, sharing the stage with the likes of Peter Gabriel, Bruce Springsteen and Tracy Chapman. Not content with helping out the malnourished, Sting then turned his attention to those who ?disappeared? during Augusto Pinochet?s reign in Chile.

 For the former jazz enthusiast, environmental protection seems to be as important as human rights. Though one wonders if his passion for all things green was ignited by his initiation to the Amazonian herb Ayahuasca, also called ?dead man?s root?. ?It?s not a frivolous pursuit. It?s not something you?re going to score and a have great time on,? he?d said of the hallucinogenic. If it taught him subservience, his setting up of The Rainforest Foundation in 1989 with wife Trudie could be an obvious outcome.

 Apart from his philanthropy, Sting?s efforts to promote cross-cultural and cross-generic understanding also bore fruit. In 2001, the musician ? who in the past has collaborated with everyone from tenor Luciano Pavarotti to blues wizard Eric Clapton ? was awarded the Kahlil Gibran spirit of Humanity Award for his duet Desert Rose with Algerian singer Cheb Mami. And somewhere along the way came 16 Grammys and the 2002 Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music.

 For the moment, though, it?s Delhi that?s on Sting?s mind. So is Tirupati, if concert organisers are to be believed. But for the ace of bass with a knack for yoga, soul-searching can wait. A cause beckons.

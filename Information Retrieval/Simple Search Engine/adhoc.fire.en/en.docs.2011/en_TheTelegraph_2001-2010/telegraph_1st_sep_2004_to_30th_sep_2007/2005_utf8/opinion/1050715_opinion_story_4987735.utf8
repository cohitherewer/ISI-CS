 Shame and scandal in the family

 Ambani Vs Ambani: Storms in the Sea Wind (Roli, Rs 250) by Alam Srinivas is ?about the internal and external factors ...about unrelated factors that made it impossible for Mukesh and Anil to work together?. The book has a rather interesting dramatis personae, where Pramod Mahajan is described as one ?who was accused of being close to Mukesh and who vehemently denied it?, Shankar Adwal as ?Mukesh?s chief lobbyist in Delhi, he constantly lamented...that the two Ambanis were fighting so openly? and Prem Chand Gupta as ?the minister for company affairs who never revealed his true cards... and kept changing his stance regularly?. From the business editor of a leading Indian weekly, this is quite a thriller, involving most of contemporary India?s business and political players. But ?the final chapter is yet to be written in this saga.?

 After Kurukshetra (Seagull, Rs 120) by Mahasweta Devi collects three stories by the activist writer Mahasweta Devi. All three are based on apocryphal tales from the Mahabharata. What also connects the three is that they are all subaltern (and feminist) readings of the epic. ?The Five Women?, the nishadin in ?Kunti and the Nishadin? and Souvali, the mother of Yuyutsu ? the sole Kaurava brother who sides with Yudhisthira ? are also tribal women, drawn into the central tapestry of the epic from the fringes of society. The stories have been translated from Bengali by Anjum Katyal.

 Parineeta (Penguin, Rs 99) by Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay has made it to most of the recent bestseller lists, thanks to the Saif Ali Khan starrer. The translation, by Malobika Chaudhuri, is in the manner of old English bodice-rippers. The introduction by Swagato Ganguly places the novel in the context of historical, literary and artistic movements of the early 20th century. 

 The A-Z of Bradman (UBSPD, Rs 295) by Alan Eason is for those who thought Don Bradman had been exhausted as a subject for authors and publishers. The A-Z list has entries like ?Abide with Me? (?Jessie Bradman?s favourite hymn?), Calcutta (?where the Don and wife Jessie?s plane made a brief refuelling stop in June 1953?) and Moustache (?adornment of the upper lip sported by the Don for several years in the 1980s?).

 NEW TERRITORY

 A man going to visit his birthplace can be a simple enough affair. But Mr L.K. Advani could not have expected that it would be so in his case, and perhaps he even hoped it would be otherwise. It would not befit the leader of the opposition to proceed on a low-key visit to Pakistan, like Mr Harkishen Singh Surjeet?s, for example. In popular perception, the relationship between India and Pakistan is warmer than it has been in years. It is good to be seen as participating in this exchange of good feeling. But more than that, there is a need to lay claim to the Bharatiya Janata Party?s role in beginning the process of change in relationship. But history demands even more, and Mr Advani has risen to the occasion. Standing before the tomb of Mohammed Ali Jinnah, Mr Advani has acknowledged his greatness, described him as truly secular, and the ?ambassador of Hindu-Muslim unity?. Records show that Mr Advani was not as fond of the founder of Pakistan or quite so appreciative of his qualities as a young man, but the very fact that the old Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh man and BJP leader is now distancing himself in public from the idea of akhand Bharat is indication of his ability to move and change with events.

 Diplomacy demands flexibility, and flexibility is abhorred by hardcore idealists. It is no wonder that Mr Advani?s much publicized comments, made somehow more potent by being pronounced in Pakistan, have deeply pained the RSS. Mr Advani?s admiration goes against the logic and spirit of the belief ? incontestable from the point of view of the RSS ? that Jinnah was responsible for the division and partition of the country. As usual, it is the Vishwa Hindu Parishad that has already started its barrage of threats and abuse, calling Mr Advani both treacherous and greedy ? treacherous to Hindu sentiments in a foreign land and greedy for the prime minister?s post, which is why he is acting ?secular?. Mr Advani has gone the whole hog too. He has called the day of the demolition of the Babri Masjid the ?saddest? in his life. All this bodes discomfort for the Hindutva fraternity, which has so far been used to venting its ire on Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Mr Advani had never disappointed them to this extent. But then, the demands of politics and the aspirations to renewed power cannot afford to trip over ideological shackles.

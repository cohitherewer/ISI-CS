 Out and About

 Just because you win an award that Nobel laureates have won in the past doesn?t mean you?re as good as them. But then, one lives in hope. Siddharth Dhanvant Shanghvi?s debut novel, The Last Song of Dusk, has won Italy?s top literary award, the Grinzane Cavour Prize, 2005, and the young author is ?thrilled beyond measure?. What?s remarkable about Shanghvi?s prize is that Toni Morrison, V.S. Naipaul and G?nter Grass have been earlier recipients. Shanghvi says he ?cannot wait to head for Europe?. For now, it?s Italy. Later, who knows, Stockholm, maybe? 

 Shubha Mudgal

 In the encyclopaedia, classical music is defined as ?music that is not popular?. But it?s poor Shubha Mudgal?s foray into ?pop? music which has made her so, well, unpopular. The classical singer has been receiving a lot of flak from purists who think she?s been diluting her art by teaming up with music bands. The latest bit of criticism comes from an old acquaintance, Sufi singer Madan Gopal Sharma, who has gone as far as writing a letter to request her to keep her classical identity alive. Later, Mudgal cancelled a jingle she was going to lend her voice to. Small wonder.

 Jean-Claude Carriere

 He?s rewritten The Mahabharata for Peter Brooks. And even celebrity writers queue up to learn from Jean-Claude Carriere. The acclaimed French screenwriter was in Delhi this week to conduct a workshop at the NSD campus, attended by the likes of Ruchir Joshi. Never too late to write right.

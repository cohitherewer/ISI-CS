 FALLING OUT OF LINE

 Instead of pursuing Anjali Gupta, the army bosses would do better to investigate more serious corruption charges, writes Gargi Gupta

 Light up their lives

 ?Apart from offering you a career opportunity that is exciting and fulfilling, Air Force offers you an unparalleled way of life? ? promises the official Indian Air Force website to all those women it invites to join its ranks. Anjali Gupta, an MA, MPhil in psychology, must have been moved by similar ambitions to join the IAF as a flying officer. It?s strange that her dream of a life of adventure, of a professional life that did not entail the monotony of a 9-5 desk-bound job, should end in ignominy. 

 Gupta is the first woman officer to be court-martialled since the time women were inducted into the IAF in 1993. The charges against her include taking a road transport allowance of Rs 1,080 with a false statement, claiming train fare for travelling from Bangalore to Delhi despite having used a service aircraft, throwing breakfast meant for a senior officer on the floor and not reporting for physical training and duty on two occasions. These are grave allegations indeed since the effectiveness of the armed forces is premised on strictly maintaining hierarchy, which means unquestioningly and uncomplainingly submitting to whatever your senior asks of you. 

 Gupta broke this unspoken decree when on February 3, she filed an FIR in Bangalore alleging that she had been sexually harassed by three of her seniors. In her complaint, the administration in-charge of the Aircraft and Systems Testing Establishment alleged that they had been keeping her in office till late and had made lewd remarks at her. Gupta may have been desperate ? she had tried petitioning the IAF?s own mechanism for dealing with such cases several times, even approaching the air chief marshal. But by going to the Bangalore police, Gupta broke a third commandment of the armed services ? never take internal matters to civilian courts. In recent times, there have been several cases of this principle being flouted, most notably by the air vice-marshals, Harish Masand and T.S. Chhatwal, who appealed to the Delhi high court against the IAF promotion board?s decision not to promote them. The IAF has had to eat humble pie in this case and create a supernumerary post for Masand. But in the case of Gupta, the IAF higher-ups evidently didn?t like their authority challenged. 

 All women who work in the IAF, of course, don?t have as rough a time as Gupta did ? or if they do, they don?t talk about it, much less approach the courts. Women are also breaking into the upper echelons of the IAF. In 2000, Padmavathy Bandopadhyay became the first woman to rise to the rank of air marshal. There are around 600 of them in the IAF now, one-third of whom are flying officers, who pilot helicopters and transport aircraft. As with the air forces of most countries, a woman is yet to be inducted into the fighting wing of the IAF, though Gunjan Saxena became the first woman to fly into combat zone during the Kargil conflict. Thus, it?s not quite a man?s job that the women IAF officers do, whatever the thousands who apply to join them every year may imagine. 

 In fact, the playing field is far from level. Unlike their male colleagues, women are only taken into the short service commissions, with a service tenure of 10 years. Of course, the experience and training make them valuable in the job market after retirement, which means that they are assured of an income after their stint in the defence forces, even if all they want is to stay on. 

 The problem seems to be one of attitude ? an ingrained bias against the ability of women to bear up to stress and danger. There might be some biological basis to the argument ? women, in general, are physically weaker than men. But there?s no reason why women ? and there must be some ? who can handle the stress and live with the danger, should not be allowed to do so. The LTTE and many Palestinian terror groups make use of women ? although their doing so, in itself, does not make them paragons of gender justice. But neither was the doctor being gender sensitive when he told Surya Moudgil, ?Doctors only see, they don?t touch?, after she protested against there being only male gynaecologists to conduct the physical examination of applicants to the Indian army. Nor the ophthalmologist who mocked her scruples by telling her that for the eye examination, he?d have to come close to her face. There is, of course, something to the argument that Moudgil should have been prepared for the male doctors, but was her plea for a choice between male and female doctors so very unreasonable? Women officers, hardened by training and exposure to the male-dominated officer corps may be blas? about a male doctor examining them internally. But what about a novice? 

 The point is, thus, the unthinking chauvinism of the officers, something that the defence forces will have to find ways to overcome if they want to attract women recruits. One can be sure that the kind of treatment meted out to Gupta will make many female aspirants think twice. The inclusion of two women in the court of inquiry against her may be the army?s way of controlling the damage, but what it needs is a permanent cell to deal with sexual harassment charges ? as the national commission for women has demanded. 

 The allegations about Gupta being denied food of her choice, about not being allowed to meet her mother for more than two hours are, at the very least, not good for public image. And keeping her under ?close arrest? is surely not commensurate with her crime. If recent reports in the media are an indication, the army is sitting on a can of worms. Take Major Surinder Singh, who was dismissed for staging fake encounters on Siachen, or Brigadier R.P. Singh, who was cashiered for diverting funds from the army canteen, or the retired armyman arrested for demanding a bribe from the brother of the first casualty in the Kargil war. The army bosses would help their country better if they investigated more serious crimes like these, instead of making an example of Anjali Gupta.

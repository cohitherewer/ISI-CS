 Letters to Editor

 Boxed out

 Sir ? It is difficult to comprehend why Indians pay so much attention to non-performing cricketers and neglect talented sportsmen like M.C. Marykom. Marykom won a gold in the World Boxing Championships held recently. Since women?s boxing is a medal sport in the Beijing Olympics, Marykom will be an excellent medal prospect for India. Yet, she has had so little support that she says she will be compelled to retire if she is not given a job. And Indians whine about a nation of a billion not producing any Olympic medal winners!

 Yours faithfully,

 Big talk

 Sir ? I don?t think that Andrew Flintoff has attained a level of greatness that gives him the right to criticize a player of Sourav Ganguly?s stature (?Flintoff swings bouncer at Sourav?, Sept 30). A good performance in a one-off Ashes series does not make him a great player overnight. There is no doubt that Flintoff is a player of exceptional talent, but Ganguly is a persevering cricketer too ? his century against Zimbabwe is proof of this fact. Had he been lazy, as Flintoff alleges, he would have been dropped from the side. The comments made by the Glamorgan chief, Paul Russel, also prove that the Indian captain is not as laidback as he is being made out to be. One should also remember that he happens to be India?s most successful captain.

 In an autobiography, a person generally writes about his own experiences. He should not use it to criticize others as Flintoff has done. Ganguly has scored more than 10,000 runs in one-dayers. A lazy player could never have reach such a milestone. It would have made sense for Flintoff to first compare his statistics with Sourav?s before making such puerile comments.

 Yours faithfully,

Moinak Basu, Raniganj

 Sir ? Andrew Flintoffs acerbic comments against Sourav Ganguly are in bad taste. True, cricket has long ceased to be a gentleman?s game, thanks to the intense competition in the sport. But criticizing a current player, that too of another country, is deplorable to say the least. Does Flintoff think that his current good form entitles him to deride other players like Ganguly? Englishmen are known to be a courteous lot but Flintoff seems to have little humility. Suppose Ganguly now decides to speak ill of this English cricketer, should the mud-slinging be allowed to continue? This kind of behaviour surely violates the International Cricket Council?s code of conduct and should be censored.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? England has shown immense strength of character in beating the mighty Australians to claim the Ashes. The English players came across as a confident, accomplished, disciplined and hard-working bunch in their matches against Australia. Players like Andrew Flintoff, Steve Harmison and Michael Vaughan put up a brilliant performance, and it was certainly more entertaining to watch Ricky Ponting and his team of ?invincibles? bow down to English pressure, rather than watch the ?Men in Blue? struggle against sides like Sri Lanka and New Zealand. 

 By virtue of their incredible performance, the English team has been successful in making the home crowd sit up and take notice of them. On the other hand, Team India?s miserable showing has continued in the past year, turning more and more people, including die-hard cricket fans, away from the game. So much so that the winners of the Arjuna Awards this year did not include a single Indian cricketer, who are the best-paid among sportsmen and have a huge fan following. 

 Yours faithfully,

Isha Shah, Calcutta

 Letters to Editor

 Game theory

 Sir ? What luck! The East Bengal coach, Subhas Bhowmick, is not the only income tax officer who is corrupt (?Star coach in bribe net?, Dec 3). There are hundreds of officers like him who promise taxpayers ? who pay their taxes on time and are rightfully entitled to refunds ? to pay back only after a sizeable percentage of the money that is due is paid as bribe. This has become part of the ?system? so much so that it characterizes almost all transactions of public money ? it can happen in the sale of a meagre bus ticket, or the signing of a multicrore defence deal. The operation no longer takes place in secret and there is no giver and taker of bribe because two mutually consenting parties are equally involved in the deal. Bhowmick?s case is unfortunate because in it one party went back on its word. But, possibly, Bhowmick was also trying his luck too hard. Anyway, it is good to see that the Central Bureau of Investigation is working hard, without sparing even a ?celebrity. As for Bhowmick, he should have spared a thought for his public image during negotiations.

 Yours faithfully, 

Bidyut Datta, Calcutta

 Sir ? The report, ?Star coach in bribe net?, is intended more to shock football-lovers than shame the Central excise department for the simple reason that the report puts a misplaced emphasis on the misdemeanours of a public servant. Notwithstanding the fact that Subhas Bhowmick continues to be one of the towering figures of Indian soccer, this singular episode has muddied his name together with that of the football club he is associated with. Bhowmick is more revered as a coach than as a government official. What was found to be particularly jarring (although one has to say that it added to the thrill) was the drama that went with it all ? the mock raid, flight, punches and so on. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? ?Panji EB Coach for Durand Cup? (Dec 5) says that Subhas Bhowmick has conveyed to the president of the East Bengal Club that he would not coach the team till he had proved his ?innocence?. And this despite the fact that he was caught red-handed by the CBI, and there is enough evidence against him. 

 In the current year, investigating agencies have already caught over half-a-dozen superintendents from the Central excise anti-evasion department, where Bhowmick too is a superintendent. Unless stringent action is taken against these erring officials, corruption will continue to thrive in one of the most sensitive departments of the income tax authority.

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 Sir ? In the front page picture of Subhas Bhowmick on the day he was arrested, his timid eyes said it all. His arrest comes as another grim reminder of how deep corruption has spread its roots among civil servants. Bhowmick apparently gets an annual salary of Rs 11 lakh from the East Bengal club. Add to this, his salary as a superintendent of the excise department, and the figure will easily jump beyond the Rs 20 lakh figure. Bhowmick?s indiscretion shows that greed has no limits. I?m not a great lover of football, but I pity my friends who are struck by this news. For them, Bhowmick was nothing less than a superstar.

 Yours faithfully,

A. Sengupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is disturbing that so-called celebrities like the East Bengal coach, Subhas Bhowmick, is causing embarrassment to our society. Though many believe that a deep-rooted conspiracy has felled Bhowmick, the fact that he has been pleading innocent has turned the case against him. His argument that he is not a beggar is ridiculous. The CBI raid on his residences has found assets which are disproportionate to his known sources of income. Which could only mean that Bhowmick has been earning money in the corrupt way. What is worse is to find the authorities treating Bhowmick as someone more equal than others. For what other reason did the All India Football Federation president, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, ask the CBI and the police to ensure that Bhowmick was not tortured in custody? Does Das Munshi spare the same thoughts for the thousands of innocent victims languishing in jail? It is appreciable that East Bengal general-secretary, Kalyan Majumdar, has said that ?there is no question of supporting him. He is a mature and an influential man?. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Star sportsmen are accommodated in government and private jobs to help them earn a living while taking part in sports and games. It also adds shine to the organization which employs them. They are supposed to devote more time to the sports than the duty they are assigned as an employee. Subhas Bhowmick was perhaps doing exactly the opposite. The fact that East Bengal recently suffered many humiliating defeats and Bhowmick took a two-day holiday despite the team?s loss to Ever-Ready for the sake of accomplishing the more important job of conducting a mock raid and collecting a hefty sum from the victim, indicates that he was more interested in making money than coaching East Bengal. While the Central government is inserting huge advertisements in the media requesting citizens to pay their taxes in time, officials clearly want bribe to refund money to taxpayers. The Central excise department and the CBI must ensure that Bhowmick gets the maximum punishment possible for sullying the image of the departments.

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

 NOT ENOUGH

 An economy on the growth path is always hungry for a dose of optimism. For the Indian economy, this is provided by the Mid-Year Economic Review presented by the finance minister, Mr P. Chidambaram, to parliament last week. The review puts the official seal on the good health of the economy ? it underlines the strength of the macroeconomic situation and makes clear that the economy will register a growth of 7.5 per cent for the year. But it is not the statistics that provide the real grounds for the optimism. What is equally important as the figures is the confidence the review generates about the future of the economic reforms programme. The review shows that every sphere of the economy ? inflation, growth, balance of payments and public finances ? is doing fine but it argues that sustaining the health is predicated upon continuing the reforms programme and on taking it forward. There remains a question mark on the issue of taking the reforms forward. The authors of the review admit this and they also express their dissatisfaction about the prevailing climate for investment. This dissatisfaction is based on the low current investment-gross domestic product ratio (26 per cent), the pathetic state of infrastructure and the absence of labour market reforms.

 What is heartening, however, is the growing awareness about these aspects which might hinder sustained growth. The prime minister himself articulated this awareness when he recently called for a review of India?s labour laws. Such a review and the implementation of labour reforms will demand an act of political will on the part of a government that is critically dependent on the left?s support for its survival. But the fundamental issues and the debate concerning them are clear to the prime minister and other policy-framers. This clarity does not always lead to full-throated advocacy or to the countering of specious anti-reforms arguments doled out by the left. But this might be a tactical ploy to allow the left to have its say without actually taking any political action. The optimism of the review and its awareness of the problems facing the economy for sustained growth should not deflect attention from the fact that in India decisions relating to economic reforms are, in the last resort, driven by political compulsions. This consideration alone might offset all the optimism and buoyancy.

 OUT OF COURT

 It may be somewhat reassuring when the stone dropped into a pond has ripples spreading wider than before. At most, that is what can be said of the public interest litigation filed in the Supreme Court against the presence, in a democratic country, of a parallel judiciary based on faith. The PIL appears to have originated in the debate over the fate of Ms Imrana Bibi, who was allegedly raped by her father-in-law. The local panchayat ruled that she should then treat her husband as ?her son? and not live with him, a sentence that was upheld by the powerful Darul Uloom Deoband. Incidents of this kind are not new; what is heartening is that the young woman came forward to complain. But her distress remained stuck in the groove of religious law and debate, and she ended up pleading to be left alone. Two similar incidents were reported immediately afterwards, suggesting that the number and frequency of this particular kind of domestic humiliation are actually completely unknown. The PIL represents a glimmer of hope. Perhaps the time is coming when the issue can be debated sanely, without frothing in the mouth over whose religion is best.

 All religions put women at a disadvantage, silence their voices and appropriate their rights. Society?s urge to keep women powerless is merely given a respectable veneer by hostile interpretations of religious texts when they exist, and of sacrosanct traditional practices and superstitions when they do not. It might be worth counting the number of times the Supreme Court and other courts have pointed out in the last few years what women can inherit, and how, and also that women can dispose of property as they wish. How much difference has that made? The question the PIL has raised is about the legitimacy of a parallel judicial system based on faith. The greatest damage is done when a criminal act is made to look like a ?family matter?. While the question demands immediate attention ? the court has issued notices to the Centre, states and Muslim bodies ? it is also necessary to think beyond the religious aspect. In a ?secular? set-up, for example, in the villages of West Bengal, panchayats and headmen almost invariably punish the women who have been molested or raped. The men might get away by marrying them, or apologizing, or paying a fine. Ultimately, it is this barefaced cruelty that has to be tackled, in whatever guise it is presented.

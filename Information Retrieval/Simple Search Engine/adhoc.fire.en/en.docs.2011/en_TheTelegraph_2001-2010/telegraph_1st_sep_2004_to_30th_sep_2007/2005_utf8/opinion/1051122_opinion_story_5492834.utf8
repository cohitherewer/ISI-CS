 BURNT OUT CASE

 The roots of the recent violence in Paris can be traced to the functioning of the French establishment and the elite, writes Jay Bhattacharjee

 Initiation by fire

 Like corporate commentators who disclose their own stockholdings before assessing individual companies or shares, I must declare my preferences first. It is a seriously Francophile corner from which this battle is being waged ? but the affiliation is more with the language, culture and geography than its inhabitants. It was from my father, who had gone to this wondrous country as an impecunious student in 1925, that I heard of Raja Ram Mohan Roy?s voyage to Europe in 1830 ? when he saw the tricolour on a French ship anchored next to his vessel. Although seriously ill, he insisted on being carried to the French ship. For him, the flag of republicanism and liberty was a precious symbol indeed.

 This was the mythical image of Republican France that Indians treasured for a century and half. Yet the republic has been most erratic in defending (and carrying forward) the ideals on which it was founded. Since 1789, there have been periods during which the republic regressed into monarchy and feudalism. The darkest of all was perhaps 1940-44, when it allowed a vicious and shameful regime to besmirch the fair name of France.

 As the international community watched France erupt into seemingly mindless violence recently, many tried to put forward their own reasons for the events. Understandably, the Anglo-Saxons, led by the American establishment, gleefully went into an overdrive. The schadenfreude was clearly caused by the earlier reaction in France and Europe to the dismal performance of the American state machinery following Hurricane Katrina. The British, unsurprisingly, were at their old game.

 But it is the Indian reaction that is worrying. Commentators have waxed eloquent on the Arab-Muslim angle in the recent events. There has been endless debate on the French obsession with secularism and how this infringes on the sensitivities of the Arab immigrants, the beurs. Admittedly, racism and anti-Arab xenophobia are two of the elements in this explosive mixture, but it is grossly na?ve (and wrong) to concentrate on these two variables exclusively.

 More attentive observers would certainly have realized that at least a third of the rampaging youngsters in France were not Arabs, but the children of black African immigrants and those from the French overseas territories. The latter are, by birth, French citizens and do not require any permission to reside in metropolitan France. As the French football captain, Lillian Thuram, said in response to the inflammatory remarks of Nicholas Sarkozy, the interior minister: ?I grew up in these quarters and I feel very close to these youngsters and I am not scum?. 

 Thuram represents the large population of black French citizens who have also been marginalized and discriminated against for more than a century. In fact, the roots of the crisis are not in religion, culture or political intrigue, but in the very essence and functioning of the French establishment and the elites. Since the revolution, the latter have systematically sought to preserve their privileges and economic clout in the face of populist pressures. The country?s haute bourgeoisie and moneybags have even stooped to outright treason to protect and enlarge their turf. In 1940-44, they collaborated with the Nazi occupiers, only because their experience of the semi-socialist Front Populaire experiment in the Thirties was so distasteful. Going further back, one will find that Europe, about 150 years ago, was shaken by very similar riots in the same suburbs and streets. 

 It has been routine for contemporary sociologists to talk of the ?disappearance of the proletariat? in Western countries . It seems the phantom has returned to the same habitats from where the current middle class started its upward mobility. Today?s working and non-working poor can hardly be expected to swear allegiance to grand Republican values when they look at their miserable state in comparison to the elite. The information revolution has heightened the alienation of the new proletariat. The divide is exacerbated by the fact that the new proletariat and the bourgeoisie belong to different ethnic groups in most cases.

 What is worse, the French establishment in the last few years has miserably mismanaged the country?s economy. The Anglo-Saxon model has led the country?s economic managers to move away from the Nordic model of a market-driven social welfare system. They forgot that the golden years of the country?s economy were from the late Forties to the Seventies, when the Gaullist framework of a capitalist system, guided by a benevolent state-planning umbrella, worked wonders. During these years, there was enough in the national booty to be shared by the population equitably.

 The entire scenario changed because of the venality and corruption of the elite. Private sector greed was matched by extortion of the politicians. The rejection of the European constitution by the French public in the referendum last summer was largely because of the popular resentment against the country?s ruling establishment and the all-pervasive corruption of the elite. With a national youth unemployment figure of more than 20 per cent, it is clear that the French socio-economic structure is in deep trouble.

 The country excels in high-tech industries but manages its basic manufacturing poorly. The standard response of the management when confronted with low-cost Asian imports is to shut down the manufacturing bases in France and shift them to relatively low-cost areas ? east Europe to start with, and now to South America. Factory workers are thus at a constant threat of losing their jobs. The rigidities of the job market also do not encourage employment creation.

 The French state has no doubt tried to alleviate the problems of the less endowed segments of the population. The socialist regimes in the Eighties put in billions of francs to renovate and upgrade social housing and to create employment zones. But these were not sufficient. Funds were not allocated to the more deprived areas, and there is evidence that a substantial portion of the money was siphoned off elsewhere. Moreover, the state initiatives were not matched by the efforts of an efficient private sector and an unselfish bourgeoisie. The burning suburbs in 2005 are its consequence.

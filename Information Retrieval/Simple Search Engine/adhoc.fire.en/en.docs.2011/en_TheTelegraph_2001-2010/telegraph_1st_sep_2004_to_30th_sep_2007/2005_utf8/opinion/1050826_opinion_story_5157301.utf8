 Letters to Editor

 Eastward ho!

 Sir ? Stuck with years of communist baggage that turned West Bengal into an industrial wasteland, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has been systematically trying to open the state?s economy to private investment since 2000. In speeches after speeches to investors, domestic and international, he has been saying, ?Bengal is open to all investors? and ?the mistakes of the past will not be repeated?. He sang the same tune during his recent stopovers at Bangkok and Singapore, en route to Jakarta, where he hopes to entice the Salim Group of Industries to invest millions of dollars in the state. But he must have surprised even himself with his comment that foreign entities could own 100 per cent of the state?s ports and airports, instead of the usual 50 per cent cap on such investments. Even with a caveat ? this arrangement will only extend to new projects ? it is radical enough.

 But the biggest obstacle to Bhattacharjee?s ambitions is the political atmosphere at home. One, there is the CPI(M) politburo, which is extremely suspicious of his economic policies. And second, the political storm that is brewing in West Bengal, with opposition parties and coalition partners vociferously opposing the government?s moves to uproot peasants in order to provide land, especially for the Rs 5.1 billion special economic zone of the Salim group. Perhaps the storm will pass, with at least one party bigwig, Anil Biswas, favouring Bhattacharjee. Interestingly, Biswas has even advocated a shift, en masse, of occupation from agriculture to manufacturing/service industries ? an argument long forwarded by economists and ignored by the cadre. Evidently, Bengal is looking down the barrel ? it must reform to survive. 

 While change is visible in West Bengal, most notably in Calcutta, Bhattacharjee must know that international capital is a coward. It looks for the most generous host and the safest house ? and the two strikes on August 24 by taxi drivers and students unions do not do anything to reassure them that the red flag of Marxism will not engulf their greenbacks in Bengal. 

 Yours faithfully,

Aruni Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? If Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s deal with the Jakarta-based Salim group comes through, 5,100 acres of farmland will have to make way for concrete jungles. Leaving aside the damage to the ecology, how much closer will that take West Bengal to being an industrial powerhouse? So far, the only big project the state can boast of is the Haldia Petrochemical complex. With the passage of time and lack of technological innovations, a number of industries have fallen sick or wound up, leaving numberless unemployed. The prime example of this is the jute mills in Howrah and Hooghly, once the pride of Bengal. 

 Instead of converting agricultural land, why don?t we explore the possibility of utilizing the land occupied by these closed units for farming? If we don?t do this, the land will be grabbed by promoters for real estate development. At least, if it is farmed, the sweat and toil of the farmers will ensure that the land gives returns. But is there any guarantee that this huge pro-ject will not turn sick, given the work culture and hostile trade unionism in West Bengal? Already, a bandh has been called for September to protest against the policy decisions of the ?friendly? UPA government. Is the Salim Group aware of it? 

 Yours faithfully,

Subhankar Mukherjee, Borehat

 Sir ? The West Bengal chief minister seems to have truly transformed himself ? from a communist steeped in Marxist ideology to the investment-friendly poster boy of FDI in West Bengal. His relentless effort to improve the image of the state has just about started to show results in areas like information technology, iron and steel, petrochemicals, leather, real estate. He has successfully put Bengal on the map of different national and international industrial conglomerates. On the other hand, his party general secretary, Prakash Karat, is a known hardliner, lives comfortably in the capital, and is not visible to the masses. Nor does he have any obligations concerning the development of a region. Karat is a party chief, Bhattacharjee is a leader ? that is the key to the differences between the two.

 Yours faithfully,

Kausik Chakrabarti, Haldia

 Sir ? It is strange that CPI(M) ideologues like Prakash Karat and Sitaram Yechury adopt a hardline policy towards foreign investments, while Buddhadev Bhattacharjee, of the same party, is quite convinced that there is no alternative to them. The CPI(M) should espouse Bhattacharjee?s view of globalization and the opening up of the economy, so that the left does not spread any more confusion amongst investors. This can only get in the way of development in West Bengal, and India as a whole. Already, the chief minister has had to answer a lot of awkward questions in Singapore. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir ? The success of the West Bengal chief minister?s ?look east? tour must gladden the hearts of Bengalis everywhere. But I was disturbed by the reactions of the Revolutionary Socialist Party and the Trinamool Congress to his statements. They are like the crabs who will not allow the others to climb out of the pot. They should be sent to developed Asian countries to see how the world has changed. At least, the CPI(M) now realizes its faults and is trying to rectify them. 

 Yours faithfully,

Raja Ray, Port Loko, Sierra Leone

 BAD BOYS? BAN 

 It is impossible to look for the unmentionable in the woodpile when most of the woodpile threatens to be unmentionable. It was not just the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government that refused to consider the Supreme Court?s positive response to a public interest litigation seeking to ban electoral candidates with criminal records. Mr Manmohan Singh has since been accused of accepting ?tainted? ministers too. Now the home ministry?s inter-state council has produced a draft, preliminary to an action plan that would ban aspiring parliamentarians with chequered pasts, and dispose of both corrupt bureaucrats as well as their ill-gotten gains. The intention is noble, the spirit courageous. But the pragmatics of implementation might bear closer scrutiny. Indian politicians have repeatedly shown a marked allergy to ?cleansing?. The arguments they have produced in defence are varied and shifty. The Election Commission has been fighting its unpopular battle against criminally inclined candidates for years. It seems unlikely that a sea-change has taken place among them in the last few months. Perhaps the action plan will also have inscribed in it the strategy to translate intention into policy.

 Besides, a criminal record must be defined quite clearly. A series of unproven allegations cannot technically make a criminal, although, given the realities of the country, a powerful person can get away with crime with more crime. Delays in the judicial process, in-built biases in the police system and social interactions structured by power and fear ? all have to be confronted before criminality is isolated and rejected. The taint runs deep. But according to law, even a person under trial is not a criminal till convicted. Yet, the effort to ?clean up? should not be undervalued. Its success will depend upon clear ideas and practical strategy. But there is still the question of the democratic will. Voters in Bihar, for example, are no fools. While teaching Mr Laloo Prasad Yadav a lesson, they elected known criminals to represent them. What does criminality mean for the people? While banning candidates with criminal records would be good for governance and for image, what would it mean in terms of the electorate?s freedom to choose its representatives? Ultimately, the action plan cannot exist in a vacuum, it must be backed by an efficient criminal justice system.

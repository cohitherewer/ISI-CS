 BACK BEHIND THE VEIL

 Gwynne Dyer

 It doesn?t make sense. In the previous two presidential elections, Iranians voted more than two-to-one for the reformist candidate, Mohammed Khatami. It did them little good, of course, because the Islamist clerics who have veto power over the elected parts of the Iranian government, blocked his attempts to liberalize the system. But it seemed clear that younger Iranians, in particular, were fed up with clerical domination of politics and the corruption, incompetence and oppression it fostered.

 Since the 2001 election, unemployment has got worse and the poor have got poorer. So why have Iranian voters now elected the hardest of hard-liners, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, to the presidency?

 Ahmadinejad is a staunch supporter of the Islamic state, an instructor in the Basij, the voluntary youth militia that monitors people?s dress and behaviour, and a close associate of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Why did he win?

 Rigged verdict

 Iran?s partial democracy first came under serious attack in last year?s parliamentary election, when the ruling clerical elite concluded that the reformers were growing too popular. The Guardian Council disqualified 3,000 parliamentary candidates, including 80 sitting members of parliament, from running on the grounds that they were not Islamic enough. President Khatami?s protests were ignored, parliament fell under Islamist control and Iranians who opposed the regime began to lose faith in electoral politics. 

 The Guardian Council tried to pull the same trick with this year?s election but the opposi- tion responded by threatening to boycott the election, which would have reduced it to a farce. Ayatollah Khamenei intervened, and two reformist candidates were allowed to run together with one ?moderate? (Rafsanjani, former president and a cleric himself) and four hard-liners.

 Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was one of the hard-liners, but only three weeks ago the opi-nion polls gave him a scant 5 per cent of the vote. Then suddenly, a miracle: he was ahead of all the other hard-liners and catching up with Rafsanjani and the reformist candidates.

 On June 17, Rafsanjani came first with 21 per cent of the votes, but Ahmadinejad came a close second. There may have been some skulduggery at the polls, but the main reason is that the Islamic authorities, fearing that no pro-regime candidate would make it into the run-off, ordered their supporters in the armed forces and the Basij militia to swing all their votes, and as many more as they could influence, to Ahmadinejad.

 Tempting fate

 Appalled at the prospect of a radical Islamist as president, the defeated reformers urged their supporters to hold back Rafsanjani in the second round. Yet it ended in a landslide victory for Ahmadinejad.

 His votes came not only from religious radicals, but also from the ?pious poor? who backed him because he is devout but not one of the clerics who have used their powers to enrich themselves. He played up to their hope that he would sweep the corrupt out of government while trying to reassure more sophisticated voters by promising to concentrate on economics, not dress codes. But he is nevertheless the supreme leader?s choice as president, and most people know it.

 But what really happened last week was that a majority of Iranians abandoned the electoral path to reform as hopeless. At some point in the future, they may try the path of non-violent revolution that has succeeded in so many other places recently, and they might win.

 The Islamist regime knows this. It also knows that the only thing that could now restore its credibility is an American attack. It may be tempted to provoke Washington in the hope of getting some American bombs dropped on Iran.

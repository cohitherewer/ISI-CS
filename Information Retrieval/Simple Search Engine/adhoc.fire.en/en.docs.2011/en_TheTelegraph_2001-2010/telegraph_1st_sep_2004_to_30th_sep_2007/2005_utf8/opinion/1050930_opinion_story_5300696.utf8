 WALTZ IN VIENNA

 The left belongs to the past, which, as has been said often enough, is a different country where things are done differently. This is the best defence for the left?s bizarre opposition to India?s vote in favour of a resolution in Vienna at the meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency. The resolution warns Iran about its nuclear programme. The left in India has seen in India?s support to the resolution a betrayal of Iran, allegedly India?s loyal friend. India?s vote is also another instance, according to the comrades, of the pernicious influence that Washington has begun to exert over New Delhi?s policy decisions. This opposition is based on a complete misunderstanding of what drives foreign policy in the contemporary world. The left continues to see the world through the prism of the Cold War, and thus sees ideology as the driving force of foreign policy. The world has changed. Indian comrades have not woken up to this but their counterparts in China have. Reality and national interests determine foreign policy; many would argue that they have always determined foreign policy, which was earlier cloaked by ideology. India?s vote in Vienna had behind it strong practical and national considerations. The left should try to understand this instead of beating a hollow and antique drum.

 The vote in Vienna has to be seen in the context of the understanding negotiated between India and the United States of America during Mr Manmohan Singh?s visit to Washington. The understanding is the product of India?s policy to gain for itself an entry into the world?s nuclear club by demonstrating to the world that India is a responsible power, which does not break its word. Successive regimes, irrespective of their party and ideological orientations, have worked at this policy and represented it at various international platforms and fora. The policy has finally borne fruit and India stands poised to enter one of the world?s most exclusive clubs and be recognized as a global power in nuclear terms. It would be absurd to expect that these gains can be thrown away to keep in tune with some Cold War rhetoric. There is an insufficient understanding, on the part of the left, of the stakes involved here. India?s friendship with Iran is at best fragile and the vote in no way compromises the gas pipeline. There are no other substantial gains to be had from cultivating the regime in Teheran. The harvest lies in Washington. To deny this would be stupid.

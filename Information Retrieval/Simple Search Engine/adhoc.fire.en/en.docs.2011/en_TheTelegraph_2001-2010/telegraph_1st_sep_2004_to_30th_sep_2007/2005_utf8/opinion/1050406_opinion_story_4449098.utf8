 TO GIVE THEM HOPE

 Sekhar Roy

 The plight of the refugees from Bangladesh continues to fall on deaf ears; parties in independent India have played havoc with this immigrant population ? the anguish and hurt were freely expressed at a recent refugee demonstration on the streets of Calcutta. The organizers of the All India Refugee Front in fact felt that the amendment of the Citizenship Act 1971, at the fag end of the Vajpayee regime, had sealed the fate of these people. While the amended act permitted dual citizenship status to NRIs, it compounded the problems of immigrants by making compulsory the registration of all Indian nationals. 

 Those who had to flee their homeland (a large part of them belonging to the minority community) because of religious persecution, destruction of property, rape and killing of their dear ones, have been leading a life of deprivation in India, without a national identity. The harassment by law-enforcing agencies, who treat them more as criminals than infiltrators, has worsened the situation. The rigorous amendment has already been set in action as pilot projects in selected areas in the country through a house-to-house survey and enumeration.

 Moral obligation

 When the amendment to the act was being considered in the Rajya Sabha, Manmohan Singh had reportedly said that it was our moral obligation to consider the circumstances that forced the people to seek refuge in India. That approach was to determine the future course of action. Now Singh heads the government at the Centre and the Refugee Front has requested him to do what is needed for the uprooted. As for the Bharatiya Janata Party, it had assured, in writing, after losing power that it would see that the act was not used against the minorities. But it is yet to admit to its fault of having effected the change in the legislation. 

 The anti-Bangladeshi amendment was done in a calculated manner with a view to appease the secessionist forces in the North-east. It was to help the party make inroads in the region. Advani?s assurance to the house that action against ?illegal migrants?, numbering around 15 million in India, will not be not equated with the minorities has not been kept, as reports prove it. This, in part, is because the earlier provision of rejecting the application for citizenship of those who had applied after March 25, 1971, has been retained in the Citizenship Act.

 Helping hand

 Given the political hypocrisy of the right, it would be most becoming of the present prime minister to rise to the occasion and speak for the persecuted Hindus and other minorities of Bangladesh, and provide them both citizenship and rehabilitation. Singh can honour his prior statement by tabling a new amendment to the act. The democratic and civilized conscience of the nation must demand justice to these people in the light of the United Nations resolution number 428 (V) of December, 1950. It states, ?the refugee is essentially any person who is outside his home country owing to well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality or political opinion.?

 The influx of refugees continues, given the systematic persecution of the minorities by fundamentalist forces in Bangladesh, where the Hindu population has come down to 7 per cent from 29 per cent 50 years ago. Human rights organizations and international bodies have already raised their voice against the systematic liquidation of noted opposition leaders, leftists, former ministers, journalists and eminent writers in that country. The forces India defeated in 1971 have become stronger than ever before. While the talibanization of Bangladeshi society goes on, India can provide a helping hand to its persecuted population, in keeping with its noble principles.

 LEFT HIGH AND DRY

 Water resources in and around Santiniketan are under threat from unplanned development projects, writes Satyesh C. Chakraborty

 Water, water, nowhere

 That this is a myth can be checked from the ?Final report on the deep well drilling in the Bolepur Project Area?. This report was submitted as early as May 1998 by the consultants engaged by the public health engineering department of the government of West Bengal. Based on the same consultants? detailed project report, the currently operating water supply system ? known as the Indo-German water supply project ? was implemented. The consultants had pointed out that the groundwater stock is limited.

 Apparently, the SSDA has not given due consideration to the limitations of the groundwater resources mentioned in this report while preparing its land use plan or is deliberately suppressing the findings from the current users of drinking water supplied from the Indo-German water scheme. The scheme serves the Bolepur municipal area and the Visva-Bharati campus in addition to many villages in the neighbourhood. The gravity of this lapse can be seen from the fact that one of the promoters of a housing project, approved by the SSDA, disclosed in a public hearing meeting held in Suri on June 28, 2005 that 74 kilo-litres of water per day would be drawn from the same aquifers that the Indo-German water project is tapping. The promoter is placing this demand without working out the water balance calculations, implying that he does not care about what happens to the existing users of drinking water after withdrawing his requirements. No wonder the West Bengal pollution control board has rejected the environment impact assessment report submitted by that promoter and has demanded full calculation on the water balance in their revised EIA report. This decision of the WBPCB is justifiable and citizens need to be apprised of their right given under the principle of prior appropriation of water resources, which is a guarantee that no subsequent user can impair the established rights to water of the earlier users.

 The depositional environment on the aquifer sequences has been described in detail in the report submitted by the consultants. The sedimentary strata of this area was deposited during the late Tertiary and early Quaternary deltaic environment. In the western part, near the Bolepur-Sriniketan area, gravel and sand of continental facies were deposited in alluvial valleys with the advancing head of the delta. In the eastern part of the Bolepur block, finer materials, typical of near shore environment, were deposited. The currently eroding lateritic bluffs of low height probably represent the ancient shoreline or suggest that it was nearby.

 Impervious clay beds on top and bottom have kept the aquifers, made of layers of relatively coarse materials like gravel and sand, somewhat confined with gentle slope from northwest to southeast. Along this slope, the groundwater flows. The recharge zone is a little distance to the west of the Bolepur area. But water flowing through the gently sloping aquifers escape from the area steadily after the rains with the velocity declining as the dry season advances. This means the capacity of the aquifers to supply water declines after the rains. The Indo-German water project draws water from the second and the third layers of water-bearing strata, leaving the upper aquifer undisturbed for exploitation by dug wells and to avoid impairing farming or irrigation.

 The second and the third layers of water-bearing strata in the eastern part from near Surul in the north to Kankutia in the south have been partly cemented by filling of calcite type materials deposited after sedimentation. The eastern aquifers are not cemented. Locally confined impregnation of pyrite found in the western field is due to hydrothermal solutions derived from the underlying granite. To the west of Bolepur, there are the well-known hot springs of Bakreswar. The presence of pyrites warns us that infiltrating air into the aquifers after heavy withdrawal of water is capable of oxidizing materials and may convert these pyrites into arsenates. Before the project was commissioned, arsenic in ground water was found to be around 0.01 mg per litre, which should be used as a datum to ascertain changes emerging from withdrawal of water after commissioning the project.

 The limiting factor of 20m drawdown was set to determine maximum yield and was agreed to by the PHED. But the safe limit of extraction was fixed at 75 per cent of the maximum yield to provide a security margin for the seasonal fluctuations of flow. The rated capacity of the wells in the western part of the region was found to be 125 cubic metre per hour at 20m drawdown. That for the eastern wells was found to be 79.2 cubic metre per hour at less than equal to 20m drawdown. But the ratings vary between the wells from 146.5 cubic metre per hour less than equal to 20m drawdown at Chandanpur in the west to 31.5 cubic metre per hour at less than equal to 20m drawdown in the east.

 The situation becomes further complicated when the effects of withdrawal of water from one well upon the adjacent well are examined. It was found that this effect is more pronounced in the western part than in the east. This means that the drawdown will be higher when all wells will be operating in full capacity than the calculated figures obtained from extraction of water from the individual borewells. As a result, there will be varying orders of infiltration of oxidizing air into the aquifer and ultimate collapse of the structure, notwithstanding formation of arsenates in the western field.

 Considering the critical disposition of the aquifers in the Indo-German water project area, the consultants had warned that caution is to be practised while exploiting the water resources. They had issued a number of recommendations, none of which are followed by the exploiters after the commissioning of the project. In the first instance, it was recommended that the dynamic water level should not be ignored and, for that reason, all bore-wells must have electrodes to automatically shut off the pumps as water goes below the prescribed level. All wells should be provided with water meter and piezometer pipes to measure yield and to record the placement of the water level respectively. These records are to be analysed regularly to modify the recommended yield rates. It would be necessary to ascertain whether abstraction of ground water from the deeper aquifers is having any adverse impact upon agriculture and irrigation. It was further recommended that the quality of the extracted groundwater should be tested before and after every rainy season. There is no evidence that these recommendations are being followed.

 The reason for disregarding the warnings is simple to comprehend. The prevailing culture of neglect of maintenance pervades all public institutions in India. In addition, the PHED has made the situation more complicated by partitioning an otherwise unified field of aquifer hydrology in terms of several operating agencies. The Bolepur municipality operates all the borewells located within their jurisdiction. The SSDA is operating the wells within its domain. The wells supplying water to the rural settlements are operated by the PHED. Between these three institutions, the tasks of observation, record-keeping, data analyses, controls on over-extraction of water, and so on have become nobody?s business. 

 There are indications that the recommended norms on water extraction are being violated. Within the Bolepur municipality, for example, some borewells are lying defunct, which is claimed to have been caused by infiltration of sand through the filters. The consultants had cautioned that sand infiltration can happen if the hydraulic gradient becomes steep due to extraction of water above reasonable limits. 

 These facts are mentioned only to caution the dreamers that it is not possible to cross the limits of natural endowments to fulfil unfettered human ambitions. The tracts around Sriniketan, Santiniketan and Bolepur cannot support a large settlement based on industry. Therefore, how large the settlement should be and what functions should be assigned to them are matters that need critical assessment. For this, the SSDA should not be seen as a competent organization.

 Letters to Editor

 Action, reaction

 Sir ? The discord between the government and the Supreme Court over reservations in unaided educational institutions is distressing. The courts have handed down three conflicting judgments on the issue in the last one year. This is also not the first time that the courts, ruling on one issue, have come out with conflicting decrees. It seems that these judgments were delivered without taking into consideration all the positions on the matter. Perhaps this is the reason why cases remain unresolved in our courts for years together. 

 Further, the chief justice?s outburst, especially his comment that the executive may consider closing down the courts, was unwarranted. His statement that the legislature and the executive did not understand the judgment seems to assert a belief in the superiority of the judiciary. This is insulting to the two other arms of Indian democracy. If they do not understand the judgment, is it not the responsibility of the Supreme Court to clarify it since it concerns such an important social issue? 

 Increasingly, in the past few years, the judiciary has been attracting adverse comments relating to impropriety, corruption, incompetence and the like. In reply to all these allegations, the judiciary tends to shut itself in its ivory tower and state that it is beyond question. This is nothing but a colonial mindset and it is time we got rid of. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Kamat, Alto Porvorim, Goa

 Sir ? Whenever the courts pull up our politicians or deliver orders that go against them, the latter retaliate by asserting that the legislature is supreme and that the courts can?t usurp its jurisdiction, or take the legislating route to circumvent judgments. Even before the latest fracas over quotas in ?unaided? institutions, this pattern could be discerned in the bungling over the installation of Shibu Soren as Jharkhand chief minister, and the imposition of president?s rule in Bihar. There was a time, perhaps in the first ten years after independence, when Indian legislators could claim moral superiority, since they were largely honest, patriotic and were in politics to serve the people. Now, most of them are either corrupt or hungry for the power and the money. For most citizens today, the Supreme Court is far superior as it consists of educated and experienced men who ensure that common people get justice. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? By attempting to draw up a law to turn down a Supreme Court verdict, what message are our politicians sending out? Muslims leaders have said that they will go by the Supreme Court on the Babri Masjid issue. If the judgment goes against them, will they still be expected to abide by it, given the damaging precedent? Why do we forget that the Supreme Court is meant to act as a check on the legislature? If our leaders don?t respect the highest court how can they expect a common man to do so? Will it not be the beginning of the end of democracy?

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

 Sir ? There has been friction between the legislature and the judiciary in the past as well, but it has never reached such a flashpoint. Several leaders, especially from the left, have gone overboard in their criticism of the court decision. While the government can enforce reservation ? even if it is blatantly for votebank considerations ?- it cannot do so in a haphazard manner. And if it wants a ?committed judiciary?, it has to make sure that its policies stand the test of the law and are faithful to the Constitution.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The report, ?Justice throws up hands? (Aug 24), depicts the unfortunate results of the rise of politicians who are impervious to all sense of decency and do not hesitate to openly criticize the highest judiciary or nullify its orders by passing legislations The five per cent reservation for five years in government jobs, as originally contemplated by the fathers of the Constitution, now has become a much-inflated figure and a permanent fixture in the statute. As if this were not bad enough, the politicians now want this to extend to the non-governmental sector too without assessing if the benefit is really percolating down. The Supreme Court?s earlier efforts to exclude the ?creamy layers?, so that the hitherto excluded people would be benefited, did not find favour with them. Are the judges then to be at the beck and call of the politicians? If the latter are allowed go on like this, the country would soon face a chaotic situation. 

 But the judges must not throw in the towel. They must work to protect the interests of the people, as they have been doing thus far, disregarding what the politicians do or say. If the politicians had the vision to see it, they would discern the scant respect in which people hold most of them. It is fear that prevents an outward manifestation of their real feelings. But for how long will that fear last?

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The only institution that works in India is the judiciary It is not the courts that are in the wrong in trying to engineer a confrontation with the government; it is the government which has been interfering with the legal process by protecting criminals. But the courts too cannot be absolved of the failure to punish political criminals like Laloo Prasad Yadav, Mayavati, Mohammad Sahabuddin who proudly sit in our legislatures. The Supreme Court should take action against these political crooks or close down the courts.

 Yours faithfully,

 Diptendu Chakraborty, Toronto

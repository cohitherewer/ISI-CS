 INTIMATE ABUSE

 Protection, especially in the law, is often a double-edged weapon. To ?protect? a woman, or a child, can work along, as well as against, the grain of an oppressive society. The new domestic violence bill cleared by the cabinet extends its idea of protecting women by widening the scope of the law in two important ways. First, the bill applies not only to married women, but also provides legal protection to ?sisters, widows, mothers, single women or [women] living with the abuser?. This corrects the Indian Penal Code?s exclusive concern for violence within marriages by including less conventional forms of cohabitation, blood ties and adoption. Second, the definition of violence will now include ?actual abuse or the threat of abuse that could be physical, sexual, verbal, emotional and economic?. This takes the bill beyond the ?habitual offender? ? one of the most objectionable elements in its previous versions ? and also includes sites of violence like the workplace, apart from the matrimonial home, in which, too, the woman?s rights have been more firmly secured by the bill. More generally, this shift is from the criminal to the civil, from offence and punishment to rights and protection. 

 It cannot be ignored, however, that it was only in 1983 that the IPC first recognized domestic violence against women as a criminal offence, and it took another couple of decades of persistent activism and advocacy for a proper bill to be cleared. And the actual situation in India remains grim. A woman is assaulted every five minutes in India, according to a recent survey conducted by the World Health Organization. Micro-studies in Orissa, for instance, report frightening levels of abuse within the home in the districts and villages, among physically and mentally challenged women especially. A law exists, to a very great extent, in the realm of the ideal. A disconcerting number of Indian men, across the social spectrum, think that beating a woman up is a proprietorial right. An equally disconcerting number of women still feel that husbandly violence is natural, deserved and sometimes even an expression of love. Also, most of all this will be going on behind closed doors, and will take place in brutal and blatant as well as subtle and intimate forms. Bringing the private out into the realm of public justice requires a kind of empowerment that cannot be provided just by the law.

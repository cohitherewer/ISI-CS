 Paperback Pickings

 The passing of the eccentrics

 Scenes of Aca-demic Life (Penguin, 70p) by David Lodge is a truly featherweight personal selection from the writer?s famous ?campus novels?, starting with The British Museum is Falling Down (1965), and going on to include immensely entertaining and often prophetic sections from such minor classics as Changing Places, Small World and Nice Work. In his excellent foreword, Lodge traces the campus novel back through Mary McCarthy and Kingsley Amis (with Lucky Jim, 1954, the genre crossed the Atlantic in its modern form) to Shakespeare?s ?courtly campus play?, Love?s Labours Lost. What Lodge?s own novels document is an actual change in academia on either side of the pond, succinctly summed up by him: ?The massive expansion of British higher education, Thatcherite economics, and the hegemony of ?management? in every sector of society, have forced our universities to adopt American-style modular courses, largely abandon traditional tutorial teaching, and purge their faculties of the amusing unproductive eccentrics who once found a comfortable home there.?

 Ten of Us (Frog, Rs 125) by Manjira Majumdar and Ishanee Sarkar is subtitled ?Jottings from the Diary of an Indian Urban Teenage Girl?. Majumdar creates the diaries around Sarkar?s poems about the members of her family, written when she was in her early teens. Their notion of the Indian urban teenage girl is somewhat predictable ? loves rock music, doesn?t like studying, pet-dog called Dotcom. The introduction sums it up: ?Nuclear families, working parents and hi-tech aids like computers, mobile phones and digital notebooks. Is life any easier? Maybe yes. Maybe no. The Modern Day Teenager walks in same Nikes and Reeboks; they wear designer t-shirts. And sound the same. I mean duh ? what a dork! Stuff like that. But they are here to stay.? Perhaps this is too much of a summing up.

 The Trial of Bhagat Singh (Oxford, Rs 295) by A.G. Noorani is a new edition of a 1996 ?study in the politics of justice?. The hanging of Singh and his associates at the Lahore Central Jail in 1931 was the culmination of the Lahore Conspiracy Case, one of the most controversial trials under the raj. The book reveals how the executive and legislative branches of the raj conspired to ensure the miscarriage of justice.

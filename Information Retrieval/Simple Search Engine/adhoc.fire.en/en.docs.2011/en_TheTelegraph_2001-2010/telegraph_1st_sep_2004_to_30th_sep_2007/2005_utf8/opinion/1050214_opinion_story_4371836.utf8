 RALLY ROUND

 A party in power for 28 years develops a confidence unmatched by any but the most arrogant dictators. This was on display once again last Saturday, when Calcutta ground to a grating halt in order to accommodate the thousands of ardent followers that the Communist Party of India (Marxist) had unleashed on the city. The processions took over roads and flyovers, blocking them from pavement to pavement, completely ignoring court orders about leaving one side of the road free for passage. Trucks loaded with supporters filled up all passable space, while auto-rickshaws, minibuses and buses were simply not available in many areas. For hours during the busiest part of a working day, nothing moved but CPI(M) supporters. Like each time before this, ambulances were stuck too, or excruciatingly delayed, with critically ill patients inside them. The police tried to be helpful, not to much avail. Their?s was not to question the ways of those who rule the state.

 The confidence of the party is manifested best in its unshaken belief that it can fool all the people all the time. The promises of a better Calcutta, of a more orderly civic existence, of the city?s rebirth as the most inviting investment destination, all begin to sound like a bit of a joke. And after a series of such experiences, they mean nothing at all. The complete indifference to the ordinary man?s needs that the party shows ? shrugging off his need to get to work or do his mother?s shopping, to deliver goods on time or catch a train, to do something mundane, or urgent, or simply dutiful and responsible, to take his child to the doctor or pick him up from school ? is reflected in its supporters? behaviour. They block roads, they do not pay the toll at Vidyasagar Setu. When a party exhibits its power by disrupting normal life, its supporters cannot be expected to be law-abiding citizens.

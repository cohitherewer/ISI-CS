 Letters to Editor

 Many voices

 Sir ? Why should the spectacle of Rabri Devi speaking at a public meeting be news suddenly (?No longer a rookie, Rabri finds her voice?, Feb 21)? If Sonia Gandhi is deemed to have come of age and given Mahatma Gandhi stiff competition, why should Rabri Devi?s speech to her deshwalas be cause for surprise? Does the lack of expectations of her betray a male bias in the way women in politics are looked at, or worse, a bias against dehati woman in politics? Whichever way you look at it, the women, be it Sonia or Rabri, have never been without a voice (so the question of ?finding? one does not arise). It was Sonia?s choice that determined her husband?s involvement in politics, and in Rabri?s case, her approval surely would have counted in her own involvement and that of her family in Bihar?s politics. So the next time Rabri is crowned queen, give her what is her due.

 Yours faithfully,

N. Sridhar, Calcutta

 Getting under the skin

 Sir ? The report, ?Strip threat to entertainment? (Feb 18), shows that some of us will never grow up and learn to take control of our lives. The two blacklisted women, Negar Khan and Mumait Khan, have excellent bodies and if they can motivate their kind to remain slim and trim, I don?t see why the government should take exception. Some people have reportedly complained to the police, saying that certain programmes cannot be watched with other members of their families. But whoever asked them to watch these programmes with their family in the first place? Do they do all other entertaining things in life in the presence of their family? And given that the boon of liberalization gives us the choice of watching so many channels, why stick to a few? If they think television is the best way to stay together, why can?t they watch infotainment channels like Discovery, Animal Planet, National Geographic, Cartoon Network or even our own unimaginative DD.

 I am the father of a college-going kid, and both of us love to watch MTV, though not necessarily together. It is an assertion of our individual liberty, a matter of ?choice?, which is vital both for the survival of ourselves and our democracy. And we are not ready to lose it under any circumstances. 

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Pal, Batanagar

 Sir ? The new government?s ?detoxification? drive ? read its attempt to overturn the previous government?s prudishness ? is ruining our society. Thanks to it, the overtly sexual has come to dominate films, television and even our daily lives. The editorial, ?No evenings in Paris? (Feb 19), by ridiculing the United Progressive Alliance government?s first drive to regulate such matters, adds to the damage. Sharmila Tagore, who heads the censor board, should be criticized, not for permitting self-regulation but for not doing enough to impose rules on private TV channels that promote porn. A majority of the soap operas, music videos, remixed songs and crime reports adversely affect the minds of teenagers. Extra-marital relations, multiple partners and indecent exposure have become their staple diet. One might argue that all this is related to the market economy, and the film-maker and channel managers are trying to make the most of it. But isn?t the government in any way responsible for the mental well-being of its people?

Yours faithfully, 

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur 

 Sir ? The editorial, ?No evenings in Paris?, hits bull?s eye. The ?liberal? Congress is setting the same standards as the ?fascist? sangh parivar. The doublespeak on censorship is not the only instance of this trend. In Congress-ruled Mumbai, the police have cracked down on dance bars despite these being licensed, tax-paying and legitimate businesses. Female customers were arrested on charges of prostitution since the police could not take recourse to any other law for holding up adults visiting legitimate entertainment spots. And men were causally arrested en masse because in contemporary India, such things are passed off as ?the law taking its course?. No questions are asked, no alibis required and no accountability assigned. In another Congress-ruled state, Andhra Pradesh, the Hyderabad police is supposed to have pursued a mixed gender picnic party to its venue and arrested all its participants on charges of obscenity. Besides, the Congress has already ordered the closure of all entertainment spots by 9 pm. Way up in Jammu and Kashmir, which has a Congress-backed state government, Anara Gupta?s ordeal has become a national shame. In Delhi, the Congress government bit off more than it could chew when it arrested the chief executive officer of bazee.com for a mobile phone video clip which showed two teenagers having consensual sex.

 But even all that put together cannot beat the left. Back home in Calcutta, Avatar Singh?s hotel was raided with the noble intention of apprehending the comrade-turned-bad-boy Hathkata Dilip. Then the police chanced on a ?sex racket? and put Singh behind bars for being part of the ?orgy?. Long live democracy. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sandeep Mukherjee, Calcutta

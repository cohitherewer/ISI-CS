 Two Rajas of art

 RAJA RAVI VARMA: PORTRAIT OF AN ARTIST (Oxford, 

 Rs 2,250), edited by Erwin Neumayer and Christine Schelberger, brings alive ten years mdash; 1894-5 to 1905 mdash; in the life of this Indian painter through the diary of his brother, C. Raja Raja Varma. Raja was Ravi rsquo;s co-worker, secretary and business manager. He started keeping these journals as a travelogue during a tour with Prince Martanda Varma in 1894, and gradually filled it with the affairs of the Ravi Varma Fine Arts Lithographic Press. This edition adds a colour-plate section of photographs, paintings, drawings and illustrations from art magazines of the period. On the left is a double portrait, by Ravi Varma (c. 1880) of Amma Koil Thampuran, a matron from the Mavelikara court, and her niece. Top right is a photograph (c. 1898) of the Ranis Parvatibai and Lakshmibai, Ravi rsquo;s granddaughters. Below it are the two brothers working in their Bombay studio.

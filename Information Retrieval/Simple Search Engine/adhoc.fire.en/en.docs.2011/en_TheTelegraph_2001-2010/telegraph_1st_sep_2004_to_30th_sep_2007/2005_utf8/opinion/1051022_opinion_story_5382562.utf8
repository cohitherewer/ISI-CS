 Letters to Editor

 The chosen one

 Sir ? Sania Mirza seems to have everything going for her. Now she has a world-famous coach willing to take her under his tutelage for the Australian Open next year (?A dash of Roche Tonyc for Sania?, Oct 20). Sourav Ganguly may argue otherwise, but coaches do matter. They set the tone of play, install systems, keep players happy and help players interact with the media. Despite their importance, coaches often do not figure in the career summary of players. Let us hope John Farrington also finds a mention with Roche when one talks about Sania?s game in the future. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Barthakur, Guwahati

 Run for cover

 Sir ? Having read the report, ?IAS officers run from Bihar poll job? (Oct 10), I have a humble suggestion for the Election Commission. I am prepared to go to Jehanabad or Jamalpur or Chapra ? that is anywhere in the backward, incorrigible, hopeless state of Bihar for the subsequent phase of electioneering. I have absolutely no problem whatsoever, being a former soldier of the Indian army, that too from the crack Gorkha Battalion, known as 2nd Battalion-3rd Gorkha Rifles, Queen Alexandra?s own. Above all, I served with the Ten Assam Rifles in Nagaland for two years (1969-71). I really feel perturbed that my colleagues and fellow officers of the Indian administrative services of the West Bengal cadre are trembling at the thought of being sent to Bihar. The time is now ripe to bring into force the Civil Act, 2005 like the Army Act of 1950, to instil discipline in the IAS too. If I am not incorrect, there must be at least 100-odd retired officers from the IAS who had earlier served with the army as emergency commissioned officers or SSCOs during 1967-74. Those who are alive must be physically fit and mentally alert to go on election duty in Bihar.

Yours faithfully, 

T.V. Venkataraman, Calcutta 

 Sir ? It is amusing to read the report about IAS officers in Bengal bunking their Bihar poll duties, and asking for ?mercy?. The report justifiably highlights the officers? greater concern with the comfort, the amenities available in circuit houses and perquisites like trips abroad, than with their official duties. Given the scourge of comfort-loving civil servants, is it not time for the Union Public Service Commission to think of ways to recruit a non-hedonistic cadre to fight violence and lawlessness? 

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir ? Malvika Singh?s observations about babudom taking advantage of ?archaic structures, rules and norms within which to operate? can be evinced in the great reluctance of babus to acknowledge letters sent to them, much less reply to them. On February 28, 2005 the Bharat Sevashram Sangha, Pukuria (Jhargram) submitted an application to the Union ministry of tribal affairs through the state government for grant-in-aid for a mobile dispensary, hostel and carpentry for the benefit of local tribals. The application, along with the prescribed forms, was sent down from the state minister and principal secretary of the backward classes welfare department to the district magistrate and project officer-cum-district welfare officer, West Midnapore. Despite the innumerable letters written to all these officers, and even to the chief minister, we are yet to get a reply as to when our application would be forwarded to the Union ministry. Yet every now and then the chief minister exhorts NGOs like us to come forward and do something to alleviate the misery of tribals (we have a colony for 44 Lodha Sabar families) so that Amlashole does not recur. It would be foolish to believe that with such an insensitive bureaucracy, the government would ever be able to implement the rural employment generation scheme.

 Yours faithfully,

 Bani Kumar Banerjee, Jhargram

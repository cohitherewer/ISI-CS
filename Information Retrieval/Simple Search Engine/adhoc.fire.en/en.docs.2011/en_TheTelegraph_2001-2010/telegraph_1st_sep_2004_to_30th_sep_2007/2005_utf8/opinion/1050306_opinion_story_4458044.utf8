 PRINCE AND THE PEOPLE

 The Prince of Wales has been in the royalty business long enough to realize that he has no private life. His riding with the hounds and his roll in the hay with Ms Camilla Parker-Bowles are always in the public glare. This is an unavoidable part of royal life. It is now learnt that the heir to the British throne has expressed his grave disappointment with the harsh treatment the British people have meted out to him. The prince was referring to the British people?s apparent lack of compassion regarding his relationship with Ms Parker-Bowles. The people?s disapproval of his personal life has hurt the prince. The thought has not occurred to him that his personal life may not have met the expectations of the people who look up to him as a future monarch. The British people?s attitude to Prince Charles and his love life was evident in the long line of mourners at the funeral of his divorced wife and the flowers the people left in her memory. The compassion of the British people was in full display for Princess Diana. The Prince of Wales cannot afford to forget that his relationship with Ms Parker-Bowles began when he was still married to Diana, and the people of Britain have perhaps not forgiven him for that. Princess Diana, for better or for worse, had struck a chord in the hearts of the British people. Ms Parker-Bowles, once memorably described as a rottweiler by Diana, only revives that memory and that respect and hence their disapproval.

 By articulating his anguish, Prince Charles has expressed perhaps an unconscious desire to be a people?s prince. He is seriously concerned about what his subjects think of him and his private life. This is where he cuts a different and even a sorry figure. Most of his predecessors gave a tinker?s damn about what the people thought of their ways. The redoubtable Queen Victoria carried on her relationship with her groom, John Brown, with aplomb. Another king, Edward VII, kept a mistress who happened to be Ms Parker-Bowles?s great-great-grandmother. Lady Edwina Mountbatten, the wife of Prince Charles?s role model and exemplar, Lord Mountbatten, was more known for her liaisons than anything else. They did not care what hoi polloi thought of their various activities, let alone be upset by public opinion.

 Whether Prince Charles likes it or not, there is a screen that separates the royalty from the people. A people?s prince is a contradiction since no reconciliation is possible between monarchy and democracy. The British political system attempts such a reconciliation but it does so by reducing the monarch to a rubber stamp. Prince Charles can look forward to this future without thinking about public opinion. The opinion of the people can only further erode the mystique that helps the monarchy to survive. In a constitutional monarchy, a prince has very few clothes to wear.

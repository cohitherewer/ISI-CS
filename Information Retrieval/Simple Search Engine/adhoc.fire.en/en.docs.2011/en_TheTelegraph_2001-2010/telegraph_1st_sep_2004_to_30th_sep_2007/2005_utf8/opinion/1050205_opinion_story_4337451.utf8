 MADAME?S TWO FACES

 ?Where there is wine, there?s civilization,? a famous Bordeaux vigneron likes to say. But the grey laws of wholesomeness are usually at odds with such civilization. A ridiculous drama of double standards is being played out on the billboards of France. Ms Catherine Gachet has been chosen as the face that would promote Bordeaux wine for a national advertising campaign. She is a highly successful wine-maker and also a very beautiful woman. But the French courts have outlawed one of the two images used in the campaign. The one in which she holds a glass of wine close to herself with an alluring look in her eyes has been vetoed by the law. Only the other one ? in which the glass is held further away, as she flashes a milkmaidish smile ? may be used. The second is more wholesome and less enticing. The logic of the law in France is simple: alcohol is bad for health, so it cannot be made to look attractive when being advertised. This law had been passed in the early Nineties by a Socialist minister. It only allows the use of ?objective characteristics? in the promotion of alcoholic products, and bans the use of ?qualitative? material. The pleasure or desire produced by the product cannot be represented in any way. Even the use of models to promote wine is forbidden. Hence, the clever choice of a beautiful female wine-maker to get around this law. (And a wine-maker whose vineyard, south-east of Bordeaux, happens to be called Chateau Bastard.)

 With 45,000 alcohol-related deaths per year, France has an actively lobbying national association for the prevention of alcoholism and addiction. The law that was used against Ms Gachet?s expression and posture is the triumph of this lobby, opposed by a clutch of MPs and pro-winers who are gravely and angrily concerned with the ailing of the French wine industry. ?We are moving more and more,? Ms Gachet has remarked, ?towards legislating for anything but the good life.? Hence the utter absurdity of the state taking it upon itself to decide whether the look in somebody?s eyes is dangerously enticing or safely objective when the product being sold is considered dubious. The wholesome intentions of the welfare state are therefore unable to make distinctions within forms of alcohol (wine and whisky are under the same law) and kinds of addiction (alcoholism and wine-drinking become the same thing). In the process, an entire nation of adults ends up being policed like a bunch of errant teenagers. Ms Gachet and her league of bacchants see this triumph of virtue over pleasure as a failure of civilization ? paradoxically in the very cradle of that civilization. In forty years, wine consumption has slumped to less than half the national average in France. 

 Nancy Mitford had ended her delightful biography of Madame de Pompadour with the ?very great dullness? that ?fell upon the Chateau of Versailles? after the death of the Marquise. That dullness might descend again if Wellness triumphs over Wine in Bordeaux, of all places.

 MAKE WRITING A JOINT PURSUIT

 Right price, right size

 Why don?t Indian publishers get teachers and senior academics to write textbooks for schools and undergraduate courses? After all, there is a vast pool of qualified and experienced teachers, and the student population is huge too. 

 Yet after more than 50 years of independence there is precious little to show: what we have are some reprints of outdated British and American texts, reference books and a pile of badly cloned texts. There are virtually no original texts in any subject. The UGC made attempts to commission authors some years ago, but like most state-sponsored projects, it fizzled out. Since then, private publishers have published what came their way.

 There are three explanations for this stagnation. First, lack of funds. Second, lack of initiative by publishers and a general tendency among serious academics to dismiss textbook-writing as infra dig. And third, ours is an oral culture that did not inculcate the written tradition. There is a further underlying cause: reading and writing are solitary pursuits and since we are gregarious by nature, we can?t get down to the discipline of writing.

 There is some truth in each of these charges. But what can be done? Since books are becoming expensive with each passing year and there is a limit to how much a student can fork out, it is imperative that core requirements are met at affordable prices. In the school sector, private publishers have shied away because they felt there was a monopoly of NCERT textbooks. These were quite well-produced and were affordable. Private publishers didn?t quite assess the school market. There never was, and will never be, a total monopoly of schools? basic requirements. There is a vast school market outside the state boards of education where the writ of the state government or the NCERT does not run. Publishers are free to exploit this ?open? segment.

 Besides, there were chinks in the NCERT operations. Their books went over the top of the average student. There was also no consistency in language and style as the books were written by ?a committee of teachers drawn from different parts of India?. But the NCERT operations were botched up primarily because of poor marketing and distribution. Because of the huge printings involved, books never reached destinations on time. The problem of distribution are endemic to state-run boards and the private publisher can take advantage of it.

 When it came to undergraduate texts, very few academics were able, or were willing to, set aside the time required for writing them. In the West, publishers are able to make huge advances and provide all the assistance to the author. Here, we are simply unable to come up with even a fraction of the budget requirements.

 So, what?s to done? Indian publishers must press for reprint rights for our markets, and if these don?t come through, buy the quantities required at highly discounted rates or special Indian prices. To an extent, this is being done but the net must be spread wider.

 Letters to Editor

 Quaking in their boots

 Sir ? Be it Roma Jhawar or Kislay Kaushal, the abductors do not seem particularly worried about the ransom. They feed their victims (sometimes curd), wait patiently for the police to get close and then ?return? the kidnapped. At least that is the story the police seem hellbent on feeding the public. All hints at money having changed hands are either scoffed at or brutally suppressed. Why? Because it will show up the bumbling police in true light? But isn?t that painfully evident already? Why should children held in captivity for days be returned only on the eve of elections if there isn?t anything to be gained from it? And why should abductors, who didn?t even bother to hide their identity, suddenly become so fearful of the police that they would try to return a rich teenager in full public glare in an area that apparently had been cordoned off? 

 Yours faithfully,

M. Chatterjee, Calcutta

 War fair

 Sir ? How many people died in Iraq? At the most a few hundreds of thousands. And Vietnam? Again, the figure would not exceed half a million. But we are here speaking about 260 million Indians and ?Rational behaviour? (Feb 4) shows that Ashok Mitra is completely insensitive to their lives. And all because the so-called Indian ?support? for President George W. Bush violates some of the dubious paradigms set up by the frustrated left wing circles of the world, even at the expense of the interests of India. 

 All countries which initially opposed the war in Iraq, including France, Russia and Germany, are now falling over each other to grab contracts in Iraq?s reconstruction. Mitra is quick to see this fact and criticize it. However, what he fails to see is that it is purely self-interest that drives global politics today. And so it should in the case of a relatively poor country like India. If we can get some of our people employed in the companies supplying Iraq?s economy, then why not? At least it will help some Indians lead a better life. 

 Mitra also fails to see the benefits India can reap from the continuing war on terror. If America continues to push for regime change in various countries all over the world, it would naturally make it the US a prime target for terrorism. This would give Indians a respite from the menace. As Indians, we should look out for ways to preserve the lives of other fellow Indians. Why shouldn?t we then support the US drive against terror? 

 Mitra?s rant against outsourcing has become repetitive, but that doesn?t alter the fallacy of his statements. Remember, India?s IT dream began with outsourcing, and although Indian companies are venturing into software development, outsourcing still employs tens of thousands of people in India. Why should they be thrown into poverty and misery because some of us hold a grouse against the West, particularly the US?

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The Americans are the most selfish people on earth. And now the Indians, the Poles and the Filipinos have joined them. Little wonder India, Poland and the Philippines proffered their support for George W. Bush in a recent survey despite there being suspicion that this US president could begin a third world war. As Ashok Mitra observes, the current generation of Indians are practical and have enough reasons to support globalization. Young Indians, thanks to outsourcing, now get a dream salary. Why should they not support Bush? And so what if Bush supports a dictator in India?s vicinity who also happens to be India?s enemy number one. Indians have no problems mortgaging their faith and culture so long as they get their dollars. 

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur 

 Sir ? Ashok Mitra finds immense pleasure in depicting Americans in a negative light. This is perhaps the price the US has to pay for being a major world power. But ask Bangladeshis, Nepalis or Sri Lankans; they too have the same ugly notion about Indians. When anti-Americans talk about the US invasions of Vietnam, Iraq and other nations,they tend to forget that many other world powers too invaded countries. Take Russia?s invasion of Afghanistan and east European countries or China?s acquisition of Tibet. Apart from its military prowess, the healing touch of the US is laudable. The world receives 40 per cent of aid from the US ? be it for fighting HIV, hunger or relief in Africa and Asia. The US also has a good track record when it comes to guaranteeing the independence of nations. After the end of World War II, the Americans not only left West Germany and Japan but helped them restore their economy, while the Russians remained in East Germany and other European states to instal puppet governments. 

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? ?Rational behaviour? was an excellent read. George W. Bush Jr has merely realized his family?s ambitions. The drive to have oil fields and mines under US control had been a process started by his father, and George Bush is carrying on with that legacy. As for Ashok Mitra?s sarcasm regarding the Indian middle class getting their bread and butter rations from the US, I beg to differ. When the Indian economy was down in the dumps, it was natural to reach out for help. And India did no differently. Does Mitra want us to go back to the good old days of khadi, when imported fabric was burnt? We are living in an age when technical support, both for military and industry, is being imported from the West, including the US. Why should Mitra insist on being unreasonable? What is wrong if the Indian prime minister congratulates the US president? Why do away with a diplomatic protocol? 

 Again, what is wrong if Indians shift their base to a more modernized and demanding country when the Indian government cannot give them either jobs or respect? Indians might be looked at as second-class citizens in some US states and departments, but that is not the end of the story. There are areas where the power equations are heavily in favour of Indians. And whoever told Mitra that the world is unipolar? What about China, which has been able to handle US pressures enterprisingly? Today China is an economic presence, and only because this country, as heavily populated as India, has been able to organize itself much better than its southern neighbour. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sumant Poddar, Calcutta

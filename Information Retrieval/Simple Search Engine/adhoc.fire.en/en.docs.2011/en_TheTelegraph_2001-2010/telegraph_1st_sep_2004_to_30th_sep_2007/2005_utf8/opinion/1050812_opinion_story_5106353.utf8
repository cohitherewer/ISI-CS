 IMAGES OF GRACE

In its detailed descriptions, precision and quality of production (the author Grace Morley is said to have personally vetted each picture so that the colour matched the original), INDIAN SCULPTURE (Roli, Rs 595) reflects the curator-scholar?s meticulousness. This is the octogenarian?s ?effort at popularization, in the good sense of making known widely, Indian sculpture of quality.? For those who might suspect the selection?s cultural onesidedness, there is a warning ? ?For those who are not of the faiths represented, it is the quality of the artist?s realization of the established image that is a sure guide to understanding and appreciation.? One wonders why it had to be spelt out. The two pictures here are of a 5th-century terracotta Shiva, and the second-third century AD ?Head of a Youth? in the Gandhara style. Like these, there are several other less frequently seen sculptures in this collection.

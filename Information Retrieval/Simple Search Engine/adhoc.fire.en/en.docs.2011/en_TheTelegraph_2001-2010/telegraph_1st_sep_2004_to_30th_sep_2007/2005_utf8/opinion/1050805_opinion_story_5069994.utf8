 Paperback Pickings

 A reality impossible to escape

 Hacks and headlines: A novel (IndiaInk and Roli, Rs 295) by Rashme Sehgal is set in the India of the late Nineties, and depicts the worlds of dirty politics and dirtier journalism. The killing of an upper-caste girl and her lower-caste lover sets off a sequence of events that exposes the media?s lack of scruples and topples the Janata Dal coalition government. This novel seldom rises above the hack writing which it condemns, and the deadpan realism never quite takes off: ?Bhuja saw Paro?s dismembered head roll to the ground, the blood spurt out of her body. It continued to gush for some time like a sacrificial offering received by the dry earth...Bhuja felt as if Paro?s open eyes were staring at her. They had always been sharp and watchful. She could not escape them.?

 The global warming scenario (Thema, Rs 80) by Satyesh C. Chakraborty is series of essays by an eminent geographer that offers an updated and interdisciplinary overview of its subject. Chakraborty?s approach combines science, economics, politics and policy-making, with sections on basic information (accessibly presented), rainforests, agriculture, biodiversity, air pollution, water security and rain harvesting, and several aspects of the Kyoto Protocol.

 The end of poverty (Penguin, ?4.50) by Jeffrey Sachs is ?about ending poverty in our time. It is not a forecast...I am only explaining what can happen. Currently more than eight million people around the world die each year because they are too poor to stay alive. Our generation can choose to end that extreme poverty by the year 2025.?

 Breaking barriers: Stories of twelve women (LeftWord, Rs 95) by Parvathi Menon collects, out of personal interviews, the life-stories of eminent Indian communists, most of whom were among the founding members of the All India Democratic Women?s Association. Brinda Karat?s introduction describes them as ?twelve extraordinary women who, in the course of their lives, challenged an exploitative status quo, and worked, independently and together, to build a movement for women?s emancipation in India. In doing so they broke many barriers.? Among the twelve women are Ahilya Rangnekar, Kanak Mukherjee, Lakshmi Sahgal, Manjari Gupta and Vimal Ranadive.

 AT HER MAJESTY?S SERVICE

Open Secrets: Indias Intelligence Unveiled

By Maloy Krishna Dhar, 

Manas, Rs 795

Spies never cease to arouse curiosity and interest. 

It took John le Carr? to puncture the James Bond myth. Real-life spies are not 

dashing and debonair. They are ordinary people. 

 Maloy Dhar is not exactly India?s George Smiley, but he rose in the intelligence hierarchy to become the Joint Director of the Intelligence Bureau. It is obvious that he had the slow burning energies of an agent runner and never quite liked sitting behind a desk, analysing intelligence gathered by others. He won his spurs in the North-east where, if his claims are to be believed, he had agents in every outfit of the Nagas and the Manipuri extremists. He was then moved to Delhi, where he flourished in counter-intelligence and covert surveillance.

 Somewhere in the course of his career, Dhar was bowled over by Indira Gandhi. He thus befriended her principal flunkey, R.K. Dhawan. He was so enamoured of Indira Gandhi that, on his own admission, he worked at her bidding rather than for the service for which he was recruited.

 But after Indira Gandhi?s death, he felt disillusioned with the Congress and quickly shifted his loyalty to the sangh parivar with which he had a natural ideological affinity, since he was a refugee from East Pakistan and for a long time in his life, he harboured a hatred for Muslims and Islam. 

 He was especially close to Uma Bharti and Govindacharya and through them, with L.K.Advani. He may have been a double agent since he claims that he had prior knowledge of the destruction of the Babri Masjid and was in charge of capturing on video camera the entire proceedings of December 6, 1992. His camera crew, he says, used the cover of a reputed English daily which remains unnamed.

 What Dhar really unveils is the bitter faction fighting within India?s intelligence community. He cites instance after instance of backbiting and the crab mentality which hampered intelligence operations. If Dhar pursued his own political agenda, so did some of his bosses. There was a perpetual undercurrent of tension between RAW and the IB. Politicians used both the agencies to further their own political and personal ends. One prime minister used the IB against her estranged daughter-in-law and her family. Another even against the head of state.

 The problem with Dhar?s book is that there is no way of cross checking the claims he makes for himself and the IB and the aspersions he casts on his colleagues, politicians, bureaucrats and sundry others. This is, as expected, a self-serving work, where a trifle more than India?s intelligence is unveiled.

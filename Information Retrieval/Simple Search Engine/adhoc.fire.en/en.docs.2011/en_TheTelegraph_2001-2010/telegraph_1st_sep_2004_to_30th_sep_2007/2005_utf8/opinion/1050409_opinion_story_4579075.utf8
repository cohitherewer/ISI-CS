 LOVE, LUST AND THE WRITER?S BUG

This Above All / Khushwant Singh

 Merry romp

 The first and loudest bang is on the book jacket. ?At last ? a brilliantly original novel from India,? says the Nobel Laureate, Sir Vidya Naipaul. The second, as ear-splitting as the first, are the opening lines by the author, Tarun J. Tejpal. ?Love is not the greatest glue between two people. Sex is.? He elaborates his theme: ?The laws of school physics will tell you it is more difficult to pull apart two bodies joined at middle than those connected any where near the top or the bottom.? And so it goes on for a full 518 pages. It is a long saga of a young couple madly in love and with a ravenous appetite for sex, enough to make a randy goat appear impotent and a nymphomaniac frigid by comparison with the hero and heroine of The Alchemy of Desire.

 Tejpal is Sir Vidya?s most favoured Indian: he was the only one invited to Sweden to witness the Nobel prize for literature being awarded to Naipaul. By lavishing praise on Tejpal?s first novel, Sir Vidya has dealt a back-hander to other Indian writers who have made their name in the world of English writing: Salman Rushdie, Amitav Ghosh, Vikram Seth, Arundhati Roy et al. Tejpal has his Indian admirers as well. He founded Tehelka; and is the pioneer of sting ? investigative ? journalism; he exposed large-scale bribery and corruption in the establishment. The establishment hit back and ruined Tehelka. Tejpal became a hero of victims and found new champions to print his weekly journal, the reborn Tehelka. 

 None of this yielded any clues to his hidden talent for writing fiction. He started as a small-time reporter in Chandigarh, moved to Delhi to join India Today, to The Outlook as its number two to Vinod Mehta; then quit that as well to launch Tehelka, The People?s Paper.

 The barebones of the story are of a Punjabi Hindu boy from Chandigarh (the narrator) falling in love with a girl named Fiza, nicknamed Fizz (father Muslim, mother Sikh), whose parents have emigrated to Jorhat, Assam. Despite their parents? disapproval, they get married by Sikh rites. Their courtship before marriage is a blissful affair starting in Chandigarh and the Shivaliks, mainly Kasauli, which continues in Delhi ? with more sex thrown in than I have ever read in any book. 

 The author is left with a large fortune by his grandmother, despite her outspoken opposition to the marriage. The couple look for an ideal place where he can write the novels fermenting inside him and she can run their home and start a family. They find a dilapidated old house in Gethia in the Kumaon hills. It is a haunted house, once owned by an American woman, Emily, who had married an Oxford-educated Syed, the eldest son of the nawab of Jagdevpur. He was regularly serviced by his retainers. Emily watched them and then took one of them as her lover. She kept a daily diary. Before she died she had them bound, put in a wooden chest and buried in a remote part of her estate. 

 The author chanced upon them. The muse, which had been with him earlier, came alive and he reconstructed Emily?s life from beginning to end. In the process, he ruined his own marriage. With some difficulty, he located Emily?s grave covered with moss and lichen. The epitaph read: ?Who can ever hold the essence of fire?/ Who can ever know the alchemy of desire??

 The Alchemy of Desire is a novel of significance. It puts Tarun Tejpal in the front-rank of Indian novelists. However, it is flawed with unnecessary detail and repetition. He is obsessed with the flora and fauna of every place he visits. He cannot realist the temptation to show off by filling whole paragraphs with their names: he is not really involved with them. It is the same with his portrayal of sexual aberrations; they go on ad nauseum without much rhyme and less reason. He could learn with some lessons from his mentor, Naipaul, who is a master of terse, lucid prose. However, despite these minor shortcomings, I am inclined to agree with Naipaul: Tejpal has turned out a masterpiece. It is a novel that must be read.

 Clash of colours

 This year?s Holi was the chilliest within living memory. I thanked the weather deities for being kind to aged people like me and saving us from the hullarbaazee which hooligans in our vicinity indulge in on this otherwise joyous festival. 

 I have never before received a gift on Holi; I always thought they were meant for Diwali, Id, Christmas or the new year. However, three days before Holi I received an artistically crafted carton containing pouches of gulaal of different hues: red, green, yellow, blue. It was from the public relations department of the government of Rajasthan. Having been a PR man myself, I can vouch for their lack of new ideas about anything. I was not wrong. Beneath the pouches of gulaal was a card from Vijayaraje Scindia, CM of Rajasthan, wishing me a joyous Holi. In my letter of thanks to her, I told her that I would smear some of the coloured powder on my grey beard and fantasize about her doing so. I also took the liberty of suggesting that a more appropriate Holi gift for a man of my age would be packets of bhang (marijuana), which is de rigueur on this festival. I await her response.

 Run into, or run on? 

 At times several words telescoped into one more effectively convey their meaning than when used separately. One example I can think of is Robert Lavher?s description of congestion on the road: ?the rush hour traffic I?d just as soon miss when caraftercarrismovinglike this.? I thought of something similar to describe the rush hour in our cities; it is bumpertobumpertobumperwithabump.?

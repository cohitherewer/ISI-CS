 Letters to Editor

 Tucked away and forgotten

 Sir ? Why does the media highlight some incidents and ignore others? Take the July 18 edition of The Telegraph. In Iraq, a series of 14 suicide attacks killed nearly 100 people and injured scores more. But appearing on page 3, the report hardly caught the attention of readers. In contrast, the four blasts in London which killed around 50 hogged the front-page for days. Is the media following the line of the US, which does not want to highlight terrorism in Iraq? The almost daily blasts in Jammu and Kashmir find little mention, as do the infiltrations by Pakistani terrorists, but a girl carrying flowers in London makes it to the front page. We are forced to read Faria Alam?s salacious account of her affair, but who cares about the scores of Indian women being raped? Does the foreign media pay heed to major happenings in India? So, why are we being forced to read about events elsewhere, relegating national news to the inside pages?

 Yours faithfully,

Ajay Kumar Mandhyan, Jamshedpur

 Tape worm

 Sir ? It doesn?t need a lot of intelligence to understand why the Mumbai police suppressed the tape of Salman Khan?s telephone conversation with Aishwarya Rai for four years (?Salman and Ash? Don?t ask police?, July 15). It?s for the same reason that so many Bollywood VIPs have come forward in defence of this megalomaniac and prime accused in a number of serious crimes. Salman?s first brush with the law was when he was arrested for hunting an animal of an endangered species. A few years later, he was in the news again for allegedly running over five people sleeping on the pavement ? and killing one of them ? while driving under the influence of alcohol. Salman is also infamous for threatening everyone who crosses him. While it?s true that drunken men brag a lot, there is usually some amount of truth in it. The fact is, everyone, like Salman, would like to be more equal than others in the eyes of the law. 

 One can predict how all this will end. After an investigation and a high-profile court case, it will be proved by a battery of lawyers of the country that Salman?s intimidation were the result of alcohol, that he is not liable and should not be punished. He will thus be set free. It is hardly likely that with so much at stake and so many people rushing to his rescue, the law will take its course. So, maybe it is better to stop all this to-do and wait for his next rendezvous with crime. 

 Yours faithfully,

Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

 Sir ? Lately, the media has been playing up spicy stories, no matter whether they hold any truth. Take the reports about Salman Khan?s connections with the underworld. What is the evidence? A four-year-old audio-tape. The media has it that the voice is that of Salman, threatening Aishwarya Rai and claiming to have relations with the underworld. But the tape is not at all clear and the voices can hardly be made out. The media, without making an effort to find out the truth, has levelled allegations against the actor. They haven?t even given him a chance to defend himself. Why cannot they wait for the courts to decide whether he is guilty? The whole affair seems to be completely fabricated by vested interests. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sneha Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? This controversy throws up many questions. Which agency or person tapped a private conversation between two celebrities? Does the tape have any legal weight since four years have passed and it has neither been investigated nor used as evidence in the Chori Chori Chupke Chupke case. It may be remembered that such taped conversations between Sunjay Dutt and Chota Shakeel could not be established as evidence in the court because of lack of clarity. Further, the privacy of the stars also needs to be honoured as such scandals show them in a bad light. 

 Yours faithfully,

R. Sekar, Angul 

 Sir ? The Salman Khan-Aishwarya Rai tape is a load of hot air. But there are a few questions that need to be asked. What was the police doing with the tape for the last four years? If, as the Mumbai police commissioner has said, the conversation was not taped by them, then its authenticity should be ascertained first. Also, anyone who hears the tape can make out that Salman, if at all it was him, was drunk. How seriously can we take the boasts of a drunk? Further, this may be a publicity stunt by Aishwarya herself who has lost her draw at the box office. Or perhaps it was a drama staged by a news daily which debuted its Mumbai edition that day with the news on its front pages.

 Yours faithfully,

Aamir Sajjad Ahmed, Calcutta

 Sir ? What is the use of digging up old skeletons? After all, the guilty are seldom punished in our country, specially if they are celebrities. This sudden unveiling of the tape is a publicity stunt. 

 Yours faithfully,

Aditi Purkayastha, Calcutta

 Sir ? Salman Khan?s tape has sparked an outcry all over the nation, especially among the saffron organizations. The BJP also raised an uproar in the Maharashtra legislature demanding a probe into the controversy. All this has affected the box office collections of Salman?s latest release, Maine Pyar Kyun Kiya. I feel the issue is being needlessly politicized since no protest should be registered until concrete evidence linking the actor to the underworld comes to light. 

 Yours faithfully,

Asif Khan, Gaya

 Sir ? I would say the conversation between Salman and Aishwarya is a personal one. Unless Aishwarya wishes to lodge a complaint, no action can be taken against Salman for his threats. 

 Yours faithfully,

Mahesh Kumar, New Delhi

 Sir ? The Mumbai police is shooting in the dark. If they do have evidence against Salman Khan, then they should arrest him immediately instead of making a public outcry. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sumant Poddar, Calcutta

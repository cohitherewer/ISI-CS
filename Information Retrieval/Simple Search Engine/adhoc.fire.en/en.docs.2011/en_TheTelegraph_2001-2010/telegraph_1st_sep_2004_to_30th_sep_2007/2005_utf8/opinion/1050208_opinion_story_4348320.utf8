 WHERE?S THE NEW BLOOD?

 Malvika Singh

 Three states are at the hustings and for the first time, pollsters are treading the ground very carefully. What is the strategy and plan of implementation to make the states benefit from the promises that have been made during the campaigns? Or, are the new dispensations going to fool the citizen yet again? When will the politician begin to care, begin to deliver, begin to think of the constituent and begin to want a civilized and functioning constituency? How long will India have to be weighed down by the self-centred politician and babu?

 There are other political scenarios doing the rounds. The NCP is looking to swallow the Congress in Maharashtra instead of melting into the Congress fold. Deve Gowda is moving towards the same in Karnataka. If this does begin to happen, where does that leave the Congress? Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Orissa and Uttar Pradesh are nowhere within reach. About Uttar Pradesh, where the party held its recent Chitrakoot Shikhar, ostensibly for the Youth Congress, most invitees were in their 50?s and 60?s. So typical, so predictable, so unnecessary.

 And, to go further, Salman Khurshid will never be able to show his paces and bring in the desperately required change if his general secretary is Satyavrat Chaturvedi. This ?partnership? can only run in parallel lines, never to converge. It is the most obvious strategy for divide and destroy. Ideally, Digvijay Singh should be the UP general secretary and both he and Khurshid may well be able to agree on a political strategy and pull it off. Why are obvious opportunities lost? Why are personal balancing acts being played out to accommodate dead political ducks? Why not shift gears and do it radically differently? Sabotage of all potential change is being operated with meticulous planning by jealous and opposing factions in the same party. If we can see it, surely the party bosses can see it too.

 Old and gnarled

 Senior Congress leaders in Delhi, who are incapable of winning an election but who shamelessly continue to preside, and whose names are as well known as are their political manipulations, are backing politicians in UP who have failed in the past and who had been singing the praises of Vajpayee and his party when they were denied a ticket last time around. They are saboteurs of the worst kind who are today sabotaging the Congress under Khurshid.

 Stories abound about them and their godfathers in Delhi that are quite sordid. Such political backbiting within the party can only damage it. It is sad that these ?gentlemen? in Delhi are destroying the possibility of a true change, which could be brought about by the many young Congressmen in UP. After all it is their generation that will be the majority constituent next time around.

 It is time to put those who have been entrenched in the party, who corrupted and failed it, and who reduced its numbers to a minority over the years, to pasture once and for all. Throw the fresh incumbents into the deep end, into the hinterland, and let them get on with a new ethos of political activity. 

 It was Sonia Gandhi who brought the Congress back into the fray. That is no longer disputable. Why then are all the failed men still pulling the critical strings? Are they not ashamed of themselves? Are not the aged amongst them embarrassed to be hanging on for dear life? There is need for a great big vacuum cleaner in the Congress after which any membership drive will be fruitful. No one wants to join a party that is manipulated by old and gnarled hands. Those hands are devilishly scary, hands that even work against the one person who put them back in play, Sonia Gandhi. No new blood or anyone with dignity and a sense of ethics would want to hold those hands and sully their own.

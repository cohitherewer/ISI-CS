 What could be real estate in 

 the north is locked in labour dispute 

 The happening south versus the decrepit 

 north ? a week before the Calcutta municipal polls, the rift 

 has never been wider. Debashis Bhattacharyya reports

 GREAT DIVIDE: The flyover at Gariahat (left); the Shyambazar five-point crossing

 The divide is possibly as old as the city itself. Even as an adolescent growing up in pre-Independence Calcutta, Kamal Basu distinctly remembers the cultural fault line that had then separated the citys northern head from its southern torso. If anything, the traditional north always thumbed its nose at the upstart south. After all, the north was where the city had originated. 

 It was native Calcutta and always seen as such. People visiting from the south would say they were going to Calcutta, the 86-year-old former mayor of Calcutta, a die-hard north Calcuttan, says. 

 But that was then, in the 1930s. Gallons of water have since flowed down the Hooghly, the river the city is located on. With a population of over 4.5 million people, Calcutta, the teeming capital of West Bengal, has ballooned into a megalopolis. With wider roads, flyovers, parks, shopping malls, multiplexes and hotels, the city is, in fact, racing against time to catch up with other metros in the country.

 But beneath it all, the north-south divide ? essentially a rift between old and new Calcutta ? remains. If anything, its more pronounced today as an issue in the Calcutta municipal corporations elections, barely a week away. 

 Both the Congress and CPI(M) charge that the Trinamul-led municipal board has neglected the northern part of the city over the last five years. And when they say north, they mean central Calcutta as well.

 South Calcutta was high on their development agenda as both Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee and mayor Subrata Mukherjee are from south Calcutta, says Pradip Ghosh, Congress councillor from the north, who was a member of the mayor-in-council, the highest decision-making body of the corporation. Ghosh says he was expelled in February last year from the Trinamul Congress after he raised these uncomfortable questions.

 From College Street to Shyambazar and from Kashipur to Bagbazar, the roads in north Calcutta remain narrow, potholed and poorly lit. The drinking water shortage persists in north Calcutta, with most of the new pumping stations coming up in the south. The ancient sewage system the north is cursed with, is crumbling. Parks present a picture of neglect. Very few visible projects ? flyovers, footbridges or market complexes ? have been set up in the north.

 History of neglect

 Nirmal Mukherjee, the CPI(M) councillor from Behala, who was leader of the Opposition at the corporation, agrees. There is no doubt that north Calcutta was neglected by the Trinamul board. Most big projects were carried out in south Calcutta as the party is concentrated mostly in the south, he says. 

 The apathy towards north Calcutta, Mukherjee says, heightened after the Trinamul lost both the Calcutta north-east and north-west seats to the CPI(M) in the last Lok Sabha elections. After Banerjee won from the Calcutta south constituency, the only Lok Sabha seat the party managed to retain in 2004, Mukherjee says the corporation focussed solely on south Calcutta.

 Not surprisingly, both the Congress and CPI(M) are promising to develop all of Calcutta ? and not any particular region if voted to power. 

 We will carry out development in all 141 wards under the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. We dont think, unlike others, in terms of north or south Calcutta, Rabin Deb, the CPI(M)s Calcutta district committee member and chief whip in the Assembly, says.

 Pradip Bhattacharya, working president of the Pradesh Congress Committee, says the partys manifesto has already made it clear that if the party wins it will pay equal attention to both north and south Calcutta. 

 Clearly, the Trinamul Congress is on the defensive, while mayor Subrata Mukherjee, generally hailed for improving the civic amenities in the city and reforming the moribund corporation, rues that his good work in the north has never been noticed.

 The mayor ? who has quit Trinamul with his followers after Banerjee rejected outright his call for a grand alliance with the Congress and other anti-CPI(M) parties ? says he has spent the same amount if not more on north Calcutta. 

 What can I do if people talk only of my work in the south; such as renovation of the Deshapriya Park or the building of Kalighat pumping station. Its so unfortunate that no one even mentions that I have developed a number of parks and built pumping stations in the north as well, he says. 

 Councillors from north ? and central ? Calcutta remain unconvinced. They point to the happening south, where glitzy shopping arcades like Forum, multiplexes like Inox and condominiums like South City have either come up or are coming up. Most of the new flyovers, schools, hotels, restaurants and modern hospitals have been built there.

 Time warp

 On the other hand, north Calcutta ? except for some fringe areas ? seems trapped in a time warp. Not much is happening there. True, things are fast changing in Salt Lake and even in Rajarhat. But then, these areas do not fall under the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. 

 Even on the cultural front, the pride of the north for a long time, the old city seems to have lost out to its newer cousin. Most theatres in the north ? with the sole exception of the Star Theatre renovated by the corporation at a cost of Rs 15 crore ? are either ailing or shut down. 

 Instead of thronging Biswarupa or Rangana, as they once did, the theatre buffs now flock to Rabindra Sadan, Sisir Mancha, Gyan Mancha or G.D. Birla Sabhagar, all in the south, to watch group theatres, born and raised in the north.

 Its sad but true, Suvendro Mullick, a scion of one of the most prominent zamindar families of north Calcutta, which built the famed Marble Palace on Muktaram Babu Street. 

 The corporations refusal to repair the roads damaged by tram tracks has hit the businesses hard in north and central Calcutta, especially the jewellers. Though the state government has withdrawn tram services from the better part of south Calcutta to widen roads and speed up traffic, trams are still plying through the north.

 The number of buyers have gone down considerably in Bowbazar and other areas as the roads are in terrible condition and there is nowhere to park your car, Ghosh, himself a jeweller, says. He says quite a few jewellery shops have already shifted to south Calcutta, where they have better business prospects. 

 The south may not be spick-and-span, but many of its neighbourhoods certainly look cleaner. Take Burrabazar, the trading hub in central Calcutta, now associated with the neglected north. Heaps of garbage lie around.

 Pradip Bhattacharya of the Congress says he could not believe it was so bad until he visited Posta, in Burrabazar, on Friday evening to campaign for party candidates. I went around with a handkerchief pressed to my nose. I was relieved when I got out of the area, he says. It was shocking, he says, considering the fact that deputy mayor Meena Devi Purohit is the local councillor. 

 The decaying north Calcutta ? where some roads look as if they have not been repaired for the last 50 years ? hurts writer Sunil Gangopadhyay, who straddles both Calcuttas having lived earlier in the north and now in the south. The entire north reeks of neglect. I dont live in the north any more. But as an old north Calcuttan, I feel sorry for it, he says. 

 Obstacle race

 But then, its not easy to develop old, congested north Calcutta, as Kamal Basu learnt to his cost in 1985 when he was elected mayor. Despite all his efforts, Basu could not get the crumbling underground drainage system between Dharmatala and Vivekananda Road, replaced. I had to give it up when I learnt that this small stretch would cost the corporation a whopping Rs 200 crore, he says. 

 One-and-a-half decades later, the same problems confronted Subrata Mukherjee when he took over as mayor. The north is old, unplanned and full of dilapidated buildings. Tell me, what could I do in Burrabazar? Mukherjee, now a Congress-supported mayoral candidate, asks. He says the only way to do anything in Burrabazar ? and in much of north and central Calcutta ? is to tear down the old structures. But that will never be possible.

 Harsh Neotia of Bengal Ambuja, the citys premier developer, says non-availability of land is one of the main constraints of developing north Calcutta. Wheres the land in the north? Even the closed units there, which could be real estate, have labour disputes, he says. 

 On the other hand, Neotia says land is not a major problem in south Calcutta, which, partly, explains why the south is developing rapidly. 

 According to developers, the centre of gravity shifted from the north to the south a long time ago. In fact, its now moving towards the east, with Salt Lake and Rajarhat emerging as new hubs.

 In any case, not every one agrees that the north is under developed or that the south is developed. Historian Barun De says vast areas of south Calcutta face different civic problems including frequent floodings. The conditions in slums on Bondel Road, Broad Street and Dilkhusa Road have only got worse, he says.

 Referring to the malls or multiplexes coming up in south Calcutta, De says the residents of north Calcutta should consider it a blessing that the consumerist culture has not yet swamped their lives. 

 On the anvil

 Sociologist Anjan Ghosh of the Centre for Studies in Social Sciences seems to think the same way. You need to define development. You cant define it only in terms of a consumerist culture, he says, refusing to acknowledge that the north has slipped from the development map. 

 As for the divide between the two regions, neither De nor Ghosh is sure how real it is. Nor are they sure of the issues appeal to common voters as there is no difference between north and south Calcutta for the working class, De says. 

 But with the crucial election to the countrys oldest corporation drawing near, politicians are in no mood to listen. For them, the stakes are very high. For, the result of the corporation election could show the way the Assembly election, scheduled for next year, might go.

 Subrata Mukherjee says the north will always be important in his scheme of things. I cant ignore the north. To me, its as important as the south, he says. Pradip Ghosh, the councillor who was the first to rake up the issue, feels if the upcoming municipal board does justice to the north, the dividing line will finally be blurred ? if not erased. 

 Not everyone is so sure. After all, it ? the north-south divide ? is all in the mind, some would say.

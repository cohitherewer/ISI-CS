 SONG OF THE NEW ROAD

 A ceremonial remembrance should, ideally, also be a reawakening. When the anniversary is of a book or a film or a painting, the celebration demands a renewed effort at understanding its resonance in its own time and beyond that. Fifty years after the release of Satyajit Ray?s film, Pather Panchali, the responses it evokes and the questions that can be brought to it cannot be the same as the ones in 1955. Yet the viewer in 2005 cannot be free of the associations the film has acquired, and the intangible ways in which it has seeped into ways of cultural perception in the intervening years. The anniversary itself is public acknowledgment of the film?s position in Bengal?s ? and India?s ? cultural history. The fact that Pather Panchali was an event in world cinema is not part of a separate history, but a significant dimension of this one.

 When Apu abruptly opens one bright eye in the first shot, a new world is waiting. It is a new world that Ray is exploring, in which the art, theories and techniques of the West are as available as the richest treasures of literature at home. It is a moment of confluence, forged by India?s particular history of the past years, and articulated by an artist nourished by the numerous, apparently disparate, traditions that had begun silently seeping into the country?s cultural life. A film about hunger, survival, loss and dispersal celebrates simultaneously the purity of joy and the excitement of childish discovery. But Pather Panchali did not happen in a vacuum. While Ray has been called the last figure of the Bengal Renaissance, as well as one of the first figures of modern Bengal, he is very much a man of his time. The modern Bengali, and Indian, cinema was being born around him; he made it global.

 A work of art that cannot be forgotten is difficult to contain within terms of its ?influence? ? Ray and the ?art film? movement, for instance ? or in terms of its philosophy. For example, Pauline Kael, one of Ray?s favourite Western critics, had said in 1965, ?Like Renoir and DeSica, Ray sees that life itself is good no matter how bad it is.? Ray?s ?humanism? is seen to have a Western as well as an Eastern heritage. But looking at the film now, as newer eyes would today, how relevant are these labels and histories? It is ultimately the materiality of the work of art ? the grain of the pictures, the pace of the narrative, the silences, sounds and the music, the ?luminous observation? that generates the images ? that recreates its own meaning and provokes new questions. Apu begins life by making a journey, first without his own volition, and then, through the later films, voluntarily, just as, almost without knowing it, India?s ? and Bengal?s ? doors had opened on to a wider world, and the film travelled into it. It is a story of the world growing closer while suffering continues unabated, a story that has acquired new meaning today.

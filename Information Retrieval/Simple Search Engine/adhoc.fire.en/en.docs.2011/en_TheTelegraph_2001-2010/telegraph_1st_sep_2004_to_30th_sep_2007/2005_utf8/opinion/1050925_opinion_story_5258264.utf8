 Letters to Editor

 Not a captain?s knock

 Sir ? One realizes that The Telegraph has decided to back Sourav Ganguly at all costs, but vicious quasi-racist rants like that of Raju Mukherji against Greg Chappell can only be counterproductive (?Spoiling the party, Sept 21). Chappell was a greater player and captain than Ganguly, for all The Telegraph?s support, can ever hope to be. And it makes a lot of people look ridiculous when, with every failure and politically-loaded outburst of our manipulative prince, his crown is found to be not just slipping, but rolling in the dust.

 Yours faithfully,

 Biswapriya Purkayastha, Shillong 

 Lessons of life

 Sir ? A. Narasing Lal of Lalgonda, who ?blames his government-run school for his inability to find a job and has asked the state for damages? needs to be treated as a role model by his countrymen (?Jobless? Blame it on school?, Sept 19). The government too needs to take cognizance of Lal?s complaint and work towards the improvement of government-run and government-aided schools. The Andhra Pradesh government should provide a decent job for the 30-year-old man, before investigating the truth behind his complaints. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad

 Sir ? The indictment of one?s school is shocking. It seems that A. Narasing Lal is ignorant of the fact that many men of humble origins have grown up to do very well in their professional lives, even better than their counterparts from elite city schools. Yet Lal?s allegation is a serious one. The problem is not with the differential quality of education in rural and urban India, but with the objectives of the teaching members of the system. That there is no short-cut to success, that people with humble beginnings can make a mark in life if they believe in themselves are things that should be taught. But in an overwhelming majority of schools, these values are not instilled in students. And this is nothing short of a tragedy.

 Yours faithfully,

Subhanjan Sengupta, Durgapur

 Killer wheels

 Sir ? The reports, ?Racing bus tips over bridge? as well as ?Race over in five seconds? (Sept 17) may have a lot of cinematic value but they make for very distressing reading. Imagine the horrific spectacle of a crowded bus shooting off a bridge to crash on the railway tracks underneath, just across a river, and you will have sleepless nights for a long time. But what makes the accident unique is perhaps the fact that it happened on the roads of suburban Calcutta, where vehicles can hardly move faster than 10 km per hour. Those who use our public transport every day should demand insurance with their tickets. 

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir ? Why hasn?t anyone filed a PIL against the transport ministry and the private transport operators for the number of accidents on our roads? Both should be made to pay compensation to passengers of the buses involved in accidents. And to think that the transport minister still panders to the transport lobby?s demands for fare hike with every rise in fuel price! 

 Yours faithfully,

S.S. Almal, Calcutta

 Sir ? The Bally Halt mishap happened because two greedy drivers were racing each other at breakneck speed to earn a few bucks more. How are these drivers any less culpable than cold-blooded murderers? Stronger deterrents must be put in place. Erring traffic policemen should be punished as severely as the drivers. It is because people have had enough of police incompetence that they sometimes take law into their own hands. 

 Yours faithfully,

G.D. Dujari, Calcutta

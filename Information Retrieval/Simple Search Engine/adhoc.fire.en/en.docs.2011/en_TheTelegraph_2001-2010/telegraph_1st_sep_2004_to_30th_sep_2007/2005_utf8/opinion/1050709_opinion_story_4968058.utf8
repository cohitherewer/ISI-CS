 LIVE LIFE KING SIZE

 He is just another celebrity with a nose for the white powder. But Fardeen Khan seems to be the only one who draws flak each time there is a rumpus over cocaine

 Forgive the tautology, but its d?j? vu once again. Was it just four summers ago that Fardeen Khan was in the news ? caught in the act of buying cocaine from a gentleman who subsequently sang like a canary? 

 Anybody would think this a re-run. Just last week, the police caught a high-flying executive and charged him with dealing in cocaine. The clientele list that the man ? seemingly another would-be crooner ? revealed to the police included the young actor. And Khan, once again, hit the headlines. 

 But, then, boys will be brats. They will drive fast cars, dance through the night, change girlfriends like socks ? and sniff cocaine when they can. And why not, theyd argue, when all of Mumbai ? cinema directors, media barons and admen ? is said to be doing it, too? 

 But poor Fardeen ? son of old, old Bollywood actor Feroze Khan ? is the only one getting the flak. On May 5, 2001, he was nabbed while allegedly trying to purchase one gram of cocaine. Khan said all the right things when he was subsequently released on bail. Im old enough to know what Im doing. It is not that I do things without thinking, he was quoted as saying. I broke the law, I got caught, I paid the price for it but now Ive got to move on. 

 If Vishal Meghnani, former chief executive of Provogue, is to be believed, Khan hasnt quite moved on. Meghnani is said to have given a list of cocaine users to the police ? and in the long inventory, apart from the actor who made his debut in 1998 with an eminently forgettable film called Prem Aggan, are director Ken Ghosh, an adman called Kuki Gulati and a media baron that the media seem rather shy of naming. 

 Khan, who was in London when the Meghnani scandal broke, was suitably wide-eyed when reporters accosted him after his return to Mumbai earlier this week. I am innocent. I am nowhere involved. If necessary, I can prove it in court, Khan, a brand ambassador for Provogue, said. 

 There will be quite a few people in Mumbai who may be fervently hoping that he wouldnt have to. For, going by a rough assessment, he is just one of the citys 10,000 cocaine users. Yusuf Merchant, who runs a drug rehabilitation centre near Mumbai, believes that easy access to drugs is one reason the number of users is on the rise. 

 Merchant knows what he is talking about. Meghnani, for instance, was arrested after Allwyn Sequeira, another employee of the apparel major who also runs a lounge bar, got caught while trying to send a consignment of cocaine to Chennai at the Santa Cruz airport on January 26 this year. Sequeira later told the police that he had been asked by Meghnani to send the packet to Chennai because a few of his friends in the southern city were in urgent need of the white powder. 

 The Santa Cruz episode indicates how easily cocaine passes hands even though no definite data are available on drug usage in Mumbai. Between 1992 and 1995, Mumbai police had a full-fledged anti-narcotics cell which regularly seized heroine and mandrax tablets. Today, the cell is virtually defunct. 

 But that cocaine is readily available is something that anybody living in the city can vouch for. In the lanes of Colaba in south Mumbai on most nights, foreigners are seen selling anything from cocaine and Ecstasy to heroin. The citys night life, says a Mumbai watcher, is lively ? with everything from prostitution to rave parties forming a part of it. And snorting cocaine is almost de rigueur in some charmed circles. 

 Khan, who likes the trappings of high life like everybody else, was surprisingly candid about his fondness for cocaine after his 2001 arrest. He reportedly told his friends that he used coke to cope with the tensions of his fledgling film career. 

 Stress, Merchant underlines, is one of the main reasons people take to drugs. Mainstream youth culture is defined by people who achieve stardom between the ages of 16 and 20, he said in an earlier interview carried by a website. As soon as they succeed, these youngsters have to start dealing with the stress and the complexity of being a professional who has to deliver if he is to survive in a very competitive industry. Inevitably, the stress and the pressure to deliver drive these teenagers to drugs. 

 Khan, at 31, is overage by Merchants estimation, but is otherwise a prototype of the coke-snorting yuppie. He is goodlooking and fairly successful, with his two yet-to-be-released films, Ek Khiladi Ek Haseena and Shaadi No. 1, already being talked about. He has an affluent background and likes a jet-setting life. But that, contend some of Khans friends, doesnt mean hes a bad chap. Shaheed Aamir, Khans dress designer, stresses that hes a nice person to work with, and someone you can count on. It helps that hes also great to dress.

 A fan club tells all those who are interested that his three dogs are called Samson, Puggy and Pedro. A graduate in business management from the University of Massachusetts, he has also been moving from one relationship to another. He is currently said to be engaged to Natasha Madhvani, actress Mumtazs daughter. 

 Easy come, easy go ? some would say. Quite like the 2001 episode which created nearly as much of a furore as the 2005 sequel. Then, the alleged cocaine dealer, Naseer Abdul Karim Shaikh, had also spilled the names of alleged coke users. The police spoke about crackdowns. Four years on, the case seems to have faded away ? just like powder in the air.

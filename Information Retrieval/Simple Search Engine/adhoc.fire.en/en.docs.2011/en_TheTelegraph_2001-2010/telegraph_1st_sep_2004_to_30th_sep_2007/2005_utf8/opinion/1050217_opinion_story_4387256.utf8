 LET OFF FOR NOW

 It may be too little, but it is perhaps still not too late. The Kyoto Protocol on global warming came into effect yesterday ? almost eight years after it was negotiated. It has been ratified by 140 nations, 35 of which are fully industrialized. Notoriously, the world?s largest emitter of greenhouse gases has refused to ratify. The United States of America will have nothing to do with it because it believes that the treaty would harm its economy, besides being flawed in not yet imposing similar restrictions on hugely polluting developing nations like India and China. Australia has followed suit, although it is already on track to cut emissions by 30 per cent. Britain, surprisingly, has not followed the US on this matter, and has also set its cut-down target higher than the Kyoto limit. At Davos, last year, Mr Tony Blair even tried to persuade the US to change its mind. The last to ratify was Russia, with its own emissions second only to those of the US. Russia would, of course, make a great deal of money through ?emissions trading? if it adhered to the treaty. 

 India has been let off this time. But there is a great risk that this might help India take for granted its exemption from any sort of environmental responsibility just because it happens to be a developing nation. There is no reason to rest assured with the fact that pollution is an unavoidable fallout of development for a poor country. Dodging responsibility in a global forum cannot be kept up by India forever, and there is no reason to assume that it will be eternally allowed to ignore the principles that inform the Kyoto Protocol. The government seems to feel that India should not be held to such international accountability before 2050. Meanwhile, if India remains blissfully ignorant of, or indifferent to, the mindset behind the protocol, hiding behind its status as a developing nation, then the perils ? even from a purely selfish point of view ? are too dire. The deadly pollution slowly killing Calcutta, and the political apathy that lets this happen, could both do with something like the Kyoto Protocol, sooner rather than later.

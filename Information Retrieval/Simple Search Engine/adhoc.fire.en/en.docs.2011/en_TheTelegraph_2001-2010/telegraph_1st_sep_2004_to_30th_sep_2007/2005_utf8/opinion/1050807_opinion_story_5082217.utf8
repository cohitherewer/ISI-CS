 DIARY

 As anyone surfing channels on Thursday will have noted, there?s a lot of monkey business going on in Parliament House these days. And Mamata Banerjee?s throwing papers at the speaker?s chair is not all. She was only following a long and glorious tradition of MPs who believe that if you don?t like something, there?s no reason you?ve got to take it sitting down ? you can drown it out in loud protests, you can storm into the well and stage an impromptu dharna, and if that doesn?t work, you can walk out. It?s all very engaging, this monkey business, but parliamentarians were a little taken aback the other day to see a rather well-fed langur watching house proceedings. The langur, of course, was no stranger to our MPs. As reported earlier in these columns, all the big sarkari buildings in Lutyens Delhi have a resident langur to keep away the monkeys who throng them. There?s one in the Central legislature too, who can often be seen doing his rounds, keeping a beady eye out for furry intruders. But this time, obviously, he was so diverted by the antics of our MPs that he simply stood and watched. Perhaps he was amazed to see a room full of kindred spirits. 

 The days when women were neither seen nor heard are long past, but there?s still something about women in parliament that brings out the worst in male politicians. Remember Sharad Yadav?s dismissive comments about par kattis? The RJD?s Raghuvansh Prasad was at his chauvinistic worst when he told the media that Mamata Banerjee?s in-house behaviour justified his party?s opposition to the women?s reservation bill. Allow more women inside, and see the dignity of parliament ruined, he seemed to be saying. But men aren?t too mindful of parliamentary dignity either. Remember Prasad?s own partymen snatching a copy of the women?s bill from the minister?s hands? But then prejudices are always about double standards.

 Whoever said that Manmohan Singh doesn?t know how to play the game of politics? He?s found a simple and highly effective way to checkmate the opposition from asking inconvenient questions in the house, and thereby showing up the government in a negative light in the next day?s headlines. Singh?s office ensures that he replies to the questions the same day, and the media highlights his statements. There are times, of course, when it doesn?t work. For example, when a private TV channel carried live footage of Sushma Swaraj?s intervention in the debate on the Indo-US deal. The sangh parties are making a big deal of the simplicity with which Swaraj made the complications of nuclear strategy clear to Hindi-speakers. That?s the approach they like, and one must say, it makes a refreshing change from Jaswant Singh?s hemming and hawing. As for Singh, one Swaraj should not be difficult to handle.

 Remember the analogy of the rats and the sinking ship? Something of the like is happening in the ranks of the NDA with N Chandrababu Naidu taking the lead to bring members opposed to the Congress under a separate umbrella. Obviously, the BJP hasn?t been invited. The parties ready to tango are ? the AGP, the Akali Dal, the National Conference, the Bodoland Assam, and tentatively, Samajwadi Party and the DMK. Now, finally, the UPA will perhaps have a real opposition to contend with.

 Meanwhile, the BJP?s stuck with Ram. No it isn?t the Ram temple in Ayodhya but the Ramlila grounds in Delhi that the saffronites have picked on this time. And leading the attack against the Delhi Municipal Corporation?s bid to turn it into a state-of-the-art parking lot and shift the annual Ramlila elsewhere is Madanlal Khurana. Out of work and with time on his hands, he is ripe for some mischief. If politics is the last resort of scoundrels, Ram has become the last resort of saffronites. 

 Ajit Jogi, like the proverbial cat, has nine lives. His detractors thought they had seen the last of him after his son?s arrest, but he?s neatly turned the tables on them. All the opening Jogi needed was a slightly indiscreet speech by his b?te noire, SC Shukla, criticizing Jawaharlal Nehru?s preference for English, Western culture and so on. Ever since, 10 Janpath?s been flooded with cuttings, audio and video clips of the speech. Survivor?s trick no. 101: play on the insecurities of others if you want to be left alone. 

 Mangoes and kebab, the combination is quite intriguing. And it worked to loosen tongues at a recent do at Salman Khurshid?s. All the invitees, mainly journalists and Congressmen, were in the mood for some levity. It started with a cheeky reporter asking the UPCC chief, ?Sir, aam to yahan hai, aadmi kahan hai??, referring to the Congress?s election slogan, ?Congress ka haath, aam admi ke saath.? The discussion next turned to the many varieties of the fruit and their relative merits. ?Chausa? was the very best of mangoes, Khurshid opined, leading a loyal Janpath-wallah to say that Rahul Gandhi was like the Chausa. This let loose wild, and often uncharitable, speculation about which variety of mango was like which leader. An influential women AICC office-bearer was, everyone agreed, like tota-puri, which looks attractive on the outside but does not taste too good. Well, party games can only be of one kind.

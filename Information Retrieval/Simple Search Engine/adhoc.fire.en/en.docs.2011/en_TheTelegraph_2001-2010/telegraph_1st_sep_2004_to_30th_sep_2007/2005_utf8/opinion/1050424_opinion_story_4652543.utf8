 THEIRS IS THE STRUGGLE

 Old soldiers, according to the lore, never die, they only fade away. But nobody quite knows what happens to Indian politicians when they grow old and weary. Retirement is not a word in Indian politics. Very recently, Mr Jyoti Basu, age ninety plus, and Mr Harkishen Singh Surjeet, age nearing ninety, requested the Communist Party of India (Marxist) to relieve them of their responsibilities in the politburo, the highest decision-making body of the party. Their requests were turned down. So the two old men, veterans of many struggles and obviously tired, continue in the politburo. In another party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, two other old men, well past their biblical quota of three score and ten years, are not quite decided about quitting their responsibilities. Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee hedged the question by saying that since he held no posts, he could not quit from anything. And Mr L.K. Advani did not even respond to the suggestion that both he and Mr Vajpayee should may way for a younger generation of leaders. Mr Vajpayee, as is his wont, was deliberately equivocating. He may not be holding any official post in the BJP but the moot question is whether he is prepared to retire from politics because of his age. He should know that his very presence in the party would inhibit the functioning of younger people.

 Perhaps it is a bit unfair to describe this phenomenon of politicians refusing to retire as only an Indian problem. Like many other problems in Indian politics, it might be derived from British practices. The redoubtable Winston Churchill continued as prime minister, during his second term in the early Fifties, even when he had been disabled by a stroke. The affairs of state were carried out by Anthony Eden but Churchill continued in 10 Downing Street. Lloyd George, who was prime minister of Britain during World War I, continued to be a figure in British political life at the outbreak of World War II and in fact lobbied for a berth in the war cabinet. Similarly, Harold Macmillan continued in the House of Lords for many years after he lost the prime ministership. This tendency to cling on may be related to the politicians? intoxication with power. Or it could be related to the conventional wisdom of equating age with wisdom.

 This is not the case in many other spheres of life. Sportsmen, for example, begin young and tend to burn out very fast. Old actors begin to do character roles and just withdraw from the limelight. Thus, if Sourav Ganguly announces his retirement now most people will ask, why is he retiring? But very few ask, why is Mr Vajpayee not retiring? One possible explanation has been suggested by Mr Surjeet. He said he did not intend to retire from the struggle. Most politicians see themselves as fighters for a cause. They are thus akin to soldiers. They wait till they fade away with time.

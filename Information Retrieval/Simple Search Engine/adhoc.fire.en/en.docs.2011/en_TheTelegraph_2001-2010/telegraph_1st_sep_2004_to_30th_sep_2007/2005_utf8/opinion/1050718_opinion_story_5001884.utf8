 NEW TUNE

 Domestic disagreements are messy affairs, uncomfortable to deal with. But there is a law against dowry, and the torture of a married woman for the extortion of dowry is a distinct and serious offence. Ms Sneha Dokania?s complaint against her husband and his family was of torture for dowry. According to the charge, she had been married with a large dowry to Mr Suraj Dokania, a dance teacher, in 2001. Her in-laws were pressuring her for an additional Rs 10 lakh, when, unable to bear the ill-treatment, she returned to her natal home. So far the charge is clear. It certainly unnerved Mr Dokania enough to ask for anticipatory bail. What emerged during the hearing, however, was that the alleged torture had also to do with Ms Dokania?s objections to her husband?s conduct with the students in his dancing school. 

 Conjugal disputes, especially those in which the in camera violence is not tragically evident, seldom resolve themselves into open-and-shut cases. They often exemplify, as does this one, the difficulty of separating the private from the public. The court may decide on the alleged torture for dowry extortion, but it is not its duty to lay down the law regarding spouses? conduct with members of the opposite sex. The Calcutta high court has decided in the Dokania case that the husband would have to take his wife to his workplace for 15 days and teach his students in front of her. She would tell the court after that whether she wishes to pursue her case. This is an unusual decision, and it must be seen in the larger context of the worldwide judicial trend towards negotiation and settlement. Recently, the high court has successfully brought together a few warring couples through unusual decisions. The high court in the role of domestic peacemaker is fairly novel, and there may be varying opinions about it. Taking a spouse to the workplace cannot be particularly healthy for either the dignity or the professional identity of the partner under scrutiny. Perhaps this is an angle that could also be considered. While cruelty, torture, violence must be strictly punished, the clash of perceptions between spouses cannot be a matter for judicial intervention. Ensuring security for one may lead to destroying the security of the other. The prescribed method of mutual understanding should not become a kind of informal punishment for one or both.

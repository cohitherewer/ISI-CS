 Letters to Editor

 Indians last

 Sir? With Sachin Tendulkar reaching yet another milestone in his career, politicians in Maharashtra have started rooting for the ?son of their soil?(?Scores to settle over 10,000, Mar 18). But one wonders whether the Tendulkars, Dravids and Gangulys are the assets of their home states only? Are they not, first and foremost, Indians who have made their country proud on the international stage? It is this parochial attitude which makes Indians fight over the country?s riches rather than share them with one another.

 Yours faithfully,

Ambar Biswas, Calcutta

 More sleaze please

 Sir ? Shakti Kapoor will find it very difficult to extricate himself from the mess that the India TV expos? has landed him in (?Casting couch divide runs deep?, March 15). But what is more intriguing is the reaction of members of the film industry. Instead of condemning the incident unequivocally, they are trying to protect their own skin. The common man is well aware of the murky goings-on in the world of entertainment and is unlikely to make much of these claims of innocence. But Kapoor?s antics should open the eyes of starlets who may not know what it takes to succeed in Bollywood.

 Yours faithfully,

P.K. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? There are many loose ends in the India TV story. That the casting couch exists in Bollywood is old hat. So what does India TV stand to gain by its sting operation? If the channel hopes to improve its TRPs by ?breaking? old news, it is unlikely to succeed. It seems that the India TV bosses are unaware that the audience has had enough of both ? unscrupulous movie stars and sting operations by the media.

 Yours faithfully,

Rashmi Jaiswal, Howrah

 Sir ? The footage of Shakti Kapoor asking for sexual favours from a woman journalist is shocking. But the manner in which Pehlaj Nihlani, the president of The Association of Motion Picture and Television Programme Producers, chose to make light of the matter is equally reprehensible. Nihlani?s argument that the unsuspecting Kapoor had been framed by the media does not stand up to scrutiny. Or does Nihlani have an axe to grind? Is he out to discredit all sting operations which have exposed the seamy side of some of India?s rich and famous?

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir ? It seems that our filmstars are steeped in sleaze. After Madhur Bhandarkar, it is now Shakti Kapoor?s turn to fish in troubled waters. Bhandarkar may have got away unscathed, but Kapoor will find it more difficult to prove his innocence as his misdeeds have been recorded on camera. But what prompted Kapoor to do something like this? In his films, the actor was seen doing terrible things to helpless damsels. Was he, by any chance, trying to enact this role in real life? Or does he think that his lewd act will revive his flagging film career? Doesn?t Kapoor know that our directors sign actors for their acting skills and not for making headlines for all the wrong reasons? 

Yours faithfully, 

Sharmi Adhikary, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Shakti Kapoor?s protestations of innocence should be taken with a pinch of salt. If he did receive unsolicited phone calls from the aspiring actress, Kapoor should have reported the matter to the police, instead of deciding to accept the invitation. More important, he had no business pointing fingers at Preity Zinta, especially when he has no proof to support his allegations. 

 Yours faithfully

Siddhartha Raj Guha, Jabalpur

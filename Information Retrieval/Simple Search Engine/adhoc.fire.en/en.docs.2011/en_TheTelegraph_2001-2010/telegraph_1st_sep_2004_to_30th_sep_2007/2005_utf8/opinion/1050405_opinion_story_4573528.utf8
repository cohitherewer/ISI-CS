 WHEN MEN TURN INTO BOYS

 SHOT IN THE DARK

 A crestfallen look and a good score every ten innings or so are all Sourav Ganguly needs

 What are two gentlemen, quite obviously colleagues, most likely to discuss on their ride home in an auto-rickshaw? Professional gossip perhaps. That is exactly what my two co-passengers were sharing a day after India gifted the Bangalore test on a platter to Inzamam?s boys. The conversation was progressing along familiar lines ? please excuse me if I sound like a professional eavesdropper ? till one of them casually mentioned that Mukherjeeda had told him only a while back that Sourav was in town.

 ?Who?s Sourav?? asked the other man, looking a picture of innocence. It was too much for the knowledgeable one to take. ?Aarey gadha, Sourav Ganguly. Mukherjeeda was saying that he?s very depressed. Poor boy, everyone goes through a lean patch. Did you know his father-in-law was ill? It was on my recommendation that Mukherjeeda asked Sourav?s father-in-law to get his tests done from...?

 Between tearing apart fellow practitioners of their trade ? the two gentlemen appeared to be diagnostic technicians ? and blowing his own trumpet, this man provided a few very valuable insights. Not into the Bengali psyche, which he did, but into why Sourav Ganguly will carry on as the Indian captain for a few more years if he manages to score a 65 or an 86 every 10 innings or so. If one or two happen to come in matches where Tendulkar and Dravid fail, nothing like it.

 Right now, of course, there is no reason for worrying about our boy ? who is every bit a man when he tears off his shirt and waves it in the air at Lord?s, but just a poor, poor boy when he stares blankly around him, not realizing how cleanly the ball has fooled him and removed his bails. He is only a few runs away from reaching the 10,000 mark in one-day internationals, and even with his ones and twos, will surely touch the post before the Pakistanis are out of our sight. Who knows, he might even do it in grand style before an audience consisting of Pervez Musharraf in Delhi if luck decides to smile on the DDCA. And that, perhaps, will be reason enough for some two-wheeler manufacturer to play on the number 10,000 in a commercial featuring Sourav.

 Cricket is, truth to be told, of little consequence here. Just as real singing talent is of little consequence in the making of an ?Indian Idol?. Not that anyone is denying that Sourav Ganguly can bat. He can, and rather well, if you don?t mind the leg side. About his bowling, Ramachandra Guha has probably said the last word (?He may bat like a citizen of the world, but he bowls like a Bengali?), and in fielding, his catch in Kochi notwithstanding, he does not give many people the chance to look up to him. That leaves captaincy, where, it must be admitted, he has been able to instil some sense of aggression in the players. Even when it is not reflected in the runs and wickets, it does make the ?mama?s boys? look like men. 

 Men is what Sourav is credited with turning his players into. Which is why it is funny that he should have to become a ?boy? when he is fallen on bad times. All he needs to do now is once, just once, look truly broken-hearted, and say in a subdued, cracking voice, preferably biting his nails in between, that he has let his team down. Watch the nation rally round him then, women weeping as they have never wept while watching their favourite soap. 

 Once the support is consolidated again, Sourav can concentrate on building his ?man?-power once more.

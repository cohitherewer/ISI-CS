 GET THE MOST OUT OF THEM

 Neha Sahay

 It would be difficult for Japanese managers to humiliate Chinese workers the way they have reportedly humiliated Indian workers in Gurgaon. But Japanese factories in south China?s special economic zones are nothing if not exploitative.

 An 18-year-old strong, healthy girl landed up in this diarist?s home one morning to talk about her new job in a Japanese auto spare-parts factory. Within an hour, she was sound asleep, and remained so for the next eight hours, despite loud bells and the banging of doors. 

 Night shift in a Japanese factory is no ordinary night shift for a shop-floor worker. Reporting time is at least half-an-hour before production begins: the shop floor must be cleaned. Then there?s another half-hour of neck and shoulder exercises and etiquette: singing a greeting to everyone on the shop floor with a bow. Refusal to do so results in having to go around all the floors doing the same.

 Production is under strict supervision. No talking; if any part falls down, the offender must work through her half-hour break. During the break, workers are allowed to eat in the canteen. Newcomers are so exhausted, they simply lie down on the bench or table at which they are working.

 By morning, the workers have been bent over tables for 10 hours under bright tubelights. Their neck, shoulders, eyes are all aching. But not for them the relief of dropping everything and heading straight home. They must report to the supervisor to be told about the production goals they are supposed to achieve the next night. Also to sing a paean to the glory of production.

 Finally, the workers are free to leave. Like most employers in China, the Japanese too provide one meal and dormitory accommodation for workers. But night shift starts too late for dinner and ends too early for breakfast, so no meal is given; instead, the salary is a few yuan more.

 The slave-drivers

 Even after they sign off, there?s miles to go before the workers can sleep. They need to eat, wash their clothes, bathe. There?s a washing machine in the dormitory, but it doesn?t work. A quick bath with four or five other girls (solo is a luxury), and then it?s time to crash.

 Dormitory accommodation sounds great ? after all, it?s more than what Indian workers get. However, the bed is often good only for lying down, not sleeping. There?s too much noise: workers coming and going, doors banging, phones ringing. Then there?s too much light during the day, and too many mosquitoes. Windows must be kept open for air, for the two fans aren?t enough for the huge room. There are no weekly offs to spend in bed either: when production is in full swing, the first holiday a worker gets is after three weeks.

 Salaries in these factories are higher than in small shops. Newcomers get a daily wage of 20-25 yuan; of course it?s not paid daily, not even weekly, or at the end of the month. The Japs have a neat way of trapping workers: they pay them on the 15th of every month. Most people join work on the first; and for all but the most desperate, one month is more than enough, specially in south China, where migrant girls can find low paid jobs easily.

 But getting that one month?s salary means working free till the 15th of the next month. One solution is to play the fool in these 15 days, but if they report sick more than once, they are threatened with cuts in their last month?s salary! There?s a double trap at work here. Day-shift workers get no time to look for a new job; night-shift workers are too tired during the day to do so. 

 The proletariat under Mao was considered a privileged vanguard. Wage freezes and no right to protest yes, but also more food and clothing coupons than peasants, and an assured home. Today, village elders warn children migrating to cities: ?Never work in a Japanese factory.?

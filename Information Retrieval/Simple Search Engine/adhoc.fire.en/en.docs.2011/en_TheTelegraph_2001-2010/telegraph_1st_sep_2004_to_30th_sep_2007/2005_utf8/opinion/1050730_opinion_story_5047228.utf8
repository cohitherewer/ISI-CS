 Letters to Editor

 Digging up a lie

 Sir ? The idea that Arthur Conan Doyle murdered his friend, Fletcher Robinson, to deny him the authorship of The Hound of the Baskervilles, is preposterous (?Cheat, poison claim on Conan Doyle?, July 27). The investigators must be out of their senses to bring such an allegation, and worse, follow it up by exhuming Robinson?s body. Robinson had been Conan Doyle?s inspiration in the story, and authors are known to draw their inspiration from friends and acquaintances. Since when has this become ?plagiarism?? Conan Doyle is a good research subject, but one wishes the work was done without digging up dead bodies.

 Yours faithfully,

 A. Ray Chaudhuri, Asansol

 Loudmouth

 Sir ? The situation for women in India does not seem to have changed in years, possibly decades. During the National Democratic Alliance regime, the president?s bodyguards raped a Delhi University student in broad daylight, a Swiss diplomat was raped in a moving car and a hospital ward boy raped a nurse, gouging an eye out during the act. And now, within months of the United Progressive Alliance government taking office, we hear of a call-centre female executive being raped, a 23-year-old being abducted and raped and a pregnant slum-dweller being violated in a similar manner. 

 The police meanwhile remain mute spectators. I don?t think any effort has been made to question the police commissioner, much less suggest a revamp of the force. Yet the authorities have had the gumption to suggest how women should dress, the hours they should keep and how they should use their vocal chords in emergencies. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut K. Chatterjee, Faridabad

 Sir ? The editorial, ?Scream in time? (July 25), aptly describes how hapless are the victims of rape and other assaults in this country. The police have happily absolved themselves of the responsibility to protect the lives, honour and property of citizens by advising them to ?scream? for help. But it is doubtful if the help will come from them, especially since it is they who often help criminals get away with their crime.

 Yours faithfully,

C.V.K. Moorthy, Calcutta

 Sir ? To hide their inaction, the Delhi police have suggested that women commuters follow their tips to save themselves from rapists. It is indeed ridiculous to assume that girls do not scream at the top of their voices when their abductors pounce on them. Besides, how can the police suppose that everyone will have a mobile phone to carry and call in distress? Instead of announcing the security measures women have to take for themselves, the Delhi police would have done better to admit their inability to tackle crime in New Delhi. 

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

 Wedding gift

 Sir ? I was taken aback by the extensive media coverage given to the wedding of Dawood Ibrahim?s daughter. Should criminals like Dawood be given such huge publicity? If this is indeed the trend, I too wouldn?t mind settling down with a terrorist?s son. That seems to be the easiest way to get into the headlines.

 Yours faithfully,

Pooja Sharma, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? Dawood Ibrahim is famous (or should that be infamous?) for the 1993 Mumbai bomb blasts, links with the murder of Gulshan Kumar, and other crime rackets. In spite of his misdeeds, he gets to publicly celebrate his daughter?s wedding in great style. How come no one has even made an attempt to arrest the man at a time he would have been most vulnerable?

 Yours faithfully,

Subhankar Dey, Bangalore

 JUST AND LASTING PEACE

 Beena Sarwar

 Two stories, one from the shores of the Arabian Sea in the south of Pakistan, and the other from the fabled Kashmir Valley in the north-west of the sub-continent. A diving accident?a land mine?two lives transformed. Umair, the engineering student from Karachi in his wheelchair, and Khurram, the peace activist from Srinagar with his plastic leg, are driven by far more than the urge to overcome their respective disabilities. Both were at the seventh convention of the Pakistan-India People?s Forum for Peace and Democracy in New Delhi last weekend.

 Shallow diving in Malir, Karachi, six years ago cost Umair the use of both legs. Pulling the pieces of his life together, he wanted to do something for others ? but not just in Pakistan. He decided to undertake a peace march on his wheelchair from Wagah to Delhi, and distribute medicines and wheelchairs among the poor here. ?I wanted to take along my hand-controlled car in case I needed it. The Indian government said they would agree if Pakistan gave permission, but they didn?t,? says Umair. ?I wanted to show that I was willing to undergo such trouble to draw attention to the need for peace.?

 Last year, searching the web for an organization to use as a platform, he stumbled upon the website of the PIPFPD, now in its tenth year. He contacted the organization and became a member. The organization sponsored his visa application, but the Indian government kept his passport for six months before returning it with regret citing ?security reasons?.

 ?He should make a symbolic crossing at Wagah on his wheelchair, and then take the bus to Delhi,? commented a senior Indian foreign ministry official at Natwar Singh?s reception in Delhi for the PIPFPD delegates. That is what Umair did, on this first visit to India along with his parents and the other Pakistani delegates (a record 300), to attend the PIPFPD convention. 

 His brief meeting with the foreign minister at the reception yielded a ray of hope. Singh directed officials to arrange an appointment for Umair at the Indian Spinal Injuries Centre in Vasant Kunj, New Delhi. According to the latest reports, his visa has been extended, and he has undergone a preliminary examination at the centre. 

 They didn?t warn us

 Khurram is an activist and coordinator of the Jammu amp; Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society, an independent organization devoted to covering human-rights abuses, with a particular focus on youth, students and women. Last January, its volunteers acted as bodyguards for the Kashmiri leader, Yasin Malik, who was wandering about the crowded World Social Forum in Mumbai as though he hadn?t an enemy in the world.

 In April, Khurram was among those injured in a landmine blast at Kupwara in north Kashmir during an election monitoring round. Fellow activist, Aasiya Jeelani, 29, and the 34-year-old driver of the vehicle, Ghulam Nabi Sheikh, died in the blast. A JKCCS press release stated: ?We do not know who the perpetrators of this crime were. Whoever it was we deplore acts that lead to killing of civilians. In Gujjar-patti in a landmine explosion four persons were seriously injured, two of them were government employees on poll duty much against their wish.?

 Khurram recalls how a convoy of Indian army vehicles had passed by, and then turned back. ?They saw us again as they returned but didn?t warn us of the mine ahead,? he says, ?which they would have known about because of their mine-detecting equipment?they let us go on ahead.? Still under treatment for the head injury caused at the time, he continues to actively work with JKCCS. Khurram wants peace in the region ? not the ?peace of a graveyard, but a just and lasting peace.?

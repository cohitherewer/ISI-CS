 PROMISE OF BUDDHA

 November is a good month for the comrades. By a strange chronological coincidence, the fifth anniversary of Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s accession to the chief ministership and the 88th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution fall within a day of each other. The coincidence would have been devoid of significance but for the fact that the two events measure the change that communism has undergone in the course of eight decades. The dream embodied in the Bolshevik Revolution became a nightmare till the people of Russia woke up and consigned a totalitarian regime based on lies and violence to the dustbin of history. This, and the advent of a more globalized capitalism, left communists across the globe struggling to maintain a grip over reality. One of the quickest to react was the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in West Bengal. It began the process of ideological transformation on the historically valid assumption that the world had changed, and that as a party in government in West Bengal, it had to be more realist than communist. At the forefront of this refashioning was Mr Bhattacharjee, who in his previous incarnation had been an unalloyed Stalinist but had since become the chief minister with the promise to rejuvenate West Bengal industrially. The vision of a resurgent West Bengal predated his chief ministership but it was he who gave the vision substance and direction. In public perception, he is the gallant knight committed to rescuing West Bengal?s damsel in distress. The white charger has been replaced by white dhoti and kurta.

 The agenda that Mr Bhattacharjee set himself was not easy, and five years is too short a time for its completion. Yet the task and the last five years have been the most momentous in the history of the state. The CPI(M) and the government it leads were both nurtured on the rhetoric of anti-capitalism. Mr Bhattacharjee has successfully turned this around. The government now responds to the demands of investment. There is little or no bureaucratic harassment for potential investors. More attention is paid to the development of infrastructure. There is also an unprecedented energy palpable in the enterprise to change the face of Calcutta. The chief minister is supported in all this by the party apparatchiki who have shown a remarkable willingness to abandon old ideological shibboleths. Mr Bhattacharjee has led the process from the front and has been successful in imbuing investors with a faith to put their money in West Bengal.

 The project to transform West Bengal has only begun. Mr Bhattacharjee?s real test will be when he goes to the people a few months from now. His vision has to go beyond the economy and embrace fields like education on which the CPI(M) maintains a stranglehold. Mr Bhattacharjee, over the last five years, has unfolded the age of promise. Can the people of West Bengal now look forward to the age of delivery?

 WHAT A WAY TO BEGIN

 Neha Sahay

 Chinese New Year 2005 ? the Year of the Rooster ? began two days ago. The entire country is on the move ? or so it seems. More than 145 million people are expected to travel, most of them heading home for the Spring Festival, their biggest family reunion. This time, though, the family reunion comes as a bit of a headache for China?s ambitious under-30s. With China?s transformation from a socialist agricultural society to the most-favoured foreign investment centre, the joint family system and life-long jobs are both disappearing. At the same time, as the earlier state thrust on ?Maoist thought? fades away, old-fashioned values fill the vacuum.

 So while parents cannot stop their kids from flying to greener pastures, they still expect them to marry ?at the right age?. Earlier, marriages were approved, if not made, by the Communist Party. Today, Chinese youth find their own mates. However, as in India, parental pressure still counts. But just how much their pressure counts can be seen from the new trend seen in a big way this New Year: hired ?mates? to take back home.

 Mating season

 As early as December, men began leaving notices on websites in big metros such as Shenzen, asking for girlfriends to ?rent? for the Spring Festival. This has become a full-fledged business in at least two major cities, apart from Beijing: Chengdu, the industrially developed capital of Sichuan province in the west, and the historic Liuzhou in the south. Marriage bureaus and ?dating agencies? have set up ?lease-a-girlfriend? services. At 300 yuan (Rs 1,800) a day, girlfriends can be hired by men of marriageable age to take home for the festival.

 In Beijing, 300 yuan can only get you an under-graduate. For a post-graduate, you have to pay 800 yuan a day. But if you have no particular specification, you need pay just 150.

 One 31-year-old Beijinger has already burnt his fingers doing this. He hired a post-graduate for 500 yuan to fly home to an ailing grandmother, but reached too late. His girlfriend, however, was in no mood to mourn; so while he and his family went around arranging the funeral, she put on some music and was soon dancing.

 Significantly, no such agencies have been reported to be catering to women. But Chinese women are a special breed. A 23 year old has left a notice on a private website, offering as much as 800 yuan a day for a suitable graduate, preferably an army man, who would pose as her fianc? for a fortnight. Owner of two beauty salons, one car and one apartment, this successful manager confessed to having been unlucky in love, and hence no longer interested in it. Too busy to go home for the last two years, she didn?t want to disappoint her parents this time.

 World apart

 Meanwhile, migrant workers, who barely manage to make 800 yuan a month, among them construction labourers who haven?t been paid for months, are struggling with another new year innovation: counterfeit tickets. Ticket-manufacturing ?units? have been found, where used or short distance tickets are made over to look like new, long distance ones. Last month, police seized 3,000 such tickets in Guangzhou alone. Another method is for tricksters to get gullible would-be travellers talking, ask to see their tickets and then exchange their own fake ones for the latter?s genuine article, which are then either sold in black or returned to claim a refund.

 The lavishness of the celebrations never fails to astonish. This year, top-end hotel rooms used for family reunions are heavily booked ? 20 of the 24 karaoke rooms in the most expensive five-star hotel in Shenzen, costing between 2,800 yuan to 20,000 yuan for the Lunar New Year?s eve, were booked days earlier.

 Xinniankuai le ? Happy New Year!

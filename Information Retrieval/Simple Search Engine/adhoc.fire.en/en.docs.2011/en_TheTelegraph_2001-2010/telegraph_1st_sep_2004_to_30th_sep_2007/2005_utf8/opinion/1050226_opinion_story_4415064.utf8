 NOTORIOUSLY FAMOUS

This Above All / Khushwant Singh

 Top of the mind

 A much cherished and wide-spread belief is that names of evil-doers are forgotten as soon as they are dead whereas names of good people are remembered forever. For understandable reasons, all religions lend support to this belief to discourage evil-doing and encourage benefactors. 

 One of the earliest texts is the Old Testament; the Wisdom of Solomon waxes lyrical about how names of evil men evaporate as soon as they are gone. I quote: ?What hath pride profited us? Or what good hath our riches our vaunting brought us? All those things are passed away like a shadow, and as a post that hasteth by; and as a ship that passeth over the waves of the water, which when it is gone by, the trace thereof cannot be found, neither the pathway of the keel in the waves; or as when a bird hath flown through the air, there is no token of her way to be found, but the light air being beaten with the stroke of her winds, and passeth with the violent noise and motion of them, is passed through, and therein afterwards no sign where she went is to be found; or as like when an arrow is shot at the mark, it parteth the air, which immediately cometh together again. So. that a man cannot know where it went through; even so we in like manner as soon as we are born, begin to draw to our end, and had no sign to virtue to show, but were consumed in our own wickedness.?

 However noble the sentiments, they do not tally with facts. I recall my childhood years in my village in the desert. We had a lot of peers (population being predominantly Muslim) and Sikh sants visiting us. I can?t remember their names. The two that have stuck in my mind are Sultana and Tora, notorious dacoits who looted and killed and terrorized the entire region for many years. There was also the much loved Dulla Bhatti, a highway robber who waylaid Mughal caravans and besides looting them, rescued Hindu girls taken captive and returned them to their parents. We sang praises of Dulla at every Lohri. 

 Ask any English child the one name from history he or she knows best and the answer will be Robin Hood who ruled the New Forest with his gang of brigands. And later generations of English children know more about the serial-killer Jack the Ripper, than any of the saintly men or women of his time. It is the same in America; the name of Bill Cody has outlasted that of his good contemporaries. 

 Back home in India, whose names do you think will stick in the minds of the generations to come? Undoubtedly those of Phoolan Devi and Veerappan.

 In the sunset of life

 My musings on death and dying, and disbelief in generally accepted religious beliefs in the Day of Judgment, heaven or hell, cycle of births, deaths and rebirths, has evoked many readers to come out with their thoughts on the subject. One of them is the eminent film-producer, Som Benegal. I reproduce some of the verse:

In the evening of Life in this world,

the prospect is not of entering a night of eternal 

sleep,

But of an awakening to a new sunrise

 Of a new Sun that holds its radiance

 on an incomparable world

of realms beyond our present experience.

 Perhaps there is a material reality

 Of a dimension we know not; or,

 Perhaps an immaterial spirituality

 Of a supernatural continuum which

 we cannot even imagine.

But this much we surely must know?

 The vital force, the energy which 

 quickens life is indestructible

 and can only change from one

form to another. This is the immortality

bequeathed to us in boundless universes

 and timeless eternities.

Therefore the evening of Life as it draws

 to its close is not a time for despair or

despondency or resignation, but rather

for sublime composure, untroubled peace,

tranquil expectation above and beyond

 today?s transient travails.

 The man who knew everyone

 My friend Jamshedji Dinshawji Ardeshir (JD) is a Parsi bawa.

 Jamshedji, as usual, was bragging to his American boss. ?You know, I know everyone there is to know. Just name someone, anyone, and I know them.? Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ?OK, JD how about Tom Cruise????Sure, yes, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it,? said Jamshedji.

 So the two of them flew out to Hollywood and knocked on Tom Cruise?s door, and sure enough, Cruise shouted, ?Jamshedji Bawa, great to see you...come on in and join me for a Parsi peg or two and lunch!?

 Although impressed, Jamshedji?s boss was still skeptical. After they left Cruise?s house, he said, ?JD your knowing Cruise was just a lucky break.? ?OK, then just name anyone else,? says Jamshedji, ?President Clinton?, his boss quickly retorted. ?No problem,? JD said, ?I know him very well,? Let?s go to Washington D.C.? So, they flew to the capital. At the White House, Clinton spotted Jamshedji on a White House tour and motioned him and his boss over, saying, ?JD, what a pleasant surprise, I was on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let?s have a cup of coffee first and catch up on all the girly gossip.? The boss was very shaken by now, but still not totally convinced.

 After they left the White House grounds, he expresses his doubt to Jamshedji, who again implored him to name someone else. ?The pope,? his boss replied. ?Sure,? said Jamshedji, ?I?ve known the pope for a long time.? So off they flew to Rome. Jamshedji and his boss were assembled with the masses in the Vatican Square when Jamshedji said, ?This will never work. I can?t catch the Pope?s eye, among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards, so let me just go upstairs and I?ll come out on the balcony with the pope.? Jamshedji disappeared into the crowd. Sure enough, half an hour later Jamshedji emerged with the pope on the balcony, waving to the masses, along with the pope.

 When Jamshedji returned, he found that his boss had a heart attack. Anxiously working his way to his side, Jamshedji asked, ?What happened boss?? His boss looked up and murmured, ?I was doing just fine until you and the pope came out on the balcony, and the man next to me asked? ?Who?s that guy on the balcony with Jamshedji??

 Moral: Never ever underestimate the popularity of a Parsi bawa.

 SANIA VS HUMPY

 It has never been glamorous to be quiet. Stereotypes have to be broken with panache, and excellence has to be an arresting spectacle in order to be f?ted as such. Celebrity and image ? in a literally visual sense of the words ? are now virtually inextricable. Sania Mirza and Koneru Humpy therefore make an interesting pair. It would not be unfair to say that Humpy?s calibre as a chess-player is higher than Sania?s as a tennis-player. But Humpy is a record-breaker and Sania a star ? and the difference between the two reveals a great deal about how India creates, or looks at, its public figures. This is, of course, not purely a matter of ?image?, but also one of material gains, of how much the image of each player is worth in the market, in the world of sponsorships and endorsements. For the players themselves, this translates directly into the kind of patronage they get from the corporate world as well as the state. The immediate context for talking about these two superlatively talented young women in contrastive terms is, of course, the Andhra Pradesh chief minister?s munificence towards Sania ? a cheque for Rs 20 lakh ? when Humpy has been refused state support in her training for the world chess championships coming up early next year.

 It would not be entirely fair to the Andhra Pradesh government to say that it has been indifferent to Humpy?s career. But the difference in the quality and quantity of the state?s largesse (recall Sania?s Arjuna Award last year), reflects the judgment that has already been passed by that other arbiter of popular judgments, the media. And this has as much to do with social, cultural and cosmetic hierarchies, with class, demeanour and looks, as with the relative status of tennis and chess within the sports and entertainment markets, particularly their relative importance for television, and hence, advertising. This sort of discrimination has also been faced by athletes, as some of Anju Bobby George?s recent public statements have tried to bring to notice. The phenomenon is by no means confined only to sports. In as ?intellectual? a sphere as publishing, a good-looking and (by certain standards) glamorous writer will be flashed on the dust-jacket, and would be subjected to a pitch of unabashedly visual publicity that would appear, to some, to have very little to do with the literary merit of the product.

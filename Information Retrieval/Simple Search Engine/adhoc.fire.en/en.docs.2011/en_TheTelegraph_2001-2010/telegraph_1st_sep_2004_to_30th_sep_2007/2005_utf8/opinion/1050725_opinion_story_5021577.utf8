 Letters to Editor

 Mind your business

 Sir ? S.L. Rao makes a strong case for deregulation of public sector undertakings in ?Public versus private? (July 18). As the saying goes, ?when it?s everybody?s business, it?s nobody?s business?. Since public sector units lack the proper incentive to make profits and distribute returns to its stakeholders, it is only natural that they will turn into money-guzzling Leviathans. PSUs will only perform well when they are subjected to competitive market forces and professional management techniques. Privatization and disinvestment become absolutely necessary to infuse new life into these enterprises.

 The left may see red over the disinvestment of ?profit-making? PSUs. But this profit is itself an illusion if one takes into account the subsidies, price guarantees, preferential loans and restricted competition the government has to undertake to maintain these units. Often, the government loses more by way of interest payments for the loan taken out to finance PSU operations than the returns generated by that company. In any case, simply making a profit is not enough for a company to survive and expand. The left fails to address the concept of profit maximization. 

 The concept of ?turning around? sick PSUs again is a non-starter. This would entail pouring in more public money without chances of recovery. For PSUs, because of overt government interference and lack of specialized advise, tend not to carry out a proper corporate restructuring programme. More cash would mean more doles for idle workers. 

 Yours faithfully,

Aruni Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? Nowhere in the developed world is the government engaged in doing business and running enterprises. In India, public sector enterprises are run like a social welfare scheme for employees who get a handsome salary for not working and then a sizeable pension after retirement. In ?Public versus private?, S.L. Rao has tried to argue that disinvestment and privatization are the only way to compete in today?s market economy. As he points out, an enterprise can survive if it is ?competitive, productive and efficient?. But state-owned industries can never fulfil any one of these conditions. Which is why the left opposition to the disinvestment of Bhel leaves such a bad taste in the mouth. Contrary to its allegations that the Congress is violating the common minimum programme, it was the left which is doing the violation. The left does not realize that apart from the Navratnas, no other PSU can be deemed entirely viable. In fact, the Marxists should rest assured. Had India truly followed a capitalist policy, it would not have had an even larger number of the unemployed. 

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh,

 Sir ? Contrary to the editorial, ?Left?s nerve? (July 11), one would like to point out that it is not the left alone which is paradoxical, that is, it follows in Bengal what it attacks in New Delhi. Take the Congress. It may be a harbinger of nationalization, but in effect, it works no differently from a feudal landlord, be it in politics or in governance. Be that as it may, economic wisdom says that the nation can no longer afford to keep the white elephants the PSUs have become. The Manmohan Singh government is trying to undo the incalculable harm the effort to maintain the ?temples? of governance has done to the nation. What is strange is that the Congress should be attempting to do this in conjunction with the left, which has, through its quaint ideology, pampered a class of workers who do not work. 

 The leftists often talk about profit-making PSUs. But how much profit do the Navratnas make? Is the profit commensurate with the amount of public money invested in them? What about Steel Authority of India Limited, which is perpetually in the red? What about the behemoth Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited, whose workers do not show up for repair even after 10-12 days? And the less said about the state electricity boards the better. 

 In the Nineties, the then chief minister Jyoti Basu, when faced with resistance to his government?s plans to hand over the Great Eastern Hotel to a foreign consortium, had asked, ?Whoever has heard of a government running hotels?? Precisely. Why should the government run hotels, sell electricity and even chemicals? 

 Yours faithfully,

K. Chatterjee, Santiniketan

 Baby talk

 Sir ? If a corporate joke is regarded as promoting terrorism and patriotism turns into jingoism, then our country seems to be heading for trouble (?Osama enter motivation hall, manager lands in jail?, July 21). Sanjiv Bhatia, the maverick branch manager of a private bank in Kanpur should be applauded for bringing some fun to the boring world of banking. Instead, he has been thrown behind bars. Osama bin Laden is undoubtedly a deadly terrorist, but I don?t see how national security can be harmed if someone makes good use of him. Some crystal glasses bearing Laden?s face could not have started a jihad in India. Even fifty-eight years after independence, India does not seem to have grown up at all. 

 Yours faithfully,

Subhajit Sengupta, Calcutta

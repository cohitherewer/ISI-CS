 Anant Singh is a frequent flyer. After all, South Africa?s biggest film producer, distributor and entertainment magnate rolled into one has to travel across the globe on work. Last Tuesday, he was packing his bags for the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland ? Singh is an invitee there ? when he was told that his production, Yesterday, a searing human drama on the AIDS epidemic in South Africa, had been shortlisted for the Best Foreign Language Film award at the Oscars, 2005. His associates at Videovision Entertainment ? Singh?s mammoth showbiz enterprise headquartered in Durban ? erupted with joy. But for Singh, there was the long flight ahead to Switzerland. 

 But then, travelling is not just a metaphor for living for the 48-year-old Singh ? it?s literally in his genes. It is a story that goes back 120 years, to the time when his great-grandfather left behind home and hearth in sun-baked Rajasthan to set up base in South Africa. In time, his grandfather worked as a lawyer?s clerk and Singh grew up in a different Durban locked in the vice-grip of apartheid. ?We lived in Springfield and Reservoir Hills, middle-class suburbs reserved just for people of Indian origin. There was no social contact with other race groups,? Singh reminisces. But even as a child then, Singh was aware of the challenges and menaces facing South African society. 

 It is this enduring awareness that finds expression in Yesterday ? the first ever film to be made entirely in isi-Zulu, the most widely-spoken South African tongue. ?We had planned to do it in English, but a screen test in Zulu was so powerful that we immediately dumped the idea of an English version,? Singh says of the film, made in collaboration with The Nelson Mandela Foundation. And it is this power to move that makes the story of Yesterday, a Zulu woman played by Leleti Khumalo, so poignant. Former President Nelson Mandela describes it as a ?simple, yet powerful story?. 

 Yesterday is deserted by her miner husband after he infects her with the HIV virus, but she survives in the hope that one day she will see her daughter, Beauty, go to school. Her story could be that of any one of the five million people infected with AIDS in South Africa, a country with a population of just over 46 million. 

 Like its producer, Yesterday, too, has gone places. Released last September in South Africa, the film travelled to various festivals, picking up the inaugural Human Rights Film award at Venice. It was also shown at the 35th International Film Festival held in Goa in December. For Singh and the director Darrell Roodt ? whom Singh describes as ?long-time colleague and collaborator? ? this was the ultimate proof that cinema could communicate across all social and cultural barriers. 

 The Oscar nomination itself is like a journey in time for Singh, showing the trajectory the filmmaker has traced since he began as a producer in 1984. ?Television wasn?t there during the apartheid years and we watched a lot of 8-mm movies at home. Even then, I would be fascinated by the moving images of Charlie Chaplin on the screen,? says Singh. 

 Singh was 18 ? an age when dreams take a while to die. To buy time, he enrolled in an engineering course. And when a chance finally came to buy up the same store that he worked for as a child, Singh didn?t think twice before dropping out of university and taking the plunge. From running the store he moved on to film distribution and then finally to film production. 

 His debut, A Place Of Weeping, had Roodt as its director and was the first anti-apartheid film to be made entirely in South Africa. ?We did it on the run from the security police of the apartheid regime,? Singh remembers. 

 It was a beginning that has seen Singh take over as the leading figure of the movie industry in South Africa ? a status which allowed him to bag the coveted film rights for Nelson Mandela?s biography, Long Walk to Freedom. The film, slated for production in 2005, stars Morgan Freeman as an older Mandela, and has Shekhar Kapur as director. 

 Dealing with Kapur is not the first brush Singh has had with Bollywood. Amitabh Bachchan has been a friend for over 15 years now and when he travelled with a troupe of stars to Durban for the Now Or Never Live! performance in 2002, Singh?s company was in charge of managing the show. With such a strong connection with showbiz India, is a Bollywood venture on the cards for Singh? The producer gives a tantalising reply. He is keen, but only if the right project comes along. He has spoken to Bachchan in this regard ? and that?s all he?ll say. 

 But then, Singh has always preferred to let his work do the talking, while he strides on. And if he finally travels up the aisle on February 27 to collect the golden statuette on Hollywood?s biggest night out, Anant Singh will have come a long way indeed.

 HOW TO MINIMIZE THE RESPONSE TIME

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the government of India?s status report on Disaster Management in India, August 2004

 A web-enabled centralized data base for the India Disaster Resource Network has been operationalized. The IDRN is a nation-wide electronic inventory of essential and specialist resources for disaster response. 

 The IDRN lists out the equipments and the resources by type and by the functions it performs and it gives the contact address and telephone numbers of the controlling officers in-charge of the said resources. Entries into the inventory are made at district and state level. The network ensures quick access to resources to minimize response time in emergencies.

 The system will give, at the touch of the button, location of specific equipments/specialist resources as well as the controlling authority for that resource so that it can be mobilized for response in the shortest possible time. The data base will be available simultaneously at the district, state and national levels. 

 The states are being assisted to set up control rooms/emergency operations centres at the state and district level. Assistance under the Modernization of Police Scheme is also available for setting up EOCs. The control rooms, which will function round the clock, will be composite control rooms to look after law and order issues as well as disaster management. Equipments are also being provided for these control rooms under the disaster risk management programme. Hazard zone-wise standard layout, structural design and construction drawings have been developed for state and district EOCs and shared with all the states. Construction work has stated for multi-hazard resistant EOCs in six states and 64 districts. 

 To coordinate the entire disaster/emergency operations effectively, the existing Control Room at the national level is being upgraded as National Emergency Operations Center. The National EOC is equipped with satellite phones, GPS, computers, emergency lights, GIS information system and so on in five on-site emergency coordination kits in ready-to-use mode. Staffs in the NEOC have been trained. A state-of-the-art underground and all-hazard resistant, National EOC with superior structural features and communication facilities is being set up. 

 The communication network between the national and the state EOCs and the site of the emergency...are currently based on the DOT network. It has been observed that in a calamity..., communication is the first casualty. It has therefore been decided to put in place multi-mode and multi-channel communication systems...it has been decided that the POLNET will also be used for disaster management; and for this the POLNET communication facility will be extended to SDMs and collectors as well as the EOCs. 

 For emergency communications, discussions have also been held with the Department of Space and Research Organization. They will be making available alternate satellite communication units to connect with state EOCs and mobile units which can be transported to the site of a disaster. A group had been set up for drawing up a communication plan for disaster management. This provides for a dedicated communication system for disaster management with built in redundancies. 

 Phase I of the National Disaster Management Communication Plan to provide satellite based mobile voice/data/video communication between National EOC/state EOCs/ and remote disaster/emergency sites is under implementation and is expected to be completed by October, 2004.

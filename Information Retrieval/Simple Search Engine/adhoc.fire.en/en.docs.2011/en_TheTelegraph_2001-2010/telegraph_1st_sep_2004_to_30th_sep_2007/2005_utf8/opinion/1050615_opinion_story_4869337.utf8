 LOSING NEVERLAND

 That it should all go back to Peter Pan is disconcerting. But is there not something already quite bizarre about refusing to grow up? The Michael Jackson mythology ? together with everything that his version of Neverland has come to stand for in the last few months ? cannot let go of the idea of childhood. And for this reason it will be equally difficult for some to let go of a profound unease in spite of the court?s acquittal of Jackson. At the heart of this trial are three children and the stories they chose to tell about their interactions with Jackson. These stories, brittle with contradictions and lapses of memory, were being viciously fought over by two adults, both of whom are parents whose children are yet to reach adulthood ? and all this taken up into a labyrinth of sexual allegations that have failed to convince the jury. In the lives of both Jackson and Ms Janet Arvizo, what joins childhood and adulthood is the making of fairly substantial fortunes. Is this, then, a story of adult greed and juvenile cunning, or vice versa? And what does this say about childhood ?innocence? and parental ?love?, and about the relations of both with money and fame? In Jackson?s Neverland and in the Arvizo family, there is some sort of shadowy and direct link, respectively, between adult needs and compulsions on the one hand and juvenile sexuality, in all its vulnerability and disturbing ambivalence, on the other.

 Jackson and Ms Arvizo both understand the lucrativeness of victimhood, although they have been at opposite ends of the stick. Jackson has already lost millions in two out-of-court settlements, both being allegations of sexual abuse of children. Ms Arvizo has reportedly made $100,000 from a settlement with a department store, in which she had claimed that she was sexually assaulted and racially abused by security staff after her sons were accused of shoplifting from the store. This time, she had also hoped to cash in on the sympathy factor, since her son, the alleged child-victim, is a 13-year-old leukaemia survivor, whose family had also convinced other celebrities to organize fund-raising events for his treatment. Jackson?s name has been cleared this time. But in a country where only terrorists manage to strike more terror than paedophiles in the hearts of the righteous, his actual trial has only just begun. What is most real about Neverland is its name.

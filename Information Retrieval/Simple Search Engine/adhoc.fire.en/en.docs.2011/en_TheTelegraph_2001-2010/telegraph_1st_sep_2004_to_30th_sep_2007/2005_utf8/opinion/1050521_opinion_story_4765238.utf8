 MESSAGE IN THE SPEECH

 Issues, and not ideology, should determine policies and support to policies. This almost self-evident premise of politics often gets mired in the petty vested interests that masquerade as political practice in India. In his address to the Confederation of Indian Industry, the president of the Bharatiya Janata Party, Mr L.K. Advani, appeared to break away from this pernicious tendency and send out a radically different message to the prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh. Mr Advani affirmed his commitment to the pursuit of a double-digit economic growth. This can be interpreted in no other way save as an avowal of the policy of economic reforms which Mr Singh inaugurated in his finance-minister avatar in the early Nineties. As a prime minister in the beginning of the 21st century, Mr Singh?s enthusiasm for reforms has been somewhat hamstrung because of his party?s lack of numbers in the Lok Sabha. According to Mr Advani, the prime minister is unable to pursue his own dharma of reforms because he is so critically dependent on the left for his own survival. This dependence on the left, according to the president of the BJP, has been fatal for economic reforms and for economic growth that outstrips the pathetic figures that pass as the Hindu rate of growth.

 Mr Advani did not stop at reminding Mr Singh of his swadharma or at the expected left-baiting. He accepted, albeit tacitly, that his own party is also responsible for the tardy achievement in the field of economic reforms by the present government. The BJP has consistently opposed, in the Lok Sabha, all legislation furthering economic reforms. Some of these legislations, ironically, had been proposed by the BJP when it was in power. The BJP opposed these for no other reason but the fact that they were being put forward by a Congress-led government. The opposition was grounded not on any principle but on narrow-minded anti-Congressism. Mr Advani assured the prime minister that the BJP would abandon its confrontationist programme and would support the government on any reform essential for the country?s progress. The tacit admission and the overt promise both deserve applaud. If Mr Advani delivers on his promise, then perhaps for the first time in Indian politics, support to policies will be determined on principles and not on antiquated but highfalutin ideologies like socialism and Hindutva.

 Mr Advani?s commitment to issues, especially to economic reforms over ideology, was evident in his praise for Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, the chief minister of West Bengal. Despite his congenital anti-communism, Mr Advani could praise a communist because the latter is an advocate of economic reforms. The practice of liberalization was more important to Mr Advani than the ideological divide between Lenin and Golwalkar. The message lies in Mr Advani?s promise; in its fulfilment lies a unique change in Indian politics. History might remember Mr Advani for pioneering this transformation.

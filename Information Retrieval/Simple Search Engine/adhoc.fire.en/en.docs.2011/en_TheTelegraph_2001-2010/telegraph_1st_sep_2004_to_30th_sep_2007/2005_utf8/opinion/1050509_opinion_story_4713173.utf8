 PRIZE FOLLY

 Coincidences often have a divine glow about them. Nothing short of a witty divinity or a supernatural CEO could have managed to make the report of the comptroller and auditor-general on the Indian Museum coincide with the arrival of the Nobel Prize replica in Santiniketan in time for the poet?s birthday. Maybe the priceless Buddha head, vanished from its glass case in the museum last December, might be replaced with a fake one by the next Buddha Purnima. The solemn inefficiency and dedicated callousness of the administration leave no hope for recovery of the original. Besides, a replica has a comfortable feeling of finality about it. It spuriously frees everyone of responsibility. The CAG report elucidates the various forms of shameless apathy, taking account of the complete lack of security for priceless objects in the museum, the absence of the necessary technology of protection, the most basic of which is closed-circuit television, the lack of the trained security personnel required by recruitment rules, the blithe misuse of allotted funds accompanied by a bland cluelessness about the value of the protected objects. 

 It is amazing that the museum administration has actually installed fire detectors in 2004, after having been advised to do so by a review committee in 1992. Perhaps, the fire warning systems do work. But given the close attention museum authorities expend, inexplicably, on striking bargains such as the one with the woman who sold them her grandmother?s bracelets, the fearful might worry that other valuable pieces, less visible than the Buddha head, might have vanished too. The Asiatic Society offers the Indian Museum considerable competition in the matter of generosity to thieves and smugglers. Callousness and corruption are not the Indian Museum?s monopoly after all.

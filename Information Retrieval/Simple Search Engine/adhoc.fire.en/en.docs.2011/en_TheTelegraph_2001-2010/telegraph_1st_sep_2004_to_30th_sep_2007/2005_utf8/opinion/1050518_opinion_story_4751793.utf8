 WRITTEN OUT

 It was in another age that a king?s word made both law and history. In these democratic times, though, the people?s will reigns supreme. So the people of Manipur have given themselves back what a king had taken away from them some 270 years ago. The state government?s decision to replace the Bengali script by native Meitei at all levels of education is clearly a triumph of democracy and identity politics. The chief minister, Mr Okram Ibobi Singh, did well to read the writing on the wall. Not that it was an easy decision for his government. Meitei may be the script used by the majority community in the state, but there are other ethnic groups who had their own ideas on the issue. Besides, the changeover from Bengali to Meitei in school and college textbooks would need a major administrative initiative. However, these challenges could not detract from the overriding cultural argument in favour of Meitei. Considering the violent turn that the script movement had taken recently, an indecisive government could have made matters worse. Mr Singh should be given credit for the way he acceded to the demand for the Meitei script without alienating other sections of the people. These people, mostly tribals, would be allowed to use the Roman script. 

 The Meitei story is actually set in a larger cultural context in the North-east. If the Meitei king banished the native script under his Bengali guru?s influence, other outsiders, primarily Christian missionaries, scripted other linguistic histories in the region. Administrative compulsions of the British Empire sometimes influenced the choice of scripts. Thus, Bengali was the official language of Assam for sometime during the British rule. As local aspirations grew stronger, the languages and scripts of the outsiders became a constant source of ethnic tension. This apart, the democratic cry for the development of even the tribal languages grew louder. Language policies of state governments were increasingly seen as powerful tools for fostering ethnic harmony. The Tripura government set an example by promoting the Kokborok script for the tribals. It was a policy aimed at easing tensions between the tribals and the majority Bengali population. As Manipur celebrates the return of Meitei, it also needs to guard against the dangers of cultural insularity. The caveat may not be out of place for an ethnically diverse region.

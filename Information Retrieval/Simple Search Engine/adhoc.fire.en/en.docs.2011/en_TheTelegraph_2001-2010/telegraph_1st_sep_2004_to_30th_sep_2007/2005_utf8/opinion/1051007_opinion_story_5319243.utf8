 Letters to Editor

 Strike when hot

 Sir ? ?Strike truth strikes home? (Sept 30), depicts the true political scenario in West Bengal. The left, as usual, assured the population that the bandh on September 29 would not be forced on anyone. And yet, the cadre blocked the way of Meera Bhattacharjee in ample demonstration of how false this declaration was. The cadre relented only after they recognized the occupant of the vehicle, which, they admitted, was the ?wrong? car. The train carrying patients from Vellore and scores of other ambulances within the city ferrying the sick were probably the ?right? ones. The episode shows that the administration takes practically no steps to save common people from harassment on bandh days. The chief minister failed to hear the questions of the media the previous day. Perhaps he should seriously consider getting himself a hearing aid if he wants to have a ear to the ground.

 Yours faithfully,

Rahul Dasgupta, Kharagpur

 Sir ? Some from the chief minister?s staff were transferred for not standing up and saluting his daughter. On the day of the bandh called by his party, his wife was heckled by his own partymen. Doesn?t it call for sterner action than pious reminders to the party about the rights of citizens? 

Yours faithfully, 

Asim Kumar Bhattacharya, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The news of the chief minister?s wife being confronted by Citu members shows how steadily the environment has deteriorated in West Bengal. Goons of the ruling political party have converted the people of this state into two classes ? the ?first class? consists of ministers, members and cadre of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), their relatives and friends. The rest are all ?second class? citizens. 

 The chief minister?s wife had her right to work violated. But the Citu leader in charge of the mob apologized to her for the incident. Will there ever be such an apology for the rest of us, the ?second? class citizens whose rights are trampled, threatened and violated on a regular basis? It is risible that the former chief minister, Jyoti Basu, should now come out in support of the right of people to move freely. It was under his leadership that the bandh culture flourished in West Bengal. Three decades of CPI(M) rule have done such immense harm to the state that its public has lost the courage to stand up against anarchy and hooliganism Does one have to be the wife of the chief minister to question an undemocratic bandh? 

 Yours faithfully,

Kunal Saha, Ohio, US

 Sir ? Meera Bhattacharjee was allowed to proceed to her workplace only after she called out to the leader of the group by his first name and reminded him of who she was (and therefore what reprisals he could expect). Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee himself took up the matter with his party later on. The first family of West Bengal, obviously, knows how to throw its weight around. Unlike its members, many people like me have to remain confined to their homes despite their unwillingness to participate in the bandh. But we wouldn?t dare to confront the groups lording over the roads for the fear of causing harm either to our own selves or to the vehicle we travel in. Had the chief minister, on the day before the bandh, said emphatically the same words his wife pronounced on the day of the bandh ? that those willing to work be allowed to do so ? the situation would have been different. 

 Yours faithfully,

K. Vara Prasada Rao, Calcutta

 Sir ? Both the chief minister of West Bengal and his wife tasted the highhandedness of their comrades on the bandh day. It?s shocking that the left?s dress rehearsal for next year?s elections should cost the nation losses more than Rs 1,000 crore. More pertinently, does Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee think that he will manage to convince investors about investing in Bengal when his party clamps down a bandh every other month? Perhaps the apex court should come down more heavily on parties that cause loss to the public exchequer.

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad

 Sir ? The Meera Bhattacharjee incident is typical of any bandh in the state. One shudders to think of the fate of any other woman in the place of Mrs Bhattacharjee. The incident sends out the wrong signal to entrepreneurs. Citu?s militant trade unionism has largely been responsible for the sorry state of affairs in the state. Admittedly, old habits die hard. In Palm Avenue, where the chief minister lives, there have been reports of business establishments being forced to down shutters. To add insult to injury, the Karaya police station is believed to have given a clean chit to the perpetrators. 

 Yours faithfully,

M. Zubair, Calcutta

 Sir ? The event the report, ?Strike truth strikes home?, brought to light is a black comedy. The leftists are getting a taste of their own medicine. As for N.R. Narayana Murthy, who still dares to think of investing in Bengal, he should prepare himself to give his employees here a few more holidays than the rest of his staff in Bangalore.

 Yours faithfully,

Abhrajit Chatterjee, Bally

 Sir ? The Meera Bhattacharjee episode made it evident that the chief minister was using his wife to get back at his party members who refuse to fall in line.

 Yours faithfully,

J. Acharya, Calcutta

 A NEW INFIRMITY

 Like the wellbeing of children, the wellbeing of the elderly indicates the level of security, civilization and sensitiveness in a society. Not necessarily prosperity or the lack of it. Neither Lakshmi Sundaram, in her flat on Bishop Lefroy Road, nor any one of her unfortunate predecessors in the recent list of the city?s elderly victims was poor. And it is in the well-settled residential areas, like Salt Lake, Alipore, Lake Gardens or Camac Street that old people, living alone or in couples, are most vulnerable. Almost in every case, the domestic help and his or her friends become immediate suspects. It is difficult to fix on the weak spot in the system. The police do request householders to provide their local stations with the references and photograph of anyone they employ. That is seldom followed, while the police find it impossible to check constantly on the elderly in their precincts. 

 While all this is true, and the suspicion directed towards domestic employees sometimes proven reasonable, the unwavering focus on their role can perhaps be misleading. It is the easy way out, a pretext to take the part for the whole. For the whole is not only a much more complicated problem, it also promises to be rather unpleasant. The vulnerability of the old in the middle of a bustling city, even when they and their children are well-established, cannot just be explained away. It would seem that domestic employees suddenly turn avaricious and murderous together the moment their employers are left alone, frail and insecure. There is here an old theory of the devilish underclass that needs careful scrutiny. It may be useful to think of other sources of and reasons for violence, in which the underprivileged domestic may or may not be used as a pawn. It is certainly worthwhile to consider, especially now, whether or not the provisions of the new West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act can encourage violence upon the old and helpless when development of a piece of property becomes a big-money issue.

 It is not unreasonable to consider, too, the obvious slackness of the law and order machinery, which has encouraged a rise in the rate of violent crime upon the helpless, whether they be women or old people in their homes. The security of the elderly may depend on how fast criminals who rob and murder their peers are caught, brought to justice and severely punished. How clear is society?s conscience on this point? The dissolution of the joint family system has not put in place an alternative system with a safety net for the aged. Caring children, if far away, can do little to reduce the sense and the reality of insecurity. The impersonal cruelty of a rapidly developing society that has only half-digested the gains and changes of a developed one is most sharply manifested in the series of incidents in which children have abused their old parents, tortured and driven them out of their own homes. It is not enough to let sniffer dogs loose in a dead woman?s home, or force sons to take back their parents. Policies to protect the old and preserve their dignity can only emerge if the aged are perceived as valuable members of society.

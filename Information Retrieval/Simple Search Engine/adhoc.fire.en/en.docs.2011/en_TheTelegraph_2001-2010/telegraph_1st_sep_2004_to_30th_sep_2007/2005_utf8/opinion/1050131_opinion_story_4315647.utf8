 NOT TOO LATE TO SEIZE THE DAY

Twenty-Twenty / Bharat Bhushan

 Entering a new phase

 Isak Chishi Swu and Thuingaleng Muivah of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah) have come to Delhi armed with the widest possible support of their people to negotiate a permanent settlement of the Naga issue. 

 The NSCN (I-M) has rooted its negotiating stance in a systematic garnering of public support. All Naga civil society and tribal organizations including the tribal Hohos have been consulted. This support was consolidated by organizing the Fourth Naga Peoples? Consultative Meeting for strengthening the India-Naga Political Talks over two days ? January 20 and 21. Two representatives from each Naga village in Nagaland, Manipur, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh attended the consultations. They were amongst the more than 6,500 delegates who attended the consultations with the NSCN (I-M) leadership in a jungle camp near Dimapur.

 In short, the Nagas seem well prepared to settle the issue. The question, however, is: Is the government of India ready?

 Unfortunately, the indications are not very encouraging at this juncture. The substantive talks are two days away and the Indian team has not been announced. The note to constitute a three-member cabinet sub-committee to negotiate with the Nagas was moved barely three days ago. The net result is that the cabinet sub-committee has not yet been announced. There is no question, therefore, of any detailed briefings of its members. Imagine India going to a test match with the potential team members never having played cricket, leave alone having had sufficient net practice.

 Indications are that the cabinet sub-committee will be chaired by the minister of state for programme implementation, Oscar Fernandes ? the other two members are expected to be the minister of state in the prime minister?s office, Prithviraj Chauhan, and the minister of state for home, S. Raghupathy. But they do not know as yet what is expected of them.

 Resolving an insurgency that has gone on for fifty years is a tall order. Its solution will touch issues that concern the very foundation of the Indian Union. In this day and age, forcing a union on any minority that is as determined as the Nagas would no doubt be an act of monstrous tyranny. However, today, the Nagas seem mentally prepared to move towards a renegotiated union. This opportunity ought not to get lost in the cobwebs of status quoist thinking.

 The question, therefore, is what should the cabinet sub-committee members do in the extremely short time they would get to prepare for the talks? Can the situation still be salvaged? The answer has to be yes even if the government seems far too distracted to realize that the Naga issue is ripe for settlement. 

 The Indian negotiators, even if they cannot read up on the stormy character of the relationship of the Nagas with New Delhi, must suspend their instinctive reactions to the Naga insurgency. If the Nagas complain about the duplicity of India in dealing with them, it is no use countering this argument. In retrospect, it is evident that New Delhi perpetrated one fraud after another on the Nagas beginning with the Akbar Hyderi Agreement right down to the Shillong Accord. 

 Defending these failed agreements will in no way advance India?s immediate interests. Nor would an instinctive harking back to the framework of the Indian constitution help. In fact, this approach might damage the long-term relationship with the NSCN (I-M) and the Nagas.

 Past experience shows that Indian negotiators get agitated when the Nagas reject the Indian constitution, are critical of Nehru, or use phrases such as ?you bloody Indians? in anger and exasperation on feeling cheated. The simplest thing to do then is to recognize what can provoke you as an Indian representative, and not react.

 It is important for the Nagas to verbalize their history. The Indian negotiators should not get impatient even if they think everything has been said already. The Nagas come from a strong oral tradition. It is important not to get impatient, and listen actively to them. If Isak Swu recounts the Naga problem, it is perfectly natural for Muivah to go over the same ground adding details and interpretation.

 The Indian side must engage with them by summarizing what they have understood and by seeking clarifications. The Nagas should not only know that they have been understood but also that their point of view and feelings have been appreciated. If the Nagas feel hurt by the atrocities of the Indian security forces, it is important to at least offer a personal apology instead of rationalizing rape and burning of homes. Accepting boldly that the Nagas have been wronged will strengthen the negotiating process and help in the process of reconciliation. 

 Swu and Muivah are not ordinary political leaders. They are leaders of an underground government and a well-structured army. They have spent more than a month in Nagaland consolidating their legitimacy and authority. Their competence and authority to negotiate the Naga issue has to be acknowledged at each step of the negotiations. 

 The Indian negotiators would do well to contrast the Indian situation with the NSCN leaders. In underground organizations, leadership has to be earned the hard way ? money cannot buy it and vote-stuffing and false promises will not catapult you to the top. With such leadership comes tremendous amount of respect and unflinching loyalty where youngsters are willing to lay down their lives for you. There is not a single leader in India for whom even five educated and sober 21-year olds will give up their lives. More than 3,000 would do so at the bidding of Muivah and Swu. Unless the Indian side understands the strength of these two leaders, they would not be able to create a favourable climate for the successful peace talks.

 Only when the trust of the other side has been gained in this manner can a substantive dialogue for resolving the issue begin in earnest. The Nagas have submitted two sets of proposals to New Delhi ? a document called ?Proposed basis for discussion to achieve a comprehensive solution to the Indo-Naga issue? on September 21, 2001; and a ?Memorandum on the state of negotiations? on April 1, 2004. The latter is more important because it prioritizes the issues for the negotiations.

 There may be some difficult proposals in these two documents but there is nothing that cannot be resolved ? some issues can be reframed instead of rejecting them outright, for some time can be bought if the intention is sincere and for others, joint strategies can be worked out. It is important to remember that the Nagas have not come as supplicants and New Delhi is not in the role of a patron accepting or rejecting a demand.

 The Naga issue will eventually be resolved jointly when the two sides get into each other?s shoes. Both the Indians and the Nagas will have to learn to retreat from verbalized and stated positions to reach a path which would advance the interests of both. 

 Today an opportunity exists for doing this. But we must hasten slowly. A five-decade old issue will not get resolved in five days or even five weeks. However, patience and respect for the other side has the possibility of leading us to peace with the Nagas.

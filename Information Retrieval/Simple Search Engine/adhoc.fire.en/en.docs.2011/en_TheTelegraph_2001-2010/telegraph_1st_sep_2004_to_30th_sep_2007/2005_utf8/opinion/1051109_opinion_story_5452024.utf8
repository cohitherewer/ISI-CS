 UNNECESSARY

 A minister without portfolio is a contradiction in terms. It suggests one of two things, neither of which is particularly complimentary to the holder of such a post: one is that the man is a busybody, and two, that he is not fit to hold any particular portfolio but has to be accommodated for one reason or another. Mr K. Natwar Singh, India?s foreign minister who has recently stepped down, finds himself, alas, in the latter category. He has nobody to blame, save himself, for this plight. He could have avoided this indignity by resigning from the Union cabinet instead of seeking some kind of accommodation. If Mr Singh believes that this is a face-saver, then he is harbouring an illusion. Being a minister without a job is not a position that can command any kind of respect anywhere. It is difficult to explain what compels Mr Singh to cling to a ministerial berth after being forced to quit from his position as minister for external affairs. Now he has been reduced to a position where he has neither power nor responsibility.

 If Mr Singh?s motives for staying on as minister without portfolio are difficult to follow, equally incomprehensible is the decision to keep him in the Union cabinet with an utterly meaningless ministerial berth. As it is the prime minister, for reasons relating to coalition politics, has an over- sized cabinet. The number of ministers only adds to red tape and declining productivity. To this has now been added a minister who has no specific responsibility. One can only guess that the prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, due to political compulsions, was forced to accept a risible compromise. Mr Natwar Singh had manifestly made himself an embarrassment to the prime minister and to the Congress president, Ms Sonia Gandhi. He was also oblivious to the embarrassment that he was causing. Despite this, and the shadow of suspicion that had fallen on his reputation, the prime minister could not rid himself of Mr Singh completely. Moreover, it took an inordinately long time for the prime minister to decide what to do with Mr Singh. This has not enhanced the prime minister?s reputation as a man who knows his own mind and as one who acts decisively. The entire episode, and its handling, has something unsavoury about it and therefore it is somewhat apt that the upshot is a compromise which makes a needless and irrelevant addition to the Union cabinet.

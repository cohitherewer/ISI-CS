 Letters to Editor

 Welcome visitors

 Sir ? The government?s approval to proposals for the punishment of brothel clients is another step towards removing the legal bias that exists against women, in this case, sex workers (?Stick awaits brothel clients?, Nov 27). They are the ones who get arrested or pay the penalty when apprehended, while the men, who are equally involved in the perpetuation of the offence, are allowed to go free. However, the proposal to prevent prosecution for ?soliciting and loitering? is weird. It will only convert public places like bus stops, railway stations, shopping malls and so on into convenient places for sex workers to solicit clients. This will lead to indecency and offend public morality. As it is, sex work or prostitution is today rampant among young college girls. The amendment will give a fillip to such activities. Are law-makers and women?s organizations aware of the social implications of the proposed change in law?

 Yours faithfully,

Radhika Debnath, Calcutta

 Sir ? ?Stick awaits brothel clients? makes for bizarre news. A brothel client is usually there to satisfy his natural instincts. He has not raped, molested or murdered anyone. He only has consensual sex, which is essentially a private affair between two consenting adults. This is an assertion of the sexual partners? individual liberty and the state must not intrude upon it. The proposed legislation will only benefit policemen who will continue to collect money, now from both sex workers and their clients, and continue to harass individuals who pose no threat to social order. 

 In a dynamic society, there are several demographic factors ? migratory workforce, inconvenient working hours, inverse spousal age difference to name a few ? that deny men?s access to conjugal sex. Add to it the inevitable physiological factors, wives? illness or reluctance to have sex, and one may realize the need for prostitutes. Taslima Nasreen writes in her autobiography, Aamaar Meyebelaa, that scriptures permit husbands to beat their wives for four reasons, refusing sex being one of them (there is a comparable English adage to this as well). The law of the land, unfortunately, does not permit that. In such a situation, before enacting the regulation, the state should ensure the following things. One, that all wives provide nocturnal service to their respective husbands, wholeheartedly, and to their satisfaction. And two, that the state bears the cost of hormone replacement therapy for menopausal wives. Before these are done, the state has no moral authority to enact such a law.

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Pal, Batanagar

 Sir ? The proposed change in the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, will go a long way in reducing atrocities against sex workers and curb the propensity to visit brothels, particularly among the youth. Sex workers now have much reason to feel relieved as they are constantly questioned, manhandled and harassed by the police in the name of ?cleansing? society. Now that the legal parameters have been properly spelt out, unscrupulous policemen will think twice before they undertake a ?drive? against sex workers. 

 It should be kept in mind that sex work is often not a profession a woman chooses willingly. Poverty, crime and other compulsions force women into the racket. Besides, in this trade which is hugely profitable to the middlemen, the women who do the work remain the most exploited. The legislation may reduce this exploitation to some degree. But the most significant aspect is the possibility of its serving as a deterrent to youths who feel encouraged by the mild warnings with which they are let off after being apprehended. Inexperienced and inept, they bring home and spread the most serious, life-threatening infections. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bijoy Ranjan Dey, Tinsukia, 

 Sir ? This refers to the most appalling amendment to an existing law proposed by the government ? not to prosecute prostitutes for ?soliciting and loitering?. Such a preposterous move will only encourage them to try and pick up clients from anywhere possible. Sex workers are already a visible presence in several major bus stops and thoroughfares of the city by late evening. It will be extremely difficult for the police to catch the offenders during the act as they can claim that they were merely ?soliciting? and not indulging in the act itself. The move literally means legalizing prostitution. 

 Yours faithfully,

Anju Jain, Calcutta

 Death summons

 Sir ? ?Life-or-death guide on anvil? (Nov 26) is good news to scores of terminally-ill patients and their near and dear ones. It will give respite to the helpless kin of many who are forced to continue the life-support system for patients who are as good as dead. Now they can bid farewell without living through the emotional trauma day after day. It will also reduce the financial strain and take off them the pressure of shuffling between work and personal commitments. 

 The proposed guidelines for limitation of life-support treatment for dying patients will open up a Pandora?s box. There are many questions that will need to be answered ? like who in the family will be vested with the right to give the consent? And what about the different religions and the acts governing them? The Indian Society of Critical Care Medicine should be cautious while introducing the guidelines as many lives will depend on their being logical and foolproof. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bipasha Lahiri, Hyderabad

 Sir ? Given the thoroughly corrupt healthcare system, is it safe to introduce such freedom in deciding whether treatment is to be withdrawn from a patient who is just presumed to be dying? The doctor may be easily bribed into declaring the futility of life support for the benefit of greedy relatives. A system which gives patients hardly any say, cannot boast of giving patients the right to choose between life and death.

 Yours faithfully,

J. Acharya, Calcutta

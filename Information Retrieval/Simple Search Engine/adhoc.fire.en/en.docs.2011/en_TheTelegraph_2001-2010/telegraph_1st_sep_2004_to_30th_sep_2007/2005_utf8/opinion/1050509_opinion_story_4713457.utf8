 A LETTER A DAY KEEPS ANAEMIA AT BAY

 MIND THE GAP

 The world may revolve around the email, but India?s affair with the snail mail continues

 Horace Walpole once lamented that letter-writing is a lost art. With more and more people dumping the tangible letter for the intangible email, the lament seems truer now than ever before. Even the fan mails have become fan-emails ? no longer vibrant with the red hue of the fan?s blood. But India has still managed to keep the anaemia at bay. 

 Uma Bharti?s political future may appear bleak, but she could well flourish as a letter writer, if her recent epistolary volleys at L.K. Advani are anything to go by. They covered a range of emotions ? accusing other party members of sycophancy and conspiracy, expressing her ideological differences with Advani, and a myriad others. 

 The BJP president has little reason to ?look forward to the arrival of the post?, as Dr Johnson would. It is less likely to contain ?a letter from an old friend; a brief note from someone I love; a letter from a foreign land; a letter from a stranger congratulating me upon my wisdom? than angry outpourings from an Uma Bharti or a K.S. Sudarshan. A letter a day probably leads his temper astray. But he may take heart from Voltaire, who actually enjoyed receiving hate-letters and replied to one correspondent: ?I am seated in the smallest room in the house. I have your letter before me. Soon it will be behind me.? 

 Forget political skirmishes. India?s latest live soap opera, of the Ambani family, started with an apparently innocuous letter from Anil to Mukesh, with queries on company matters. However, it appears that the correspondence in this widely televised drama is now mostly in emails. And they have an uncanny habit of finding their way to the public domain. 

 Then there are the letters to the editors, to the agony aunts and to the beauty-secret columnists. And although many of these are emailed, there are still the old die-hards, believing in the sanctity and gravity induced by the combination of paper and ink. 

 Most English curricula in the country include formal ?letter writing?, probably to train students in the art of taking on the bureaucracy, the single largest recipient of letters in India. Any person wishing to perfect his letter-writing skills should engage the Indian government in any dispute. The dispute may never be resolved, but his letter-writing is guaranteed to touch lofty heights. 

 The most frightening letters are those which contain your bank statement at the end of each quarter. Summons from courts are equally disturbing, while innocuous offer-letters tucked inside magazines can spoil the reader?s mood. 

 And so, now, even without famous epistolarians like Nehru, Tagore or Ghalib, the Indian postal service is in robust health. With 1,55,618 permanent post offices and 255.1 million post card traffic, India?s affair with letters continues. So what if some of them take years to reach?

 THE COLOUR MAY BLEED AT TIMES

 It might appear contradictory, but reality demands that the CPI(M) courts the hardline or softline according to the situation, writes Sumanta Sen

 Doing it right

 For quite some time now, there has been talk about ?hardliners? and ?softliners? in the Communist Party of India (Marxist). The election of Prakash Karat as the party?s general-secretary had been preceded by speculations about the party following a more rigid line, particularly in its relations with the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government. If reports are correct, Karat had to dispel doubts at a dinner hosted by the prime minister. So has Karat now become ?soft??

 Such descriptions are somewhat misleading. They may be useful in keeping alive the theory that down the line, the Marxists are a divided lot ? a theory that does not seem to take into account that nobody has ever denied their allegiance to the party congress, either within or without. Not that there are no differences, but these are accepted in any communist party as a fact of life and they are indeed indicative of the party being a living organ. But the differences are more about the tactical line at any given point of time. It is not as if Karat and some others wish to be daggers drawn at all times while Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee wants to walk along a course of no-confrontation. Marxists both, they know neither of the two paths can be traversed by the party.

 Take Bhattacharjee for instance. When he was the minister for information and cultural affairs, he had become famous for his tirade against ?apasanskriti? (perverse culture), suggesting thereby that he was a cultural hardliner. Since he became the chief minister, Calcutta has seen the growth of a kind of night life that is very much ?apasanskriti? by the same definition, but is now accepted as an essential part of the larger industrial culture. Bhattacharjee is silent today because he wants industries badly. So is he a hardliner turned soft, or is he a hardliner who has learnt to accommodate a soft line when the situation demands it? Either way then, there is no contradiction between the two positions.

 Prakash Karat himself is another case in point. If he were a true ?hardliner?, he would have given priority to people?s agitations over electoral alliances for the party?s growth in the Hindi belt. Instead, at his first press conference on assuming office, he talked about forging an electoral third front even though a supposedly ?softliner? like Harkishen Singh Surjeet had spoken against this. Here also, Karat has not given up any basic ?hardness?, but he feels that a proper electoral alliance is the easier way to get a toehold in new grounds. Once again, it is a question of responding to the situation as it exists, without losing sight of the real objective.

 The situation at hand and the larger goal have not been avoided in the just concluded 18th congress. Bhattacharjee?s actions on the West Bengal industrial front, including wooing foreign direct investment and keeping a hold on trade unionism, have been approved because the party realizes that there was no other path he could have chosen for himself. He has been more fortunate than his predecessor, who had a real tough time trying to get the party to agree to the entry of private capital in the proposed Haldia petrochemicals project. At the same time, the party is aware that in states where it is not in power, it will have to wage a more militant struggle both on the workers? and peasants? front, and there is nothing to suggest that Bhattacharjee is against that. Some may see a double-standard in this but reality demands that the party as a whole be both hard and soft, depending on its own position.

 There are other instances of this. Take the question of fundamentalism. The church has never been treated the same way as Hindu fundamentalists or Muslims, because in the overall context, the party did not see the church posing much of a problem, despite its presence in Kerala. But in Tripura, the CPI(M) has always been vocal against the Baptist missionaries for allegedly fomenting separatism. This seeming variation in the party line never bothered the central committee for the objective conditions in the North-east are not the same as elsewhere in the country. Manik Sarkar?s stand against the church in Agartala did not make him a hardliner.

 Since the election of the new politburo, there has been a lot of concern about the inclusion of Centre of Indian Trade Union leader, Chittabrata Mazumdar. Fears are being expressed that this would make the party adopt a more rigid stance on labour-related issues. What seems to be forgotten is that a party wedded to the principle of class struggle has to remain rigid on such issues, irrespective of individuals in the policy-making body. Even a softliner like Jyoti Basu has repeatedly stressed that there can be no question of the party staying away from or not organizing struggles of the working people. While advocating caution and restraint, even Bhattacharjee has not moved away from this basic position nor has hardliner Mazumdar ever said that restraint should be thrown to the winds. If there does exist a contradiction between the two, or the supposed camps they belong to, then it is at best a non-antagonistic contradiction.

 The problem faced by the CPI(M) is not related to individuals. It is the problem of charting a course of action in a situation for which no guideline is available. No other communist party in the world has had to run governments within a system which it is ideologically committed to wreck. So in West Bengal, as also in Tripura and Kerala, it has always been a process of trial and error. The party has tripped on a number of occasions but so far, has always been able to save itself from tumbling down. Both hard and soft individuals have participated equally in this journey and continue to do so. It is doubtful if the little progress that the party has made would have been possible if one side had tried to shove the other out of the way. Today the path for the party has become even more tortuous as it has to come to terms with a new economic situation and the Karats and the Yechuris know they will have to put their heads together. Differences will certainly continue to crop up, but more over ways in which the party programme should be implemented, and not over the programme itself. Indeed as long as the programme remains Marxist, the party as a whole will be a hardliner, even as observers seek to discover patches of softness.

 Letters to Editor

 Sex is for adults

 Sir ? Is having sex, as an adult, a crime? Surely not. Should having sex on camera, for a consenting adult, then be a crime? Logically, also not. So one fails to comprehend why the Jammu police and Anara Gupta?s family are both intent on proving or disproving whether it is Gupta or some other woman in the now-infamous CD. If the point is that Gupta has been ?taken advantage of? by some people who promised her a role in films, it is surely they, and not Gupta, who should be the target of the investigation. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Biswapriya Purkayastha, Shillong 

 Facile comments

 Sir ? Bibek Debroy?s analysis of Indian rape laws in ?Intending to outrage? (Feb 3) is skewed. He relies blindly on the work done by the task force on women and children and the national women?s commission. Women?s rights and human-rights groups in India have had problems with the recommendations of the 172nd report of the law commission of India and the Malimath committee on criminal justice reforms, which Debroy is advocating. Though he lays bare the problems of the existing laws, his analysis is superficial and does not consider the stand of feminists on issues of bodily integrity and sexual autonomy. He merely quotes sections and talks about their inadequacies. While talking about sexual violence, he completely ignores Section 377 of the IPC which has been a major cause of concern for not just the women?s movement but also for gay and lesbian rights, and child rights groups. 

 Debroy would do well to refrain from writing on issues that he isn?t an expert on. 

 Yours faithfully,

Oishik Sircar, Pune

 Sir ? It is wonderful that the Supreme Court has ordered the setting up of prevention of sexual harassment cells on university campuses. But it will be of no use unless the girls come forward to report cases. Today the malaise of sexual harassment has spread to schools too. Young teachers, fresh from university, are especially vulnerable to the advances of higher authorities. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Duty to give

 Sir ? The manner in which the Centre has circumvented the Supreme Court in the ITC case by issuing an ordinance is shocking (?Duty demon back for ITC?, Jan 30). This is the second time that a Congress-led regime has cocked its snook at the apex court. The first time was when Rajiv Gandhi used his massive majority in the Lok Sabha to overturn the court in the Shah Bano case. It is now clear that the judiciary is no refuge for the citizen against state excesses.

 Yours faithfully,

C.V.K. Moorthy, Calcutta

 Sir ? Not only does the January 25 ordinance overrule the apex court, but it also gives the government the power to make excise rules retrospectively. Much is made of the sangh parivar saying that it will not honour the apex court?s verdict in the Ramjanmabhoomi case. Now it is the secularists, led by the Congress and the left, who are guilty of the same crime. 

 Yours faithfully,

Udita Agrawal, New Delhi

 Sir ? Central excise is a relic from the socialist era and even then, MRP was a feeble effort to protect the buyer. Liberalization, and now VAT, have made all this irrelevant. Thus it is unfortunate that the government is demanding, even after the Supreme Court rejected its case, that ITC pay Rs 803 crore, because its traders allegedly sold its cigarettes at prices higher than the MRP marked on the cigarette packets. 

 Yours faithfully,

 N. Narasimhan, Bangalore

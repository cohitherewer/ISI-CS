 EXPORT VISTA

 The minister of commerce and industry, Mr Kamal Nath, has urged exporters to take Indian merchandise exports to $100 billion this fiscal, $7 billion more than the earlier target. Merchandise exports amounted to $81 billion in the financial year 2004-05, according to the revised estimates of trade data available from the Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics, which means that the minister is pegging a growth target of 23.5 per cent. At first sight, that seems like a tall order, but exports have been doing exceptionally well in recent years, and the growth rate was as high as 26 per cent last fiscal. What?s more, this year has seen a continuation of this sizzling rate of growth, with exports rising by 28 per cent in October, and by 22 per cent during the April to October period. Rising exports are a good indicator not only of India?s commercial engagement with the rest of the world, but also of the sea change in the competitiveness of India Inc. The ratio of merchandise exports to gross domestic product has gone up from 6.4 per cent in 1990-91 to 9 per cent at the turn of the century, and the ratio will be around 12 per cent if the $100 billion target is achieved this year. Seen together with the rise in the export of services ? estimated to be around $50 billion this year ? there?s little doubt that India has increasingly been able to find a place in global trade.

 However, the growth in exports has been accompanied in recent months by a greater increase in imports, and the current account deficit in the first quarter of the year is almost equal to the entire deficit for 2004-05. With a slowdown in foreign institutional inflows, there have been some concerns about the financing of this deficit. As a result, the rupee has been under pressure, dropping to a 13-month low against the dollar in recent weeks. That should further boost exports, and indeed, the second quarter results of the IT service companies show higher profits as a result of rupee depreciation. Nevertheless, it needs to be remembered that in spite of the export boom, India?s share in world merchandise exports is still only around 0.9 per cent, below Thailand?s 1.1 per cent, and far below China?s 6.5 per cent. The Reserve Bank of India?s policy of allowing the rupee to depreciate, accordingly, is the right one. As for the government, it must act quickly to improve infrastructure constraints such as congestion at the ports, while continuing to liberalize documentation for exports.

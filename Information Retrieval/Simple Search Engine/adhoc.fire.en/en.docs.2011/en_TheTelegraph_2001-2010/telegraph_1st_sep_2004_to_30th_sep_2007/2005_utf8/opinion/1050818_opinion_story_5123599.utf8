 Letters to Editor

 To have to say sorry

 Sir ? It is indeed magnanimous of the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, to say that ?on behalf of our government, on behalf of the entire people of this country, I bow my head in shame? for the anti-Sikh riots in 1984 (?Shame on Day II of penitence?, Aug 12). Singh?s scholarship, commitment, integrity, patriotism and loyalty towards his country and his fellow citizens are beyond question or doubt. Yet, his offer of apology does not impress. An unqualified apology and a solemn pledge to desist from acting communally must come from the Congress, and not from Singh, who was not even in the national political picture when Indira Gandhi was assassinated.

 Yours faithfully,

S.C. Kapoor, Noida

 Sir ? The clean and honest image of Manmohan Singh has been given a boost by his apology in parliament. But the law must take its course and the culprits of 1984 must be punished. The history of our country shows that since independence, there has been a huge number of crimes committed by politically-powerful criminals, but only a handful of them have been punished. I hope that the case of the anti-Sikh riots will be an exception. 

 Yours faithfully,

M. Kumar, Delhi

 Sir ? The list of the Congress?s failures is endless, besides its multiple attempts to protect ?tainted? leaders. The people of India do not wish that the prime minister should apologize for the atrocities committed against the Sikhs 21 years ago, but for the fact that no action had been taken for 21 years against the leaders of the mobs which went about killing Sikh men, women and children. The Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government should not have waited for the opposition and left parties to demand the resignations of Jagdish Tytler and Sajjan Kumar. They should have been made to quit as soon as G.T. Nanavati submitted his report to the government.

 Yours faithfully,

V. Krishnakumar, New Delhi 

 Sir ? Manmohan Singh does seem to be an honest and sincere man, so the country will now hope that he will act on his assurance of investigating the role of ?all those against whom the commission drew adverse inference? in the 1984 riots. Even if justice finally reaches the families of the victims, the ruling and opposition parties must come together and take a pledge to end all kinds of communal violence in the country.

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

 Sir ? Most of us know most of the time what is the right thing to do, but very often, we do not have the courage to do it. This courage comes from values and convictions. Sonia Gandhi knew that it would not be right for her to be the prime minister, and she had the courage to decline the position. Manmohan Singh has been extremely courageous in apologizing to the nation on behalf of his party and the nation for the massacre of 1984. This may not be good politics, but it is very good statesmanship. It?s time Atal Bihari Vajpayee too apologized for the Gujarat carnage.

 Yours faithfully,

Pranav Sachdeva, New Delhi

 Sir ? There is precious little difference between New Delhi and Northern Ireland in the cover-up, by politicians and other interested parties, of the slaughter of Sikhs in 1984 and of Catholics in 1972 and 1989. Judicial and other enquiries get delayed on one pretext or another. Manmohan Singh has apologized; will Tony Blair follow suit and will either, or both, bring to justice those known to be responsible? Sadly, the world?s experience, in recent times, says otherwise. Pinochet in Chile claims he is geriatric, someone in New Delhi pleads dementia, the butchers of Croatia and Bosnia have been left untouched for some other reason. Yet, at the end of World War II, the victorious Allies were swift to punish those they considered ?war criminals?.

 Yours faithfully,

Saroj Kumar Mehera, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Now the prime minister has said sorry to the nation and decided that compensation will be paid to the survivors of the massacre. But since the violence and slaughter were committed by Congress leaders and workers, this compensation must be paid from the Congress party funds alone, and not from the exchequer. If paid from public money, it would create a fiscal deficit and, consequently, the finance minister would impose taxes on the common people to plug the deficit. I wish that people would raise their voice for payment from the Congress funds, so that other parties become more careful about committing violent and destructive acts.

 Yours faithfully,

B.S. Ganesh, Bangalore 

 Sir ? Did Manmohan Singh realize that when he apologized in parliament, he was contradicting what his home minister, Shivraj Patil, had said about the Nanavati commission?s report in the same premises? This exposes the lack of cohesion and coordination within the Congress and among the members of the cabinet. If the home minister feels he was right about the action-taken report, then he ought to resign for being overrun by the prime minister. But, of course, in Indian politics, the pull of a cabinet berth is above all else.

 Yours faithfully,

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? The prime minister offering an unconditional apology for the 1984 killings of Sikhs, on behalf of the government, after a gap of more than two decades, is nothing short of a joke. Singh, being a Sikh himself, has no reason to tender an apology for 1984. Instead, he should have asked for an apology from the party, or refused to work under a lady whose husband was the prime minister during the killings, but never apologized.

 Yours faithfully,

Gauranga Bhattacharya, Midnapur

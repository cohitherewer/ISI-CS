 BANK ON IT

 The guidelines issued by the finance ministry to grant more managerial autonomy to public sector banks is welcome, and the Sensex?s response, through banking sector stocks moving upwards, reflects this. Without seeking permission from the finance ministry, such banks can now enter into new lines of business (insurance, mutual funds, project financing), float subsidiaries, open overseas branches, decide on mergers and acquisitions, shut down unviable branches or lines of business, fix accountability policies and hire sector specialists, including fixing their remunerations through independent boards. Having welcomed the general thrust of the new guidelines, some caveats are in order. First, it is not clear whether permissions will now surface through the Reserve Bank of India or standardized pay structures issued by Indian Banks? Association. Second, if boards are truly independent, why retain appointment of chairman and managing directors and executive directors with the government? If nothing else, this will constrain pay packages of CMDs and executive directors and thereby also constrain packages that can be granted to specialized staff. Third, does the government need to differentiate between strong and weak banks, the latter defined primarily as banks with three-year profitability track records, capital adequacy ratios of 9 per cent or more and net non-performing assets of 4 per cent or less? 

 While notions of strong and weak do exist, such identifications are best left to the market and any board decisions would naturally reflect these. Stated differently, since the government will continue to hold 51 per cent equity, although there is no reason why it should (notwithstanding left opposition), can?t the government make its views known through government directors, instead of retaining these vestiges of control? It should also be remembered that banks are not set up under the Companies Act and the relevant nationalization acts make it clear that the government retains control, even if government equity is lower than 51 per cent. In addition, the Banking Regulation Act still remains. Among other things, this constrains mergers of nationalized banks and new lines of business banks can enter into. Nor will banks be freed from the Central Vigilance Commission and the Central Bureau of Investigation. Unshackling public sector banks to enable them to handle competition, is a laudable objective and so is the level playing field argument. But one should be clear that only some shackles have been removed. Some speculation about timing of these guidelines is also possible. With populist expenditure-type pressures, the finance minister will be hard-pressed to establish his reformist credentials.

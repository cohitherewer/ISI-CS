 Paperback Pickings

 Chooey-booey and brown

A matter of taste: The Penguin book of indian writing 

on food (Penguin, Rs 450) edited by Nilanjana S. Roy is a thoroughly 

delightful anthology ? light-hearted, entertaining, richly varied and serious, 

without being pompously post-colonial or anthropological. The editor?s acknowledged 

?benchmark? is this statement in Mark Kurlansky?s Choice Cuts: ?There is 

simply no better way for a writer to approach the fundamental subjects of the 

human condition than to talk about the food we choose to ingest.? Roy?s selection 

includes, among other morsels, Rushdie?s leavened bread and chutney, Gandhi?s 

experiments with meat (?Every time I dropped off to sleep it would seem as though 

a live goat were bleating inside me...?), Forster?s complex thali in the 

Rajah?s banquet room (?Another sauce, chooey-booey and brown.?), Amitav Ghosh?s 

?Tibetan Dinner? and Sarat Chandra Chatterjee?s ?Mahesh?. There is a brilliantly 

put together section called ?Deprivation? with Bibhutibhushan?s hungry Apu and 

Mahasweta Devi?s ?Salt?. Roy spells out some central questions in her introduction: 

?Who gets to eat? Who?s denied food? What are the systems by which we legitimize 

denial??

Under an Indian sky: Ten years in a bihar village 

(Penguin, Rs 250) by Janet Ganguli is a lucid and poignant account 

of an English Quaker nurse?s years, from 1975 onwards, living and working as a 

volunteer in a little village in the Santhal Parganas (then in Bihar and now part 

of Jharkhand). ?...I feel overwhelmed by the immense loss of all the latent talent, 

skill and accomplishment of so many millions of people, these inhabitants of another 

world who are denied the possibility of reaching their full potential. One glimpsed 

it in their innate skill, grace, artistry and physical stamina, but how much they 

might have been able to contribute to human knowledge and well-being will never 

be known.?

The penguin swami vivekananda reader (Penguin, 

Rs 395) edited by Makarand Paranjape is the first major independently 

edited selection from Vivekananda?s speeches, essays, letters, conversations with 

a biography and scholarly introduction. ?I would say, the combination of the Greek 

mind represented by the external European energy added to the Hindu spirituality 

would be an ideal society for India.?

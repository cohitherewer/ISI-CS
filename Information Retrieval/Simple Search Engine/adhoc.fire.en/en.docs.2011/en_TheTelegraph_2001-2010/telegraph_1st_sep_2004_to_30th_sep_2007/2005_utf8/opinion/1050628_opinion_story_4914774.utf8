 Letters to Editor

 Clash course

 Sir ? The incident of the barge getting stuck under Howrah Bridge on June 25 could have been avoided if the tide tables had been read carefully. There were two very high spring tides on June 23 and 24. After the tsunami, water levels all along the coastal areas of Bay of Bengal have risen. Calcutta Port Trust should have issued a warning to all ships plying under the bridge to take heed of these changed tidal levels. On July 23 and 24, 2005, there is likely to be a much higher tide at around the same time of the day, as also in August. Adequate precautions need to be taken if the bridge is to be protected and accidents avoided.

 Yours faithfully,

Francis Xavier N, Port Blair, Andamans

 Sir ? The front-page report, ?Some scars will never heal? (June 27) informs that the Howrah bridge was built by Burn, Braithwaite Jessop. But only a couple of days ago, the report, ?Floating pontoon to icon of Calcutta?, had stated that the construction of the bridge was awarded to the British firm, Cleveland Bridge and Engineering Company Ltd on the basis of a global tender. Could The Telegraph please clarify which of these two contradictory information is correct? 

 Yours faithfully,

Dipakranjan Ray, Calcutta

 Sir ? ?Punishment cry for river traffic rogues? (June 26) reveals yet another saga of utter confusion among the various departments of the state administration. This does not augur well for matters of national safety. One shudders to think what would have happened if the Howrah Bridge had collapsed ? which could have happened if MV Moni had got stuck on June 24 instead of the next day. Now statutory bodies like the Calcutta Port Trust,the state transport department, the Inland Waterways Authority of India, the Bargeowners? Association and so on have been trying to pass the buck among themselves. It is difficult to say who will take the responsibility of prosecuting and finally punishing the offenders. It is the government?s duty to clearly assign the responsibilities of specific departments, without leaving any scope of ambiguity. 

 Yours faithfully,

Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

 Sir ? It has been mentioned in the report on the collision of MV Moni with the Howrah Bridge that M.S. Baruah, the master of the barge, who was at the wheel at the time of the collision, is 66 years old. It is surprising that such an elderly person ? people over 60 are normally lacking in alertness and quick reflexes ? was allowed to operate the barge. Is there no retirement age for these professionals? 

 Yours faithfully,

C.V.K. Moorthy, Calcutta

 Sir ? Most Calcuttans will shudder at the possibility of the Howrah Bridge closed to traffic for a long time. The stoppage of traffic on the bridge on Friday for a brief while was enough to upset the traffic coordination of the entire city. The incident pointed out once more how urgently the city needs another bridge of similar traffic capacity near the Howrah Bridge, in addition to the Vidyasagar Setu. Calcutta, which used to be second to London among the cities of the Empire, can again look to the British capital, where there are half a dozen bridges over the Thames close to one another. 

 Another thing. Why can?t there be a warning line across the length of the bridge ? about a metre below the lowest girder ? programmed to set off a loud warning if any vessel touches or brushes against the line. It would work somewhat like a burglar alarm, but it should send across audio-visual warning to the nearest office of the port authority as well as at both ends of the bridge where policemen are posted. This is the best possible safeguard against unfortunate accidents like the one that occurred last week. 

 Yours faithfully,

K.B. Goswami, Calcutta

 Sir ? Till now rash driving was limited to roads. Now, it seems, it is as much of a reality on the waters. The fault must lie with the master of the barge who did not bother about the height clearance while moving below a colossal structure like the Howrah Bridge (but then again, is there any signboard under the bridge specifying the height clearance?). A water traffic safety code needs to be put in place immediately. I feel that any vessel moving below Howrah Bridge should have a security clearance from the coast guards. Provided, of course, that our coast guards have their boats working, unlike their hovercrafts.

 Yours faithfully,

Abhijit Das, Singapore

 Sir ? For a city already reeling under the effect of the civic polls, the hit in the belly of one of its most prized possessions is a very costly one ? no less than Rs 1.5 crore. Will the Port Trust file a legal suit against the barge owners? Or is it going pay for the repairs from its own pocket? Let us hope that henceforth, the river transport authorities will be more alert about the traffic movements under the bridge. 

 Yours faithfully,

Joy Mallick, Calcutta

 Sir ? More bizarre than the incident of the barge getting stuck under the Howrah bridge was the attitude of the master of MV Moni. Not only did he seem totally unperturbed by the seriousness of the damage caused and the difficulties faced by the public because of his mistake, he even had the guts to demand a compensation for the damage caused to his vessel. Did he do it with an eye to lessening the extent of the punishment? Or does he think that the media and the public will rally behind him for having fallen to the floor under the impact of the collision? The Calcutta Port Trust must be strict in its dealings with him.

 Yours faithfully,

Anagh Pal, Calcutta

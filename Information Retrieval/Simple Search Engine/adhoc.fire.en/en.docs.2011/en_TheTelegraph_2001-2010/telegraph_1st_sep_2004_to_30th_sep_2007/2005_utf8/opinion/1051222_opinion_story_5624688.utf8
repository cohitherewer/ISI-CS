 ON AN EMPTY STOMACH

 JAYDEV JANA

 An advisor to the commissioner of the Supreme Court has recently informed the apex institution of two incidents of hunger death in the Jalpaiguri district. Widespread poverty resulting in chronic and persistent hunger is the single biggest scourge in the developing world today. There is ample evidence to show that many diseases that afflict adults may have also been ?programmed? by malnutrition, which reduces individual productivity and enhances child mortality rates.

 India?s overall record in eliminating hunger and undernourishment is quite terrible. In the past five decades, the country has witnessed a quantum leap in food production but incidents of hunger deaths continue to occur in particular regions across India. Close to a third of the estimated 860 million people who sleep on an empty stomach in the world are Indian. And the number is growing.

 The major nutritional problems affecting the country are protein energy malnutrition, Vitamin A deficiency, iron deficiency, and iodine deficiency disorders. The combination of malnutrition and infectious diseases can be pernicious. Protein energy malnutrition can impair the immune system, leaving malnourished children less able to battle common diseases. Vitamin A deficiency prolongs illnesses while iodine deficiency disorder may lead to mental retardation. 

 In the last two decades, researchers have linked a growing number of adult conditions to maternal health. Dietary imbalances at critical periods of development of the womb can trigger an adaptive redistribution of foetal resources. Such adaptations affect foetal structure and metabolism in ways that predispose individuals to cardio-vascular and endocrinal diseases. In an undernourished mother, the foetus protects its brain by directing blood flow from the other organs. The changes in the flow patterns weaken blood vessels and makes individuals more prone to strokes and heart-attacks. The kind of predisposition is not restricted to one person. Indeed, it may be passed for generations in a family. 

 Breaking free

 If the foetus receives only limited nutrients in the womb, its cells may use nutrients sparingly, and the trait becomes ingrained in the growing organism. Undernutrition in the womb leads the foetus to conserve fat and calories. This may place the child at a high risk of obesity during adolescence. Similarly, an undernourished foetus produces fewer insulin-producing cells and heightens the chances of contracting Type-II diabetes. 

 In the poverty-stricken regions of the country, women and children are the primary victims of starvation. Indian women are forced to go on fast very often for the welfare of the other members of the family. Therefore, incidents of child malnutrition are high among deprived sections of the society where mothers have poor nutritional levels.Many mothers in India are forced to watch even as their children waste away and die from starvation.

 The potential gains from the reduction of malnutrition are many. A solution to the problem of chronic hunger can lead to an improvement in intellectual capacity. It also raises the levels of productivity and earnings and reduces healthcare expenditure. The best way to break the vicious cycle of malnutrition is by ensuring feeding programmes for severely malnourished children as well as for pregnant, lactating mothers. The performance of food-based intervention programmes needs to be improved by making them more demand-driven. In order to alleviate the problem of malnutrition, one needs to realize that the conversion efficiency of food intake into energy depends on numerous factors such as access to clean water, healthcare and environmental hygiene.

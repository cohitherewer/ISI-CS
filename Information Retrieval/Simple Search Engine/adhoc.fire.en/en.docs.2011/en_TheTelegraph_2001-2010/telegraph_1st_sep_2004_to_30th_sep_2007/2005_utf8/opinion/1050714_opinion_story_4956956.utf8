 WHY WE NEED TO WALK THE TALK

 Not engaging with the Ulfa now will only strengthen the hands of those who do not want to risk breaking with the past, argues Sanjib Baruah

 There is a pattern in the evolving debate on whether the government should nego-tiate with the United Libe- ration Front of Asom. The Assamese writer, Indira Goswami, has worked for nearly a year to facilitate negotiations. The chief minister, Tarun Gogoi, favours engagement. Much of the Assamese media and many writers and cultural figures are behind Goswamis initiative and Assamese popular sentiments appear to strongly favour engagement.

 A prominent opponent of engagement is Assam?s governor, Ajai Singh ? the architect of two counter-insurgency operations against it. He believes that he could have ?finished? the Ulfa a long time ago, and is unwilling to countenance talking to a group that is militarily weaker today than it was when he commanded troops against it. Whatever one thinks of his position, it is odd in a parliamentary democracy to have an unelected governor ? a retired military general ? locking horns with an elected chief minister on whether negotiations is a better option than force.

 There is a significant new cleavage in today?s Assam: between the ?security haves? and the ?security have-nots?. Those who live in a security bubble ? surrounded everywhere by jeep-loads of armed men ? are not exactly in a position to argue against engagement when their less-privileged compatriots want to give engagement a chance. There is widespread expectation in Assam that engagement could end the insecurity of everyday life ? seen as being the pro-duct both of actions by insurgents and of counter-insurgency operations. While the pro-engagement position is strong in Assam, the anti-engagement position appears to be gaining strength in New Delhi and among its representatives in Assam.

 Of course, a good argument can be made against engagement. Why, for instance, give credibility to the Ulfa?s demand for sovereignty? And isn?t there a danger that engagement will give further legitimacy to violence as a political instrument?

 But in order to bolster its position, the anti-engagement camp has also come up with the choicest of epithets against the Ulfa ? terrorists, criminals, extortionists, ISI agents and so on. But such tirades, that put the pro-engagement camp on the defensive, are misplaced.

 The argument for engaging with the Ulfa is one that Jimmy Carter, a former US president, once made in another context. ?Who would one engage with to stop a conflict or human rights abuse,? he asked, ?if not the people involved in the conflict or perpetrating the human rights violation??

 It is not the character of the Ulfa or the legitimacy of its demands that is at issue. The question is: what is the best way to end the stalemate between the Ulfa and the government? Is it engagement or non-engagement? If the government does not engage with the Ulfa, will the latter simply wither away? Do those who argue against engagement have up their sleeves another viable strategy to end the stalemate?

 Those who are against engagement ignore the logic that sustains low-intensity armed conflicts in north-east India and relies on a selective account of conditions on the ground. The civilian population ? increasingly those in rural rather than in urban areas ? bears the brunt of the continued stalemate. While Goswami is responding to the attendant human misery she sees, Gogoi?s is a response to the political consequences of that misery. After all, even George W. Bush?s men have been forced to secretly talk to Iraqi insurgents after discovering that America?s unparalleled military might is quite useless as a tool to combat insurgency.

 No one should expect that engaging with the Ulfa would be easy. If the Ulfa is willing to come to the negotiation table, it should not be read as a sign of a sudden conversion to the path of non-violence and of an emerging new consensus that its old ways were wrong.

 The internal dynamics of armed groups do not generally favour rushing to moderate positions when faced with a choice between sticking to old ways and change. Even if some people in the Ulfa may be convinced that the old strategy is not working or that the costs imposed by counter-insurgency are very high, the organization may not find it easy to switch gears.

 There are risks involved in moving from the jungle to the negotiating table. Continuing with old positions is a more comfortable position because there is less danger of factional infighting. A swift compromise on foundational issues without trying to get everyone on board can produce rebellions, factionalism and splits.

 Apart from the cadre, the Ulfa leadership also faces the question of explaining a radical shift to its sympathizers, especially to those who have lost loved ones. How will it explain a complete turn-around of goals and strategy to them? Ironically, it is precisely when an armed militant group is weak and considers moderation that the unity of the organization and the authority of prevailing hierarchies become most threatened.

 The Ulfa?s response, reiterating its maximalist position and the demand for the release of ten of its central committee members from prisons in Assam and Bangladesh, therefore, should not come as a surprise. To read it as a sign that the Ulfa lacks the will to negotiate and is trying to regroup may be shortsighted.

 The organization?s de facto leadership probably considers it particularly important now to show to the world that it is not compromising on its basic goals. It does not want to make some of the most important decisions that it has ever made with the majority of the organization?s formal leadership behind bars. That won?t exactly be the best recipe for getting all the factions of the organization behind the negotiations. Short of releasing jailed leaders, there is room for compromise ? such as allowing meetings in prison.

 The process of engaging with the Ulfa will be complex. At this stage, in responding to its statements, the government will be well-advised to take into account the compulsions of the Ulfa?s internal dynamics. Its so-called core demand, that is sovereignty, cannot be seen as the immediate item on the agenda when government negotiators and the Ulfa leadership meet. A more realistic goal in approaching the question of engagement with the Ulfa would be to enable it as an organization to make this shift ? in other words, to strengthen the hands of those in the Ulfa camp who might favour moderation. Not engaging with the Ulfa now will only strengthen the hands of those who may not want to risk breaking with the past.

 Responding creatively to the Ulfa?s moves might require diplomatic skills that appear to be in short supply in the home ministry, where most important decisions on the North-east are made.

 Even in our imperfect democracy, it is possible to make decisions that respect the wishes of the people most affected by this conflict ? those bearing the brunt of the insecurity of everyday life that has characterized Assam for the past quarter century. We must do all that it takes to put a sustainable peace process in place.

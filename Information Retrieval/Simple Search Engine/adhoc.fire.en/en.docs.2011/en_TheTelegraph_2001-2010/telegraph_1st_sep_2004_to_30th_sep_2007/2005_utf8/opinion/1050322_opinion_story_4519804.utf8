 UNDER EASTERN EYES

 Malvika Singh

 Condi Rice. She was in Delhi last week telling India, in true condescending style, that this country could possibly play an international role along with other developed countries, in the near future, that we have been ?accepted? as a nation that can deliver the goods in an organized fashion. Obviously this change of attitude stems from the fact that we handled the tsunami onslaught as well as if not better than most, did not go about with a ?begging? bowl and gave the US short shrift, something they have not been used to in the recent past. It has become nauseating to hear the US leaders rattle on superciliously.

 They behave as badly as the ?imperialists? did in the early part of the last century. They feel threatened by the Iran, Pakistan, India pipeline, it throws them out of gear and reduces them to an inconsequential position. It terrifies them that their stranglehold may ease and new players in the region may emerge. They cannot bar the distant possibility of India, China and Russia coming together. It is laughable that countries other than theirs cannot have nuclear capacity, it is laughable. The US has the largest arsenal of weapons of mass destruction. It remains the most dangerous nation on this planet.

 The US represents the most frightening avatar of an Imperial Power. Its record of intrusion into sovereign countries because of serious cultural, social and political differences, is scary. Its need for monopoly is unacceptable. Its overriding sense of insecurity, veiled by supreme arrogance, powered by economic wealth, defines this beginning-to-wither state.

 Super error

 If SAARC countries depended on each other and worked closely to deny the US entry into their realms, it would begin to shake off the cocky strut of this ?super power? that has always triggered off friction between India and Pakistan to keep the two from coming together. It would defy the US foreign policy, the hidden agenda, if Indo-Pak relations suddenly improved radically. Where would this conquering nation state move on to? Its primitive mindset would have to undergo an overhaul. We must cease to fall into the traps they set. We must not be greedy. We must refrain from becoming a satellite of the US. The future lies in this region, which is why they are here. We must not hand ourselves to them on a platter by falling to their many baits.

 Then, they refuse Narendra Modi a visa. This, because of his ?human rights? record. What about Guantanamo Bay? What about the atrocities conducted on Iraqis? What about Afghanistan? Hypocrisy of the worst kind because the US believes that ?acceptability? of anything can only be on its terms. I have always felt that grovelling at the feet of the US has been unsavoury. It was the US state department that was very favourable to the BJP against the Congress because the Congress always kept the US at the periphery. Over the last seven years, the US had begun to intrude on and permeate the Indian political scene. It thought the NDA was there to stay. Now it has had to shift gears. Does the US believe that its favoured political dispensation, the BJP, is not going to be in power for some time and so it must somersault? Maybe the US needs some intellectual training about this country. We are not fickle.

 And finally, the prime minister has become the patron saint of the tiger in India. He has emphatically stated that he will tolerate no slippages in the area of administering forests and the environment. The men in the ministry who tried to ?cover up? by proclaiming that NGOs were overreacting should scurry for cover and right their overriding wrongs and work as per rules that determine their ?code of conduct?. To relay the truth is imperative and any administrator who tries to mislead should be led out and away.

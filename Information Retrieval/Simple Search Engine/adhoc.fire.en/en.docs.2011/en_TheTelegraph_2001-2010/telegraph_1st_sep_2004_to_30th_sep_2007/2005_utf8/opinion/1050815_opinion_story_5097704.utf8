 Letters to Editor

 Something in the air

 Sir ? The irresponsible attitude of the state government towards air pollution in Calcutta is just incredible (?Govt dumps clean-air date, again?, Aug 9). For how long will the government drag its feet? Until some foreign investor with deep pockets finds it uncomfortable to breathe in Calcutta? I guess not, because they don?t take the bus or auto-rickshaw. They drive into their AC rooms directly from the airport, in their AC cars over the new flyovers. How about a court ruling making it mandatory for the transport minister and the chief minister to breathe the foul air in the city by pulling the shutters of their cars down when they travel in the city? Or even better, make it mandatory for the duo to take auto-rickshaws to office every day, sitting directly across the exhaust pipe of a bus. I can guarantee that this alone will make sure that the deadline is met before the pujas.

 Yours faithfully,

Gautam Basu, Calcutta

 Unfair play

 Sir ? The United Progressive Alliance had, in its common minimum programme, promised to reserve one-third seats for women in parliament. It is more than a year since the UPA came to office, but the government continues to put off fulfilling its commitment. It has now come up with a proposal to raise the number of seats in parliament to accommodate women. This is ridiculous. The women?s reservation bill was first tabled in 1996, and every government since then has connived in not passing it. The present government too is no different from others in this regard. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kishore Kumar Soma, Hyderabad

 Sir ? If the additional seats in parliament will be for women, does it mean that the government believes that the existing seats are only for men? Instead of pandering to such harebrained ideas, the objections of the Samajwadi Party and the Rashtriya Janata Dal to the bill should be overruled and the bill passed in its original form. Or, there might be demands to adopt the same principle for all legislative bodies. With the increase in the number of members, the time each one gets to speak will go down and the expenditure on house-sessions will go up drastically.

 Yours faithfully,

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? According to the Manusamhita, man and woman were created from two equal divisions of Brahma?s body. Thus, men and women are equal and have equal rights. Then why should only 33 per cent seats be reserved for women? The male to female ratio found in nature is one is to one. So each constituency should have two representatives, one male and the other female. This system should prevail everywhere, from panchayats to the parliament. 

 Yours faithfully,

Hara Lal Chakraborty, Calcutta

 Sir ? One can be sure that the extra seats that the UPA proposes to add to accommodate women in parliament too will be filled up by the unsavoury politicians that our parties seem to be full of. And that will not be in the national interest. If a woman is good enough to be in parliament, she?ll make it on her own. Reservations, at the cost of able members, is not desirable and can only lead to disaster. 

 Yours faithfully,

Mahesh Kumar, New Delhi

 Sir ? It?s clear that male Indian politicians (except, perhaps, the communists) won?t allow the women?s reservation bill to be passed in parliament at any cost. Carving out 258 additional parliamentary constituencies will be a tall order. At any rate, ?increasing the size of parliament will lead to a lot of problems? as the CPI(M)?s Nilotpal Basu rightly said. Already, the Samajwadi Party, the RJD and the Bahujan Samaj Party have complicated matters by demanding reservations for the minorities, scheduled castes and tribes. It is clear that all these parties are conniving to postpone or discard the women?s reservation bill forever.

 Yours faithfully,

J.B. Singh, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? Parliamentarians are for the people; the people are not for the parliamentarians. Women must be given one-third of the existing seats by passing the bill in its original form. It is senseless to burden the nation with more legislators. Let parliament remain a debating forum, instead of turning it into a mob. 

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Parting shot

 Sir ? Samit Basu talks about ?A planet called Xena? (Aug 7), while describing the newly found planet 2003 UB313. But Xena was merely the internal codeword among members of the team which discovered it. They codenamed the recently discovered Kuiper Belt object 2003 EL61 ?Santa? because it was discovered shortly after Christmas. The new planet will be named by the International Astronomical Union, whose guidelines dictate that it must be named after a deity in some pantheon.

 Yours faithfully,

Robert Waters, Des Moines, US

 Letters to Editor

 All in the mind

 Sir ? Sumanta Sen may have his suspicions (?A lot of huffing and puffing?, June 23), but let us assume that the Union health minister is right in his assumption that the display of smoking on the silver screen has an effect on impressionable minds and thereby on their physical well-being. And that A. Ramadoss is more sincere about his commitment to the health of the country than to being in the league of cancer-fighting nations. But what about the mental health of teenagers who are exposed to heavy doses of violence and sex in the same media? I am sure that the 14-year-old, who took recourse to murder when he couldn?t resolve his sexual infatuation, was influenced by the abundance of violence on the screen (?Crush drives boy to kill?, June 21). Let us hope that the censors in this country feel as responsible as India?s health minister.

 Yours faithfully,

 C.V.K. Moorthy, Calcutta

 Campus watch

 Sir ? An ?agitation? is not necessarily a great thing. The slogans of the striking students of Jadavpur University are full of rhetoric and lack substance. Some students, after qualifying in the entrance examination, believe that they do not need to study any further, they can fail exams as many times they like and it is their right to pass out of the university at the right time, even if it means sitting for endless supplementary exams. This is the sort of sentiment that fuelled the whole crisis. Refusal by the authorities to allow such indiscipline led to a scuffle with the controller and faculty, and finally the hunger strike. Unfortunately, no one had the foresight to record the previous incident on video. Should unruly behaviour by students with impossible demands be encouraged? What message does this convey to present and future students? Many people believe that since admission to JU requires high marks and a joint entrance examination score, these students can do no wrong. It has recently been my sad experience to find students cheating in exams, forging teachers? signature and so on. Of course, most of the students are indeed very good and are a joy to teach. But JU should not bring itself to shame because of a handful of erring students. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sujata Tarafdar, Calcutta

 Sir ? As an alumnus of Jadavpur University, I was shocked to hear of the vicious police assault on unarmed students. Perhaps even more shocking were the persistent and arrogant ?explanations? given by the university authorities and the West Bengal government to justify the police brutality on a democratic protest. What is most alarming is that this violence is being justified by some in the government by their frequent references to their own pasts as student leaders. As an academic, I understand how hard it must be for these courageous young men and women to come out onto the streets risking their own careers. But one hopes that the students stay on the streets till they win their demands.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? In an academic institution, the primary concern of the students should be their studies. They must remember that they are there to ensure a secure future. Protests, like the one at JU, can affect academic activities severely. But the authorities must have thought twice before calling in the police. Manhandling by the police can cause irreparable damage to students? psyche. It is the duty of the authorities to pay attention to students? demands. Otherwise, some bright minds may be wasted.

 Yours faithfully,

Dipro Ray, Calcutta

 Sir ? ?Campus accord on early solution? (June 23) suggests that a truce might be in the offing. To hasten matters, agitating students should apologize for their action and the authorities should withdraw their suspension orders. I still wonder how it was possible for the brutally ?battered? and ?bruised? students to appear in front of cameras and give interviews the next day. Actually, the whole thing was acted out by a handful of students who tried to get sympathy for the suspended students.

 Yours faithfully,

Kaustav Maity, Calcutta

 Sir ? The purpose of education is to create hardworking, disciplined professionals and responsible citizens. To that extent, the current faculty and administration of JU have failed miserably. In the recent past, while interviewing a few technical graduates from JU for recruitment, I was taken aback by their hostility towards some faculty members, who, according to them, are more interested in their personal benefits rather than teaching. When students find greed, corruption and indiscipline among their teachers, it is natural for them to get disillusioned. 

 Yours faithfully,

Prabal Kanti Choudhury, Toronto 

 Sir ? The students? struggle might end on a happy note. But what after all this is over and life comes back to ?normal? in the campus? Will we forget the incident and wait for another clash to realize that the teacher-student relationship has to be worked out on a more solid basis? 

 Yours faithfully,

Sona Mallick, Calcutta

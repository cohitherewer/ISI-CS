 JUST CRICKET

 Hemming and hawing takes a while. So the president of Pakistan, Mr Pervez Musharraf, will reportedly be watching the last one-day match during the Pakistan cricket team?s tour of India, in Delhi on April 17. Although the test in Calcutta that is now on, or the first one-day match in Kochi, to be held on April 2, were also considered excellent occasions for the president?s visit, the preliminaries have stretched out for far too long. It all goes back to the hemming and hawing in the South Block at the beginning, when it was first reported that Mr Musharraf had publicly expressed a desire to watch one of the matches ? but only if he were invited. It was beautifully accomplished on the president?s side: he loves sports and a Pakistan-India match would be just the thing, but he also needs an invitation ? no harm in casually mentioning to newspersons what is a personal wish after all. To sit on this very broad hint for five days, as the Indian diplomatic establishment did, appearing quite uncertain what to do, was to play right into the Pakistan president?s hands. Once the prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, issued the invitation, the system creaked into action, but not before the wise heads in the foreign ministry had lost a few hairs.

 The invitation to the Pakistan president was inevitable as soon as Mr Musharraf had expressed his wish. The hosts would have come across as deft and smooth had his hint been taken up immediately and warmly. The sporting mood would have been equally visible on both sides. All other considerations pertaining to the visit ? of perceptions and realities, of possibilities and impossibilities ? that weighed on the ministry, would have had to be handled after the generous and warm spirit of a large nation had been adequately displayed. Cricket diplomacy could be put to more uses than one. Mr Musharraf has a gift for seizing the moment. The release of floods of warmth from people on both sides of the border is only one aspect of the many-sided situation that Mr Musharraf is constantly trying to manage nationally and internationally. The president needs to turn every opportunity to advantage in negotiating this thin ice, and this includes making visiting left leaders happy. But canny charm can only be bested by cannier charm. It is to be hoped that the South Block will not make its hesitations so obvious next time.

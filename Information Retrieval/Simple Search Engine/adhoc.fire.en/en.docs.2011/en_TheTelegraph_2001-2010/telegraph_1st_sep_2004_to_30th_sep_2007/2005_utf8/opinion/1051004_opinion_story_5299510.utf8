 Power moves

 Sir ? The left?s criticism of India?s vote at the Vienna meet of the International Atomic Energy Agency shows that it places Iran?s interest over India?s (?Left sees red, govt rebuts?, Sept 25). The Bharatiya Janata Party?s objection to the alleged ?secrecy? in voting may well be ignored since it takes its role in the opposition a bit too seriously. Besides, it has already done a U-turn on the policies it followed in the recent past. 

 It is amply clear that Iran is more interested in its nuclear weapons programme than in nuclear energy. But a nuclear-powered Iran cannot be to India?s best interests. Supporting a theocracy in the name of non-alignment, and killing India?s own nuclear deal in the process would have been a foolish move. India has acted commendably by not backing plans of the United States of America to refer Iran to the United National security council. At the same time, the government has made it clear that India?s relations with the Islamic countries are also of huge significance. India has achieved the right balance as sitting on the fence was no longer possible.

 Yours faithfully,

Pranav Sachdeva, New Delhi

 Sir ? There is a serious complacency in the Manmohan Singh regime over the fallout of India?s betrayal of Iran on the nuclear issue. The glib talk about the India-Iran gas project not being affected is not convincing, despite Iran?s admission that it will not judge an ?old friend? on the basis of a single incident. Is India trying to wriggle out of the deal through the backdoor by any chance? One saw how Manmohan Singh had started talking about ?uncertainties? in Iran earlier after a visit to the US, only to back down after protests from every quarter. 

 Quite apart from the value of the pipeline project, there is a case for morality here. The non-proliferation treaty, of which Iran is a signatory, allows it to have uranium-enriching facilities, and no IAEA inspector has ever found Iran in breach of any regulation. But this is anathema to Washington. Does anyone remember that the US had travelled the same route over Iraq? And that the US could well attack Iran to divert attention from its impending defeat in Iraq? Will Delhi allow itself to be compromised by a new set of American lies?

 Yours faithfully,

Biswapriya Purkayastha,

 Sir ? The India vote in favour of the US-backed resolution at the IAEA meet, marks a new beginning in the foreign policy of the fourth largest economy of the world. It is of considerable importance that major non-Nato allies like Pakistan, as well as major developing countries such as China, Brazil and Russia abstained from the vote. In publicly released statements, officials from these countries have made clear their apprehensions on some of the points of the resolution. As a traditional non-aligned, pro-Iran country, India had all the reasons to follow their lead. However, in a brave departure from an erstwhile moribund policy, India has declared that by its own independent inquiry, it feels that Iran needs to do more in order to comply with the IAEA?s regulations. 

 In any case, siding with the US gives a boost to the recently signed nuclear deal, and might facilitate Indo-US cooperation in the energy field. The leftists in India are naturally unhappy about this. But the fact is that Manmohan Singh?s India has finally accepted that it has more to gain by siding with the US than by being against it. 

 Yours faithfully,

Aruni Mukherjee, Coventry, UK

 Sir ? The editorial, ?Waltz in Vienna? (Sept 30) does a good job of obfuscating the truth by resorting to high-sounding rhetoric. The second last sentence, ?The harvest lies in Washington,? reveals what the editorial has tried to hide ? that Manmohan Singh has sold out to George W. Bush for the ?Next Step in Strategic Partnership? carrot. Singh has no hands-on experience in international relations and hence is totally out of his depth in the parry and thrust of realpolitik. Being docile and submissive by nature, he took the easy way out in Vienna by backing the IAEA resolution against Iran. But a more important matter of concern is, what precisely did Singh sell out during his July trip to the US? Did he acquiesce to the US-sponsored monitoring of our nuclear facilities? 

 There is a nagging suspicion that he has. The left?s circumspection is well-founded. There is genuine concern over the fact that Bush may be planning to do an Iraq in Iran, this time with India?s backing. Incidentally, did Iran react in such a shameful manner when India weaponized? 

 Yours faithfully,

J.K. Dutt, Calcutta

 Sir ? India?s sudden volte face on Iran exposes the double standards of the United Progressive Alliance, which had earlier alleged the National Democratic Alliance of selling out to the US. The vote is flawed primarily on four counts. First, it is against the economic interests of our country as Iran is an energy-rich nation and close to the future oil and gas reserves ? the Caspian region. It also has the potential to jeopardize the much-hyped Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline. Second, India has deviated from its traditional stand of being a ?non-aligned? nation. The strong economic ties with Iran made Russia and China abstain from the vote. By voting against Iran, India has lost the chance to put forth a united ?third-world interest? at global fora. 

 Third, most of the first-world countries including the US and EU have summarily rejected India?s campaign to get a permanent seat at the UN security council. India could have earned Iran?s vote on the matter rather easily. Fourth, the EU-backed resolution is not clear as to what action the security council should take eventually. The US may try to use this resolution to impose sanctions against Iran. 

 The move also belies India?s stand that every country should have the right to pursue its own energy policy, nuclear or otherwise, taking into consideration the larger energy security in mind in an era of spiralling petroleum prices and diminishing oil reserves. According to a famous diplomat, ?a country has no permanent enemies or friends, but only permanent interests.? And India has clearly compromised its own.

 Yours faithfully,

Saif Khalid, New Delhi

 Sir ? Now that India has so willingly acquiesced to the US diktat on Iran, will it also reconsider and give in to US demands to send troops to Iraq? That scenario seems entirely possible now. If South Africa, China, Russia, Brazil, Mexico and other nations could abstain from the vote, what forced India to specify its stand? 

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh,Jamshedpur

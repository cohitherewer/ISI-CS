 THE GAME PANDAVAS PLAYED

Cricket in India: Origin and Heroes

By Raju Mukherji, 

UBSPD, Rs 245

Most top class cricket players make awful cricket 

writers. What is equally true is the fact that most top class cricket writers 

have very little interest in the history of the game. There are exceptions. The 

names of Bradman, Constantine and Miller come easily to mind. There are others 

too, but one will be hard put to find an Indian on that list. Pataudi could have 

made it, but he is too lazy to exert himself.

 Raju Mukherji played cricket just below the highest level. He was a powerful batsman with fluent drives on both sides of the wicket. Since the time he was in school, he has been passionate about cricket. But this passion blossomed once he retired from first class cricket and took to writing about the game. He brings to his writings a keen sense of the history of the game and also of its technical aspects which often escape the average lover of the game. His writing is always lucid and knowledgeable.

 This book brings together a number of essays. One essay which serves as an introduction is about the origins of cricket. And the rest are about eminent Indian players. Mukherji?s arguments about the origins of cricket are novel and are certain to raise more than a few eyebrows. He seems to agree with Ashish Nandy that cricket is an Indian game that the British discovered. To back his claims, Mukherji draws on an episode in the Mahabharata. It centres around a spherical object with which the young Kauravas and Pandavas were playing. Mukherji holds that this was the original cricket ball. He also suggests that danda guli was an early form from which cricket was derived. These arguments are tenuous. One does not know the antiquity of danda guli. It might have been the poor man?s attempt to play cricket in his own way.

 The section on individual cricketers is entitled ?Heroes?. Mukherji notes that ?the selection was restricted only to those players who, I felt, contributed the most to the ethos of modern Indian cricket?. This restriction does not allow him to write on someone like Ambar Roy whose cricket Mukherji knew very intimately. There is nothing very remarkable about the selection save the inclusion of Rusi Surti, now a forgotten name. Mukherji notes what an outstanding fighter and fielder he was. Mukherji is particularly good on Pataudi who he successfully situates in the context of Indian cricket and then evaluates the contribution he made. He is also good on Jaisimha who obviously leads his list of heroes. His analysis of the adjustments that Mohinder Amarnath made to improve his technique against fast bowling is also acute.

 I for one would have preferred Mukherji to have been more anecdotal. Those who know him know that he has a fund of stories which he has picked up from the circuit. He provides statistics but I believe that numbers are irrelevant to understand heroes.

 Mukherji obviously has a bigger book on Indian cricket inside him. Maybe a history of the Eden Gardens? He should sit down and write it before some charlatan occupies the space.

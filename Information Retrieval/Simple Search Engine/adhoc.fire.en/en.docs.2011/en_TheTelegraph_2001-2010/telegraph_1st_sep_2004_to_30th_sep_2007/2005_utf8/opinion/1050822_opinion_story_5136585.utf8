 CALLING ALL INVESTORS, BUT PLEASE MIND THE GAP

 However hard Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee may try wooing capital into his state, a section of his party is still undermining his efforts by alleging injustice to farmers, writes Ashis Chakrabarti

 If things work out as planned, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s journey to the east ? to Singapore and Indonesia ? should turn out to be a great moment of hope for Bengal. The trip is expected to yield very large investments in the state. No one in the government is willing to hazard a guess about the actual amount. But it is generally agreed that it will be a lot more than the largest foreign direct investment in the state so far ? of Rs 1,475 crore in Mitsubishi Chemicals project at Haldia. Some have suggested that the projected investments by the Salim Group of Indonesia could be second only to the Rs 51 crore project that the South Korean firm, Posco, is about to start in Orissa. The Posco investment is the biggest ever FDI in the country. 

 Instead of sharing the chief minister?s dream, though, many in his own Communist Party of India (Marxist) have gone into a sulk. They see a threat to the party?s pro-poor land reforms in his enthusiasm for new industries and global capital. The investors need land on which to set up their ventures and that would mean displacement of peasants from their land. How can a leftist government do this, the critics ask. Such scepticism, especially from the ruling party, with its large rural base, can slow down Bengal?s economic recovery, even if it does not actually throw it off-course. 

 That Bhattacharjee has managed to get the support of most of his senior party colleagues on the issue should comfort him as he embarks on his journey. He knows that there still is a section of the party which remains unconvinced. He also knows that the use of farm land for industrial or urbanization projects and the resultant alienation of farmers have their political risks. 

 Unlike the leaders in China, where this has been happening on a large scale, Bhattacharjee and his party have to fight democratic elections. And the debate over the commercial ? and non-agricultural ? use of land has begun at a time when the next assembly polls in the state are less than a year away. For all the encomia that are now showered on Bhattacharjee?s reformist zeal, he knows that the party must remain his principal strength. And the party cannot afford to do anything that would lose it the support of the rural masses. After all, the gains of upper-class support due to reformist policies are limited in electoral terms. 

 So, are his critics right in their objections? The ground reality in Bengal?s villages would suggest that they could not be more wrong. 

 It is true that the Left Front government?s land reform programmes did much to improve both agriculture and the economic conditions of peasants in addition to ensuring their rights to the land. Farm productivity increased and it gave the state the food security that makes starvation deaths in the villages stray, rather than common, occurrences. 

 But that is yesterday?s story. What one encounters in the villages today speaks of a decline. Even farmers no longer consider agriculture ? at least the traditional type ? an economically viable occupation. A farmer?s family can barely make a living from land. Not only are the costs of farming too high for them to bear, but also the returns from it are too low. There is very little of marketing support to enable them to sell their produce at remunerative prices. 

 The result is a slow reversal of the left?s land reforms gains. Farmers are moving away from land, but not always to any other specific vocation. Worse, this is happening more to small and marginal farmers than to people owning larger plots of land. Since the land ceiling laws make it illegal for a person to own ceiling-surplus land, more affluent farmers are buying up plots of small farmers and keeping them as ?benami? holdings. This was the rural racket that the left?s land reforms once busted. Now, it is back with a vengeance. 

 As small and marginal farmers are forced to sell off their plots, they become landless labourers once again. But they cannot hope to earn enough as daily wages, as landowners take advantage of their helplessness and force them to work for much less than the statutory minimum wage. 

 Although the left forced the United Progressive Alliance government?s hands to fix Rs 60 as the daily wage under the national employment guarantee scheme, it would be a rare Bengal village where farm labour now gets this amount for his day?s work. Even in the state?s agricultural heartland of Burdwan, the daily wage varies between Rs 40 and Rs 50. 

 All this should be no revelation to the CPI(M) leaders. As the party of the rural poor, whose peasant wing in Bengal has more than 10 million members, it knows all about the current state of the peasantry. In fact, two documents show that the party is worried about the stagnation that has gripped agriculture. One is the all-important policy paper presented by the party?s senior peasant leader, Benoy Konar, at the state council of Paschim Banga Pradeshik Krishak Sabha in July, 2002. The other is the new agriculture policy announced by the Bhattacharjee government the next year. 

 Both documents cry out for a change in agriculture and highlight the importance of transforming it into modern-day commerce with the infusion of private capital. There may have been differences over the wisdom of introducing ?contract? and ?captive? farming in Bengal. But the main thrust was on the need for private, capitalistic enterpreneurship in farming. 

 Both documents cleared the road for the entry of even multi-national firms into agriculture. An emphasis was placed on the need for the development of big farm-based industries. There was a rider, though, in Konar?s paper, which was discussed and accepted by the Krishak Sabha. The allotment of land to big private firms would depend on the kind of enterprise they wanted to set up. 

 So, why this noise in the party over allotting land to the Salim Group, which wants to set up a special economic zone, along with a health city and a satellite township, in South 24 Parganas? If an entrepreneur chooses to invest in projects other than agricultural, will the government say no to them? No such noise was heard when the government acquired land for the new industries in Haldia or Bankura or for the township at Rajarhat. 

 There was little opposition to the proposals to set up new township projects in west Howrah, in which too the Salim Group is to be involved, or at Dankuni. Even a new road would require acquisition of agricultural land by the government. Bhattacharjee?s critics in the party would probably argue that they have no problem with the government acquiring land. Their objection relates to the transfer of peasants? land to private entrepreneurs. 

 Contrary to the populist nature of their argument, it could actually be a very reactionary stand. Given the decline of agriculture, it makes little economic sense not to free land for commercial and other economically viable ventures. In other words, it is a very backward idea to forcibly bind farmers to unprofitable agriculture, as if they do not need the reforms and the upward mobility that can come with them. Marx would not have approved of a policy that prevents farmers from graduating to an urban, industrial society.

 MOST UNNECESSARY

 Beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder. But can indecency also be left to the same yardstick of personal preference? The police in Chennai, and if reports are to be believed then large sections of the people who live in the city, seem to think otherwise. The bar licence of a hotel in Chennai has been revoked for 90 days because couples were photographed kissing in a nightclub on the hotel premises. The moral outrage that has been articulated because young people were kissing is as frightening as it is revealing of the prevailing double standards. But that apart, there are other issues involved also. One is the definition of what is public and private, something that is always a little hazy. Kissing in the nightclub of a hotel is not as public as, say, necking in a park, in the cinema or in a taxi. There has been a suggestion that the incident actually took place during a private celebration for which the nightclub was a venue. There is no evidence that the people present in the nightclub actually objected to kissing, the outcry came only when the photographs were published. In other words, the objections came from those who were not present in the nightclub. It is possible that frequenters of nightclubs in Chennai have different standards of morality from the rest of Chennai society. Also, it is not known if any action has been taken against the young people who were captured in the photograph, but the hotel has been made the target. In this sense also the action of the police is exaggerated and questionable.

 The police in Chennai have set themselves up as guardians of morals rather than preservers of the city?s law and order. It is debatable if kissing in a nightclub (or anywhere for that matter) is an indecent act. In India, the line separating the decent from the indecent is not only blurred but also shifted arbitrarily. Many things that are vulgar are allowed in public and there is a strange taboo against kissing. There is no explanation for this save to see it as a knee-jerk reaction against something that is seen as an import from Western cultures. But even in the context of this bizarre prejudice, the actions of the Chennai police appear heavy and highhanded. They have come out in full moral force against what was nothing more than a little bit of enjoyment, perhaps reckless, on the part of a few youngsters. Kissing is surely not something that can get anyone hot under the collar.

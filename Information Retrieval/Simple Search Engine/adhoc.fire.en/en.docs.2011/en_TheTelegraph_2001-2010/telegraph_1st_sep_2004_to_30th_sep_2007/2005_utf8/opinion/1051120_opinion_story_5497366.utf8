 Letters to Editor

 Much ado about suffering

 Sir ? Whatever one may blame Natwar Singh for, preventing India from co-sponsoring the anti-Holocaust resolution at the UN should not be one of them (?Natwar hands India Nazi taint?, Nov 16). Most of us know that the number of Jews murdered during the Holocaust was exceeded by the number of non-Jewish (communist, social democrat, Russian, gypsy, or just anti-Nazi) inmates similarly murdered. Yet, US-sponsored propaganda has led the world to think that only Jews were Nazism?s victims. Israel has used this to the hilt. Jews do not have a monopoly over victimhood and suffering, and Indians should be proud to stand by those countries which have the courage to point this out. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Biswapriya Purkayastha, Shillong

 Good life, or bad?

 Sir ? Ashok V. Desai?s ?Outsourcing your life? (Nov 15) will go a long way in clearing doubts about the work culture of BPOs. For outsiders, the working hours of BPOs may seem a bit erratic, but it is hardly the only profession which demands work at night. In railways, police, hospitals and in the entertainment industry, employees are quite used to working at night and at odd hours. 

 BPO companies invest sufficiently on the training of their employees. Companies such as IBM, Wipro, Infosys have revolutionized the field. Most of them maintain strict eight-hour schedules. Workers, in return, are handsomely rewarded, leaving little room for resentment. Besides free pick-up and drop, workers also have perquisites, such as recreational facilities, state-of-the-art gymnasiums and so on. After all this, is it asking too much if the companies expect their employees to work diligently?

 Yours faithfully,

Amit V. Sengupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? Ashok Mitra may be correct in describing BPO recruits as international scabs, but the contribution of BPOs in the employment sector should be acknowledged (?Slave, scab, pipedream?, Nov 11). The BPO market is projected to be worth around one trillion dollars by 2006. India has been a dominant player in the offshore BPO market so far with a share of 80 per cent. In its recent report, the international research firm, Gartner, has predicted that India?s market share would come down to 55 per cent by 2007. But the business will increase in absolute terms. According to Gartner, global offshore BPO spending will grow to $ 24.2 billion by 2007, of which India will account for $ 13.8 billion. 

 India could lose out due to its single-minded focus on the English language, as it does not have a significant pool of workers who speak non-English foreign languages such as Spanish, French, or German. With the offshore BPO market growing, and the United Kingdom and other European countries offshoring their work, the share of non-English work is set to rise in future. This could prove to be a hindrance for Indian companies as business may be snatched away by nations with better foreign-language skills. Further, in order to retain business, Indian BPO companies should diversify into other countries and set up shop there to reap the advantage.

 Yours faithfully,

Masood Md Sohail, Calcutta

 Sir ? For the educated urban youth of the country, call centres and BPOs are a beacon of hope. At call centres, individuals with only higher secondary certificates or those above 30 are not treated as untouchables. Yes, BPOs are known to exploit their employees by demanding work at erratic hours, but the employees also receive handsome remuneration. If BPOs are really such ghastly employers, why do young men and women flock to their interviews? If BPO work is ?slavery?, then many aspire to be prosperous slaves.

 Yours faithfully,

Kajal Chatterjee, Calcutta

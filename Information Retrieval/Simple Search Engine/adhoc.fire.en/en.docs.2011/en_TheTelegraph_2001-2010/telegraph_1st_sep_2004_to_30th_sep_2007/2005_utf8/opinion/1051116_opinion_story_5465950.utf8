 DEFY THE HERD INSTINCT

 The fact that the political choice of Muslims is largely guided by a sense of fear is bad for the social health of India, writes Sumanta Sen

 Spare a thought

 Any discussion on electoral politics in this country invariably brings up the question of how Muslims will vote. One heard this in connection with the elections in Bihar, and will surely hear more on the subject when West Bengal and several other states go to the polls next year. The general feeling seems to be that Muslims vote almost en bloc as a religious community, not allowing their experience of daily life to influence them; that their only concern is to elect people who will allow them to live in peace with their religious identity.

 A minority community in a country which has not always been known for a uniform level of religious tolerance, can always feel insecure. The sense of insecurity is not just at the physical level ? Muslims in India do not always feel that they are in actual danger of being attacked. But there can be other reasons for feeling insecure. They can, and often do, feel that they are neglected, that the future holds out pretty little in the land they live in. While that is understandable, the question that needs to be asked is, do Muslims, as a rule, allow such a sense of insecurity to influence their political choice? Also, does this happen everywhere in the country?

 That does not seem to be the case always. Take West Bengal, for instance. Here, there are two types of Muslims ? the ones who are Bengalis and the others who speak Urdu or Hindi. Very often the linguistic difference is seen to be reflected in their pattern of voting as well. In the past, it has often been noted that while Muslims living in the waterfront areas of Calcutta or Park Circus (who do not speak Bengali) have opted for the Congress, or later the Trinamool Congress, their co-religionists elsewhere in the city have voted left. But that too not uniformly. 

 Bengali Muslims in Howrah, Hooghly or the two 24-Parganas may vote for the left in a much bigger manner than those in Malda or Murshidabad. The reason for this does seem to boil down to political organization or, as leftists generally argue, to the varying levels of consciousness at different places. Muslims living in Malda and Murshidabad, industrially backward both, are seen to be more conservative than, say, those living along the two banks of the Ganga near Calcutta. There can be many other reasons too, but the fact remains that in West Bengal, Muslims very rarely vote as a single entity. Also, Bengali Muslims are never known to act according to any pre-election fatwa, which, of course, does not make them any less devoted to Islam than the others.

 In Assam, too, one has noted this difference. The ethnic Assamese Muslims seem to have little interest in those who speak Bengali, perhaps because the forefathers of the latter had come from districts which are now in Bangladesh. And so, in the long prevailing atmosphere of the state, they are all considered ?foreigners?. The minorities? front in the state is solely concerned about the plight of the Bengali-speaking Muslims. Contrary to popular belief, Islam is not a binding force here. In Assam, the sense of physical insecurity can be seen in only a section of the religious minorities, and this guides their political choice. If an Assamese Muslim votes the same way as a Bengali Muslim, it will be for entirely different reasons. There is no single vote bank here also.

 Such a vote bank did seem to exist in Uttar Pradesh, with Mulayam Singh Yadav being described as Maulana Mulayam. That bank got consolidated after the firm measures ? including firing ? that he took against kar sevaks at Ayodhaya during his first stint as chief minister in the Eighties. The later demolition of the Babri mosque, when the Bharatiya Janata Party was in office, caused Muslims to flock to his banner in larger numbers. But the emergence of the Bahujan Samaj Party caused a breach in this loyalty as sections of the backward Muslims thought it more profitable to opt for Mayavati. Here also, there is a sense of insecurity, but those suffering from this do not appear to be going for a single saviour, and thereby do not behave in a uniform manner. In the days to come, no psephologist will be at ease with the ?Muslim vote? in UP. With the Congress trying to re-emerge in the state, the next election may well see the Muslim vote getting split in three ways, provided, of course, the three parties fight on their own.

 In Bihar, on the other hand, for the last fifteen years, the community has voted almost en bloc for Laloo Yadav for the way in which he has been able to keep communal politics at bay. There is a definite ?vote bank? here, and it is doubtful to what extent Ram Vilas Paswan has been able to cut into it, though with his Dalit brand of politics, he is hoping to rope in backward Muslims in the manner of the BSP in neighbouring UP.

 Actually, the Bihar results will be interesting in the context of the subject under discussion. Communalism has never been that big an issue in Bihar, even if one were to take into account the Bhagalpur riots. But Laloo Prasad Yadav has cleverly kept the memory of that riot fresh and, at the same time, repeated his promises for a fair deal for the impoverished. It has to be seen if Muslims have at last seen through the game and allowed the issue of religious identity to take the backseat while making their choice.

 Of the states to hold assembly elections next year is Kerala, perhaps the only Indian state where the Muslim vote is always predictable. One reason could be the fact that Kerala is the only state where Muslims have a political party of their own, carrying the words Muslim League. Here also, it is a question of identity preservation ? identity not so much religious as political, or religion-based politics. Many years ago, E.M.S. Namboodiripad had sought to give a different interpretation but his party had shot it down as it did sound a bit opportunistic. The fact remains that in Kerala, Muslims and Christians vote almost en bloc and in the same direction.

 Religious communities voting in one single manner may be useful for pollsters but perhaps not so good for the nation?s social health. It makes them stand separately, which secularists should not like. Unfortunately, secularists like the ones in Bihar and UP seem to favour this as they are not too sure what shape their assimilation with the majority community would take. So it is a kind of ?minority communalism? that they indulge in. The existence of a definite Muslim vote helps them.

 Thus, generally speaking, except in West Bengal, the Muslim choice is largely guided by a sense of fear, though in making that choice at places they go for more than one box. But the existence of that feeling is in itself a danger for society as a whole. It is not what one expects in a secular republic.

 ROOTS TO RICHES

 Nobody is quite ready to go all the way. But the right sort of gestures have to be made. This, more or less, is the official Indian attitude to dual citizenship. It is a combination of slightly forced liberalism, instinctively nationalistic fears and mildly confused thinking, packaged in the rhetoric of openness and globalizaton. There is also, of course, the need to keep rich NRIs happy and interested, so that the whole thing hangs uncertainly between the economic and the sentimental, between the riches and the roots. Ever since Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee?s regime, the annual NRI jamboree has been drawing a rather half-hearted and disappointing crowd in various Indian cities. The local brand promoters are paraded routinely and pan-Indian banquets laid out. Then the prime minister talks about dual citizenship. Mr Manmohan Singh was no exception this time. The package that he offered claims to have gone further than the previous government?s People of Indian Origin card. But the vagueness and the nervousness persist. The welcome barely manages to hide the anxieties.

 First, there are still no voting rights. It is all right to celebrate one?s origins, but full political agency is too risky and brings up uncomfortable questions of ?loyalty?. Dual citizens cannot hold public office either. Besides, it is difficult to avoid forming the impression that people living in the wealthier nations are welcome, but not the others. And citizens of Bangladesh and Pakistan are definitely not welcome. The reverse situation is also not thought through clearly. What about resident Indians who want to be citizens of other countries as well? That is still not allowed. There is perhaps the fear that once that taboo is broken there will be an exodus out of the country. If so, then it might be an idea to go to the roots of this fear and ask why people might wish to leave India in flocks if that were made easier. Globalization turns borders into shadow lines. This is as much an economic process as an internal one. A sense of belonging is a private relationship with a place, and is therefore not entirely within the control of the nation-state. Identities are complicated things and cannot be reduced to questions of passport, visa and work-permit. This might render notions of loyalty and patriotism irrelevant to the compelling and contemporary fluidities of money, work and human attachments.

 TO RECOVER LOST GROUND

 Before the Nagaland ceasefire comes up for rene- wal, the Centre should try to regain the trust of both the people and the rebels, says Nishit Dholabhai

 Changed scenario

 As the taxi winds up the highway from Dimapur to Kohima, a few kilometres away from the Nagaland capital, a table placed by the side of the road becomes a checkpost for the collection of fees from taxi-drivers. This rebel outpost, sans guns of 

 course (none are needed in fact) is not very far off from the ldquo;government rdquo; police post. That is the ldquo;government of the people rsquo;s republic of Nagalim rdquo; or GPRN run by the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-

 Muivah). 

 The outfit is accepted to be in de facto operation, at least as far as apprehending criminals or collecting taxes or even solving land disputes is concerned. One may ask why the Nagaland government should object to it if the people do not seem to mind and more so, since the Centre seems to have forgotten its responsibilities. Cut out from all this the negative trait of extortion, because that issue invariably crops up in all efforts to solve the decades-old problem. The ruling Democratic Alliance of Nagaland in the state has said that it will pave the way for an alternative arrangement. It is obvious that a transition has already begun in the people?s perception here. 

 The situation in Nagaland is a distinct departure from the time eight years ago when certain events were taken as predictable. It is against this backdrop that the six-month ceasefire, due for a renewal next January, should be seen. The ceasefire is being challenged by an increasingly restive NSCN(I-M). As in the past, the run-up to the renewal date of the ceasefire is bargaining time again, and the outfit says that it will discontinue the truce if the Centre does not come up with a clear-cut answer to its demands. The most prominent feature of which is the demand for integrating contiguous Naga-inhabited areas in Manipur, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. 

 A disobedience movement has begun against the Manipur government and the rhetoric in the Naga hills against the Meiteis is high-pitched. What started off as a simple agitation against the decision of the Ibobi Singh government to declare a state integrity day on June 18, smoothly transformed itself into a full-fledged disobedience movement for integration following the shooting of a youth by the state police in June. Manipur has the largest part of the territories being claimed by the Nagas as part of the integrated Naga areas which they wish to be put under a single administrative unit. 

 The Naga Students? Federation has taken over spearheading the agitation started by the All Naga students? Association, Manipur, thus fusing the emotions in both states successfully, just as the NSCN(I-M) had wanted it. That the movement is the brainchild of the NSCN(I-M) is no secret, notwithstanding the denial of NGOs or students that the organization has anything to do with it. In any case, the results of the agitation are being felt both in the valley and the hills, though in different ways. 

 What then prevents the Centre from taking up the matter in right earnest and give a piece of the cake to those, who it believes, deserve it? Come December, there will be repetition of the demand for ?political consensus? as a precondition to integration. That, obviously, will not be bought by the consenting parties, nor will it actually happen. Signs of abrogating a ceasefire with the Khaplang group may buy more time but that can have disastrous results for the delicate balance in inter-Naga tribal relationships.

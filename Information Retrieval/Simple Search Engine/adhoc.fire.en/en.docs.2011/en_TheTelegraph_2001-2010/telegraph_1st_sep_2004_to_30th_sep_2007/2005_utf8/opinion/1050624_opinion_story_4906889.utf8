 HEARD MELODIES, AND SOME LOST IN TRANSLATION

 Living music 

 Rasa Yatra: My Journey in Music By Mallikarjun Mansur,

 Roli, Rs 295

 and An Unheard Melody Annapurna Devi: An authorized biography By Swapan Kumar Bondyopadhyay, 

 Roli, Rs 295

 For obvious reasons, a biography (no matter how authorized or definitive) and a memoir are two different kettles of fish. Among these reasons, objectivity is a rather important one. The memoirist is under no obligation to be objective. On the other hand, Western traditions of biography-writing have always judged biographers by the degree of objectivity they can master.

 Not that Western notions have had much influence on the writing of biographies and memoirs in India. And when it comes to Indian classical music, written documents pale into insignificance in comparison to the rich repertoire of performances. Apart from a few vernacular attempts, there is not much even by way of collecting the anecdotes spawned by the legends of Hindustani classical music. Almost all the biographical works on Indian musicians belong to the second half of the 20th century, by which time many of the pioneering gurus of the gharanas had passed on. 

 Luckily for us, a few memoirs are extant ? Pandit Mallikarjun Mansur?s Rasa Yatra, already available in Kannada, has just been translated into English by the maestro?s son, Rajashekhar Mansur. As a memoir, it is disappointing and short, as if to convey the message that writing a memoir can never be a serious project for a man of music. It does not enlighten the reader about why Mansur remained distinct from the rest of the vocalists of the Jaipur-Atrauli gharana, or how he made the transition from the talim of Neelkanthabua of the Gwalior gharana to that of Manji Khan and Burji Khan of the Jaipur-Atrauli gharana. It does not point out the distinguishing features of the two gharanas that he straddled with ease. Neither does it provide insights into the styles and performances of the vocalists that he had come in contact with. But then, why would a Mallikarjun Mansur agonize with pen and paper when he can say all he has to say through his music?

 Swapan Bondyopadhyay, on the other hand, appears to take his project of bringing Annapurna Devi out of the dark very seriously. Signs of painstaking research ? made all the more difficult by the self-imposed confinement of the legendary player of the surbahar ? are evident all over the book. But the scholarly energies are spent mostly on the philanderings of Pandit Ravi Shankar, Annapurna Devi?s first husband, the trauma that fights with Ali Akbar, her brother, may have caused her as a child, or the tussle with her husband over their son, Subhendra. True, Annapurna Devi?s life cries out for a ?feminist? study, for she is a bit of a ?Shakespeare?s sister?, but what Bondyopadhyay offers is, at best, the Femina reader?s bedside read.

 Indian musicians do not lend themselves easily to literary attempts. With someone like Annapurna Devi, the problems are easily understandable (Bondyopadhyay would have done well to stick to the narrative of Annapurna Devi?s disciples in order to bring out the recluse). But whether it is a biography or memoir, it is nearly impossible to bring the musician to the centrestage and let his or her other personae follow at a distance. 

 If comparisons must be made, the memoirs of Khansahab Alladiya Khan, published in English a few years ago, would be of greater historical value than, say, Mansur?s, simply because the former is peopled by many more characters and is far more anecdotal. The charms of Hindustani classical music, it appears, will always slip the grasp of language. Anecdotes and memoirs can serve a historical purpose. For the rest, there are the mehfils and the earphones.

 A SPENT FORCE TO RECKON WITH

 It is unlikely that the ?Bihar model? or a mahajot can turn things around for the opposition parties in West Bengal, argues Sumanta Sen. People are yet to be convinced that they are an alternative to the CPI(M)

 Not large enough

 ?Scientific rigging? and mahajot or grand alliance are two terms that are heard in the opposition camp in West Bengal fairly regularly and particularly before elections. A third term which is fast gaining popularity in the state?s political vocabulary is ?Bihar model?, coined after the assembly elections in Bihar which saw an end to the Lalu Prasad regime. The argument in Calcutta is that if that model could end fifteen years of ?misrule? in Patna, then why can?t it be effective in bringing the curtain down on three decades of left rule in Bengal?

 The so-called model, however, does not seem to have any place for political parties in its application. The stress is essentially on the Election Commission performing in a manner which will bring the state on a platter to Mamata Banerjee and her associates. They have already pleaded for the appointment of a particular observer who, it is believed, helped Nitish Kumar and the Bharatiya Janata Party-Janata Dal(United) alliance to get the better of Lalu Prasad and his supporters? machinations. One wonders whether Nitish Kumar and his allies would agree. They will naturally insist that it was their intense political campaigning that brought them victory. 

 Privately, Mamata Banerjee and her friends would also perhaps agree with this, but their public stance has always remained that to dislodge the Marxists, they need administrative support from outside. Perhaps they would like steps to be taken which would keep around half the electorate away from the polling booths as had happened in Bihar.

 They seem to be making one big mistake. In Bihar the anti-National Democratic Alliance vote had not only been badly split, a fair section of these voters who had earlier favoured independents had crossed over to the NDA. Thus Lalu Prasad, even while retaining his own vote bank, had not been able to garner additional support. Also, there was a strong anti-incumbency factor which led to ?marginal? seats being grabbed by the other side. Thus essentially it was politics at play and not administrative bandobast. Yes, the polls were peaceful, but as I have stated earlier in these columns, election day disturbances in that state have never been as widespread as popularly believed.

 Now what is the situation in West Bengal? For thirty years, the Left Front has remained a cohesive entity and there is no possibility of its votes getting split. Nor is there such an anti-incumbency feeling that people would rise and throw the Front out; elections to the panchayats, municipalities and then the Lok Sabha established that point. So, as political forces, the opposition has always come a cropper. In a democracy, that fact should have been of prime concern, but the opposition parties do not seem prepared to acknowledge this.

 They, of course, have their own explanation. It is not the people who defeat them but Marxist manipulations or ?silent and scientific rigging?. The expression was originally coined by a newsman who, having failed to get any proof of rigging, came up with the idea that it is done in so ?scientific? a manner that it cannot be seen but only felt after the polls are over. 

 Opposition parties lapped up the idea, for what could be better than projecting themselves as victims of an invisible demon? So they want the EC to adopt such measures, including deployment of the army, as would counter this demon. But the EC also has to function through human beings and how can they be expected to see what the others have always failed to do?

 The EC is, of course, expected to be strict. This time it had decided to be even stricter during the Asansol Lok Sabha by-election. Some new rules were introduced and the opposition said, ?Ah, now comes our chance.? What happened? The Marxists won by a record margin of over 200,000 votes. The other side had clearly failed to notice that people had switched their allegiance and favoured the ruling party in even greater numbers. No anti-incumbency factor was at play and so the EC?s measures could bring no happiness to Kalighat.

 The most famous resident of that south Calcutta locality of course must be seen as putting up a show more for her party workers than for anybody else. Hence, once again, the insistence on a mahajot. She had formed such an alliance with the Congress five years ago by coming out of the NDA, and the world knows what happened. Then, after the elections, she parted company with the Congress although political logic demanded the continuation of the alliance to build an opposition base worth its name at the grassroots level. But that is not the way her mind works: if the Congress was not of any help it had to be discarded and the NDA embraced again. That at least enabled her to regain her cabinet berth.

 This time she has chosen to go about it in a different way. She has roped in some practically non-existent parties, has not ditched the BJP (so far at least) and wants the Congress also to join her bandwagon. And she has got hold of Siddhartha Shankar Ray who is so out of tune with the present that he insists on referring to the 1972 election, which he and the Congress had won in a manner not entirely above suspicion. The Congress wants nothing to do with him and Banerjee should also realize that to many, his name still evokes memories of dark days and darker nights. Not a very useful person to have around at election time.

 What about the Congress? Obviously, it cannot go with the BJP and at the same time head a ?secular? alliance at the Centre. Yet, it also wants an alliance. The election is still some months away and who knows, Sonia Gandhi may yet get Banerjee to part with the BJP. But that may be difficult as nobody can say for sure that the NDA will not bounce back to power. So why should Banerjee risk parting with the BJP a second time and thereby perhaps forfeit all hopes of returning? 

 Interestingly, two Congress leaders who seem keener than others on an alliance with the Trinamool Congress are Subrata Mukherjee and Sudip Bandopadhyay. Both were close aides of Banerjee and both have personal reasons to feel worried. Without an alliance Mukherjee may be putting his Chowringhee seat at risk as would Sudip Bandopadhyay?s wife in Bowbazar. Unless of course they work out an informal arrangement.

 The Communist Party of India (Marxist), on the other hand, has said it will announce its list of candidates next month. Its allies may follow suit. The campaign will also be formally launched then. 

 They will have the field wholly to themselves as the two major opposition parties are as usual not sure where they stand vis-?-vis each other. Both parties often lament that there is no democracy in the state. They do not realize that a practising democracy demands a viable alternative which they, by their actions, have not been able to convince the majority that they can provide. So they have to play with terms and expressions in the desperate hope that these have the magic power to deliver the goods.

 ONCE THERE WERE WARRIORS

 Burma: The forgotten war

 By John Latimer, John Murray, ?6.25

 Most school children would know that the Japanese army invaded Burma in 1942, posing a threat to India, and that by 1944 the British had managed to free Burma from the invaders. However, very few know that the Commonwealth army which defeated the Japanese in Burma had numerous Indians fighting for it. And the imperial Japanese army suffered its greatest defeat in this battle which also broke its back. In this book, John Latimer presents a realistic account of the experiences of the soldiers in this war.

 Military historians in the Sixties and Seventies concentrated on war strategies seen through the eyes of the top-level commanders. The modern method is to explain warfare from the perspective of those forgotten heroes who fought and died in the jungles and the trenches. These men play an important role in the narrative structures adopted by new-generation historians.

 However, Latimer is hampered by the fact that most of the Indian and African soldiers who fought in Burma were illiterate. Very few of them received or wrote letters, and the Indian officers (there were a few of them) were not in the habit of preserving private papers as family heirlooms. As a result, Latimer concerns himself with charting the military experiences of the British and Japanese soldiers. This is a clear indication that the ?history from below? approach, despite its popularity among social historians and theorists, is untenable in Indian military history.

 While documenting the soldiers? experience of battle, one has to address the central question ? why do men fight? Most of the Indian soldiers fought neither for the sake of their country nor for their love of the King . Latimer rightly asserts that regimental honour, a notion of loyalty to the army which they served, and the idea of personal glory especially among ?warrior? communities like Sikhs kept the sepoys fighting the many battles.

 Latimer writes that one characteristic which distinguished the British soldier from his Indian, Chinese and African counterparts was the former?s racial outlook. However, there were a few things which bound the British to their Asian counterparts ? they were not driven by the lofty motive of defeating the evil forces of fascism. Most of the British Tommies wanted to do their job and go home.

 Recent studies on the European battles of the second World War further strengthen this interpretation. Most of the British and American soldiers fighting in Italy and France were not influenced by either nationalism or anti-Fascism. One could conclude that they were incapable of grasping ?high ideology?. It could also be that in a battlefield, where survival depended on split second action, ideology did not play an important role for these men. American sociologists point out that the dynamics of group survival during a firefight enabled a fighting formation to establish primary bonds among the personnel. Such bonding took care of their physical and psychological needs.

 Unlike the Western or Indian soldiers, the Japanese, Latimer argues, came from a society that venerated group obligations rather than individual freedom. The Japanese soldiers were made to believe that their lives belonged to the Emperor. Some of them have been translated and published recently. The diaries show that during the war, the Japanese soldiers were also afraid of death just like the other men. In fact, the brutal Japanese regime, which created problems for the families of those soldiers who surrendered to the allies, was instrumental in hardening the Japanese soldiers? ?will to fight?.

 Critics may state that The Longest War by Louis Allen remains the best work on the war in Burma. However, Latimer?s book definitely balances Allen?s purist account by devoting more pages to the lives of the ordinary soldiers.

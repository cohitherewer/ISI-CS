 GENERATION DIVIDES

 Silent Life: Memoirs of a Writer 

 By Chaman Nahal, 

 Roli, Rs 295

 Being objective while speaking about oneself is perhaps the most difficult feat to achieve. One tends to either get too sentimentally involved or gloss over certain facts. Few can step out and evaluate themselves without bias. Moreover, the writer of an autobiography is always conscious of the act of writing.

 In Silent Life, Nahal speaks about his tryst with languages, his encounter with English, his fascination for words and their formations and his evolving imagination ? all of which contributed his becoming a creative writer. However, his self-consciousness does not cramp his style. Nahal reveals all the hardships that a young writer in India faces. He writes of the time when Indian writing in English had not been recognized even inside the country, let alone abroad.

 What is charming about Nahal?s style is his ability to convey so much by saying so little. He steers clear of euphemisms, and his language is free of trappings. But he is never unpleasantly hard-hitting. Even when he says harsh things, he does so with an admirable lack of sentimentality. For example, in the first chapter, Nahal starts speaking of his eldest sister. Gradually, but in very few words, he informs that she had had several miscarriages and was finally brutally murdered along with her husband during the Partition. Having said that, Nahal ends the section with one simple lament ? ?God is our father and our mother, we are told. He is the ultimate, the final power. He can seemingly do anything with the motion of his little finger. How can he be so callous and brittle, then? Oh, please, sir, give us if not an answer at least an excuse, will you?? ? and then gracefully moves on to ?political storm? that was brewing in the country in the first half of the 20th century.

 Nahal views life with a critical eye but he never loses his sense of humour. His criticism of his father never reflects hatred. One may even call it affectionate, for he also reveals the good his father had done. This sense of balance always prevails in the book. But the reader never gets a glimpse of his vulnerabilities, and this tends to create a distance between the author and his reader. 

 Perhaps Nahal?s language is responsible for this. He reveals that publishers once rejected his works because they were too ?Indian?. Ironically, an Indian reader today might find him too ?English?. Today?s Indian English writers, for instance, would not explain the importance of Jalianwalla Bagh or Benaras. When Nahal does that, modern readers might feel that he has underestimated them. Nevertheless, the book is an excellent read, especially for aspiring writers.

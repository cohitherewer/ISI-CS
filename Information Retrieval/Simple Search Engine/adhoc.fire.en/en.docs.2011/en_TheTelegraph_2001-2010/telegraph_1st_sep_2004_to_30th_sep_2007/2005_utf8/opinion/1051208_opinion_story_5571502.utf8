 CERTAIN PLACE

 Mr Subash Ghisingh has his way again. A special status for Darjeeling under the sixth schedule of the Constitution has significant political implications. It will give far more financial and administrative powers to the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council. More important, it gives the council a constitutional guarantee that it did not have under a state government act. But, the most significant aspect of the change is that it gives the people of the Darjeeling hills a new identity that is both cultural and political. This is what makes Tuesday?s agreement between Mr Ghisingh, the Centre and the state government a big step forward from the pact in 1988 that ended the violent movement for a separate Gorkhaland state. Ever since the Gorkha leader launched the stir, he repeatedly raised the issue of an identity for the people of Darjeeling. He cited treaties between the British Indian government and Nepal in order to point to the ?uncertain? status of Darjeeling and its people. Putting the council under the sixth schedule may be one way of clearing such confusions. It should also fulfil Darjeeling?s old aspiration for self-rule, which the Indian communists had once supported. 

 It is now up to Mr Ghisingh to show what he wants to do with a new identity for his people and more powers for the council. If he takes all these to mean further consolidation of his own powers and continuation of his rule, that is not good enough for the people of Darjeeling. The Gorkhaland movement had left deep scars on Darjeeling?s peace and economy. Much of Mr Ghisingh?s time had been taken up by seemingly endless arguments with New Delhi and Calcutta. He forced the state government to abandon several plans for holding the council elections that are long overdue. Despite getting the special status for Darjeeling, he could raise other contentious issues such as an extension of the council?s territorial limits. Whether he facilitates an early election to the council will be the first test of his sincerity with regard to peace and democracy. A new identity may mean nothing to the people of Darjeeling if it comes with forebodings of future conflicts.

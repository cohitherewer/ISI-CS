 FACE THE CAMERA 

In stark black and white, in blood red, in war grey, 

in burqa blue, and in thousands of other tints, FIVE THOUSAND DAYS: PRESS 

PHOTOGRAPHY IN A CHANGING WORLD (David amp; Charles, ? 29.99) recalls 

15 years of our collective lives, but without the words. Barring the ?succinct? 

captions, there is in fact no need for words here. ?Each photograph?, Harold Evans 

writes in his foreword, ?stands on its own?, and tells its own story ? of revolution, 

heartbreak, savage killings, sporting triumphs, royal sorrow and (thankfully, 

says Evans) normal lives. Roger Bamber?s picture of this four-year-old child, 

providing an enthusiastic one-man audience to a Punch-and-Judy show in Brighton, 

represents one such refreshing slice of life. But this superb collection of the 

works of the members of the British Press Photographers? Association has other 

brilliant slices to offer ? both from ruined homes and the soaring Concorde.

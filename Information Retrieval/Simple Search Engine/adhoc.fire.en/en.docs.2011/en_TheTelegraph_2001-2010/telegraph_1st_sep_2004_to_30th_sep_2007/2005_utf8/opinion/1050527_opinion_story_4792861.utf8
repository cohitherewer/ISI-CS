 PRINCES IN THE ARCHIVES

 THE LAFAYETTE STUDIO AND PRINCELY 

 INDIA (Roli, Rs 395) by Russell Harris is yet another 

 of those coffee-table maharajah books, full of lavish 

 photographs of interesting faces, clothes, jewellery, shoes 

 and furniture ? absorbing for a while, but ultimately forgettable. 

 These photographs of an imperial and aristocratic past are 

 printed from an extensive archive of black-and-white plate 

 negatives discovered in 1968 and now kept in the Victoria 

 amp; Albert Museum, London. This print shows the Cooch 

 Behar princes, most of whom were titled ?Lieutenant Colonel 

 Maharaj Kumar Shri? and were born in the 1880s. They were 

 all sent to Eton for what their mother describes as ?a thorough 

 English education?, and hence found it difficult, when they 

 returned to India, to ?speak freely and fluently in the 

 Cooch Behar language?.

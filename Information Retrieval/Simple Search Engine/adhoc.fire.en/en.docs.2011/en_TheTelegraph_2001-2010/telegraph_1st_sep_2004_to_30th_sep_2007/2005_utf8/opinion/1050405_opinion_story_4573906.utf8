 LIFE ON HOLD

 Who really cared for Terri Schiavo? This is a pitifully na?ve question, yet the one that emerges most poignantly through the drama of the brain-damaged woman?s life and death, now that it has been reduced to an ugly squabbling over last rites and the suspense over an autopsy report. There can be no right-to-die case without ethical problems. The idea of letting someone die gradually by withdrawing her feeding tube is hardly bearable. It is even more unsettling when the decision to withdraw it is based on the preponderance of evidence, assessed by the judiciary, that Schiavo would not have liked to continue ?living? in a brain-dead state. The problems of attribution, beginning with medical assessments of the degree and quality of brain damage, to what could once have been her free will to die, can never be easily resolved. Is there a ?truth? of the matter? It is an intensely painful human problem, but one which must be resolved in the courts. When such difficulties are compounded by the emotions and bitterness generated by parents feuding with the husband, and then by the feud becoming the battlefield for politics, religion and medicine, it becomes impossible to locate a platform for the necessary debate.

 The public nature of Schiavo?s last days would possibly have been more agonizing for her than the prolonging or shortening of her biological life. Her parents? passionate plea for extending the life of their daughter in the hope of newer treatment that could give her the consciousness to indicate what she wished could not fail to touch parents everywhere. But the ones who jumped on the bandwagon were Christian fundamentalists and anti-abortionists, and the ones who intervened were politicians riding the crest of rejuvenated ?values?, such as the president, Mr George W. Bush. Yet many Americans preferred the reiterated verdicts of the courts, for this was the bulwark against a messy mingling of church and state. Schiavo?s husband, Mr Michael Schiavo, who initiated the judicial procedure, is a natural candidate for the black villainy attributed to him by his in-laws, yet a large number of his countrymen felt that his brain-dead wife?s ordeal should end, if the courts agreed. But interests overlap, and issues become irredeemably confused. To learn the lessons of Schiavo?s tragic life and death, it is first necessary to clear the ground of blame-games and fundamentalist dogma.

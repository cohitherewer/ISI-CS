 NECESSARY EVIL

 It is hydra-headed, they say. The more platonic-minded call it protean. But the general idea is quite clear. Evil never dies, it grows two new heads like the monstrous serpent Hydra every time one of its heads is cut off. Else it takes many shapes, like the ancient god Proteus, for it is false and slippery and generator of illusions. So it may well be that evil on the Indian silver screen is not really dead, nor yet sleeping, but merely altered. Certainly there is no longer a large-scale, menacingly jovial Maganlal Meghraj, full of tigerish humour and mocking hospitality, making sure that no part of his threat escapes his captive guests. It is true that Maganlal, played unforgettably by Utpal Dutt, was a figure in Joy Baba Felunath, a film Satyajit Ray made for children. But his knife-edged sophistication was bred of a culture of transparent villainy that was once common to all popular films. From Amjad Khan?s Gabbar Singh in the full-blooded, heart-wrenching blockbuster Sholay to Amrish Puri?s Mogambo in the glorious comic fantasy Mr India ? the most unputdownable villains, full of craft, envy and insatiable hatred, were all of the same stock. How far were they from Jack Nicholson?s Joker in Batman?

 Not very far, but the battle between good and evil is not so clearly defined any more. Transparent villainy demands that there be no fudging over the laying down of the battle-lines and that the mythic potential of the cause be universally recognized. The world has changed too much in recent years, and the perceptions of evil with it. The rich man is more likely to be the hero rather than the villain, the once corrupt businessman a canny saviour. The smuggler is big-time and global, uninterested in national boundaries or in poor patriotic young men intent on rescuing innocent belles. It is the era of the efficient, no-nonsense mafia don ? who would be the real villain in Company, for example? For that cold thrill of fear, it is wiser to rely on the murderous psychological twists in the hero himself, on Shah Rukh Khan?s brittle role-changing in Baazigar perhaps, or Aftab Shivdasani?s lethal charm in Kasoor. And to right the balance in this subtle exchange, the most heroic teacher of a deaf, dumb and blind girl could be an irascible alcoholic.

 Undoubtedly, as critics acknowledge, the Indian popular film is maturing. What is lost in colour and relish is gained in realism and sensitivity. Poetic justice is dead. As is political incorrectness. Naturally, the old villain must go, and, as content determines style, so must his acting style. The new villain, where he can be found, is the citizen of a globalized world. ?Foreigners? are now welcome friends, and terrorists impersonal enemies. Up close, they are as compassionate as in Roja. The foreigner is only villainous in his raj incarnation, but even then, his sister must save the day for the bumbling ?native? cricket team in Lagaan. To dry up the sources of exciting villainy further, there is a whole new ambience around the India-Pakistan story. So in the closest approximation to the old-style villain, Naseeruddin Shah must at least be a brilliant ghazal singer, flamboyant not in evil but in talent. Maturity and sensitivity are very good things. Only the mature viewer will never know the pure fun of black unalloyed villainy.

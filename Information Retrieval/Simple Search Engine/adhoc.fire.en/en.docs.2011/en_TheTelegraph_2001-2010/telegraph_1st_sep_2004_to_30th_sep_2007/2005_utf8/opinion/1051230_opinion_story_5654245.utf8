 IT?S A FREE MARKET OUT THERE

 More at less

 American and British publishers have divided the English language market between themselves: the British edition is exclusively distributed in the former British colonies, and the American editions in Canada, Philippines, Hongkong, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand are shared on a title-to-title basis between the two. These are called territorial rights and it is ?not done? to transgress into the ?other?s? territory.

 But this is as far as theory goes; in practice, the sanctity of territory rights is no longer observed by American publishers who are, after all, the senior partners and call the shots. What happens in practice is that you find two editions of the same book, with different prices, because of the exchange rate between the pound sterling and the dollar. Why is this happening and can anything be done to arrest the breakdown of territorial rights? The first fact to recognize is that in this age of mergers and acquisitions, the major American conglomerates have acquired controlling rights with every major British publisher. Second, every British publisher sells reprint rights for the American edition; they simply cannot survive on the strength of the domestic and traditional export market. The difference in the size of the two markets is on a scale of 1:5. For every 1000 copies the British publisher prints for its market, the American counterpart would do 5000 and more. Therefore 500,000 copies for a paperback in America is no big deal, whereas 50,000 for the same book would be ?respectable? for the British publisher.

 But it is not the scale of American publishing or the size of its market that accounts for the transgression. It is its aggressive marketing and distribution techniques that account for the spillovers into non-reserved territories. American publishers treat books as commodities; they must sell within a stipulated period and if they don?t, free the shelf space and move the stock into bargain counters where it is sold at a little over its cost. This is just half the story. Like elsewhere, American publishers sell the bulk of their stock through wholesalers (they call them ?jobbers?) and chain bookshops. But the same cut-and-thrust selling techniques operate with them as they do with the original publisher. It is the jobbers who sell stock in prohibited territories. If you complain to the publishers of territorial violations, you get a one-line answer that they haven?t done it. Technically, of course, they are right; they know who has done it but there is very little that they can do about it.

 To the question whether Indian publishers should be concerned with the increasing violation of territories, there are two counter-questions. First, what can they do about it? If they cannot do anything, it is best to accept the fait accompli and move on. Second, what is wrong with getting stock at cut prices? The Indian buyer doesn?t have the money for the original prices; there has to be reduced prices for our customers. 

 So, the conclusion is: let the free-for-all roll. You can?t do anything about it when liberalization is in the air.

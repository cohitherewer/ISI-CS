 AGE AND PERFORMANCE

 Politicians and wine always mature with age. On wines this is a proven fact; on politicians it is conventional wisdom. In every other sphere, ageing is considered to be a disadvantage. This is especially true for sportsmen. One of the first pronouncements that Greg Chappell, the newly-appointed coach of the Indian cricket team, made was about the best batsman in the Indian team, Sachin Tendulkar. Chappell made the point that it would be a mistake to expect Tendulkar, who is now thirty-two, to be the player he was when he was twenty. The point is self-evident but often forgotten. Tendulkar, like most sportsmen these days, began very early. In fact, he played his first test match when he was still in his teens. In his early days, free from the pressure to perform all the time, Tendulkar was a superlative stroke player. Some of his shots were breathtaking in their execution and placement. Very few lovers of the game will ever forget the sight of the young and diminutive Tendulkar standing on his toes on the backfoot to straight drive some of the world?s best fast bowlers. But his own reputation took its toll on his elaborate strokemaking as did the responsibility he carried on behalf of the team. With responsibility came caution. He began taking less risks; he cut out some of his shots; he was in less hurry to get his runs. Now age has been added to responsibility, which will inevitably have an impact on his game.

 By the standards of contemporary sports, Tendulkar is already an old person. He has got nearly fifteen years of cricket behind him and has played 124 test matches and 348 one-day internationals. This is bound to take its toll on anyone including someone of Tendulkar?s prodigious talents. But unfortunately, such is the hysteria that pursues cricketing idols in India that people tend to forget the time, energy and talent that Tendulkar has already devoted to the game. Fans refuse to scale down their expectations. Chappell has injected a healthy dose of realism by pointing out the effect that age is having on Tendulkar?s batting and on his overall approach to the game.

 This change that Tendulkar is undergoing is not unique to him. On the contrary, it is in the nature of most modern sports. Sportsmen begin early and hang up their boots early. They also play much more and to more exacting standards. Hence the high burn-out rate. No footballer of today can dream of playing at the age men like Bobby Charlton or Ferenc Puskas were still scoring goals. In cricket, the suggestion that a player can make his debut in his thirties will be considered risible. Yet C.K. Nayudu made his debut when he was well into his thirties.

 Politicians, especially the ones in India, can march on despite their age because there is very little pressure on them to perform and deliver. Wines can age because the older they are the better prices they fetch. Sportsmen enjoy neither of the two luxuries. Today?s idol is tomorrow?s fallen star when he fails to perform.

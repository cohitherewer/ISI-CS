 Letters to Editor

 For whom they toil

 Sir ? In Haryana, Honda Motors did not even have to come into the picture. The police and the administration were there to act on its behalf. The government and its foreign investors are trying to send out a clear message ? any form of protest or rights issues raised by ordinary people would be met with severe repression and brutality. It has been happening for some years in Kashipur and other parts of Orissa. There, police and local officials have functioned almost as a private army of the mining companies. Even for Haryana, it?s not all about Honda either. In 1996, over 18,000 safai karamcharis struck work across the state for 80 days. They were not seeking extra wages or benefits. They wanted their wages to be paid on time. The then Bansi Lal government sacked 6,000 of them. Close to 700 women were jailed under the Essential Services Maintenance Act. Can India really be called a democratic state? 

 Yours faithfully,

 Rohit Prajapati and Trupti Shah, Vadodara

 Law unto himself

 Sir ? In ?Shepherd?s law? (July 25), Ashok Mitra uses some fancy logic to poke fun at the investment plans of some state governments, especially the expenditure of Rs 1,400 crore for the employment of 2,800 workers. As Mitra himself works out, by this estimate, the cost of one unit of labour is Rs 5 million. But without the capital investment, how does Mitra propose that India industrialize or even use its precious resources? Take the conversion of iron ore into steel. Even a fraction would require a capital investment of Rs 20 to 40 million per unit of direct employment. Mitra would obviously see this as an absurdity. Would he then recommend exporting India?s raw materials to countries such as Korea and Japan so that they can do the value addition? 

 Yours faithfully,

N.G. Haksi, Ranchi

 Sir ? The greatest danger with Ashok Mitra?s articles is their sweeping generalizations. Mitra, for instance, argues that it is impossible for the state to employ every single unemployed in a capital-intensive industry. True. But why does he assume that all industries in a market economy are capital intensive? And why should the state alone take the responsibility for generating employment? Mitra?s arguments about class structure and investment are moribund. The flourishing high-tech industries in India are not the result of investments on the part of the state. It is the free market which has led to India?s IT-revolution. Companies in Bangalore provide for their own basic necessities ? from roads all the way down to power generation. And yet they have done well. On the contrary, the industries which are ?sick?, and employ the so-called non-elite, are the ones where the government has poured in millions of the taxpayer?s money. Mitra fails to account for this fundamental anomaly. He even seems to have failed to comprehend the ?trickle down effect?. High-end industries cannot but generate a multiplier effect. Common sense says that the increase in the income of even a few will result in greater spending and greater economic activity down the line. Mitra would do well to remember the words of Churchill ? in capitalism, there is unequal distribution of abundance, in socialism, there is an equal distribution of poverty. 

 Yours faithfully,

Aruni Mukherjee, Washington DC

 Sir ? ?Shepherd?s law? reminds me of that proverbial schoolboy who learnt only one essay for his examinations. Ashok Mitra starts with David Shepherd, the renowned British umpire who raised the very valid point that technology was applied for umpiring in first-class matches while it was not available to thousands of other matches which were not televized. Mitra, instead of discussing the points raised by Shepherd, brought readers to his pet obsession with the ?haves? and the ?have-nots?.

 Yours faithfully,

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta 

 Sir ? All good things must come to an end. So it is with David Shepherd?s umpiring. In fact, Shepherd has been decidedly wise to quit while he is still among the best in the profession. The manner in which Ashok Mitra co-relates Shepherd?s thoughts on elite privileges with the Indian social reality is laudable. However, Mitra stretches the analogy a bit too far. There can be no doubts about the fact that investment in information technology is essential. The problem of the 5 million unemployed is indeed worrisome, but the elite alone cannot be held responsible for that. Trade unionism of the ?have-nots? has not helped them either. Shepherd has rightly focussed on the elite being highlighted in the game of cricket, but industry is a different ball game altogether. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sumant Poddar, Calcutta 

 Sir ? David Shepherd should be told that any match which is not televized is insignificant ? to its audience, and to its fixers who exchange billions of dollars. Any umpiring decision in the first class and test matches is a matter of life and death. Not so for county or roadside cricket, where players and spectators enjoy the game for the sake of it alone and let umpires have their way. As for Ashok Mitra, he needs to redefine his categories of the ?elite? and non-elite.

 Yours faithfully,

J. Acharya, Calcutta

 Be reasonable

 Sir ? In ?One man?s unreason? (July 21), Sumanta Sen blames the West Bengal government and the ruling party for yielding ground to Subash Ghisingh. But he should also be aware of how Ghisingh?s Gorkhaland movement has become an easy formula for the left to win the assembly elections repeatedly. Like a true-blue Bengali, Sen has voiced his objection to the creation of Gorkhaland. He, however, isn?t aware how inexorably we are moving towards it. As far as the Sixth Schedule is concerned, it may be said that this is the second phase in the formation of Gorkhaland. Sen asks whether all Gorkhas, those residing in India as citizens as also those outside the country, are tribals. Indian Gorkhas are under no compulsion to answer that question. As for whether Nepal can still claim to be the only Hindu kingdom in the world, Sen is advised to brush up his facts and figures about Siliguri and the Dooars instead. Thanks to Sen for the reminder that the Congress had supported the idea of a separate state as also the Bharatiya Janata Party.

 Yours faithfully

Birkha Khadka Duvarseli, Siliguri

 Sir ? Sumanta Sen expresses his reservations about Subhas Ghisingh?s demand to bring the Darjeeling Hills within the ambit of the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution. Sen argues that if the Nepalese of Darjeeling are tribals, as also those in other parts of the world, can Nepal still lay claim to being the only Hindu country in the world? If Sen?s logic is followed, then one might ask whether, since a majority of the Bengalis living in India are Hindus, Bangladesh still claim to be an Islamic state? 

 One fails to understand what Nepal?s being or not being the only Hindu kingdom in the world has to do with Darjeeling?s inclusion in the Sixth Schedule. Sen takes it for granted that following a major religion disqualifies a community from being granted tribal status. I should bring to his notice that a majority of the tribes in the North-east are followers of Christianity. If his contention is that a Hindu cannot be a tribal, then he holds a flawed picture of India. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shankar Pandey, Shillong

 Sir ? Fortune favours the brave. Ghisingh is one prime example of this dictum. Undaunted by his declining popularity and failures, he has latched on to another handle to pressure both his own people and the state government.

 Yours faithfully,

N. Roy Burman, Calcutta

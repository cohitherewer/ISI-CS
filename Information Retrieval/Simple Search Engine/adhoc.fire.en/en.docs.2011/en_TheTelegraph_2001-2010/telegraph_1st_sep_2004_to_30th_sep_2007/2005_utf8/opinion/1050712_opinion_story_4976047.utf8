 GROUP THERAPY

 What does it mean to be powerful in Gleneagles and harrowed in London? The richest, and the not-so-rich, leaders gathered at the Group of Eight summit in Scotland will have to ponder the dark comment made on their resolutions and disagreements by the blasts in London. Such a conjunction is part of the history of this summit. The first such meeting of the leading industrialized countries was in 1975 ? to try to sort out ?serious energy problems? brought about by the oil crisis that followed the 1973 Arab-Israeli war. Three decades later, it has become impossible to separate the problem of poverty from that of terror. Africa ? a major focus of this year?s summit ? and west Asia are what the leading nations will have to reckon with together. Among the summit?s achievements is not just the cancelling of the greater part of Africa?s debts and the augmenting of its aid package, but also an additional three billion dollars yearly for Palestine. Russia is now part of the G8 (at Washington?s urging), together with the president of the European Union (Mr Tony Blair thus played a double role at Gleneagles), and significantly, a sub-group of the ?developing five? had also been invited. India and China, primarily, and Mexico, Brazil and South Africa have now grown too important as economies and democracies to be left out of such a gathering. (Russia ? next year?s host ? and China might raise questions about the democracy criterion, but economic might overrides these questions.)

 This summit also marks a change in the nature of the rich nations? concern for Africa. Assistance cannot undermine accountability as well as self-sustenance. Africa?s economic crisis is as much about HIV/AIDS as about corruption, misgovernance and civil wars. Democracy, transparency and governance will have to be prime targets for Africa, together with the Millennium Development Goals. Climate change remains a problem ? largely because of the United States of America?s stubbornness regarding the Kyoto Protocol. And concern about climate change is also the reason why India was in Gleneagles. To be recognized as a significant economic presence is also to take on certain responsibilities. It was canny, therefore, of the Indian prime minister to use Mr George W. Bush?s language and project India?s civilian nuclear requirements as a ?clean? energy option, so that the 1998 post-Pokhran sanctions are lifted.

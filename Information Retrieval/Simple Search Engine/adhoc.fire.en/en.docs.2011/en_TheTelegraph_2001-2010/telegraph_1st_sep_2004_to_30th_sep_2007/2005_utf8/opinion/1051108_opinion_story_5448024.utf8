 WRONG SUM

 The bigger the better, seems to be the sentiment of the University of Calcutta. Undaunted by the enormous number of students sitting their examinations each year ? 300,000 by the latest count ? and the resultant problems ? from mistakes in the marking of papers to late publication of results, the university has decided to turn examinations into a spectacular event marked by precision, transparency and technological wizardry. A campus dedicated to examinations is being planned, with not only space for the candidates sitting the 600 examinations that take place every year, but also huge halls in which examiners will sit together to mark the answers. There has been a growing number of proven errors and episodes of faulty evaluation in recent years. The onus, apparently, is totally on the examiners. No one is questioning the system, in which teachers ? and there are never enough of them willing to be examiners ? are expected to correct an incredible number of answers within a specified time above and beyond their daily duties. So that ?malpractice? and failure in duty may be eliminated, the examiners will now sit in halls like the examinees, with vigilant officials standing guard over them. This could seem either disrespectful or plain mad, until the institution?s love of red tape and officious spectacle is taken into account. If the examiners are the chief culprits, and not the fact of the unmanageable number of candidates, it has to be asked who is responsible for the mistakes on admit cards and registration certificates.

 No plan is likely to be effective, with all the scanners, computers, hi-tech printers and vigilant eyes in the world, if the root of the problem is ignored. That is size. It is practical ? and in tune with the changing times ? not to have an examination complex but to let different institutions affiliated to Calcutta University conduct their own examinations. There may be a hundred different degrees; competition will force up standards, hone expertise and increase variety. The desire for centralized control is self-defeating in the long run. Probably the desire is prompted less by academic reasons than political ones. But it matters little which it is as long as it harms quality and diminishes the credibility of the degree. It is discouraging that Calcutta University is not thinking of changing its examination system, but is investing crores to ensure it stays exactly the same.

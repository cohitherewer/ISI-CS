 JUDGING BY PERFORMANCE

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the Human Development Report 2005

 The relationship between wealth ranking and human development index ranking varies across countries. Bangladesh and China are two of the fastest climbers in the HDI ranking. Since 1990, Bangladesh has risen 14 places in the HDI ranking but just 10 places in the global wealth ranking. What this suggests is that social progress in Bangladesh has outstripped economic advance relative to the performance of other countries. Conversely, China has continued its impressive ascent of the HDI ranking, but economic advance has outpaced social advance. The country has climbed 20 places in the HDI ranking and 32 places in the wealth ranking.

 ...From very different starting points Bangladesh, China and Uganda have all increased their HDI score by about 20 per cent since 1990. In China economic growth has been the biggest component in the change. In Bangladesh income growth was important, though far less so than in China: average income increased at about one-quarter of the rate for China. However, Bangladesh achieved balanced advances across the three dimensions of the HDI, registering stronger gains in life expectancy and education than China did. In Uganda minimal gains were achieved in life expectancy, with the bulk of the HDI gain coming from progress in school enrolment and, to a lesser extent, income. Decomposition exercises raise important issues for policy-makers. Progress in human development requires advances across a broad front: losses in human welfare linked to life expectancy...cannot be compensated for by gains in other areas such as income or education. Moreover, gains in any one area are difficult to sustain in the absence of overall progress. For example, poor health can constrain economic growth and performance in education and slow growth reduces the resources available for social investment... For China the challenge is to ensure that surging income growth is converted into sustained progress in non-income dimensions of human development...In Uganda the challenge is to build on the achievements in education while identifying the reasons that advances in this area and in income are not extended to health. Bangladesh demonstrates that it is possible to sustain strong human development progress across a broad front even at relatively modest levels of income growth. Maintaining this progress, while accelerating economic growth and income poverty reduction, is critical for future development.

 ...Saudi Arabia has a far higher average income than Thailand but a similar HDI ranking...Guatemala has almost double the average income of Vietnam but a lower HDI ranking. Large gaps between wealth and HDI rankings are usually an indicator of deep structural inequalities that block the transmission from wealth creation to human development. They also point to shortcomings in public policy, with governments failing to put in place strategies for extending opportunities among poor, marginalized or disadvantaged groups ...

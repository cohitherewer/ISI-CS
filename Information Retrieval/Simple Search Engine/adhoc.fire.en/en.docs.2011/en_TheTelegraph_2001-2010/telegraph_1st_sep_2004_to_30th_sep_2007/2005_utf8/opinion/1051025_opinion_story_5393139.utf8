 CORRECTING TIME

 The sharp correction in the sensitive index over the last couple of weeks is a natural corollary of its earlier meteoric rise. Stocks, especially in the mid-cap and small-cap segments, had run up too far too fast, and in many cases the rise had been far beyond what was warranted by the fundamentals. Valuations had risen so high that the Indian stock market had become one of the most expensive in the region. The pullback, therefore, should be viewed as a healthy development. To be sure, the recent selling by foreign institutional investors has been worrying investors here, particularly because the rally in the past two years has been almost entirely fuelled by foreign funds. Since interest rates in the United States of America were at very low levels, while the stock market was relatively expensive, funds moved out of the US, scouring world markets in a search for yield. The rise in the Indian stock market was part and parcel of this global trend. Now that US interest rates are rising, the dollar is appreciating and emerging market stocks are no longer as cheap as they used to be, the risk is that the money will flow back to the US. The same logic holds good for funds from Europe and Japan as well ? interest rates in both these regions are poised to rise. As a result of these factors, emerging markets across the world have been buffeted by volatility in recent weeks.

 It is worth noting that, so far as the Indian market is concerned, the flow of foreign funds into it has been particularly strong. That is partly because of the excellent profit growth of Indian companies and partly a realization by foreign investors of the long-term potential of the Indian economy. In some quarters, India is viewed as being where China was two decades ago ? ready for take-off. But these long-run prospects do not mean that India is immune to the ebbs and flows of global liquidity. There are a number of risks in the global economy today, including the very large current account deficits in the US, high oil prices, the housing bubble in the US and the possibility of an investment glut in China. On the other hand, it is very probable that there will be a soft landing for both the US and the Chinese economies, and that the price of oil will go down. But as long as these risks remain, markets will periodically be buffeted by bouts of uncertainty. For investors, caution must be the watchword, and they should keep a wary eye on the figures for FII inflows.

 BARE TRUTHS

 It is important for the president of a democratic country to be able to do things with words. Any other form of action would be improper. And the dignity of this office is premised on a sort of wise passiveness. Mr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam?s wisdom has sometimes fallen short of this ideal passiveness, although never without provocation. A loftily symbolic role is bound to breed its occasional restlessness. His latest address to the nation?s parliamentarians is an expression of a grave concern with India?s political ethos. What he has tried to hold up to his audience are the ?bare truths?. But his manner of presenting these truths in all their bareness, on this particular occasion, has been unexceptionable. Mr Kalam has warned of the ?inevitable disaster and ruination? that could come from a degradation of politics into ?adventurism?. He has linked this to the trading of legislative seats, the debasement of democratic politics to a ?dubious? game of numbers. He has reminded parliamentarians of their responsibility to the country?s ?540 million youths who are below 25?. Just as firmly, he has asserted his own role within the parliamentary system that authorizes such a mode of address.

 Apart from lifting a formal event out of the dullness of the anodyne, Mr Kalam seems to have struck the right balance between the general and the particular, the implicit and the explicit. All those assembled there could not have missed the implied reference to the recent goings on in Jharkhand and Goa. But these specific instances were never explicitly mentioned. Instead, the president?s mode of address, though sharply critical and focussed, went beyond politicking to the ethical principles of democracy, without losing the sense of a real, far-reaching crisis in political values and action. By achieving this rhetorical balance, Mr Kalam has significantly mended his own record of uncalled-for presidential activism, especially with regard to the situation in Jharkhand. Yet, by his sincere outspokenness, he has also affirmed his own status within the democratic system as something more than a mere figurehead. He has also elicited a response from the prime minister which speaks of the urgent need for political and ethical self-examination. And what is most important, this exchange jogged the entire event out of the deadening predictability that normally characterizes such rituals of state.

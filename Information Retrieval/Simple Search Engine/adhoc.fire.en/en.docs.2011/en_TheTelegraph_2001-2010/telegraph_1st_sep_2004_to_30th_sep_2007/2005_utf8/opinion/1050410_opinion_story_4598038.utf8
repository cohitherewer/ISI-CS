 KARAT AND STICK POLICY 

 - ?CPI(M) younger generation more indoctrinaired than older? 

Hardliner Prakash Karat may be gearing up for the CPI(M)?s 

top job, but the party?s relation with the UPA is not likely to see any radical 

shift. BISHAKHA DE SARKAR reports on the implications of tomorrow?s change 

of guard 

 OLD AND THE NEW: Harkishan Singh Surjeet with Prakash Karat (right) at the ongoing CPI(M) congress 

 Not for nothing did they call it the People?s Republic of Jawaharlal Nehru University. It was on the rocky campus of the university, in the tumultuous Seventies, that the first seeds of many a political future were sown. And it was there, on one such revolutionary day, that a student urged his friend to get atop a bus. 

 ?You haven?t seen deprivation of any kind,? Devi Prasad Tripathi ? then a Marxist and now a general secretary of the Nationalist Congress Party ? told Prakash Karat. ?Have you ever sat on the roof of a bus because there was no other way to travel?? Karat, the only son of a widowed mother who had left Burma for India, hadn?t. ?So, we went ? and sat on top of a bus,? says Tripathi. 

 Karat is now steering the bus. As the 18th congress of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) winds up tomorrow, Karat is all set to head the party that he became a member of when he was all of 21. The former president of the JNU students? union will be the general secretary of the party, replacing old war-horse Harkishan Singh Surjeet. Though the final changeover will be announced at the end of the congress, the decision is believed to have been taken at a Polit Bureau members? meeting in the Capital on the eve of the party conclave. 

 All around the party ? and within ? there is speculation on what the change will entail. For years, long before Surjeet started losing the race to age, there was talk, mostly within the party, that Karat would eventually take over from Surjeet. The conjecture spread to the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government as it became clear, in the course of the congress, that 56-year-old Karat would be the new leader. There is a sense of disquiet in the UPA, because Surjeet is a known factor, and Karat has mostly been seen as a backroom boy. And, more importantly for the UPA, Karat is perceived as a hardliner. 

 ?But we don?t really think there is a new threat or a danger to UPA. The threat is there, and it is not there,? says water resources minister Priyaranjan Das Munshi. But another of his colleagues in the Manmohan Singh government is a lot more wary. ?We are concerned because we find the younger generation in the CPI(M) more ?indoctrinaired? than the older lot,? he says. 

 The importance of being Surjeet

 Clearly, the old guard has its hold on national politics ? many say in far greater proportion than the party?s presence would demand. Take Surjeet, for instance. With decades of political activity behind him, he has his friends ? and foes ? in every political party. And though his role, party workers say, has been minimal in the last few years, Surjeet still commands a durbar. Even in February, when he was in Pakistan with CPI general secretary A. B. Bardhan, Pervez Musharraf gave the octogenarian a special hearing. Musharraf didn?t just personally serve Surjeet his tea when he saw that the old Marxist had trouble handling the sugar and milk pots in front of him, but took him aside for a short, one-to-one chat. 

 ?One cannot deny that it was Surjeet who brought the party to the national mainstream,? says a party insider. Adds A.B. Bardhan, ?Surjeet has had both accessibility and acceptability.? 

 But if Surjeet was the more visible face of the party, Karat was its seldom-seen, behind-the-scenes player. ?Of course, he is a scrupulously honest and committed man,? says a politician who has known him for long. ?But he is also of the traditional communist mould.? 

 That, for some in the UPA, is cause for concern. But Karat, himself, is convinced that the UPA has little reason to worry. ?The party?s position is clear. It is not an individual who sets a line, but the party congress,? says the old student of Madras Christian College. ?And our position continues. We will fight the BJP and intensify our struggle on the economic front,? says Karat. 

 But in political circles, there is a fair element of conjecture on the fallouts of a change in guard. Some politicians hold that the fault-lines between the Left and the UPA would get emphasised next year when elections are held in West Bengal and Kerala ? two states where the poll battle will be between the CPI(M) and the Congress. But the CPI(M) states that it not ready to rock the boat. ?We want the government to last its five years,? former West Bengal chief minister Jyoti Basu told reporters on Saturday. ?But we have to have a little patience, and the Congress has to be patient as well.? 

 That the CPI(M) and Congress ? adversaries for long ? need each other is a fact both parties stress. And they point out that the political development of the last decade ? mainly the rise of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ? is a ground reality that neither party can ignore. ?The CPI(M) grew on a plank of anti-Congressism,? says Das Munshi. ?But then the BJP happened.? 

Line of the majority

 Both CPI(M) and Congress leaders point out that little is likely to change in the equation between the parties in the immediate future. CPI(M) Polit Bureau member Sitaram Yechury stresses that there will be no cause for concern if the UPA follows the Common Minimum Programme (CMP) ? a document of policies agreed upon by the Left and constituents of the UPA last year. And the Congress seeks to emphasise that as long as the BJP continues to be a threat to the UPA, the Left?s support will continue. ?Maybe there will be some walk-outs, and perhaps some odd bill will get defeated,? says the Congress minister. ?But there won?t be a threat to the government.? 

 For, even under Karat?s leadership, the party is not likely to take up a radically altered programme. CPI(M) sources point out that Karat has anyway been acting as de-facto head for the last few years because of Surjeet?s serious health problems. Second, they stress that a new leader is not going to lead to a change in the direction that the party takes because decisions are always collectively taken. 

 Still, Karat ? a relatively retiring Marxist, especially when compared with his contemporary, the more visible and vocal Yechury ? has often been viewed in political circles as a hardliner. Many point out that in 1996, when the then National Front wanted Jyoti Basu to head its coalition government, it was Karat who opposed the proposal. And last year when the Congress formed an alliance government, Karat was among those who voted against his party joining the UPA. 

 ?But when we talk about a Karat line that the party follows, we actually mean the line of the majority,? says the party insider, pointing out both the 1996 and 2004 decisions were taken because the majority in the party leadership ? mostly from West Bengal and Kerala ? wanted it that way. ?It is not Karat who is leading West Bengal and Kerala into taking a position ? he is articulating a majority stand,? he says. 

 A man called Sudhir

 Karat?s leadership may not change the CPI(M) ? but it may transform the man. Already, the sources point out, Karat ? known as Sudhir when he was underground during the Emergency ? is more forthcoming than before. Though Karat was elected to the party central committee in 1985 and has been a member of the Polit Bureau since 1992, it was Yechuri, given the role of interacting with the outside world, who had the more visible face. But in recent months, Karat has been busy ? he breakfasts with the Prime Minister and goes to visit finance minister P. Chidambaram to discuss patents and pensions. He has met up with politicians of the UPA, and has a working relationship with Congress president Sonia Gandhi. 

 ?I have been trying to draw him out and introduce him to a wide spectrum of politicians he has not met before,? says a UPA member. ?At a wedding, for instance, I introduced him to a media baron. All this helps.? 

 Some, like Congress general secretary Satyabrat Chaturvedi, believe that the younger lot will bring in changes that will lead to a better relationship between the UPA and the Left. The Congress leadership is younger than ever before, and Chaturvedi points out that Sonia Gandhi?s national advisory council is dominated by younger people, many of whom have Left leanings. ?In fact, we welcome the change,? says Chaturvedi, emphatically. ?The younger lot would be more understanding of the compulsions of the coalition politics,? he says. 

 But, as the old saying goes, it takes two to tango. Yechury points out that for the UPA-Left arrangement to continue, the UPA has to do its bit. ?We will continue to put pressure on the UPA ? not just on the economic front, but in areas where there has been a communal intervention, and where we feel the Congress needs to act.? The move for detoxification ? a phrase in use for undoing some of the policies that the erstwhile BJP-led National Democratic Alliance government put into effect ? will continue, he says. 

 Rules of the game

 And the Congress, the Left stresses, has to go by the rules of the game ? and adhere to the CMP. Das Munshi, for one, doesn?t see that as a problem. ?In this world, be it the Congress when it comes to the CMP, or the CPM, there is hardly any room for hard lines,? the minister says, Adds A. B. Bardhan, ?We don?t go by hard lines or soft lines. Our parties takes a stand on issues that circumstances decide.? 

 But circumstances ? as some caution ? tend to change. Surjeet, for instance, would be finally laying down office to take on a different kind of work. A few days ago, he told Bardhan that he was going to spend his time working on a new volume of the history of the communist movement. And Karat would take over office in a building named after Marxist leader A. K. Gopalan ? under whom the then rookie Keralite back from Edinburgh with a postgraduate degree in politics once worked. Somewhere, history would be written.

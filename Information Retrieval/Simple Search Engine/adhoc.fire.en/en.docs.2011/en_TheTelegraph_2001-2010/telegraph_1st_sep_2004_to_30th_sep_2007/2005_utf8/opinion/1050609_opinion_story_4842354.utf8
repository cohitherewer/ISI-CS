 Letters to Editor

 Darkness persists

 Sir ? Dola Mitra?s ?What lies beneath? (June 5) brings out the darkness beyond the arclights. Actresses of the late 19th and early 20th centuries chose to remain reticent about the social and professional injustice meted out to them. Though candid about their own backgrounds, they could not muster enough courage to point out the double standards of the middle class which relegated them to a life of ignominy, exploitation and ostracism. The very men who patronized their artistry on stage, banished them from the corridors of power and respectability. The saga of slander and suppression continued well into the next century, prompting Kanan Devi, the first lady of the Bengali screen, to lament in her autobiography, Sabare Ami Nami, that theirs was an era when actresses had to bow to the demands of the producers, no matter how revolting they were. Unfortunately, this chauvinistic oligarchy still predominates in one form or another. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Tathagata Sen, Calcutta

 Tiger tracks

 Sir ? It is deplorable that a person of Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi?s stature has been caught for poaching on black bucks. If educated and enlightened public figures like Pataudi continue to kill endangered species, then why are we shouting from our rooftops about our tigers vanishing? Indeed these people should volunteer to appear for free and spread the message on wildlife preservation. Pataudi has reached that stage of life when one usually sits down to write memoirs and do some soul-searching. Instead, he has decided to keep his achievements in deep freeze and go after helpless animals.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Anjan Chatterjee, Nagpur

 Sir ? Pataudi is safe in his hideout (? ?Hunter? goes missing, Gypsy seized?, June 8). The Haryana police has already delayed the procedure against him. Normally, the accused is arrested as soon as any evidence is found against him. But the hunter here is a nawab and that makes things slightly different. It seems as if celebrities have gained the right to violate the country?s laws because they know the routes of escape.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Debasmita Chakravarty, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The bias of the Haryana police was evident from the fact that it refused to lodge a first information report against Pataudi for violating the Wildlife (Protection) Act. This proves that our country has two sets of law ? one for the commoners and the other for the cream of society. For what other reason could the FIR against Pataudi been held up for 36 hours? And why was he allowed to leave Haryana? On the other hand, an activist of People for Animals was booked for ?theft? only because he tried to retrieve the buried carcasses for a fresh post-mortem. Police officials who helped Pataudi escape should be suspended. 

 Yours faithfully,

Subhash C. Agrawal, Delhi

 Sir ? The killing of black bucks is seen as a great act of bravery by our socialites. It is also supposed to enhance the macho image of the stars among their teenage admirers. Hence the popularity of hunting among stars. In reality, this is shameless vandalism and the perpetrators should be brought to book, nawab or not. 

 Yours faithfully,

Prasenjit Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Sir ? It was alarming, though not shocking, to read about ?Tiger caught in car with carcass? (June 6). The news did not shock because we have seen what royal blood is capable of. Pataudi?s son, Saif Ali Khan, had been caught shooting black bucks in Rajasthan. It is because such cases as Saif?s are not taken to their end that the Tigers return to hunting. If the law had been implemented, perhaps, the father could have learnt a lesson from the son. 

 Yours faithfully,

Joydip Kundu, Calcutta

 Sir ? Stars and celebrities become much-admired and much-worshipped public icons. The stars, by killing animals, and sometimes people, have conducted themselves in a shameful manner. And now a celebrity like Pataudi has joined in. Fortunately for them, cases run for ages. Witness the two cases against Salman Khan.

 Yours faithfully,

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? Who knows how many wild animals have been hunted down by the ?well educated and responsible? Nawab of Pataudi before his luck ran out on him. Given the history of such cases and the celebrity status of the accused, it is possible that the matter will be hushed up in the end. The minority status of our former captain may also work in his favour. 

 Yours faithfully,

Udita Agrawal, New Delhi

 Sir ? It is incredible that even in the 21st century, the Pataudis should consider hunting their royal privilege. As there were no restrictions before, thousands of animals had been slaughtered, bringing some species to the point of extinction. Should they be allowed to go scot-free even today?

 Yours faithfully,

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta

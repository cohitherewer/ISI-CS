 LIVING TOGETHER

 Both leftist leaders and investors in Bengal know that Citu and the CPI(M) are inseparable, argues Sumanta Sen

 Part and parcel

 A recurring theme in West Bengal is the so-called tension between the political bosses of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and those in charge of its workers? front or the Centre of Indian Trade Unions. An impression is always sought to be created that the former are fed up with the ?recalcitrance? of the latter, who refuse to toe the party?s line on investor-friendly policies and hence cause the money-bags to be as suspicious of the ruling party as before. What added strength to this argument was the strike last month when even the chief minister?s wife had a bit of a problem reaching her place of work. The conclusion that was quickly reached was that the battle-lines were now drawn between the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee camp and the Chittabrata Mazumdar-Kali Ghosh group.

 But is that really the case? A communist party is a party of the working class, and the trade union plays a pivotal role in its functioning. There may be leaders in the party who have never worked in the trade union-field, or in any mass front, but that does not mean that they can be blind to that reality. To take a small example. The party?s overwhelming victory in the Asansol parliamentary by-election was seen as an endorsement of Bhattacharjee?s economic policy or of liberalization. But in a working-class-dominated constituency, could that victory have been possible without the trade union organization? Where will the party be without the trade unions in the industrial belt of Barrackpore in North 24-Parganas? The party knows this and hence the assumption, that it is on a collision course with the trade union body, has precious little ground to stand upon.

 Then again, West Bengal cannot be seen in isolation from the rest of the country. In Calcutta, Bhattacharjee may not enjoy the company of, say, Rajdeo Goala, but the same cannot be said of the relationship between, again say, Prakash Karat and M.K. Pandhe. And as long as there is no such tension at the central committee office in New Delhi, Bhattacharjee will also have to accept that he cannot expect a life without Citu and its programmes. The programme of any communist or left trade union can only be agitational in nature, it has to be guided by Lenin?s dictum of ?audacity, audacity and yet more audacity?. And Alimuddin Street can have no basic quarrel with that, even as its government seeks to fall in line with the non-left ministries in different states as also at the Centre.

 The issue is not related to any basic contradiction. Yes, in a state like West Bengal, where the party is in office, it has to keep its own militancy a bit under wraps while acknowledging that Citu has its own line to follow. And to the party that makes sense since the fact of its being in the Writers Buildings has not taken away anything from the essential contradiction between the owners and the labour force in the private sector. The ?correct handling? of that contradiction can only be through a process that may make investors unhappy, but is one which is seen as the only way by which the party can further consolidate its position. Here what Bhattacharjee personally feels can be of little consequence. The fact is that as long as he remains a member of a Marxist party, he will have to abide by this ideological position.

 This is an issue which is discussed every now and then and these days there is always a reference to China and the ?reforms? that have been introduced there. Those who do this either do not understand the ground realities or are seeking to create confusion. China is a country that stands on a firm socialist base and the so-called reforms can only be noticed in certain select pockets, introduced in the interest of the country?s own international trade. West Bengal, on the other hand, is not a state on its own. It is within a system which the CPI(M) continues to view as ?oppressive and anti-working people?, as do the other left parties. So, unlike in China, the party leadership in New Delhi cannot be expected to revise its programme to any noticeable extent because, at least on paper, it is still striving to achieve socialism. Hence there can be no comparison between the realities in the two countries. 

 In China, the communists came to power through the path of revolution, whereas in India the communists have got hold of small pockets like West Bengal, Tripura and, now and then, Kerala through the parliamentary path. 

 The party is in the unenviable position of having to run ministries within the ?bourgeois system?, and at the same time remain committed to wrecking it, that too without any blueprint as to how to go about its job. The dilemma is not just that of the political wing. The trade union front also suffers from it and in battling out this problem, one part may at times be seen as stepping on the other?s toes. There is, however, no essential enmity between the two.

 In fact, the trade unions may have their own cause for complaint. It is no secret that the fact of the party being in office for 28 years has led ?lumpen? characters to crowd round it. Often they create mayhem, brandishing the red flag for petty gains from entrepreneurs, mostly middle and small ones. The blame inevitably has to be borne by the Citu, whereas the genesis of the problem lies with local party mandarins encouraging all and sundry to suit their immediate purposes, which are at times even personal. In the larger organized sectors such as jute and tea, the Citu has behaved much more responsibly, often going in for strategic retreats as in the case of the recent wage agreement in the tea industry. 

 So perhaps it is a bit of an exaggeration when it is claimed that it is the trade union front which is always putting the spanner in the ministry?s works. Trade unions, on the other hand, often have to deal with a culture which is more bania than capitalist and which leads to problems which should not have been there in the first place. Unfortunately, the ministry never seems to have addressed this aspect of the situation.

 Besides, is the political observers? anxiety about Citu shared by the investors? These people are hard-headed businessmen. Even in the West Bengal of today they cannot, and certainly do not, harbour any illusion of life without trade unions. Also, it needs to be noted that militant trade unionism is not the monopoly of the left or of West Bengal. 

 Right now in this state a lot of noise is being created over the IT sector not being excluded from the purview of the last strike. Investors have complained to the chief minister and Citu leaders have submitted a memorandum listing their grievances against them. But neither side has taken a position of no return. In fact, one is fairly sure that in the days to come the chief minister will have to take a stand that satisfies both sides. This will not be succumbing to any pressure, but, once again, this will be an acknowledgment of the reality that a communist party and a trade union are inseparable from each other.

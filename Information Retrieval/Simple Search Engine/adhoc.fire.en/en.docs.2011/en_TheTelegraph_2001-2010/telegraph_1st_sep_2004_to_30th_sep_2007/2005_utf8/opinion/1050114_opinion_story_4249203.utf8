 A GREAT RUSH TO GIVE

 NEHA SAHAY

 The ?little emperors? of China are not all that self-centred after all. Six- and seven-year-olds ? single children all ? are queuing up outside embassies and Red Cross centres to donate their savings to tsunami victims. One first-grader, the very first donor the day the Red Cross opened its collection centre in Shenyang, emptied his piggy bank and counted out 177.21 yuan, money he?d been saving for years. He wanted to know how many schools could be built with that much. One mother donated in the name of her six-month-old baby, hoping the receipt would teach her the value of helping those in need, when she grew up.

 Equally remarkable has been the large-heartedness of old people. A 78-year-old gave 1,800 yuan, all the cash she had, saying she was too old to need it. Another, a 70-plus Muslim, gave 20 yuan along with a poem on conquering adversity.

 In a seemingly non-religious country, people have responded on religious lines, praying for and reaching out to their own kind. The famous Shaolin Temple donated 400,000 yuan, taking the China Buddhist Association?s donation up to 9.9 million yuan. Beijing?s old Muslim quarter gave 7,700 yuan in four days. The Chinese government sent seven tonnes of ?Muslim food? prepared by a Muslim food company, to affected countries.

 Indeed, the government has displayed a rare sensitivity for a country as self-congratulatory as China. Announcing a further 500 million yuan in aid, Premier Wen Jiabao recalled the help China had got from friendly countries when it had been in difficulties.

 The most moving offerings have been from the most neglected: a migrant-worker gave his entire monthly salary of 1,000 yuan. Migrant workers have no social security scheme, and every yuan counts now when the Chinese New Year, when everyone heads home, is less than a month away. Twenty-one peasants, all AIDS victims, sent the Red Cross a total of 420 yuan from their hospital in a north China village. 

 Hidden tragedies 

 A retired armyman stood an hour in a queue; while a 74-year-old former civil servant rode two hours in a bus through Beijing?s clogged streets to donate 500 yuan.

 There have been other touching gestures: students at a Shanghai University collected 16,180 yuan for their Sri Lankan batch-mate who lost 10 family members as well as his ancestral home. Then there have been the spectacular donors: the anonymous Beijing couple who gave 5 million yuan; the head of internet portal netease.com, who gave 10 million yuan; the 60-year-old Hangzhou businessman who gave 1 million yuan for Indonesia; Olympian gold-medallist runner Liu Xiang, who donated 50,000 yuan?

 The Red Cross office in Shanghai has been so inundated with calls that its staff doesn?t have time even to drink water. Non-governmental donations so far amount to 150 million yuan ($18.11 million).

 There are, of course, those who refuse to give, pointing out that China has had to face repeated natural disasters alone. 

 Hidden away in this media blitz are the tragedies of those who?ve lost family members. A generation ago it wouldn?t have been possible ? today, mainlanders can actually spend Xmas eve in Phuket with the world?s beautiful people. While more than a hundred Beijingers returned safe, 10 mainlanders are missing, among them 21-year-old Wang Ting. A student of tourism at Bangkok University, she and her Japanese boy-friend had rented a cottage on the sea front.

 On the dark side, already the frauds have begun: on-line facilities for payment have prompted fake websites; fraudulent appeals are being sent through SMS in the name of the Red Cross. Finally, Taiwan has protested that the Chinese government has pressurized affected countries to reject Taiwan?s generous aid offers.

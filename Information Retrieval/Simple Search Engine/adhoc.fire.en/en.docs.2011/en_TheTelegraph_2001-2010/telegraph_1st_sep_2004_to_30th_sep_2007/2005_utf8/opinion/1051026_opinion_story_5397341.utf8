 PLEASE COME CLEAN

 Abhijit Bhattacharyya

 ?It?s not easy to do business in India?, screamed the headline in a leading Indian daily in mid-September, 2005, following the World Bank report, which ranked India 116 out of 155 nations in corruption. More embarrassing was the fact that Nepal was 55, Pakistan 60, Bangladesh 65 and China 91 on the list. The most damaging, however, was the revelation that ?buying a plot of land in India with a warehouse on it means shelling out 9 per cent of the value of the property in stamp duties, legal fees and other charge?, and that it takes ?10 years to close down an unprofitable business in India.?

 The report, and the publicity it has received, has shown India in poor light. But even if we were to believe that the World Bank?s empiricism is shrouded in mystery, the facts before the Central Bureau of Investigation cannot be dismissed. The CBI has found a mind-boggling number of men, in virtually every sensitive department of the government, to be corrupt to the core. 

 Take a look at the figures. There are 11 in customs and central excise, 4 in BSNL, 3 in income tax, 2 in ONGC, 2 in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, 4 in CAPART, 2 in the National Council of Homeopathy, 4 in nationalized banks, 2 in Indian Railways, as also several in the insurance sector, the Mumbai Port Trust, IIT Delhi,the CBI itself, the Cotton Corporation of India, Indian Airlines, Bharat Coking Coal Ltd, Narcotics Control Bureau and the Delhi police, who have been found to be corrupt. 

 Spread of infection

 Ironically, the scourge seems to have affected departments that were till recently untouched. Whoever thought of the director of the National Council of Homeopathy leaking the question paper for the all-India examination? Did he stop to think what doctors passing out of his institution would do in the future? Who would have thought that the best brains in IITs would be thinking more about illegal property than engineering feats? And what happens when the CBI nabs its own officials on charges of corruption? Can a house divided do justice and act fairly? 

 The Central public works department is supposed to be the mainstay of the government of India?s civil construction wing and once had a glorious past. Today, it is a shadow of its former self, with its engineers being responsible for providing sub-standard construction material for India?s roads. But the departments which recur with alarming regularity in corruption cases are the two revenue departments ? income tax, and customs and central excise. 

 Last bastion falls

 Two senior income tax commissioners are in the CBI net. Within 24 hours of the anti-corruption drive, the CBI came up with another information. The chief commissioner of income tax in one of the metros had admitted that direct tax revenue for the first six months of 2005-06 had fallen by almost 20 per cent compared to previous year?s figures. Need we elaborate on why this happened?

 The worst possible scenario is probably in the Narcotics Control Bureau and the uniformed services. The underground narcotics market continues to flourish, promoting money-laundering and the growth of terrorist organizations, which are often financed from the proceeds. When a responsible officer of such a department gets caught with millions of rupees in moveable and immovable property, it shows the weakness of the entire system. 

 And the army? What happens when a major-general of an infantry division in the army is accused of diverting truckloads of subsidized liquor to the market? Will the last bastion of Indian defence be able to stand up to aggression when corruption has so systematically weakened it from inside?

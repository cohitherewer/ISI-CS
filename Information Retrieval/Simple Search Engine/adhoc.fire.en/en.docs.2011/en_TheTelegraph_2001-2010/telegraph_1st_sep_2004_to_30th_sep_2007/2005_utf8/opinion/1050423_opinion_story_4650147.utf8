 SURVIVAL

 OF THE

 FITTEST

 He refuses to be browbeaten by Didi. The Congress awaits him with open arms. Finally, which party will mayor Subrata Mukherjee grace?

 In his home office in Calcutta?s upscale Gariahat, mayor Subrata Mukherjee has little room left for his party leader, Mamata Banerjee. His own images ? in different places and poses, one even with Rajiv Gandhi ? dominate the walls. A portrait of Indira Gandhi, presiding over his desk, is the only exception.

 Of course, Mamata Banerjee, the Trinamul Congress boss, is there ? but only in an election poster plastered carelessly on a pillar in the middle of the room. Even on the posters, Subrata?s image is as big as the leader of the party he belongs to.

 Subrata?s office mirrors his troubled relations with Mamata ? and his deepening desire to create his own space, politically. He seems in no mood to have the Trinamul chief breathing down his neck again, as he says she did during his five-year tenure as mayor of one of the biggest municipal corporations in India with an annual budget of nearly Rs 1,000 crore.

 With his two loyalists suspended by the Trinamul leadership for echoing his demand for an electoral pact with the Congress in the upcoming municipal elections, the great survivor is at a political crossroads. Mukherjee has to now decide which road to take. There is already an open invitation for him to return to the Congress, his ?home? for 35 years. ?I am weighing all the options. I have not decided anything yet,? the 59-year-old leader says. But the mayor adds that he is not going to budge on his demand for a tie-up with the Congress. ?It?s a political position I have taken and I am not afraid of it,? he says.

 In the last corporation election, Trinamul won 57 of the 141 seats. Subrata says it was a minority board, which he kept afloat with support from the Congress councillors. This time, Subrata feels the only way to defeat the CPI(M) and retain the board would be through an alliance with the Congress. The anti-CPI(M) votes should not be split.

 Clearly, Trinamul does not agree. ?There is no question of having an alliance with the Congress as it is in cahoots with the CPI(M), which has kept its government afloat at the Centre,? Subrata Bakshi, the party president, says.

 But such disagreements are hardly surprising. Over the last five years, Subrata has had more disagreements than agreements with the Trinamul leadership.

 Much as he wanted, he could not clear the footpaths of hawkers. Nor was he able to introduce the water tax that he felt was ?absolutely essential? to maintain the city?s crucial water supply system.

 For Subrata, his mayoral assignment was a ?mission?. He wanted to ?discipline? the bloated civic body while delivering goods to residents of Calcutta ? much the same way he had once thought, as a successful C-certificate-holding NCC cadet, he would run a naval command. He cut the staff by 6,000 by refusing to hire people following retirement. At the same time, he jacked up the corporation?s revenue by 42 per cent without imposing a new tax.

 All this did not go down well with the Trinamul leadership, however. He was accused of ignoring the party by not giving jobs to party workers. In fact, as civic services improved and his popularity as mayor ballooned, Mamata Banerjee is said to have felt somewhat threatened. ?Didi felt Subratada was consciously trying to overshadow her,? a party leader says.

 What added fuel to the fire was the mayor?s decision to invite chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to inaugurate several corporation projects, including the unveiling of a statue of Indira Gandhi opposite Birla Planetarium. Mamata did not turn up at the opening of the renovated Star Theatre. In fact, she had called a party meeting on that very day to thwart the opening.

 ?It was childish. As a mayor, you can?t fight the chief minister of a state because then all your projects will get delayed or stalled,? Subrata says. ?In any case, I have no medicine to cure someone of jealousy.?

 Subrata switched to Trinamul over six years ago when he felt, like many, that the party would drive the CPI(M) from power in the 2001 Assembly elections. That calculation went awry because Mamata had not played the card right, he says. 

 But Subrata ? who had survived the Naxalite movement as a Chhatra Parishad leader and then, in his own words, the CPI(M) by winning his Assembly seat in Calcutta eight times ? never gave up, ?despite all the pressure brought on me by my party leadership?. 

 For him, returning to the Congress is no big deal. After all, he has always had a foot in that party. He is still the state president of the trade union wing of the Congress. Some, in fact, would say that Subrata never really left!

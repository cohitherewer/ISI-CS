 Letters to Editor

 Anything but science

 Sir ? The scientific advisory council to the prime minister is living in a fool?s paradise if it thinks a few institutes set up at great expense is all it will take to bring about scientific progress in India (?Rs 500 cr for city science institute?, March 15). Rome was not built in a day. After independence many such institutions were set up, but most of them are moribund today. If these new institutions are to be any good, they will need state-of-the-art laboratories along with the best brains. Unfortunately, we are still dependent on imports of costly, sophisticated instruments for research, many of which remain idle for want of proper maintenance or spares. The council must ask itself why a student today will choose science when there are many avenues ? from modelling to call centres ? which will get them more impressive salaries. Why, even engineers have moved on to MBA or IT!

 Yours faithfully,

Bijit K. Sarkar, Calcutta

 Restricted entry

 Sir ? The United States of America?s denial of a visa to Narendra Modi is nothing but a gimmick. When it comes to foreign policy, the Bush administration?s double standards are now well established. The decision on Modi has nothing to do with law or morality. The world knows how ruthless the Americans have been with innocent Muslims in Afghanistan and Iraq. Shedding crocodile?s tears belatedly for the plight of Indian Muslims will only reinforce its villainous image. Will George W. Bush now apply the same law under which Modi was penalized to the heads of state of every Islamic country where people practising a faith other than Islam are routinely persecuted and even jailed for publicly displaying any symbol of their faith? 

 The decision nevertheless is an affront to the world?s largest democracy and its secular credentials. America needs to be paid back in the same coin. New Delhi must not only condemn the decision forcefully but also highlight the dismal human rights record of the US, especially in Abu Ghraib prison and Guantanamo Bay.

 Yours faithfully,

Shivaji K. Moitra, Kharagpur

 Sir ? People of Indian origin in the US, including many from Gujarat, are not having sleepless nights over the visa refusal to Narendra Modi. The Bharatiya Janata Party has said that this has hurt India?s national pride. Has it? Public memory is short. Some years ago, R. Chidambaram, the former chairman of India?s Atomic Energy Commission and a distinguished scientist, was refused a visa to attend a conference in the US on the grounds that he was instrumental in detonating a nuclear device in Pokhran. That was of greater consequence to India than the present visa refusal to a politician. To his credit, Chidambaram did not kick up a fuss as Modi and his followers are doing.

 Yours faithfully,

Kangayam R. Rangaswamy, Madison, US

 Sir ? The US has the prerogative to decide who can enter the country. But Narendra Modi?s case is not simply that of the denial of a visa to an Indian. He was elected chief minister by millions of Indians. The US action amounts to saying that we Indians are yet to learn to exercise our franchise, as we elect persons who are not worthy even to enter the US. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sanjoy Ghose, Calcutta

 Sir ? America?s denying Narendra Modi a visa is like the kettle calling the pot black. The US has no moral authority; it thinks nothing of violating human rights and jeopardizing world security if its financial interests are at stake. Even the world?s environmental concerns are of no consequence. 

 Yours faithfully,

Udita Agrawal, New Delhi

 Sir ? I was in Ahmedabad when the riots broke out and had to stay put until the violence ended. In my experience, the state apparatus, even if it was not involved, was definitely a mute spectator. In fact, the killing, the looting and the atrocities on minorities had the blessings of the state administration, as this incident I was witness to will prove. I was returning from my morning walk when I found a shopping mall being torched by a mob made up of members of the majority community. I saw a Gypsy with a senior police officer and others present near by. There was also a follow-up van with armed police, but all were enjoying the scene. I approached them and asked why they were not acting. I was told to keep my mouth shut and if I did not, I could be arrested as a perpetrator of the rioting. But the question is, was Modi alone the culprit? Surely not. L.K. Advani did not even have the time to visit such a serious trouble-spot and George Fernandes was quite ineffective. 

 A retired defence personnel, I talked to army officers who were posted there at the time. All of them felt that they could have put down the riot in 24 hours but for the interference of the politicians. Since the Indian people, Indian law, and the Indian government could do nothing to the perpetrators of this mass murder, it seems the US is shaming us to it.

 Yours faithfully,

Partha De Sarkar, Calcutta

 Sir ? Narendra Modi has been denied a visa not because he is a Gujarati or an Indian but because he is an accused in the 2002 Gujarat carnage. The majority of fact-finding missions have been careful to blame the government of Gujarat and not the people of the state. Modi tries to make out that the charges are on all Gujaratis. This is a fascist argument.

 Yours faithfully,

Rohit Prajapati, Trupti Shah, Vadodara

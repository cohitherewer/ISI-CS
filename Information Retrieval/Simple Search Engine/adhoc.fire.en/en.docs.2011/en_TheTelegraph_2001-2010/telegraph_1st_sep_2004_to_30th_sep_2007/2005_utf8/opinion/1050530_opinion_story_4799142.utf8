 STRIKING OUT

 Those who stand aside do not help themselves. The people in Manipur?s Thoubal district rightly decided that they needed to stand up in order to make a difference. Their refusal to meekly submit to the militants? violence is a rare expression of courage in a region where fear dominates people?s lives. It is a statement whose moral strength cannot be overstated. It is not just an inept administration that emboldens gun-wielding militants. Cynical as they are, they thrive on making the people feel powerless against their terror. An apathetic people actually ends up helping the perpetrators of the tyranny. What the people in a corner of Manipur have done is, therefore, of immense significance to the state and to the whole of the North-east. The general strike that they observed to protest against the militants? ways could set examples elsewhere. It is not so much the form of the protest as its moral fibre that is of vital importance. Living in the fear of the extremists? guns can have a most debilitating effect on a people. It is not just the violence or the extortion of money that cripples their lives. But the worst situation is when the people feel utterly powerless to change things. The protest should reassure the people of their power. 

 The other message of the protest is obviously for the government and the security forces. It is necessary to use force to put down violent outfits. The government has a constitutional obligation to ensure that the people live in peace and under the rule of law. But the task is better accomplished if the people are involved in it. The first step towards achieving this is to free the people?s minds from fear. The people must feel confident that the government and the security forces would stand by them when they rise against the militants. Unfortunately, the security forces in Manipur have not always succeeded in winning the people?s confidence. On the contrary, the counter-insurgency operations have sometimes degenerated into gross human-rights violations. The bitter memories of the alleged rape and murder of a woman and the unusual protests by women?s groups a few months back must be fresh in the people?s minds. True, the army?s task is often made more difficult by the insurgents who force civilians to help them with money or shelter. But, no matter how challenging the task is, there is no alternative to winning the people?s confidence.

 WHAT THE PICTURES TELL

 Bollywood: Popular Indian Cinema Through a Transnational lens Edited 

 by Raminder Kaur and Ajay J. Sinha, 

 Sage, Rs 595

 The title of the book suggests that Bollywood is a macrocosm, or, as Christiana Brosisus observes in her essay, a ?theme park? through which a viewer roams like ?flaneur?. It has spawned ?imagined communities? more readily and potently than print capitalism had ever done. It has produced its own brand of transnational Indianness and methodically regulates its consumption pattern.

 The essays in the volume explore the politics of the Bollywood film as also the primary thematic patterns of those films and their moral underpinnings. The essays are organized under three broad rubrics ? Topographies, Trans-actions, and Travels.

 The first section deals with the ?audio-visual economics? of the evolution of Bollywood films. Rosie Thomas studies the making of a militant-nationalist icon in Homi Wadia?s Hunterwali (1935) and also in subsequent Lootrao Lalana and Dilruba Daku. The ?fearless Nadia? in these films epitomized the androgynous cum modern-cosmopolitan Virangana trope which represented a reformulated code of feminine morality, antithetical to that embodied by the traditionalist-aristocratic icon, Devika Rani. Gayatri Chatterjee highlights the re-invention of some iconic images in Indian cinema while Shuddhabrata Sengupta analyses how the cinematographic spectacles of item-numbers in movies like Khalnayak or Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam reflect negotiations between the aesthetic and the material aspects of Bollywood film-making.

 ?Trans-actions? focusses on the fluidity of the ?national fantasy? of the Indian commercial cinema. Geetanjali Gangoli examines the image of the ?vamp? with reference to the ?woman as nation? proposition by Ravi Vasudevan. Koushik Bannerjea?s subject is the projection of ?rogue masculinities? in Amitabh Bachchan?s action-movies. Sudhanva Deshpande calls the neo-liberal Hindi films ?the party of the rich?, allowing other sections of viewers only voyeuristic glimpses.

 ?Travels? comprise articles which trace the movement of the Bollywood brand of Indianness to diasporic Indian audiences.

 The volume is a multi-perspectival assessment of the fetishistic packaging of the ?virtual? Indian reality by the Bollywood ?high? culture. The essays in the volume prove that Bollywood films are ?cultural agents? which regard no fashionable cultural signifier as alien. Rather, they accommodate discrete and disparate elements much in the way talked about in Walter Benjamin?s ?Work of Art in an age of Mechanical Reproduction?.

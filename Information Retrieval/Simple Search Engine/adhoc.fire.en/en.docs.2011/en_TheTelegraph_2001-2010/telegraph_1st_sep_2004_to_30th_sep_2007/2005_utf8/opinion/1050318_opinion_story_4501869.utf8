 SOME NATIVE WISDOM

Between Ethnography and Fiction: Verrier Elwin and 

the Tribal Question in India 

Edited by T.B. Subba and Sujit Som, 

Orient Longman, Rs 550

This collection of essays offers a comprehensive study 

of the work of anthropologist Verrier Elwin in tribal literature and art, tribal 

relations, tribal policy in north-east India, the tribal-missionary interface 

and so on. 

 According to Indra Munshi, Elwin was at his best when he wrote about the life of the tribals. He provided a wealth of information and highlighted the richness of tribal beliefs and practices, while pleading forcefully for their protection. K.C. Baral notes that Elwin lived among the tribals in India as one of them and became a Gandhian. To Elwin, the tribals were ?noble savages?.

 Munshi thinks that Elwin wanted to save what was beautiful and free. He felt that ?simply by living with the tribes, sharing their life as far as possible and to some extent, suffering with them, we would make reparations for their long neglect and their treatment by a hard-hearted world.? 

 There is no doubt that Elwin?s observations on India?s tribes continue to be relevant even fifty years after his death. For most of the tribal communities, independence did not bring freedom from poverty and exploitation. They continue to be alienated from the resources on which depends their survival. 

 R.K. Saha believes that the relationship between the people of the hill and valley was initially brotherly and friendly. Later it turned hierarchical and hostile. The hill?s adoption of Christianity and the valley?s embracing of Vaishnavism had a part to play in this. Nandini Sundar points out that Elwin came down heavily on Christian missionaries for forcible proselytization and their use of money and power to lure and terrify the adivasis. 

 Besides, missionary influence also destroyed folk art. Sarit Chaudhuri quotes Elwin, ?There is much beauty to be found in Indian tribal art?. And this despite the fact that lack of materials, simplicity of tools and uncertainty of life in the frontier areas constrained the art tradition.

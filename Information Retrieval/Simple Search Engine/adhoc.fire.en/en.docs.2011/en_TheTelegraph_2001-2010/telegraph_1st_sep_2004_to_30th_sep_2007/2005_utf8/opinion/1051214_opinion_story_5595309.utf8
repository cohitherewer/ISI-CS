 DIRTY ELEVEN

 The present Indian political class has never been valued for its scruples and its integrity. In fact, most people consider an honest politician to be a contradiction in terms. This is not to suggest that there are no exceptions to the generalization. One has only to think of the prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, whose principal political asset is his integrity. But the presence of the exceptions only serves to prove the rule. The latest revelations about some members of the Lok Sabha accepting money to ask questions in parliament are thus not really shocking. This is a measure of the cynicism that is prevalent about politicians and their scruples. It is significant that the 11 members of parliament who have been caught with their hands in the till, as it were, cut across political parties: they are from the Congress, the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Bahujan Samaj Party. Corruption, obviously knows no ideology, or what is worse, it is an ideology by itself. The left parties are conspicuous by their absence from the list of the tainted. The matter has been referred to an inquiry committee but as a pro tem measure the speaker of the Lok Sabha, Mr Somnath Chatterjee, has asked the 11 MPs not to attend parliament till the matter was settled. Both the Congress and the BJP have also taken the step of suspending these MPs from their parliamentary parties.

 This is not the first time that the phenomenon of corrupt MPs has surfaced. But the scale of the dishonesty is new and disconcerting. In other countries too, including Britain, the same phenomenon has been visible. What is frightening is that only those who have been foolish enough to be caught on camera have been exposed. There is always the lingering suspicion that there other fish who have not been caught in the net. Moreover, the matter of probity in public life on the part of MPs does not relate to their behaviour within the House. MPs often abuse their power and position outside the House. The dictum that even Caesar?s wife should be above suspicion has all but disappeared from Indian political life. Two issues need to be considered while discussing the lack of integrity of politicians. One is that with the deepening of democracy in India, people who are unaware of the unwritten conventions of democracy are entering politics. The other is that in general, there has been a decline in ethical standards in society. A society gets the politicians it deserves.

 TO EVERYONE?S SATISFACTION

 No worries

 There is a vague popular belief that publishers are necessarily dishonest. Vague because the charge is not often substantiated. There is so much petty larceny and nepotism around that it is believed that publishers too are on the same bandwagon, depriving authors of their legitimate royalty dues. ?Necessarily? is a more serious charge because it implies that under-the-table operations are built into the ethos of the industry. But the impression of dishonesty gets blurred as you go deeper into the marketing and sales of books.

 First, to get rid of clich?s. There are honest publishers but like everywhere else there are some corrupt publishers too. Nothing really can be done about them because they are fly-by-night operators. But to be fair, authors too have to take a part of the rap for going to small publishers in their desperation to see themselves in print. Why are authors not happy with their publishers? Is it only because of financial dealings or are there other factors?

 Take the royalty issue first. Royalties are paid on sales made over the financial year and are usually calculated at 10 per cent of the price of the book for every copy sold. But there have been changes. In many cases, it is now 10 per cent of the net receipts ? that is, the money that the publisher receives after providing for the trade discount. That is, instead of getting 10 per cent on a Rs 100 book, as was the case earlier, the author now gets 10 per cent of Rs 70 or Rs 7 only.

 This cut in royalties has been resented by authors who claim that discounts vary from 25 to 33 per cent but the royalty is calculated on the highest discount rate. To an extent this is a legitimate charge but since variable discounts will lead to accounting discrepancies, a flat rate has been fixed.

 But what sums up royalty calculations more is the question of returns. All books are sold on a returnable basis. That is, if copies are not sold within a stipulated period, they could be returned to the publisher. Some authors who keep inquiring how their books are doing could be told one figure, but when royalties are being calculated, the figure could turn out to be lower because of ?returns?. For authors, who don?t understand the trade, this change in sales figures gives the impression that something is fishy.

 With established publishers, royalties have never been a major grouse. What annoys authors are delays in production and ostensible lack of sales promotion. With rapid computerization of the printing process, the first problem has been almost overcome. But authors would do well for themselves if they submitted their ?manuscripts? in floppies or CDs to cut down the production time.

 It is the second factor where no author is fully satisfied. Keeping in mind that everything becomes routinized in the course of time and how crowded the book market has become, publishers can be excused for not giving exclusive attention to a single title. 

 The moral of the story is simple: publishers and authors are in the same boat and rocking it won?t get them anywhere. They have to stick to each other, for better or for worse.

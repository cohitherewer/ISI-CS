 Letters to Editor

 Fever rages 

 Sir ? In Calcutta alone, more than 1,000 cases of dengue have been reported so far, while in Salt Lake and its adjoining areas the virus is spreading like wildfire. But the ministers and officials who run the affairs of the state from their air-conditioned offices are little bothered about the deplorable conditions in which a vast population of the city live. Thus the state health minister, Surjya Kanta Mishra, is content to declare an epidemic and tell the people not to worry. His party colleague, the city mayor, even denies that dengue has reached epidemic proportions (?The ?D? company stays detached?, Sept 7). Is this because now that the municipal elections are over, these leaders do not feel the need to remember the plight of the poor in Calcutta? They haven?t taken steps to ensure that state hospitals do not fall short of dengue-testing kits. But, perhaps, it is foolish to expect anything from the politicians who are unable to ensure that people have the basic necessities of life. They are so busy passing the buck they have no time to take the responsibility to avert the crisis. It will be better if the state government discharges its duties towards Calcuttans instead of preaching anodyne lessons about using mosquito nets while sleeping.

 Yours faithfully,

Anjan Chatterjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? Corporators of the city municipality are simply trying to deflect attention from their own failure by blaming NGOs for the outbreak of dengue in West Bengal (?Doctors to dengue rescue?, Sept 15). Dengue has reached epidemic proportions in Calcutta because of the inaction of the CMC; no NGO has anything to do with it. In this connection, the Calcutta branch of the Indian Medical Association?s offer to volunteer medical services is laudable. But why did the IMA have to wait for the situation to become so serious before offering help? In any event, the ?non-medical? volunteers of NGOs could never render the service that the IMA doctors can in tackling a disease like dengue. Dengue is best controlled through proper care in a hospital. The government hospitals have been doing whatever little they can, but it is unfortunate that few private nursing homes have cared to help dengue patients. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kunal Saha, Columbus, US 

 Sir ? Spreading dengue awareness through kites can only be effective if Calcuttans cared to fly kites (photograph with ?Dossier ahead on dengue war?, Sept 17). But for various reasons ? the onslaught of computer games, for example ? kite-flying no longer is the favoured pastime for people of the city. That the city must be kept free of roadside garbage to minimize the spread of disease is no new message. But our city fathers now have another reason, besides the need to prevent accidents, to ensure that roads are repaired on time. Surely the water that accumulates in the potholes has something to do with the outbreak of diseases?

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Sir ? Why can?t the responsible authorities find out how other cities in developed countries control the mosquito menace so that the dengue crisis can be nipped in the bud? After all, the spread of such diseases is bad for the city?s image and is also a drain on the exchequer.

 Yours faithfully,

Pijush Banerjee, Calcutta

 Fine decree

 Sir ? It is a good thing that the Supreme Court has upheld the Bombay high court?s decision to impose a Rs 20 lakh fine on the political parties who called a bandh in Mumbai in December 2002 (?SC hits where it hurts strikes?, Sept 17). The amount of the fine is symbolic; the actual loss and suffering of the people was perhaps much more. But this apex court order will go a long way in sending the message to our leaders, who consider themselves the guardians of society, that the people of this country cannot be held to ransom through bandhs. It is quite obvious that in most cases, these bandhs do not reflect the feelings of the people, but are thrust upon them by parties as a show of strength for the coming elections. I hope this judgment by the bench of the Supreme Court will not be branded as another instance of ?judicial activism? and will be accepted in its letter and spirit.

 Yours faithfully,

Shanker Dev Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is to be hoped that the Supreme Court levying a fine on the Bharatiya Janata Party and Shiv Sena for calling a strike in Mumbai will not be a one-off affair. Others guilty of similar offences (and I can think of many in West Bengal) should not be spared the same punishment. 

 Yours faithfully,

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

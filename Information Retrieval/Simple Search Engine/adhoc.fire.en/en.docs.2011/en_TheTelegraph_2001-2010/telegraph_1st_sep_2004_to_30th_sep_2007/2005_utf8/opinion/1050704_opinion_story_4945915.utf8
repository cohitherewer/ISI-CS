 IN BIHAR?S IMAGE

 It would not require very much more than common sense to work out that ?law and order? is an important criterion for measuring development. But the World Bank has recently reminded India of this fairly obvious fact. Together with economic and tax reforms, improvement of infrastructure and the end of the subsidy raj, law and order will be an important indicator for the Bank when it prepares its reports on each of the Indian states. The report which has crystallized the Bank?s thinking on law and order is, of course, on Bihar. It has particularly singled out for comment the transformation of abductions for ransom into a local industry in Bihar. The Bank has also mentioned the wasteful bloating up of the police force in Punjab because of the state once having to expend a lot of its resources on terrorism. In all this, the ?image? of the state in the eyes of the other states and the world is of central importance. A negative or problematic image could be a significant obstacle to development. Law and order contributes directly to the formation of this image. And here, too, Bihar is the most important negative example ? rich in resources, natural as well as human, yet almost universally shunned because of its image as a little world turned upside down. Poverty, the caste system, corruption, poor infrastructure and misgovernance are all inextricable from Bihar?s law and order problems, just as the shadow of its insurgency-ridden past still dogs Punjab, especially its police force.

 The legendary anarchy that is part of Bihar?s image in the eyes of an international body like the World Bank, often blinds such bodies to the situation in a state like West Bengal. Here, too, law and order ? urban as well as suburban and rural ? being made a crucial development indicator might change the perception of the state?s achievements in development. Transparency International (India)?s latest India Corruption Study points at the police as the most corrupt public service, both in the popular eye and in actual terms. Law and order ? the reality and the perception ? in West Bengal are inextricable from this specific fact of a corrupt police force. The bandhs in West Bengal, the equivalent of Bihar?s abductions in the realm of legends, are an integral part of this law and order crisis. Development indices and the perceptions of potential investors and funders (like the Bank) become inseparable here.

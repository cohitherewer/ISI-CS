 CAN?T DECIDE

 Rebels often become prisoners of their own rituals. Militant groups in the North-east have a history of stepping up violence on the eve of Independence Day and Republic Day. To them, this has symbolic value insofar as it demonstrates their defiance of the sovereignty of the Indian state. This is the context of the recent spurt of violence in Assam brought about by the United Liberation Front of Asom. But it helps only to expose the futility of the group?s secessionist campaign. This violence further alienates the militants from the ordinary Assamese, who see them as agents of terror. The group?s leaders must be deluding themselves in thinking that their violent means will win them popular sympathy and an ?independent? Assam. Only a few months ago, the ULFA appeared to have responded positively to some peace overtures. The noted Assamese writer, Ms Indira Goswami, mediated on its behalf with New Delhi. But, like other insurgent groups in the region, it sought to use violence as a pressure tactic for the peace negotiations. It is an old ploy, but the militants refuse to see that it does not work.

 It is not difficult, therefore, to understand Mr Tarun Gogoi?s anxiety to see the peace process take off. But that does not mean that the chief minister can afford to lower his guard. Unfortunately, the state government?s level of preparedness seems clearly inadequate. The blast on the Indian Oil?s pipeline at Sibsagar could have been averted if there were armed policemen, and not unarmed home guards, to protect it. It may be difficult to pre-empt the ULFA?s strikes everywhere in the state; but the least that Dispur and New Delhi together can do is identify and protect targets that the militants choose for symbolic effects. The efficiency of Dispur?s intelligence network too leaves much to be desired. An indecisive government is bad for the peace initiative. It is even worse for the battle on hand.

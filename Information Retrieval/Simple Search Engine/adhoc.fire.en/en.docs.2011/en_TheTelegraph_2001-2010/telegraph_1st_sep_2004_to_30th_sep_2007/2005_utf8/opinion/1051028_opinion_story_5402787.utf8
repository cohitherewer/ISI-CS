 TROUBLE IN PARADISE

 Guns not roses

 Insurgent frontiers: essays from the troubled northeast 

 By E.N. Rammohan, India Research Press, $39.95

 This is a collection of essays written by a retired IPS officer who had the opportunity to view the developments in the North-east closely for many years. The author has attempted to put together a detailed account of the disturbances and strifes that have claimed thousands of lives in the region. He has discussed not only the disturbances in Assam, Nagaland, Mizoram and Manipur, but has also brought in the Bangladesh situation as well. Hence the collection of essays can serve as a reference book for those interested in this particular region.

 What is, however, less clear is whether the author wants to provide nuggets of information or analyse them. In order to understand how to contain insurgency, it is not enough to know how insurgent outfits are formed and how they interact with the state. Examining the social roots of militancy is the sine qua non for a firm grasp on the subject. For instance, one has to understand what sort of identity crisis leads to such insurgencies, an issue that has to be dealt specifically.

 On some occasions, the author is highly critical of the state policy in relation to insurgency. This is clearly expressed in his comments on the Manipur situation ? the Central government has always had a standard reaction to any instance of violence in the state ? sending a couple of battalions of paramilitary forces to stop the bloodshed. The author has analysed the causes of insurgency and tries to examine why a group of people take up arms against the army. A point, however, needs to be made in this context. If a group of people feels that they cannot settle their problems without confronting the armed might of the state , one has to first find out whether there is a policy of discrimination against them, or, alternatively, whether some vested interests have prevented the implementation of a just policy. If the former is correct, the state should publicly admit its guilt and rectify itself. If the latter is true, the guilty should be punished.

 Carving out an identity within a broader national identity is crucial for promoting integration. Any one with a degree of understanding of the sub-continent?s social history would know that the concept of Indianness cannot be forced upon a people. The author?s description of the Naga problem makes one suspect that the leaders of independent India have failed to understand this.This was also proved during the anti-foreigner agitation in Assam and the demand for Bodoland.

 The author talks about the threat from Bangladesh, and links it with the country?s internal situation. He raises a significant question ? whether the rise of extremist political outfits in Bangladesh have any bearing on a country like India? There is no dearth of people here who refer to developments in Bangladesh in order to advocate an aggressive policy against minority communities like Muslims, Sikhs and Christians in India. How does one go about breaking this vicious circle asks the author?

 The book is richly informative and implicitly throws many questions to the discerning reader. It is not as if that the readers will have to conform to the views expressed by the author himself. But the questions he raises should provoke discussions and debates and make sensible people aware of the problems that plague the North-east. This is the chief merit of the book.

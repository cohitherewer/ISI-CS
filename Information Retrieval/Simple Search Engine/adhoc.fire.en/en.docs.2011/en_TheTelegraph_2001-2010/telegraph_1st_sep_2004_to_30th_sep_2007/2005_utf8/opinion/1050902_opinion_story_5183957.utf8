 Letters to Editor

 Poor counsel

 Sir ? Caesar?s wife should not only be above suspicion but also appear to be so. Only the extremely na?ve will accept P. Chidambaram?s submission on the floor of parliament that he was unaware that the Central Board of Direct Taxes had retained his wife as its counsel for the fat fee of Rs 2 lakh per appearance, and that if he had known about it, he would have ?nipped it in the bud? (?PC?s plea: No Nalini nepotism?, Aug 30). The CBDT is not just any government of India department, it falls directly under the finance ministry. Also, a communication lag is ruled out since his wife is known to be staying with Chidambaram. 

 But the finance minister is no stranger to controversy. Chidambaram had had to resign as commerce minister in the P.V. Narasimha Rao government when it came to light that he had accepted shares in a company involved in the Harshad Mehta scam, Fairgrowth Financial Services Limited, for their nominal face value and had then sold them at a premium. Chidambaram has not been a very good finance minister. If anything, his approach has been pedestrian, confined to adding new taxes, of which the minimum alternate tax and the fringe benefit tax are the most recent examples. India?s fiscal deficit and its debt burden have grown during his tenure, but their effect has been camouflaged because the country?s gross domestic product has been rising fairly well. Manmohan Singh should take over the finance portfolio himself and Chidambaram should set an example by resigning.

 Yours faithfully,

N. Narasimhan, Bangalore

 Sir ? It is very difficult to believe the finance minister?s protestations of innocence, especially since the case Nalini Chidambaram was fighting had to do with taxes imposed on some textile mills in Tamil Nadu, one of which is allegedly owned by the finance minister?s brother. During his earlier tenure as finance minister in 1997, Chidambaram had come up with the voluntary disclosure of income scheme, which showed that he is prepared to more than tolerate corruption. 

 Yours faithfully,

B.S. Ganesh, Bangalore

 Sir ? How the opposition makes a mountain out of a molehill! Take Sushma Swaraj?s angry speech in parliament over Nalini Chidambaram fighting a case for the CBDT. The minister?s wife was paid no more than a few lakhs, but had P. Chidambaram been truly dishonest, he could have made a hundred times more with even less effort. Even if it were true that the finance minister?s family has stakes in Karpagambal Mills, any lawyer whom the CBDT had employed would have had to work as per its brief. The lawyer has nothing to do with the outcome of a lawsuit. Is it not enough that both P. Chidambaram and the CBDT have accepted the lapse gracefully?

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

 Sir ? I suggest we make a new law. ?No relative of a Minister/ Member of Parliament or Legislative Assembly, Chief Minister, Governor, or any other elected member holding public office etc, shall be appointed in a post of whatsoever nature and such relatives shall be barred from all commercial transaction ? tenders, quotations, public auctions of lands and buildings etc ? in Central/state/local government dealings.? 

 Yours faithfully,

 A hero in his times 

 Sir ? Swapan Dasgupta locates the appeal of Mangal Pandey in Indians supposedly being more fond of make-believe than of history (?What we like to believe?, Aug 26). He feels that by appealing to our patriotic feelings, such films help reawaken curiosity about our past. In this connection, one is reminded of Richard Attenborough?s Gandhi and Shyam Benegal?s Netaji: The Forgotten Hero. Both these films had national heroes as protagonists but they did not censor or soft-pedal contentious issues. Moreover, both had a broad canvas that was so true to life that viewers could easily establish a degree of emotional correspondence with the present. In contrast, Ketan Mehta seems little bothered about historical authenticity and hence the viewers feel as remote as ever from the events of 1857.

 Yours faithfully,

Tanmoy Bhattacharjee, Howrah

 Sir ? Swapan Dasgupta is right. Mangal Pandey will certainly compel the present generation to turn the pages of history to what happened before and after 1857. It?s sad that the young today know more about fictitious heroes like Superman, Batman, Harry Potter than about the real heroes who sacrificed their lives for the cause of India?s freedom. But today?s Indian directors are swayed too much by commercial interests; they need to work on their scripts more. If only they would exclude the trivialities, their films would appeal to more people besides increasingly their credibilty. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad

 Sir ?Though Mangal Pandey is far from true to history, it is entertaining nonetheless. It is certainly more watchable than Netaji ? The Forgotten Hero, which was little more than a supplement to the history text-books.

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Sir ? A revolutionary icon, Mangal Pandey is also part of our folklore and has inspired generations of Indians with valour and patriotism. Thus it is very unkind of the copywriter of the Amul butter advertisement to caricature him as ?Makhan Ande?. It only betrays his ignorance. A Brahmin, Pandey must have been a strict vegetarian and certainly never had eggs. Amul India must withdraw the hoarding forthwith. 

 Yours faithfully,

Mehmood M. Abdi, Mumbai

 Sir ? Mangal Pandey is not history; such distortion of the story of our great revolutionary is downright disgraceful. Yawn. The director clearly says at the outset that ?when history meets folklore, legends are born?. Mangal Pandey is a legend ? very little about his life is available in documents. Okay, Pandey was probably hanged in secrecy and not publicly ? but that scene was symbolic of how he inspired an entire generation, not about the details of the exact nature of his hanging. The battle scenes could have been longer, but were well shot. The insurrection of 1857 was well put in the context of the independence movement at the end. The film rocks! It?s one of those rare Hindi movies that one can sit through without glancing at the watch even once. 

 Yours faithfully,

Aruni Mukherjee, Calcutta

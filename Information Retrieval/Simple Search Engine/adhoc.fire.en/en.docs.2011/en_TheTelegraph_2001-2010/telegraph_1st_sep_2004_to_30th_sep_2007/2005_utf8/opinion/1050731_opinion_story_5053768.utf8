 ALL THOSE PETER PANS

 Comic strip characters have a life of their own but they seldom age. It is difficult to imagine an aged Phantom, the ghost who walks, an Asterix gone senile and a doddering Tintin. Thus, the news that the Bumsteads, Blondie and Dagwood, are turning 75 is difficult to believe. Asterix and his friend Obelix, the menhir delivery man, have been protecting, with a little bit of help from Getafix the druid, the nameless Gaulish village since the time of Julius Caesar. Hagar the Horrible harks back to medieval times. Dagwood Bumstead has been sleeping on the sofa, instead of mowing the lawn which he promised to do, ever since he first appeared in a comic strip created by Murat ?Chic? Young. Dagwood, in his original avatar, was not a lazy bum but the playboy son of a railroad tycoon. He was then dating the pretty Blondie Boopadoop. But reality intruded on life in the comic strip. As the impact of the 1929 Depression came to be felt in the United States of America, public interest in the exploits of the rich plummeted. Dagwood?s persona changed. He married Blondie and his wealthy parents disinherited him because they disapproved of Blondie. Dagwood and Blondie became a middle class couple: he forever squabbling with a whimsical and domineering boss, and she struggling to set up a catering business.

 Characters in comic strips are the real Peter Pans. They do not age and they manage not only to survive through the ages but also to attract the attention of readers. The tastes of the reading public of the Thirties are in no way similar to the tastes of those who read newspapers and magazines today. Yet, when it comes to reading comic strips, there is an element of continuity. The Bumsteads remain popular, as do Tintin, Phantom and so on. Dennis continues to menace the life of his neighbour George, and to endear himself to George?s long-suffering wife Martha. (Many believe that George and Martha refer to the original first family of the US, the Washingtons.) It is this agelessness which is the hallmark of a great comic strip. Their lasting popularity is the sign that they do not stale.

 The ability to traverse time and geography contributes to the making of a classic in any given genre. The numbers relating to the Bumsteads are staggering. They are not only 75 years old but they appear in 2,300 newspapers in 55 countries, and have a readership of 250 million in 35 languages. Comparable figures for other classics in the comic strip genre would be similarly staggering. But measuring a comic strip through dry-as-dust statistics would be an insult to them. Such a yardstick would bring forth the choicest epithets from Captain Haddock. Obelix would say, ?By Toutatis, these humans are crazy.?

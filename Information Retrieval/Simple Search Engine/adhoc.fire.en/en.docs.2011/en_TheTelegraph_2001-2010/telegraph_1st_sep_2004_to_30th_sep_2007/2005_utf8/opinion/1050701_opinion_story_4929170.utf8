 TO MAKE AN EASY KILLING

 Quick money

 Coffee-table pictorial biographies of the Big and the Famous seem to have become a regular feature of some publishing houses. If you take two recent biographies, Indira Gandhi ? A Living Legacy and Bal Thackeray: A Photo Biography as models to go by, there are three distinct features in such photo albums. First, they encompass the subject?s entire life, from childhood till he becomes a celebrity, with a clear subtext that this is the autobiography of the self-made person. Second, the text is cut to the bone; in fact, it is often reduced to just captions to the pictures. Third, they are all beautifully produced and beautifully priced.

 Literary patronage in the broadest, non-pejorative sense has been around for quite some time but in the case of photo biographies, two questions need to be asked. Who pays for these lavish productions and who buys such books? And following these is the bigger question ? whether accepting aid isn?t injurious to the publishing house because it takes away the focus from the main publishing activities?

 At the outset, let it be said that the publisher does not foot the entire bill for such books which cost anywhere between Rs 8-10 lakh for a print run of 5000 copies in hardback editions. Production costs are paid for by another agency, in most cases, front organizations for political parties.

 If the production costs are not paid cash-down, the agency makes a commitment to pick up the entire print run at an agreed price with payment made within 30 days of delivery. The publisher makes no investment of his own, apart from providing the professional expertise of ?seeing it through? to the press. What the agency does with the copies of the book is of no concern to the publisher; he is only interested in the ?deal?and getting his money for services rendered.

 Of course, some copies of these pictorials are given out gratis to leading trade outlets for display but no publisher seriously expects even a few to be sold. The books are not designed for individual buyers or for institutional libraries. Publishers know that those interested would get their copies, ?With Compliments from?, and therefore, there is little point in promoting them. Why do publishers go into such projects? First and the most obvious reason is the quick money and good money at that. Second, they believe that political contacts at the highest level would spin off into other benefits that would come in handy on a rainy day. 

 The great disadvantage of such PR publishing is that it draws away scarce editorial resources from the more urgent projects. Indian publishing houses are small organizations with a few editors and production managers to manage all the processes from copy-editing manuscripts to their final delivery to printing houses. 

 Sadly, these ?deals? are growing thick and fast, not only with the big and the mighty, but even in the academic world which has seen a sharp decline in standards. Who is to be blamed, the publisher or the author(s)? Or are they in the same boat of making a fast buck?

 Letters to Editor

 Another feather in the cap

 Sir ? Batting against Sri Lanka, Sachin Tendulkar broke Sunil Gavaskar?s record of 34 centuries to become the highest century scorer in the history of test cricket (?This one?s special, very special, says Sachin?, Dec 11). Indian cricket fans would like to congratulate him on accomplishing this rare feat and hope that Tendulkar would continue to win more laurels for the country. In a cricket-crazy country like ours, Tendulkar is treated like a demigod. Therefore, it is only natural for cricket lovers to rejoice on his recent achievement. The adulation for Tendulkar makes one wonder how his fans and the media would react if he goes on to break Brian Lara?s record. Tendulkar is expected to play a decent knock in every match, especially in the crucial ones. One hopes that he will continue to make his country proud with his valuable contributions to every match he plays.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Sachin Tendulkar?s 35th test century against the Lankans in Delhi is a tribute to the game of cricket. He has performed well throughout his career and his batting average is almost as good as Donald Bradman?s. This is, undoubtedly, an achievement and only goes to show how important he is both to the Indian cricket team and to the game in general. Sunil Gavaskar, writing in his column for The Telegraph, ?Congrats, Sachin? (Dec 11), said that he hoped Tendulkar would go on to make 50 test centuries. The little master?s words echo the sentiments of cricket lovers not only in India but also those around the world. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Another milestone was reached in world cricket when Sachin Tendulkar scored his 35th test century. Apart from being the highest runscorer in one day internationals, Tendulkar now holds the record of scoring the highest number of test centuries. His contribution to Indian cricket is unmatched. Hopefully, Tendulkar will retain his form and fitness and continue to score heavily during the World cup two years from now. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Rajib Dey, Habra

 Sir ? Sachin Tendulkar has variously been described as little master, master blaster, Bombay bomber and so on. His popularity cuts across religion, caste and creed. Statistics tell only half the story about the genius. The way he plays shots like the off drive, flick, paddle sweep and cut, is fascinating. Tendulkar would have smashed many more records had not the injuries come in his way. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? In his congratulatory message to Tendulkar, the original little master, Sunil Gavaskar, said that the champion cricketer was an example of the perfect batsman. Gavaskar praised Sachin for the stillness of his head, his straight back-lift, the ease with which he played his shots and their wide range. In a recent interview, Tendulkar had said that he remained fully committed to the game even after sixteen long years in international cricket. An experienced player, he seems to be well aware of the fact that records have their own place in history, but when it comes cricket, a game of glorious uncertainties, what matters more is how a player maintains his consistency. Young players in the Indian team and those who aspire to don the country?s colours in the future should see in Tendulkar the perfect role model. At 32, he still shows promise, which makes it possible for us to expect the world of him.

 Yours faithfully,

Suman Barthakur, Guwahati

 Sir ? There is no doubt that Sachin Tendulkar?s achievement is a rarity in international cricket. But a close scrutiny of the records would show that Bradman?s record is much more impressive than Tendulkar?s. The Australian scored 29 centuries in 80 innings while Tendulkar took many more matches to score his 35 hundreds. Moreover, many of them were scored while playing against weaker teams like Bangladesh and Zimbabwe. The media in India have ignored this point while praising Tendulkar. Is it because he happens to be an Indian?

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? The mauler from Mumbai silenced his critics in style by surpassing the number of centuries scored by Sunil Gavaskar in test cricket. Yet one needs to remember that the former Indian great had scored most of his centuries against the West Indies which had bowlers like Andy Roberts, Michael Holding and Malcolm Marshall. Tendulkar, did not have to face these bowlers in their prime during his career. Tendulkar can now think of breaking Brian Lara?s record and go on to become the only player to have scored the highest number of runs in both versions of the game.

 Yours faithfully,

R. Sekar, Angul

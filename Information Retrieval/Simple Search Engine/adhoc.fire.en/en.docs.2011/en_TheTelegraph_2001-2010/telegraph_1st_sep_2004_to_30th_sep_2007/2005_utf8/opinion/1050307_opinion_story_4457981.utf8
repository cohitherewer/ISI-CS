 Letters to Editor

 Bold, but not beautiful

 Sir ? ?Make-under?, rather than make-over, seems to be the winning formula at the Oscars these days. Last year, Charlize Theron transformed herself into an unsavoury-looking, serial-killing prostitute for Monster and walked away with the best actress Oscar. This year it was Hillary Swank?s turn to play a boxer in Million Dollar Baby ? a pretty boxer is quite unheard of ? and, of course, grab the statuette. This is perhaps a new aspect of Hollywood?s obsession with the underdog, also reflected this year in Jamie Foxx winning the best actor Oscar for playing the blind singer, Ray Charles. Thank god for the likes of Martin Scorcese, who could still make a film on the life of Howard Hughes ? The Aviator who was rich, famous, and did not have a traumatic childhood or any obvious disability ? even though Uncle Oscar?s dislike for such characters is more than evident.

 Yours faithfully,

Sumana Ghosh, Calcutta

 Governing ills

 Sir ? The discretionary misadventures of S.C. Jamir in Goa and Syed Sibtey Razi in Jharkhand have made it clear that it is no longer safe to have governors, political recruits as they are, invested with unqualified discretionary powers in the matter of making and breaking governments. The time has come for the politicians to sit with the jurists of the country and outline the limits of gubernatorial powers. The task is not too difficult. A careful study of the cases of gubernatorial interventions made since 1952 will show exactly where these constitutional functionaries have gone wrong and help prescribe the remedies. In this age of coalition politics and fragmented electoral verdicts, contingencies such as Goa and Jharkhand may emerge more often than not in future. These ?whipping boys? of the ruling parties in Delhi, unless bound by clear-cut legislations, will take decisions so as not to jeopardize their positions in the cozy nooks of the Raj Bhavans. The discretionary powers of governors could be suspended for some time. If this is done, both the governors and the political parties will be spared ridiculous situations like Jharkhand in future

 Yours faithfully,

P.K. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? The swearing in of Shibu Soren as chief minister of Jharkhand is possibly as naked and cynical a display of power by the Congress-led Central government as the one seen during the pogrom carried out by the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government in Gujarat in 2002. In one sense, the Jharkhand episode may be considered as poetic justice, since it is the BJP which is at the receiving end. Whatever the implications for the political parties, for ordinary people, these events put a large question mark on the future of democracy in India. 

 Yours faithfully,

N.G. Haksi, Ranchi

 Sir ? Most people, I am sure, will agree with Pratap Bhanu Mehta that the Jharkhand governor?s decision to install Shibu Soren as the chief minister and giving him three weeks to gather the required number of legislators violate all constitutional norms (?Party powered?, March 3). His actions have sullied the very position of the governor in the eyes of the public. Lately, governors have been in the eye of the storm for being obsequious servants of the ruling party at the Centre. While the Congress is not new to using the position of the governor to further its narrow political goals, the governors had a little more self-esteem in the old days. The dramatic change in the character of the post came about with the birth of coalition politics. It is time the political parties reached a consensus so that only people of eminence who are able to discharge their constitutional responsibilities in the right spirit are appointed to these prestigious posts.

 Yours faithfully,

Shivaji K. Moitra, Kharagpur

 Sir ? The National Democratic Alliance leaders are making too much fuss over the Jharkhand governor?s action. The argument that the NDA is the single largest pre-poll alliance does not hold good. It may be recalled that Atal Bihari Vajpayee as the prime minister in 1996 and Nitish Kumar as the chief minister of Bihar in 2000, both heading the single largest pre-poll alliance, failed to prove their majority on the floor of the house. The NDA should stop pointing fingers at the Congress as both play the dirty game of Indian politics.

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Aditya, Bhubaneswar

 Sir ? The latest political developments in Jharkhand and Bihar show that the Congress has started paying the price of keeping bad company. The inclusion of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and the Rashtriya Janata Dal in the UPA to retain power at the Centre has begun to affect the party?s fate in state politics. The goodwill generated by Sonia Gandhi?s decision to refuse prime ministership last year is fast being eroded because of the party?s recent actions, such as the indefensible act of hoisting the minority JMM government in Jharkhand, preceded by the unethical installation of an unviable Congress government in Goa. The moral of the story: one Sonia Gandhi cannot change the fundamental immorality of the party.

 Yours faithfully,

S.K. Khemka, Calcutta 

 Sir ? A little boldness, coupled with some transparency, would have saved the Jharkhand governor all the brickbats he has been getting. He should have made public what transpired between him and the members of the legislative assembly of Jharkhand who were paraded before him. Both the lists of supporting MLAs furnished by the UPA and NDA coalitions should have been handed to the media as well. The double-dealers would have been exposed, and the people would have made sure that things took their own course. How, now, does Razi propose to check horse-trading before the show of strength in the assembly?

 Yours faithfully,

Shyama Prasad Choudhury, Calcutta

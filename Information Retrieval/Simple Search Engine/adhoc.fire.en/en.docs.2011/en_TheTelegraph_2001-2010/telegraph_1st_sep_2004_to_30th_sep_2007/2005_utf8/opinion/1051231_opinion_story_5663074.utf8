 THE VAJPAYEE CODE

 For most people, the announcement of retirement from political life would be a straightforward business. Not so for Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee. On the last day of the meeting of the national executive of the Bharatiya Janata Party, he announced that he would no longer take part in electoral politics. But this simple declaration, in the case of Mr Vajpayee, was laced with allusions to incidents in the great epics of India. The allusions, elliptical and enigmatic, had people scurrying to find hidden meanings and significance. Mr Vajpayee has, over the years, earned for himself the reputation of speaking in riddles, of endowing an innocent remark with layers of meaning and of saying one thing and meaning another. He has the rare cunning of bringing to innocuous statements the sign of the rose. If, as the best-selling author, Dan Brown, has argued, Leonardo Da Vinci?s paintings were all imbued with a secret meaning, then Mr Vajpayee is given to speaking in a code which is uniquely his own.

 In announcing his retirement from active politics, Mr Vajpayee alluded to the Ramayana and remarked that, like Parasuram, he was withdrawing from the coronation of Rama and Lakshmana. He clarified that by Rama and Lakshmana he meant Mr L.K. Advani and Mr Pramod Mahajan. But if the allusion were to be pursued, then a host of enigmatic questions would suggest themselves. Parasuram had obliterated Kshatriyas from the earth. Was Mr Vajpayee, by styling himself Parasuram, the legendary Kshatriya killer, expressing his disapproval of the appointment of Mr Rajnath Singh as the president of the BJP? Was the extolling of Mr Advani and Mr Mahajan as the two heroes of the epic meant to indicate that they are the real powers in the party and Mr Singh a mere figurehead? Finally, if one were to take seriously Mr Vajpayee?s identification with Parasuram, then the implications are very disconcerting for the BJP and for himself. Parasuram, legend has it, at the behest of his father, killed his mother with an axe, and as a result of this matricide, a curse fell on him and the axe remained stuck to his hand. What is Mr Vajpayee suggesting through this allusion? Has he killed his mother party? At whose behest? With what? And what is the curse? Bewildering questions chase a bewildering analogy.

 Mr Vajpayee is cursed by the sign of equivocation. This has been a source of his strength and his weakness. He has commanded respect but has never won trust. Parasuram had a loyal disciple in Karna, Mr Vajpayee has none. But the timing and the target of his equivocation have always been impeccable. The national executive in Mumbai was billed as Mr Advani?s farewell to the party presidentship. Mr Vajpayee ensured through his allusions that he will be the better remembered at Mr Advani?s farewell national executive. It was not very generous but it was clever. Arjuna?s charioteer would have been proud.

 MORE REFORMS

 The World Trade Organization?s sixth ministerial conference is due in Hong Kong soon, that is on December 13-18. The Doha work programme started in 2001, and had an initial deadline of January 2005 for completion. Meanwhile, the fifth ministerial in Cancun in 2003 ended in failure and the mid-term review of the DWP negotiations could not take place. The prospects of a WTO agreement seemed bleak until the July 31, 2004 framework agreement revived hopes. However, as many commentators then said, the framework agreement only represented a skeleton. Without flesh and bones, little headway could be made and negotiating flesh and bones in agriculture is proving to be impossible.

 While the WTO secretariat continues to be optimistic and the draft ministerial declaration talks of a deadline of 2006, there is near consensus that Hong Kong will end in a deadlock. There are suggestions of a ministerial or mini-ministerial in March/April 2006. But since the European Union continues to be inflexible, with the US president?s fast track negotiating authority expiring in early 2007, the DWP is probably knocked back till 2010. Weaker developing countries like India have a vested interest in multilateralism, especially because of multilateral rules. But none of these rules were due for drastic revisions in the DWP, not even anti-dumping. Conversely, there is a lot of public opinion in India, and not just from the left, suggesting that India should not yield to pressures from developed countries.

 This is particularly pertinent for agriculture, where, in the absence of domestic reforms, India?s export prospects are bleak, and there are import threats to edible oils and dairy products. Notwithstanding India?s interest in the multilateral system, one therefore suspects that Mr Kamal Nath, Union minister for commerce and industry, will be happy enough if nothing transpires in Hong Kong, as long as the core negotiating group of India, Brazil, China and South Africa acts collectively. The blame for the temporary failure will be attributed to developed countries? reluctance to phase out domestic support and export subsidies in agriculture. That gives India time to introduce domestic reforms and even reduce duties in manufactured goods. Meanwhile, market access, particularly in service sectors, happens through bilateral agreements, such as the ones with Singapore and Sri Lanka, there being talk of similar agreements with South Korea, China and the United States of America. Compared to the Uruguay Round (1986-94), India is in a relatively happy negotiating position because of three factors ? first, greater economic strength and clout; second, emergence of G-20 and its core as a negotiating force; and third, enhanced in-house negotiating capacity within the commerce ministry, spliced with willingness to tap external expertise. All these are contingent on reforms, which must be maintained, regardless of Hong Kong.

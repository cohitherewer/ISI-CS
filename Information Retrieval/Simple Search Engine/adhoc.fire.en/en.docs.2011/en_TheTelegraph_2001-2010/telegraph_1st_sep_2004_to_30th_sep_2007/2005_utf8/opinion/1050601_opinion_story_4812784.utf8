 Letters to Editor

 Tearing a page

 Sir ? One could understand the Maharashtra government doing away with the dance bars in the name of cleansing the city of sleaze. But the municipal corporation?s eviction drive against book-stalls near Churchgate Station defies all logic (?End of road for book street?, May 31). What the authorities failed to realize is that these tiny stalls, much like the ones in College Street in Calcutta, are an integral part of the city?s heritage. Not just that, they also offered books and other knick-knacks to students and booklovers at throwaway prices in a city where everything else comes at a very steep price. The fact that these displaced vendors can now be employed by the city?s notorious underworld also seems to have escaped their notice. One learns that the city fathers want Mumbai to become another Shanghai. But surely, that can be achieved without paying such a high price.

 Yours faithfully,

 Arvind Kumar Sawant, Mumbai

 No entry

 Sir ? The West Bengal forest department?s decision to ban umbrellas inside Calcutta parks will prevent couples from behaving in an indecent manner in these places (?Love in the parks?, May 26). A visitor to Banabitan, a park situated in Salt Lake, is likely to be greeted with scenes of lovers kissing furtively behind bushes and walls; or youngsters in compromising positions. 

 But why single out Banabitan? Such scandalous behaviour by couples can be seen in other parks of the city as well ? the Victoria Memorial, the Nandan premises, the areas adjoining the Rabindra Sarobar and so on. Some time back, the authorities had declared a similar ban on food items and plastic bags inside parks. Unfortunately, it couldn?t be implemented owing to lax security arrangements. One only hopes that the new rule will not share the fate of that earlier ruling. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shalini Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? The decision to ban umbrellas in parks as a check on amorous young couples is ridiculous to say the least. Presently, eight parks in the city have come under this ban, and the forest department hopes that the ban will help attract more visitors to these places. 

 However, instead of banning umbrellas, the forest department would have been better off tightening surveillance in these parks. For instance, something needs to be done to improve the lighting arrangements in these places. The guards, who are few in number, need to be shuffled from one park to another to ensure that visitors don?t get away with flouting norms by bribing them. 

 What happens in our parks is not surprising, considering what is dished out on our television screens, cinemas and the internet, in the name of entertainment. The youngsters try to live out what they see on screen and end up behaving despicably in public places such as parks. Moreover, one has to remember that the youngsters who indulge in such behaviour often hail from perfectly respectable families, which turn a blind eye to their need for privacy. There is no doubt that the authorities need to restrict all kinds of behaviour that are likely to put off other visitors. But they cannot afford to forget that they have other pressing matters to attend to, and must not get too caught up in trivialities like penalizing lovers who get intimate in public. 

 Yours faithfully,

Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

 Sir ? Risqu? behaviour on the part of lovebirds in public places is commonplace in all Indian cities, not just Calcutta. What is equally worrying, though, is the increasing instances of infidelity and sexual licentiousness on the part of young couples today. Young men and women are not averse to having affairs outside marriage, cheating on their unsuspecting partners in the process. Sadly, true love stories are like fairy-tales, thanks to the unscrupulous behaviour of our youngsters.

 Yours faithfully,

Salil Gewali, Shillong

 Sir ? Now that the forest department authorities have decided to ban umbrellas in parks, where will citizens go in search of some leisure in this stifling heat? Perhaps, the authorities need to think about this one. Isn?t it better to install airconditioners, instead of more lights, before throwing open the park gates to the public?

 Yours faithfully,

Samir Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Dear departed

 Sir ? With the death of Sunil Dutt, India has lost one of its finest actors. Dutt was also an honest politician with a deep-rooted commitment to secularism. Having gone through the trauma of Partition himself, he worked his way up through sheer determination and hard work, never succumbing to undue pressures, political or otherwise. His services towards the betterment of slum-dwellers in his home city, Mumbai, as well as his involvement in AIDS awareness programmes, will be remembered not only by the members of his constituency but by his fans as well. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? Ismail Merchant?s death, so soon after Sunil Dutt?s demise, came as a shock to film-lovers all over India. Merchant was known for his Indo-English films and played a pioneering role in ensuring cross-over cinema got its due in celluloid history. 

 Yours faithfully,

R. Sekar, Angul

 Letters to Editor

 Stop beating about the bush

 Sir ? What is it about our governments that they ignore basic issues and concentrate on frills? Tigers are being steadily poached to extinction in reserved forests in West Bengal and our officials can do nothing to stop it, or pretend they are helpless. But, unfazed, our state forest department is laying out elaborate plans for an ?Old age home for tigers? (May 22). With their specialized knowledge and experience, they surely don?t need reminding that the best thing for the big cats is to let them be. One reason old tigers enter human habitation is that they are no longer fast enough to be able to catch prey. But can anyone deny that encroachments by the ever-increasing human population is eating into the tiger?s habitat? Or worse, that the wood mafia in the Sunderbans is wreaking havoc with the area?s ecological balance and that that is the main reason the tigers can no longer find prey?

 Yours faithfully,

 Ratna Sengupta, Calcutta 

 Right on course

 Sir ? Ashok V. Desai?s ?An unpolluted mind? (May 17) made me marvel at how K.S. Sudarshan ? who is such an inveterate Pakistan-basher and for whom spreading Hinduism is the sole criterion for being a national hero ? remained silent during the five years of the NDA government. I did not find any reference in Sudarshan?s interview to poverty, unemployment, illiteracy, shortage of drinking water, and the lack of healthcare, proper sanitation and shelter. This means that the section of society he represents is not affected by these problems. Sudarshan should know that this section constitutes no more than five per cent of the total population. And not more than five per cent of that five per cent population believes in the ideology of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. And Sudarshan thinks he can evaluate past and present great Indian leaders? The RSS chief is very insistent on the Ram temple. A religious person goes to a temple to seek peace and the blessings of god. But Sudarshan?s priority is to construct the Ram temple even if it is at the cost of a bloodbath. Further, Sudarshan seems to be saying that he wouldn?t even mind a nuclear war, but attacking terrorist training camps in Azad Kashmir is more important. He is of the opinion that Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L.K. Advani should retire because of their old age. What about himself? Is he still a teenager? Why does he not retire first before advising others? With the friends like him, the BJP does not needs enemies.

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Ashok V. Desai has done what intellectuals in this country excel at: rail at the RSS and Hindus. Desai is sarcastic about everything K.S. Sudarshan says. He forgets the social work of RSS and its poverty alleviation efforts. 

 Yours faithfully,

Ramesh Dewan, Chennai

 Sir ? K.S. Sudarshan?s favourite icons are Indira Gandhi and P.V. Narasimha Rao, while his least favourite person is Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Food always tastes better in a stranger?s house. Sudarshan?s grouse is that Vajpayee did nothing to realize the saffronites? core agenda ? the Ram temple, Section 370 and the common civil code. Sudarshan is a law-abiding citizen. He should know that to change or amend the Constitution, a party requires an absolute majority in parliament. Did the RSS help the BJP secure at least a simple majority? Does he expect an autocratic step from a party heading a democratic alliance government? 

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur 

 Letter perfect

 Sir ? There is no use comparing hand-written letters and emails with SMS (?Back to letters?, May 20). Emails are hand-written letters, only written on a machine, instead of by the human hand, in order to save time. SMS is totally different; it is easily accessible, and anyone can use it. To say that SMS is affecting academic writing is to get hold of the wrong end of the stick. SMS has given rise to a new language in this high-technology age, as a result of its accessibility, high mobility and, above all, its user-friendliness.

 Yours faithfully,

Shalini Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? The report, ?Msg: short, swift and soulless? (May 18), fails to explore the many interesting dimensions of the letter-writing versus SMS debate. It merely quotes some people who lament the death of letter-writing, as SMS-fever grips the new generation. But the question is, why has letter-writing become obsolete and why has the habit of writing personal letters gone out of fashion? We are living is an era of haste. The new means of communication, powered by technology, may allow us to send messages quickly but, in the process, they have dealt a body blow to the imagination of people. No one attempts to know how, if at all, the art of writing a letter survives in email communication. 

 But not everything is bad about the new developments. When I feel nostalgic about my girlfriend, who lives in a European city, I can rush an email to her, telling her what I feel. 

 Yours faithfully, 

John Murti, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? India has always endorsed sticking to tradition, at least on pen and paper. While we make much of hand-written letters, teaching the use of technology is often relegated to the back burner. One glaring instance was the way the former Andhra Pradesh chief minister, Chandrababu Naidu, was made the butt of ridicule for giving unprecedented importance to computer literacy. Those who denounce emails and SMS outright should remember that nowadays, many authors too compose their books on the computer. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

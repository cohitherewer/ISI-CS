 Letters to Editor

 Where there?s smoke 

 Sir ? The report, ?Big blot on Bihar on Nasa pollution map?(Jan 30), talks about the alarming levels of pollution in Laloo Prasad Yadav?s state. But the facts mentioned should be taken with a pinch of salt. It is not unusual for the West to train its guns on third world countries like India over its supposed role in the degradation of the environment through the burning of fossil fuels. But if Bihar does have ?an immense wintertime pool of pollution blanketing around 100 million people?, there would have been a large ozone hole over the state by now. Nothing of that sort, however, has been reported so far. The findings may have been a ruse on the part of the United States of America to divert attention from its own role in damaging the environment. One must not forget that the world?s sole superpower has not signed on the dotted line of the Kyoto Protocol yet.

 Yours faithfully,

Jinu Mathew, Calcutta

 Heroes or villains?

 Sir ? Ramachandra Guha?s understanding of Indian politics is rather sketchy (?Old habits die hard?, Jan 22). Or else he is seriously short of things to write about. The cult of ?bhakti?, as Guha puts it, might be prevalent in Indian politics, but it has never led to the rise of a dictator. This is because no party or politician has been able to draw away the electorate from democracy. The Emergency was a rare exception and it was not, as Guha says, a product of bhakti. 

 Guha?s comparison of Indian politics with that of the erstwhile Soviet Union is flimsy as well. The same goes for his contention that the West is largely free of sycophancy. ?Loyalty to the leader in person rather than to his government?s policies? is a phrase which may be used to describe Indira Gandhi?s legacy and explain George W. Bush?s re-election equally well. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sourav Sengupta, Durgapur

 Sir ? Hero worship is deeply entrenched in the Indian psyche. So why should we blame our leaders for enjoying the adulation they receive? In the past, praise was heaped on anyone who achieved success ? be it in politics, literature or art. During the freedom movement, every other leader used to be bestowed with a title by their followers. The situation is much the same today. Guha is right in saying that sycophancy is harmful to democracy. But can we really blame the politicians alone for this state of affairs?

 Yours faithfully,

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta 

 Sir ? A mature democracy should have room for praise as well as for criticism. Such praise should not be at the expense of the truth though. Otherwise, the culture of sycophancy would lead the nation to its ruin, as has been the case with India. Leaders like Mayavati and Laloo Prasad Yadav have consolidated Indira Gandhi?s legacy of the personality cult in Indian politics. Even the left, with its rational and principled approach, has found it difficult to go against the grain. Sycophancy, coupled with falling ethical and moral standards, is a reality in contemporary politics. The onus of changing this reality lies with the youth which needs to be supported in its endeavour to cleanse Indian politics of corruption.

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad 

 Sir ? India is often described as one of the world?s largest democracies. But how democratic is our country in reality? If India followed democratic principles faithfully, then how does one explain the predominance of politicians like Laloo Prasad Yadav, Mulayam Singh Yadav, J. Jayalalithaa and Bal Thackeray? The Congress is no better ? it refuses to break its ties with the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty. If the party revolved around Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi in the past, it is now the turn of the Sonias and the Priyankas to call the shots. Things have, in fact, taken a turn for the worse ? Congressmen recently fell over themselves to fete Sonia on her birthday. But very few remembered to pay homage to Subhash Chandra Bose on his birthday, January 23. 

 In this situation, the least our leaders can do is stop thumping their chests about India being a successful democracy at international forums. They only make a laughing stock of the country in the rest of the world.

 Yours faithfully,

Kajal Chatterjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? Building a democratic India was always going to be a difficult task. From the very beginning, independent India placed more importance on caste and kin affiliations than on values like transparency and merit. The Nehruvian years ? marked by a socialist model ? were an exception to this though. But the principles followed by Nehru were undone by his daughter who nurtured sycophants. Indira Gandhi?s misdeeds continue to inspire regional satraps like Mayavati and Jayalalithaa even today. The Westminster model of parliamentary democracy will only be successful in India if our politicians start putting the country before themselves. 

 Yours faithfully,

Niloy Sinha, Murshidabad

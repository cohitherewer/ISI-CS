 Unhoused, vague and uncertain

Dispatches from the people?s war in Nepal (Pluto 

and Insight, ?14.99) by Li Onesto is an intimate, but analytical, chronicle 

of a journalist?s travels in the guerrilla zones of Nepal in the spring of 1999. 

Onesto claims to be the first foreign journalist to be given such access by the 

Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) to write an ?inside human story? of the revolution. 

?I stayed in villages where poor farmers provided food and shelter. I traveled 

and lived with members of the People?s Army and interviewed political and military 

leaders, guerrilla fighters, relatives of those killed in the war, and villagers 

in areas under Maoist control. I embarked on this three-month journey with the 

aim of capturing the passion, voices, and the faces of the peasants who are waging 

what they call a ?People?s War?.? The photograph shows women militia members in 

Rolpa.

In that sense you touched it amp; unquiet waters 

(Sahitya Akademi, Rs 90) by Ketaki Kushari Dyson and Lakshmi Kannan 

respectively collects recent poems by two poets, as part of the Akademi?s 

Golden Jubilee efforts to ?project Indian poetry in English by women writers, 

so that the larger reading public becomes aware of their nuanced sensitivity and 

the infinite variety of their concerns?. Dyson?s ?Totally Multicultural? recasts 

Auden?s ?Time will say nothing?: ??I am but ashes? ? you say with a yogi?s glow./ 

Listen, not only you, but I?ll be ashes one day;/ if I knew when, I would certainly 

let you know.? Kannan?s forte is ?the short, striking lyric, marked by a meditative 

vein?: ?She remained un-housed/ vague and uncertain/ in having lost/ what she 

had never possessed.?

The rhetoric of english india (Penguin, 

Rs 295) by Sara Suleri challenges the obsession with Otherness that 

is a trademark of colonial studies. Instead of observing a strict separation between 

works by Western and non-Western writers and between ruling and subject races, 

Suleri reconstructs a narrative in which English and Indian idioms play with, 

and against, each other. By studying a wide range of materials from the writings 

of Burke to 19th-century women?s travelogues, to the fiction of Kipling, Forster, 

Naipaul and Rushdie, Suleri reveals the complicity that always operates in colonial 

literature.

 FRESH START

 The rise and fall of leaders are not necessarily the most significant aspect of electoral verdicts. Elections, after all, are supposed to be battles over policies. But in Bihar, the fall of Mr Lalu Prasad makes the verdict a watershed in the state?s recent political history. Not that the end of the 15-year reign of Mr Prasad and his wife, Ms Rabri Devi, has come as a surprise. Most pollsters had predicted it, even if they failed to correctly guess the margin of victory for the National Democratic Alliance led by Mr Nitish Kumar. Even in the elections in February, the Biharis put Mr Prasad on notice. Yet, the man rose in Bihar?s politics on the crest of a great hope. He symbolized the first-ever political upsurge of the backward classes, whose hopes and anguishes never found a political voice. But, as happens with many small-time leaders, once in power, he personified a great betrayal. He used the popular will for the most brazen self-aggrandizements. Bihar became a byword for abject poverty, the vilest forms of politics, rampant corruption and total lawlessness. 

 All this should give Mr Kumar an idea of what odds he is up against. He has a mandate to return Bihar to the sane society. He has to cleanse the system of the festering wounds that the previous regime has left behind. Almost every section of the society needs a drastic overhaul, but he must begin with the civic and police administration. However, before he does anything else, Mr Kumar has to convince the people that it is possible to live safely and peacefully in Bihar. The Maoist rebels are a grave threat to life in the state; but the people are just as afraid of scores of its politicians. Some of these politicians are there even in Mr Kumar?s own party, the Janata Dal (United), and among the NDA?s other partners. The other big challenge before Bihar?s new leader is to keep its caste politics in check and not to let it sabotage the rule of law. In fact, the election results make a caste backlash a distinct possibility. It would be suicidal for Mr Kumar to allow this to happen. How he tackles this threat would be his first crucial test. Nobody expects him to quickly transform Bihar into a state that is all shine and no stink. But the least he must do is stop the state?s dangerous drift. 

 It is too early to say what impact the Bihar verdict may have on national politics. Coming a day ahead of parliament?s winter session, it surely adds to the discomfiture of the United Progressive Alliance government. A beleaguered Manmohan Singh government has much to defend itself against. The Volcker report and the Iran vote could make it a testing time for the prime minister. The Supreme Court?s final verdict in the case relating to the dissolution of the Bihar assembly last May is also unlikely to bring any cheer to the government. The verdict in Bihar would add to the UPA?s winter chill.

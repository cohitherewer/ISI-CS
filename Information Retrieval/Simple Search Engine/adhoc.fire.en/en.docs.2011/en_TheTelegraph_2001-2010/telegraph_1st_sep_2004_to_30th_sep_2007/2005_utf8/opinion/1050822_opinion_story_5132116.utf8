 SCRAP SALE

 Are strategic sales always non-transparent? There have been disputes about asset valuation, bidding processes, reserve prices and post-closure adjustment claims. But this is not the same as arguing that there cannot be greater safeguards to improve transparency. Even if strategic sales are relatively non-transparent compared to public offers, they yield higher values, because premium is paid for control. But again, public offers may make the political economy easier to handle. One ought to be flexible about strategic sales and public offers. The mode should vary from company to company and sector to sector. But this does not always happen and we are stuck with the Bible of the National Common Minimum Programme, which dispenses with strategic sales. Or so the finance minister would have us think. But the NCMP mentions transparency, raising resources from the capital market, non-privatization of profit-making public sector units and sale of chronically loss-making ones. The expression strategic sale is not used at all. But now the proposed strategic sale of 13 profit-making PSUs is off. The finance minister says that the decision to scrap strategic sales was taken in February 2005.

 This may be the NCMP line for profit-making PSUs. But nowhere does the NCMP prohibit privatization and strategic sales for loss-making PSUs. Even if privatization is dead, disinvestment may survive. The Chidambaram argument about minority sales through public offers would have been more convincing had there been movement on Bhel. Not only has there been no headway with the left, the proposal to reduce equity in public sector banks from 51 per cent to 33 per cent has also been dropped. The reference to the Supreme Court judgment is verbal legerdemain, since all public sector banks have not been set up through the Consolidated Fund of India. There may be different definitions of reform, but privatization/ disinvestment remains an integral part. Hence, it is valid to argue that the Central government has bid adieu to liberalization. In terms of mindsets, the United Progressive Alliance wants everyone to work for the government. The rural employment guarantee bill is one manifestation. And the resource crunch will remain. Not only will the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act be forgotten, the opportunity costs of missed investments in social and physical infrastructure will be considerable.

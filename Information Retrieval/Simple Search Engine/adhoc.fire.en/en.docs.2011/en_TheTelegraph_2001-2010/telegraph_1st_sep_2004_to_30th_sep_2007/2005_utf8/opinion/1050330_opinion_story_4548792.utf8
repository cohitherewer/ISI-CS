 UNACCEPTABLE

 If there is one thing that is utterly incompatible with a liberal education it is the vision of a darogah. This point acquires an edge because two learned men with impeccable liberal credentials occupy two of the most important jobs in the country. Mr Manmohan Singh, the prime minister of India, has degrees from both Cambridge and Oxford; and Mr K. Natwar Singh, the minister for external affairs, is an alumnus of the university by the river Cam. Yet under their aegis, a leading Bengali writer from Bangladesh, Ms Taslima Nasreen, who is a fugitive from the forces of Islamic fundamentalism, has been denied the right to be a long-term resident of India. Ms Nasreen?s application to be a citizen of India was based on a very simple premise. The Bengali language and Bengali culture are indispensable to her creativity. India is the only country, other than the country of her origin, which can provide the conditions necessary to water the roots of her writing. It is not unreasonable to assume that any civilized government, which received such an application from a writer who is not a threat to security and to law and order, would respond positively to the appeal for asylum. But the government of India has responded by giving Ms Nasreen a visa for six months. There can only be anguish at this decision. The prime minister and the foreign minister may not have been directly responsible for this bizarre decision, but they have to share in the ignominy. Both of them would do well to remember the glorious record that Britain, the country in which they were educated, has in providing asylum to writers, intellectuals and politicians fleeing from tyranny and fanaticism.

 The pain caused to most liberal-minded people by the treatment meted out to Ms Nasreen is aggravated by the suspicion that her case is being used as a bargaining counter by the government of India in its dealings with Bangladesh. It is believed that the ministry for external affairs has linked its position on Ms Nasreen?s request for citizenship to what Bangladesh does to the leader of the United Liberation Front of Asom, Mr Anup Chetia. If this allegation is not apocryphal, then the external affairs ministry has equated an eminent writer to a terrorist. In a similar vein, the West Bengal government is reported to have reservations about Ms Nasreen?s application for citizenship since support to it can alienate Muslim opinion in the state. It is a measure of the prevailing levels of ethics and culture in India that a writer is made a pawn on the political chessboard.

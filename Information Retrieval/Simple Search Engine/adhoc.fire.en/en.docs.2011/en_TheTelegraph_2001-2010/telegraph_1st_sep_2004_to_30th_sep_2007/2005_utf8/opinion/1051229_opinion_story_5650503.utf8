 Letters to Editor

 Rallying point

 Sir ? Environmental issues have never been a priority for any political party in India. NGOs and responsible citizens had to move court not so long ago to save Calcutta?s wetlands. If the right to hold political rallies is considered a fundamental right in a democracy, then appropriate infrastructure should be created so that this right can be exercised. To utilize existing infrastructure, rallies might be conveniently held in stadiums, such as at Salt Lake or Rabindra Sarobar, which can hold a large number of people and have built-in infrastructure such as toilets and stalls. As in other cities around the world, a permanent venue should be created in Calcutta to cater to commercial fairs and the like. The Maidan should be kept free of fairs and political rallies. At the same time, attempts should be made to add to the verdure of the Maidan and develop it along the lines of London?s Hyde Park or New York?s Central Park. Political parties should be fined for littering the greens and the proceeds should be used for the maintenance and beautification of the Maidan. Perhaps it is time for the Green Bench to become more proactive. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bhaskar Majumdar, Kuwait

 Sir ? The statement of the Union defence minister, Pranab Mukherjee, that the Brigade Parade Grounds is meant for rallies, does not augur well for the health of the city (?Brigade is for rallies: Pranab?, Dec 27). All the efforts to restore the Maidan to its former glory will come to naught if the Brigade Parade Grounds are thrown open to rallies. And it is quite likely that it will be, now that the defence minister has found a willing ally in the West Bengal chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. Once the precedent is set, it is only a matter of time before every other political party starts organizing meetings at the Brigade. When it comes to acting irresponsibly and flouting court orders, Indian politicians remain unparalleled.

 Yours faithfully,

Swayambhu Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? The Indian army has been forced to beat a humiliating retreat (?Army surrenders Brigade to rally?, Dec 22)! That the Union government is in effect run by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) has again been proved by the army?s forced volte face in allowing the CPI(M)-backed coordination committee of state government employees and associations to hold a rally at the Brigade Parade Grounds on December 28. The Maidan acts as the city?s lungs. The high court has on several occasions ruled out the possibility of holding rallies and fairs there. But that has not deterred our leaders. Not only has the army been humiliated in this instance, so have the people of the city who face endless trouble when the traffic comes to a halt every time there is a rally on a working day. 

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Das Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is unfortunate to find that a veteran communist politician such as Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is complicit in the violation of rules to help an organization backed by his party. The coordination committee had not obtained the prior approval of the army before deciding to hold its rally at Brigade. Thus it had undermined the authority of the army and deserved to have its rally scrapped in the first place. The Maidan is under the army?s jurisdiction, and therefore, its wishes should have been granted adequate importance. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 Sir ? The Indian army has fought and won many valiant battles in rough terrains and inclement weather. But while the deserts of Rajasthan and the snows of Siachen could not vanquish them, the plains of Calcutta have managed to do that. In India, people champion environmental issues only when they have a personal agenda, be it to hog media limelight or to gain political advantage. The commitment of Indians ? politicians and celebrities in particular ? to the cause is always suspect. Otherwise, how can Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who raised a hue and cry over the death of two bear cubs in North Bengal only a few days back, be instrumental in coercing the army to allow the Brigade rally, knowing full well the environmental mess this would entail? We ought to feel sad for the squatters of the Rabindra Sarobar lakes who have been evicted in the name of protecting the environment. If only they had the same backing as the state coordination committee, they might have averted the eviction. 

 Yours faithfully,

Chameli Pal, Calcutta

 Sir ? The state government employees? organization is in no way entitled to celebrate its golden jubilee at the Brigade Parade Grounds at the cost of disrupting the normal life of the city. By supporting the rally, the chief minister is indirectly condoning the disruption and chaos that rallies inevitably cause. He has even tried to find precedents in support of his decision and has dropped names as big as Jawaharlal Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi, who addressed rallies at the Brigade Parade Grounds. This only gives a bathetic effect to this shameful instance of political manipulation.

 Yours faithfully,

Pradip Chowdhury, Calcutta

 Sir ? When the saner citizens of the metropolis are trying to keep the Maidan free from pollution, Pranab Mukherjee?s declaration that ?Brigade is for rallies? is deplorable. The defence minister cannot be unaware of the havoc that rallies wreak on the Maidan, nor is he ignorant that rallies are merely muscle-flexing exercises for politicians. Most participants in the rallies are forced recruits. Before asking the army to withdraw its objections to the coordination committee?s December 28 rally, maybe Mukherjee should have consulted a few of Calcutta?s eminent citizens and environmentalists who have no political axe to grind in the matter.

 Yours faithfully,

P.K. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

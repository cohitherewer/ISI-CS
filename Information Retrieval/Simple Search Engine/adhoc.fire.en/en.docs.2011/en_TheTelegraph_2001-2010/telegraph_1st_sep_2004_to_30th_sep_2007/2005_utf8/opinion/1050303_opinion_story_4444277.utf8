 LAZY, GULLIBLE AND CLUELESS

 Gouri Chatterjee

 It is easy to blame the media, it?s the sort of week when we, with heads hanging down, are practically asking for it.

 We are so gullible ? we accept unquestioningly tall claims about topping NASA tests and invitations to the Oscars (this paper being a rare exception), so eager are we for feel-good stories.

 We are too lazy ? we don?t even bother to go to websites to check out the facts. We are also ignorant ? clueless about the ways of NASA and the Academy of Motion Pictures despite our fixation with both. 

 Above all, we are very much a part of the great bazaar that is India today. A market that decrees that an international mark is the only measure of success and draws into its maw both ?the most beautiful woman in the world? and a village lad from a backward district in UP.

 There is something quite tragic in the desperation of the reigning queen of Bollywood to break into Hollywood and the delusional pronouncements of a village schoolmaster?s son who still insists he sat for a test in Oxford, and the ?certificate? signed by Cin K. Kif was really given to him by former NASA administrator Sean O?Keefe. (Remember, even the nation?s first citizen didn?t deny coming 7th in a non-existent exam until NASA punctured the balloon, even as the hapless Saurabh Singh sat in the Rashtrapati Bhavan for a scheduled audience with the President.)

 The Indian dream is rapidly turning into a nightmare, but all one hears about is what the media did wrong. Sure, they feed our society?s frenzy over all things foreign, and profit by it too, no doubt muddying the waters further. But blaming the media alone ? that?s too easy a way out. Ash may sail through, but the Saurabh Singhs need help fast. It was not an indolent press that set him down the slippery slope of success.

 The hidden camera

 One thing you have to hand to Indians. They don?t go in for prurience for the sake of prurience. They didn?t when M.O. Mathai tried to sully the image of the country?s first prime minister with salacious gossip, they hurriedly looked away when sordid photographs of Congress leader Jagjivan Ram?s son was published in Maneka Gandhi?s magazine, they have barely taken note of India TV?s disgusting ?expos?? last Sunday of four Bihar politicians caught in flagrante delicto on hidden camera with women who are, presumably, not their wives.

 The tapes are pretty revealing and revolting. But what they do not tell us is what these men?s antics behind closed doors have to do with their public lives. What public money have they squandered, what trust did they violate?

 India TV claims it has shown this pornography in the name of news only to expose the hypocrisy of politicians and their sleazy private lives so that people can know who they are voting for.

 It is unlikely that even their mothers see these two-bit office-seekers as paragons of virtue. The whole exercise seems so pointless that it reeks of lewd titillation. So much so that even the Hindi papers have chosen to ignore such succulent bait.

 The hidden camera has become a staple of Indian journalism ever since Tehelka used it to show a leader casually accepting a bribe. Many good stories have followed. But no one simply secreted a camera into a room in the hope of trapping someone some day, the only way the India TV expos? could have happened (unless the channel did more to encourage its victims to perform). That?s hardly the stuff of investigative journalism. Rather, it may raise ? legitimately ? demands for stricter regulation in the use of hidden cameras, and where would we be then?

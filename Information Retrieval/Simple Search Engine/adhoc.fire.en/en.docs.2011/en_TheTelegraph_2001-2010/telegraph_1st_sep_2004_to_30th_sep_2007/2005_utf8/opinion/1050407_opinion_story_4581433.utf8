 ANOTHER WAY TO GO 

 Gouri Chatterjee

 August 7, 1978: A seven-line paragraph tucked away near the bottom of the front page of Anandabazar Patrika announces the death of Pope Paul VI in Rome. That is as much notice the death of a pope merits in the most read paper of the city where Mother Teresa is already a tourist attraction (she wins the Nobel Prize next year).

 October 1, 1978: It is Mahalaya but the city is still reeling from devastating floods. Anandabazar cannot spare the space to print the news of the sudden death of Pope John Paul I 33 days after coronation.

 April 4, 2005: A large colour photograph of Pope John Paul II lying in state in St Peter?s Basilica dominates the top half of Anandabazar?s page 1. The media everywhere are giving unto the papacy what the ?people?s pope? gave unto them.

 The mass media as much as the mass were this pope?s primary weapons in his drive to reinvent the image of the Catholic Church. A former actor and playwright, John Paul realized that in the end what most people remembered were images, not words. He let the cameras roll.

 He was the first pope to grant a television interview, the first to open up the Vatican to the world press. Indeed, one of his legacies is the Vatican?s own press operation, with news agencies, daily papers, radio and TV networks that not only kept the world posted on the papacy but also released photographs of John Paul in shirt sleeves, skiing, walking in the hills, that is, the man.

 His constant peregrinations (he travelled more miles and to more countries than all of his predecessors combined) provided endless photo opportunities that did not go to waste. ?Tears came to my eyes when I saw the Holy Father kneel in front of Mahatma Gandhi?s samadhi and pray for a few minutes,? reads a letter to the editor in a Delhi paper. Similar remembrances have flooded the world media.

 No wonder a papabile (someone with pope-potential) today has to be more than knowledgeable and holy. Cardinal Oscar Rodriguez of Honduras would represent a powerful voice for Latin America, but ?his main drawback is that he is seen as being hostile to the press,? says one report. Cardinal Angelo Scola, the patriarch of Venice, on the other hand, is ?a media-savvy intellectual who has written about bioethics, one of the immediate issues facing the next pope.? But, it can be different. Sister Nirmala proved that. 

 Role shift

 There are several examples of journalists metamorphosing into filmmakers (Hollywood great Billy Wilder to maverick Michael Moore to our very own Subrata Sen). But there are no known cases of a filmmaker mutating into a journalist ? and thank god for small mercies. The example of Goutam Ghose playing one in his documentary on Jyoti Basu is anything but inspiring. The result is neither a meaningful cinematic experience nor worthwhile journalism. An endless question-answer session with both Basu and Ghose sitting stiffly across a table does not a film make. And softball questions based on a questionnaire approved beforehand by the grand old man of Bengal are hardly the stuff of journalism. In the end, a journalist, as much as a filmmaker, tells a story that has something new to say. In Jyoti Basur Sange, Ghose has none.

 Delayed bells

 Come Saturday, an ageing Prince and his mature fianc?e may be married. Or maybe not. Whatever happens, some people will make money. Bookmakers are taking bets on the next catastrophe to hit the Charles-Camilla wedding. The odds for a fed-up Camilla not turning up is 33-1 but that of the royal correspondent the prince branded ?bloody people? and ?so awful? last week interrupting and halting the ceremony is 500-1. Journalists, it seems, love lovers.

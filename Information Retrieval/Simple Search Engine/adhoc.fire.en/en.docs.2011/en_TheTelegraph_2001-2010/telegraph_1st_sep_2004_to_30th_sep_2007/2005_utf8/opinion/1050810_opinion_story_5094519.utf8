 GIVE THEM A FAIR DEAL

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the communique issued by the G8 nations at Gleneagles, July 8

 To support African efforts to increase South-South trade and regional integration, to improve specialization and create more jobs and prosperity;

 d. To improve the utilization of our preference schemes by ensuring that rules (particularly rules of origin) are transparent and simple to follow and do not inadvertently preclude eligible developing countries from taking advantage of those schemes. We support the efforts underway by the World Bank and others to address concerns regarding trade preference erosion. We further agree to report back on progress to future presidencies.

 23. Infrastructure and supply-side weaknesses often prevent the poorest countries from exploiting their trading opportuni-ties and need to be addressed. To boost growth, attract new investment and contribute to building Africa?s capacity to trade we will:

 a. Continue our work to build an international infrastructure consortium involving the African Union, New Partnership for Africa?s Development, Word Bank and African Development Bank, recognized by NEPAD as the lead infrastructure agency, to facilitate infrastructure investment, including in cross-border infrastructure, in Africa. This should achieve more effective and larger-scale infrastructure activity to back Africa?s priorities, and to identify and overcome project development, financing, and business environment constraints, recognizing the comparative advantages of different donors and the private sector.

 b. Support investment, enterprise development and innovation, for example through support to the AU/NEPAD Investment Climate Facility, the Enhanced Private Sector Assistance with the AFDB, and other appropriate institutions, to invest in small and medium-size enterprises and microfinance, and through actions by the relevant International Financial Institutions and African governments to increase access to financial services through increased partnerships between commercial banks and micro-finance institutions and African governments, including through support for diversification of financial services available to the poor and effective use of remittance.

 c. Support a comprehensive set of actions to raise agricultural productivity, strengthen urban-rural linkages and empower the poor, based on national initiatives and in cooperation with the AU/NEPAD Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme and other African initiatives.

 d. Encourage best practice in responsible investment through African private sector networks, including support the United Nations Global Compact.

 e. Welcome the growing market for fair-trade goods and their positive effect in supporting livelihoods and increasing public awareness of the positive role of trade in development.

 f. Support youth employment in Africa for both men and women, including vocational education and training relevant to market demands.

 CONCLUDED

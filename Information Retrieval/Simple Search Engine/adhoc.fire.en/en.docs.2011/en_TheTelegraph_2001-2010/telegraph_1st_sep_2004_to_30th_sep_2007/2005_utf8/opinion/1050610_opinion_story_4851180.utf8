 ELEGY TO THE BIG CAT

 The re-publication of Kailash Sankhala?s TIGER!: THE STORY OF THE INDIAN TIGER (Natraj, Rs 450) comes at a strategic moment, just as the revelations about the steadily decreasing numbers of tigers in sanctuaries all over the country has re-kindled popular interest in them. There is an added poignancy in that Sankhala was the man who, as head of Project Tiger from 1972-80, is credited with having ?saved? the tiger from extinction. Ironically, it was at Sariska that Sankhala, as as a callow forest officer, shot and killed a tiger ? and turned conservationist in remorse. Therefore, it is rather odd that the publishers have neglected to include an introduction or an addendum to bring the story up to date. For the rest, this is a competent guide to the Indian tiger ? its methods of hunting, courtship and even its expressions. The photographs are disappointing.

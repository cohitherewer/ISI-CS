 Letters to Editor

 Spot the corruption

 Sir ? Ashok Mitra comes down heavily on the finance minister, his wife, the Congress and the left for being complicit in the alleged corruption involving the Central Board of Direct Taxes (?Case of the lawyer wife?, Sept 19). Some years ago, Mitra, in an interview to the Puja annual of Ganashakti, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) mouthpiece, confessed that during his tenure as the state finance minister, funds were liberally released from the state exchequer for organising mahamichhils and other party events. What was this but rank corruption? Nalini Chidambaram has returned her fees and the entire nation has watched her husband?s explanation in parliament. Has the CPI(M) ever apologized for siphoning off public money for party activities? Isn?t there an adage that people living in glass houses should not throw stones at others? 

 Mitra also attributes the absence of leftist protest on the Chidambaram issue to the left?s fear of a saffron resurgence. But the rise of the Bharatiya Janata Party in the Nineties can be explained in terms of the failure of the left. The left failed to occupy the space vacated by the Congress in the late Eighties. It was the rise of the middle classes ? while the left could not mobilize the working classes ? during this period which accounts for the ascendancy of the BJP.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? It is mistaken to think a minister?s wife cannot be engaged as a counsel by his own ministry even though she might be eminently suitable. Ashok Mitra also does not consider certain facts. Nalini Chidambaram, an eminent lawyer, has been appointed as counsel on earlier occasions by the income tax department. Another important point is that the appointment was made by the commissioner or the chairman of the CBDT, who are top ranking officers, duly authorized to make such appointments on merit without informing or seeking the approval of the minister. Simply because she happens to be the minister?s wife, Nalini Chidambaram cannot be debarred from lending her expert services for a price to the government in public interest. How can the minister be arraigned for favouritism or nepotism in that case? 

 In this context the minister?s observation that had he the ?slightest intimation? that his wife was going to be so appointed, he would have nipped the plan in the bud is not only uncalled for but also smacks of male chauvinism. Either as minister or as husband, Chidambaram had no business interfering in his wife?s professional functions. This is a larger issue, which feminists need to discuss.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? I have always had the deepest regard for Ashok Mitra. But I was disappointed to read his views on the ?Case of the lawyer wife?. This is the 21st century and it is actually possible for a woman to be both a lawyer or independent professional and a wife. Nalini Chidambaram has been a lawyer for 38 years. She was the first woman senior standing counsel from the Madras bar and had been senior counsel for the income tax department for 17 years before she opted for private practice. Her appointment by the income tax department was not a favour but an acknowledgment of her professional competence. 

 P. Chidambaram was among the most affluent contenders in the parliamentary elections. The ?sumptuous? amount of Rs 1 lakh got from the alleged ?act of nepotism? would hardly be a significant addition to the Chidambaram household. 

 What was more disturbing was Mitra?s suggestion that the left should have made political capital of the incident. Why? Why can?t economic policies and political ideologies be debated in the appropriate forum? Why should a non-issue be used to settle political scores? Mitra thinks that the left compromised with corruption. To me it appears that the left acted maturely for once. They knew from the facts that whatever else it may be, it certainly was not a case of corruption.

 I wonder what Mitra would have said if Nalini Chidambaram fought cases against the finance ministry, ? la Cherie Blair? 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Once and for all, there is no relation between economic liberalization and surrendering of a nation?s sovereignty. If India sells textiles to Europe throwing the latter?s industry into turmoil, is the former somehow politically subjugating it? No, because Europe can export capital goods to us, for instance. For Ashok Mitra?s information, this is the whole concept of inter-dependence.

 Second, if foreign companies open factories in India employing erstwhile-unemployed Indians, it increases the incentive for domestic companies to become more competitive and in the process, expand to acquire economies of scale and hire more workers. 

 Third, the left is not exactly the epitome of anti-corruption. Fourth, it is debatable whether a strife-torn BJP would be able to come to power if the left ceases to compromise on its morals and causes the UPA government to fall. The reason why the comrades are not pulling the string is because mid-term elections could pave the way for a Congress-majority government. That could deny our comrades their little place in the sun.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? It is not as if Nalini Chidambaram accepted a brief from a private client and then extracted or tried to extract any undue benefit for her client from the government by taking advantage of her relationship with the finance minister of India. Nor was there any dereliction of duty on her part. Therefore, it is not understandable why the finance minister should feel so apologetic about his wife?s appointment to represent the CBDT before the high Court. People suffering from paranoia can be left to seek their own remedy. 

 Yours faithfully,

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta

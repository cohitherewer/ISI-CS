 Letters to Editor

 A cold welcome

 Sir ? The fact that the media did not make much of a Kurd becoming Iraq?s new president is surprising. Is it not significant that a man who belongs to a community which was identified as part of Saddam Husseins final solution is now the president of the dictator?s former domain? The media?s disinterest in Jalal Talabani can be explained by the fact that it was kept busy by the size of the late pope?s shoe or Michael Jackson?s stack of adult magazines. Or do they think that the invasion of Iraq was not a bad idea after all?

 Yours faithfully,

 Miguel A. Guanipa, Massachusetts, US

 Breach of trust

 Sir ? The manner in which an unscrupulous bank manager almost cheated Dipankar Dasgupta of Rs 80,000 was shocking (?Shifting banks of trust?, April 12). Such instances of perfidy on the part of bank officials has become common in India. The banking sector is extremely competitive here, and unlike in the West, account holders are not protected adequately by the law. This makes it easier for banks and credit-card companies to deceive them.

 Nonetheless, Dasgupta?s criticism of the free market on the basis of one untoward incident is a little harsh. Insurance companies often make dubious promises of risk-free returns above existing market rates. This makes it all the more necessary that one read the fine print before signing on the dotted line. Dasgupta did not do that. However, his suggestion that we institute a system to monitor the ?constabulary? under which market economies operate is well taken, especially with incidents of cheating on the rise. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sekhar Basu Mallik, Calcutta

 Sir ? Dipankar Dasgupta has used an isolated incident to make sweeping generalizations about the market economy. First, a market economy creates a dynamic society in which companies compete to deliver better results. In a free market, a consumer can choose from a wide range of goods and services, and a supplier also endeavours to provide the best at the cheapest possible rates. 

 Problem may arise in a free market when the regulatory framework is not vigilant enough ? there is nothing wrong with the concept per se. Even if we concede Dasgupta?s point about markets breeding corruption, a more relevant criticism could be that in India, it is more expensive to adhere to rules than to break them. Doing business in India is a costly affair, which forces firms to cheat their way out. The real solution lies in making compliance cheaper and evasion expensive.

 Yours faithfully,

Aruni Mukherjee, Coventry, UK

 Sir ? Banks often shove products down customers? throats in the name of client services. Say, a customer walks into a bank wanting to take a loan. Even as he struggles to fill in the complicated forms (which haven?t got any easier from earlier times) and waits for the sanction to come through, he has to contend with endless exhortations to buy insurance policies, credit cards, tax-saving bonds and other financial products the bank may deal in. Our laws need to protect the customer from being pestered by banks, always on the lookout to make the most of a transaction.

 Yours faithfully,

Sudhir Roychowdhury, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir ? The brutal assault on Vivek Sharma by the Trinamool Congress leader, Sanjay Bakshi, and the fact that he got away with it, proves that in India, democracy has become meaningless. It is a shame that men like Bakshi continue to win polls despite their misdeeds.

 Yours faithfully,

K. Chatterjee, Calcutta

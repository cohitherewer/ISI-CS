 MAN WITH A DREAM

 Achiever

 Alexander the Corrector: The Tormented 

 Genius Who Unwrote The Bible

 By Julia Keay, 

 Harper Perennial, pound;8.99

 In the beginning was the Word. 

 But how many people actually know the Word as it is enshrined 

 in the Bible. For those who have taken the study 

 of the Bible seriously and have followed the Authorized 

 Version, the Concordance produced by Alexander Cruden has 

 been an invaluable guide for over two hundred years. But 

 how many know about Alexander Cruden? Julia Keay?s extraordinary 

 biography recreates Cruden?s harrowing, if remarkable, life 

 and also unravels the central mystery of his life. 

 Cruden was born in 1699 in Aberdeen and was educated at the local grammar school and Marischal College. From a very young age he developed an attachment to the Bible. He did not aspire to be an original thinker. As Keay writes, ?He knew he would never be a great theologian, or even a truly great scholar. His strength lay in his familiarity with the Bible, and his close attention to every word it contained as unquestionably the Word of God.? His life was marked by piety but in 1720, he was locked up in the Toolbooth, Aberdeen?s prison. The official story was that Cruden had fallen in love with the daughter of a clergyman who had rejected him. This snub had caused the suitor ?to use such outrageous attempts to obtain an interview with the object of his affections that obliged his friends to send him to a place of confinement.?? Julia Keay is positive on the basis of all documentation that there was nothing wrong with Cruden?s mind, as indeed subsequent events were to prove.

 It is not known how long Cruden spent in prison but in 1724, he moved to London where he took up employment as a proof reader or, in the jargon of the time, a ?corrector of the press?. Despite the hardship, he never lost sight of his dream to produce a Concordance of the Bible. ?A Concordance,? Cruden would explain to those who were interested, ?is a Dictionary, or an Index to the Bible, wherein all the words used through the Inspired Writings are arranged alphabetically, and the various places where they occur are referred to, to assist us in finding out passages, and comparing the several significations of the same word.? The project appears mindboggling when one thinks of it being accomplished by a single individual in an age which had not even dreamt of the computer. But Cruden completed it on his own in his dingy lodgings, working by candle light on small pieces of paper. It took him 13 years to finish. The scale of his achievement can be gauged by the simple fact that the Authorized Version is supposed to be 774,746 words long. Cruden?s Concordance runs to roughly 2,370,000 words.

 This incredible and magnificent achievement did not bring Cruden immediate fame and recognition. On the contrary, a vile conspiracy landed him again in an asylum. He fought to retain his sanity and to win back his dignity. Fame and recognition came to him late in life. Keay describes Cruden?s work in detail and tells the story of his many misfortunes with poignance. It is a splendid biography of a man who never quite got his dues in his life and even from posterity.

 What of the mystery? From a telling clue in Cruden?s will, Keay works backwards to reveal how a powerful family of Aberdeen, in order to hide a scandal concerning incest, had conspired to make Cruden into a madman because he knew the truth. Cruden did not ever reveal what he knew. He knew his Bible and was thus convinced that the meek, like him, would inherit the earth.

 Thanks to Julia Keay, he can claim his inheritance.

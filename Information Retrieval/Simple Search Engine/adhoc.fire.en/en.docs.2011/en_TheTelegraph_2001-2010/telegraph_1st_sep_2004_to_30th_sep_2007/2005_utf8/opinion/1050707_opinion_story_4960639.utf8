 ROCK BOTTOM

 A crisis is always a good test of character. Tuesday morning?s attempted attack on the Ramjanmabhoomi complex posed a challenge to a section of India?s political class. The challenge was not to see the assault through a religious prism, but to view it as a singular act of terror. The sangh parivar, which includes the Bharatiya Janata Party, has failed this test. The leaders of the sangh parivar refused to see the incident as something more than an attack on a Hindu place of worship. From this crude pandering of their own constituency, they moved on to score points against their political opponents. In other words, their response was sectarian and divisive, and had the potential of inciting violence. This kind of reaction is par for the course for an organization like the Vishwa Hindu Parishad or the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, but it is shocking when leaders of the BJP get themselves tarred by the same fundamentalist brush. The BJP, since it first tasted power at the Centre, has been trying to bring itself more into the mainstream of Indian politics by attempting to shed its Hindu fundamentalist image. The process has not been without hiccups and without lapses; a shift, however, had been discernible. But the responses articulated by the BJP leadership on Tuesday, including Mr L.K. Advani, demonstrate that in a crisis the party returns to its Hindu womb.

 What Ayodhya witnessed on Tuesday morning was an act of terror. Terrorism is its own religion. It was an attack not just on a temple complex but also on India?s sovereignty and on India?s secular culture. This attack did not succeed. Pride thus overwhelmed the initial fear that terror had inevitably produced. The sangh parivar refused to recognize these elements and could only think of the religious community it thinks it represents. It refused to do so perhaps because it cannot accept that its own act of terror on the same spot in December 1992 was also a similar assault on India?s sovereignty and secular culture. The absence of scruples was also manifest in the BJP?s demand for the resignation of the Union home minister and the home minister of Uttar Pradesh. When parliament was attacked by terrorists in 2001, the BJP was in power. No one, it will behove the BJP leadership to remember, offered to resign. Politics has few ethics, and politicians have even fewer scruples. But that is no reason to scrape the bottom of the moral barrel.

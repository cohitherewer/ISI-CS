 INTERESTING PEOPLE

This above all / Khushwant Singh

 Time to begin

 Some weeks ago, one of our leading weekly magazines made an oblique reference to a sex scandal against a cabinet minister which was causing acute embarrassment to the government. Who could this minister be? I racked my brains going over the ones I knew to see if the cap fitted on any of their heads. I knew one who had been involved with a maid servant and was badly beaten up by her husband. But that was long before he had been elected to parliament and he was not likely to risk making a fool of himself again. I went over the others in turn; some were known to be compulsive womanizers but were careful enough not to take chances of being found out. I consulted my friends in the media. All of them named one man. I could not believe them as I was under the impression that he was so pre-occupied with his work that he had little time to spare, nor the appetite for dalliance. However, it did not effect my high opinion of him: it only made him more human because of his weakness for women.

 Am I indulging in gossip? My late wife used to say that she hated gossip and was only interested in people. To emphasize her point, she put on her glasses and looked seriously concerned about the person being gossiped about. I relish gossip. When someone tells me of the sleazy life of anyone in the public eye, I try to cross-check him by asking others. All of us know of the private and not-so-private lives of our film stars. They are more open about themselves and enjoy being talked about. 

 Politicians, industrialists and pressmen dislike having their peccadilloes become public property. It reduces their credibility in their own circles. Since most gossip is about the money they make or about their sex escapades, they are more concerned about the latter. They are never short of money, but some hanker for more. However, the upper crust of the media, who though not so flushed with money as politicians or industrialists are, make up by extorting fringe benefits like upper class travel facilities, free stay in the best of hotels, free food in the most expensive of restaurants. Their progeny enjoy similar privileges. A friend told me that a few evenings ago, when he was dining in a five-star hotel, a group of youngsters, boys and girls, entered the dining room and ordered bottles of the most expensive French champagne, Blue Label scotch whiskey and snacks. Out of curiosity he asked the manager what their bill was. It came to over Rs 1 lakh. And that was only for starters. 

 The latest addition to my fund of gossip, which is now over two years old, is of a press baron whose pro-tem mistress got pregnant. She refused to have the foetus aborted and had his child. To get rid of her the fellow had to shell out over a crore and provide substantial maintenance for the child he sired. He was lucky being Indian. If this had happened in Europe or America, both he and his lady friend would have found their pictures on the front pages of all tabloids.

 Old and virile

 A man of 94 is standing trial in a Delhi court on charges of raping a 17-year old girl. He has denied the charge and claims he has been falsely implicated because of a dispute with the girl?s family. Although I am only 90, if I were in the shoes of the 94-year-old, even though innocent, I would cheerfully plead guilty and accept the sentence imposed on me with one request, that is I be given 24 hours to set my affairs in order, celebrate my exploit and meet anyone I wanted to. If conceded, I would first call a press conference and tell the media what a man in his 90s can and cannot do with a girl young enough to be his great grand-daughter. I would dodge direct questions fired at me and leave them guessing about how far I got with the girl. Next I would invite representatives of pharmaceutical concerns and tell them that I was willing to reveal the secret of my ability to do what I had been convicted for doing and invite bids to get the highest offer. I know there is a big demand for harmless aphrodisiacs like Viagra and I would take in plenty of dough to be able to live in comfort in any Indian jail where you get everything you want if you have the money to bribe the jail staff. And finally, I would write an application to the Guinness Book of Records for recording me as the world?s champion lecher of my age. That will ensure my name going down to posterity!

 Come to think of it, there are records of men who sired children after they had passed the century mark through women who were well past what we today consider to be the child-bearing age. There are several instances mentioned in the Bible and, I am told, in our epics as well. In those days they did not maintain records of births and deaths; so we cannot be certain if they are correct. Nor do we know what they took to remain sexually active and fertile in their old ages. Besides, they had frequent droughts and famines and managed to survive eating locusts and wild honey. Perhaps in this combination of insects and bee secretions in their diet lies the secret of their longevity and fertility.

 The easy way out

 Going over the selection of T. N. Raz?s favourite couplets of Urdu poetry, Rangaa-Rang Shaaeree, I came across two amusing examples on ?rishwat khori? (living on bribes) by Dilawar Figar. The first is an advice from a father to his son of the sort of government service he should opt for:

Sunaa hai Baap nay beytey ko

apney yeh naseehat kee

Nehin service mein ?A? kee sharat, ?B?

yaa ?C? bun jaanaa

Jagah kaisee ho, yeh deykhna hai,

mahikmaa kaisaa

Jagah custom mein mil jaaye, to

chapraasee bhee ban jaanaa

I have heard a father advise his son ?Beta jee

If you don?t qualify for Grade A or B, accept C;

But make sure you get into the right department

If it is Customs, accept the job of a chapraasee.

 The second is on what to do if you are arrested for taking a bribe:

Haakim-e-rishwat sitaam fikr-e-

giriftaaree na kar

Kar rihaaee kee koee aasaan

soorat, chhoot jaa

Main bataaoon tujhko, tadbeer-e

rihaaee, mujh sayn pooch

Ley kay rishwat phas gayaa hai,

deykay rishwat chhoot jaa

You bribe-taker if caught do not bother one bit

 Find some easy way to get out of it;

Let me tell you the way out, if you ask me

You were caught taking a bribe, give a bribe and go 

free.

 GETTING THE BETTER OF TECHNOLOGY

 Information overkill

?Technology is the knack of so arranging the world 

that we don?t have to experience it.?

? Max Frisch in Homo Faber

 Broadband services, the technology that simultaneously carries text, data, sound, pictures and video at speeds where this can happen smoothly, will be available in the major metros very soon. Although speeds vary and cannot be fully trusted upon because of erratic power supply, it will affect publishing by making available information and high-resolution pictures at the touch of a button. But is this good news? While it is true that advances in communications technology ? internet and computers ? have been a tremendous influence in the past few years (on the print side of publishing), there is a downside too because technology is a double-edged weapon, it can do good and bad depending on how one uses it.

 Over-reliance on technology has affected editorial quality in two ways. One, there is far too much information available and this has robbed editors of the ability to ask the right questions. Two, editors seem to have forgotten that knowing something and experiencing something are two different things. Information is no substitute for a sense of discrimination and an eye for detail, prerequisites for editorial judgment.

 The result: far too many books that would have been better at half their length. As Saul Bellow, the Nobel laureate, said, excessive use of PCs induces a disease called ?worditis? or ?words, words, words? because they are so simple to punch in. A kind of laziness takes over as editors surrender to the machine. Worse, the nitty-gritty of editorial work ? checking facts, spelling, grammar ? is also given over to computers, with the most outlandish results.

 More of this is likely to happen when broadband services are widely available across the country. The danger comes from the new breed of editors joining publishing. Most drift into publishing as a last resort. Therefore, publishers have a restricted pool to choose from. And those who come in are little prepared for what is required in a profession that calls for a wide range of reading and interests and a constantly questioning attitude. To be a publisher one ought to have taste, literary discrimination and a passion for the work undertaken, along with, in the words of Kurt Wolff, a German publisher, ?the patience of an all-forgiving lover, since, by definition, every creative artist is unbalanced?. Sadly, most of the new set of editors don?t have these qualities and by the time they begin to imbibe them, they tend to move on to greener pastures. 

 What is to be done? Publishers must realize that it isn?t possible to put the genie back into the bottle. Technology is here to stay and grow because it is so user-friendly and saves time and money. But it needs to be drilled into the new editors that broadband is only an aid, to help them with their editorial inputs. The old-fashioned rules of editing ? checking, re-checking, reshaping, revising/rewriting still apply, and probably with greater force as educational standards decline.

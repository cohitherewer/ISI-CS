 Serial blasts 

 Sir ? Leaflets found at the site of the August 17 blasts in Bangladesh indicated the involvement of the Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen, but Dhaka still seems to have doubts about who was responsible (?Dhaka gropes in the dark?, Aug 19). Over the last few years, the fundamentalist Jamaat-e-Islami, which is a part of the ruling coalition, has been virtually calling the shots in the districts. There are rumours linking them to kidnappings, gun-running, extortion and murder. The political leaders in Dhaka, who are busy lining their pockets before their time runs out, have largely failed to deal with the steep rise of the Jamaat and its allies. In the towns, people cower before the mullahs. Camps to train the youth for Islamic struggles are conducted all over. Cox?s Bazar, where I lived and worked for a while, was reputedly surrounded by about 22 camps that had trainees armed with the latest AK 56 rifles. Where did all this come from?

 However much the Bangladesh Army tries to cover these up, it is very apparent that the world, including India, is aware of what is on in that country. Which is why I do not understand India?s hesitation in reacting more strongly. Diplomacy is fine. But what is happening in Bangladesh is dangerous. Dhaka is in a state of denial; it does not even know what is happening in faraway Satkhira or Khulna. Even when the muzzled or sycophant press does mention a few things, they are ignored. It is time for some strict measures. 

 Yours faithfully,

Indraneel Majumdar, Calcutta

 Sir ? It was evident that the serial blasts in 63 districts of Bangladesh were well planned and executed. Such simultaneous action can mean one of two things ? government complicity or a total failure of intelligence. For the last three years, Muslim fundamentalists have been targeting Awami League leaders who, they felt, were pro-India. Dhaka university, its students, professors, writers and intellectuals have been targets of the Islamic fundamentalists. The blasts were aimed at the judiciary, one of the pillars of democracy. The perpetrators wanted their replacement with the shariat courts, presided over by the qazis and ulemas. Chittagong port is used to ferry arms by the Inter-Services Intelligence to destabilize not only democratic Bangladesh, but also West Bengal, Assam and the northeastern states of India. We must take serious note for it seems a taliban is coming up in our backyard.

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Das Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? The gruesome bomb blasts in Bangladesh showed that the country?s greatest enemies are its Islamic fundamentalists. They also raised doubts about the ability of the Khaleda Zia government to check the rise of terrorism in Bangladesh. The Islamic fundamentalists are against development and democracy. And that is the reason their prime targets were the institutions that symbolize civil liberties and democratic values. 

 The Bangladesh Nationalist Party-led government is to be blamed for the blasts since it had been warned, time and again, about the presence of religious fanatics in the country. Repeated attacks on secular politicians, authors (for example, Taslima Nasreen who had to take shelter abroad owing to the fatwa on her) and social activists were conveniently ignored by Zia for political reasons. India, too, cannot remain complacent because the porous border between India and Bangladesh puts the religious fanatics of Bangladesh in an advantageous situation. 

 Yours faithfully,

Anjan Chatterjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? I am amused at the gun-battle between India and Bangladesh in Malda (?Children hurt in Bangla border fire?, Aug 21). Here is a nation that spends billions of dollars on one of the largest armed forces in the world just to show it off at independence day parades on New Delhi?s Rajpath. Or so it seems. Even as the child in Malda was being shot at by the Bangladesh Rifles, why were the fighter pilots, sitting at their posts in Hashimara or Bagdogra or Kalaikunda, not given orders to defend them? It?s time we emulated Indira Gandhi and told Bangladesh enough is enough.

 Yours faithfully,

Rudranil Basu, Reseda, US

 Sir ? The bomb blasts are a sign that Bangladesh is fast sliding into the hands of the Islamic fundamentalism. This is a reality that India?s United Progressive Alliance government had better wake up to as fast as it can. And the situation is unlikely to get any better, since the present government itself consists of parties known to have fundamentalist leanings. The question of illegal immigration of Bangladeshi Muslims, far from being given the political colour that it has been receiving, should be re-examined from the standpoint of national security. 

 Yours faithfully,

Ashwini Chawla, Calcutta

 Sir ? The Bangladesh blasts, following on the heels of the London and Egypt bombings, go to show the destructive potential of the terrorism network operating in the modern world. Any security arrangements governments can muster to deal with the situation will hardly be of help, unless all sections of society cooperate to put the terrorists out of business.

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Sir ? Exploding over 63 bombs simultaneously is no child?s play. One simply shudders to imagine the might and the planning by fundamentalist groups that went into ensuring their success. Interestingly, law and order is the plank riding on which Khaleda Zia came to power. With elections round the corner again, it is the responsibility of the citizens of Bangladesh to opt for a more liberal coalition which could rein in these terrorist groups

 Yours faithfully,

Subhajit Sengupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? The Communist Party of India (Marxist) always makes much of being ?secular?, in other words Muslim -friendly. So why is the CPI(M) so concerned about the bomb blasts in Bangladesh and why does it rue the rise of Islamic fundamentalists in that country? And why is the West Bengal home secretary now thinking of procuring ?explosion-proof? cars for the chief minister and other VIPs from the public exchequer? 

 Yours faithfully, 

Sunil Kumar Pal, London

 NOT MUCH TO CHOOSE FROM

 Uma Bharti may get the BJP some backward votes in Bihar, but she is more likely to alienate the upper castes in the state, writes Sumanta Sen

 Forward pass

 Known always as an upper-caste party, the Bharatiya Janata Party has now decided to make a dent among the backward classes in Bihar and has fielded Uma Bharti for the purpose. Of course, there are no Lodh Rajputs in the state, as there are in adjoining Madhya Pradesh, but the BJP feels that such finer distinctions will not be noticed and that the fiery sanyasin will be able to rope in the backwards as a whole. With her co-star, Arun Jaitley, appealing to the ?forwards? and the allies, Nitish Kumar and Sharad Yadav, taking care of the Kurmis and Yadavs respectively, the National Democratic Alliance feels it will have a nice caste equation going for it.

 On paper this looks fine. Alas, caste politics does not follow such straightforward courses. When Bharti raises a storm in favour of the backwards ? assuming she will be able to do so ? won?t the upper castes, as a whole, feel a bit shaky? One has to remember that it was the Mandal commission report that caused an upheaval among the upper castes in Patna and elsewhere, leading them to flock to the BJP for shelter in larger numbers, as the Congress was perceived to be a fence-sitter. 

 Now, with Laloo Prasad Yadav pitching for the Yadavs, Mayavati (as also Ram Vilas Paswan) for the Dalits and Uma Bharti for the backwards, it is quite likely that the BJP?s upper-caste supporters will receive a jolt. They may not like a leader of their own party queering the pitch for them and who knows, there may be a swing back, however small in terms of percentage, to the Congress. Laloo Yadav, Paswan and Bharti belong to different political parties but, in effect, they are all helping the cause of backward consolidation, which is not to the liking of the Brahmins, Rajputs, and Bhumihars, cutting across party lines. By fielding Bharti, the BJP may well be seen as contributing towards that dreaded effect.

 Fears of a backward consolidation will also create problems within the NDA. The upper castes who broke away from Paswan would most certainly not like to be a party to this. They had sided with Paswan because he had taken up their anti-Laloo battle or, in other words, the battle against Yadav hegemony. They won because voters in their constituencies shared their sentiments. Now if they are seen as part of a formulation seeking to pander to the backwards, will they again get those votes? Of course, many of them see elections as a battle of the bullet, but that?s a game their opponents can play too. And in a state under president?s rule, that game is always difficult to play, more so for parties which belong to the opposition at the Centre.

 There are also other dangers in playing the Bharti card. Her relations with the BJP are still not exactly comfortable and party leaders in Patna may well be a little stiff in her company. How long will she herself agree to play second fiddle to Jaitley? And is the Bihar BJP entirely happy fighting for Nitish Kumar, a man who had no love lost for the Hindutva slogan and no interest in the Ram Mandir issue? During the last elections earlier this year, Shatrughan Sinha had wanted the party to project him as leader of the alliance and though that did not happen, the leadership knew he wasn?t just speaking for himself. Why should not Sushil Modi, seen as a clean politician, harbour thoughts of residing at 1 Anne Marg? As a way of hitting back at the central leadership, Bharti may well kindle such thoughts when she camps in Bihar. After all, it is not the NDA that matters to her so much as the supremacy of the sangh parivar.

 Such fissures would have lain concealed if the elections were held within a month, as the BJP had wanted. But with the Election Commission announcing that the polls will be held in October-November, the cracks are sure to be more visible. No wonder, the BJP and the Janata Dal (United) had been so desperate in their demand for early elections that they had even suggested that the rains did not matter. They had even proferred the specious argument that the floods came after the rains and so the elections could be held even as it poured. 

 Informally, the campaigning has already begun. Recently, in his avatar as the Union railways minister, Laloo Prasad Yadav addressed crowds (large ones, going by television coverage) and his main theme was: ?When Laloo was in Patna nobody dared torture you. Right now I am not there and who will look after you?? Such words, no matter how trite they may sound, do fall on receptive ears in a state where the bulk of the population cannot remember a time when they did not suffer. At least Laloo Yadav managed to kindle in them a little lamp of self-respect ? being a backward in Bihar no longer meant abject acceptance of slavery. That has always been his trump card. The other champions of the backwards in Bihar cannot claim to have done even that.

 ?Laloo?s misrule? is the allegation raised by the NDA, Paswan and, in a muted voice, also the Congress. They have every right to do so. But consider this. Except for a brief period in the Fifties, Bihar has never known what ?proper rule? is. In fact, ?proper rule? is totally beyond the experience of villagers in the Gangetic plains. And why just the villagers, when was the last time that there were municipal elections in the state? Commitment and accountability are terms seemingly unknown to politicians in a state which keeps on sighing for the lost glory of the Magadhan empire. 

 This writer, who was in Patna during successive Congress regimes, never came across an instance of the government being active in any way. There may be serious charges of financial misdemeanour against Laloo Yadav, but the kind of men fielded by the other parties, including the NDA partners, do not also inspire confidence in this regard. Weren?t there complaints against the very vocal Rajiv Pratap Rudi of the BJP, when he was minister in New Delhi last year? Whether or not a man is honest can only be judged by his response to the opportunities that come his way. The BJP or the JD(U) leaders are yet to be exposed to such opportunities, so where is the scope for judging them to be clean? 

 It indeed is a Tweedledee and Tweedledum situation, in which the same old caste equation may turn out to be the deciding factor once again. Despite the many imponderables, will Bharti be able to do the trick for the BJP and the NDA?

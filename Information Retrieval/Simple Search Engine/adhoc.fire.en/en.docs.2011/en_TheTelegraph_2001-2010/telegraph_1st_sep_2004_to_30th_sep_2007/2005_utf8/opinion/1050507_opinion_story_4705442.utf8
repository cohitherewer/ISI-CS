 NOT QUITE BLARING

 The message of a general election manifests itself in strange ways. In the early hours of Friday, Mr Tony Blair became the first person to lead the British Labour Party to a third consecutive election victory. Simultaneously, he set another new record: the winner with the lowest share of the popular vote since the introduction of universal adult franchise in the kingdom. The two landmarks epitomize the paradox of the May 5 verdict. It was both an affirmation of Blairism as the most prudent course of governance and a sharp rap on the knuckle for the man who made it happen. The electorate helped its prime minister create history, but simultaneously deflated his achievement by crippling his authority. It was an endorsement of New Labour?s modernizing agenda and an expression of disgust with the slippery ways of its leader. No wonder the celebrations were subdued and no wonder the outcome was greeted with the cruel suggestion that the country now had a lame-duck prime minister. With a comfortable majority of 355 (626 out of 646 declared), Mr Blair should have been planning his final innings with aplomb. Instead, he is crippled by the prevailing speculation over when exactly he intends to pass on the baton to the anointed successor, Mr Gordon Brown.

 It is, of course, premature to write the political obituary of a leader who remains the envy of the democratic world for his ability to inveigle his way out of sticky situations. The credibility and integrity of the British prime minister were questioned by the electorate because of the way he sought to justify his country?s involvement in the Iraq war. Yet, the war is now history. The protest vote having been registered, it is unlikely that controversies over the legality of the anti-Saddam Hussein enterprise and Britain?s unquestioned obedience of American desires will continue to dog him into the third term. Mr Blair will now be judged on the strength of his domestic agenda, particularly his ability to keep inflation under check, taxes low, raise state pensions and bolster the health and education sectors. These are unglamorous issues. More to the point, they are subjects that do not warrant lofty forays into the Vision Thing ? Mr Blair?s undoubted specialization. Equally, the prime minister will be confronted with the inevitable impatience that accompanies the presence of a leader who has been at the helm for too long. Even someone as redoubtable as Ms Margaret Thatcher was confronted by this staleness factor in her third term and had to ultimately succumb to it. Temperamentally, Mr Blair is prone to trying his hand at grand projects and relying on an overdose of spin. He will be naturally ill at ease with the parish pump agenda that has been set by the quirky outcome of last Thursday?s election. His instinct will be to try a break-out, regain the political initiative and reshape his government?s priorities. If he succeeds, he may well be there to fight for a fourth innings. Alternatively, the May 5 election could mark the beginning of the end of a leader who rescued his party from the infantile disorders of socialism.

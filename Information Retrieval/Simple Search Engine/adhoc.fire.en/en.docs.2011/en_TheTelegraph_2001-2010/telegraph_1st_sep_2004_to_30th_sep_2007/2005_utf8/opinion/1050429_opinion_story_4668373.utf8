 Letters to Editor

 Have stick, will beat

 Sir ? On April 19, around 6 pm, my driver was trying to park our car in a clearing opposite Virginia House on Chowringhee Road. A few cars were already parked there. Just as our car entered the area, a jawan came rushing towards us, stick in hand, and demanded that my driver open the window so that he could hit him. The reason: the area was reserved for the military. When I pointed out that there was no sign indicating this, he used choicest expletives and pointed to a man who was digging a hole to erect a signpost. The signpost itself was lying on the ground. My driver reversed the car and got out of the area. But I saw two other cars getting the same treatment. The jawan was happily using his stick on the arms of the drivers. Later I met a motorcyclist who had had the headlights of his vehicle smashed for the same ?offence?. This man was scared to even complain because an army personnel was involved. We have heard about army excesses in Kashmir and Manipur, but on Chowringhee Road in Calcutta?

 Yours faithfully,

 D. Basu, Calcutta

 Get real

 Sir ? In the global arena, India seems to be on a roll. And at Bandung, Asian recognition too came its way (?Singh at head; of walk and Asia?, April 25). When Manmohan Singh concluded the session of the Afro-Asian conference on behalf of the Asian countries, it was significant for India since it would go a long way in strengthening India?s candidacy for permanent membership of the UN security council. The fact that India earned the distinction in spite of the presence of the Asian giants like China or Japan, is in itself a tribute to India?s leadership qualities. India?s all-round development has made its impact in the region. 

 The prime minister?s speech was also full of pragmatism and insight. Most of the Asian and African countries are poorer than their European and American counterparts. In fact, Asia and Africa account for 70 per cent of the developing countries of the world. So, a strong friendship along socio-economic lines between these continents can help them emerge as a strong power bloc.

 If India wishes to be the ?leader of the developing nations?, it will have to take actions as befit this title both in its domestic and international affairs. No doubt India?s ?presence? has been felt at the Afro-Asian forum, but leadership is something that still needs to be worked on.

 Yours faithfully,

Sayantan Das, Konnagar

 Sir ? Efforts in the right direction seldom go unrewarded. India?s prominence at Bandung was in fact the reward of successfully initiating economic reforms and practising democracy for more than half a century.

 The symbolic honour bestowed on Manmohan Singh, the prime minister of India, to speak on behalf of Asian countries, has more to it than meets the eye. This is an invitation to India to lead the movement of 106 countries so that their aspirations may be realized. But India must make sure that the mistakes of the non-aligned movement are not repeated. These mistakes landed India in a disconcerting and humiliating situation. India lost territory to the more powerful China, and failed to retrieve lost territory in Kashmir from a smaller Pakistan. These put a question mark on the eligibility of India to provide leadership to the non-aligned countries.

 Those who underestimate the importance of power and also of being in the good books of the powerful learn the lesson the hard way. Opportunities wither away unless their are proactively grabbed. One hopes India will not squander the opportunity provided in Bandung. India must learn to take up and discharge global responsibilities to make its presence felt as a global power.

 Yours faithfully,

Hem Raj Jain, Bangalore

 Sir ? I feel that too much is being made of the strategic partnership between African and Asian countries. Since little had come of the last Bandung conference of 1955, what is the guarantee that things will change radically now? Sunanda K. Datta-Ray is correct in observing that food and peace are as compelling concerns for Asians and Africans in 2005 as they were in 1955 (?Coloured people?s gala?, April 23). With the pressure of rising population and depleting resources, these concerns do not seem to be in any hurry to disappear. Ethnic clashes will put a spanner in the works of the unification process, while the unipolar world will continue to play the policy of divide and rule to maintain the status quo.

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? India?s misplaced obsession with the institution of democracy in Nepal is amusing (?No firm policy?, April 28). New Delhi has no problem breaking bread with non- democratic nations like Pakistan, China, Myanmar and so on, but adopts a holier-than-thou stance with Nepal. Who are we to talk about democracy when good criminal connection is all one needs to become a people?s representative in India? Unless we shed our anachronistic Nehruvian surrealism in foreign policy and ?get tough? where warranted, we will never earn the world?s respect. India is diffident and passive by nature ? we must transform this psyche into a dynamic and an aggressive one if we expect India to be taken seriously.

 Yours faithfully,

J.K. Dutt, Calcutta

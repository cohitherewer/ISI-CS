 WHO WILL BELL THE VAT CAT?

 SHOT IN THE DARK

 All the mysteries of the Indian market can be explained in a single word these days

 The latest word to have enriched the Indian vocabulary ? after ?tsunami? ? is, of course, VAT. But we haven?t progressed very far from the expanded form of the word, value-added tax. But what lies beneath is still anybody?s guess. 

 And yet, offices ? both public and private ? public transport, markets and roadside tea-shops have become the hub of VAT-related discussions and debates. Not in a long time has anything captured the national imagination as strongly.

 North Block mandarins are singing paeans to the new tax. Financial experts and industrial heads are explaining its benefits on the round-the-clock news and business channels. But all of it is in the language of economics, which is like Hebrew to small traders and the lay consumer. 

 Sample this. Asked about the consequences of the new tax, the grocer in my neighbourhood in south Calcutta sounded dismissive: ?It?s just another tax. We all know they only drive up prices.? Stumped, I mumbled about having read that VAT is supposed to drive the prices down. 

 ?You?ll see?, he warned. 

 The chicken-seller in the market warned me, ?Murgir daam kintu barbe.? (The price of chicken is sure to go up.)

 Shocked, I asked why. 

 ?Arrey murgir khabaare 12.5 per cent VAT boshechhe je?? (Because they?ve imposed a 12.5 per cent VAT on chicken-feed.)

 Even the slightest fluctuation in market prices is now explained in a single word ? VAT. 

 The second-hand bookseller on College Street is no longer amenable to bargaining. ?Ashir niche hobena bhai. VAT dite hobena?? (Sorry brother, can?t make it less than 80 rupees, have to pay VAT). To justify this, he would have to give me a cash memo, which, of course, he was not forthcoming about. 

 We are still pretty much groping in the dark to find what VAT means to the traders and the consumers. The belief that VAT is bad news only for the middlemen, and a bringer of relief for all others, has been all but dispelled ? with the prices of most goods, including life-saving drugs, rising by anything between 5 and 15 per cent. 

 The mind boggles at the prevailing confusion. Somewhere between the policy-makers and taxpayers, a simple, rational explanation is getting lost. True to Indian tradition, some tax officials have been lazy with the paperwork, and so, VAT numbers have not been issued on time to many traders. But they would have gone on strike even if the numbers had reached. The scene gets more complicated with each passing day.

 So what is the VAT regime leading us to? Utter confusion? More strikes? 

 India does not have much in common with Ghana, the only country that has failed to implement VAT. The chief problem, it seems, was its government?s failure to communicate the nuances of the tax to the industry and consumers. Does this ring any bells?

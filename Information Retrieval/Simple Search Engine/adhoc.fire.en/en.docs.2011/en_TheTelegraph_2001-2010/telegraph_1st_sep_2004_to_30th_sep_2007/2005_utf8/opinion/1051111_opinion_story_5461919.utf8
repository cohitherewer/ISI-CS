 MAKING FRIENDS

 The 13th summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, which begins at Dhaka, is faced with the challenge of still proving that the organization is capable of becoming a dynamic institution of regional integration. Although SAARC has made notable progress in the last few years, it still lags far behind other regional organizations. This is despite the fact that the first SAARC summit was held 25 years ago. As is well known, the idea of regional cooperation in south Asia was first mooted in January, 1980 and the foreign secretaries first met in May, 1981. The present summit, which is usually an annual affair, is being held after two years because of a variety of concerns expressed by India. It is being held at a time when India?s relations with Pakistan are acquiring some stability, but ties with Nepal and even Bangladesh are fragile. The Nepalese monarchy has paid little heed to Indian advice as it continues to become even more authoritarian than before. Meanwhile, Bangladesh is continuing to be a hotbed for extremists. In addition, Dhaka has done little to prevent anti-India elements from using it as a sanctuary. 

 Historically, the principal problem with SAARC has also been that some of the smaller countries of the region have often used it to gang up against New Delhi. Sometimes led by Pakistan, they have tried to raise political issues, which is prohibited by the charter. India has naturally found it more convenient to deal bilaterally with its neighbours. And New Delhi has, not surprisingly, even bypassed the region in its quest for trading ties. However, in the recent past, after India?s economic rise, it has become clear to many of the smaller countries that it is in their interest to integrate with the larger Indian market. Moreover, the World Trade Organization agreement has meant that willy-nilly these south Asian countries would have to open up their economies to the world. The south Asian free-trade agreement was signed in 2004 in Islamabad and will come into force in January, 2006. There is thus some ground for optimism. SAARC, however, is nowhere near reaching the success of the Association of South East Asian Nations, leave alone acquiring the strength of the European Union. The Dhaka summit will be a success if the leaders of the SAARC countries actually commit themselves to a tangible document for greater cooperation on a range of economic and social areas that have been the basis of negotiation for the last two decades.

 TALKING IT OUT

 It is too early to conclude if the range of recent new initiatives will lead to the return of peace and stability in Jammu and Kashmir. The problem is that most of the measures undertaken do not seem to be part of a well-thought-out comprehensive policy. Clearly, there need to be two aspects to a Kashmir policy. First, India needs to have a carefully worked out framework to deal with Pakistan. Second, it is imperative to have a blueprint for handling problems within the state. On both these fronts, there seem to be confusion and ad hocism. As far as Pakistan goes, the trouble is that a long-term understanding of policy goals seems to be restricted to only the prime minister and his closest advisors. Mr Manmohan Singh views improving relations with all neighbours, including Pakistan, as part of a strategy to position New Delhi as a major player in international relations. In this view, a country which cannot resolve problems in its own backyard will not be taken seriously as a global actor of consequence. Mr Singh also seems to have developed a working relationship with Pakistan?s president, General Pervez Musharraf. In contrast, much of the rest of the national security establishment thinks otherwise. If this was part of a deliberate good cop-bad cop strategy it would have been understandable. But the security establishment seems to be actively undermining this agenda. 

 Similarly, on the domestic front, problems persist. Mr Singh believes that it is important to reach out to all those in the valley and beyond who have felt alienated by the Central government?s policies. It is well known that neither the intelligence agencies nor the home ministry seem to be in favour of talks with the All Party Hurriyat Conference. Non-official interlocutors arranged the prime minister?s meeting with the separatists. Further talks could be jeopardized by these agencies. There is also talk of a change in the government in Srinagar. There was an understanding between the Congress and the People?s Democratic Party in November 2002 that the Congress would get the chief minister?s position after three years. But circumstances have changed. At a time when Kashmir is being discussed bilaterally with Pakistan, and international focus is on the state, political instability would hamper national interest. To have a chief minister from a party that is seen as responsible for most of the problems in the state would further alienate the valley. In short, a Kashmir policy dictated by partisan or narrow bureaucratic interests is a recipe for disaster.

 DUAL TONE

 What Bengal thinks today, Delhi does not think today or tomorrow. This is the conclusion that suggests itself from the two different pulls emanating from the Communist Party of India (Marxist). The headquarters of the CPI(M) in Gopalan Bhavan in New Delhi has views which are contradictory to those expressed by comrades in West Bengal. There are two assumptions in the previous sentence. One is that the views of Mr Prakash Karat, the general secretary of the CPI(M), are those of the party headquarters; and second, the opinions and actions of Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, the chief minister of West Bengal, represent the stand favoured by the West Bengal unit of the party. Mr Karat and his supporters in Delhi are distinctly uncomfortable with globalization and many aspects of the economic reforms agenda. They cannot accept the new ties of friendship between India and the United States of America that have been established after Mr Manmohan Singh?s visit to Washington. The very idea of disinvestment in BHEL sends comrades in Delhi into a tizzy. All this would have been par for the course for a communist party but for the fact that the former chief minister of West Bengal, Mr Jyoti Basu, who is still a member of the CPI(M) politburo, finds nothing objectionable in the joint statement issued by the US president and the Indian prime minister. Further, Mr Bhattacharjee is a keen advocate of economic reforms, and his government plans to disinvest from selected public sector units. The CPI(M) has either become a party with two distinct voices, or it has mastered the art of speaking in a forked tongue.

 This schizophrenia of the CPI(M) might be rooted in the fact that the party has to rule West Bengal, but in Delhi it has no such responsibility. Mr Bhattacharjee knows that without investments, West Bengal is a red desert. He sees in economic reforms an opportunity to secure investments for West Bengal and thus rejuvenate the state. His success in this endeavour is worthy of notice and applaud. He has not allowed ideology to cloud his judgment of what is good for the state he rules. Mr Karat, on the other hand, sees the CPI(M) as Mr Singh?s loyal opposition. It is a part of the United Progressive Alliance but is the single biggest hindrance to the policies the prime minister wants to pursue. The central leadership of the CPI(M) has no sense of responsibility, but has an illusion of power.

 Letters to Editor

 One man?s whim

 Sir ? On television recently, I heard the railways minister, Laloo Prasad Yadav, saying that he raised the price of platform tickets to Rs 5 in a fit of anger, and on cooling down, reduced it to Rs 3 again. The prime minister should seriously consider keeping such a whimsical minister in the cabinet. Earlier, he had replaced plastic tumblers with earthenware kulhars on Indian trains, on the ground that plastic is not bio-degradable. But neither is baked earthenware. Earthenware over 5,000 years old have been dug up at Mohenjodaro, with no signs of bio-degradation.

 Yours faithfully,

C.V.K. Moorthy, Calcutta

 Sons of the soil

 Sir ? The controversial Scheduled Tribes (Recognition of Forest Rights) bill proposed by the United Progressive Alliance government smacks of political machinations rather than concern for the rights of the tribal people. Those who support the bill either do so from an academic point of view, or because they want an opportunity to exploit the remaining forests in the name of protecting tribal rights. 

 From my experience in some tribal belts of India, I have seen that tribal villages are being destroyed with impunity. As a result, the green cover is getting thinner every day. We have lost large tracts of forest to unplanned and unimaginative development. But if we do not consider the present bill by rising above political considerations, the impact might be devastating. There must be a proper plan to curb the activities of the forest mafia. The irreversible damage we have already done to the environment is reflected in the annual rise in temperature, heat waves, diminishing rainfall and depleting water tables. 

 Any attempt to aggravate the condition, for political and other reasons, will be catastrophic. We must at first educate, motivate, engage and involve the tribals and only then can we consider the bill for discussion. The precedent set by ?Chipko? leader, Sunderlal Bahuguna, and the efforts of Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi should not be wasted. 

 Yours faithfully,

Amitava Goswamy, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? It was disturbing to read about tribals eating red soil after being stopped from cultivating in the woodlands (?Lunching on red soil?, June 6). Can this be a diet on which people can be expected to survive? We have just celebrated environment day, with talk of preserving forests. But how can we forget the people who depend on the forests for their livelihood? They must be given alternative means of livelihood before a diktat such as the one pronounced by N. Chandrababu Naidu is passed on cultivation. We talk about environment and forests and food-chain because it is fashionable, but actually do very little for the people who are directly affected. The least we can do is elevate shocking stories like this to the front page.

 Yours faithfully, 

Anuradha Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir ? I support Anbumani Ramadoss?s proposal to ban smoking from Indian movies. I hope that a similar ban can be imposed here in the US. For too long now, producers, directors and ?stars? such as John Travolta, Sean Penn, and others have made movies that seem to glorify smoking. Young people are influenced by them just as they were 50 years ago by Bogart, Wayne and Bacall. But we know better now and should not let filmmakers lead the audience astray in the name of ?creative expression?.

 Yours faithfully,

Dominick Gautrau, Centerville, US

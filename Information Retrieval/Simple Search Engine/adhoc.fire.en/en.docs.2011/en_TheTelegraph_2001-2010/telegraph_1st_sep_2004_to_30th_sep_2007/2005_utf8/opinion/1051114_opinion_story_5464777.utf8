 THE TRUTH ABOUT THE INDO-US NUCLEAR DEAL

 Twenty-Twenty / Bharat Bhushan

 Not equals

 All the concerns being expressed in the aftermath of the July 18 joint statement between the United States of America and India on nuclear cooperation have been proved right.

 As the complexities of the proposed nuclear deal become evident, it is clear that criticism of the deal was neither based on anti-Americanism nor on anti-Congress feelings. The criticism was simply of the manner in which this highly complex issue had been negotiated and the spin given to it ? with the specific purpose of highlighting the positives and glossing over the negatives ? whereas for a decision of such national importance, there should have been more frankness, transparency and objectivity.

 The latest testimonies of the US under secretary for political affairs, Nicholas Burns, and the under-secretary for arms control and international security, Robert Joseph, before the senate foreign relations committee earlier this month reiterate the American position on the deal. Their testimonies go counter to what Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told parliament.

 In his statement to parliament, Singh had said that the US would be the first to implement its commitment and India would follow. He had said: ?I would like to make it very clear that our commitments would be conditional upon, and reciprocal to, the US fulfilling its side of this understanding? and, again, ?Indian actions will be contingent at every stage on actions taken by the other side.?

 The Americans are saying just the reverse ? they will not approach the congress till India has fulfilled its part of the bargain. Burns thus told the senate committee, ?Our judgment is that it would not be wise or fair to ask congress to make such a consequential decision without evidence that the Indian government was acting on what is arguably the most important of its commitments ? the separation of its civilian and military nuclear facilities.?

 The prime minister had told parliament that the separation of civilian and military facilities will be done in a phased manner ? ?phased action, in terms of identification and separation of civilian nuclear facilities based solely on our duly calibrated national decisions will be taken at appropriate points of time.?

 The Americans are saying the opposite ? that India should prepare a credible and transparent blueprint for the separation of civilian and military facilities and share it with them. Thus Burns said, ? I told the Indian leadership in Delhi two weeks ago that it must craft a credible and transparent plan and have begun to implement it before the administration would request Congressional action.?

 This means that India will not have the option of keeping some of its civilian facilities outside safeguards to begin with, which will then be brought under International Atomic Energy Agency?s safeguards in a phased manner on the basis of independent, sovereign decisions.

 It had also been suggested by the government at the highest levels that under this agreement with the US, India will have the same rights and obligations as those of other states with advanced nuclear technology like the US. Now, the US says that will not be the case.

 It is now demanding that India?s civilian facilities be put under safeguards in perpetuity. Joseph said as much to the senate committee: ?To ensure that the US and other potential suppliers can confidently supply to India and meet our obligations under the NPT, safeguards must be applied in perpetuity.?

 Unlike in the case of other nuclear weapons states, India will not be able to withdraw any civilian facility from the safeguards regime as and when it wants for national security reasons. The US itself has withdrawn a facility from the IAEA safeguards for production of Tritium for weapons.

 What is even more perplexing is that the foreign secretary, Shyam Saran, in a recent speech modified the prime minister?s statement to parliament as well as the statements of the chairman of the atomic energy commission. 

 Speaking on ?Nuclear non-proliferation and international security? in Delhi, the foreign secretary said, ?It makes no sense for India to deliberately keep some of its civilian facilities out of its declaration for safeguards purposes, if it is really interested in obtaining international cooperation on as wide a scale as possible. This would be quite illogical.?

 Saran?s advocacy of putting all our civilian nuclear facilities under safeguards at one go contradicts the prime minister?s statement in parliament. Manmohan Singh had said that this would be done in phases, on a voluntary basis and in tune with our national security interests.

 The implications of this are all the more serious as this advocates putting even the Fast Breeder Reactor programme under safeguards which it would appear from the statements of the Atomic Energy Commission, is not India?s intention. The FBR is vital to India?s future energy security and being at an experimental stage, it cannot be subject to the intrusive control of the IAEA without adverse effects. It is no surprise then that this specific part of the foreign secretary?s lecture was quoted approvingly by both Burns and Joseph before the senate committee.

 Related to this is the editorial in China?s Renmin Ribao (People?s Daily) that also unmasks China?s real position on India?s aspirations to acquire the status of an international power equal to the P-5, and more specifically to China.

 China?s arguments have the potential of derailing US efforts to get the Nuclear Suppliers? Group to modify its rules with respect to civilian nuclear cooperation with India. China?s argument is that the US is entering into a deal with India contrary to accepted non-proliferation principles and that it is only making a gesture to India as its friend. The US argument, on the other hand, places this opening to India in the context of ending its isolation and making it a part of the international non-proliferation regime.

 China has threatened that other countries (read China) will now be encouraged to do similar deal with their friends (read Pakistan). What the Chinese posturing shows is its clear strategic commitment to Pakistan.

 The import of the People?s Daily article is China?s determination to continue to build Pakistan as its strategic front against India. China has now also added its name to the list of other countries in the NSG who are opposed to accommodating India ? including Scandinavian countries, Japan and South Africa. With this, the US promise to deliver its side of the bargain looks even more doubtful.

 This should induce us to be more cautious about being pushed into making any more concessions to the US simply because President George Bush would be coming here in February. The integrity of India?s foreign policy should not be tweaked to please visiting foreign leaders.

 When approaching the Americans, our leaders should not go in a frame of mind that Washington has all the cards and we have none. Such a loss of nerve in dealing with the US will place us in a seriously disadvantageous negotiating position. A sustained Indo-US relationship can only be built on the foundation of durable, long-term interests on both sides. And if these really exist, then the relationship will not be derailed if we do not vote with the US on Iran or yield to pressure on the nuclear deal contrary to our long-term interests.

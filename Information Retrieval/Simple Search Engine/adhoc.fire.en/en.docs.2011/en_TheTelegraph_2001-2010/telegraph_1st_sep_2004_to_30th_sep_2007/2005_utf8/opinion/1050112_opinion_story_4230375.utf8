 Letters to Editor

 Passport to prosperity

 Sir ? Manmohan Singh may have tried to go one up on Atal Bihari Vajpayee?s PIO card by offering dual citizenship to all those who left India after January 26, 1950 (?Cloud on dual citizenship offer?, Jan 9). Ostensibly, the dual citizenship is meant to help foster a sense of belonging among the NRIs. But if the dismal attendance at the meet in Mumbai this year is anything to go by, we must have really put off the NRIs to have to woo them back so assiduously now. It seems more likely, thus, that the real object of the proposal is to make it easier for the NRIs to invest in the country now. But if Singh is serious about getting NRIs to invest, he has a lot on his hands. For he can?t afford to lose the NRI confidence and goodwill especially as business proposals continue to be plagued by bureaucratic delays and our labour laws remain as obstructive as ever. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Aashish Mazumder, Calcutta

 Highs and lows

 Sir? Sukanta Chaudhuri is perhaps getting a little carried away when he makes much of Bengal?s academic strengths (?A knowledge hub?, Jan 4). He says that compared to other states, the curricular bent of mind here is more congenial to creating a knowledge hub that the entire country can draw on. 

 Our education system is essentially a clone of the British system prevalent 100 years ago. With no disrespect intended towards either Jadavpur or Calcutta University, the standards our students have to deal with are miserably poor compared to those in Britain. And if selling out to the West helps, then we should do it too. Remember, that is how South Korea built up its solid research and development base, and Japan developed techniques to make the best and cheapest cars in the world. 

 Many Indians are successful today in the global economy because of their natural propensity to work hard, not because of the Indian education system. Else Indian students would not be going overseas to pursue their studies. Remember also that our education system encourages learning by rote and discourages creativity. Facilities for extra-curricular activities are terrible (if present at all), the syllabus is outdated and quite often, students are made to learn rather useless topics. 

 Yours faithfully,

Aruni Mukherjee, Earlsdon, UK

 Sir? Sukanta Chaudhuri has emphasized the fact that West Bengal is rich in educational resources and talent. But in writing about the many maladies that afflict the educational set-up in the state, he could also have included the fact that students from Bengal perform very badly in all-India recruitment examinations in comparison with those from other states. 

 Various new courses may have been introduced in the state?s universities and private institutions of late. But it is the school syllabus that needs modernizing, and the authorities have not turned their attention to it despite promising to do so many a time. Unless this problem is addressed soon, students in West Bengal will continue to pay the price in the long run. 

 Yours faithfully,

Pijush Banerjee, Calcutta 

 Sir? Sukanta Chaudhuri is being simplistic when he says that, were we to discover rich deposits of rare mineral in our state, we would hurry to exploit it and thereby benefit our economy. In reality, we would probably do nothing of the sort. The development of a state depends a lot upon the ability, efficiency and entrepreneurship of its people. Human beings everywhere were on the same footing at some point in the past ? naked and hunting to survive. Yet, how is it that certain countries developed rapidly while others did not? Bengal will remain underdeveloped even if it had all the resources in the world. That is, until the attitude of the Bengalis changes radically ? and to hope for that is wishful thinking.

 That aside, rich deposits of minerals alone do not lead to the development of a country. (All resources can be obtained at a price from elsewhere.) Many countries have performed spectacularly on the development front despite not being rich in resources. Nearer home, Jharkhand, with an abundance of resources, continues to remain one of the poorest states in India, while Punjab, without any such rich deposits of minerals, is one of the richest. 

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C.Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir? There have been many proposals to improve higher education in West Bengal, but they have not had any effect on the ground. I am writing to highlight the plight of a friend. He is intelligent, has been consistently good in his studies and he has never failed in any examination. But he failed in his first year examinations in college despite writing the papers to his satisfaction. All this leads one to deduce that since examiners get paid very little to check answer-scripts, they do not take sufficient care while doing so. My friend, meanwhile, is suicidal. Is this fair? 

 Yours faithfully,

 Syed Jameel, Calcutta

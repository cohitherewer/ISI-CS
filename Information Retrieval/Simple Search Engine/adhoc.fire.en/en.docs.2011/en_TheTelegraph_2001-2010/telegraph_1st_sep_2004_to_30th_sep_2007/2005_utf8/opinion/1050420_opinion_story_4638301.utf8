 HE STAYED BEHIND 

OBITUARY

BOB WRIGHT

(1924-2005) 

A chapter of history that was begun by Thomas Babington 

Macaulay in the 1830s came to a close in the early hours of Tuesday, April 19 

when Robert Hamilton Wright died in his sleep at the Tollygunge Club. Bob, as 

he was fondly called by all who knew him, embodied a vanished era of the Indo-British 

encounter. He was a pukka sahib of the colonial era who had made 

India his home.

Bob wore his King?s College, Cambridge tie very proudly 

and was fond of saying that at King?s he was a contemporary of Sunny (Indrajit) 

Gupta. If communism claimed Sunny, the managing agency system beckoned Bob. He 

came out to join Andrew Yule, then a sprawling empire within the economic framework 

of the British raj. But Bob came into his elements after he took over the 

management of the Tollygunge Club in the early Seventies. He ran the Club till 

1997 but continued to live there till his death.

When Bob began running Tolly, the times were not easy. 

There was political trouble and the area around the Club was a turbulent one. 

His mode of management was old-fashioned benevolent despotism. He ran Tolly like 

a feudal estate. It is easy to criticize that approach from the standpoint of 

new-fangled management techniques but the Tolly survived largely because of the 

charisma that Bob built up around his persona. That charisma grew out of his generosity, 

his bonhomie, his loyalty to his friends and from an almost unending capacity 

to enjoy life. Even Bob?s best friends would not mistake the charisma to be a 

halo but his foibles made him all the more loveable. He had oodles of charm.

Bob never liked the epithet Raja Wright of Tollygunge 

Club but there is actually no better way to describe him and his presence. During 

his tenure, he was always there in the mornings, having breakfast at the Shamiana. 

Around him were his labradors having their own breakfasts while Bob read The 

Daily Telegraph, two days old. He loved doing the crossword, both the quick 

and the cryptic varieties. And he was very good at it. A month before he died, 

I went to see him with a friend of mine. It was around nine in the evening. Bob 

had finished dinner but a pink gin was at hand. Seeing us, his eyes lit up and 

he asked for another chhota. In the course of the conversation, we asked 

what a screen behind the altar was called (this was a crossword clue). The answer 

was prompt, ?reredos?, he said, and then added with a twinkle in his eye, ?You 

can always call me when you are stuck.?

There was life outside Tolly. He was a familiar figure 

at the races and at the polo ground. He was devoted to his work with Dr Graham?s 

Homes in Kalimpong. Further afield, there was his beloved Kipling Camp in Kanha. 

But home was the Tolly, and it is fitting that he died in his estate, and that 

his loyal staff were the first to discover that their beloved Wright saab 

had gone.

Was Bob an Indian or was he English? There was something 

quintessentially English about Bob Wright but he belonged to a more gracious epoch 

of social life in Calcutta. It was in India that he had most of his friends. But 

in a very real sense, Bob?s identity was his own. 

With his death nobody will ever say koi hai 

in quite the same way.

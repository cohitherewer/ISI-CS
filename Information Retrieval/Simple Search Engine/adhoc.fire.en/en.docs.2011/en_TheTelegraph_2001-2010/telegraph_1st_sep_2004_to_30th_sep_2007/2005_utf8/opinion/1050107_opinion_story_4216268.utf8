 Letters to Editor

 Relief at a price

 Sir ? A kilogram of dal for Rs 45, potatoes and onions for Rs 30 and Rs 35 a kg respectively is outrageously expensive for many. And to think that these are the prices for which the relief rations are being sold in Port Blair (?Relief at a price for starving children?, Jan 4). Besides, those who needed help most were denied it by the policemen on duty, who obviously had no prior briefing on what was required in their new roles. There is little to be gained from lamenting at the lack of humanity and ethics in relief operations, for similar such reports during other calamities have often been heard of. With a deluge of donations in cash and kind, perhaps the least that the government can do is ensure stricter norms for their proper disbursal. As for the donors, they will be better advised to select the agencies they donate to prudently ? keeping in mind their past records in relief operations. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Dilip Das, Calcutta

 Sing along

 Sir ? It is to be hoped that the Supreme Court does not decide in favour of the petitioner who wants the word ?Sindh? removed from our national anthem, on the logic that Sindh is now a part of Pakistan (?Word wrangle in anthem lyrics?, Dec 4). The petitioner wants Sindh replaced with Kashmir instead. 

 We who have been singing Jana gana mana for over half a century now, have always been aware that Sindh does not belong to independent India. We would only be making ourselves the butt of jokes if we suddenly became over-sensitive to the geo-political reality and deleted or replaced Sindh from our national anthem. On a lighter note, Pakistan has been good enough not to make an issue of our using the word, ?Sindh?, in our anthem, because the region is a part of that country. 

 The deletion of Sindh and the insertion of Kashmir, if they do come about, will hurt the sentiments of many. Not all the Indian states are mentioned in our anthem, and such insistence on including a particular state is unfair. For example, I haven?t taken umbrage at the omission of Assam. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Omar Luther King, Delhi

 Sir ? It does not make much sense to distort the rhythm of the national anthem by replacing Sindh with Kashmir. The Central government?s plea that the expression ?Sindh? in the national anthem refers to the culture of Sindhis in India and not merely the physical province is a logical explanation and should be accepted. 

 The focus could instead be diverted to the renaming of West Bengal, especially as Calcutta has given way to Kolkata. West Bengal should simply be called Bengal because the prefix has lost its relevance. The state was named West Bengal at the time of India?s independence because this western part of the erstwhile united Bengal became a part of India while the eastern part became East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). East Pakistan has vanished from the global map, and it makes little sense to continue with an Indian state being called West Bengal. The name has also caused confusion among young students because the state is situated in the eastern part of the country. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir ? I don?t think we have the right to change the lyrics of a song. This is because the copyright belongs to its composer, in this case, Rabindranath Tagore. It has to be remembered that Tagore?s song was accepted as our national anthem by the constituent assembly as long back as 1950.

 Besides, no attempt must be entertained to tamper with the anthem. Going by the whims being displayed by the people of late, what would happen if the government changed and some minister insisted on including his name in the anthem? 

 Yours faithfully,

Sandeep Shirkhedkar, Nagpur

 At the airport

 Sir ? I took a flight to Bangkok from the Calcutta airport some time back and was appalled by the overall experience. Passengers did not have a clue as to where to queue up and the authorities just could not seem to manage them. The toilet at the departure lounge was smelly, dirty and all the taps were leaking. The lounge itself was full of mosquitoes. 

 I don?t expect five-star standards overnight, but certain basic standards can surely be adhered to? The authorities should make the airport authorities more accountable. If this is how things are at the gateway to the state, one wonders how Bengal hopes to attract investment, let alone foreign investment. 

 Yours faithfully,

Suresh Kumar, Calcutta

 Sir ? While visiting Calcutta, my luggage was mishandled at the Calcutta airport. My suitcase had split into two and the zipper was broken. But the help extended by the airlines and the airport staff amazed me. Everyone, including the head baggage handler, airlines staff, certain employees of the Airports Authority of India and the customs officials, were extremely cooperative and sympathetic. Some of them even went a step further to locate some of my belongings that got had scattered at the airport. Experiencing such hospitality, I have no regrets that I paid extra fare compared to other airlines.

Yours faithfully, Sunil K. Gupta, Los Angeles,

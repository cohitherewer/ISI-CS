 SPEAKING EASY 

 - A presence on the page

 Coleridge: addicted to talk

 The Writer?s Voice 

 By Al Alvarez,

 Bloomsbury, ? 9.10

 Early in April 1819, just a few days before he wrote ?La Belle Dame Sans Merci?, Keats, then twenty-four, met the middle-aged Coleridge on Hampstead Heath, accompanied by a common acquaintance. After quickly ? and quietly ? making sure with this person that it would be alright to do so, Keats joined them for a two-mile walk, at what the younger poet described as Coleridge?s ?alderman-after-dinner pace?. While writing later to his brother and sister-in-law about this encounter, what Keats remembered most vividly was Coleridge?s voice, and the mesmerizing range of subjects ? from nightingales and nightmares to mermaids and metaphysics ? that the older poet?s monologue skated across as they walked together: ?Good morning ? I heard his voice as he came towards me ? I heard it as he moved away ? I heard it all the interval ? if it may be called so.? Keats died two years later, and Coleridge remembered this meeting too; but he did so in terms of Keats?s touch. He said in his table-talk that Keats?s handshake had felt like that of a dying man. 

 Voice and touch: human presence and, equally, human absence are most often felt or remembered in terms of these two tragically impermanent sensations. The ostensible subject of Al Alvarez?s little book ? based on three lectures given at the New York Public Library in 2002 ? is the writer?s voice as ?a presence on the page?. For Alvarez, any account of ?imaginative writing? must tell the twin stories of how a writer ?finds? his voice and of how the reader, in turn, learns to listen and respond to it. Who are we listening to, for instance, in Keats?s account of the walk with Coleridge? How many voices are competing here for the reader?s attention? Can one not read, in the way the voices of Keats and Coleridge continually upstage each other, the story of how two generations of writers spoke and listened to one another at a particular historical moment, so that English Romanticism may itself be read, or heard, as a series of inspiring, but overwhelming conversations?

 This Romantic episode, together with the questions arising out of it, does not figure in Alvarez?s book, although they well might have, judging from his three-page preface to the lectures, which is really the best bit of the book. Alvarez is something of a transatlantic starlet of mildly sensationalist belles-lettres, who has been around for a while. In the early Seventies, his study of suicide, The Savage God, had carved up Sylvia Plath as one of the ?Extremists?, who, in the wake of the Cold War, nuclear threat and Vietnam, followed the ?logic? of her art to its ?desolate end?, thereby turning herself into the heroine of a myth that she herself had created. Trapped thus between sickness and greatness (her own as well as that of her famously craggy and erring husband, who happens to be a friend of our author) Plath had no choice but to turn to Alvarez, then the Observer poetry-editor, with a clutch of terminally brilliant poems, and other undefined and ambiguous demands. But his head was full of another woman then, so he left Sylvia to her mythic fate. All this is freely re-enacted in the recent Plath biopic and recounted with panache in Alvarez?s memoir. The title of this memoir ? Where Did It All Go Right? ? affords the best example of the combination of mediocre irreverence and flamboyant self-congratulation that characterizes his own public voice as a free-lance ?higher journalist? who has written on ?anything from suicide to poker, by way of divorce, dreams, offshore oil, and mountaineering?.

 Alvarez?s theory of writers ?finding? a voice runs together two contradictory notions. On the one hand, he starts with the idea of presence (?a voice with the whole weight of a life?) ? how a writer works out a way of actually being there in the text, and therefore in the head of his reader. This marks the convergence of ?tone? with the ?true-speaking self? as well as ?truth to feeling? (as if the two are interchangeable), in order to arrive at ?authenticity?, the very flower of the writer?s achievement. On the other hand, Alvarez keeps invoking, in worshipful terms, Coleridgean ?aloofness? and Eliot?s notion of the classical impersonality of art, the escape from emotion and personality. He also pays repeated homage to T.E. Hulme?s injunction to ?freshness? and ?seeing things as they are?, which enables Hulme to ?write like a man wholly at ease with himself?.

 The ?whole weight of a life? that Alvarez wants to feel behind the ?authentic? voice of a writer makes him a critic curiously given to pathologizing his subjects. Like Plath?s ?self-destructive? myth-making in The Savage God, Coleridge?s opium-addiction, John Berryman?s alcoholism and suicide, and Jean Rhys?s existential mess-making become, in this book, the whole ?point? of their writing and existence. This is a misplaced and unsound use of psychoanalysis that makes Alvarez posit an entirely predictable relationship between writing and its psychopathology. ?One sheds one?s sickness in books,? D.H. Lawrence had written. Alvarez disagrees: ?You don?t shed your sicknesses, you dredge them up in writing and thereby make them readily available to you, so that you find yourself living them out.? Interestingly, apart from Shakespeare, Coleridge and James, most of the writers who are made to fit such a notion of ?finding a voice? are second- to third-rate.

 Once Alvarez fixes on T.E. Hulme?s idea of being at ease with oneself as the surest sign of having found a voice, cringe-making disasters follow. The relationship between the writer and his art becomes a cheap romance, like falling in love and ?the tricky business of becoming an adult?: ?you hear a voice and you recognize it and know it?s for you just as surely as you recognize Miss Right across the room before you?ve ever spoken to her, even when ? or especially when ? she is hand in hand with Mr. Wrong.? Surely, finding Miss Right and easing with her into a life of facilities is the story of all that is irredeemably unremarkable beneath the visiting moon. Imagine Miss Right with Messrs Shakespeare, Goethe, Dostoevsky, Proust, Kafka, Mann, Wilde, Tagore, Auden, Mishima, White and Coetzee. Imagine her with the Misses Austen and Dickinson, and with the mad Mrs Woolf who heard the birds singing in Greek. The poor woman, as somebody said of Tom Driberg?s new wife, wouldn?t quite know which way to turn.

 ANOTHER TARGET

 Shock is an inestimably valuable weapon for murderers. A country grown tragically used to terrorism can be made to sit up in new terror when scientists are attacked, injured and killed within their haven when they are peacefully dispersing after a session during an international seminar. A fast, targeted operation with grenades and guns that causes terror and death is an act of terrorism, whether any direct link with known terrorist groups is found or not. It must be asked, in the want of specific answers, what exactly was achieved by the violence in the Indian Institute of Science campus in Bangalore. The delegates at the conference on operations research applications in infrastructure development comprised scientists from India and abroad, and the senior professor who died had received many awards for his work throughout his life. It is, perhaps, the apparent breakdown of normal logic that is ultimately the most terrifying. It is an indication that the unreason, which masquerades as reason in killers? minds, is almost impenetrable, and therefore, unpredictable.

 Yet it must also be asked if the attack on the IISc was entirely unpredictable. Not a week has passed since the arrest of four men, three in Bengal, which had led to the revelation of a plan to attack vital sectors, such as information technology companies and economic installations, in Hyderabad and Bangalore. But arrests from March onwards had repeatedly brought intelligence agencies across plans to target IT and knowledge industry hubs. Improved counter-terrorist strategies may have made attacks in conventional places less smooth. Things would have turned out differently if there had been a new awareness of possibilities among intelligence agencies. Although the IISc is an institution of learning, it is difficult to believe that nothing at all could have been done for security during an international seminar at a core institution in a city known to be a target. That would have protected the scientists from all attacks, terrorist or not. The timing of the attack was excellent; attention was focussed on security arrangements for Abu Salem, who had arrived in town that day. The professed targets now have a double value: there must be, for organized destroyers, a special satisfaction in hurting centres of knowledge and excellence. Intelligence agencies have a most difficult job in a country as vast and varied as India. But they cannot afford to be disconcerted. The price is too high.

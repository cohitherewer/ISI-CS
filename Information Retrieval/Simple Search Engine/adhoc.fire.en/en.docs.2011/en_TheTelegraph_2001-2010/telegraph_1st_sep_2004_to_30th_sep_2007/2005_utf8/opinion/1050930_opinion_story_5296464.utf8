 ON A LITTLE ISLAND

 Dark shadows

 The lighthouse 

 By P.D. James, 

 Faber and Faber, pound; 6.99

 James, as is her style, plays off the beauty and the calm of the place with human brutality. The island and its few inhabitants experience the gruesome murder of the highly acclaimed author, Nathan Oliver, who had been born on the island and had left it at the age of 16. The death, and its location, soon to be the site of a prime ministerial retreat, is too important to be left to the local constabulary.

 Enter Commander Dalgliesh, detective poet, lately turned committee man, and also, as readers of James will recall, very much in love with Emma Lavenham. His team consists of detective-inspector Kate Miskin and new entrant, sergeant Francis Benton-Smith. The old hand, detective-inspector Piers Tarrant, has left the team for the terrorist squad but reappears here as Kate?s lover.

 The team flies into the island by helicopter to investigate a ?suspicious death? which predictably turns out to be murder. Despite the rustic beauty of the island, and James?s evocation of it, the novel turns reflective with the author offering descriptions of the characters and their inner workings. The dramatis personae is small: five guests in all, one permanent resident (Emily Holcombe, the only surviving member of the family who owned the island) and the permanent staff who look after the island.

 The guest list consists of the victim, his daughter(Miriam), his copy editor-cum-secretary(Dennis Tremlett), a German diplomat (Dr Speidel) and a famous scientist (Dr Mark Yelland). None of the staff quite likes Nathan Oliver because he was seen as being rude and ungracious. Yelland had an argument with him at dinner on the night before the murder. Speidel had requested Nathan to meet him at the lighthouse where his dead body was found. And Emily was annoyed with Oliver because he wanted the cottage in which she lived. None of these, as Dalgliesh realizes, is a strong enough motive for murder, especially as a second killing comes close on the heels of the first.

 The key to the mystery lies in the island?s past and Dalgliesh begins to delve into this as he is stricken by flu that is suspected to be SARS which had already afflicted Dr Speidel. The closed atmosphere of the murder mystery is aggravated as the island is quarantined. As the fever leaves Dalgliesh, the pieces of the jigsaw fall into place in his mind, and Kate and Benton-Smith carry out the physical aspects of the investigation.

 The team has to stay on in the island to meet the requirements of the quarantine. The island slowly recovers its normalcy.

 Dalgliesh?s life will never be the same again as Emma decides to marry him. His life will have a different anchor from his job and his poetry. 

 For Kate, there is the promise of a new life with Piers Tarrant.

 For readers, there is the perpetual sense of wonder at James?s prose, her profound soundings of human character and motives and her contraposition of man and nature.

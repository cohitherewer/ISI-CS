 POOR QUALITY CONTROL

 Asokendu Sengupta

 The All India Council for Technical Education recently made its presence felt when it cut 38,000 seats in engineering and other professional courses. Aspiring engineers may thus find 6 per cent fewer seats this year. The axe has come down more heavily on the MCA course, which has lost about 16 per cent seats. The AICTE has asked 7 engineering colleges, 18 management institutes, and 65 MCA and 445 pharmacy colleges not to admit students in the new academic session. The University of Calcutta and Jadavpur University, have also been pulled up for their falling standards, especially for not recruiting the requisite number of teachers. 

 Clearly, technical and professional education in India is in a bad shape. A report even says that conditions in the prestigious Delhi School of Economics and some of the IITs are not much better. And this in a country that boasts of its pool of trained manpower. As far as numbers go, we are definitely ahead of others, but quality has undoubtedly been deteriorating fast. 

 The Centre is considering steps to bring DSE and the IITs back on the rails. That?s only to be expected, however, since these high-profile institutes are showpieces. But the story in graduate-level engineering colleges, run by private enterprises and universities, is completely different.

 Insatiable demand

 After independence, the country?s leaders woke up to the importance of technical education in national development. The AICTE was established in 1946 for this purpose. The first and second five-year plans gave a lot of priority to technical education and substantial funds were laid aside for setting up new institutions and developing existing ones. 

 The demand for technical education rose steadily. In 1947-48 the capacity of engineering colleges in India was 2,940 ? by the end of the third plan, it had reached 25,000. But it was impossible for the government to match this demand, since higher and professional education requires a lot of investment. So in the second plan, it was decided that private agencies would be encouraged to set up engineering colleges. The government provided 50 per cent of the recurring and non-recurring expenditure as grant-in-aid, besides interest-free loans for construction of hostels. In order to maintain standards, the AICTE was given the power to control these private institutes. 

 The demand for technical education escalated further. Taking advantage of this, state governments and private bodies have set up new institutions with or without AICTE approval. Experts warned that the mushrooming of technical institutes would jeopardize quality but the government did not heed them. As a result, technical education suffered. 

 Market mechanics

 Technical education is a highly profitable business because of its demand in the job market. But it requires high initial investment over a long period. Unfortunately, unscrupulous businessmen are out to make a fast buck. Usually, they don?t invest much on infrastructure but demand a huge sum at the time of admission in the form of donation or capitation fees. Thus many of these institutes do not have laboratories or workshops, library facilities, competent teachers, academic and hostel buildings. Yet, the AICTE did not say a word.

 It is only now that the AICTE seems to have waken up and undertaken a repair job. The measure it has taken in this direction is important but not adequate. It has to do a lot more to ensure that higher technical education in India maintains a certain quality. Universities and other academic bodies, even consumer forums, have a role to play in this. They must step in because in this age of globalization, nobody is interested in numbers ? only quality sells.

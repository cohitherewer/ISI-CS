 WITH A FOOT IN THE DOOR

 Gwynne Dyer

 The near-tie in the German election, in which chancellor Gerhard Schroeder came from 13 percentage points behind conservative challenger, Angela Merkel, in late August to less than one point behind her by the vote on September 18, has thrown German politics into turmoil. But one thing is clear. The door through which Turkey hopes to enter the European Union, which Merkel had promised to slam shut, is still open. 

 Merkel launched a high-profile campaign last month to block Turkey?s entry into the European Union, sending letters to EU leaders in other countries asking them to offer Turkey not full membership but only ?privileged partnership?. ?We are firmly convinced,? she wrote, ?that Turkey?s membership would overtax the EU economically and socially and endanger the process of European integration.? In other words, Turks are poor, they?re Muslim, and there are far too many of them.

 Bad faith

 It was a cynical appeal to the anti-Turkish and anti-Muslim prejudices of German voters who are already uncomfortable with the growing diversity of their country, and fear a further influx of immigrants if Turkey joins the EU. It was also a bit late in the day to raise such objections, since Turkey has been a recognized candidate for full EU membership for the past six years. But if Merkel had become the leader of a majority government in Germany, the biggest country in the EU, the Turks would have been betrayed and rejected once again.

 Turkey has tied itself in knots to meet the EU?s standards for membership. That has been good for the Turks, who now live in a far more just, equal and democratic country than they did a decade ago. But they do feel that they have kept their side of the bargain, and only six months ago all three of the most powerful EU countries, Germany, France and Britain, firmly backed Turkey?s membership. But then came the French and Dutch votes that rejected the proposed new EU constitution, and the whole scene turned sour.

 To make matters worse, Turkey announced that while it would sign a customs deal opening up trade with all 25 EU members, it would still not recognize the government of the republic of Cyprus, one of the ten countries that joined the EU in May, 2004. French president Jacques Chirac promptly tried to turn that declaration into a proof of Turkish bad faith, insisting that it ?proposes political and legal problems and is not in the spirit expected of a candidate to the Union.?

 Good times ahead

 Even the start of Turkey?s membership talks early next month was looking in doubt. Cheat the Turks on that and they would surely walk away, abandoning the vision of a broader Europe that rises above the old mutual fear and suspicion between Christians and Muslims, and also ending all hope that countries east of Turkey, like Georgia and Armenia, might one day qualify for EU membership. The situation looked pretty grim ? and then Angela Merkel stumbled.

 She may yet end up as chancellor at the head of some awkward three-party coalition but it would not be the kind of strong, cohesive government that could impose a de facto German veto on Turkish membership of the EU. And it could even be the Comeback Kid himself, Gerhard Schroeder, a strong supporter of Turkey, who forms the next government.

 As for Cyprus, EU ambassadors agreed in Brussels that while Ankara must eventually recognize the government of Cyprus, that can happen at any point in the entry negotiations, which are expected to last up to ten years. That leaves plenty of time for a settlement that includes Turkish-Cypriots too, so Ankara will go along with it. One more crisis has been surmounted, and the talks will begin in October as planned.

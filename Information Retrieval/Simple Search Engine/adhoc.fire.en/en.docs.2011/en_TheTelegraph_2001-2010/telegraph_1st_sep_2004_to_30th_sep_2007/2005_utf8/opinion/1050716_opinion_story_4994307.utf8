 HONESTY IS GOOD POLITICS

 The winds of change have now caught West Bengal?s political sails. Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s admission in the legislative assembly that the municipal elections in Calcutta and Salt Lake were not totally free and fair is evidence that the chief minister is adopting a new attitude towards the political process. The economy of the state has already felt the difference that Mr Bhattacharjee has brought to the overall climate of investment. But even among Mr Bhattacharjee?s many admirers there was a question-mark about his intentions to change the political practice of his comrades. His admissions to the assembly are breathtaking in their honesty and in their implications.

 Mr Bhattacharjee said that the elections were not free of malpractice. This is a comment on what his party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), is prone to doing during elections, on the manipulation and the coercion in which the cadre engage. The chief minister added that he had asked the police to be neutral. The implication is that on previous occasions the police have not been neutral. Further, what kind of police force has to be told to remain neutral? The police should enforce law and order and not serve their political masters. This is a comment on the extent to which the police and the administration have been politicized and made to serve the interests of the CPI(M). Mr Bhattacharjee told the assembly that his party colleagues had been instructed not to be on the streets on election day to help party candidates in various ways. The fact that CPI(M) leaders had to be given such instructions is suggestive of the political practice of those leaders. Mr Bhattacharjee has, in fact, directly or by implication, agreed with all the criticisms that have been made of the way the left conducts elections. He may not agree with the scale of the criticisms, but he has admitted that elections are not free, that the police are not neutral and cadre dominate the streets and the booths.

 What is even more heartening than Mr Bhattacharjee?s truthfulness is the support his statement has received from Mr Anil Biswas, the secretary of the CPI(M) in West Bengal. Mr Biswas?s concurrence with Mr Bhattacharjee shows a willingness of the party also to refashion itself. The reasons for this transformation show a certain political canniness. There is a realization that investment is not just a matter of economic confidence. Investors also need to have faith in the political establishment. Mr Bhattacharjee and Mr Biswas are trying to secure that faith. Turning moderate is also a shrewd move to raid West Bengal?s solid non-left vote bank. Non-left voters are now lost with the decline of Ms Mamata Banerjee and the utter incompetence of the Congress in the state. By securing investment and becoming politically moderate, Mr Bha-ttacharjee stands a good chance of winning some of the non-left votes. The left votes will remain with him anyway. He has nothing to lose by his honesty.

 SPY WHO LOVED MARTINI

 Fleming?s gift to women

 James Bond The Man and His World: The Official Companion to Ian Fleming?s Creation By Henry Chancellor, John Murray, ? 12.50

 No fictional character, after Sherlock Holmes, has captured the popular imagination as James Bond did. He became an icon. This book is obligatory reading for Bond fans. It brings together the essential aspects of Bond?s life and lifestyle. For good measure Chancellor also provides details of the life of Ian Fleming, and shows which features of Fleming?s life, personality and experiences influenced the creation of the secret agent 007.

 Some features of Fleming?s life are worth noting. He was an Old Etonian who went to Sandhurst. He dreamed of joining the Foreign Office. He failed and ended up by joining Reuters. His career there was not particularly distinguished and in his despatches he showed a cavalier disregard for facts. He once wrote from Moscow, ?Tonight thousands of enemies of the Soviet State are skulking in cellars, gnashing their teeth.? When it was pointed out to him that very few Moscow houses had cellars, Fleming retorted, ?My dear fellow, don?t let?s worry too much about that. It?s the sense of the thing that matters, and evil-doers always gnash their teeth and skulk in cellars.? A similar indifference to reality would be the hallmark of the Bond novels in which the narrative flow compels a willing suspension of disbelief.

 Fleming?s dreams were partially fulfilled during World War II when he became personal assistant to the director of naval intelligence. This was Fleming?s only exposure to the secret world. The world that he created around 007 and his boss M was a highly coloured version of reality, except for the fact that the head of the British secret service is traditionally referred to as C. There was an element of wish-fulfilment in the Bond novels. Fleming wanted to retrieve aspects of British valour and heroism especially after the Suez debacle of 1956.

 Fleming thus made Bond larger than life ? ruggedly handsome, wearing expensive clothes and driving fast cars. He smoked custom-made cigarettes, made the perfect martini; his golf was good, shooting excellent and he was outstanding in cards and gambling. He was irresistible to women. He was also knowledgeable about food, wine and restaurants. Chancellor makes a list of Bond?s favourites. His favourite restaurant in France is the modest-looking place opposite the train station in Etaples run by Monsieur Becaud where he eats turbot poche, sauce mousseline, and half a roast partridge. Among his favourite foods are eggs Benedict, stone crabs, caviar, lobster and partridge. His favourite perfume is Ode by Guerlin and his favourite book Hogan on Golf. An attentive reader of Bond with a good memory can get to know the high life of Europe of a period without ever having stirred out of his armchair. Now Chancellor?s companion can be a handy aide memoire. 

 The book is full of delightful trivia about Bond and his creator. They might appear useless but to a Bond afficianado, these are nuggets of gold. Who else would like to know that both Fleming and Bond were clients of Floris, the famous perfumer in Jermyn Street?

 Chancellor?s research delves into Fleming?s private notes and letters as well as into his stories and novels, catching the Fleming-Bond duo within the covers of one book.

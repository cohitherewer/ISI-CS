 BATTLING A MAN?S WORLD 

Countering gender violence: Initiatives towards collective 

action in Rajasthan 

By Kanchan Mathur, 

Sage, Rs 680

Patriarchy devises new ways of generating and perpetuating 

a power structure favourable to it. But power as a concept is multilayered and 

complex. Theories in gender studies point out that there are forces at work against 

patriarchy even though it appears to be commonplace in most societies.

 In this book, Kanchan Mathur gives an example of how the twin evils of patriarchy and feudal oppression are being fought in rural Rajasthan. The author conducts a survey on the initiatives undertaken by women to empower the victims of this oppression.

 Mathur concentrates on the psychological aspects of the process which contributes to the mobilization of agencies against patriarchy. For this, says Mathur, a researcher has to be actively involved in the field. Mathur alters the participatory research methodology radically so that her research subjects are encouraged to interact freely.

 Significantly, the book not only recounts Mathur?s research experiences but it also defines the phenomenon of gender violence. Strategies to eliminate this malaise have also been identified. Mathur specifies four domains in which this violence operates in rural Rajasthan ? family, community, market-workplace, and the state. The first three impose prescriptive norms on women?s behaviour. The fourth, interestingly, avows complicity to the value system that women internalize through the process of socialization. Weak laws, an indifferent judiciary and a corrupt police force make matters worse for the victims of oppression.

 Violence against women, according to the author, can be broadly grouped into the following categories ? physical, mental, sexual and economic. These categories, writes Mathur, often overlap with one another. Practices such as sati, the purdah, bride price, and the branding of women as witches, especially in tribal societies, are a few examples of gender oppression that Mathur talks about with the help of various case studies.

 There are traces of optimism in Mathur?s book though. For instance, she talks about the good work done by non government organizations, the Women?s Development Programme and sathins to stem violence against women in villages. 

 The book would be of interest to those scouting for information about gender relations in Rajasthan. It also chronicles the extraordinary tales of individual resistance against male domination and how these operate against overwhelming odds.

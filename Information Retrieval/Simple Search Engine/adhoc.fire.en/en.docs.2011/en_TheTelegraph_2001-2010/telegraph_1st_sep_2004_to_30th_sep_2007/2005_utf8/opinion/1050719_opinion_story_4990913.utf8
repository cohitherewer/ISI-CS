 Letters to Editor

 Prosper, don?t grow

 Sir ? When the government of India launched its family planning programme in 1952, the prescribed methods of vasectomy, tubectomy, induced abortion and contraception met with lukewarm response among its target receptors. There were impeding religious factors, and illiteracy and poverty prevented the programme from being successful. There were recent efforts to revive the 79th amendment bill to prevent those with more than two children from contesting elections, holding public office and even reserving seats in public transport (?Two to travel?, July 8). One wonders if these disincentives will be effective. For one, the bar on contesting elections will not hold. Politics is still a family-run enterprise in India where members do not usually worry about ?norms?. As for the other suggestions, as the editorial itself points out, the democratic policymakers would be well-advised to think twice.

 The two-child norm is not feasible in a country like India. Harsh family control measures adopted during Emergency have already proved how ineffectual they can be. Any party which imposes them will be writing its own obituary. But certain steps have to be taken, and irrespective of religious divides and prescriptions.

 Yours faithfully,

Subhankar Mukherjee, Borehat, Burdwan

 Sir ? Is population control the one and only solution to all ills plaguing us?Is it the reason for our deteriorating moral and material life? If the answer is yes, then all other grand projects should be suspended and attention turned to curbing population growth. To begin with, there has to be a change of attitude towards sex, which should be seen less as a means of procreation and more as a source of pleasure. To limit population, the government can offer to take care of the basic needs of the first child of couples who do not have a second child within the next five years. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sushant, Calcutta

 Sir ? What is the use of celebrating World Population Day if we do not appreciate the reason behind it? The population explosion in China and India is a curse for the countries. To add to it are problems like gender inequality and illiteracy. The planning commission and several other monitoring agencies in India have failed to come up with a solution. We need a more comprehensive policy.

 Yours faithfully,

Ashish Kumar Mohanty, 

 Cuttack

 Sir ? The Union health minister, A. Ramadoss, should be sacked because he is imposing his own whims by advocating self-regulation in matters of family planning. It is senseless to waste public money on incentives for family planning when the target can be achieved through disincentives and withdrawal of government facilities like ration or reservation for jobs or promotion. Voting rights may be denied to people who have more than two children. All women going for delivery in hospitals (government or private) may be compulsorily sterilized after the second 

 delivery. 

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba

 Sir ? The small family norm is still a distant dream for India which has a population of nearly 1.62 billion. The child-per-mother ratio is currently at 3.3, far above the desired level, and particularly so for Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Bihar. Our policymakers seem to be living in a fool?s paradise, having convinced themselves that the socio-economic uplift of the country will bring the birth rate down. Perhaps we need to go back to Sanjay Gandhi?s carrot and stick policy.

 Yours faithfully,

Saikat Pandit, Hooghly

 Fresh flowers

 Sir ? The report, ?Scent of bloom late in Bihar? (July 14), left one amazed at the determination of Rina Kumari, the little girl from a Bihar leper colony who took on fate. While an overwhelming majority of our so-called ?modern? youth have no dreams beyond possessing a pair of designer jeans and mini-skirts at the cost of their parents, it is people like Rina who keep our hopes alive. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Subhanjan Sengupta, Durgapur

 Sir ? It is all very fine to see Rina Kumari bloom in distant Scotland, but this flower would do well to stay back in the cooler climes than return to the heat and dust of Bihar. For even before Rina has taken her final exams, there is talk of getting her married and settled down. She is expected to help, but her neighbours are spiteful of her success. How will the flower retain its freshness?

 Yours faithfully,

J. Acharya, Calcutta

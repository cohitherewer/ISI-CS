 EYES, LAUGHTER AND GREATNESS

 Sharing a joke

 Eyes and laughter ? this is the strongest impression that Nemai Ghosh?s series of photographs on Satyajit Ray and Binode Bihari Mukherjee leaves behind. The remarkable collection of sixty-six photographs, taken during Ray?s filming of The Inner Eye, his documentary on the blind artist, makes palpable the special quality of Ray?s and Binode Bihari?s engagement with each other. It is relaxed yet intense, two great artists ? one once the other?s teacher ? meeting after a long time, talking, looking, listening, reflecting. In his foreword to the volume, Andrew Robinson quotes from a letter Ray wrote to Marie Seton, referring to the general lack of knowledge and understanding about the painter: ?His total lack of flamboyance may have had something to do with it?.I have always felt a great affinity with him.? 

 Nemai Ghosh?s camera, however much he deplores the quality of his efforts, captures even more. The shared enjoyment of filmmaker and painter stems from the excitement of work. There is a film in the making, and the subject himself is shown at work, his mobile face still and exploring fingers poised, as the director finds, chooses, ponders, instructs, and discovers. Ray looks at Binode Bihari through his lens, and Ghosh looks at both, together and apart. Soumendu Roy, Ray?s cameraman, and the artist Dinkar Kowshik, who writes the introduction, are often present. The drama of sight, outward and inward, could not have been rendered with greater purity. Ghosh?s own vision shaping the series can perhaps be traced back to the first moment he saw the two men together. He says in the preface: ?The blind painter looked at his former student. Even through the impenetrable darkness of his glasses, he seemed to see Satyajit; his inner vision was focussed ? still and unwavering ? on him. Both had much to say to each other, many questions to ask. Above all, there was happiness in the air, and endless laughter.?

 Ghosh captures the two faces again and again, each time anew. There is the tall man, his rugged and penetrating face turned towards every new possibility, his eyes lustrous or pensive, as he explores not just Santiniketan and Binode Bihari?s favourite khoyai, but also Kathmandu and Varanasi, where the painter had also lived and worked. But the quiet, slowly moving or seated painter in his dark glasses is an equally vibrant presence, as his humorous face creases in thought or pleasure. In repose, there is a quality of stillness about him that Ghosh?s camera interprets as intense absorption. Around him lie the paraphernalia of his everyday existence, while his former student gazes at his murals and frescoes for the best angle, or sifts through his unframed paintings. The few sketches that have been reproduced convey the miracle of Binode Bihari?s ?insight? ? which he himself happily attributes to Ray ? and the unwavering steadiness and grace of his hand. The volume is an exhilarating memory of two of India?s greatest artists.

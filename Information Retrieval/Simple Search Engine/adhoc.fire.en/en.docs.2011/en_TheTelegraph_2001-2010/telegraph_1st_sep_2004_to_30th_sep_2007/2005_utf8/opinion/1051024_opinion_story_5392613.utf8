 Letters to Editor

 At the trial

 Sir ? The trial of Saddam Hussein has begun. The former Iraqi president is accused of killing 143 Shiite Muslims. But the trial is not above question. Although he is being tried in an Iraqi court, the process is obviously controlled by American agents. The great paradox is that while Saddam Hussein is being tried for killing 143 people, George W. Bush is roaming scot-free in spite of being the cause of the death of many more people in Iraq and Afghanistan. Bush justifies the invasion of Iraq and toppling of Saddam Hussein on the grounds that Iraq possesses weapons of mass destruction. But the United States of America possesses the same, perhaps in larger quantities than Iraq ever could. Bush has recently come out with the statement that god instructed him to invade Iraq. How is he then any different from Osama bin Laden who also claims to have bombed the twin towers on god?s orders? Factually speaking, the US is responsible for the deaths of many more innocent people than any other country in the world. The rest of the world should make sure that Bush is tried by the International Criminal Court.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? No foreign power has the right to dictate what should be done with the deposed leader of a sovereign country. If Saddam Hussein has committed crimes against humanity, he should be tried by an international tribunal. The verdict of the kangaroo court sponsored by the US to try Saddam Hussein is a foregone conclusion. While the US has spent millions to train the prosecutors to present the case, the lawyers representing the accused have been denied time and access to information. It is George W. Bush who should be brought to trial for killing thousands of innocent Iraqis in the name of liberating their country.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Saddam Hussein is not wrong in asking Rizgar Mohammed Amin, the chief judge in his trial ? ?Who are you? What are you?? (?Saddam breathes fire at trial?, Oct 20) What is the purpose behind conducting this elaborate farce of a trial? Everyone knows that it is not a trial by the Iraqis but by the US government, which will find Saddam Hussein guilty and hang him. 

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? The legality of the court set up to try Saddam Hussein for ?crimes? committed two decades back is indeed questionable. Here is an ?accused? whose country was attacked without provocation by foreign powers and who was made to leave his constitutional position and authority. The trial, though desperately being made to appear lawful, has been manoeuvred by the occupation forces. What genre of international law is this? Amidst all the glib talk of the big powers on democracy, freedom, human rights and so on, it is well known that they are the biggest violators of the lofty principles that they claim to espouse. A democracy imposed and enforced on the strength of arms will remain as fragile and fraudulent as it will be suspect and satanic in the eyes of the international community. By holding out threats and resorting to strong-arm tactics, the big powers are in fact pointing out the inadequacies of democracy to cope with the challenges of a changing world.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Saddam Hussein is, technically, perfectly right in claiming that he is still the president of Iraq. After all, the invasion of Iraq was illegal. It was not only launched without UN authorization but was in complete violation of the UN Charter which says that armed force can be used without UN approval only when the purpose is self-defence. In any case, the ?trial? is a farce, whose verdict is foreordained. It is conducted in a court in a country under occupation, by judges ?trained? by the occupiers. It owes its very existence to the fact of the occupation. 

 All excuses for the occupation have already been exploded. The Bush-Blair duo must at least show that they have ?liberated? Iraq from tyranny, so the show trial will go on to a conviction and execution. No mention will be made of the fact that when Saddam committed the alleged ?crimes?, he was the US?s biggest ally in the region. A little tip for the Indian government here: the US?s ?friendship? has a very short shelf-life when ?friends? pass their sell-by date.

 Yours faithfully,

B. Purkayastha, Shillong 

 Sir ? The verdict of Saddam Hussein?s trial could well become the biggest mockery of the 21st century. And now the kidnapping and killing of Saadoun Janabi, one of Saddam?s team of lawyers, enforces people?s worst fears about a biased and unfair trial (?Saddam lawyer found executed?, Oct 22). Whatever the shape of global terrorism today, the US is the single biggest architect of it. But the question is, who will bring it to trial?

 Yours faithfully,

Shubhajit Chakraborty, Calcutta

 WORK MORE IF YOU WANT TO EARN MORE 

 Productivity-linked wages may be one way to reconcile the desire for profits with the concern for workers? well-being, writes S.S. Chawdhry

 Direct action

 The recent Supreme Court judgment, endorsing the dismissal of a worker for sleeping on duty, brings to the fore the need for productivity-linked wages in India. Increasingly, in the organized sector, wages ? especially that of permanent employees ? have come to mean fixed, regular payments unconnected to productivity. It is only in the unorganized sector that an under-performing employee gets paid less, or is sacked. 

 With economic liberalization, the Indian government has started withdrawing from running industries. Units which were earlier run under government patronage and whose losses were funded by the national exchequer, are being divested and forced to fend for themselves. Under the circumstances, wages too must be linked to some pre-determined quantum of production. Failure to do this will make our products uncompetitive in the world market.

 In West Bengal, from 1969 onwards, there have been several agreements between the management, trade unions and the government in sectors like engineering, jute and tea. But in no settlement has a sincere effort been made to link wages to productivity. The jute industry did make some headway in this direction in 2002, but long-prevailing prejudices and mistrust ensured that little progress was made. The problem is that our political leaders do not want to take any steps in this direction for fear of losing popularity in the short run. Linking wages to productivity will not only help reward honest and sincere workmen, but it is also the only way to meet the rising expectations of Indian workers and the needs of the developing Indian economy.

 A ?productivity agreement? may be one way for managements and unions to find a middle path between the desire for profits and concern for workers? well-being. In this regard, an experiment carried out in the Sixties at the Fawley refinery of the Esso Petroleum Company in the United Kingdom is worth recalling. An agreement between the management and union there attempted to link wages and working conditions to workers? efforts to improve the performance of the company. The results were a 40-45 per cent increase in productivity, a substantial increase in wages, control on overtime, reduction in manpower through voluntary separation schemes, and a shortened work week, resulting in a saving of 10 per cent in the wage bill. 

 As in India now, the challenge before the British economy in the Sixties was how to compete effectively in the international market. To meet the situation, the British National Board of Prices and Incomes put a freeze on wage increases of over 3.5 per cent, if they were not accompanied by an increase in productivity. India, which is changing from a protected economy to one based on open competition, needs similar measures. The country also has greater need for higher productivity, given the large-scale poverty here, than the West. Paradoxically, productivity in India appears to be a much-talked-about but little-applied strategy for growth. The consequences are not far to seek ? the swelling ranks of the unemployed and underemployed. But employers and employees refuse to face these harsh realities, which is why India does not have a national wage policy even now. 

 The right to organize and bargain collectively by bringing to bear the weight of numbers on the employer might have been justified some decades ago. But workers are now protected by various labour laws abridging the rights of employers. The state has taken upon itself to safeguard the well-being of the working classes by guaranteeing minimum wages, regulating work conditions and providing a whole range of statutory social security and welfare measures. The trade unions will have to recognize now that workers in the organized sector in India are no longer economically weak. They will have to change their focus in the interest of rapid economic development. 

 Prima facie, there is need to link revisions in wages to the index of national prosperity, as also the worker?s contribution to higher productivity in his unit. ?Productivity agreements? might be the solution here. 

 But all such agreements must be local agreements relating to one enterprise in one location. They must also be comprehensive in scope combining, as far as possible, all that the management wants from employees in return for all that the employees want from the management. Disagreements regarding productivity can be resolved by independent experts from the local or national productivity councils. Such productivity-linked wage agreements must lay emphasis on the withdrawal of restrictive work practices on the part of the workers and unions.

 The unions must accept the management?s right to redeploy excess manpower, and conduct work evaluation studies. They should also accept the management?s need to reduce manpower where they cannot be redeployed or gainfully employed through voluntary retirement schemes, and to step up production or capacity utilization by linking it with wage increases. 

 But first, the constraints of the existing political economy must be done away with. The trade unions must be convinced that in the ultimate analysis the road to more wages, better work conditions, and a higher standard of living comes via higher productivity and profit to enterprises. They must realize that the quest for higher productivity will demand from them decisions which may not always be popular. What we need today is the realization on the part of the government, unions and the management that if the industry has to survive, productivity must go up. And that means, no sleeping on the job.

 Letters to Editor

 Backwards and forwards

 Sir ? Mayavati is undoubtedly the queen of the backward classes. No wonder the prosperous section of her ?subjects? bought coupons ranging from Rs 50 to 1,000 to make up a birthday gift of Rs 10 crore for her (?Funds, but no friends for Mayavati?, Jan 16). It?s good to see that some of her subjects, at least, are prospering. According to Mayavati, the donations were ?khoon pasina ka paisa? and not the ill-gotten wealth of industrialists ? as if other parties receive money from industrialists only and not from the common people. Whether the industrialists get money from the poor and transfer part of it to parties, or Mayavati gets it from them directly ? what is the difference? Remember the ?queen? of Nancowrie in tsunami-hit Nicobar, who refused to leave for better treatment elsewhere, and still goes fishing in the high seas with her subjects, at the age of 73? Who is the real queen?

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

 Exemplary punishment

 Sir ? In a country where it may take upto 14 years for a rapist and murderer to be punished (as in Dhananjoy Chatterjee?s case), it is indeed heartening that the Delhi court has sentenced two men accused of raping a medical student within two years (?Life term in pace-setting rape case,? Jan 18). The Indian judiciary seems to have started functioning at last. The case is notable also because the trial was in camera. Such prompt justice may lead to a reduction in the number of rape cases. It may also help women regain faith in the law and the police, which cooperated with the victim and counselled her to come forward and testify. But speedy justice alone won?t help rape victims in India. How is she to escape the social-stigma? It is time socially-conscious individuals speak up for rape victims. Instead of shunning the victim, we must ostracize the rapists who forced a helpless girl into a life of shame. 

 Yours faithfully,

Anjan Chatterjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? The life imprisonment given by the Delhi court will boost the morale of the victim and her family. But in a country where rapes seem to go up every year, fast and in camera trials should have come into effect long ago. 

 Yours faithfully,

Dipro Ray, Calcutta

 Sir ? A spell in prison, however long it may be, is not enough to arrest the rising cases of crime against women. A rapist ?degrades? women, but does he feel guilty for his actions? Criminals like Rahul and Amit should be dealt a more severe punishment.

 Yours faithfully,

Jatindranath Bhowmick, Kalyani

 Sir ? Rape cases should be disposed of even quicker, say within six-months, to reduce further agony to the victims. The judiciary should have separate sections for such cases where in camera trials are mandatory and the media should not be allowed to reveal the identity of victims. 

 Yours faithfully

Boddhayan Bhowmick, Calcutta

 Pat on the back

 Sir ? Just as Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee ignored his party-line to praise Subrata Mukherjee for his good work, conceding that the Calcutta mayor had done ?what his government could not?, the people of West Bengal too must come forward to support his development proposals, which are opposed by his own party (?Development first, says CM?, Jan 19). This is reminiscent of Bidhan Chandra Roy, the architect of post-independence West Bengal, but then Roy had more freedom to act than Bhattacharjee. However, given the partisan attitudes at the village level, one hopes his commitment to the uplift of the poor reaches those who do not belong to his party. Bhattacharjee must heed his party?s advice on development issues, but he should also consider forming a senior citizens? body comprising eminent but retired specialists, for their pragmatic views. 

 No doubt, the present chief minister is different and the state can look forward to a bright future, unless he is shunted out by the dogmatic lobby in his party. 

 Yours faithfully,

Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The news report about the CMC getting A+ credit rating for improved tax collection rang hollow. One of its so-called ?success? stories is property tax. But does it make any sense to increase taxes on properties that are encumbered with tenants who continue to pay rents at rates prevalent thirty years ago? Especially as such tenants are usually state and Central government offices, which not only continue to stay on against the wishes of the owners, but they have refused to raise rents and also misuse and deface the property. If the state government has made plans to consolidate all its office space (outside Writers? Buildings) in the Salt Lake area, why are some offices being allowed to continue in their original location? Can?t these lazy babus be made to move to the space designated for them? 

 Yours faithfully,

Subash Majumdar, California

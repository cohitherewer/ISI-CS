 THE CASUAL MOMENT 

 - The mysterious, indefinable quality of poetry 

 TELLING TALES / AMIT CHAUDHURI

 A scene from John 

 Ford?s Stagecoach 

 I always find it a bit surprising 

 when I hear the directors and producers of Hindi films say, 

 ?This one is very good ? it?s almost as good as Hollywood.? 

 I realize it?s probably a quality of professionalism, a 

 technical finesse, they have in mind; because, creatively, 

 mainstream Hollywood cinema today is arguably the least 

 interesting and most infantile cinema being made anywhere. 

 Its success might be an object of emulation ? but does it 

 compel admiration in any other sense?

 For ever since we can remember, 

 Hollywood has not only been a principal producer, but the 

 chief definition of popular cinema. But, in the last twenty 

 years or so, it has become more: it has become, almost unobtrusively, 

 a universal type. I feel this especially when I am in the 

 DVD and video section of a book or music shop in Britain 

 ? there is cinema; and then, in a corner, there is ?world? 

 cinema. What?s happened to the adjective ?world? here is 

 striking: robbed, both physically and conceptually, of size, 

 volume, and mastery, of the glamour it possesses in other 

 conjunctions (?world famous?, ?world class?), it?s become 

 a ghost of itself, an uncharacteristically minor term. The 

 ?world? is an obscure and down-at-heel suburb of Hollywood 

 which people, these days, visit infrequently.

 The transformation of Hollywood 

 into a universal has been appropriate to its role in the 

 unipolar world, as a sort of statist art form in an age 

 in which states are disappearing; but it has cost it artistically. 

 When I say ?artistic?, I have a particular notion of the 

 word in mind, a notion that was only fully expressed by 

 20th-century modernism and its various tributaries, but 

 which has been at work in the domain of art across time 

 and cultures: the idea that the ?universal? in art is in 

 constant tension with the particular, the random, the aleatory.

 In an intriguing little essay, 

 ?The Sacred Circulation of National Images?, the social 

 scientist Partha Chatterjee is puzzled and engrossed by 

 what has happened to these ?national images? ? for instance, 

 the Taj Mahal; Shah Jahan?s Red Fort ? as they?ve been represented 

 in our textbooks in the last forty or fifty years: that 

 is, in our relatively brief, but palpably long, history 

 as a republic. 

 Chatterjee discovers that early 

 photographs and engravings found in textbooks dating back, 

 say, to the Twenties, are gradually replaced in textbooks 

 after 1947 by a certain kind of line drawing. He finds no 

 economic raison d??tre for this change: ?Are they 

 cheaper to print? Not really; both are printed from zinc 

 blocks made by the same photographic process.? But the more 

 telling change occurs in the nature of the representations 

 themselves, as the pictures of certain monuments are transformed 

 into ?national icons?. The earlier pictures and photos, 

 Chatterjee finds, have an element of the random in their 

 composition ? an engraving of the Taj Mahal has a nameless 

 itinerant before it; an early photograph shows a scattering 

 of ?native? visitors before the same building; early pictures 

 of the Red Fort or the ghats in Benaras have the 

 same sort of ?redundant? detail in the foreground. 

 As these monuments are turned 

 into ?national icons? in post-Independence history textbooks, 

 the pictures are emptied of signs of randomness, emptied, 

 indeed, of all but the monument itself, and a new credo 

 and economy of representation comes into existence: ?There 

 must be no hint of the picturesque or the painterly, no 

 tricks of the camera angle, no staging of the unexpected 

 or the exotic. The image must also be shorn of all redundancy...? 

 Although Chatterjee places this ?emptying? of the textbook 

 image in the context of the Indian nation-state, and identifies 

 this as a process by which national monuments are turned 

 to ?sacred? images, its impetus seems as much Platonic as 

 nationalist: a nostalgia for the ideal likeness, unvitiated 

 by reality?s unpredictability.

 Something similar has happened 

 to Hollywood in the last twenty five years: an iconization 

 has taken place; in the meanwhile, the aleatory has been 

 steadily suppressed. If you study a frame in a contemporary 

 Hollywood movie, you note how it?s been denuded of the random, 

 the redundant, of what Barthes, looking at stills from Eisenstein, 

 called the irreducible ?third meaning?; even the incidental 

 details ? a stall selling newspapers or fruit on a street 

 ? are a premeditated part of the design. This is the transformation 

 of Hollywood from art or entertainment into, to borrow from 

 Chatterjee, a ?sacred circulation of images? in our globalized 

 present; from cinema to a platonic likeness of cinema (?true-blue 

 cinema?, to quote a film critic in The Telegraph 

 in a review of the film Black); and more. What is 

 revealing is how easily people have accepted this sacralization, 

 and how few have remarked on the passing of the random from 

 ?true-blue cinema?.

 As a reader (and writer) who has 

 a particular investment in the occurrence of the redundant 

 and the random in a work of art, I find revealing the disappearance 

 of these elements from some of the major art forms in the 

 world we now live in. ?Much of the best things in a [John] 

 Ford film,? said his devotee, Satyajit Ray, in 1973 after 

 Ford?s death, ?has the mysterious, indefinable quality of 

 poetry. Because some of them appear casual ? even accidental 

 ? it is difficult to realise how much experience and mastery 

 lie behind them.?

 And then he provides an instance, 

 a ?moment?, from a Ford film, Fort Apache. ?Two men 

 stand talking on the edge of a deep ravine. There is a broken 

 bottle lying alongside. One man gives it a casual kick and 

 sends it flying over the edge. A few seconds later, in a 

 gap in the conversation, the sound track registers the faintest 

 of clinks. That?s all. This is the sort of thing that belongs 

 uniquely to the cinema. What it does is to invest a casual 

 moment with poetic significance. Those who look for ?meaning? 

 here, whether symbolic or literary, and are disappointed 

 not to find it, are obviously unaware of what make for poetry 

 in the cinema.?

 Ray?s description here is itself 

 composed in a language of the aleatory ? ?accidental?; ?faintest?; 

 ?that?s all?; the repetition, three times, of ?casual?. 

 The elegy for Ford is an elegy for a certain kind of sensibility 

 that cinema ? even mainstream Hollywood cinema ? once accommodated; 

 for Ford was a commercial filmmaker; like the person who, 

 in the Twenties, made the engraving of the Taj Mahal with 

 the single itinerant before it, he, on his own admission, 

 was doing a ?job?. Ray begins his tribute with a speculation 

 ? ?either Ford did not think of himself as an artist?, or, 

 as Ray believes, possessed such confidence in his mastery 

 that he didn?t worry about the pedestrian commissions he 

 sometimes took up. One might wonder, similarly, about the 

 person who made that early engraving. On the one hand, it?s 

 just another textbook picture; on the other, it?s lit with 

 the instinct for the casual that makes it unrepeatable.

 PACING IT OUT

 The long-awaited slowdown in India Inc?s frenetic pace of growth has finally arrived. Corporate results for the September quarter show a marked deceleration in both revenue and profit growth. Rising input costs, especially of raw materials, power and fuel and the absence of the boost to the bottomline from falling interest rates have resulted in a squeeze in margins. At the same time, higher levels of capacity utilization and the effect of a high base have resulted in making topline growth difficult. The upshot has been slower sales and profit growth. Clearly, in terms of earnings growth, the best is behind corporate India. For the market, that is a concern, because the slowdown comes at a time when inflows of liquidity into the market are also drying up. Moreover, price-earnings ratios in the Indian market continue to be relatively high compared to its peers, in spite of the correction in the past month. These higher valuations had been justified on the basis of higher earnings growth and with growth tapering off, it may become difficult to sustain them. Further, although companies are expanding capacity, that will, at least in the initial stages, lead to lower return on capital.

 Nevertheless, it is important to stress that although the pace of earnings growth has slowed, it is still much higher than growth in most parts of the world. Significantly, with bank credit growing at around 30 per cent and with continuing high volume growth in sectors such as automobiles, telecommunications and retailing, consumption demand is still very robust. To be sure, prices have fallen in sectors such as steel, but that is probably more the result of higher Chinese supply than to any tapering off of demand. The turnaround in the fast moving consumer goods sector too is another indication of rising consumer demand. What?s more, this consumption demand is increasingly being supplemented by higher investment demand, best seen from the fatter order books of engineering companies. Companies in this sector have not only posted healthy profit growth but have also been able to increase their profit margins in spite of higher input costs. Export growth too has been buoyant, seen not only from the results of auto ancillary companies but also from the rising exports of two-wheelers. The rupee depreciation has benefited the IT services companies, and their results reflect the continuing strength of the outsourcing model.

 Simply put, the days of margin expansion delivering higher earnings growth are coming to an end, although much depends on what happens to oil and commodity prices. But from now on, corporate growth will increasingly be dependent on higher volumes and capacity expansion.

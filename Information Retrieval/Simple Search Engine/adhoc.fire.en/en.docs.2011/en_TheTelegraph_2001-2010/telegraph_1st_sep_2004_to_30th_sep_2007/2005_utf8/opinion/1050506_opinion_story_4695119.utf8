 BACK FROM THE DEAD

 Neha Sahay

 The entire country seems to have demonstrated against the Japanese attempt to rewrite history in their textbooks, by whitewashing the Rape of Nanjing in 1937 by their occupation troops, who systematically massacred 300,000 unarmed Chinese. Ironically, when students of Nanjing University wanted to march in protest against Japan last week, their professors told them not to.

 ?We can never forget,? said a 21-year-old student for whom the horror is part of history. To make sure that his generation, and future ones never forget, the government has set up the Memorial of the Nanjing Massacre. Unlike other historical sites, entry here is free. Imaginatively designed to depict a desolate wasteland, with white cobblestones symbolizing corpses; huge stone reliefs depicting scenes of the massacre; photographs taken by Japanese soldiers of executions, of raped women crying in agony or being further humiliated by being made to strip; and even a life-like recreation of the construction site where the remains of thousands of bodies were excavated in 1998-99 ? the memorial leaves visitors shaken. Memorial tablets listing the massacre sites and the number of bodies found in each exhort visitors never to forget, and advise the Chinese to learn from history and revitalize China to prevent any such incident recurring. If only a similar memorial existed to the Jallianwala Bagh victims!

 Golden city

 Like Beijing, Nanjing is an old city whose recorded history goes back to 453 BC. It was twice China?s capital, from the 14th to the 17th century and again during Chiang Kai Shek?s reign, till Mao?s army liberated it in 1949. A monument commemorating the Red Army?s crossing of the Yangtze River on April 23, 1949 and the liberation of Nanjing from the Kuomintang, stands tall in the center of the city. Statues of Mao in various poses are available in the old city, and his slogan, exhorting students to unite, is inscribed on the gate of Nanjing University.

 But unlike Beijing and Shanghai, Nanjing?s old quarter, called Fuzimiao, has been allowed to retain its distinct character. A centre of Confucian studies for the last 1,500 years, Fuzimiao?s main attraction is the Qinhui River. On both sides of its banks are traditional Chinese buildings, the most important being the Confucius Temple, which has the tallest statue of Confucius in China, erected just 20 years ago. Nearby are the imperial examination halls, where aspiring bureaucrats sat in separate cubicles to write their exams, though even this did not prevent cheating, according to the inscriptions there.

 It was not even 100 years ago that the imperial exams were abolished to make way for a public school system. Yet, the contrast between the turn-of-the-century elites and their descendants today couldn?t be greater ? the former characterized by their pigtails and their long silk gowns, the latter in jeans and streaked hair.

 Fuzimiao abounds in contrasts: just 20 feet from the Confucius Temple are KFC, McDonald?s and an old-style theatre. Young girls in the shortest of black hot pants, bikini tops and boots strut around its entrance, inviting viewers inside, while an open police jeep makes its rounds. In contrast, the new Nanjing city seems deserted even in this ?Golden May Day Holiday Week?.

 Unlike in China?s old cities, skyscrapers are not yet the norm in Nanjing. Those just outside the 102-year-old University spoil the beauty of its old ivy-covered buildings, grumble students. Another surprise is that many of Nanjing?s famed tree-lined boulevards have survived modern China?s road-widening and construction boom. It?s an unbelievable sight: huge old trees on either side of the road meet to keep the sun?s harsh glare out, and under their cool shade, traffic moves chock-a-block. If only India?s urban planners could learn this lesson from China!

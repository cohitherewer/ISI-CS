 NOT FARING WELL

 The right way is often the most difficult way. The chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, Mr Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, is caught in a cleft he cannot ignore without losing all credibility. His government had appointed the commission for farmers? welfare to look into the causes of farmers? suicides in the state. But to table its report in the assembly and follow its recommendations would also mean taking policy decisions regarding liberalization and economic reform. The report leaves Mr Reddy with no alternative, since it identifies as the root cause of agricultural crisis ?the economic strategy of the past decade at both Central and state government levels?. The complicated interweaving of circumstances that has rendered the farmers of Andhra Pradesh the most vulnerable to post-liberalization pressures on the rural economy includes the aggressiveness with which Mr N. Chandrababu Naidu pursued the ?dream? of globalization. The farmers, and other impoverished rural populations, gave their answer to that in their vote. Mr Reddy?s response to them, after assuming power, was a political necessity, and the prime minister himself announced relief packages and promised development schemes.

 But Mr Reddy is already in trouble with the World Bank. It has refused to release the funds Mr Reddy asked for as part of a Rs 25,000 crore structural adjustment loan agreed upon during the TDP regime. This was the outcome of Mr Reddy?s promise of free power to farmers, and his government?s failure to collect user charges on canal water for irrigation and for the use of government hospital facilities. User charges had been another addition to the burden of debt and despair that was driving farmers to suicide. To go beyond the short-term relief the present government has arranged for would mean major adjustments in the government?s role. The weakening of local governing bodies that could help contain the distress, the push towards water-intensive cultivation with no regulation of groundwater use, debts incurred repeatedly for highly priced inputs, the volatility of markets, especially for non-grain crops that farmers are being pushed into growing, have all combined with successive droughts to increase farmers? suicides over the last seven years. Saving farmers? lives would mean correction in all these spheres. Mr Reddy is not looking forward to stepping on the tightrope.

 CREATURES OF THE DARK

 The Invisibles By Zia Jaffrey, Vintage, $ 11.75

 Hijras form a subculture of casteless castrati transvestites who go back a long way in history. They arrive at every doorstep whenever there is a birth or a marriage and sing and dance until they are paid to leave the family in peace. They populate every city of India. Despite being outcasts, they move freely among the higher castes. Society is aware of them, yet they live a shadowy existence. This is because they are extremely secretive about themselves and also because society wishes to know little about them. Zia Jaffrey tries to unveil the reality of these people.

 In the early Eighties, when Jaffrey came to India, she encountered hijras at a wedding. She was intrigued by their buffoonery and the vague information people had about them. She decided to make them the subject of her research. The result is this book. 

 Researching on the subject was never easy. Several of her relatives did not approve. An aunt advised her: ?Some things are better kept quiet, na. Why don?t you study something more useful, like our urban development planning...Or the gypsies, they?re very interesting...But why this eunuch thing, it?s a dirty business...If you are going to write about India, why don?t you choose a subject that shows our good side? Not the eunuchs. Nobody wants to know.? Two decades after Jaffery started her investigation, the outlook has not changed much. Jaffrey met sometimes with advise, sometimes with threat; once she was thrown out of a party in Hyderabad for asking the host whether he knew anything about the hijras. But these did not deter her. In a way perhaps it made her more determined. Besides, there were a few people, including some hijras, who helped her all along.

 The book takes the reader from the pages of history into the narrow lanes of contemporary India, and in the process tells stories which were never considered fit to be told. Mixing oral history and scholarship, Jaffrey reveals the origins, protocol, rituals and customs of the eunuch community. She traces their ties to the royal courts and the caste system. It is not a pretty story: some of the hijras have been kidnapped into the community, or handed over by families when they are too young to choose for themselves, and some forcefully castrated. Jaffrey makes a conscious effort to understand the hijras on their own terms. Although she is incredulous at times about the illegal practice of castration ceremony and homosexual prostitution, she is never judgmental. And this approach helps her to create a balanced portrait without being unduly sympathetic. There are no straightforward answers in the book. And this elusiveness, and Jaffrey?s calm and sensitive approach, is what makes The Invisibles a treasure.

 SOME LIKE SCORING OWN GOALS

 SHOT IN THE DARK

 The humiliating loss to Pakistan is not likely to wake up the AIFF from its slumber

 Indian football was once again humiliated on Pakistani soil. By now, we have become quite used to losing to our neighbour in cricket and hockey. In soccer, however, we were spared the humiliation. But only till recently. 

 Of course, there was a time when the national side was considered among the best in Asia, and players like Chuni Goswami and T. Balaram the very finest in the continent. Sadly, contemporary Indian football is not even a shadow of its past. Take the case of Japan, whom we have beaten quite a few times in the past. Japan has shot to the top rung in the FIFA rankings. And that?s no fluke ? they almost beat Brazil in the Confederations Cup. India, on the other hand, is 135th among 200-odd soccer-playing nations. Ironically, the domestic circuit here is heavily dependent on foreign recruits of low calibre such as Babalade and Paolo.

 Not that dismal performances ever wake up the All India Football Federation from its slumber. Priya Ranjan Das Munshi and his men have their rhetoric in place, but they have failed to deliver so far. For the AIFF, building a new head office is more important than carrying out a sincere analysis of, say, the tour to Pakistan. They perhaps feel that their job ends with appointing a national coach or arranging for the prime minister to inaugurate the National Football League. But it is also their job to ensure that the players receive a few basic amenities both on and off the field ? such as proper dressing rooms and modern heath facilities. 

 The AIFF has also done precious little to promote this game. The NFL, kicked off a few years ago, is yet to attract crowds to the stadium. As a result, its popularity remains confined to a few states like Bengal and Goa. The response to the Junior NFL, started this year, has been extremely poor. This shows that youngsters are not keen to take up soccer.

 ?If you leave aside the Team India stars,? asserts S. Ramamurthy, UB?s anchor for United East Bengal Team Private Limited, ?an average footballer playing for a National League side earns more than the average first-class cricketer.? But the AIFF has failed to ?provide the right support system and technical inputs, getting in corporate sponsors and live television, imparting a sense of security among those earning their bread from football?. A lesson from the BCCI may help.

 Meanwhile, the clubs are trying their best to raise the ?professionalism bar?. East Bengal, for instance, has recently tied up with Pony International of California. From an overseas pre-season trainer to air-conditioned changing rooms, gym and jacuzzi, the support infrastructure is in place. In most countries, the national body leads by example. Here, we will be grateful if the AIFF follows the example set by the clubs.

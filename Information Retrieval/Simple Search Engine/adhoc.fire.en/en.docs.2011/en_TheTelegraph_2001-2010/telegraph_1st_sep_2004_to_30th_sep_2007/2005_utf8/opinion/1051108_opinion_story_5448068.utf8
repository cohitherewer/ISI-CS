 THE TWO MODERN SCOURGES

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the Human Development Report 2005

 At the start of the 21st century we live in a divided world. The size of the divide poses a fundamental challenge to the global human community. Part of that challenge is ethical and moral. As Nelson Mandela put it in 2005: ?Massive poverty and obscene inequality are such terrible scourges of our times...that they have to rank alongside slavery and apartheid as social evils.? The twin scourges... can be defeated ? but progress has been faltering and uneven.

 Rich countries as well as poor have an interest in changing this picture. Reducing the gulf in wealth and opportunity that divides the human community is not a zero-sum game in which some have to lose so that others gain. Extending opportunities for people in poor countries to lead long and healthy lives, to get their children a decent education and to escape poverty will not diminish the well-being of people in rich countries. On the contrary, it will help build shared prosperity and strengthen our collective security. In our interconnected world a future built on the foundations of mass poverty in the midst of plenty is economically inefficient, politically unsustainable and morally indefensible.

 Life expectancy gaps are among the most fundamental of all inequalities. Today, someone living in Zambia has less chance of reaching age 30 than someone born in England in 1840 ? and the gap is widening. HIV/AIDS is at the heart of the problem. In Europe the greatest demographic shock since the Black Death was suffered by France during the World War I. Life expectancy fell by about 16 years. By comparison, Botswana is facing an HIV/AIDS-inflicted fall in life expectancy of 31 years. Beyond the immediate human costs, HIV/AIDS is destroying the social and economic infrastructure on which recovery depends. The disease is not yet curable. But millions of lives could already have been saved had the international community not waited until a grave threat developed into a fullfledged crisis.

 No indicator captures the divergence in human development opportunity more powerfully than child mortality. Death rates among the world?s children are falling, but the trend is slowing down ? and the gap between rich and poor countries is widening. This is an area in which slowing trends cost lives. Had the progress of the Eighties been sustained since 1990, there would be 1.2 million fewer child deaths this year. Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for a rising share of child deaths; the region represents 20 per cent of births worldwide and 44 per cent of child deaths. But the slowdown in progress extends beyond Sub-Saharan Africa. Some of the most highly visible globalization ?success stories?... are failing to convert rapid decline in child mortality. Deep-rooted human development inequality is at the heart of the problem.

 Debates about trends in global income distribution continue to rage. Less open to debate is the sheer scale of inequality. The world?s richest 500 individuals have a combined income greater than that of the poorest 416 million. Beyond these extremes, the 2.5 billion people living on less than $2 a day? 40 per cent of the world?s population ? account for 5 per cent of the global income. The richest 10 per cent, almost all of whom live in high-income countries, account for 54 per cent.

 An obvious corollary of extreme global inequality is that even modest shifts in distribution from top to bottom could have dramatic effects on poverty. Using a global income distribution database, we estimate a cost of $300 billion for lifting 1 billion people living on less than $1 a day above the extreme poverty line threshold. That amount represents 1.6 per cent of the income of the richest 10 per cent of the world?s population. Of course, this figure describes a static transfer. Achieving sustainable poverty reduction requires dynamic process through which poor countries and poor people can produce their way out of extreme deprivation. But in our highly unequal world, greater equity would provide a powerful catalyst for poverty reduction and progress towards the millennium development goals.

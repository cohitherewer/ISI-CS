 WHAT?S LEFT OF THE LEFT?

 Malvika Singh

 Television brings non-stop bad news, news about a father-in-law raping his son?s wife, news about the CPI(M) stalling every economic move made by the ruling coalition, news about natural disasters and destitution, endless crime-based stories, silly party events, bulletins repeated ad nauseum for at least 48 hours on weekends, when many more are glued to the small screen for a lack of anything to do in this scorching heat drowned in humidity. It is just plain dull. 

 The left may have the best intentions in the world and a comparatively ?honest? leadership, but it has not been able to stretch its mental horizon, to dream a new dream and move with the times, and ?changing times? does not mean endorsing or condoning the continuing neglect of the poor. But, where are the fresh energetic approaches to combat poverty? Why are the slogans stuck in a time warp? Why doesn?t it address and solve the real issues of paani and naukri? Why is its action inept, ineffective? Why are the left leaders static and adamant that only they know it all and only they care? Why is everything a ?demand? and never a dialogue? 

 Why does it continue to behave like rabble-rousing opposition players ? of the Fifties, when it fragmented and split its ranks and its allegiances? Can it not see that the poorest of the poor want dignity, want to move on and share the experience of being in the 21st century? Why is it incapable of hearing and listening? In fact, its positions and its style of operation appear akin to the traits of the BJP and the RSS ? not wanting to hear another view or change an attitude or stance, much like being trapped in a box with a tight, rusty lid that stifles the mind. 

 The jing bang lot

 Many of us have been instinctively left of the many ?horrors? of the extreme right, but to damn all to come from a different ideology is equally regressive and unacceptable. This marking time on the tune and the near-military band of the ageing leaders of the left leaves zero space for new ideas, initiatives and experiments. On the other side is the similar anthem of the right, and neither represents the motley crowd of one billion and more that make up the constituents of India. 

 The liberal element has let this country down as well. It has diluted and bastardized the definition of the word, making it meaningless in our present reality. All political hues are seen squabbling, not listening to one another, indulging in self-aggrandizement, being indecisive, switching sides if lucrative offers come their way. All this despicable behaviour bombards us each day via our television screens. 

 Instead of banning the smoking of cigarettes, there should be a ban on politicians appearing on TV. Their behaviour will set a terrible example to the young generation as will the shenanigans of the administration of this country. All such horrors should not be allowed in the public space because they are hugely polluting. They infect the mind. Cut these people and their selfish games out of our daily lives and living will be far more comfortable, even celebratory. 

 People in India, with minimal infrastructure at their disposal, have produced wealth and generated energy. They have delivered against huge odds, worked hard and been successful despite the corruption that abounds. Those who fled their motherland are socially and professionally respected and trusted in their adopted homeland. Here people are hounded by corrupt practices and a lack of clean, transparent governance. It is impossible to function in India if you are honest and straightforward. Cleansing the system should be the one-point agenda of the left, the right and the centre ? the whole jing bang lot. That done, dilute the role of the administration, government and all political interference, ban it, and watch Indians take over the world.

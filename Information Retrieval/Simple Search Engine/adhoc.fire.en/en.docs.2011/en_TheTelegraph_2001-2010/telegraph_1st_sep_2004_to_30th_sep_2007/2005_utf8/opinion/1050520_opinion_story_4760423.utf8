 VETO ISSUE

 The process of expanding the United Nations security council has finally generated momentum. The latest evidence of this is the new draft resolution moved by India, Germany, Japan and Brazil: the so-called G-4 countries. Although it is unlikely that the draft resolution will invite widespread support, the possibility of a larger UN security council is greater today than at any time since 1945. The draft resolution, which was circulated to nearly 70 countries, seeks to expand the security council from its present strength of 15 to 25 members. This would include six new permanent members and four temporary members. The resolution explicitly states that the new permanent entrants would have the same ?responsibilities and obligations? as the present permanent members. In other words, the new entrants would also have veto powers if the resolution were translated into reality. 

 All the G-4 countries are claimants of permanent membership, while the two other vacant slots would be filled, according to the resolution, by representatives from Africa. According to the strategy developed by the G-4, after a month of lobbying, a framework resolution would be moved in the UN general assembly in June this year. For the resolution to be passed, it would require the support of two-thirds of the membership of the UN. If this happens, an amendment to the UN charter also needs to be made subsequently. The draft resolution, however, has already invited criticism. The United States of America, easily the country with the greatest weight and influence in the UN system, has described the G-4 draft as a ?matter of concern? and clearly indicated that it will not support security-council expansion with veto powers. Even China has suggested that the draft resolution ?will fuel conflict and undermine the security council. The bulk of the membership of the UN general assembly has, for long, believed that the veto power has been misused by the five permanent members for their vested interests, especially during the Cold War era. Under the circumstances, it is unlikely that the majority will support more states with veto powers. 

 There is, however, clearly a silver lining. Support for reforming the UN, especially for the expansion of the security council, is all pervasive. All the permanent members of the security council and a large section of the member states want the UN security council to reflect contemporary international realities. Thus, there could be considerable support for a resolution which will seek expansion without extending veto powers. The G-4 members probably realize this ground reality, but may be using the ?veto issue? as a bargaining chip to finally settle for permanent membership without the right to block action.

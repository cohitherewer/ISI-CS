 All this history

 A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian

 By Marina Lewycka,

 Viking, ? 9.10

 Marina Lewycka?s debut novel could be described as the answer to the question: What happens when an eighty-four-year-old Ukrainian ?migr? in Britain falls for a woman less than half his age who, it is evident, is looking for a way to turn her Ukrainian tourist visa into a British passport? The hilarious tale is told by the ?migr??s daughter, Nadezhda, a sociology teacher and British national with liberal leanings and no memories, other than received ones, of a Ukrainian past. 

 The ?memories? are the preserve of her older sister, Vera, the War Baby, who wields them, according to her convenience, to turn Nadezhda, the Peacetime Baby, into a ?bogey-nosed four-year old? (?You see, the trouble with your generation...is that you?ve just skated the surface of life. Peace. Love. Workers? Control. It?s all idealistic nonsense.?); or to claim victimhood, and the lion?s share of their dead mother?s hard-saved money (?I had to learn to fight for myself...It?s easy to be superior when you don?t know what hardship is?). Nadezhda?s grouse against Vera is not so much about inheritance or world view as it is about the exiled family?s archive of memories, to which she feels she has been unfairly denied entry.

 Just when it seems that the cold war between the two is to become permanent, a common enemy brings them together. The enemy is their father?s 36-year-old bride-to-be ? Valentina, with superior Botticellian breasts, knowledge of Nietzsche and Schopenhauer, admiration for Constructivist art and hatred of neo-classicism. With her comes her genius teenage son who must have nothing less than ?OxfordCambridge? education. And in Ukraine is her intelligent-type polytechnic-director husband, who will obligingly fax her the divorce papers as soon as the new marriage is fixed. But these are of no consequence to Nikolai Mayevskyj, the father, for whom Valentina brings the scent of mown hay and cherry blossom from Ukraine ? so what if Nadezhda can only detect ?the distinct synthetic whiff of new Russia? ? and the promise of companionship and care in his old age.

 Of course, Valentina does not discuss art, literature and philosophy with her new husband in the evenings, and of course, she does not cook for him and take care of him once the marriage is solemnized. Instead, she milks Nikolai dry of his meagre pension and equally sorry savings, to buy, among other things, peach-pink pearlized lipstick and nail polish (?tart make-up?), high-heeled peep-toe mules, expensive underwear (?underwired, ribbon-strapped, lycra-panelled, lace-trimmed green satin rocket launcher?), boil-in-the-bag meals, numerous tins of mackerel (?buy one get one free?), a Lada and a museum-piece Rolls-Royce. Her son, Stanislav, too turns out to be not a genius after all, as his GCSE results (Grade C and D in most subjects, Grade A in religious studies only!) and the porn magazines under his bed reveal. This comes as a minor relief, since it means an end to the ?OxfordCambridge? demand. 

 But the other demands are quite enough to make Nikolai soil his trousers frequently. These include replacement of Crap Car, Crap Cooker, and Crap Hoover. As the daughters? suspicion and resistance to her plans become more evident ? Nadezhda slips cringingly out of her liberal shoes into Mrs Flog-?em-and-send-?em-home stilettos while Vera dons her familiar Mrs Divorce Expert mantle ? Nikolai gets the rough edge of Valentina?s tongue (?useless shrivel-brain shrivel-penis donkey?), and of the wet tea towel, and ends up frequently with bumps on his head. Valentina?s whereabouts get curioser and curioser as divorce and deportation proceedings speed up. The reason, as it turns out, is that she is pregnant. It is only too easy to prove the preposterousness of Nikolai?s paternity. The baby and the divorce order are delivered on the same day. As the family gets ready to celebrate the injunction, arrives Dubov, Valentina?s ?intelligent-type? husband from Ukraine. And the two rivals in love, engineers both, get on like a house on fire. Nikolai has finally found someone who can truly appreciate his ?Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian?, the treatise he has been doggedly composing through all this turbulence. 

 But Dubov is Valentina?s redemption. In spite of the baby of uncertain paternity, and the marriage to Nikolai, Dubov has come to take Valentina back. And so Valentina departs, ?civilized person?s hoover?, electric cooker and all, to an unknown, perhaps happier, future in ?Ukraina?. Nikolai finally agrees to sheltered housing, one of the many tools of the welfare state to help men and women in their old age.

 Not one of these can remedy the pangs of loneliness or the exile?s sense of alienation that the widower Nikolai feels even in the Ukrainian neighbourhood of Peterborough. The craving for even a little feel of ?Ukraina? ? almost a term of endearment when he says it ? makes him stretch the bounds of human generosity, even in the face of Valentina?s schemes and misdemeanours. Yet Valentina is not a villain, but a creature driven to cunning by the desperation to secure a brighter future for her son than she could in Ukraine. The dysfunction of the Mayevskyj family and the sitcom-like unfolding of the episodes make you laugh uncontrollably, but, as a naked Nikolai strikes a yogic aubade posture in the sheltered housing, you realize that the urge to cry is just as strong.

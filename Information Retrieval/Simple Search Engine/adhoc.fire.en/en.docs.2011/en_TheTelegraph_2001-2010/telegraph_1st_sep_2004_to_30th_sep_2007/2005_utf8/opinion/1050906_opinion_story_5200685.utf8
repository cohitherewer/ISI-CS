 FIGHT OR TALK?

 Disasters do not always make people or governments wiser. The Maoist depredations in different parts of the country are nothing short of a national challenge. Yet, every strike by the rebels holds a mirror to the pathetic lack of a national strategy to meet the challenge. The government?s response to the latest Maoist violence in Chhattisgarh was no exception. New Delhi?s promise to make a ?comprehensive review? of the Maoist threat and to decide on ?counter-measures? has a tired ring to it. Neither the rebels nor the people take such statements seriously. The result is that the affected states try to deal with the problem in their own ways. True, the rebel threat varies among the states ? both in intensity and form. The ground realities may, therefore, justify different approaches to the problem by the state government. But all that is no reason for not having a national strategy to fight the menace. It is not simply a question of having a coordination committee of police and intelligence outfits of the affected states. It is also more than a matter of providing the states with funds, weapons and other logistical support. 

 What New Delhi and the states have to decide primarily is whether they fight the rebels or talk to them. It is possible ? and sometimes even necessary ? to do both; but the governments must know when to do what. The peace initiatives in Andhra Pradesh have repeatedly exposed how the Maoists abuse them in order to re-group and re-arm. Insurrectionists anywhere use both war and peace as propaganda. The state can match this only by showing credible results for its strategy. An effective strategy is the one that shows the state in a position of strength. In other words, the rebels must be shown as losers. What the country witnesses instead is a piecemeal approach that advocates the use of force in one state and talks in another. Also, a socio-economic angle is loosely added to official responses to the rebellion, as if poverty and other inequities justify anarchism. Such half-measures do not add up to a strategy.

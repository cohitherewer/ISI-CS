 MIDDLE WAY

 A moment of history may come quite without fanfare. The tussle over the acceptance of a model nikaahnama or marriage contract by the All India Muslim Personal Law Board has been simmering for a while. Its passage was becoming one of those eternally looked-for things. Now that the board has accepted it, the good news is taking time to sink in. The single greatest gain of the model nikaahnama is that the practice of unilateral verbal triple talaq has been outlawed. No divorce can henceforth take place without the mediation of the qazi, who will first try ways of reconciliation. In case of divorce, the qazi will ensure that the bridal price or meher is paid to the wife before divorce as the personal law requires, gifts such as jewellery are split and maintenance settled upon. While it is true that a change in the law, even when it is the personal law, may not have an immediate effect on a heartless social practice that so obviously benefits the man, it is also true that the wife will find it easier to appeal for justice.

 What is perhaps equally important is the actual change of mindset within the board, without which the model nikaahnama could not have been passed. The objections to it have been gradually worn down. The thrust for reform from within the community holds forth the greatest hope for change. One of the biggest hindrances to reform is the political manipulation of the relationship between the minority community on the one hand and the state and the majority community on the other. The only force that can neutralize this is a desire for change within the community. The perpetrators of 9/11 have brought home to India?s minority community the need to declare its place in a rational, liberal, gender-just inheritance. The irony is that many of the social practices in the minority community in India are distortions or misinterpretations of a liberal and fair-minded law. Women are the victims of such distortions in all religions. In that sense, the model nikahnama is a reiteration of older principles.

 It is promising that another debate has also begun among the board members over the age of consent for girls in marriage. In this, the AIMPLB is far from behind the times, since underage marriage ? or the inability of the law or the administration to prevent such marriages ? has become one of the major concerns of the time. The convergence, or at least the possibility of convergence, of the concerns of personal law and civil law may have surprisingly beneficial effects, both socially as well as politically. It may actually provide an unexpected route through the puzzle of the parallel existence of personal law systems of all religions alongside the civil law. India?s secular society will not have matured fully without confronting and working through this fundamental anomaly.

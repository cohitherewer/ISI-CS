 Letters to Editor

 Let us forget them

 Sir ? The letters on the president?s advice to governors made amusing reading (?In all fairness?, June 21). What I fail to understand is, why must we continue to retain the useless trappings of the raj? The best advice that A.P.J. Abdul Kalam can give to the government is the scrapping of the posts of the president and the governor. Nobody takes the incumbents seriously, they require a mind-boggling amount of funds to be maintained and they are in no way capable of ensuring that the citizens get a fair deal. These appointments are nothing but sinecures for the old faithfuls of various hues. As an example, K.R. Narayanan?s ineffectual attempt to check the Gujarat riots of 2002 was one of the most unedifying incidents of post-independence India. We must shed our anachronistic administrative modus vivendi and adopt a different mode of governance.

 Yours faithfully,

 Jayanta Dutt, Calcutta

 Happy ending

 Sir ? The emotionally-charged farewell letters from both Mukesh and Anil Ambani to the staff of the companies they have handed over show that they were genuinely attached to the institutions their father had founded and they had nourished (?Farewell notes before solitary journeys?, June 20). Anil Ambani?s letter, particularly, bears his personal touch. But both brothers have been taught to be responsive to employees and investors. When the Reliance group was in trouble for a while, I, as a share-holder, had written a letter of encouragement to Dhirubhai Ambani. I was pleasantly surprised to find my letter replied personally by Mukesh Ambani, who thanked me for my support. Let us hope that the brothers keep the Reliance flag flying high and desist from competing with each other. Otherwise, Reliance will meet the fate of the DCM group, which, like Reliance, once decided the sensitive index. 

 Yours faithfully,

S.C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir ? Kokilaben Ambani has done the impossible ? amicably settled a property dispute between two feuding brothers. But who will ultimately get to say ?Mere pass Ma hai??

 Yours faithfully,

Mahesh Kumar, New Delhi

 Sir ? It is nice to find the dispute between the Ambani siblings finally resolved. Perhaps it would have been better had the Reliance empire remained intact. But a parting of ways was considered the best possible option, keeping in mind the welfare of the shareholders. It remains to be seen how well the two brothers are now able to manage their individual stakes. One thing however needs to be said. Reliance was never a hugely popular brandname, even after the company sponsored the 1987 ICC world cup. It was Reliance Infocomm that brought the brand to the common man. Reliance will continue to capture the public imagination so long as Reliance telephony serves its consumers well.

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Sir ? Dhirubhai Ambani would have been sad to see his legacy split between the two warring brothers. Kokilaben may have separated the feuding brothers but that does not mean that the division of property was fair. While the elder brother has received the flagship RIL, the younger has the new ventures like Reliance Infocomm and Reliance Capital, which are yet to find their feet. However, there is no doubt that Anil Ambani?s companies are in sunrise industries and have a vast scope for expansion. Although the two brothers will not compete with each other immediately, a different kind of rivalry may crop up ? to show who has Dhirubhai?s entrepreneurial skills. 

 Yours faithfully,

G.D. Dujari, Calcutta

 Sir ? All?s well that ends well. Thanks to Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani, who put an end to the anxiety of millions of shareholders. The past few months have been hellish for the share markets and the main reason has been the dispute between the brothers. The best part of the settlement was that it was amicable. If one turns the pages of history, one will find that such ?joint? families have always broken. Reliance has been a great brand name and investors will hope that the brothers continue with the core values the brand symbolizes. Since there is now truce between the brothers, one can be certain that committees will be formed in the coming few days to tackle the issue of corporate governance and other matters that will benefit the company and, ultimately, the shareholders, the latter having always been the prime objective of the patriarch of the company.

 Yours faithfully,

Sumant Poddar, Calcutta

 Sir ? The impact of the settlement among the Ambanis has been felt throughout the country, especially in the stock markets. Although the most common business practice is merger, which turns conglomerates into mega-conglomerates, the division in the Reliance group was the only viable solution to the eight-month-old rift between the two brothers.

 Yours faithfully,

V. Krishnakumar, New Delhi

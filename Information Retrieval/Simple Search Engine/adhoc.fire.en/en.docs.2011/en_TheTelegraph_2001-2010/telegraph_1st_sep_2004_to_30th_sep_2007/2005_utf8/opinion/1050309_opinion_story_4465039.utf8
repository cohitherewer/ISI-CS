 Letters to Editor

 Repeat story

 Sir ? A few months back, Dhananjoy Chatterjee?s hanging created a lot of brouhaha. Some philanthropists wanted to rehabilitate him, ironically at public expense. Fortunately, better sense prevailed. The news of the hanging created such a flutter possibly because executions in India are not as commonplace as in the United States of America. If their incidence increases, there is enough reason to assume that people will stop getting so flustered. The public response to ?Death for 3 in wall murder? (March 5) bears evidence of that. The newspapers bring so much brutality to the breakfast table every day that one feels, like the Beadon Street neighbours of the killers in the ?wall murder?, there is a social need to increase the number and frequency of executions. Perhaps they will, by the emphasis of their repeated action, have a deterrent effect on our collective psyche.

 Yours faithfully,

Chameli Pal, Calcutta

 Self-delusions 

 Sir ? Delusion rules in Sunanda K. Datta-Ray?s ?Out of service? (Feb 26), where the author argues that wealth creation is given a backseat in the United States of America or the United Kingdom. Perhaps the author has forgotten that the two countries he mentions have the most business-friendly environment in the entire developed world, except possibly Japan. The UK is the country where Richard Branson, Rupert Murdoch, Laxmi Mittal, and so on are venerated. The US is the nation which produced Microsoft, General Motors, IBM, WalMart. The author confuses the idea of good governance with wealth generation. All the problems he mentions ? at the post office, bank or government departments ? are organs of the colossal Leviathan the Indian state has become. Because the British and American governments limit themselves to maintaining law and order and operating basic public services, it is able to focus better and consequently provide acceptable services. 

 In India, the state not only does the above, but also runs hotels, steel mills and airports. No wonder it has failed to perform on all fronts. The so called ?quality? which Datta-Ray talks about, would return to Indian society only when the people are given a free hand in generating wealth. Innovation would follow from this, and not from the hope that the state would perform a miracle.

 Yours faithfully,

A. Mukherjee, Earlsdon, UK

 Sir ? Sunanda K. Datta-Ray?s article reminds me of the time when I tried to transfer my post office savings bank account from Sarsuna post office to Kasthadanga PO by surrendering the unused cheques in the previous PO. The postmaster of Kasthadanga PO asked me to apply for a fresh chequebook to the Alipore head post office. I had to do this and more. 

 After repeated attempts to get a new cheque book had failed, I had to approach first the chief post master general, West Bengal Circle, and then the public grievances cell, New Delhi. Several months later, I was asked by the superintendent of post offices (south Calcutta) to surrender the cheques to the Kasthadanga PO. No number of letters could convince the officials that I had already surrendered the cheques at the Sarsuna PO. The officials didn?t even seem capable of keeping track of the details of the case. I even lodged a complaint on the website of the postal department. But my perseverance is yet to pay off. Is this not a glaring example of the collapse of a public utility? 

 Yours faithfully,

Pijush Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? Corruption has become endemic to Indian society, and Sunanda K. Datta-Ray brings this out most evocatively. It is almost comical to think that India wants to claim for itself an economic superpower status when elementary human decency is routinely ignored and the basic needs of ordinary citizens are wantonly disregarded. Unless a massive cultural change comes about and public practices become more ethical, India?s technological and economic advances will remain skin-deep, without making any tangible difference to the lives of millions of Indians. The fact that the state of affairs described by Datta-Ray should persist after five decades of India?s independence does not leave much room for hope.

 Yours faithfully,

Tarasankar Chaudhuri, New Jersey, US

 Border games

 Sir ? We are told that cricket matches between India and Pakistan ? despite Pakistan?s continuing designs on Jammu and Kashmir ? are meant to enhance ?people-to-people? contact, which will ultimately bring the two countries close together. We are also asked to keep politics away from sports. Why then does Pakistan object to inviting the dalai lama for the Dharamsala match? And why does it refuse to play in Ahmedabad for purely political reasons?

 Yours faithfully,

Udita Agrawal, New Delhi

 Sir ? It is a shame that after the lavish welcome accorded to Indian celebrities and even ordinary spectators in Pakistan last year, the Indian establishment is having cold feet over inviting Pervez Musharraf to watch cricket here.

 Yours faithfully,

Suman Ganguly, Calcutta

 DEATH BY WATER

 To drown in a river and be dashed against rocks sounds like a natural calamity. When almost 150 pilgrims perished in the waters of the Narmada on April 10, the tragedy reminded most people of the tsunami. Yet the enormity of this calamity does not lie so much in the numbers as in the fact that it was caused by human error. And this is what must be looked in the face and acted upon. The pilgrims in the river and assembled or sleeping on the banks were swept into the current because water was released earlier from the Indira Sagar dam in the neighbouring district. The Narmada Hydroelectric Development Corporation first denied that it released the water without intimation. If this is correct, then why was their ?intimation? not conveyed to the pilgrims? Later, the NHDC made a very different claim ? that it did not know about the pilgrims. Why did they not? A river as heavily dammed as the Narmada, and with its banks as heavily peopled, ought to have a proper system of communication along its course. In whichever direction the buck is passed, there has been a failure of communication that has had lethal consequences. This is what must be kept in the public mind, and this is what the NHDC must be confronted with in a court of law. Compensations to the victims? families must also be made on the basis of this fact.

 Both the state government (scarcely visible or audible) and the NHDC are repeatedly invoking ?culprits? and the ?guilty? in the vaguest of terms. Police have also registered a case of ?culpable homicide due to negligence?, but against ?unnamed? persons who are to be identified by the inevitable inquiry. But such a catastrophic failure of communication ought to provoke a more urgent concern for accountability and punishment. The Narmada valley has been the hub of energetic and indomitable activism. But, in this case, neither the state nor the non-governmental sector seems enthused enough to even start thinking about justice.

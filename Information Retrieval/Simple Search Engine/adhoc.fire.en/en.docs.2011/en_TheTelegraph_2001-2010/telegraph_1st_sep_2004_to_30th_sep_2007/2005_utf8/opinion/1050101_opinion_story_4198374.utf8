 Out and About

Like charity, discipline begins at home for Meera 

Syal, it seems. The Anita and Me author was looking for an actor to play the younger 

version of her character in the television series to be adapted from her second 

book, Life Isn?t All Ha, Ha, Hee, Hee. When her daughter Chameli, (or Milli, as 

she prefers to be called) auditioned for the role, Syal reportedly said, ?We?ll 

get back to you,? and went on to screen-test other actors. Milli got the part, 

but not before mum made her realise life wasn?t just a laugh. But she did get 

it, didn?t she?Sonali Kulkarni

There?s Mallika Sherawat, who makes oh-so-big a noise 

about her almost-silent roles in Chinese movies. And there?s Sonali Kulkarni, 

the actress who bags the lead role in an Italian film, and stays quiet about it. 

Kulkarni, better known for her commercial roles in films like Dil Chahta Hai and 

Bride amp; Prejudice, is back from acting in a film with Omar Sharif, no less. 

Fire At My Heart, directed by Lamberto Lambertini, has Kulkarni playing Graziella, 

an Italian fisherman?s daughter and the love interest of Sharif?s grandson, who 

considerably influences the grandpa as well. Kulkarni says she learnt Italian 

for the role, to get the part right. That?s dedication for you.

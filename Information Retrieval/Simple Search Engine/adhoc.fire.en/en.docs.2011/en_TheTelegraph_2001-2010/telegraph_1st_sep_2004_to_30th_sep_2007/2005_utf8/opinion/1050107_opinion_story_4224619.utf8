 Paperback Pickings

 Backward, poor, but full of mysteries

Out of Iindia (John Murray, Rs 200) 

by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala has been written, one assumes, because ?To live 

in India and be at peace, one must to a very considerable extent become Indian, 

and adopt Indian attitudes, habits, beliefs...? The fifteen stories in the book 

are born out of Jhabvala?s latest interest ? not India, but herself in India. 

She has few kind words to offer about the country, having decided that it is impossible 

to love India in its entirety. ?The most salient fact about India?, she writes 

in her introduction, ?is that it is very poor and very backward.? There is a wonderful 

passage in the introduction summing up her long association with the country. 

Quoting the passage is impossible to resist: ?I have a nice house, I do my best 

to live in an agreeable way. I shut all my windows, I let down the blinds, I turn 

on the air-conditioner, I read a lot of books...All the time, I know myself to 

be on the back of this great animal of poverty and backwardness. It is not possible 

to pretend otherwise. Or rather, one does pretend, but retribution follows. Even 

if one never rolls up the blinds and never turns off the air-conditioner, something 

is bound to go wrong. People are not meant to shut themselves up in rooms and 

pretend there is nothing outside.?

The Unicorn Expedition and other stories (Puffin, Rs 250) by Satyajit Ray takes Professor Trilokeshwar Shonku from Cairo to Gopalpur to the Bolivian city of Cochabamba, trailing mysteries that get curioser and curioser. Have we got any other character in Indian fiction who can make a mofussil town seem perfectly credible as the site of pathbreaking inventions and spine-chilling adventures?

Christian Conversions (Ebong Alap, Rs 50) 

by Sumit Sarkar, Tanika Sarkar and Pradip Datta begins with a collage of 

newspaper clippings of attacks on Indian Christians by Hindu groups or mobs. What 

seemed at first to be sporadic attacks on converted tribals soon emerged as ?an 

orchestrated campaign by different Hindutva organizations to make religious 

intolerance part of social life.? The approach of the book is interactive, dealing 

with the issues of conversion, re-conversion and the violence surrounding them 

through questions and answers. The easy-flowing text, interspersed with cases 

and incidents, and the accompanying graphics and illustrations make the book suitable 

for the lay reader.

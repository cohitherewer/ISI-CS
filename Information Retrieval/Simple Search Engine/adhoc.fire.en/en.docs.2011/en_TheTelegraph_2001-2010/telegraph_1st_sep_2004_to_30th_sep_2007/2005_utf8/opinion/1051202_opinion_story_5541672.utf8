 STATE OF REAL GROWTH

 Malvika Singh

 When the prime minister says he wants to generate at least 10 per cent growth in India, we all not only wish it but long for it. However, what urgently needs doing is a radical correction of colonial laws that rule us in this new and highly technological millennium. Our bureaucrats and political leadership have operated under the cover of such ?draconian? laws and the police have allowed petty criminals to settle personal scores by the misuse of certain police acts that allow for FIRs and in some cases, custody, till proven not guilty. Corruption is rampant in this sphere. Manmohan Singh needs to initiate the rewriting of these codes that have compelled India to wallow in inappropriate state intervention and harassment at all levels, particularly where citizens fight for their rights and against the wrong practices of the state.

 Progress cannot happen if private endeavour is beset with corrupt, conniving and insecure officialdom. Colonial laws, constant state interference and unreasonable bureaucratic demands are together a breeding ground for the killer disease of corruption. The majority of the people want to live a clean, uncluttered, honest life. When the overpowering machinery of government suffocates those basic human desires, a nation can only regress into anarchy even if the statistics show ?growth?. Economists at the helm of India must begin to link the social reality with the ?growth? they hope to ensure. Across the globe it is taken that civil society must go hand in hand with any economic ?boom?.

 Flight to freedom

 The other aspect of society that should run in parallel with this ?growth? is cultural renewal. Unfortunately, the larger area of culture, conservation, creativity, philosophy, values, all aspects special to India, are hugely neglected because they are just not understood by most of those who rule us. It is all economics and politics with no concern for what makes this country really tick. As aliens to our multi-layered culture, most politicos and bureaucrats, the policy-makers, have relegated this critical realm to the backburner. Pride in ourselves has been diluted as we ape the average attributes of anchorless cultures. Aspirations appear to stem from greed, not knowledge. We are fast making a mockery of ourselves.

 The time has come to talk of real issues and not shove them under the carpet. Decisions, not instituting endless hollow commissions, need to be taken. We have managed to destroy a legacy of salutary laws that were put in place to defend a dwindling forest cover and stop the killing of wild animals. An intellectually-corrupt and self-serving administration reduced the law that governs this realm into a joke. We have, over recent months, succeeded in making the tiger extinct. A task force of non-experts was the front as the tigers continued to be massacred. The truth and reality stand exposed.

 Our rivers continue to be poisoned with industrial effluents, inept municipalities are responsible for the pollution and decay of the urban environment and no leader does anything to radically overhaul the disgusting state of affairs, we take the many easy and short-term options to tide over whatever crises happen, and Bharat is forced to mark time.

 Even the minds of those who govern our lives have been polluted. Their self-interests are a hindrance as a whole new generation, in their early twenties and thirties are raring to go, on the threshold of a breakthrough. These young brains must be released from the dreadful iron cage my generation was locked in. They must be encouraged to take flight and reach new heights. They must be freed from the babu and his stranglehold, liberated from the suffocation of redundant rules, many of which belong to the past. That is how ludicrous and cumbersome civilian life is for innocent, unsuspecting, honest Indians.

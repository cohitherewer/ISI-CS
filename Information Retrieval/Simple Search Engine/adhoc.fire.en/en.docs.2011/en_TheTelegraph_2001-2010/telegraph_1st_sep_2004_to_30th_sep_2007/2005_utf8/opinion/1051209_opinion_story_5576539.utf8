 Look back in laughter 

 Perfection in miniature is one way to view R.K. Laxman?s 

 cartoons, which offer the richest delight through their 

 many-layered appeal. The completely assured strokes ? the 

 angle of a tiny eyebrow, the bewildered slackness of a mouth, 

 an amazed twist to the neck ? convey, within a tiny square 

 of often crowded space, drama, irony, derision, hilarious 

 contrast and, always, deep aesthetic pleasure. The gentle 

 but observant Common Man is the most enduring figure in 

 this retrospective volume, BRUSHING UP THE YEARS: A CARTOONIST?S 

 HISTORY OF INDIA 1947-2004 (Penguin, Rs 750), but 

 as unforgettable are the familiar figures of India?s leaders, 

 caught for ever in ludicrous situations of exposure. The 

 relentless political commentary behind the fun is as keen 

 and unerring as the witty hand that wields the brush.

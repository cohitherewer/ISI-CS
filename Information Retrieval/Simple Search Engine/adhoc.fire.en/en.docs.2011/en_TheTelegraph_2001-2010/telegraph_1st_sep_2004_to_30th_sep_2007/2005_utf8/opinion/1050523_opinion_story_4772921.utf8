 FOREIGN TO POLICY-MAKING

 TWENTY-TWENTY 

BHARAT BHUSHAN

 Malleability and manipulation

 An unclear foreign policy has been the hallmark of the first year of the United Progressive Alliance government. The momentum of past policies has however allowed a public perception of success or partial success to gain ground.

 There have been some glaring errors of judgment both with regard to what India expects and what it is willing to give in its neighbourhood and in relating with the big powers.

 In dealing with the royal coup against democracy in Nepal, Indian foreign policy has been oscillating from one end to the other. If the case for promoting democracy in Nepal was untenable ? after all, pragmatists could argue that such standards were not set for dealing with Pakistan, Bangladesh or even Bhutan ? then it should not have been made. But since it was made then India should have persisted with it. 

 Lacking the courage to do so, Natwar Singh and Manmohan Singh during their sojourn to Indonesia jointly managed to convey that India is malleable and open to manipulation. What is amazing is the great satisfaction India seems to draw from co-ordinating its policy with the United States of America and United Kingdom even though this has given them a foothold in India?s backyard.

 India has no policy of dealing with an unfriendly government in Bangladesh. Dhaka shelters Indian militants, has picked up Indian Border Security Force officials, beaten them and even killed them, and New Delhi has only made conciliatory noises. It is afraid of focusing on contentious issues with Dhaka for fear of triggering an upsurge of anti-India feelings but by neglecting the problems, they become more acute.

 In the case of Pakistan, it is General Pervez Musharraf and international opinion that have been driving the relationship. The so-called ?soft border? approach if not handled properly can end up creating a unified political space for separatist platforms like Hurriyat across the entire state of Jammu and Kashmir. If that becomes the sole political platform and is projected internationally as such, then it might become next to impossible for India to get a Kashmir solution on its own terms. 

 By constantly repeating that the peace process will be made irreversible, India has also given up the issue of cross-border terrorism. This suits Pakistan ? the infrastructure of terror can continue to be in place, triggered for use whenever necessary, but India will continue with the peace process. It also suits the US ? a relatively calmer atmosphere allows it to sell F-16s and other military equipment to Pakistan. 

 The UPA?s lack of caution in dealing with the US is even more worrying. It is an unequal relationship where Washington has more diplomatic cards than India. No matter what George W. Bush says, his policies are not compatible with India?s interests. Whether it is the containment of China, the weakening of Russia or beefing up Musharraf militarily, India?s interests do not lie in becoming an accomplice of the US. Bush?s treatment of terrorism as a global issue emanating from Islam is also not compatible with our interests given the composition of our population and our relationship with the Muslim world.

 In fact, one can argue that Washington has given India nothing except tantalizing words such as ?strategic partnership? and ?next steps in strategic partnership?. Meanwhile, the state department continues to be rigid in relation to key Indian areas of interest ? nuclear energy and dual-use technologies. Only the na?ve would expect that cooperation in nuclear technology will move beyond words. The important question to ask is: When it comes to congressional waivers, will Bush be willing to expend the requisite political energy on Capitol Hill to sell nuclear plants to India?

 Under the UPA government?s obsequious policies, matters have slipped so much that acting openly as part of a US lobby does not attract any criticism. Such has been the penetration of the US amongst the Indian intelligentsia, that more articles were published in US newspapers against F-16 sales to Pakistan, and resumption of arms supply without limit, than in India. 

 It is pathetic to see our strategic thinkers arguing that the US will help India become a great power. The strength to achieve that status has to come from the efficiency of India?s internal economic and political processes. Excessive focus on the US and talk about great power status may take its toll on our relations with Russia. India has yet to demonstrate that it has the integrity and resilience to strengthen this relationship. There is also no Europe policy and India?s only trustworthy and all-weather friend in Europe, France, is ignored to please the Americans.

 In dealing with China, there has been reasonable success, but along the path already set by the Vajpayee government. The inherent competition for regional influence will always underpin the realities of this relationship, as would China?s continued support ? nuclear, missile and arms ? to Pakistan. With Japan, India is beginning a new kind of relationship. However, trade with Japan will have to go up substantially if the attempt is to balance China in Asia.

 Nothing is more miserable than the spectacle of India begging every visiting foreign dignitary to support India?s candidature for the UN security council with veto power. Having committed itself to seeking membership only with veto power and finding that the US and China will oppose it, now a process of de-escalating the demand has begun in the guise of seeking wider transformation in the UN. It might have been simpler to seek permanent membership, get it and then fight for veto power from within.

 The overall impression one gets is of confusion and not of clarity of objectives and approaches. The primary reason for this seems to be the lack of coordination and of an integrated foreign policy vision within the government. Being primarily an economist, the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, suffers from a handicap vis-?-vis Natwar Singh in matters relating to foreign policy. That the two do not see eye to eye on many issues has been injurious to the country?s interest. 

 Manmohan Singh?s first choice as national security advisor, J.N. Dixit, had remarkable clarity of vision on international relations. Although he had begun running into trouble with the foreign office and the home ministry for his tendency to centralize power, he could not be faulted for lack of vision. His successor, M.K. Narayanan, is essentially an internal security expert. His coherent vision of the international scene and India?s role in it is as yet not public knowledge. 

 Narayanan is supposed to be a good listener and an eager learner even at the age of 70. But the fact remains that the prime minister does not have an experienced foreign policy advisor in his office. The ministry of external affairs also has no independent policy thinker to advise it or hold a mirror up to it. There was a tradition of having an outside expert as head of policy planning in the external affairs ministry. The late G. Parthasarathy did the job with great aplomb. 

 The prime minister has set up many task forces and advisory bodies. He will be doing the nation a service if he were to set up a foreign policy advisory council, or even appoint a foreign policy advisor.

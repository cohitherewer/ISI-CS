 Letters to Editor

 Thank the enemy

 Sir ? There is no reason to frown at Pakistan for refusing to play a test in Ahmedabad during their visit to India next month. The Pakistani cricketers and board should, in fact, be congratulated for being magnanimous enough to agree to play a one-dayer in the city which saw a pogrom against Muslims just a couple of years ago (?Calcutta wins in Test shift?, Feb 18). Those who criticized Pakistan?s decision not to play a test in Modi-land were full of support for English cricketers when they contemplated cancelling their tour of Mugabe?s Zimbabwe last year. Nor did they have anything to say when India mulled over cancelling its tour of Bangladesh last December on security grounds. What if a predominantly Muslim squad from the ?enemy country? feels its security threatened in Gujarat? Will Modi please remember to thank the Pakistanis when they arrive to play the ODI in Ahmedabad?

 Yours faithfully,

Sagar Hussain, Calcutta

 Far from right

 Sir ? The hypocrisy of the Left Front is as clear as daylight to those of us who live outside India, yet it baffles me to find that the people of West Bengal still do not seem to have seen through the great Indian communist hoax (?Left with no answers?, Feb 17). The policy of our leftists is simple ? oppose any move towards liberalization or economic reformation in Delhi, but adopt precisely the same measures in Calcutta. The important point to note here is that the leftists realize only too well that economic reforms are inevitable: to gain urban votes, they will have to carry out the very policies they oppose at the Centre. 

 Many will remember that only a few months ago, the BBC branded West Bengal ?an industrial wasteland?. This perception is not entirely misplaced. Enterprise here is strangled due to excessive regulation, which in turn stifles growth and increases poverty. As a result, revenues dry up and so do the government coffers. This leads to diminishing investment into the public sector, which breeds more poverty, corruption and crime. Corruption, in any case, prevents the meagre government resources from being fully utilized. It also inspires, and sometimes compels, venture capitalists to adopt underhand means. 

 Under Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, West Bengal is just beginning to climb out of this hole. But if the politburo continues to throw a spanner in the works, then all hope is lost. But the people of Bengal must not let the left get away with its two-faced ways. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Even a leading communist state like China has radically changed its policy and signed the World Trade Organization agreement, which is virtually a capitalist idea. In today?s globalized world, it is impossible to progress if we do not accept the theory of multinationalism. Distribution of agricultural land in small plots, as has been done in West Bengal, has hampered large scientific farming. Similarly, a militant labour union culture, driving away multinational companies and scorning English education have all come together to destroy the job market in the state as well as the economy. The Communist Party of India (Marxist)?s highest authority, the politburo should be ashamed of castigating right-wing parties for wooing voters on communal lines, when the communists practice their own kind of vote-bank politics. 

 It is good to see, however, that the CPI(M) is trying to steer itself towards the right direction. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Wedding royal

 Sir ? Why is there such hullabaloo over Prince Charles?s marriage to his long-time mistress, Camilla Parker-Bowles? Their relationship, even when both had marital commitments, was well known, providing fodder for the British tabloid industry for a long time. The marriage was always a possibility once Diana, Charles?s estranged wife, died, and Parker-Bowles got a divorce. The real question was whether Charles would be ruled out for future kingship. Marriage was a condition for keeping himself in the fray. 

 By deciding to marry Parker-Bowles, Charles has exposed how much he covets the crown, also corroborating Diana?s complaint that he had been unfaithful to her. But then, infidelity is hardly new to the British monarchy. Many British kings had mistresses, and also children out of wedlock. But for ordinary Britishers, the publicity given to the marriage is useless since it is not going to change their quality of life.

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Das Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? Whatever may be the views of the moralists and the royalists about the marriage of Prince Charles with Camilla Parker-Bowles, I think it is one of the rare instances of true love ? waiting for over three decades to wed the person of one?s choice. 

 The other love story that can compare with this is Edward VIII?s abdication of the British throne in 1936 for marrying Wallis Simpson, an American divorcee and a commoner. I would like to recall Edward VIII?s answer to a reporter?s question on whether he regretted his decision. Edward replied: ?If the clock is turned back, I will do it all over again.? 

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? Queen Elizabeth is happy that her son is marrying his old flame. But she sang a different tune in 1955, when her late sister, Princess Margaret, wanted to marry her divorced lover. On the advice of the Church of England, the Queen made it clear that Margaret would lose her royal status if she went ahead with her wedding plans. It is not without reason, therefore, that the next royal wedding is being viewed with a measure of detachment and nonchalance. 

 Yours faithfully, 

J. Akshobhya, Bangalore

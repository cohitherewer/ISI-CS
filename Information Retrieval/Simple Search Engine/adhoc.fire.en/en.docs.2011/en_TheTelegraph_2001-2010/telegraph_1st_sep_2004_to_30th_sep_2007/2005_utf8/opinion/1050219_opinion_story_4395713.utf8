 NO EVENINGS IN PARIS

 It is difficult to imagine Ms Sharmila Tagore as a puritan ? An Evening in Paris or, in a very different way, Days and Nights in the Forest, comes in the way. This is why when Ms Tagore became chairperson of the censor board, most sensible adults in India sighed with relief. But detoxification could become a double-edged weapon in the hands of the confused. And if Ms Tagore wants to be more than just a figurehead, she will have to do some clear and grown-up thinking, and persuade her co-censors to do the same. Leaving aside, for the moment, the usual democratic arguments against censorship, it is surely not difficult to notice the bizarre contradictions in forcing television channels to ?self-regulate? their content with regard to sex and violence, and do so by invoking ?democracy? of all things. This is not a bigoted government but a ?liberal? one that believes in freedom of expression. So these channels are not being subjected to censorship, and are only being made to censor themselves. 

 The police, the information and broadcasting ministry and the censor board have therefore got together to promote liberal values by encouraging ?self-regulation? among the private channels, helped along by the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act. A recent workshop in the capital, attended by Ms Tagore and the I amp;B minister, even thought of a ?quasi-judicial? body of venerables from various disciplines that would oversee this process of self-regulation.

 This is absurd and hypocritical. The good thing about the previous government, and about people like Ms Sushma Swaraj and Mr Murli Manohar Joshi, was that their puritanism was unabashed. It could be recognized from miles away, and did not feel the need to call itself by any other name. It was pure bigotry. But this government?s liberal confusion of values ? practising censorship and calling it self-regulation ? is perhaps a sorrier way to be. It stunts the maturing of democracy quite as harmfully, and panders to Indian society?s worst pathologies and double standards. To complain to the police in order to make sure that the whole family might sit together and watch television ? as many seem to have done in Mumbai ? is to reduce civil society to a classroom of monitors and tattletales. 

 There are saner ways of dealing with choice: adults can switch channels, and regulate their children?s television-watching. This is not to say that the vulgar and the obscene are entirely inapplicable categories when it comes to private judgments. But private judgment is precisely what is at stake here ? the ability to form one?s own judgments, act on them, and help young people form their own. To leave the definition and regulation of these categories to the state, the police and the censor board (whoever its chairperson) is to compromise not only a basic principle of democracy but also the most rudimentary notions of adult responsibility, discrimination and choice.

 Letters to Editor

 Getting even, differently

 Sir ? When Bal Thackeray famously met Javed Miandad amidst much clicking of the shutters, many were overjoyed. But there were some who still persisted in thinking that all this was too good to be true. Thackeray?s loyal cadre has taken it upon itself to prove that their doubts were not misplaced (?Pak test pitch attacked?, Feb 11). Would Thackeray have been so hospitable and charming if his visitor had not been a ?former? Pakistani cricketer but a current member of the team? But wouldn?t the Mumbai tiger (no, we are not talking of Sachin Tendulkar here) love to switch on his telly and watch the Indian boys beating the Pakistanis on Indian soil? What he should have done is to call the Indian team over for dinner to his fortress of a residence and exhort them to do so. That would have ensured a fitting reply to Pakistan?s hospitality, and an even more fitting reply to their cricket.

 Yours faithfully,

Sukumar Sinha, Calcutta

 Errors of commission

 Sir ? Clearly the G.T. Nanavati Commission does not think that the Congress is to blame for the 1984 anti-Sikh riots (?Sikh riots report in, Feb 10). This proves beyond doubt that truth continues to remain hostage to politics. The same judge is also probing the Gujarat riots under the same Commissions of Inquiry Act. And yet, the railways minister, Laloo Prasad Yadav, appointed the U.C. Banerjee Commission separately to investigate the burning of the Sabarmati Express. Why would he do that if he thought that the Nanavati Commission was impartial? 

 If, as Nanavati has pointed out, the prime minister during the 1984 riots, Rajiv Gandhi, cannot be held responsible for each and every action in a police station or a particular district, then, by the same logic, Narendra Modi too cannot be held responsible for what happened in Gujarat in 2002. The Congress leader and lawyer, R.K. Anand, said that the party ?has apologized to the Sikhs... The Bharatiya Janata Party is bringing it up again for political gains but they will not succeed.?? Then why are the Congress, its allies and the left parties harping on the Gujarat riots if not for political gain?

 Yours faithfully,

Premendra Agrawal, Raipur

 Sir ? The details of the Godhra case, as revealed by U.C. Banerjee, were publicized. But even after G.T. Nanavati submitted his report on the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, details about its contents are not forthcoming. It is clear that the Congress is not going to make it public unless it can ensure that its leaders will be protected. But the silence of the media and the leftist leaders is really interesting.

 Yours faithfully,

Sagarika Ghose, Siliguri

 Sir ? The Nanavati Commission is the third commission and the tenth committee to be constituted in the last two decades to probe political complicity in the 1984 anti-sikh riots. But none of these committees and commissions have been able to deliver justice yet. The 200-page report of the Nanavati Commission can at most be a relief, not only for those who lost their relatives in the riots, but also for those who thought that there were two sets of laws, one for the Hindus and another for the minorities. Just four years after Indira Gandhi?s assassination, her murderers were sent to the gallows. Two decades on, the murderers of thousands of Sikhs remain unpunished. 

 After much procrastination on the part of the successive governments, the Nanavati Commission was constituted on May 8, 2000, following the complaint from the Sikh community that the earlier Ranganath Commission had failed to unravel the entire truth behind the riots. Now, if the clouds over the Liberhan Commission investigating the Babri Masjid demolition and the Nanavati Commission?s investigations into Gujarat are cleared, the faith of the minorities can be restored.

 Yours faithfully,

Safiuddin Khan, Aligarh

 Sir ? It is understandable that the Congress will try to save its own skin vis-?-vis the report of the Nanavati Commission. But what about the left parties? Will they withdraw their support to the government now, or will they simply gloss over it and behave as if it were all a bad dream?

 Yours faithfully,

Farida Khan, Bangalore

 Sir ? Uddalak Mukherjee deserves to be thanked for his excellent piece, ?Lest we forget? (Feb 3). The Nanavati Commission has not mentioned that the local leaders who led the killer mobs were handsomely rewarded with ministerial berths. The retired judge has summarily absolved the Rajiv Gandhi government of any culpability in the pogrom. 

 Encouraging communal violence has always been a favourite sport of our political leaders. Three of the top leaders of undivided India were the prime architects of the Partition. The media and the intelligentsia must expose the misdeeds of our leaders instead of trying to ?shield India?s youth from disturbing elements of the past?, as the chief of the censor board observed in the context of Amu. Would the board be happy to see our youth turn a blind eye to social injustice and sectarian violence? Incidentally, the fact that our prime minister has asked for a personal screening of the film appears odd because Manmohan Singh too had turned a blind eye to the bloodshed in 1989. 

 Yours faithfully,

Jayanta Dutta, Calcutta

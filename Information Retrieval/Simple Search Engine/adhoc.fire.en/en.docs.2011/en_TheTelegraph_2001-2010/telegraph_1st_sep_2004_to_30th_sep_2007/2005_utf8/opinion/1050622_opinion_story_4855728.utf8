 THE WINNING COMBINATION

 Going by past performance, the RJD has the best chances in the coming assembly polls. But in Bihar, you never know, says Sanjay Kumar

 Back in business

 It may be too early to predict which party will win and which will lose in the assembly elections which have been necessitated by the dissolution of the Bihar assembly. But early signs suggest that the electoral prospects of parties will depend on the alliances they strike up, since there has been hardly any change in the social base of the parties in the past few months. The loyalties of the voters in Bihar are so sharply divided that neither the dissolution of the house nor the mud-slinging by the parties will affect their political preferences. Thus the prospects of the parties can only be gauged by their past electoral performance.

 In the last assembly elections, the Rashtriya Janata Dal not only emerged as the single largest party, winning 75 assembly seats, but it also polled the maximum percentage of votes (25.07 per cent). The Bharatiya Janata Party won 37 seats and got 10.97 per cent votes, the Janata Dal (United) won 55 seats and 14.55 per cent votes, while the Lok Janshakti Party won 29 seats and polled 12.62 per cent votes, and the Congress 10 assembly seats and 5 per cent votes. One may say that the RJD got the largest percentage of votes because it contested the most seats. But even in terms of percentage of votes polled per seat contested, the RJD leads the race. Laloo Prasad Yadav?s party polled 28.35 per cent votes, followed by the JD(U) with 26.41 per cent, while the BJP got 24.91 per cent votes for every seat contested. 

 The LJP won 29 assembly seats, but its vote share per seat contested is much lower (17.33 per cent) compared to the other leading parties, except the Congress which polled 14.43 per cent votes per seats contested. This shows that though the RJD suffered a loss of 40 seats compared to the 2000 assembly elections (when it won 115 seats), it still remains the most popular party, going by votes polled. More important, the RJD also came second in 96 assembly seats. It lost in 14 constituencies by less than 3,000 votes. 

 By every parameter then, the RJD seems to be in a position to pose a formidable challenge to any political party or alliance in Bihar. Besides, it is unlikely that since the assembly elections earlier this year, the RJD has lost the support of Yadavs and Muslims, who voted for it in large numbers. The findings of a post-poll survey conducted by the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies indicate that 78 per cent Yadavs and 42 per cent Muslims voted for the RJD alliance, in which the Communist Party of India, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Nationalist Congress Party were partners.

 Ram Vilas Paswan probably believes that by sticking to his promise not to align with the BJP or the RJD, his popularity has greatly increased, but the reality could be very different. Now with the house dissolved, LJP legislators are upset with the party leadership for not reaching an agreement with other parties to form a government. With the split in the LJP, Paswan may have lost many of the candidates who won in the February 2005 elections. Though his stature may have gone up among Muslims for his championing of a Muslim chief minister in Bihar, will it be sufficient to attract more Muslims votes? The findings of the CSDS post-poll survey indicate that Paswan had more support among the Kurmi and upper-caste voters compared to Muslims. The question is, can Paswan project his party as the real alternative and hold on to the support he could muster in February?

 The National Democratic Alliance will accuse the ruling United Progressive Alliance of sabotaging the mandate of the people, and make it an issue in the elections to be held later this year. But in the sharply polarized society of Bihar, it will find few buyers for its grouse except for the Kurmis, Koeris and the upper castes, who have traditionally supported the NDA. The CSDS survey suggests that 47 per cent Kurmis and Koeris, and 49 per cent of the upper-caste voters favoured the NDA in February. If the NDA is to improve upon its performance, it might have to try to consolidate its support among these sections of voters.

 The Congress contested the February 2005 assembly polls separately and won only 10 seats. Of these, the RJD did not field a candidate in eight seats, which were left to the Congress. Not surprisingly, the Congress managed to get some support in these constituencies among Yadavs, Muslims and the Dalits; it did not get much support from other communities. This time round, the Congress is faced with the dilemma about whether to ally with the RJD or the LJP if the latter decides not to have any truck with the RJD. In case the Congress sides with the RJD alliance, it will certainly improve the prospects of both. The results of the February elections suggest that had the Congress contested together with the RJD, the alliance would have won 102 seats. The Congress thus has little hope of improving its performance if it decides to contest the forthcoming assembly elections alone.

 Given the sharply divided political loyalties, the coming elections can hardly throw up any surprises unless there are changes in political alliances. All the parties would like to broaden their alliances. But it seems unlikely that the NDA will be able to bring in any new allies in Bihar. In the circumstances, it may not be easy for the NDA to improve its score. The NDA had been hoping to ride on some kind of a sympathy wave if elections were held early, but with the polls being scheduled tentatively for November, any sympathy wave in its favour will have faded out.

 For its part, the RJD will be looking to the Congress and the LJP as potential allies. If Laloo Yadav succeeds in roping them in, there will be no doubts about the UPA coming back to power in Bihar. Had the UPA contested the February elections as one entity, it could have won 168 assembly seats and easily formed the government. But, of course, Yadav will not have an easy time getting Paswan to agree to an alliance with him. 

 But Yadav too has reasons not to be complacent. Though the RJD emerged as the single largest party in terms of seats and vote share in February, the average victory margin of RJD candidates ? at 9,936 votes ? was the smallest. For the BJP, the average victory margin was 13,333 votes, for the JD(U), 11,687 votes, and for the Congress, it was 15,759 votes. It was only the LJP whose candidates averaged a victory margin lower than the RJD at 8,569 votes.

 If there are no changes in alliances until the next elections, even a slight swing can change the results in at least 31 assembly constituencies where the victory margin had been less than 2,000 votes. And in such a situation, the LJP and the RJD, more than the NDA, would be vulnerable to losing seats it had won the last time. The NDA would then be the biggest gainer, albeit by default.

 PARTY SHOULD BE SECOND

 In the Indian polity, there is a tenuous relationship between the party and the government. The relationship is unhealthy, since the two should be absolutely separate, especially as the interests and the priorities of the party are often different from those of the government. A recent example of this is Ms Sonia Gan- dhi?s handling of affairs in Kashmir. Three years ago, after the elections in Kashmir, there was a clear understanding between the Congress and the People?s Democratic Party that power would be shared and that the chief minister belonging to the PDP would rule for the first half of the term, and then it would be the turn of the Congress. Mr Mufti Mohammad Sayeed served the first term and was ready to relinquish power as per the terms of the agreement between the two partners. But Ms Gandhi was not initially very keen that the Congress should take over the reins of government in Kashmir. There were good reasons behind this reluctance. For one thing, Mr Sayeed had brought a semblance of stability to the state. He had earned the support and goodwill of the Kashmiris. By the logic of good governance, it seemed wise not to change horses mid-course. But Ms Gandhi would not go so far as to say that Mr Sayeed should carry on and complete the full five years. She merely wanted to extend his term without even setting a time-table. Mr Sayeed quite rightly refused such an extension, and now comes the announcement that Mr Ghulam Nabi Azad is to be the Congress chief minister of Kashmir.

 This decision is wrong for more reasons than one. First, it comes after some dithering, which is extremely unfair on Mr Sayeed. Second, it removes a chief minister who had established a good track record. What is worse is that both the dithering and the final decision follow not from reasons of good governance but to satisfy the interests of the party. The Congress members of the legislative assembly in Kashmir and their spokesmen in the capital, have forced Ms Gandhi?s hand. The Congress president has succumbed to the pressure because she is unable or unwilling to place the interests of good governance above narrow party interests. What is alarming is that she has shown a propensity to do this on other occasions as well. There were reports a few weeks ago that failed politicians owing allegiance to the Congress would be nominated to the board of nationalized banks; there was even a move, scotched at the last minute, to put people on the board of ONGC as rewards for loyalty.

 By placing party above governance, Ms Gandhi is, in fact, taking a leaf out of the book of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in West Bengal. There the distinction between party and government has become so blurred as to become non-existent. This has harmed West Bengal. Ms Gandhi?s decision will harm Kashmir and eventually India. If she wants to remain India?s numero uno, she will have to rethink her priorities with regard to the party and the government, as well as the party and the nation.

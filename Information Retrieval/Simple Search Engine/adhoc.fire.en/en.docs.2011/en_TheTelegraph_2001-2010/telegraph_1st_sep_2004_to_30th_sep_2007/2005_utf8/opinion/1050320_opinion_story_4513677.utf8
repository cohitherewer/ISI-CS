 DIARY

 Guess who is happiest about Sanjay Nirupam?s exit from the Shiv Sena? His daughter, Shivani. The little girl studies in an upmarket school in Bandra, and all her classmates are supporters of the Congress. As the only young Sainik around, Shivani was often at the receiving end of snide comments. Now she can barely hide her glee. Perhaps the smile on Shivani?s face will compensate somewhat for the loss of the Rajya Sabha membership and the uncertain future that Nirupam faces. But Nirupam has not just changed parties, he is now ready to change colour. He has already stopped wearing his trademark saffron shirts and kurtas. White, the colour of peace and harmony, is his favourite now. But if Nirupam had intended to impress the Congress with his new get-up, he has little chance of succeeding. For even before he could make his first move, his former party colleagues had sent a bulky anonymous mail to bigwigs in the Maharashtra Congress. All the mail contained was a selection of what Nirupam had had to say about Sonia Gandhi, her children and the Congress in articles he had written for the Samna, the Sena?s mouthpiece. Perhaps, Nirupam has had a change of heart as well?

 Constantly in the public eye, little in the lives of politicians remains a secret. Which is why for a long time everyone had been mystified about Arun Jaitley?s disappearance during the lunch break in parliament. The sight of the former Union law minister leaving in his silver Hyundai and returning less than 20 minutes later was familiar to anyone who frequented the Central legislature. But where did he go? The answer, as Jaitley recently revealed, is quite mundane. A diabetic, Jaitley doesn?t like eating inside parliament and neither does he have the time to go home. So he just gets into his car and asks the driver to take a turn. The slandermongers can turn their attentions elsewhere. 

 The roles are reversed this time. For once, events in Mumbai are causing tremors in New Delhi. Raisina Hill is agog with gossip, whispers and rumours. Yes, it is about the Shakti Kapoor sting operation. One deep-throat has it that the prime minister has three CDs featuring ministers from his cabinet. That may be true, or it may not be true. But the Manmohan Singh camp is faced with a new worry ? now if anyone is dropped in the next reshuffle, there?ll be a host of insinuations to contend with. Well, you could kill a man?s career with less.

 In politics, you always live to see another day. Ask M Venkaiah Naidu, who, people say, is all set to stage a comeback as the BJP?s acting president, understudy to LK Advani who is fast losing his shine. What a change from the time, not too long ago, when Naidu was made to carry the can for the party?s defeat in the general elections and had to resign, with a resurgent Advani taking charge. Now the BJP is even ready to amend its constitution to make way for an acting president. Some would have said that the party needn?t have bothered since Naidu is the ?acting? president anyway. 

 But Advani will have to go, predict the wags. How can a party which abides by the principle of ?one man-one post? allow Advani to carry on as president, when he is also leader of the opposition? And even if the BJP had no problems with compromising on its principles, big brother RSS wasn?t about to let it pass. What goes up, come down after all.

 If the RSS is attempting to set its backyard in order, the VHP has the nation on its mind. Ashok Singhal?s meeting with Chandra Shekhar last week has not escaped notice. Given the former?s suggestion that the time had come to form an alternative Hindutva party, replacing the BJP, and the proclivities of the latter, it?s obvious that the two are looking at ways to put up an anti-Congress, anti-BJP front. Some people just can?t do without some kind of excitement.

 Kalyan Singh is a man whose time has come, and gone. Only he doesn?t realize it. The MP from Bulandshahr is miffed at being ignored in the Lok Sabha. He is no longer part of the BJP galaxy of stars. The two-time CM of Uttar Pradesh, who once threatened Atal Bihari Vajpayee, has not even made his maiden speech in the house. No TV reporter comes to him asking for quotes. They flock to a batch of younger, more telegenic faces in the party. Kalyan had better reconcile to his diminution ? the days of the Ram rajya are long past.

 Najma Heptullah may no longer be a part of the Congress, but the former deputy chairperson of the Rajya Sabha hasn?t stopped offering advice to the party leaders. Her latest salvo ? the Congress had made a mistake by naming the airport in Hyderabad after Rajiv Gandhi. Apparently, after Indira Gandhi?s death, some admirers had suggested that some trains be named after her. Rajiv Gandhi too had seemed to like the idea, initially, but when Najma had pointed out that if the trains ran late ? as they would ? people would say, ?Indira Gandhi is coming late?, he had quickly reconsidered the proposal. Najma might have saved the Congress this terrible slight to the memory of the original Mrs G, but she can?t seem to keep her achievement to herself. To be fair to her, however, she has been too long in the Congress to get over the party in a hurry. In other words, you can take Najma out of the Congress, but you can?t take the Congress out of Najma.

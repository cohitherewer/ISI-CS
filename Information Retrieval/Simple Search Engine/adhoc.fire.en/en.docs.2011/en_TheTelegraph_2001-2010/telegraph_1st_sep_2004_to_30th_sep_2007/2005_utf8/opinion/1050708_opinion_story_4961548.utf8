 TWO TO TRAVEL

 It is impossible to think of population control in India without invoking public exemplars, incentives and disincentives. The logic of these controls is unexceptionable, but at the highest levels of the state, important people have stopped short of imposing these measures comprehensively. They have somehow not felt entirely right, given the breadth of Indian social inequalities. Hence, although it is estimated that India?s population in 2050 will be 1.62 billion (250 million more than China?s in the same year), no bill could be introduced in parliament, or the 79th amendment bill to the Constitution revived, in order to bar those with more than two children from contesting elections. The issue has come to the fore again after Mr Ravi Prakash Gupta petitioned the Delhi high court for a bar on people with more than two children from not only getting government jobs but also from rail and bus reservations. And it is the latter constraint that shows up the inherent oddity of such laws, and why a democracy thinks several times, and for decades, before putting them in place.

 The Supreme Court had previously upheld a law in Haryana which debars people with more than two children from entering the panchayats and zilla parishads. In doing so the court had rejected the argument based on fundamental rights, since contesting an election is not a fundamental right. Nor does such a bar curb religious freedom, according to the court. This was then applied later to the municipality in Haryana. The bar is moving upwards, stopping short now of members of parliament and legislative assemblies. Yet, when last year, Mr Narendra Modi sought to impose the two-children norm on all elected representatives in Gujarat, by invoking ?national interest?, the matter ? given Gujarat?s sectarian history ? began to look sinister. This time, the words of the petitioner, Mr Gupta, also resonated with dubious energies: ?If they keep on crowding this country, eating up its already shrinking resources??. For the Haryana ruling, the court had to particularly mention the fact that ?national interest? could mean social welfare, public order, national morality and collective health. A population of 1.62 billion is serious enough to provoke the courts to send out an urgent message to Indians. Yet, not allowing large families to reserve places for them on trains and buses will make most democratic policymakers uncomfortable.

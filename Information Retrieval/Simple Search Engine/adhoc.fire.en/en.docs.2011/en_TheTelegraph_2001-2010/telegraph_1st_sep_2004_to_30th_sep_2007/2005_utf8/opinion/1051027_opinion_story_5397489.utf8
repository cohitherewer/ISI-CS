 Letters to Editor

 Life imprisonment

 Sir ? The report, ?Monkeys under zoo stress? (Oct 20), that provides details about the deliberate self-mutilation by captive primates in Indian zoos was a horrifying reminder of the fact that these intelligent, social animals do not belong to a life in captivity. In 1992, Bill Travers, founder of the UK-based Born Free Foundation, first coined the term ?zoochosis? to describe obsessive, repetitive behaviour in captive animals, and described zoo animals behaving abnormally as ?zoochotic?. The terms are now widely recognized as people are becoming increasingly aware of the cruelty involved in keeping animals in captivity. This sickness is marked by symptoms such as pacing, neck twisting, head-bobbing, biting of cage bars, and other repetitive behaviours. Sadly, zoochosis is very common; a global study found zoochosis to be rampant in incarcerated animals. There is no justification for keeping animals in cages for our fleeting distraction and amusement.

 Yours faithfully,

Jennifer O?Connor, Norfolk, Virginia, US

 Odd man out

 Sir ? I cannot but disagree with the editorial, ?Right post? (Oct 24). There might be some truth in the contention that N.R. Nayarana Murthy?s expertise would be more relevant to the running of the Bangalore International Airport than to its making. But one cannot question the inclusion of a distinguished person like Narayana Murthy, who has been singularly responsible for Bangalore?s international repute, in the project. The thing that raises question is the alacrity with which he resigned from his position as chairman. Should a thorough professional like him have taken such a hasty decision? His behaviour in fact shows his intolerance for criticism, which is a typical Indian trait. Narayana Murthy could have confronted the former prime minister, H.D. Deve Gowda, with a rebuttal of the allegation that he has done nothing to hasten the airport project. Instead, the clarifications have come after the resignation. The country needs the involvement of its pre-eminent citizens in civic projects. It would, in fact, benefit if politicians like Deve Gowda had nothing to do with them.

 Yours faithfully, 

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad

 Sir ? H.D. Deve Gowda may think that he has scored a brownie point through his tirade against the Infosys chief, but he has actually begun digging his own grave. When real estate dealers and politicians grab land and cheat people, deals are regularized at alarming speed. When honest industrialists purchase land for generating employment, for bringing revenue to the government and prestige to the country, politicians cannot tolerate it. Perhaps the Congress has made a serious blunder in having a coalition with the Janata Dal (S), which is posing to be no less a problem for it than the BJP. But then, there is hardly any difference between the secular and the communal in politics. Both are pretences to garner as much vote as possible. Had it not been so, a former Shiv Sainik like Narayan Rane could not have found place in the secular Congress. In Karnataka, B.B. Shivappa, who had joined the Congress in 2002 from the BJP, is going back to the saffron fold. There is a need to blacklist politicians, and not executives, who do disservice to the nation. 

 Yours faithfully,

B.S. Ganesh, Bangalore 

 Sir ? Notwithstanding N.R. Narayana Murthy?s clean image and H.D. Deve Gowda?s obvious motives, some of the issues raised by the former prime minister need to be clarified. In fact, the reputation of either Narayana Murthy or Deve Gowda need not cloud the issue here. There is no doubt that Deve Gowda?s remark about the Infosys chief was avoidable, and he should have checked his facts before commenting. For political bickering of this sort is not only stalling the progress of Karnataka but is also preventing persons like Narayana Murthy from discharging their duties. In the final analysis, it is the people who suffer. Shouldn?t politicians too think over their contribution to society, especially before pointing fingers at those who have worked hard enough to provide employment to thousands of people. Narayana Murthy?s contribution to putting India on the world software map is well-known. He certainly does not need a certificate of honesty from politicians. The Infosys chief should stick to his decision and stay away from the Bangalore International Airport. 

 Yours faithfully,

Suman Barthakur, Guwahati

 Sir ? The circumstances under which N.R. Narayana Murthy resigned from the chairmanship of the Bangalore International Airport project, a consortium building India?s first greenfield airport, does not enhance Bangalore?s image as an investment destination. Whatever little progress the Rs 1,300-crore airport project has made in the last five years, has been possible because of Narayana Murthy?s efforts in cutting through red tape. His clout in New Delhi and Bangalore is well known. He is a much-respected face of India and a symbol of corporate propriety.

 Yours faithfully,

J.S. Acharya, Hyderabad

 Help at hand

 Sir ? I would like to place on record my appreciation for the police officers of the Gariahat police station for the prompt and sympathetic way in which they responded to my call at 4 in the morning recently. Two unidentified men, with their faces covered and carrying a heavy iron rod, broke into our ground floor flat at Ballygunge Place by forcing open the backdoor. One of the men threatened my teenaged daughter with the iron rod, while the other tore my bed sheet and tied up my hands, feet and mouth. They ran away when my young daughter, quite incredibly, managed to snatch away the iron rod from the man holding it. The intention of the men remains unclear, as they took only my wallet with about Rs 200 in it, when they could have stolen many other valuables. 

 Two officers from the Gariahat police station arrived within 10 minutes of my telephoning them and made a thorough on-the-spot enquiry. My request for a police picket near the premises at night was respected and two policemen were sent the next night and the subsequent 10 others. This went a long way in allaying our fears. While investigations were on, we received a threat call at 8 pm on October 11, warning us that the same action would be repeated. A sub-inspector from the police station visits us regularly and enquires after our well-being whenever he is on night patrol. We are extremely grateful to him and his force.

 Yours faithfully,

Indrani Dutt, Calcutta

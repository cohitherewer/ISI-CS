 UNCLE SAM?S NOD

 Even cynics will concede that a major breakthrough in India?s relations with the United States of America has been achieved. By virtually recognizing India as a nuclear weapons state, Washington is finally changing a policy that it has stridently sustained for over thirty years. There can be no doubt, therefore, that Mr Manmohan Singh?s visit to the US has yielded unprecedented dividends. India had been the target of US sanctions since 1974 when it first exploded a nuclear device. It had been denied civil nuclear technology, space technology, fuel for the Tarapur nuclear power plant and even access to advanced technology, which could potentially have had dual ? civil and military ? uses. While it is not publicly well known, India?s nuclear and space programmes suffered many setbacks because of this US regime of denial. Even Indian scientists in the nuclear and space fields were not allowed to meet their US counterparts at Nasa or Lawrence Livermore. After 1998, following the Pokhran-II nuclear tests, these sanctions became both more extensive and intensive. While the bilateral dialogue between the then foreign minister, Mr Jaswant Singh, and the US deputy secretary of state, Mr Strobe Talbott, led to a warming of relations, there was no major shift in US policy. Similarly, when President George W. Bush announced the Next Steps in the Strategic Partnership last year, there was a promise of a policy change, but no time frame was announced. 

 This is all set to change now with the US recognition of India as a responsible state with advanced nuclear technology, and the US concession that India should acquire the same benefits and advantages as other such states. The US has committed that Mr Bush would seek agreement from the US Congress to adjust US nonproliferation laws and policies to enable full civil nuclear energy cooperation and trade with India. This includes help with fuel supplies for nuclear reactors at Tarapur. In turn, India committed itself on four issues. New Delhi agreed to identify and separate its civilian and military nuclear facilities, and eventually put its civil facilities under international safeguards. India also agreed to continue its unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing. The prime minister also agreed to work with the US for the conclusion of a multilateral Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty. New Delhi reiterated that it would not transfer enrichment and reprocessing technologies to states that do not have them, and support international efforts to limit their spread. 

 Some of these commitments might generate controversy at home, but there is no doubt that these are in tune with the national interest on which there is a near-consensus across political parties. The US too is driven by its national interest. It sees India as a strategic partner in a potentially unstable Asia. Clearly, the most fruitful relationships in international politics are those that are rooted in common interests and common values. On present evidence, India and the US share these in considerable measure.

 NO BIG BANG

 Mr Vijay Kelkar is no longer around in North Block. But the two Kelkar task-force reports on direct and indirect taxes and the third one on implementation of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act argued that the roadmap for deficit-reduction should have front-loading. The FRBM visualizes a zero revenue deficit in 2008-09, the original deadline of 2007-08 having been pushed back a year by the United Progressive Alliance. There is no denying that the macro-environment continues to be conducive, measured by growth in gross domestic product or inflation or accretion to foreign exchange reserves. In 2004-05, the finance minister had promised a revenue deficit/GDP ratio of 2.5 per cent. Whether that target will be attained remains to be seen. But even if it is, slashing the revenue deficit by 0.7 percentage points of GDP a year will not be easy, especially if one factors in the argument about front-loading and packing in the punch of deficit reductions in the initial years. As Mr Kelkar himself argued, scope for expenditure contraction is limited, without factoring in the national common minimum programme commitments. 

 The finance minister?s focus will thus be on increasing the tax/GDP ratio from the present figure of around 10 per cent if one only includes Central taxes, and 15 per cent if one includes all indirect taxes. The goal of increasing the tax/GDP ratio is not in question, the issue is the means adopted for the increase. In his dream budget for 1997-98, Mr P. Chidambaram had adopted the strategy of low rates and rationalization. Splice that with the reformer?s argument of removing discretions and exemptions. Contours of reform already exist in various Kelkar proposals. But emboldened by the education cess of 2004-05, goaded by the left and driven by his dream of unleashing schemes to unearth black income, the finance minister will probably stay away from substantive tax reform. Exemptions on personal and corporate income tax will continue, the peak corporate tax rate will not be unified with the peak personal tax rate and discretionary adjustments will remain. Nor will there be unifying steps towards a common goods and service tax. Indeed, the unified state sales tax due from April 2005, euphemistically called value added tax, allows such discretion in rates. Pleading inadequate time for budget preparation in 2004-05, Mr Chidambaram suggested a big bang on tax reform in 2005-06. That seems unlikely.

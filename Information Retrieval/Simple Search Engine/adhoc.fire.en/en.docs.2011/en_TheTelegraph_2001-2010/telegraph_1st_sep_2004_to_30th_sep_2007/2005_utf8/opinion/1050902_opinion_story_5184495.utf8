 A STEP AHEAD

 Constitutional debates are important in so far as they improve on existing laws and become a guide to future action. The Supreme Court?s forthcoming verdict on the petition challenging the dissolution of the Bihar assembly could be an important constitutional milestone. At the heart of the matter is the role of the governor of a state. It would be a political setback for the United Progressive Alliance government if the court rejects the action of Bihar?s governor, Mr Buta Singh, as unconstitutional. It would be even more embarrassing for the government if the court rules in favour of reviving the dissolved assembly. History will be made if the governor is summoned to explain his recommendation before the constitutional bench. But, to constitutional purists, what the court rules on the role and conduct of the gubernatorial office will be the most significant outcome of the case. The constitution leaves the matter too open-ended to be good for a democracy. It cannot be healthy constitutional practice that leaves important matters of state to the ?discretion? of an individual. The flawed provision has long made the office of the governor vulnerable to all kinds of manipulations. Whether a governor works in a fair or a partisan manner is only a peripheral issue. The real problem lies with the constitutional lacuna. It is time the role and functions of the governor were clearly defined in the Constitution. The court should set the guidelines for a suitable constitutional amendment. 

 In a significant way, the judgment in the Bihar case would be seen as an advance on the verdict in the Bommai case in 1994. There is an important difference though. In the Bommai case, the governor?s action came under judicial scrutiny following the dismissal of an elected government. Mr Buta Singh dissolved the House after the elections in the state threw up a hung assembly. Before he did so, he had kept the assembly in suspended animation in the hope, as he claimed, that some of the contending political parties would come together to form a majority. The trouble is that such actions by governors are rarely above suspicion in a system in which they are seen as agents of ruling parties at the Centre. In its judgment in the Bommai case, the court sought to lay down guidelines for the use of Article 356 and for other functions of a governor. But it clearly was not enough to clean up the mess at the Raj Bhavans.

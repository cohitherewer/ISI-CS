 THE HIDDEN COSTS OF CONFLICT

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the Human Development Report 2005 

 In the Democratic Republic of the Congo deaths attributable directly or indirectly to conflict exceed the losses sustained by Britain in the First World War and Second World War combined. In the Darfur region of Sudan nearly 2 million people have been displaced because of conflict. The immediate victims of these and other conflicts periodically make it into the international media spotlight. But the long-run human development impact of violent conflict is more hidden.

 Conflict undermines nutrition and public health, destroys education systems, devastates livelihoods and retards prospects for economic growth. Of the 32 countries in the low human development category as measured by the human development index, 22 have experienced conflict at some time since 1990. Countries that have experienced violent conflict are heavily overrepresented among the group of countries that are off track for the millennium development goals in our projections for 2015. Of the 52 countries that are reversing or stagnating in their attempts to reduce child mortality, 30 have experienced conflict since 1990. The immensity of these costs makes its own case for conflict prevention, conflict resolution and post-conflict reconstruction as three fundamental requirements for building human security and accelerating progress towards the MDGs.

 Part of the challenge can be traced to weak, fragile and failing states. Compounded failures to protect people against security risks, to provide for basic needs and to develop political institutions perceived as legitimate are standing features of conflict-prone states. In some cases deep horizontal inequalities between regions or groups are a catalyst for violence. The ?failure? of states such as Afghanistan and Somalia was facilitated by the willingness of external powers to intervene in pursuit of their own strategic goals. Imports of weapons and the capture by narrow interest groups of the flows of finance from the sale of natural resources help to sustain and intensify conflict. Political leadership in conflict-prone states is a necessary condition for change, but not a sufficient one. Rich countries also need to provide leadership.

 Weak and fragile states are not just underaided in relation to their ability to use finance effectively, but also subjected to high levels of unpredictability in aid flows. Evidence suggests that aid flows are 40 per cent lower than would be justified by the institutions and policy environment. The nature and sequencing of aid is another problem. Too often donors make large commitments of humanitarian aid in immediate post-conflict periods without following through to support economic recovery in subsequent years.

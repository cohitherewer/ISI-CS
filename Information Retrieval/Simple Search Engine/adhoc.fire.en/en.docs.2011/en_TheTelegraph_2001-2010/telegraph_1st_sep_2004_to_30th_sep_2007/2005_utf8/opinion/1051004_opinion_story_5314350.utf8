 ENEMY WITHIN

 Scurrilous rhetoric is no substitute for either policy or action. The present regime in Dhaka seems to be afflicted by a strange obsession to bait India on every conceivable pretext. The chief of the Bangladesh Rifles, Major General Jehangir Alam Choudhury, only did it more brazenly. Events in his own country would nail the lie in his remark that India was behind the serial bomb blasts there last month. It was a banned Islamist outfit in Bangladesh that openly claimed the responsibility for the strike. Several hundred Bangladeshis, including a leader of the group, were arrested. Mr Choudhury?s allegation, therefore, had more of an air of posturing than any substance. But it must have seriously harmed attempts to improve relations between the two countries. New Delhi would justifiably see it as a setback to the process that the foreign secretaries of the two countries had started last June. Even if that process had left many of the issues unresolved, it was a beginning that promised to break the ice. 

 The latest setback could not have come at a worse time, especially for Bangladesh. Dhaka is to host the summit meeting of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation next month. When two earlier sessions of the meeting were postponed, Bangladesh blamed it on India. Dhaka has only itself to blame if New Delhi?s attitudes harden on the eve of next month?s session. Mr Choudhury?s unprovoked accusation ? that too during a visit to New Delhi ? can only strengthen South Block?s case for a tougher policy towards Dhaka. It is important to understand that Mr Choudhury?s indiscretion was no isolated episode. When a ghastly grenade attack killed seventeen and injured over two hundred Bangladesh Awami League activists in Dhaka last year, the accusing finger was similarly pointed at India. Such reactions have become Dhaka?s ploy to counter New Delhi?s complaints about the militants in India?s north-east operating from across the border. Dhaka refuses to see that India?s po- sition on both the fencing of the border and the north-eastern militants stems from a major security concern. It is time the government of Ms Khaleda Zia realized that India cannot compromise on its security. The rise of Islamist fundamentalism in Bangladesh too has worsened India?s fears. Ms Zia would do better to look for the enemy within.

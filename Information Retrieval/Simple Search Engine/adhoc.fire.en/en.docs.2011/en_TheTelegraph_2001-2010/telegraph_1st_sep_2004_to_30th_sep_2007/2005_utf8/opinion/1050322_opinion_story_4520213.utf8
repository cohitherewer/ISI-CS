 BRUTAL ACTION

 Closing doors after the event is a pointless exercise, as the horse-and-stable tale illustrates. The prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, however, is at least engaging in the exercise before all the tigers have vanished from the country. His initiative has more than one level. The decision to ban gifts of animals to other countries is not only welcome but is also an expos? of the incredible insensitivity of successive Indian governments to wildlife. Even more reassuring is the prime minister?s response to the shocking revelation about the diminished tiger count. Forming a task force dedicated to the status of tigers in national parks across the country is just one aspect of a multiple-pronged approach. The scale of criminal activity that has led to the drastic drop in the number of tigers from its fairly healthy peak in the late Eighties can only be speculated upon. For this, there will now be the National Wildlife Crime Prevention and Control Bureau to tackle poaching. Mr Singh has also ordered the Central Bureau of Investigation to look into the causes of the depletion ? perhaps disappearance ? of tigers in Sariska National Park in Rajasthan.

 The success of Project Tiger, initiated in the early Seventies, has been completely sabotaged by the growth of high-tech, organized poaching and the rising value of tiger parts in the international market. The poaching has to be placed within the web of corruption and negligence that permeates wildlife preservation. The nexus of poachers and forest officials is certainly one of the chief causes, but it is also true that wildlife reserves are low priority in a state?s concerns. Forest officials are often not equipped, even in the most basic sense, to cope with the efficient functioning of poachers? networks. Besides, indifference to the given job is not new in the Indian system; especially when the job is a transferable one. Around this intricate web of potential destruction, which includes the light penalty poachers face when caught, there are other forms of assault too: tree-felling, the unconsidered, often illegal, building of roads through the parks for commercial traffic and tourists, the still enormous ignorance about animal illnesses and inadequate facilities to deal with them. Mr Singh has taken on a complex task. But, if the present count is anywhere near the truth, there is still time to turn things around, as had begun to happen in the early Seventies.

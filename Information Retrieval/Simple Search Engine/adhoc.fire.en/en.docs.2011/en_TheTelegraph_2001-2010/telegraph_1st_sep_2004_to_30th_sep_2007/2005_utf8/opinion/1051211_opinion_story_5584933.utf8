 CHILD IN NEED

 Childhood is a lost cause in India. The underprivileged child is exposed to hard labour, exploitation and abuse of every kind. The more privileged child, especially in the cities, is overwhelmed by the promises of a more privileged future. But to attain that distant future, the child must start young, trying for better opportunities, long before he realizes what it is he is being worked so hard for. There is no one moment that is free from a schedule of a many-faceted training guaranteed to prune and pull, hone and polish the child into a superlatively talented, efficient, fame- and-money-acquiring organism. Schools and parents have their own ideas about how early children should start performing for their prizes, whether it is admission to a top-notch school or the first prize in a sit-and-draw competition. But the Delhi high court has made it clear that interviews for three-year-olds and their parents for admission into nursery classes would now have to stop. This might turn into a serious ban on interviews from January, if schools do not come up with an alternative method of admission soon.

 The ruthless grooming that toddlers are subject to in the name of excellence ? only the best schools will do ? could be the theme of more than one black comedy. What happens to the mind and personality of a three-year-old who cannot get in? How much does he or she understand of what is being asked and why? What will the school have left to teach? The Delhi high court?s response to a public interest litigation against the practice of interviewing infants for admission into nursery is a welcome relief. Such a point of view ? it is not yet a ruling ? should become a policy, and be implemented throughout the country. That the courts should have to intervene in this matter, or in the matter of the weight a child carries on his back to school every day ? as happened recently ? is an indication of the depths of unthinking cruelty that guardians and school authorities are willing to sink to in the name of learning. Nothing could be further from it.

 There is another dimension to the court?s concern. While the admission policy of schools cannot be part of the court?s lookout, it is also true that there is silence about the unbearable pressure on children from those who should object first: the guardians. The increasing number of student suicides does not seem to have yielded the right lessons. The court?s concern, therefore, hints at an official awareness of the nature of children?s rights. There is no such awareness in India, no signatures on charters have changed that reality. A happy, healthy childhood, with food and work and play, with the time to dream and make, with a solid, all-round, useful education is the right of every child. It is time Indian society began to think on these lines.

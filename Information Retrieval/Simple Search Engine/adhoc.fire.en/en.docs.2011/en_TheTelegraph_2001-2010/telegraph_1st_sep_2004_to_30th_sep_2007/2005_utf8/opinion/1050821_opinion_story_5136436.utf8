 DIARY

 Tie or die. For the hundred-or-so-odd women belonging to families which survived the Bhopal gas tragedy, the choice must have been rather limited. So on holy raksha bandhan day, they stomped into the residence of the Madhya Pradesh CM, Babulal Gaur, and tied the rakhi on his noble wrists. In return, Gaur had to behave like a brother ? protect his sisters that is. Not from lustful men, but from painful death. The women were demanding safe potable water from Gaur, an amenity the highest court in the land had already directed him to provide to the families about four months ago, and which Gaur, caught up as he always is with more urgent matters like the fate of snake-charmers, women?s beauty, the altering of the eating and singing habits of his employees and so on, had not had time to fulfil. But will a rakhi be enough to turn around a delinquent brother? Shazadi Bi sounded optimistic, ?I believe where the court failed, religion will not.? Maybe the judiciary and government should take note of this and pay more attention to raksha bandhan days. 

 It is not merely rakhi-wielding sisters who seem to be bothering Babulal Gaur. There is his former mentor too. The news of Uma Bharti?s acquittal in a flag violation case upset the CM so much that he walked out of a theatre where Mangal Pandey ? The Rising was being screened. Gaur later said that a chest pain had prompted him to abandon the ?otherwise brilliant film?. He may have been right about the pain, but about its location we have serious doubts. Meanwhile, Bharti is said to have had a hearty laugh over the incident although she?s still unsure of how soon she can replace Gaur. As for Babulal, the man is confident of his survival in office. If 45 MLAs could do nothing to Narendra Modi, there is hardly a chance an out-of-office Uma can.

 Blame it on India?s culture of sycophancy or the habit of being needlessly obsequious to authority, but it was greatly amusing to hear the official car of the speaker of the Assam assembly being summoned on the public announcement system in the Parliament House complex as, ?Speaker Assamji ki gaadi gate number ek par laye...Speaker Assamji....?

 There might be a sea change in the Valley shortly. So long, the Congress was unwilling to lay claim on the post of the CM for Jammu and Kashmir once it fell vacant following the three-year stint of the Mufti brigade in October. The party, apparently, did not want to upset the fine balance in the valley. Besides, its star performer, Ghulam Nabi Azad, was reluctant to stray too far away from the capital. Things have changed now. The Congress thinks its unwillingness to occupy the hotseat may be misinterpreted as an indication of its ?hands-off? policy. And Azad himself now seems to have been successfully brainwashed to give it a shot. Incidentally, Azad has never won even a local corporator?s election from the state. 

 Legislators have found a way to block the way of parkatis to parliament ? to sit on the bill. But they have had less success with female property rights. Take the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Bill 2004 for example, which provides equal rights to Hindu, Jain, Buddhist or Sikh women to inherit ancestral property after marriage. The vice-president and chairman of the upper house, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat was opposed to the bill, as were other blue-blooded men like Karan Singh and Digvijay Singh, who had made known their objection in the chairman?s room. When the bill got smoothly passed in the Rajya Sabha, Shekhawat was absent from the house. And not because he objected to it, but because he was busy having his afternoon nap elsewhere. 

 Even at the risk of repeating ourselves, we must insist that there is enough reason to believe that the much-awaited cabinet and AICC reshuffle may take place shortly, that is before the PM leaves for France in early September. There are ministries crying out to be filled ? coal, sports, NRI; there are portfolios that need to be slashed ? Mani Aiyar?s, Ghulam Nabi Azad?s and Jaipal Reddy?s; and there are six states that are unrepresented in the ministry. But that isn?t what is worrying heads in the capital. All that matters is who will get the loaves and fishes and who will get the boot. Watch this space for authentic updates.

 Salt-n-pepper hair (what remains of it), sleeves rolled up, grim expression on face ? Jairam Ramesh takes his job (or should we say himself?) in the Rajya Sabha too seriously. He sits through the long debates in the house and elucidates the finer points of legislative matters to his not-so-gifted colleagues. But even after making full allowances for Ramesh?s academic background, visitors to Central Hall, including his fellow MPs, find it quite amusing to see Ramesh working feverishly on his laptop while all around him legislators indulge in useless banter over subsidized helpings of fresh juice, rasogollas and other snacks. Ramesh, some insist, is always game to zip his laptop back into its case and gossip with whoever approaches him. The problem is the run-of-the-mill MP is so overawed by his intellectual prowess that he tends to leave Ramesh all alone. Perforce, Jairam feels obliged to continue working on his PC while the circus goes on around him.

 VATICAN VOWS

 The saying that there is a tide in the affairs of men sometimes gets confirmed in strange ways which can often be swept aside as mere coincidence. Through the long ministry of Pope John Paul II, there was a resurgence of orthodoxy within the Roman Catholic Church. But this rise of religious fundamentalism was not a phenomenon confined to Christianity. There was a rise in Sikh fundamentalism in India. In Afghanistan, Pakistan and across west Asia, Islamist ideologies swept the board. In India again there was the revival of Hindu fanaticism. It perhaps will not be an exaggeration to suggest that within the Roman Catholic Church, John Paul II represented what was actually a global trend. His death in this context is timely. Globally, it is the ebb tide of religious fundamentalism. Hindu extremism in India has suffered severe losses; Sikh militancy is dead; and Islamic fundamentalism may not be defeated, but is under severe pressure wherever it exists. The 21st century, in fact, began with a dramatic shift in public opinion against all forms of fundamentalism. If there is a tide in the affairs of men, then that tide appears to be in favour of reform and liberalism.

 That generalization is, however, belied by the choice of the cardinals in the Sistine Chapel. They chose Josef Ratzinger to be the new vicar of Christ. The new pope will be known as Benedict XVI. The choice is not surprising and the speed of the cardinals? conclave ? one of the shortest in memory ? suggests that there was a remarkable degree of unanimity among the electors. It would appear that the cardinals have voted for continuity rather than change. Pope Benedict XVI, when he was a mere cardinal, was known for his strong orthodox views. He is well known within the church for his knowledge of theology. He is equally feared because of his intolerance of dissent. Reform of the Roman Catholic Church may not be on the agenda of the new pope. He is known for his strong doctrinaire views on homosexuality, contraception and sex outside marriage. He might bring joy to conservative Roman Catholics in Africa and Asia, but not to liberal-minded churchgoers in western Europe.

 It is ironic that the new pope comes from Germany, the area from which the most significant opposition to the Vatican emerged in the 16th century. The choice of name by the new pope is no less significant. St Benedict laid down the disciplinary foundations of monasticism. The choice is obviously a gesture towards greater discipline and spirituality ? virtues which are often the first two signposts to religious fundamentalism. It is possible, of course, that under Benedict XVI, the Roman Church will not play as important a role as it did in the mundane sphere under his predecessor. The City of God might remain untouched by affairs in the City of Man.

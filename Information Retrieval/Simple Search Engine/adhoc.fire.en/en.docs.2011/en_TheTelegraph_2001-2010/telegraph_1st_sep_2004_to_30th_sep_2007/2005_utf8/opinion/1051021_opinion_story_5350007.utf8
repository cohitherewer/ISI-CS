 POWER BY ANY OTHER NAME

 Almost an Ambassador By Rajiv Dogra, Srishti, Rs 145

 Almost an Ambassador by Rajiv Dogra is a fantasy set in the imaginary Caribbean state of Princetown and the desert kingdoms of Tertia and Inertia. Doot, the ambassador, is a misfit. His father wanted him to be a village postman, his wife told him to go climb trees. This is an ode to diplomatic intrigue and ambition. Doot begins by questioning the scriptures and establishes himself as a politician. He marries Sundari, the daughter of the village neta, and embarks on a life of power and pelf. Caught in an unhappy marriage, he channels all his energy into becoming a perfect ambassador. 

 In the desert kingdoms of Tertia and Inertia ? loose disguises for the Middle East ? Doot displays valour in conflict. The book delineates the power of the sheikhs and the treachery of politics. Scenes of war and bombing predominate, recreating the wasted battle-fields of the Middle East.

 Doot never really outgrows his roots. He is a simple man at heart who lost his parents in communal riots. His father had also been tricked out of his village in India by a manpower-exporter and shipped thousands of sea-miles away to the Caribbeans. Once there, he had no means of returning, and the village postman became his only contact with India. 

 And here lies the root of bitterness between Doot?s and the Pridewallah?s families. Pridewallah?s father was the village postman. There is evidence of racial conflict between Blacks and Indians as well as of the settlement of Indians as indentured labourers in the Caribbean. The references to Blacks and the Ramayana and historical events are a bit obscure. Doot knows that history is often embroidered with fiction, and facts are distorted to suit the narrator?s viewpoint. But his history was going to be user-friendly. But the movement back and forth between India and the Caribbean is a bit far-fetched. Or maybe that is how people in the Caribbean construct their memories of India.

 There approach to sexual encounters is comic. Wanting to be a Casanova, Doot appears as a bumbling fool. Sundari changes from a svelte lass into a screeching valkyrie. Scenes of domestic violence are common. The affair with Dilruba does not come across as convincing. Albeit his high-flying life as ambassador, Doot is a comic anti-hero. The book is an expos? of the politics of war and coups, of loyalty, love and marital discord. At the end, Doot emerges no wiser than he was at the beginning.

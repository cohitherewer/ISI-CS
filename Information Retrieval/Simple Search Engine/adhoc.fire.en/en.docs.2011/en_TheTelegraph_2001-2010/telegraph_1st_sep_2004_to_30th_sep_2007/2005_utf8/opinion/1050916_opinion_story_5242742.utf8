 DIVIDE AND VOTE

 In a mature democracy, the people vote, not as members of a group, but as free individuals. But elections in India have become contests among politicians to mobilize the voters on caste and communal lines. Community leaders conspire with the politicians to issue fatwas on how a caste or religious group should vote. On the face of it, what some Muslim religious leaders of Bihar have done is somewhat different. They have warned the ?secular? politicians not to take the Muslim vote for granted. They want not only secularism but also benefits for the ?backward classes? of Muslims that are more tangible. But then, all sections of the people want the politicians to promise them all kinds of benefits before the polls. What is new to the Muslim religious leaders? call is the idea of a quid pro quo. The political message seems to be aimed at the two major claimants for the Muslim vote in Bihar ? Mr Laloo Prasad Yadav and Mr Ram Vilas Paswan. The Rashtriya Janata Dal has traditionally drawn its strength from a combination of Muslim and Yadav votes. Mr Paswan?s Lok Janshakti Party began with its base among the Dalits and has since sought to spread it among the backward classes of Muslims. But the Muslim leaders have kept Mr Paswan guessing too; they have dismissed his demand for a Muslim chief minister as a typical poll ploy to win their vote. 

 However, the debate tends to push two important issues to the background. First, it raises the basic question as to whether the leaders, political or religious, have a moral right to manipulate the people?s voting choices. There surely are other religious leaders who would claim to speak for the state?s Muslims or some sections of them. And, there would be still others demanding benefits in the name of the people belonging to different castes. The elections would thus divide the people and pitch one section against another. Second, while the politicians pander to caste or religious groups, the interests of Bihar?s economy and society would be ignored. That has been the story of elections in Bihar for far too long. The state?s slide into economic ruin and social anarchy has largely been due to its caste and communal politics. The last assembly polls showed how desperately the people wanted this state of anarchy to end. These elections too would matter to the people only if they offer hopes of a change in Bihar.

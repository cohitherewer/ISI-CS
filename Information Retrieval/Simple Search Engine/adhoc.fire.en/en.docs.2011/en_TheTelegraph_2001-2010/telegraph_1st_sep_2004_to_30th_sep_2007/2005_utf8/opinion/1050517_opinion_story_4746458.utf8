 Letters to Editor

 Buried in cruelty

 Sir ? The report, ?Agony of Asiad Appu Ends? (May 15), raises a valid question. Is the demand for the ethical treatment of animals applicable only so long as they are alive? Does the principle cease to apply when they die? Not solemnizing the last rites of a dead human being in accordance with his or her religious rites would be deemed immoral. By the same logic, the refusal to offer a strip of land for the burial of Appu ? the elephant who came to be identified with the mascot of the 1982 Asian Games and was the symbol of a defining moment in India?s march towards modernity ? is also immoral. Though at last a kind planter has offered space for the burial, it is clear that we Indians still treat this most benevolent of animals as beasts of burden. We tame them, put them to use and junk them remorselessly when they fall ill or die of the cruelty inflicted by us.

 Yours faithfully,

Sharmistha Dhar, Calcutta

 Flawed thesis

 Sir ? Ramachandra Guha makes a number of sweeping generalizations in ?Where left meets right? (April 30), one of which concerns the campaign against the Nestl? outlet in Jawaharlal Nehru University. It is clear that Guha?s knowledge of the campaign is based on his conversation with his ?wholly non-political? friends. It is sad that a ?historian? like Guha should depend solely on a conversation for his thesis. The campaign against the Nestl? outlet was initiated by a group of students, most of whom had no affiliation to any student organization. They did this not out of some passionately-held ?irrational fear of the foreigner?; they were similarly outraged by big ?indigenous? corporations like Reliance and the Tatas. These students are not guinea pigs for Guha to develop his thesis on the Indian left. 

 The campaign against Nestl? should be seen in the context of the increasing corporatization of campuses across the country and the world, whereby large companies are displacing small-time, local dhaba and canteen owners. Over the past few years, the campus development agenda of the JNU administration has changed. Earlier the policy was to lease out campus space to those who were from economically and socially disempowered backgrounds. But now campus space is being leased out to the highest bidder. The JNU authorities have also been increasing the rent of the existing dhabas and canteens on the campus. Corporatization is not happening in JNU alone. But in campuses around the world corporations are establishing outlets where they can exclusively sell their products, sponsoring events and programmes, funding research projects, starting new courses and contract work. This is gradually eroding the free and democratic nature of educational institutions and turning them into factories that produce the capital and labour required to meet the greed of the profit-hungry rich. 

 If Guha still insists on branding those who campaigned against the Nestl? outlet in JNU as CPI(M) members, then he is giving credit to the CPI(M) for a campaign it was not part of. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The people in the photograph accompanying Ramachandra Guha?s article are clearly campaigning against soft drinks made by foreign companies which contain high levels of pesticides. But though the word ?poison? is painted on both the Coca-Cola and Pepsi bottles, the shape of these cut-outs are providing free publicity to the cola majors at peak hours in the middle of the city?s busiest areas.

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Sir ? I find Ramachandra Guha?s theory ? that the CPI and the RSS share the same view of foreigners because they both held aloof from the Indian freedom struggle ? hard to swallow. No political party in India today needs to tom-tom proof of its patriotism because after 57 years of independence, we, especially the urbanites, have forgotten our freedom struggle. If anyone has doubts, he needs only to take a look at the queues in front of liquor shops on the eve of Independence Day. 

Yours faithfully, 

Sandip Chattopadhyay, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Ramachandra Guha exposes the hypocrisies of the right and the left, both of whom exploit the sentiments of their followers. But before singling them out for criticism, let us not forget that we ? the apolitical general mass of the country ? are guilty of allowing them the space to play out their tamasha.

 Yours faithfully,

 Floor politics 

 Sir ? Was the article, ?Save the last dance? (April 30), a warning to Sonal Mansingh to stay out of politics, or just a well-wisher?s advice to the doyenne of Indian classical dance? It is really sad that this celebrated dancer, who has always been admired by the people and the media alike, should be the object of censure instead of being supported and encouraged for her excellent organizational capabilities. It was only after Mansingh became chairperson of the Sangeet Natak Akademi that the body took note of classical dance and commenced patronage of upcoming dancers from all over the nation. On becoming chairperson of the SNA, Mansingh has been busy with all kinds of development activities for the academy and for the promotion of the arts. She might have done a little more for dance. But that is only to be expected from a dancer. What if someone from another field had headed the academy? His field of the arts would have got top priority. So why the hue and cry?

 Besides, was the caricature that went with the article really necessary?

 Yours faithfully,

Thankamani Kutty, Calcutta

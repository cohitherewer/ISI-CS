 IN HIS 

 OWN 

 IMAGE

 Shyam Benegal refuses to fit to mould. Yet, he is trying to morph into a mainstream filmmaker. Much depends on the fate of his just-released epic on Netaji 

 TURNAROUNDS

 Crossing 

 the floor: 

 GOVIND NIHALANI: Worked 

 with Benegal and then made the gritty Ardh Satya (83) 

 before the hugely different Dev and Thakshak

 NASEERUDDIN SHAH: Worked 

 in Nishant (75) with Benegal before the melodramatic 

 Main Hoon Na (04)

 OM PURI: Was in Benegals 

 Mandi (83) before the romantic Kyun Ho Gaya 

 Na (04).

 Labels, scoffs Shyam Benegal, are a lazy mans tool. They help him tackle uncomfortable questions with convenience. But his just-released film, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose: The Forgotten Hero, holds out evidence that great directors ? like all great men ? can never really get rid of labels. And the latest one sticking to Benegals back reads Middle of Nowhere. 

 For thats exactly where Netaji has landed him. After spending years making arthouse cinema, Benegal has finally taken off his thinking cap and tried his hand at big-budget films. Shot across two continents, and at a cost of what some say is Rs 40 crore, the movie ? like Netajis meeting with Hitler ? is a make-or-break venture for the new Benegal. What a pity it turned out a disaster. Its a nightmare in which Border meets Devdas. And it can please neither Benegals arty critics nor the audiences in the front stalls. It leaves Shyambabu stranded ? neither here nor there. 

 But then, Benegal and labels have always had a thing for each other. When Ankur hit the theatres in 1974, it seemed that he came riding on the crest of a wave ? a wave they called parallel cinema. Even while starting out, he was a very democratic person. He gave each actor his space and though he was the director, everybody on the sets called him Shyam when they spoke to him. The babu came much later, remembers Shabana Azmi, who started her acting career with Ankur. The landmark film, a grim vision of feudal society and its power games in rural India, draws an inspiring performance from Azmi as Lakshmi, the sexually-exploited wife of a deaf-and-mute labourer. 

 And then things started happening thick and fast to Benegal. Nishant released in 1975, Manthan in 1976 ? forming, along with Ankur, Benegals first famous triad of films. In 1979, the International Film Guide named him one of the top five directors in the world. Suddenly, Benegal was everything to everyone. He was one of the pioneers of New Cinema, the new face of the Indian intellectual, the inheritor of Rays legacy ? the labels stuck on.

 The best thing about him is that he selects actors very carefully and encourages them to take risks. Working with him, you know that he will always stop you before you make a fool of yourself in a role ? that is how certain his vision is, says Azmi. And one can see why Benegal inspires such confidence. For one, he brought the best out of some of the most intense actors on the Indian screen ? Naseeruddin Shah, Om Puri and the late Smita Patil have all cut their teeth on his films. 

 It was in the Eighties that Benegal lost his way a bit. Sure, he still had fire in his belly and made good cinema ? anyone who has watched Mandi will vouch for that. But as state-financed cinema floundered with the dying out of institutions like the National Film Development Corporation, Benegal too decided to make a mid-career shift. He started concentrating on TV. Even while shooting for Bharat Ek Khoj in 1988, I was always conscious that I was making something that was going to be around for a long time, remembers Benegal. Based on Jawaharlal Nehrus Discovery of India, the 53-episode serial went on to trace 3,000 years of Indian history. 

 But the small screen never really suited Benegals style ? or his message. A TV serial is like writing in a newspaper, while a film is like working on your own novel, the director points out. When he realised the truth of this and decided to return to the big screen, dynamics in the industry had changed already. The Sooraj Barjatyas and Aditya Chopras had changed the idiom of filmmaking ? and Benegal could feel the generation gap. He tried to stick to his brand of filmmaking with movies like Mammo and Sardari Begum. But Benegal, who had started out working for advertising firms, knew that it was time he got himself an image makeover. With that on his mind, he made Zubeida in 2001 with A.R. Rahman providing the music and Karishma Kapoor as the leading lady. The journey into the mainstream had begun. 

 Which brings us back to Netaji. Benegal, who counts his wife and daughter among his biggest critics, is convinced this has been the greatest effort in his career. I planned an epic and I shot one, he says. But its the dogfight over the movie ? and over who owns Netaji posthumously ? that seems to be taking on epic proportions now. A public interest litigation filed in the Calcutta High Court has asked for the removal of scenes that show Netaji married to Emily Schenkl. A grand open-air world premiere in Calcutta last week was scrapped for a muted, high-security affair this Wednesday at a city multiplex. And tempers have risen over the use of the word forgotten in the title. 

 Amid all this controversy, Benegal is a tired, old man ? and an angry one at that. And tired, old men often make lousy filmmakers. And thats a label which is not going to come off easily.

 Letters to Editor

 Of bulls and bears

 Sir ? Why do stock markets rise and why do they fall? The report, ?Stocks swoon on wild Wednesday? (Jan 6), offers only conjectures ? falling prices in London Metal Exchange and rising interest rates in the US. With nearly Rs 60,000 crore wiped out in a day, is that the best we have to offer? All this confirms the view that the share markets are a game of chance. They aren?t ? not entirely. But it is very convenient if people think so, since the authorities can then continue to shirk putting in place stricter norms, and enforcing them, so that the big fish don?t eat the small. 

 Yours faithfully,

Dilip Guha, Calcutta

 Woman of the year

 Sir ? Sonia Gandhi has indeed proved herself to be a dignified and astute politician (?The conquest of power?, Dec 31). However, the notions of tyaga and inner voice have been gratuitously attributed to her. It undermines the pragmatism of her decision to steer clear of the contentious slot of prime minister and to assume a super-ordinating role, which have added greatly to her stature and ability to fashion a line of succession.

 Yours faithfully,

Bishan Sahai, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is sad that all Rudrangshu Mukherjee can think of remembering 2004 by was Sonia Gandhi?s giving up the prime-ministership. As a developing country, we should remember this year for our successes and failures in switching to a market economy, and not for any political stunt. Whereas I do not believe in the xenophobic cries of Sonia Gandhi being a foreigner and thus unfit to govern India, I seriously believe that Manmohan Singh was a far better alternative. In all seriousness, the finest prime ministers of India have not come from the Nehru-Gandhi family ? think of P.V. Narasimha Rao, Atal Bihari Vajpayee or Manmohan Singh. 

 In the new year, Indians should be more concerned with the challenges that lie ahead, and how to best overcome them. Political gamesmanship can wait.

 Yours faithfully,

Aruni Mukherjee, Coventry, UK

 Cross-batted

 Sir ? Raju Mukherji comes across as rather pugnacious in his article, ?End of a great innings? (Dec 19). While singing praises of Vijay Hazare, he leaves no stone unturned to degrade modern Indian cricketers. Mukherji has every right to prove Hazare?s pre-eminence, but his comments about later-day cricketers are incisive enough to be insulting. He gave evidence of similar traits in his article, ?Uncle Tom out of his cabin?, (Nov 29), where he was disparaging of Clive Lloyd for penalizing Sourav Ganguly? Criticism is alright, but it should always be within the bounds of decency.

 Yours faithfully,

Arunava Chatterjee, Durgapur

 Sir ? Vijay Hazare?s death is certainly a great loss. He was not only the first captain to lead India to a test victory, but he was also regarded as a great batsman, one who stood up to the fast bowlers of his time. He was unassuming and lived simply. Hazare can be an ideal for the present generation of cricketers.

 Yours faithfully,

Debashis Saha, Calcutta

 Sir ? As an admirer of Vijay Hazare, I am shocked to read the comment by the present Indian cricket captain, ?I don?t recall meeting Hazare?? (?One more miss upsets Sourav?, Dec 19). Does Sourav Ganguly realize that his statement can be taken to mean that even if he had met Hazare, the incident has slipped out of his mind? But, perhaps, that is Ganguly?s way of paying tribute to a cricketing legend.

 Yours faithfully,

Soumitra Krishna Sinha, Calcutta

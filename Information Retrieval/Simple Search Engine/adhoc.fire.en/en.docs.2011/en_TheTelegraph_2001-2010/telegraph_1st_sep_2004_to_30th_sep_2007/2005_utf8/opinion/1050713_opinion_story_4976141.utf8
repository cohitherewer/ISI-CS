 Letters to Editor

 No changes, please

 Sir ? The Part I undergraduate examinations of the Calcutta University are finally over, after a month-and-a-half (BSc students still have two weeks of practicals left though). If this epic time-span for examinations does not sound incredible enough, take into account the fact that students write their papers for an astounding 38 hours. The CU, moreover, still prefers long, elaborate answers. So the more pages you consume, the better. While other universities now conduct weekly tests and have brief 50-mark exams, the CU format remains the same. There is no scope for any independent thinking either. A student of literature, for example, will be expected to regurgitate whatever his professor has taught or a renowned critic has already thought. In most well-known universities this would qualify for ?plagiarism?. Not so in our dear old CU, where everything must remain as it is.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sarit Ray, Calcutta

 Cry freedom

 Sir ? It is curious to hear a staunch Marxist like Ashok Mitra speaking against an American action which supposedly compromises India?s suzerainty (?A world of anomalies?, July 8). As far as I know, the leftists are the most prominent proponents of supra-national allegiances, almost like the Islamic fundamentalists. Once it was the Soviet Union, now it is China ? they must do all it takes to secure the larger socialist interests. Now one of these pseudo-patriots tells us that India?s national security also matters. 

 Mitra?s fallacies must be put to rest. First, American customs officials are only checking goods bound for the United States of America, and they will be doing this in other countries. How does this violate the national security of India alone? A sovereign country has every right to monitor goods entering its borders. Mitra can in no way be sure that these officials will dictate terms to our own customs officials. His argument here borders on speculation. Second, there is nothing new in the fact that American and British secret services operate throughout the world. Mitra seems to yearn for a world where power politics will have no role and no state will intercept the moves of any other. Is this not idyllic? Does Mitra know how and where our Research and Analysis Wing operates? 

 Third, the case of Cuba presents an interesting irony. Fidel Castro?s was a socialist experiment that has produced a Cuba which is neither militarily nor economically strong enough to stop the US from building a Guantanamo on its territory. Mitra actually provides no solution for countries like India which are in a flux and have to balance their national interests with maintaining a healthy relationship with the US. Would Mitra want India to go the same way that ?dissenting? powers like North Korea, Iraq and the former Soviet Union have gone? 

 Yours faithfully,

Aruni Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? After going through Ashok Mitra?s ?A world of anomalies? one is left pondering the consequences of our ?strategic partnership? with the US for combating global terrorism. So far India has been fairly successful in projecting a neutral image. Why has it suddenly given that up to curry favour with the US? This would definitely attract the wrath of anti-US organizations like al Qaida. The series of blasts that rocked the heart of London on the morning of July 7 serves as a tragic reminder of the effects that the developing Indo-US relationship will have on our lives.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Jaydeep Chakraborty, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Animal-lovers of the world, rejoice! India has finally gone to the dogs. If Ashok Mitra is to be believed, American immigration officers will soon move into Indian ports to bully Indian officials and dog Indian citizens who already lead a dog?s life. But when Americans hop around the world looking for ?irregular combatants? isn?t it another kind of terrorism? 

 Yours faithfully,

R.Sen, Calcutta

 Sir ? I was flummoxed reading about the possibility of US immigration officials moving into Indian ports. How could a sovereign state and a mature democracy like India even think of compromising its hard-earned freedom? It is painful when one comes to think of the cost our forefathers had to pay for this freedom. And it all seems to be happening stealthily. Manmohan Singh, one can have no doubt, is an economist of the finest order, but he definitely lacks the ability to gauge the patriotic feelings of the people of this country. This is a matter of national pride and much more important than national security.

 Another question. What are the left and the right parties doing about this complete surrender of authority?

 Yours faithfully,

Swarup Som, Tokyo

 Sir ? How can India have any truck with the US which, as Pranab Mukherjee recently pointed out, is ?not a reliable partner?. The US?s double standards in dealing with terrorism is clear from its supply of arms to Pakistan, which has been instrumental in keeping extremism alive in Kashmir. India has never had anything more than a working relationship with the US. If the US now appears to be willing to ?listen? to India it is because this is its way of limiting China in south Asia. Let not India become another US stooge, a role it has refused to play so far.

 Yours faithfully,

 Ratan Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 PUBLIC DEBATE ON PRIVACY

 Sanjay Banerjee

 The baazee.com incident, and the one involving Kareena Kapoor and her male companion, pose vital questions already forgotten by the media ? the right of privacy, freedom of expression and the archaic Indian laws on public decency and morality. The Indian social system is hypocritical and the legal system completely out of date. The rampant censorship based on so-called religious sensitivity is no different from the censorship of the church in England during the Middle Ages. 

 This dogmatic censorship in India is aiding religious institutions to foment a communal dictatorship. And these religious sentiments are being supplemented by a false pride in the so-called Indian culture, allowing fanatics and murderers to multiply in the highest religious offices. 

 Till recently, the United Kingdom was a perfect example of how the freedom of expression could be used against church hypocrisies and political injustice. One could criticize everything and everyone ? the queen, the prime minister (who is the worst affected), actors, presenters, handicapped people, the religious institutions. The targets invariably react in a much-civilized fashion. 

 America lacks this basic ability to appreciate criticism, and the Anglican Church is partly to blame for that. It is this conservatism that forced Chris Savido to bring down his portrait of Bush Monkeys from a New York exhibition, although some Americans were daring enough to put it up on giant billboards in Manhattan.

 Our own watchdog

 Pramod Mahajan is believed to have said in the context of the Kareena episode that we cannot perform in the living room what we do in the toilet. Granted. But the assumption behind this is that if censorship is relaxed, people will start fornicating in public squares. If that were true, think of what would have happened in some of the Western nations. 

 The problem with India is that the public has been exposed to tasteless entertainment for so long that any move to relax censorship is viewed as a move to encourage the showing of cleavages. Only a responsible media that will be allowed to expose the hypocrisy of the present society can help. 

 The media in Britain has become the watchdog of society. In India, we need to create such a media. But this cannot happen if the media remains perpetually on the side of the establishment. It also cannot happen if the performing arts continue to be gagged. For it is through the creative medium that dissent has to be voiced. It is because the performing arts are so crucial that the clamp down on Behzti in Birmingham comes as a shock.

 Holding out

 The baazee.com issue is much more serious than it appears. It is not just a question of laws concerning information technology. When such matters boil down to endangering the right to privacy or the freedom of expression, they invite a public debate, especially since the laws concerning such matters need a revision anyway and public awareness is almost nil. But if the Indian people continue to prefer indifference to change, it is going to be a difficult situation.

 What is the saddest part is the attitude of the youth ? to privacy and to the freedom of expression ? which, it goes without saying, lies at the bottom of the controversy. Sadly enough, the youth who should be replacing outdated and redundant ideas, seem to be succumbing to the luxury of the globalized world without weighing the pros and cons. Yet without such reflection it is impossible to usher in a more tolerant, prosperous and acceptable society which retains its own in the face of a capricious foreign culture.

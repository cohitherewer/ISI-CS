 Letters to Editor

 Lessons in humanity

 Sir ? Silpa Jagu?s dying wish to donate her eyes to another victim of militant blasts like her was very touching (?Teenager gifts sight in death? Jan 20, North-east edition). In a state where extremists continue to train their guns on soft targets and where the people are still trying to come to terms with the possibility of losing their near and dear ones every day, it is heartening to learn that human qualities have not died out. Silpa has shown us the virtues of humanity and what one can offer to another even when all seems lost.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Utpal Borpatragohain, Dibrugarh

 Sorry state

 Sir ? Apart from the usual contract killings, extortion, caste conflicts, looting and murder, kidnapping for ransom has become a flourishing industry in Bihar, election time or not. The abduction of Kislay Kaushal, the Class IX student of Delhi Public School in Patna, is another disgraceful addition to Bihar?s reputation as an unsafe and mafia-ruled state (?Bihar children on warpath over kidnap?, Jan 25). 

 It is appalling that the schoolchildren who went to the airport to meet the Rashtriya Janata Dal leader, Laloo Prasad Yadav, were cold-shouldered by him. Laloo Yadav?s attitude towards them would perhaps have been dramatically different had they been a part of the Bihar electorate. There is a lesson to be learnt from the schoolchildren who have realized that the Bihar police will be of little help to them, and have resorted to fasting, praying and organizing yagnas for Kislay?s safe return. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? It will hardly be surprising if Kislay Kaushal?s kidnapping is now given a political twist, just before the assembly elections in the state. One wonders why Laloo Yadav is so aloof about the whole incident. His attitude reflects the person he is ? a completely insincere man who uses his empty rhetoric to his full advantage. He should consider handing over the case to the Centre if the Bihar police are so inept that they remain clueless even after a week of Kislay?s kidnapping.

 Yours faithfully,

Md. Mudassir Ala, Kishanganj, Bihar

 Sir ? I am depressed with the way students in Patna are protesting the kidnapping of Kislay Kaushal. It is almost certain that boycotting classes will do little to bring back their friend safely. Rather, this may inculcate in them the strike culture that has so plagued our country. It would be a better idea for the students to keep praying for Kislay without locking horns with the administration.

 Yours faithfully, 

Siddhartha Raj Guha, Jabalpur

 Sir ? It is now obvious that Bihar considers the preparations for the forthcoming assembly elections more important than doing something about a schoolboy?s kidnapping. Laloo Prasad Yadav need not have been so unsympathetic as to comment that the protest of the students at the airport was planted by a news channel. Why are the state authorities not sparing a thought for the poor boy and the plight of his parents? 

 Yours faithfully, 

Rasmita Rath, Cuttack

 Unable to connect

 Sir ? I purchased an India Telephone Card from the Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited?s office at Burdwan for Rs 100 and activated it on January 16. But every time I try to use the card, I hear a recorded message that tells me that I have exceeded the time limit for entering a valid number. I have heard that this problem exists in Calcutta too. Will BSNL please look into the matter?

 Yours faithfully,

Mousumi Dikpati, Burdwan

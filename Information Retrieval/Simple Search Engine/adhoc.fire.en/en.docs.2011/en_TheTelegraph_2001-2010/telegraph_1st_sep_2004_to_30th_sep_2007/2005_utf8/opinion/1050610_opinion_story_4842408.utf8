 Letters to Editor

 Too late to be sorry

 Sir ? One cannot really blame Edson Cholbi Nascimento, Edinho to Santos fans, for dappling with drugs (?Pele rues being in the dark?, June 9). After all, having to live one?s life under the shadow of an illustrious father had become an ordeal for Edinho, especially since he had little to show for his footballing skills. But surely Edinho could have thought about a better way to earn his two minutes of fame. Hobnobbing with drug traffickers would not exactly make his father a proud man. One also needs to tell Pele that he is equally responsible for his son?s wayward ways. This is not the first time that Edinho found himself on the wrong side of the law; remember how he how was booked for homicide earlier? Had Pele ensured that his son mended his ways earlier, then he wouldn?t have to shed copious tears now that the horse has bolted.

 Yours faithfully,

 Shubhojit Biswas, Calcutta 

 More than words

 Sir ? Lal Krishna Advani has done nothing to deserve the ill treatment meted out to him by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, which has berated the veteran leader for calling Mohammad Ali Jinnah a secular man (?Jinnah praise turns fatal?, June 8). However, had the VHP leaders cared to check the contents of Advani?s speech at Karachi, they would have understood that he simply wanted to further the cause of friendship between India and Pakistan. Issues such as Jinnah?s secular credentials were farthest from Advani?s mind at the time. Perhaps, someone needs to tell the sangh parivar leaders that the days of communal politics are over and they should make way for more moderate faces. The criticisms against Advani are likely to cost the parivar dear. Worse, the sangh leaders seem to have forgotten that they owe a lot to leaders like Advani for the political clout that they wield today. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sarbani Dutta Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? A lot has been written about Advani describing Jinnah as a secular man. But none of the articles have mentioned the fact that the Partition of India could have been avoided if Jinnah, and not Nehru, was offered the post of prime minister after independence. The machinations of some Congressmen and Nehru prevented Jinnah from becoming the first prime minister of independent India. Although Jinnah and Nehru shared comparable views and had a similar upbringing, Jinnah was the more intelligent of the two. Had he become the prime minister, India would not have been dismembered, with the creation of Pakistan first, and Bangladesh later. Instead, a few politicians with petty self-interests took over the reigns of the country leading it to ruins soon after independence.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Ramakrishnan, Calcutta

 Sir ? Politicians use the word ?secular? to praise or malign others in the trade often without understanding the real meaning of the term. A secular person is one who does not advocate or profess any particular religion while a secular society allows all religions to flourish, without discriminating against the members of any particular faith. Unfortunately, most of the politicians in India are not secular in the true sense of the word. They have often singled out minorities like Dalits and Muslims, discriminated against them, only to woo them at the time of elections.

 By the same logic, Jinnah cannot be called a secular man simply because he divided India on religious lines, and created a separate state for Muslims by telling them that they would not be adequately represented in a Hindu-dominated India. If Jinnah were secular, he would not have espoused his ?Two- nation theory?. Instead, he would have argued that one set of laws is good enough for everybody, irrespective of caste, creed or religion. Regrettably, our politicians are still following the path shown by Jinnah, without realizing that such a strategy impairs the integrity of the nation by alienating Muslims from the social mainstream. 

 Religion is a matter of individual choice. In a secular society such as ours, one should be free to profess or convert to any religion of one?s choice. Yet, most crimes taking place today is committed in the name of religion. 

 Yours faithfully

 Sir ? The ruckus created by the sangh parivar regarding Advani?s praise of Jinnah only goes to show that the outfit is intent on making a mountain out of a molehill. Advani?s trip to Pakistan was more of a personal visit, and not an official one. Instead of using this event as a platform to strengthen the fledgling Indo-Pak peace process, the sangh parivar seems to be more interested in frittering away the gains made during the talks held between the two countries by their rantings against both Advani and Jinnah.

 Yours faithfully,

R. Sekar, Angul, Orissa

 Sir ? Was Advani finally confessing that Jinnah ? who singlehandedly made the British carve out a Muslim nation from undivided India ? is his role model (in the sangh?s mission of making India a Hindu rashtra)?

 Yours faithfully,

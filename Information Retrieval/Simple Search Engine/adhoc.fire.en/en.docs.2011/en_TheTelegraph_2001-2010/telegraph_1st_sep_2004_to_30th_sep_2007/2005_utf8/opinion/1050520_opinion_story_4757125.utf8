 Paperback Pickings

 Young authors and reformers

 the light 

 of asia (Penguin, Rs 195) by Edwin Arnold 

 is the reprint of an eight-book poetical rendering of the 

 life of the Buddha, first published in 1879. Educated in 

 Britain, Arnold (1832-1904) became a schoolmaster and came 

 to India as principal of the Government Sanskrit College 

 at Poona, a post he held during the 1857 uprising. He describes 

 himself, in the preface, as ?a man who loved India and the 

 Indian peoples?: ?In the following poem I have sought, by 

 the medium of an imaginary Buddhist votary, to depict the 

 life and character and indicate the philosophy of that noble 

 hero and reformer, Prince Gautama of India, the founder 

 of Buddhism.? Arnold also wrote a life of Christ in verse.

 post 

 box no. 99 and other stories (Rupa, Rs 50) 

 edited by Ruskin Bond is an exhilarating collection 

 of really short stories written by Indian students in their 

 late teens. These are the 12 prize-winning stories from 

 the Classmate Young Author Contest 2004, in which over 40,000 

 students from 2,000 schools spread over 12 cities took part. 

 The writing is, in most cases, remarkably fresh, committed 

 and original, and an added pleasure is to read the varied 

 profiles of the 12 writers. Their reading habits are a bit 

 alarming though, many preferring writers like Paul Coelho, 

 Richard Bach and Ayn Rand. ?Post Box No. 99? is a fine story 

 on the Partition by Jyoti Iyer, which won the main prize. 

 But the collection errs on the side of an unnecessary competitiveness 

 by mentioning, in each of the author profiles, how the stories 

 were ranked in the contest. Debi Talukdar?s ?A Bald Man?s 

 Comb? and Jeevan Austin?s ?A Precious Memory? are also excellent.

 Rammohun: 

 a study (Blue Pencil, Rs 275) by Nirmalya 

 Bagchi is Kalyan Kumar Das?s translation of a valuable 

 piece of historical research done originally in Bengali, 

 Rammohun Charcha. Bagchi?s Rammohun is a controversial 

 character who ?actualises his age?. Rammohun?s age was one 

 of revolution and reform, and there are important chapters 

 in this monograph on education, the emancipation of women, 

 sati, agrarian issues, and on Rammohun?s relationship 

 with Derozio and the Derozians, Robert Owen, Ireland and 

 Islam. The appendices gather relevant excerpts from Owen, 

 Crabbe Robinson?s diary, and Macaulay?s letters.

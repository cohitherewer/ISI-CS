 - Modi may give the ultimate twist to the Vajpayee-Advani relationship

 The duel between former Prime Minister 

Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Lal Krishna Advani is not quite over as yet.

 AWESOME TWOSOME: Lal Krishna Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee

 The 150-minute flight from Delhi to Chennai could have been just the place for thrashing out some old ghosts. But Lal Krishna Advani decided to take an early morning flight to the southern Indian city on Friday, while his old friend and former boss, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, opted for the 10.15 flight. Not because, party men hasten to add, the two leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) didnt want to travel together, but because Vajpayees health problems forced him to take a day flight. 

 Vajpayee had called party general secretary Pramod Mahajan earlier this week and urged him to delay the start of the BJP national executive meeting in Chennai by a couple of hours. My health doesnt allow me to spend an extra night in Chennai or take an early morning flight, he told Mahajan. The meeting was accordingly rescheduled. 

 The two BJP leaders seldom travel together, of course. Still, there were some in the BJP who had hoped that the leaders would amicably sort out their differences before reaching Chennai. For even though Advani called on Vajpayee at his residence on Tuesday, a no-holds-barred discussion among the clouds would have helped clear the air. Everybody has done something that they shouldnt have done, says Pramod Mahajan enigmatically. Everybody has played a no-ball, he says. 

 And even as the Chennai meeting winds up today, whats clear is that all is still not well between Vajpayee, veteran party leader and former Prime Minister, and Advani, at present party president and former deputy prime minister. Though the two leaders have called a temporary truce, their relationship ? always a subject of speculation ? shows alarming fissures. Worse, the Madanlal Khurana episode of last week indicates that the cracks are now out in the open. And Khurana may be just a trigger, says a party insider. 

 At loggerheads

 Last week, Advani expelled former Delhi chief minister Khurana, who had been openly attacking the party president for a while now. The expulsion irked Vajpayee ? who has known Khurana possibly even longer than hes known Advani. BJP sources point out that Vajpayee had earlier urged Advani not to take a hasty step on Khurana, and Advani supporters stress that Khuranas imminent expulsion had been conveyed to Vajpayee days in advance. But, in what political observers thought was a significant move, Vajpayee actually issued a written statement in favour of Khurana and against his expulsion. A face-saving script was hastily penned over the weekend, and on Monday, Khuranas expulsion was revoked after he expressed his regrets. 

 But the Advani-Vajpayee saga, many in the party and its parent organisation, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) believe, is far from over. For Vajpayee, who has been seeking to oust Narendra Modi from Gujarat since the 2002 anti-Muslim violence, the chief minister may be next on the agenda. Some in the Sangh parivar believe that Khurana was just a tester, and Modi is the real target. I tend to agree (with the perception) that the real issue here is Modi, says a party insider close to Vajpayee. 

 At stake, clearly, is the future of the Gujarat chief minister. Modi, who has been a bone of contention between the two BJP leaders ever since Gujarat burst into flames in February, 2002, is widely seen as a man who enjoys the protection of Advani. When Vajpayee wanted Modi out, it was Advani and his young lieutenants who stood up for Modi. And in July, when Advani was being attacked for his comments on Jinnah in Pakistan, the Gujarat chief minister repaid an old debt by supporting him. 

 Turning point

 After Chennai, many believe that the Modi issue will emerge as a serious irritant. And that is why the Khurana incident is important, says a party insider. At another point of time, it would have been just an incident. But the present context ? of serious dissent and internal bickerings ? is significant, he says. 

 Clearly, many in the party believe that Modi may give the ultimate twist to the Vajpayee-Advani relationship. And for an association that goes back 50 years, that may well be the turning point. 

 A poster-sized sepia-tinted photograph that a former Advani aide keeps carefully ensconced in a bubble wrap showcases the start of the relationship between the two party stalwarts. The picture, shot at Kota in Rajasthan in 1952, has a young Advani standing behind a seated Vajpayee. Advani looks nervous; Vajpayee is smiling. 

 For Advani, Vajpayee was a leader years before he himself earned the sobriquet. Advani was an RSS pracharak in Rajasthan when he met Vajpayee, who was already making a name for himself as a leader of the Jan Sangh, the precursor of the BJP. After he moved to Delhi, Advani used to sit in the front office of the official bungalow of Vijay Kumar Malhotra, then with the Delhi Municipal Corporation (DMC). Advani was an ordinary-looking man: about 40-ish, and wearing round, Gandhi glasses, says an RSS leader. 

 The RSS leader holds that it was at a meeting at Malhotras house that Advanis political career first took shape. Malhotra was sitting there with another old Delhi hand, Kidarnath Sahni, and Khurana, drawing up a list of names for a DMC alderman. What about this young man? asked Sahni, pointing to Advani. He speaks good English. 

 Shared history

 That was just the beginning. Advani became the parliamentary secretary of Vajpayee, who had made quite a name for himself in and out of Parliament. But for Advani ? who was to make his political mark only after the Emergency ? Vajpayee was always the leader. Those were the days when Vajpayee, one of the few who got an official car from the Jan Sangh, was chauffeured around in his white Ambassador driven by an old faithful called Birju. Advani, on the other hand, was driving his own, green Fiat ? registered DHC 1. There were the occasional outings ? watching Hindi films together and eating the occasional plate of chaat. But, even then, they were always markedly different in their thinking, says an old BJP watcher. 

 But, clearly, the two leaders had a shared history. Advani has often spoken to his friends about a despondent day, sometime in 1958, when he and Vajpayee were wondering what to do with their time after a particularly bad performance by the Jan Sangh in the DMC. The two decided to go see a film. The choice was the Raj Kapoor-Mala Sinha starrer, Phir Subah Hogi. Legend has it that by the time the film ended, the two leaders were hopeful about the Jan Sanghs return. 

 It was, actually, the return of the BJP that brought about a change in their fortunes ? and pitted the two leaders against each other. From two Lok Sabha seats in 1984 ? after Indira Gandhis assassination ? to heading a coalition government, the BJP moved on. And while it was Advani who consolidated the party in the late Eighties, leading the Ayodhya movement, it was Vajpayees acceptability ? cutting across linguistic, political or regional divides ? that led to the partys growth from 1996 to 1998, says a party insider. 

 That was ironical, for after the successful Ayodhya movement ? which Advani steered and Vajpayee privately disapproved of ? Vajpayee had more or less packed his bags for early retirement. But, party observers stress, the RSS realised the important role that Vajpayee could play once it concluded that the BJP could only come to power in a coalition government. So in November 1995, Advani proposed his name as a would-be Prime Minister at a BJP conclave in Mumbai. 

 Most party insiders believe that the two leaders came closer to each other while in government, even as their differences sharpened. There was a lot of interaction, with Vajpayee and his family often dropping in at Advanis for an impromptu meal. They watched movies together, and religiously went to each others house every Holi. On most matters of governance, there was accord. If Advani wanted a particular appointee as a governor, Vajpayee did not ask questions. If Vajpayee had a candidate in mind, he let Advani know. Traditionally, they have a good working relationship, says party general secretary Arun Jaitley. 

 Future tense

 On several major issues, however, there was discord. The then Prime Ministers Office (PMO) was keen to work out a solution to the Ayodhya problem, and is said to have reached a near settlement when it met with opposition from some of the more strident members of the Sangh Parivar. Many in the PMO held Advani responsible for the failed resolution of the Agra summit ? the July 2001 meeting between General Pervez Musharraf and Vajpayee. And on Gujarat, again, the then PMOs views found little support from Advani. But, in his own way, Vajpayee said what he wanted to when, in his very first visit to Gujarat after the violence, he urged Modi to follow Raj Dharma ? or the ethics of a ruler, says a former member of the Vajpayee-led government. 

 Four years later, Modi is back as an issue. But, for Vajpayee, the situation in 2005 is not the same as it was in 2001. For one, Vajpayee ? now out of government and his partys organisational hierarchy ? has nothing to lose in calling for Modis removal. Two, dissidents in Gujarat have been upping the campaign against the chief minister and have been petitioning Vajpayee to intervene. And third, Advani no longer enjoys the full support of party leaders and the RSS. 

 Two months ago, when Advani found himself pushed to the wall after his remarks on Jinnah, with his hand-picked and carefully-nurtured second rung turning its back on him, it was Vajpayee who defended him. Vajpayee has never seen Advani this vulnerable. And Advani may never have witnessed a Vajpayee this unequivocal. 

 Clearly, round one has gone to Vajpayee. And the arena is being cleared for the next bout.

 On July 30, the Daily News 

 and Analysis (DNA) office in Mumbais central 

 business area of Worli had an unexpected visitor ? Samir 

 Jain, managing director of Bennett, Coleman amp; Co. Ltd. 

 The boss of Indias largest print media company, which 

 publishes The Times of India (TOI) and other 

 newspapers and magazines, had dropped in to congratulate 

 DNA staff on the launch of the new newspaper. DNA 

 editor Gautam Adhikari took Jain and his entourage of 

 senior managers around the newsroom. It was nice of 

 him to come to our office on the day we came out with the 

 paper. We thank him for that, says Sudhir Agarwal, 

 managing director of the Rs 1,800 crore Dainik Bhaskar group, 

 which has launched DNA in a 50:50 partnership with 

 Subhash Chandras Zee group. 

 But such bonhomie did not quite 

 mask the intense war that has been on in Indias commercial 

 capital for the last few weeks. In three months, as many 

 new newspapers have been launched ? DNA, The Hindustan 

 Times which launched a Mumbai edition in mid-June and 

 Mumbai Mirror, a tabloid kicked off by Bennett, Coleman. 

 Mumbai, which had four general dailies and four financial 

 dailies, now has a tally of seven general newspapers and 

 four financial dailies.

 Sample this too, to see how intense 

 the war is ? DNA wants to pay TOI back in 

 its own coin. We want to do in Mumbai what they have 

 done elsewhere, Agarwal declares. Essentially, that 

 means cutting cover prices. DNA is being sold at 

 half of TOIs cover price. Others too 

 are taking potshots at rivals. Vir Sanghvi, editorial director 

 of The Hindustan Times, dismisses DNA as a 

 tired retread of TOIs ideas produced by ex-TOI 

 people which he says is not half as good as TOI. 

 Adhikari says DNA wants to be different, but 

 not radically different from The Times. 

 He discounts The Hindustan Times Salman Khan tape 

 story that appeared when the paper was launched in the city: 

 Its a magazine type story. If such a strategy 

 worked, The Indian Express would be the number one 

 paper in Mumbai.

 The reason newspapers are jousting 

 for a piece of Mumbais action is obvious ? the citys 

 print media rake in an estimated advertising revenue of 

 Rs 1,300 crore a year, more than half of it accounted for 

 by The Times alone.

 The first round

 To be sure, media watchers argue 

 that Mumbai has long been an under-exploited market, dominated 

 by TOI with a weak number two, a position claimed 

 by both the Express and The Asian Age. This 

 is not counting afternoon tabloid Mid-Day (daily 

 circulation: some 1.60 lakh copies) which has so far been 

 the principal challenger to TOI. According to a National 

 Readership Survey, 57 lakh people can read and write English 

 in Mumbai, versus nearly 37 lakh in Delhi. But the combined 

 circulation of English language newspapers in Mumbai is 

 under 9 lakh; in Delhi, the figure is close to 17 lakh, 

 according to Lakshmi Narasimhan, national director (central 

 trading group) of GroupM, one of the countrys biggest 

 media buyers. Mumbai has a huge potential for English 

 language newspapers, he says. Girish Agarwal, marketing 

 director of the Dainik Bhaskar group, adds that Mumbai can 

 absorb nearly a million new readers. This is the reason 

 we have come in, he declares. 

 Significantly, Mumbais media 

 war wont be confined to the metropolis ? it will quickly 

 spill over to New Delhi. Last month, DNA acquired 

 a 10-acre plot in Greater Noida, where it plans to put up 

 a press and office soon. DNA hopes to launch editions 

 in all four metropolitan cities. But we plan to do 

 it fast in Delhi, reveals Sudhir Agarwal. 

 So whos winning the first 

 round of this war in Mumbai? TOI clearly has remained 

 way ahead, though each newspaper insists that it is going 

 great guns. Sudhir Agarwal says that within a week of its 

 launch, DNA added some 24,000 copies (according to 

 Agarwal the current print order is 2.97 lakh). Sanghvi says 

 his own target was in excess of one lakh copies when the 

 paper was launched on June 14 and that he was startled 

 when the paper took off so quickly. Bhaskar Das, executive 

 president at Bennett, Coleman, says The Times circulation 

 has been steadily rising for the last couple of months. 

 The rise in circulation is partly due to the fact that buyers 

 of the daily now get a complementary copy of Mumbai Mirror, 

 he adds. Mumbais newspaper war is being fought on 

 several fronts: 

 Through alliances: 

 The Hindustan Times and 

 TOI closed ranks against DNA, agreed to run 

 each others advertisements, not to poach each others 

 staff (Sanghvi denies that any non-poaching agreement exists) 

 and to print Mumbai Mirror and The Economic Times 

 at The Hindustan Times press. The agreement, Girish 

 Agarwal points out, indicates that DNA is the 

 common enemy. Indeed, DNA is widely perceived 

 as being a bigger threat to English language newspaper groups 

 because of its deep war chest (the Agarwals told a journalist 

 that theyre ready to spend hundreds of crores of rupees 

 in Mumbai) and its national plans. 

 Through editorial content and 

 the number of pages:

 The Times has significantly 

 expanded news coverage. The paper has two sections, The 

 Times of India and Times International, which 

 includes Bombay Times, the city supplement. It also 

 introduced supplements on health, trend, science and technology. 

 Unquestionably, DNA fell short editorially of the 

 expectations aroused by its multi-crore rupee high decibel 

 advertising campaign, though it has been improving since 

 then. The Hindustan Times, on the other hand, is 

 slickly produced, better designed and uses better newsprint. 

 It launched with a bang with a report on the Salman Khan 

 tape. 

 The war has also spawned the bulky, 

 40 plus-page newspaper. DNA offers 44 pages a day, 

 The Hindustan Times has, on an average, 40 pages 

 and TOI has raised its page count from 32 to 48. 

 The basic idea here is to occupy the readers mind 

 fully so that he wont look at other newspapers, never 

 mind that Mumbais busy public wont have time 

 for this information overload. 

 Circulation and distribution: 

 These are the other facets of 

 this war. DNA and The Hindustan Times claim 

 an average Mumbai circulation of 2.90 lakh and 2 lakh copies, 

 respectively. TOI leads with some 5.23 lakh buyers 

 (Audit Bureau of Circulation figures from July-Dec 2004) 

 in greater Mumbai. Bennett, Coleman executives say that 

 circulation in greater Mumbai is now 6 lakh. Bennett, Coleman 

 claims daily news stand sales of about 60,000 for Mumbai 

 Mirror. 

 Predictably, rivals are quick 

 to dismiss the circulation figures of other newspapers. 

 Says a senior source at The Hindustan Times: Our 

 estimate is that DNAs circulation is at best 

 one lakh, excluding the huge samplings that are given away 

 free. A Bennett, Coleman source says that while 90,000 

 copies of DNA are being sold every day, the figure 

 for The Hindustan Times is 70,000 copies. It is difficult 

 to assess the veracity of such claims because the Audit 

 Bureau of Circulation does not audit the newcomers to Mumbai. 

 Exasperated by rumours that DNA is not faring well, 

 Sudhir Agarwal says that DNA will offer a green 

 card to journalists, ad agency and marketing executives 

 to visit its press from August 22. You can check our 

 newsprint stock, see for yourself the number of papers being 

 printed and loaded for distribution, Agarwal says. 

 Strikingly, nearly all newspaper 

 companies have hit the subscription trail to ramp up their 

 circulation numbers. Subscriptions are common in the newspaper 

 business but in Mumbai many are buying readership by offering 

 substantial discounts on the cover price. Subscribers to 

 The Hindustan Times for a year get the paper for 

 96 paise a day (the invitation cover price is 

 Rs 2.50) ? and subscriptions account for half the newspapers 

 circulation in Mumbai, according to a senior source in the 

 paper. DNA is not offering a discount directly. Before 

 the paper was launched, it had said that its cover price 

 would be Rs 4. It offered subscribers an introductory price 

 of Rs 2 for six months. Subscribers were entitled to privileges 

 such as discounts on movie tickets and on other products.

 Such discounts and low cover prices 

 carry a financial cost. Every issue of DNA, for example, 

 costs Rs 12 to produce, Sudhir Agarwal acknowledges. Even 

 if the paper recovers Rs 2 from the cover price (advertisement 

 revenue is nothing to write home about at the moment), the 

 paper will incur a loss of roughly Rs 8. Seven crore a month 

 or over Rs 100 crore in a year.

 On the distribution front, Diligent 

 Media Corporation, the joint venture company that owns DNA, 

 negotiated directly with newspaper vendors, bypassing the 

 citys eight major distributors. While two of them, 

 K.B. Sons Pvt. Ltd and Orbit Marketing Pvt. Ltd, work almost 

 exclusively for The Times group, The Hindustan 

 Times signed on Dangat Newspaper Agency for distribution. 

 The competition is hitting Bennett, Coleman in one sense. 

 They never took back unsold copies from hawkers, but 

 they are now beginning to do so, points out Prem Shukla, 

 executive editor of the Dophar Ka Saamana, published 

 by the Shiv Sena which controls the hawkers union, 

 Vartaman Patra Vikreta Sena. 

 Poaching: 

 Long before its rivals launched 

 in Mumbai, TOI raided journalists from other newspapers 

 in the city. DNA poached 30-35 marketing people from 

 Bennett, Coleman, offering some 100 per cent salary increases. 

 Bennett, Coleman jacked up the salaries of 20 per cent of 

 its staff by 40 to 50 per cent. A senior editor of The 

 Times says that he spent more than 200 hours persuading 

 journalists to stay back. 

 Advertising: 

 Its too early for the newcomers 

 to Mumbai to garner much local advertising as yet. Most 

 major advertisers would rather wait and watch. Advertising 

 agency executives also gleefully point out that with The 

 Hindustan Times and DNA beginning to sell ad 

 space at a discount, The Times too will become flexible 

 on ad rates. At present, a black and white ad in TOI 

 costs Rs 1,500 per sq cm versus Rs 640 in DNA.

 Looking ahead

 Meanwhile, the big question is: 

 will their bigger brethren now squeeze out Indian Express 

 and The Asian Age? P.K. Iyer, executive director 

 at the Hyderabad-based Deccan Chronicle Holdings Ltd, which 

 controls The Asian Age, says the company is putting 

 up a press in Mumbai to increase circulation from some 50,000 

 to 1,50,000. It will happen in October when our press 

 is ready. We are certain the Mumbai market will expand and 

 accommodate even niche players like us, Iyer says. 

 Several phone calls to Indian Express chief editor 

 Shekhar Gupta for comments elicited no response.

 Clearly, only the first shots 

 in a long drawn out war have been fired. Watch this space 

 for the action ahead.

 Letters to Editor

 Life on campus

 Sir ? Paedophile on IIT campus? (March 4) may have shocked many. Sex in educational institutions is associared with young love or, increasingly nowadays, with harassment of women students by teachers or male peers. The child-molester is hardly ever thought of, especially on campus. Yet the paedophile is a lurking and frigteningly normal presence among us, as recent exposures suggest. The conspiracy of silence that surrounds child abuse allows us to be surprised that researchers may prey on durwans? children. 

 Yours faithfully,

M. Moitra, Calcutta

 War of images

 Sir ? There has been a spate of suicides among teenagers over the last few days. Most of the incidents followed after the victims were rebuked by their parents for watching television. The tug-of-war between parents and children over television-viewing is common occurrence, and now, one knows, even deadly. However, we can neither blame the parents nor the children for the problem. One way out of the impasse could be to appeal to television programmers to see that their programmes in the end have some educational value to impart instead of providing baseless entertainment. They cannot remain unconcerned about the welfare of the student community. 

Yours faithfully, 

Moli Bhowmick, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The children of the 21st century seem to be more sentimental than ever before. Television has made them lazy and selfish seekers of pleasure. Entertainment has priority over education. If parents reprimand them for their addiction to cable television, they react unreasonably, some even think of ending their lives, as Susmita Das and Mohua Roy have done (?Teen toll up in TV tug-of-war?, Feb 26). A vast majority of urban parents are in the same position as the parents of these girls. The tension is ruining the relationship between parents and children. Instead of berating parents for being unable to handle the situation, sociologists and scholars should direct their attack at the cable invasion.

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? Successive reports on teenage suicides have come as a shock. What is forcing the children to take such an extreme step? In the case of Mohua Roy, the girl was chided for watching television despite failing to do well in her examinations. But why was she not stopped from spending too much time before the television earlier? Why did her parents not try to convince her about the rightness or wrongness of her actions? Had they done so, would the child have taken such an unfortunate decision? Mohua never learnt the value or the meaning of life. 

 Parents merely want their children to grow into healthy individuals, get their education from a reputed institution and to establish themselves in life. But parental duty cannot be restricted to that. Parents today should realize that their children are growing up in a very demanding age. They have to be given the attention they deserve and demand. Parents have to converse with their children, give them time. If they realize that their children are going in the wrong direction, they have to try to regain their confidence and be friends with them. In other words, the answer to the problem does not lie in wielding the rod.

Yours faithfully, 

Shameek Bose, Calcutta 

 Sir ? If parents want their children to act responsibly, they have to set a precedent. When parents try to discipline their children for unregulated hours of television-viewing, they have to ask themselves if they aren?t doing the same thing themselves.

 Yours faithfully,

J. Chatterjee, Calcutta

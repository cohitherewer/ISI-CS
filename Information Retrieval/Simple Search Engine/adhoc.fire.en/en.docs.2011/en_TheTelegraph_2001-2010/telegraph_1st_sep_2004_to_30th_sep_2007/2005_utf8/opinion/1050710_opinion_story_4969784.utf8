 Sena VS Sena

 - As long as Uddhav leads, the party has no future: Rane

 Narayan Ranes revolt is the latest in a series of blows to have hit the once powerful party. 

 Thackerays outfit is now on the backfoot. 

 Bishakha De Sarkar reports 

 THE WARRIORS: (from 

 top): Narayan Rane; Balasaheb Thackeray; his nephew 

 Raj and son Uddhav 

 Uddhav Thackeray was back in Mumbai after a holiday in the United States, but still cocooned at home. There were tell-tale signs of rebellion in the Shiv Sena, and workers and leaders were whispering about the likely exit of a boss. But the partys working president was incommunicado.

 Where is your boss? Hasnt he returned from the US, an old acquaintance asked a Sena leader last month. Yes, the Sena leader replied, Junior Thackeray was back in the city. But for the last seven or eight days since his return, all that he has been doing is going through the photographs he clicked while on vacation.

 Quite like a modern-day Nero, the old student of the J.J. School of Art sat surrounded by pictures at Matoshree, the Thackerays bungalow in suburban Mumbai, as the Sena came apart. The party that his father, Balasaheb Thackeray, started in 1966 and handed over to the youngest of his three sons two years ago, was once a well-knit body. Today, it has started to unravel. This is the beginning of the Senas disintegration, says Vaibhav Purandare, journalist and author of The Sena Story.

 The Sena started coming apart at the seams when Balasahebs nephew, Raj Thackeray, was sidelined to make way for Uddhav. But, last Sunday, when Thackeray expelled his old lieutenant and former strongman, Narayan Tatu Rane, many thought that it was the beginning of the end of the road for the Sena. As long as Uddhav Thackeray leads the party, it has no future, Narayan Rane told reporters on Friday.

 This was the murmur in the party headquarters for long. But for the first time, grievances against Uddhav, an urbane, soft-spoken man with a keen interest in wild-life photography, are being openly aired. Uddhavs failings ? including his ideological and organisational weaknesses ? are being discussed at length. He is not aware of issues and hasnt launched a mass agitation, says Purandare. The Congress-Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) government of 1999 to 2004 was a failure, but Uddhav couldnt exploit it.

 Race for succession

 The Sena is seemingly on a political sabbatical, with all its activities revolving around sub-sects. There are Sainiks who are loyal to Uddhav and those who support Raj. Former speaker Manohar Joshi has his group of loyalists, and there are those who back Rane to the hilt. This is nothing but an ego clash, says former Sena member of Parliament, Sanjay Nirupam, who left the party in a huff in March this year.

 That there was trouble brewing was visible to all. Several weeks ago, NCP leader Sharad Pawar raised the issue with the Congress high command. The Sena was going to split, he told the Congress ? and Rane was on his way out. What had to be seen was whether Rane and his men could be accommodated in the Congress or the NCP, or whether theyd function as a fringe party. But whatever he did, Pawar is said to have pointed out, the Sena stood to lose.

 When Chhagan Bhujbal split the party in 1991, it was seen as a flash in the pan. When Raj Thackeray was marginalised, there was some consternation, but a large section of the Sena still pinned its hope on the young heir apparent. 

 When Nirupam left, not many in the Sena were worried about the impact that his departure would have on the party. Or, when Thackeray cornered Suresh Prabhu, a popular minister in the erstwhile National Democratic Alliance government, it was shrugged off as a minor matter. 

 But now that the former Konkani chief minister has sounded the bugle of revolt, its become clear that Bal Thackeray, who once ruled the party with an iron fist, has lost his touch.

 Ailing now, the man whose pen got thousands of Sainiks out on the streets on any issue, is mostly closeted at home. Observers believe that he started withdrawing from street-corner politics soon after the Sena formed its government with the Bharatiya Janata Party in 1995. The Sena was in a position of power, and there was money coming in, says an insider. And, as Thackeray started complaining of recurring stomach problems, the second rung in the Sena started to assert itself.

 But Thackeray decided to pass on the baton that once worked like a gavel to his son. And, in the process, instead of putting a lid on dissidence, he flagged off a bitter race for succession.

 Bal Thackeray wants to pass the reins of the party to his son who apparently seems incapable of taking the party along with him, says a Mumbai-based social analyst. Instead, Uddhav has resorted to playing the same ivory-tower politics his father practised. For Thackeray Senior this was easily done, but for Uddhav, its easier said than done, the analyst says.

 Thackeray was in his ivory tower, but he was not inaccessible to the people. An old Sena hand recalls how Thackeray would stir out after his postprandial libation ? sometimes late at night, and occasionally smoking a cigar ? to see what was happening at the shakhas, Sena offices set up in every city ward. Somebody would be pulled up if the shakhas were unmanned, somebody would be praised, he says. And the Sainiks respected him for that.

 Purandare points out that Thackeray knew workers by their names. His greatest strength was that he connected with the people, says the writer. He went out of his way to establish connections.

 But Uddhav keeps to himself and, former leaders such as Rane complain, has little time for his workers. Any leader should be available to his workers, says Nirupam. If you dont have the time to interact with party workers, you should resign.

 There was one incident, in recent times, that Rane has been regaling people with. A party worker, known for unsavoury activities, had been banned from entering his district and had gone to Uddhav seeking help. The worker later told Rane that he sat there for four or five hours, waiting to see Uddhav. Finally, an aide told him to come back another day. The boss cant meet you today. A fish that he got from the US for Rs 1.5 lakh has died, and he is feeling miserable, the worker was told. Come back after a few days.

 The fish story has a sub-text that the Sainiks like to underline. The party once had a leader who commanded immediate action from its workers who would ransack offices or disrupt meetings every time Samna, the Sena paper Bal Thackeray edits, barked out an order. But now, the party leader is more concerned about the death of a fish than the grievances of a worker, says the insider.

 Point, counterpoint

 For Thackeray, who made a party out of peoples grievances, this should be a cause for concern. The party started as a platform for disgruntled Maharashtrians who rose against the migrants, seen to be taking away their jobs. The issues it took up were unemployment and inflation ? and other emotive local subjects that ensured the support of the predominantly Konkan base of the Sena. And as the base grew, spreading to adjoining areas, so did the might of Thackeray.

 The effect of Thackerays roar ? once said to have incited riots ? was visible even when Bhujbal left the party. For several months after his departure, Bhujbal could not attend a single public meeting because Sainiks, obeying Thackerays command, threatened to attack him.

 After I defected, there were innumerable attacks by Sena lumpens who were ordered to annihilate me, says Chhagan Bhujbal. As the leader of the Opposition, I was attacked even in my government-allotted residence, with a Sena mob literally breaking down each of the doors of the house to reach me. Providentially, an unarmed constable shouted fire and the mob fled, Bhujbal adds.

 Rane, so far, has faced no such problems. There has been no statement by the Sena patriarch invoking violence against him. In fact, Ranes supporters even dispelled a mob of Sainiks who tried to break into his Chembur residence on Tuesday. Thackerays statement published the next day in Samna was cautious. Do not cast the first stone, but if attacked, retaliate, he said. This was certainly not the trademark roar that Mumbai had got used to.

 Even the posters on the walls were curiously lacking in vitriol. The notice board placed outside the Amboli Shiv Sena Shakha simply read: Congratulations to the Shiv Sena pramukh Balasaheb Thackeray for expelling Shri Narayan Rane for committing anti-party activities.

 Says Rane, While the public notice terming me a gaddaar (traitor) was prepared and faxed to various shakhas from Uddhavs office, I received scores of faxes from those very shakhas stating their support for me and refusing to pay heed to the Sena working presidents orders.

 Dwindling base

 Some say the Senas meek reaction stems from the fact that the party has lost its teeth, having yielded popular support over the years. Mumbais demography has changed ? with the constituency of Maharashtrians, the Sena base, dwindling from about 42 per cent four decades ago to the present 22 per cent. Electorally, the Sena has been on the decline. Before the last election, the Sena and the BJP together held five of the six Parliamentary seats in Mumbai. In 2004, the combine had lost four of the five.

 The other reason Rane may not get the Bhujbal treatment is that he himself represented Senas muscle power. And there are some in the Sena who stress that Thackeray still cant hit out at Rane, who was for long years his closest confidant, besides being one of the main financiers of the party.

 The fact is Thackeray was always fond of Rane who stood steadfastly by him, says a Sena leader, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Even after raising the banner of revolt Rane still makes clear his everlasting respect for Thackeray. His only grouse is against Uddhav and his cronies as he has clearly stated. But Balasaheb is torn between his love for his son and heir apparent and fondness for the former rock within the party.

 Plummeting fortunes

 There was a time when Rane put Thackerays words into action. A Congressman recalls how Rane once led a group of Shiv Sena MLAs to stop Bhujbal, who had threatened to arrest Thackeray, from entering the state legislature. Somehow, Bhujbal managed to enter the building with his posse of armed men. Seeing this, an incensed Rane began raining blows on his party MLAs for having let Bhujbal pass, says the Congress leader.

 So, clearly, it is not going to be easy for Thackeray to take Rane, a Konkani-speaking Maratha, on. And Ranes breaking away may leave fissures in the party that will show up in the days to come. Ranes strong presence in the Konkan region ? he is from Sindhudurg ? may take away Konkani votes from the Sena. This is bad news for the Sena, says Purandare. The very region that supports it is going to be divided, he says.

 What is equally evident is that the churning in the Sena is far from over. Uddhav will assert himself, while Rane will do his bit to chisel away support from the Sena. And, elsewhere, Raj Thackeray will start marking out his territory. Already, leaflets are being distributed in Mumbai, asking the Real Sainiks to gather at Shivaji Park. The buzz is that Rajs men are behind the leaflets. And, ensconced in Matoshree, Bal Thackeray watches as the party gives way. And if he is roaring, the sound is like that of a lion in a commercial who needs cough drops: more of a whimper than a roar.

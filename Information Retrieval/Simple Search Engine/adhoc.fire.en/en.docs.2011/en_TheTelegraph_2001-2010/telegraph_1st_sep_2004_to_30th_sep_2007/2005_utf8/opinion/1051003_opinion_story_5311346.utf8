 AN INTERRUPTED RELATIONSHIP

 TWENTY-TWENTY 

/ BHARAT BHUSHAN

 Uncle Sam doesn?t approve

 There are two ways of looking at India?s September 24 vote at the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna. The pragmatic argument is that it was not a vote against Iran or a vote for the United States of America ? it was a vote for India?s national interest. The criticism of this position has been that in doing so India has surrendered its relationship with Iran, succumbed to US pressure, and undermined its stated commitment to non-alignment. However, even measured by the pragmatic yardstick of national interest, India?s vote is of questionable benefit. 

 ?Pragmatists? argue that as India?s international stature grows, it would become increasingly necessary for it to take decisions that would entail breaking away from its earlier policy frameworks. The important thing is that these decisions are informed and motivated by national interest.

 India has never been in favour of Iran going nuclear and had even denied it an experimental reactor in the early Nineties. India?s position has been that Iran should adhere to its obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The trade deals with Iran ought to stand on their own merit. 

 Within this framework then, the vote at Vienna is projected as a vote against further proliferation. Besides, those arguing within this framework ask: Does India want to be at the High Table with the big boys or be led by Venezuela, Peru and Ghana? The agenda of non-alignment ? of decolonization, opposition to apartheid, international cooperation for development, nuclear disarmament and independence in decision-making ? is virtually complete. While nuclear disarmament is understood by India in its national interest, in voting against Iran, they argue, New Delhi is practising independence in decision making. 

 As for historical ties with Iran, they claim, they were either pre-Islamic or established between rulers during Islamic times. The only common interest that India has with Iran is in Afghanistan and for that Tehran needs us as much as we need them. 

 This is essentially rationalization. If India thought that the US would not like a strong relationship with Iran ? especially in view of the existing US Congressional legislation with respect to Iran ? it should not have entered into a strategic partnership with it.

 India should have decided beforehand whether or not its interests were linked to Iranian nuclearization. Where was the need then for external affairs minister, K. Natwar Singh, to visit Tehran, days before the prime minister was scheduled to meet President George W. Bush in New York? Why did he have to make boastful statements about being the first foreign dignitary to have visited since the new government took over? He ended up inviting insulting comments from a powerful US Congressman who called him ?dense?.

 Even now it is difficult to argue that Indian interests are linked with Iran?s nuclear pursuit. The Iranian bomb, if it comes about, may be a headache for Israel but not for India. There is no logic in saying that India cannot accept another nuclear power in its neighbourhood. India lives with a nuclear Pakistan and China. If the non-existent Iranian bomb is a problem for the whole world, then a simple audit of nuclear weapons and those who possess them would show who the real threat to international peace is. What the dubious arguments being put forward now imply is that India?s Iran policy was wrong and the inherent problems with it are becoming apparent only now. 

 But could it be that India?s Iran policy was not as unthinking as is being made out now? There are not only cultural, religious but also strong geo-political reasons for forging strong ties with Iran. 

 Tehran?s religious leadership has a strong influence on Indian Shias, especially in Jammu and Kashmir. It makes sense to forge close ties with Tehran so that it does not get too close to Islamabad. Iran is our only route to Afghanistan and central Asia. At a time when Pakistan refuses to give India transit rights for trade to Afghanistan, the development of the Chabahar port has opened up a new trade route to Afghanistan through Zaranj on the Iran-Afghanistan border. Iran, Russia and India are jointly developing a North-South transport corridor linking Caspian Sea and southern Russia to Bandar Abbas. 

 The US arguments on the Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline were wrong to begin with. Only a part of the investment was in Iran which could be made by Tehran itself. The Americans did not object to the deal signed by India for five million tonnes of LNG with Iran earlier this year. Besides, at a time when the Europeans (especially the French oil giant, Total) and the Japanese already have large investments in Iran, it makes little sense to force India to isolate Tehran. 

 India behaved in the way it has because the US looms very large in India?s foreign policy thinking today. This began during the regime of Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The general sapping of the spirit, the recognition of the US as an all too powerful nation to be allied with has continued in the present regime. President Bush?s openness to India has enticed the Indian policy establishment.

 Most importantly, however, the civilian nuclear cooperation deal offered by President Bush has put India firmly on his side. New Delhi always knew that the key to ending its nuclear isolation after Pokhran-II was always in US hands. Now that restrictions are being removed under the new deal, its interest is in keeping to that bargain.

 The important question to ask, however, is whether India should allow its foreign policy to become hostage to nuclear cooperation with the US. If there were a clear congruence of thinking between Washington and New Delhi with respect to our region and broad international trends, then even the nuclear deal might make sense. If the US was playing ball with India on Pakistan, supporting its interests would be logical. But that is not the case.

 Even then, the nuclear deal needs to be protected from being undermined by extraneous issues. The US Congress routinely links extraneous issues to such deals. The Iran vote has shown precisely that.

 It is true that sometimes the US Congress sees things differently than the US administration. However, its objections can also be stage-managed to leverage US interests. Today it is Iran; tomorrow the objection could be to other Indian policies that the US Congress does not like. India seems to be getting into a situation where the US and the US Congress can control, monitor and direct its foreign policy.

 Should India, therefore, allow itself to become hostage to the nuclear deal with the US? It is better that the nuclear deal gets into trouble now over Iran or else one might witness Tarapur revisited ten times over.

 Condoleezza Rice seeking concessions for Pakistan from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in New York showed that the US has been pressuring New Delhi to cede its national interest vis-?-vis Pakistan. It has succeeded in that task with Iran. We are witnessing a strange phenomenon ? Iran, which is good for India but bad for the US is to be shunned by us but Pakistan, which is good for the US, and bad for us ought to be cultivated. Does acquiescing with this make any sense?

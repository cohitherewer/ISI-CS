 LOOK LEFT, LOOK RIGHT, BUT FIRST LOOK WITHIN

 Losing ground to the Congress is the real threat that Subrata Mukherjee?s breakaway poses for the Trinamool Congress, writes Ashis Chakrabarti

 Alliance invited

 Even if you do not admire her politics, you cannot deny that Mamata Banerjee remains the most popular opposition leader in West Bengal. This is so despite her recent electoral reverses. It would be na?ve to suggest that Subrata Mukherjee does not know this. So why did he decide to break away from the Trinamool Congress leader and that too on the eve of the elections to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation which he ran as perhaps the most successful mayor in recent years? 

 Those who are critical of Mukherjee?s action offer two explanations. Given his growing differences with Banerjee, they say, it was almost certain that Mukherjee would not have been chosen for the mayor?s post for a second time in case the Trinamool Congress-Bharatiya Janata Party won the civic elections again. So his revolt is actually a revenge planned in advance. 

 The second reason offered for Mukherjee?s action follows from the first. He is said to have been planning for some time to return to the Congress. Apart from the never-ending bickerings with Banerjee and her close party aides, most of whom have little love lost for him, two things may have influenced Mukherjee?s moves. When he was defeated in the last Lok Sabha elections from the traditionally anti-left Calcutta Northwest constituency by Sudhansu Sil of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), he realized that it was not enough to be a good mayor to win elections even in the city. 

 Since his defeat was primarily because of the division of anti-left votes between him and Sudip Bandyopadhyay, who had left the Trinamool and fought the polls as a Congress-supported independent candidate, Mukherjee was convinced that a Congress-Trinamool alliance was the only hope of seriously challenging the CPI(M) in the state. The importance of the electoral alliance was also proved by his reign at the Calcutta corporation, where the Trinamool-BJP board?s survival depended on the support of the Congress. 

 With the Congress back in power in New Delhi as the leader of the United Progressive Alliance, the impulse to desert the Trinamool-BJP combine grew stronger. If he still had any doubt, that was taken care of by old Congress mentors like Pranab Mukherjee and Priya Ranjan Das Munshi. Mukherjee?s argument is that he is doing now what Banerjee had done in 2001. And an alliance between the Trinamool and the Congress can do much better now because of the rise of the Congress?s fortunes in national politics.

 It is not difficult, therefore, to see why Banerjee is fuming at not only Mukherjee but also the Congress ?conspirators? who are out to break her party. Publicly, she gives her reasons for opposing any alliance with the Congress, not just in Calcutta, but also for the 79 municipalities in the state which are going to the polls this month. How can she join hands with a Congress whose coalition government at the Centre survives on the support of the left? Besides, a Congress-Trinamool alliance in the assembly elections in 2001 failed to halt the left juggernaut. So why go for it again? 

 You cannot deny her argument some obvious merits. Also, if her decision to ditch the BJP and ally with the Congress in 2001 smacked of political opportunism, Mukherjee?s move is open to the same charge. But, she did not have any qualms about taking the support of the Congress at the Calcutta corporation and many other municipalities in the districts. Even in the run-up to the coming elections, her partymen have joined hands with both the Congress and the BJP in many places. And this despite her warnings to partymen not to go for alliances with the Congress at any level. 

 If the Trinamool workers are still defying her and allying with the Congress in the districts, that is because they see it as a much more viable alternative than the alliance with the BJP. In fact, in scores of municipalities, all three opposition parties are trying, as far as the local conditions allow it, to form the so-called mahajot or grand alliance against the left. This trend was also evident in the 2003 panchayat elections. Obviously, the compulsions of national politics do not stand in the way of the local attempts to build an anti-left platform. 

 Privately, most Trinamool leaders admit that if the mahajot does not work out, it is a better bet to go with the Congress than with the BJP. The BJP?s anti-Muslim politics makes it a liability for the Trinamool. The last Lok Sabha elections proved that large sections of the Muslims had started returning to the Congress in areas such as north Bengal, where the party stood a chance of beating the left. The Muslim factor explains why, despite being a partner in the National Democratic Alliance, the Trinamool seems to be anxious not to do much business with the BJP except during the elections. Banerjee knows it is a rather uneasy alliance that she is forced to carry on with because of the compulsions of national politics.

 To my mind, Mamata Banerjee?s opposition to Subrata Mukherjee?s move stems primarily from her fear of losing the position of the main opposition force in Bengal to the Congress. She may have failed against the left; but it would be a completely different matter if she cannot retain her position vis-?-vis the Congress. If that happens and the Congress becomes the principal opposition to the left, she may face a serious threat to keeping her party intact. That really is the threat that Mukherjee?s revolt poses to her. Going by the trend in all recent elections ? to the municipalities in 2000, the panchayats in 2003 and the Lok Sabha in 2004 ? it is a real enough threat. 

 For all the differences and tensions, though, an undeclared alliance between the Trinamool and the Congress, at least in some parts of Calcutta, is always on the cards. Imagine a scenario where the new anti-left alliance, led by Mukherjee, finds itself in the same position at the Calcutta corporation that the Trinamool found itself in 2000. If a post-election situation emerges in which the civic board will fall to the left unless the Trinamool and the Congress make common cause to prevent it, it is safe to predict that the two estranged leaders will reunite to rule Calcutta again. 

 But then, there is also the possibility that Mukherjee?s revolt will actually harm the opposition cause and end up giving the left an advantage. Even in 2000, the Trinamool-BJP combine managed to secure a thin margin over the left in the Calcutta elections. If the trends in subsequent polls are any indication, a left comeback in Calcutta, aided by the division in the Trinamool, looks eminently possible. Unlike in many other states, voting patterns in Bengal do not vary dramatically for local, state or national elections. 

 But from Banerjee?s point of view, a left win in Calcutta will be just as disastrous as the Trinamool losing ground to the Congress here. The real political significance of Mukherjee?s gamble, therefore, lies not so much in what it does to the left as in its potential to help revive the Congress?s fortunes in Bengal. A stronger Congress may force Banerjee to rethink her strategy yet again.

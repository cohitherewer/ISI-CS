 TIME TO BELL THE CAT 

 Shomita Mukherjee

 The hue and cry over Sariska just touches the tip of the iceberg. The CBI has said that tiger census figures so far have been grossly exaggerated. To people acquainted with this area, this is no path-breaking revelation. If tiger numbers do not increase from one year to the next, it is taken to be a job badly done. Even officials aware of tiger deaths would hesitate to mention these for the fear of being hauled up for neglecting their duty. 

 There never could be more than 10 tigers in Sariska ? there was no room for more. One of our oldest tiger reserves, Sariska has a highly fragmented landscape due to the presence of several villages. Although on paper the area under the tiger reserve is 800 sq kms, the area available for animals is far less. The aridity of the area poses limitations on the tiger as well as on its prey.

 My research work on the jungle cat, caracal and golden jackal between 1994-96 gave me the opportunity to see Sariska very closely. Even in those days, tigers in Sariska were far from safe. In 1994, I came across the body of a dead, skinned tiger that was found by the forest staff. The matter was hushed up. Later that year, my assistants came across a wild boar with its mouth blasted open by the crude bait-bombs that are frequently used. There were gunshots every evening ? it was a free-for-all. 

 Dead and gone

 Over the months, I came across several hunting-hideouts inside the forest. I brought these to the notice of the Cat Specialists Group of the IUCN, and also took the deputy inspector general of forests and the director of the Wildlife Institute of India, to these places. The chief wildlife warden, I believe, had the hideouts destroyed in 1996, but I do not know if further monitoring was done.

 During my last year in Sariska, I monitored the movement and growth of two tiger cubs. They were healthy and curious. I had a most memorable encounter with them atop a ridge. Subsequently, I used to see them almost every day, often flushing them out of bushes while I was conducting my work. The last time I saw them was a couple of days before I left Sariska in May 1996. A few weeks later I heard that one cub was found dead. The forest department?s post-mortem concluded ?tuberculosis?. No questions were asked.

 Better equipped

 Poaching of various species was going on all the time inside the reserve and park ? a fact overlooked by the entire conservation community. The field director, later suspended for corruption, had served two terms in Sariska. The subsequent field directors did little to improve the situation. All along, efforts were made to get the best possible directors for Ranthambhore. Why could not the same be done for Sariska? The park has been utilized to the fullest for personal gains. Suspensions of forest officials are an eyewash.

 But then, ?what next?? I believe that in Sariska humans and animals cannot co-exist. People-oriented NGOs should realize that the lives of the villagers inside are ridden with difficulties due to lack of medical facilities, schools, electricity, veterinary facilities and transport. Simultaneously, the living conditions of the forest staff, especially forest guards who do the toiling, need to be dramatically improved. The state forest department needs structural and functional reforms. Guards need to be equipped to gather intelligence and deal with illegal activities.

 Recommendations from past research in the area must be put into practice, and monitoring by independent organizations encouraged. If wildlife is not given the same importance as our security concerns, we will achieve little. What is the point of fiercely guarding our borders when we destroy all that is valuable inside?

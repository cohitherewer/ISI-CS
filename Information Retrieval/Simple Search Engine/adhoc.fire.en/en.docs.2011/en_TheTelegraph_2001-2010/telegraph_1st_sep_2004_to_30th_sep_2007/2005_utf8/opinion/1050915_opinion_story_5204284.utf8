 GIVING A HERO HIS DUE

 Raju Mukherji

 The ministry of defence needs to be complimented. Taking a pragmatic view of things, it has agreed to allow Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore to appear in advertisements as a model. He was not permitted to appear in modelling assignments earlier as he was serving in the Indian army. At a time when racing car drivers and cricket and football players are earning millions, it would have been a travesty of justice if one of India?s top sportsmen was denied his rightful financial bounty. 

 In India, we honour average sportsmen with national awards, allowing them to earn phenomenal amounts through endorsements. A Formula One driver, who finishes poorly in every major race, has his face splashed all over the media. Cricket, hockey and football players of doubtful sporting pedigree are hailed as superstars.Yet prominent sports stars who have done the country proud are given the short shrift when it comes to publicity, and consequently end up being losers in financial deals.

 The right move

 It is in this context that the decision of the ministry of defence deserves praise. The government administrators, especially the army chief, General J.J. Singh, had the courage to overhaul the age-old view of not allowing defence personnel to make money out of the terms of employment. That the authorities had taken cognizance of present day realities and were willing to remove the hurdles that stood in the way of a talented sportsman is encouraging news.

 In another healthy development, the ministry has decided that 5 per cent of Rathore?s earnings from endorsements would be deposited with the army. This money would be used to promote sports in the armed sector. This decision should be appreciated because it acknowledges the contribution of the support staff in the army in the making of a champion.

 Lieutenant Colonel Rathore is an army man through and through. His every word speaks volumes of his maturity and moderation. He has no time for making controversial statements nor the desire for making lame excuses. He does not believe in cultivating contacts in the media, nor does he kowtow to sports officialdom. So far, he has refrained from making a beeline for petty traders to use his name for running eateries. Neither has he lolled about on plastic pillows (called medicine balls) to fool gullible sports lovers into thinking that he is training. He has also never felt the need for foreign coaches to hone his skills.

 Bang on target

 Rathore is an inspiration to the country?s youth and has proved that Indians can become Olympic medallists. He overcame innumerable odds as he shot his way to the silver medal at the Athens Olympics ? the first- ever individual silver medallist in the Olympic Games from independent India. 

 The decision to allow Rathore to appear in endorsements would have certain positive consequences. The most important being that the Indian youth would now be motivated to join the defence forces. They will realize that they too would get the opportunity to concentrate on sporting activities, and if they were good enough they would get an opportunity to win even higher honours. 

 Sponsors and advertisers queuing up to sign Rathore would send the right signals to the truly deserving: if you could make it to international level, then there would be big monetary prizes waiting for you as well. Finally, Rathore?s coming to modelling might put a lot of undeserving sportsmen, earning millions as models, into the shade.

 Thus, there are some very good reasons to congratulate the army for its healthy policy of giving the deserving champion his due.

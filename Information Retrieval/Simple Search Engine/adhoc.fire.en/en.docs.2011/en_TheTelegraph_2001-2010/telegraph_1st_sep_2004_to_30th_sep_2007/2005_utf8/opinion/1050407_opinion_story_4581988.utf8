 POLL VAULT

 The prime minister of Britain, Mr Tony Blair, has gone to the country but he has done so under a shadow. The cloud over the next general elections to be held on May 5 does not concern the fact that in the opinion polls, the Conservative Party is closing the gap on the Labour Party. Neither does it have anything to do with the apprehension that this election campaign is going to be acrimonious and personal. The shadow is about the electoral malpractices which were perpetrated in Birmingham during the last elections. Vast numbers of ballot papers were sent to one address and then they were tampered with a liberal use of correction fluid. The scale of the fraud has made the investigating judge, Mr Richard Mawrey, describe the vote-rigging as one that would ?disgrace a banana republic?. Britain has obviously learnt from one of its former colonies the art of rigging elections. Having experienced a colossal abuse of democracy, Britain can also learn from India how to begin the work of cleaning up the electoral process. Without such a cleansing process, Britain might find itself participating in a farce masquerading as a democracy.

 The opening salvoes of the election campaign suggest that this might turn out to be an election sans issue. Launching his party?s campaign, the Tory leader, Mr Michael Howard, said that electors were free to ?vote for another five years of talk?. His main line of attack was not the policies that Mr Blair and his government have followed. Rather, he chose to target Mr Blair as a prime minister who does not keep his promises. He warned voters that ?Mr Blair says one thing to get your vote on polling day and does something different afterward.? Significantly, what was absent from Mr Howard?s opening remarks was an attack on Mr Blair?s high taxation policy and a reiteration of the Tory shibboleths of low taxes, small government and personal freedom. Dyed-in-the-wool conservatives have always argued that in the eight years of Mr Blair?s premiership, all these three elements have been severely undermined.

 To his critics, right and left, Mr Blair has always been an ideological blur. But this has not stopped him from running away with the Tory party?s clothes. He knows that despite the recent rise in their popularity curve, the Tories have become confined to their traditional bastion, rural Britain. The famous ?Essex man? of the Thatcher era now probably votes for New Labour. Mr Blair has already indicated what the three planks of his campaign are going to be: the strength of the economy, low inflation and low mortgage rates. He is going to make the pitch that another term for Labour will provide greater stability to Britain. The choice before the British people may not be as big as Mr Blair has made it out to be, but the path to Downing Street, for Mr Blair or Mr Howard, is bound to be dirty.

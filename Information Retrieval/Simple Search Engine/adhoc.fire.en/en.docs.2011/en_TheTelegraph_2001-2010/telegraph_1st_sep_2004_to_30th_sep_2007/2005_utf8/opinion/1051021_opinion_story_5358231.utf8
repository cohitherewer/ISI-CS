 NEW TEXTS FOR THE NEW AGE

 Special needs

 Outside the university presses and some small publishers there are few takers for academic books. And when they are, it takes three years or more in the purgatory that separates submission and publication. Why are there publication lags and why do publishers shy away from scholarly books when there is a niche library market where price is not a restraining factor?

 Take the delays first. There are two basic reasons: the review process and the much-needed copy editing that needs to be done before a manuscript is sent to press.

 All scholarly books have to be sent for review to outside experts because publishers don?t have in-house editors to evaluate the book. They can take care of language and perhaps style but when it comes to the nitty-gritty of content and fact-checking of obscure details, it become necessary to go outside the house. Publishers boast of a panel of academic editors but in reality they they can?t afford them. And it is when they go out that all the troubles arise.

 First, it is very difficult find the right academic. Most academic books are spun out of doctoral theses, which means a very narrow academic sub-specialization in which there are few experts. The hunt for possible reviewers invariably takes time, and assuming you can find them and they agree to take on the job, it does not mean that they would deliver their report within the stipulated time. Often they don?t. 

 Second, the confidentiality factor. Reviewers rightly insist that their identity be kept a closely-guarded secret if a critical, well-balanced report, with all the pros and cons, is to be given. The academia is a very small world, and a leak, especially if the report is critical, could mar relationships between individuals. When confidentiality cannot be guaranteed, why should the reviewer stick his neck out? He opts out in most cases, or glosses over the work to recommend publication. Experienced publishers know how to read such reports and therefore take a second opinion in the hope next-time round a report would be more satisfactory. Besides, busy academics loath to take up reviewing not merely because it takes them away from their lectures and research but also because they are poorly paid for their efforts. Review fees offered by Indian publishers are pathetic. 

 But the steady flow of qualified referees is just one part of the problem. The more serious is the general quality of work submitted for publication: most bristle with factual errors, poor grammar and a ponderous style, and are grossly over-written. But the exercise of sprucing them up takes a great deal of time because it has to be done with the active collaboration of the author.

 Quite apart from these two specific problems, there is the general climate of the market to be taken into account. Like all other things, publishing has become a sub-division of the entertainment industry. Serious scholarship has to be packaged in clear, simple language, accessible to the common reader and not become ?the heavy industry of the mind?. If it continues to do so, it won?t make money and publishers will change tack. Like it or not, the market takes all.

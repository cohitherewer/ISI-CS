 Letters to Editor

 A city drained of colour

 Sir ? Have the colours vanished from Calcutta? Even a few years back, during Holi, there would be merry children on the streets, sprinkling colours on one another and on passers-by? The streets are no longer doused in colour, and the children seem to have disappeared, perhaps inside the muti-storeyed building complexes. There are also fewer kites in the Calcutta skies during the kite-flying season. Who knows, with community activities becoming increasingly unfashionable, para cricket too may soon become history.

 Yours faithfully,

Soham Gupta, Calcutta

 Two for sorrow

 Sir ? It is bewildering to find so many off-spinners being reported against for having suspect bowling actions ? Muttiah Muralitharan, Shoaib Malik, Mohammad Hafeez, Harbhajan Singh, and the list continues. What is especially notable in this is that only the biomechanics and software experts, and not the umpires and match referees, can judge whether or not a bowler is throwing. The simple reason behind this is that the human eye is not equipped with a compass so that it can determine whether or not the angle of the bowling arm during delivery is exceeding the stipulated limit of 15 degrees. The International Cricket Council should see to it that such technical wrangles do not jeopardize the careers of cricketers and hinder the globalization of the game.

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Sir ? The doosra of Harbhajan Singh is one of its kind, and the umpires and match referees still cannot figure out what has hit them. The recent allegations made by Chris Broad, the match referee for the Calcutta test, smells like another Muralitharan episode brewing. Going by the list of bowlers pulled up for ?chucking?, the theory of discrimination against the players of the subcontinent cannot be ruled out. It is understandable that Harbhajan Singh should be annoyed, since this comes after he went through the strenuous bio-mechanic tests and received a clean chit from the ICC. But why these tests in the first place? They only take away from the fun of the game. Just because there is technology does not mean we have to take its help at each step. 

 Besides, treating a player like a criminal and pressurizing him can destroy his morale and his natural game. The funniest thing about the entire rigmarole is that Steve Bucknor, who makes mistakes even in giving the simplest lbw decisions, can with such precision point out Harbhajan?s degree of elbow straightening. Now howzatt?

 Yours faithfully,

Rashmi Jaiswal, Howrah

 Sir ? I read Kapil Dev?s observations about the impossibility of visually ascertaining whether the bowler?s arm is bent ?15 degrees or 18 or 12? (?Kapil support for Harbhajan?, March 24). Being an engineer, I know it is quite impossible. The ICC will have to review the new rule soon. It also needs to have a discussion among its members about standardizing the size of the international cricket grounds.

 Yours faithfully,

K.B. Goswami, Calcutta

 Daylight robbery

 Sir ? Our chief minister often promises that he will stop the destruction of our wetlands. But can?t he see, on his way to the Dum Dum airport ? where he has to go frequently ? how the long stretch of wetlands from Ultadanga on the west side of VIP Road is being filled up ? Even the media has done precious little to highlight this. Will the civic bodies produce maps of both sides of VIP Road ten years back, and as it stands now, and allow us to compare? 

 Yours faithfully,

Santanu Datta, Calcutta

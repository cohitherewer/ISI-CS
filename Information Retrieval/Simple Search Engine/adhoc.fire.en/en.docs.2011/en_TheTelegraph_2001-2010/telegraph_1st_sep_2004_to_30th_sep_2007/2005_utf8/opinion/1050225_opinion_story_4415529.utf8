 FUNNY FACES IN A MIRROR

 Free spirits

Fire and other images

By Paritosh Sen, 

Tulika, Rs 375

?The beauty of nature, the company of pleasant people, 

good food and drink ? this is an irresistible combination,? writes Paritosh Sen 

in Fire and Other Images. Sen, a painter and a writer of considerable repute, 

has been fortunate in savouring most of these experiences in the course of a fascinating 

life. The essays and stories in this book, translated from three of his earlier 

Bengali works, evoke a world which we have lost, but one that is resurrected here 

with the help of beautiful and absorbing prose.

 A remarkable aspect of these vignettes from Sen?s past is his duality as a creator. There is a strong connection between Sen the painter and Sen the writer. There is also the attempt to understand the present by the reminiscing of a distant past. His sensibilities as a painter complement his literary skills, helping to weave enchanting tales ? of a childhood spent in Dhaka, his days as ?one among forty thousand artists? in Paris, a summer in beautiful Carnforth in northern England, his travels to Egypt, Italy and the Mediterranean. The stories transcend the barriers of time, place and culture, and are about characters, both real and imaginary, which were central to Sen?s universe at the time.

 The characters that saunter in and out of Sen?s early life are a varied lot ? comic and tragic, rich and poor. There is Hafiz Mian, a tailor, who was more fond of flying pigeons than of making clothes, and yet tailored suits that needed no trials or measurements. Then there are the Nawab who, as the whole of Dhaka knew, was passionate about flying kites; Jitenbabu, a scene painter and an intemperate man who first imbibed in Sen the love for art; and of course, Prasannakumar, a skilled kaviraj of ample girth, much revered by his patients and feared by his brood of twenty children, the 17th being Sen.

 Some characters are not human at all. An arjun tree in Sen?s village ? a world of its own, complete with a social hierarchy ? on which birds, animals, reptiles perched according to their importance in the natural cycle. Or the hookahs in his father?s chamber, which were marked according to caste and class. There are also those images which instilled in Sen a sense of fear ? that of fire engulfing his father?s funeral pyre captures both the beauty and the horror of the moment, and continued to haunt him well into his youth. Some others were legends, who are stripped of all trappings and made simple and humane ? a child-like Picasso making funny faces in a convex mirror, a naked Brigitte Bardot reading a book in a nudist colony in France, and a serious-looking Brancusi talking about his creations in his spacious studio.

 One also cannot miss the humour in these lively stories. In Venice, a penniless Sen is forced to enact the role of a prince in a bizarre rendition of Indian dance in which Krishna, wearing dark-blue leotards, cavorts with the gopinis. Earlier in Dhaka, young Tapan, Sen?s cousin, gets invited to eat fish by a skinny, headless petni draped in a white sari, in the middle of the night. Many readers will recall Punyolata Chakraborty?s Chelebelar Dinguli and Lila Majumdar?s Ar kono khane.

 Not all the tales are equally engaging ? such as the one in which a bull with a habit of charging through Calcutta?s markets is worshipped by one Mr Iyer, who hopes to enhance his virility. But Sen?s sketches keep the reader?s mind from wandering. What Sen does manage to convey is that creativity can only be nurtured when one is free, a condition as rare today as in the world of his stories.

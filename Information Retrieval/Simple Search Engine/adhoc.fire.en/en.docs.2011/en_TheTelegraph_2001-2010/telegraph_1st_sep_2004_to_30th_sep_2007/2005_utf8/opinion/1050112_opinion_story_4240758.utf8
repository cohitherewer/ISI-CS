 CONFUSED STATE

 The best of times can sometimes cause the worst of confusions. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) is clearly riddled with such confusions. Except in the brief and largely inglorious regime of the United Front, the party never had the kind of impact on national politics that it now has because of its support to the United Progressive Alliance government. But this new-found role seems to have confounded the party, making it go into rhetorical overdrives in an attempt to wriggle out of its confusions. That obviously is the case with the CPI(M) central committee?s fulminations against the Congress?s alleged violations of the UPA government?s code of conduct. The Marxists have taken the Congress to task for allegedly bypassing parliament on important economic issues like the privatization of pension funds of government employees, patents and the sale of 74 per cent of the equity of private banks to foreign investors. It has also complained that the government has dragged its feet on legislation relating to protecting the interests of workers. The Congress is charged with pushing its own ?agenda? of benefiting ?big business and foreign capital?. There is no doubt that any attempt to undermine the importance of parliament will weaken democracy. But the main thrust of the CPI(M)?s chargesheet smacks of familiar left rhetoric against economic liberalization. 

 But the real point about the accusations could well be what they reveal about the accuser. Not that the CPI(M) did not know about the Congress?s position on contentious economic issues. The party decided to support the UPA government in spite of its differences with the Congress on these issues. The criticisms, therefore, betray the CPI(M)?s own dilemma over dealing with the contradictions that have marked its support to a Congress-led government. And the dilemma expressed itself in different voices within the party?s leadership on how to rein in the Congress. Mr Prakash Karat, who is expected to take over as general secretary in the party congress in April, sounded tougher than Mr Jyoti Basu, who advised his comrades not to rock the UPA boat by asking the government for too much too soon. There is no mistaking, though, a design in the Marxists? sabre-rattling. The rhetoric is also aimed at the party?s rank and file, which must have the illusion of a fight with bourgeois parties like the Congress.

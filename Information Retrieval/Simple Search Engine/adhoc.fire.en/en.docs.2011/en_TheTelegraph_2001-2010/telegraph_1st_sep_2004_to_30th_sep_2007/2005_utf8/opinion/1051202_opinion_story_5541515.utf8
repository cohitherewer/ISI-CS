 PRIZE DOES MATTER

 What readers want

 When you are trying to decide what book to buy in a bookshop, you are in a state of what academics describe as ?information asymmetry?. With so many books, there is no guarantee that if you liked an author?s first few books, you?ll like the others. You know less about any given book than its publishers do: presumably they have read it; you haven?t.

 So, you seek out other cues, whether advertisements, book reviews or word of mouth. But the most authoritative account comes from what economists call ?independent information providers?. But how many such ?providers? can you come across in the rush of daily life? So, literary prizes drawn up by impartial jurors become an important factor to boost sales.

 To take a few examples. When Arundhati Roy won the Booker Prize for The God of Small Things in 1997, worldwide sales exceeded a million copies, including 100,000 for the Indian edition, a record of sorts. In 1958, Pantheon published a translation of Dr Zhivago by Boris Pasternak. But it was a small edition by American standards ? of 4,000 copies. When Pasternak got the Nobel, it went on to sell 6 million copies in English alone! More recently, after Jhumpa Lahiri?s Interpreter of Maladies won the Pulitzer in 2000, it became a bestseller in the US and India.

 The consensus among editors and publishers now seems to be that literary prizes have become more important than marketing techniques like advertisements, direct mailings, reviews and launch parties. 

 There are two reasons for this shift. First, the competition for consumers? attention has grown so much more fierce. Prizes help to drum up publicity, the book gets talked about as the retailers pushes it by prominently displaying it on their shelves. Second, prizes are usually given to relatively unknown authors. This persuades publishers to risk first-timers who write off-the-beaten-track, non-formulaic books.

 Most prizes have a monetary reward, but, more importantly, they give the author publicity. This in turn often leads to writing assignments for newspapers and journals. It is important to remember that no author can live entirely on advances and royalties in the initial stages of a writing career; he/she has to supplement the income by writing elsewhere. 

 You might say that all this holds true for the West, because apart from Sahitya Akademi and Jnanpith awards, some in the regional languages, and those instituted for serious journalism by some national dailies, we have little else. But there is a growing realization that our writers and artists need to be recognized more widely, if only to make them more self sufficient to carry on with their creative work so that publishers get a wider pool of talent to choose from.

 So, here?s a modest proposal if the publishing industry wants to be more economically productive: give prizes only to first novelists and obscure authors. It will make them money, spinning cold print into gold.

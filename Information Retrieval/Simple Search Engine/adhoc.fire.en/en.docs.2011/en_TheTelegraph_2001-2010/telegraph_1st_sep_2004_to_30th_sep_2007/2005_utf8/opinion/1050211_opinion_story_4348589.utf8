 Letters to Editor

 Have money, will spend

 Sir ? Montek Singh Ahluwalia could have done better than give in to the requests of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Asim Dasgupta and grant West Bengal an additional Rs 100 crore in plan funds (?Bengal on the verge of a debt-trap?, Feb 8). Why could he not be a little more assertive on the need for fiscal prudence and responsibility in the state? Look at the figure of 111.5 per cent against ?salaries, pension and other fixed expenses as a percentage of revenue? compared to 75 per cent in all the states. As a matter of fact, Ahluwalia?s ?permission? to the Bhattacharjee-Dasgupta duo to borrow additionally through new bonds is risible. We, in Bengal, can little afford to forget how the state government had used the money obtained from the sale of West Bengal Infrastructure Development Corporation bonds to pay the babus? salaries instead of using them for more productive purposes. Should the Centre entertain such profligacy?

 Yours faithfully,

Asit Samanta, Calcutta

 Making it work

 Sir ? Amit Bhaduri has done well to bring into focus the ?two contesting models of Indian economic development? (?Deprived of a future?, Feb 2). As Bhaduri points out, India follows a model that assumes that there is no alternative to globalization, the World Trade Organization, free trade, the indispensability of foreign investment, and all this means accepting the rules set by rich and industrialized nations. But this model seems to be at the core of many of the problems our country has been facing. Bhaduri thus suggests the other model of an expanding domestic economy involving the poor and the marginalized, and accepting globalization only to the extent to which it is suitable. 

 This model, unfortunately, has never been considered by India?s ruling elite since independence. Little wonder that most of the so-called ?struggles for the poor? since then ? be it Vinoba Bhave?s Bhoodan movement or Jayaprakash Narayan?s ?total revolution? ? have yielded no positive results except bringing to power the likes of Laloo Prasad Yadav and Mulayam Singh Yadav. Unless the civil society and the political leadership initiate a genuine movement for the poor, we will continue to have farcical measures made by the ever-changing regimes at the helm. This trend is already being reflected in some policies of the present United Progressive Alliance, prodded by the self-serving left.

 Yours faithfully,

Atmaram Saraogi, Calcutta 

 Sir ? It is sad that the ?development? policy being pursued in India has made the underprivileged and the marginalized even more so. Besides, there is little trust in governance and politics. Every new proposal for the rural people is perceived as a political gimmick to strengthen vote banks. It is true that the pace of reforms cannot be slowed down at this stage. But have they really brought about a perceptible change in the unemployment scene in the country? 

 As a contrast, look at China. It has opened up to globalization, but this move has not adversely affected the interests of China?s weaker sections. China has wisely honoured the toil and sweat of its working classes by not compromising on factors which would directly influence their lives. India, on the other hand, has continued to abet selfish individuals in governance and their loot-and-scoot policies.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Abhirup Sarkar gives a valuable insight into the abstract idea of the rural employment guarantee bill (?Working at it?, Feb 1). The proposed scheme also carries dangerous inflationary implications for these areas, as more employment might trigger speculation on the retailers? part about the purchasing power of the local people. This could consequently mean a wholesale price raise across commodities without an actual rise in living standards of the poor in rural India. 

 There is another point to ponder on. Given India?s spiralling fiscal deficit and the unrealistic targets of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, it would be disastrous for the government to pump in more money into this scheme. As Sarkar mentions, political gimmickry has to be stopped if the long-term interest of the economy is to be ensured. 

 Cyclical unemployment is unavoidable in a market economy with its booms and recessions. However, it is structural unemployment that we have to counter. For this, the proverbial pie needs to be made bigger. We have to make it easier for enterprise to flourish. The government must give incentives to private firms to carry out infrastructural projects in rural and urban areas simultaneously. China has generated jobs in construction and infrastructure precisely in this way, and India is equally capable of doing a re-run. 

 Yours faithfully,

Aruni Mukherjee, Coventry, UK

 Sir ? Sarkar?s suggestion of developing and creating infrastructure at all levels in the rural areas is important. This will create genuine employment opportunities and also result in enduring benefits for the society. 

 Yours faithfully, 

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta

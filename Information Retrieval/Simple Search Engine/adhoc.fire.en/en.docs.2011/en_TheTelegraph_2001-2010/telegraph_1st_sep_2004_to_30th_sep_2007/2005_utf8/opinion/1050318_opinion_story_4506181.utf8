 FAR FROM ART

 A whole society constantly on edge is a frightening phenomenon. Nothing else can explain the violence with which a teacher turned on a five-year-old who had was not carrying her art-and-craft papers in a carry-bag as instructed. The child, predictably, is refusing to go back to school, and her father has contacted the police, after being disappointed at the school authorities? response to his complaint. Corporal punishment in schools, whether in the city or in the districts, has recently become a cause for concern. There have been a sufficient number of cases of cruel and violent punishment to prompt not just the government but the judiciary also to prohibit physical punishment. It is not surprising that such prohibitions should be ignored; rather, it is the increase in harshness that is surprising. Corporal punishment, irrespective of the age of the pupil, is a primitive method of disciplining. It is shockingly out of place among declared targets of modernization of syllabi and spread of primary and secondary education. That a reputed city school should find such violence all in a day?s work raises questions about teachers? understanding of the basic requirements of their job, which, evidently, has nothing to do with their academic qualifications. On a broader view, such incidents raise even more alarming questions about the quality of education being offered in the state, whether paid for or subsidized.

 Beyond all this, there is the question of culture. There is an ingrained habit among adults in this country to beat up children at the slightest provocation. The sharper tensions of contemporary everyday life have exacerbated this tendency. Modern methods and upgraded training have made no dent here. The habit of violence is taken too much for granted to be ?visible?. Because in this culture, children?s sensitivities, needs and rights are themselves invisible. Terror and regimentation are considered good enough for them.

 TO PUT THE MACHINERY IN PLACE

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the communique issued by the G8 nations at Gleneagles, July 8

 Supporting the UNSG?s work to strengthen the international humanitarian response system: the G8 members are working with the secretary-general to improve the speed of response, efficiency, responsibility, accountability and transparency of humanitarian assistance operations on the ground, while respecting the principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality and independence of humanitarian assistance.

 (d) Working with the African Union to promote the increased engagement of African governments to ensure that there is safe and unimpeded access to the population for humanitarian personnel, and to support, address and resolve humanitarian crises.

 Promoting good and responsive governance:

 13. We welcome African institutions? engagement in promoting and enhancing effective governance... Well-governed states are critical to peace and security; economic growth and prosperity; ensuring respect for human rights and promotion of gender equality and the delivery of essential services to the citizens of Africa. We will support African countries? efforts to make their governments more transparent, capable and responsive to the will of their people; improve governance at the regional level and across the continent; and strengthen the African institutions that are essential to this.

 14. In response to this African commitment, we will: (a) Help strengthen the AU and NEPAD, including through:

 . support, including flexible funding, for the AU and other pan African institutions such as the Pan-African Parliament;

 . appropriate and coordinated support to African countries in the implementation of their good governance national strategies...

 (b) Support greater transparency in public management, including revenues, budgets and expenditure, licences, procurement and public concessions, including through increased support to capacity-building in those African countries that are taking credible action against corruption...

 (c) Support African partners in signing and ratifying the AU Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption and provide support towards its implementation...

 (d) as part of our work to combat corruption and promote transparency, increase support to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and measures. We call on African resource-rich countries to implement ETTI or similar principles of transparency and on the World Bank, IMF and regional development banks to support them...

 (e) Call on African countries to implement the African Charter on Human and People?s Rights and its protocols in order to encourage respect for the rights of ethnic minorities, women and children.

 (f) Work vigorously for early ratification of the UN Convention Against Corruption and start discussions on mechanisms to ensure its effective implementation. Work to establish effective mechanisms... within our own administrations for the recovery of assets, including those stolen through corruption, taking into account final disposal of confiscated property where appropriate, and to return assets to their legitimate owners. We encourage all countries to promulgate rules to deny entry and safe haven, when appropriate, to officials and individuals found guilty of public corruption, those who corrupt them, and their assets.

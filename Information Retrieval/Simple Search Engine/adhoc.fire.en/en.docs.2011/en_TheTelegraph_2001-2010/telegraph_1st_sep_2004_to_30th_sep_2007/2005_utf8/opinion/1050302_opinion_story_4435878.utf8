 Letters to Editor

 The little devils

 Sir ? A company will do anything (or as much as it can get away with) to sell its products. That?s what makes the capitalist world go round. So what are food companies who use Shrek and Scooby Doo ? cartoon characters adored by children ? on packs of sugary snacks, crisps and other processed foods being accused of (?Fatty foods spring Scooby on children?, Feb 25)? If being manipulative is a crime, one can find fault with nine ads out of ten. It is up to the parents to regulate eating habits to stand up to ?pester power?. In fact, it is parents? inability to say a firm ?no? to this packet of chips or that bottle of cold drink that has led to the ?epidemic? of obese children. But wouldn?t it have been far more practical for the consumer watchdogs to turn their attention to manufacturers of the food-stuff with the far-beyond-permissible-levels of salt, sugar and fat in them?

Yours faithfully, 

S. Mukherjee, Calcutta

Beastly tales

Sir ? Man, who takes pride in being the most evolved of all animals, is gradually degenerating into a beast himself. How else are we to explain the conduct of the ?spectators? who watched the scavenging of an infant instead of reaffirming their humanity by shooing away the dogs (?Cry for Calcutta?, Feb 25)? Whether the baby was alive or dead is besides the point. Shouldn?t the dead merit even a decent burial? It speaks abysmally of the humanity of one eyewitness, an old lady, that she simply ?looked? out of her window, could not bear it, and ?shut? out the sight. Another onlooker attributed his inability to act to his advanced age. What would he have done had the victim been his own grandchild? Would his age also have prevented him from rushing out to collect an autograph of a celebrity visiting the locality? 

 This incident brings into focus the number of unwanted pregnancies that end in the hapless mothers abandoning their newborn on the roadside. They and their partners should be sent to the gallows. Benevolence may not have died out of society entirely, but one such incident negates a thousand acts of charity. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sharmi Adhikary, Calcutta

 Sir ? Prasanta Ray?s comment that ?this [incident] does not necessarily mean that Calcuttans are generally inhuman? is not convincing. How can we seek to excuse our culpability by saying that the ?risk factor overweighed a more reasoned decision?? Just as we would punish a criminal, all those who look the other way are also culpable. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shaona Saha, Chandannagore

 Sir ? ?Cry for Calcutta? makes one sick to the stomach. What stopped the onlookers from chasing away the dogs? Resigned to the atrocities of political goons for the past several decades, Calcuttans seem to have lost even the strength to fight a few rowdy street dogs. Little wonder that people have accepted corruption and dishonesty in almost every aspect of life and that unscrupulous political leaders have it all their way. It is a shame for the entire state, especially the younger people. Are they the precursors of Khudiram Bose and Bagha Jatin? 

 Yours faithfully,

Kunal Saha, Columbus, US

 Sir ? It is inconceivable that something like this should happen in Calcutta. Even if the baby was dead, it is a shame that people watched the gory sight without trying to do anything. Is the legendary warmth of Calcuttans vanishing?

 Yours faithfully,

Jacqueline Gomes, Chandannagore

 Sir ? Very conveniently, we have shifted our guilt to the dogs. But dogs are not such brutes that they will scramble to eat a live baby, as has been proved by the news report, ?This time, a baby saved? (March 1). After all, dogs are well known for their good nature and sense of loyalty. The incident amply shows the degeneration that has seeped into all strata of society. The disintegration of the joint family has eroded our sense of community and our fellow feeling. Living in nuclear families, we have become self- centred. 

 Yours faithfully,

Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

 Sir ? Childline, managed by Don Bosco Ashalayam and CINI ASHA, has been operating in Calcutta for the past six years. It has a toll-free help-line, 1098, to reach out to children in distress. A phone call to this number would have saved the life of the baby. 

 Yours faithfully,

Subrata Mukherjee, Howrah

 Sir ? Calcutta, which already has one feather in its cap ? the world?s third most-polluted city ? can claim another, that of being one of the most heartless cities in the world. Also, if the parents of the baby had wanted to get rid it, they could at least have left it in front of a hospital or an orphanage, so that people could have looked after it.

 Yours faithfully,

Rimli Datta, Calcutta

 Hollywood calling

 Sir ? It was amusing to read about all the fuss being made over whether Aishwarya Rai would present an Oscar award this year (?Presenter Ash is unknown to Oscar?, Feb 26). In recent times, there have been one too many faux news items about Rai and Hollywood. She was supposed to be acting in a Bond movie and many other high-profile films, but nothing materialized. What is really amusing is that the report implies that the actress declined the golden opportunity to make a splash in Hollywood because she was busy in Britain, shooting for a film being directed by Gurinder Chaddha?s husband. At least Rai deserves an Oscar for proffessionalism, if not for her acting skills.

 Yours faithfully,

Nisha Agrawal, Calcutta

 Sir ? Like the earlier rumours about the many offers she was getting to act in Hollywood films, the one about Aishwarya Rai being a presenter at the Oscars has been proved to be false. It is really infuriating to see the public being taken for a ride by an actress out to prop up a sagging career.

 Yours faithfully,

A.K. Ghosh, Calcutta

 CAN?T GET TO SLEEP

 NEHA SAHAY

 It?s a small room, 8 feet by 10 feet, with a window looking out on a wall, but it?s home. Twenty-year-old Tse Xing has just returned from a rare shopping trip. As in India, she first offers her guest a glass of water: but in a small paper cup. She then puts away the precious stuff she?s bought ? every item a planned buy. First the room-fresheners. Like all Chinese, Tse is hung up on these cheap sickly-sweet-smelling containers. She puts one in her room, oblivious of the consequences of inhaling the chemical in a closed, small space. Another goes into her toilet down the corridor, which she is lucky not to have to share with any of the other tenants. 

 Next, the cockroach repellents are strategically placed; the small plastic wastepaper basket lined with a shopping bag; the sanitary napkins and toilet rolls tossed into the cupboard; the bananas put on the dressing-table and the left-overs from the rare lavish lunch with a foreign friend in the mini-fridge. Tse has bought only two expensive items today: a large, soft pillow: ?very comfortable?, and a face cleanser: ?very good for my freckles??. 

 For an average 20-year-old female migrant worker, Tse lives luxuriously. A TV, a mini-fridge, a cupboard, a dressing-table, a room, a toilet all to herself, and a shared kitchen, that too in the heart of town, walking distance from her workplace ? she has them all. For this little palace, which she cleans whenever she finds it looking dirty, and in which her only investment is a pedestal fan, she pays half her basic monthly salary of 1,000 yuan. 

 Lonely planet

 Tse is one of the hundreds of garment-shop assistants who clap their hands and shout loudly all day to attract customers. All Chinese towns have such shops, conveniently located in ?walking streets?. All day, working class women browse through them, tempted by the perennial discounts.

 Tse has it relatively easy; she works eight-hour shifts, and gets, apart from her salary, a commission for every item sold, one meal and dormitory accommodation, for which she needs to pay only a reasonable electricity charge. But disturbed by the merry-making of her dorm mates, who would bring boyfriends over for the night, Tse decided to stay on her own, specially because she?s one of the few who doesn?t have to send any money home. In the dorm, she used to save 700 yuan a month, stinting on food; now, she can save barely 200. 

 But sleep continues to elude Tse. Try as she might, she cannot fall asleep despite (or because of?) the jute mattress, despite hugging the giant, furry toy seal gifted by her friends. So she watches TV till the wee hours, till she simply must close her aching eyes at dawn. 

 The Chinese have notoriously bad teeth (Mao was said to have never brushed); but the bane of the current generation would surely be bad eyes, the result of watching TV for hours from a distance of less than five feet. 

 Room of her own 

 Tse spends most of her free time in this airless room, surrounded by her soft toys, picked up as prizes from rifle-shooting and ring-throwing games. She knows that if she steps out, she would end up buying something, anything, from the dazzling display all around her. She tries to study her ?Learn English? text, but it?s tough, and she has no help. She wants to go back to learning computers, but can?t motivate herself. She?d like a room mate, but of the right kind. Months of working nights in a bar have turned her system upside down. She wants to sleep but she can?t; she wants to eat but feels full quickly. 

 Lack of sleep is a common complaint among 20-something female migrants, be they lowly shop assistants, who must be on their feet eight hours a day with a break only after two weeks, or well-off computer designers who get weekly offs. Is it due to the lack of anyone older they can lean on as family?

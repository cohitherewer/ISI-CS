 FLING OPEN THE BORDERS

 Malvika Singh

 With another Saarc meeting, this time in Dhaka, behind us, we need to get rid of the woolly and predictable talk that engulfs such conclaves. If the countries concerned mean business, if these nations are committed to becoming a force to reckon with in the region, the dialogue and initiatives have to be seen to be far more serious than they have come across. Why, for instance, have they not instituted a common visa for Saarc? If Europe can have a Schengen visa, why can?t south Asia have one of its own? International travel and tourism, that generates much employment and boosts the inflow of resources, would help lift these culturally-rich and powerful countries out of the economic neglect they find themselves in. 

 This one move would cut to size the bureaucracy that has become the stumbling block to renewed friendship, economic cooperation, faith and peace in the region. India must make this a priority and see it through. Simultaneously, citizens of Saarc nations must be allowed to move freely across borders, thereby uniting the bloc. Then alone will Saarc become a force on the world stage.

 All the other ?blocs? would like to see south Asia in disarray. It suits them well as they work towards a new kind of ?exploitation?. Surely the leaders understand this obvious truth. Imagine putting a reverse set of ?sanctions? on the privileged world in cultural and creative industries that include all the new communication industries! It is the only way a semblance of equality will intrude into an otherwise unipolar world. 

 Let us reject the parochial positions that have plagued our internal relations. Let us discard what colonialism did ? divide and rule. The countries of the West, the US and Europe, are continuing to do so from their perches on the world stage. By dividing SAARC, they are relentlessly using us for their economic as well as geo-political ends.

 Free movement

 With free borders, people-to-people contact will bring the pressure required for peace and cooperation. Governments hate to ?let go? of a deep-seated sense of insecurity because they know how fragile their infrastructure is. This dominant, negative position of the state must be fought if our region is to compete with the rest of the world.

 The media can be the first to be released from this artificial bondage. There should be a free movement of newspapers, periodicals, books, and electronic uplinks between Pakistan, India and all the other countries. Intellectual exchange must be endorsed through student exchanges, faculty exchanges and suchlike. 

 Pre-partition, the newspaper Dawn was published out of Delhi as well as Karachi. To celebrate the 60th anniversary of the independence of both Pakistan and India, we should ask that newspaper to start an Indian edition or start a common newspaper under a private sector joint venture and break new ground. That media company would be addressing one quarter, if not more, of the world?s citizenry. This one enterprise could stop the suspicions forced on the people by both the governments as they conjure up theories of ?conspiracy?. All the explanations used to curtail movement between India and Pakistan have fuelled hate. Try the opposite and in a historically short time, the region will become a force to contend with.

 If the other member nations do not want to drop the visa regime for Saarc citizens, India should play a googly and do it for its borders. That one arbitrary act alone will shake the governments and the world. It is time to shift the existing paradigms and not fall to the pressure of international vested interests. By 2007, we should be able to put these difficult measures into place and make another tryst with destiny ? as the world sleeps, Saarc awakes to peace and freedom!

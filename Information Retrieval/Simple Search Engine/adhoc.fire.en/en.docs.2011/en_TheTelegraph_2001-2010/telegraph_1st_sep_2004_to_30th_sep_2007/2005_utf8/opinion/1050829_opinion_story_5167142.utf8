 NOT A GOOD START

 The finance minister had announced in his budget the introduction of a new process of monitoring government performance. Besides the traditional scrutiny of money already spent, there would be a report on expenditure before it was spent: each department would state every quarter what it had achieved with its allocation, and what it aimed to achieve. The prime minister wrote to ministries in support and asked the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission to assist. Mr P. Chidambaram can take credit that he was able to present the outcome budget for the first quarter before the second was over. But he did not look exactly proud of his new creation. He did not give any substantial statement to parliament or the media. It was almost as if he wanted the budget to be quickly forgotten.The reasons are not far to seek. For the ministries? idea of ?deliverables? turns out to be different from the common man?s. Thus, the aviation ministry counts amongst its deliverables both planes yet to be bought and the loan instalments on past purchases. The department of telecommunications reckons amongst its deliverables the telephones that Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited, theoretically independent companies, were supposed to instal. The ministry of culture plans soon to ask state governments about their Republic Day floats. Even after defining deliverables as they like, most ministries do not know what they have delivered. They have a better idea of why they will not be able to deliver. Many departments are just bluffing. For instance, the AYUSH department, which promotes indigenous medicine, has precise targets for the number of clinics to be established, the number of medical kits to be distributed, and so on. But it has no idea how many it has given out, so it talks instead about research being a continuing process and the government helping reputable institutions.

 The outcome budget covers only plan expenditure. The Planning Commission brings out a Plan Midterm Review just as the full term is about to end; the finance ministry has brought out a quarterly review of plan expenditure just as the next quarter is to end. As the finance minister said, first steps are needed to commence any journey. But he also said that the journey was a long one. The plans and the Midterm Reviews continue in their original verbose and ineffectual incarnation half a century after they commenced their journey. It is to be hoped that the outcome budget?s journey will be somewhat more brisk. With the prime minister?s authority behind him, Mr Chidambaram must ensure that ministries begin to deliver something more solid soon.

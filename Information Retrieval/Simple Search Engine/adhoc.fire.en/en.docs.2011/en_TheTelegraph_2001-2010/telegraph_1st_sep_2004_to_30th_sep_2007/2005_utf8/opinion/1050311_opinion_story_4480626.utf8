 ALL IN A DAY?S WORK

 Neha Sahay

 ?Today is March 8, so only men-folk came to work. That is thanks to Mr Mao?, read an e-mail from a Chinese executive to his foreign boss. In China, International Women?s Day is an official ?festival?. Women work half-day; some foreign companies give them a full day off. Communist Party women officials meet for special Women?s Day ?parties?; if other official engagements are scheduled, they don?t miss them, but ?celebrate their festival by performing their political duty?.

 But take this: Chen Lili, probably the first transsexual to apply to take part in any international beauty contest, declared that she would spend her first Women?s Day after her sex-change, doing the following: ?Shopping, facial, spa... I will do everything women enjoy to celebrate my first women?s festival.?

 You can?t help but notice China?s women the moment you enter the mainland. Smart, dressed in business suits, beautiful, efficient, their gaze professional, their tone courteous but business-like; (wo)manning immigration counters, ferry ports, petrol pumps, banks, buses, highway toll-points, ticket counters?they?re everywhere, at all times of day and night.

Real women

 There?s also the other kind of businesswoman that grabs your attention, whether in a hotel, the seafront or the main shopping street. Alone or in twos, smoking or laughing in the arms of a man twice her age; shockingly young, extremely provocative.

 Within 30 years of Mao?s death, women are selling themselves, and everything else. No car launch is complete without models arching their slender backs over gleaming bonnets; most restaurants have long-legged beauties in slit outfits standing outside to attract customers. In open-air cafes, mini-skirted beer-girls with trays of beer bottles slung from their necks, approach you. They must sell 100 bottles a night. Leave alone the billboards, laminated displays outside nondescript beauty salons too show semi-nude women.

 Cooking competitions for husbands are a popular event on Women?s Day. It?s not uncommon for husbands to cook. But now, more and more working women, even well-paid employees, are choosing to quit their jobs and stay home to be ?real women?. With just one child to look after, and school timings designed to cater to working parents, there?s no need for them to do so. Yet, a recent survey showed that 25 per cent of Guangdong women wanted to opt to stay home.

Stay at home

 This trend is not being discouraged by the government. Recently, a high party official raised the hackles of most of his women colleagues by suggesting at a national party conference that women should ?return home?. He said: ?staying at home and taking care of their husbands and children is also an honour for women and a part of social responsibility.?

 Two women officials replied to him. The head of a provincial arts academy rejected it, while the head of a medical college supported it. The latter wants Chinese society to ?progress? to a point where housework becomes socially recognized work ? not paid work, but valued in terms of insurance/share in property.

 The official Chinese women?s organization has been encouraging another trend: training laid-off women workers to become housemaids. The wheel?s certainly coming full circle from the time communes looked after household chores and women comrades marched alongside men. But achieving this new division of labour will take a long time. Today, all families expect their daughters to work. In villages where jobs are scarce, parents send their daughters off to unknown cities to earn a living on their own the moment they finish middle school, when they are just 15. The self-confidence begins then.

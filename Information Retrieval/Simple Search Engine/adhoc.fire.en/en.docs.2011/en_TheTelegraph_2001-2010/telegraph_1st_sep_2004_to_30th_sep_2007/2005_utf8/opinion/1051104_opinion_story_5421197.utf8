 HEAD?S TALES

 - More Seth Goonda than Seth Golmal

 Temporary life

 WARRIOR OF THE FOURTH ESTATE: Ramnath Goenka of the Express 

 By B.G. Verghese, Viking, Rs 450

 George Verghese?s gripping tale unwittingly demolishes two powerful myths. First, that Indira Gandhi went on a lawless rampage during the Emergency. Second, that Ramnath Goenka, striding the worlds of business, politics and the media, was a fearless crusader for press freedom.

 Verghese has written not just about the man who K.P. Unnikrishnan, an indefatigable critic, called ?Seth Golmal?, and Bombay municipality eulogized as ?Freedom Fighter Ramnath Goenka?. This is about an institution and, even more, a stirring period in Indian history. It?s an enjoyable book, but the political purpose beneath the sparkle would have gained credibility if the author had not been so coy about his own stake. He is, by all accounts, a decent man whom his Times of India colleagues knew as ?Boy Scout.? Goenka called him a saint, adding, ?But saints should be sitting in the Vatican!? Yet, neither the text nor the potted CV admits that far from being a detached chronicler, Verghese was a player, albeit with a bit part, in the turbulent political drama that convulsed India in the late Seventies.

 When Goenka bankrolled the apostle of civil rights, Jayaprakash Narayan, to marshal the great and the good, Verghese, too, threw his hat into the ring and stood for parliament as an independent supported by the Janata Party and communists from Mavelikara in Kerala. Morarji Desai would undoubtedly have found him a ministerial berth had he won.

 Similarly, Verghese tells us that when Unnikrishnan was marrying a Rajasthani girl, Goenka sent her an expensive sari with his sympathies, but omits to mention that Amrita Unnikrishnan returned the gift. Many other examples of suppressio veri suggestio falsi do not detract from reading pleasure but do blur the line between entertainment and propaganda.

 Inevitably, the author is sometimes hoist with his own petard. What the many illuminating instances of how Goenka and others repeatedly and brilliantly worsted Mrs Gandhi?s Emergency dictatorship really reveal is that she was willing to be bound by rules that she recognized as greater than her dispensation. One example will suffice. The tale of how she packed the Indian Express board with her minions has been told often enough. Verghese records that Goenka simply sacked the lot and seized back his paper when the Gandhi gang overlooked the technical formality of getting shareholders to ratify the coup within a stipulated time. A prime minister who is so easily foiled can hardly have been the vicious and vindictive ogress of freedom-fighter mythology.

 I.K. Gujral, a liberal who risked much under Mrs Gandhi, called Seth Golmal the ?personified negation? of press freedom. Forget the self-serving legends woven by Goenka?s cronies and henchmen. Remember instead how he changed editors like soiled socks, fomented quarrels (?creative tension?) among them, made and unmade policy over their heads, intrigued with ostensible adversaries and used his papers to push his interests. No wonder reports in what used to be called the ?jute press? were taken with a pinch of salt, especially when proprietorial investments were involved. Manmohan Singh may have recalled this when he warned recently that ?the convergence of corporate interests and the control that market men have come to acquire on editorial policy can militate against pluralism and even the freedom of the press.? One editor Goenka sacked reflected that ?the Indian press can serve the great public of India adequately only if the professional pride and integrity of journalists are strengthened.?

 To be fair to Verghese, he does not mince words about the bullying and bludgeoning that should have inspired Unnikrishnan to speak of Seth Goonda rather than Seth Golmal. But the hagiographic framework suggests these are only the warts that set off a perfect complexion. In contrast, he goes hammer and tongs against the other side.

 Verghese mentions Goenka?s practice of lunching with his editors at the office in Delhi. ?Trends would be analysed and gossip purveyed to ribald comment and laughter.? Invited to one such meal, I was amused to find Goenka?s editors, heroes of journalism and household names every man jack of them, sitting in petrified silence like schoolboys while the boss held forth overpoweringly from the head of the table. Since I was a visitor to the Express durbar, Goenka courteously addressed his ribaldry ? mainly at Mrs Gandhi?s expense ? to me. He also said his name for me was ?Bhakta?. Since we hadn?t met before, I was taken aback that he was even aware of my existence, leave alone have a name for me. ?Mr Goenka reads the Observer?, one of his editors whispered in explanation, referring to the British Sunday paper for which I wrote. It turned out that the ?Bhakta? appellation referred to my assessment the previous Sunday that Mrs Gandhi would be returned to power in the 1980 polls which had just been called. The prediction did not please.

 Verghese has written an eminently readable book in spite of repetition (the connection with Shreyans Prasad Jain is explained three times), overlapping and infelicities like ?fallen apart? for ?fallen out? and Mr Pickwick when he means another Dickens character, Mr Micawber. He compares his subject with ruthless larger-than-life media barons like William Randolph Hearst, Lord Beaverbrook and Rupert Murdoch, but rightly indicates that Goenka?s power lust was also tempered with flashes of endearing mischief as well as humanity. Witness the episode of the girls to whom he gave a lift and then treated to idlis and dosas. However, this is not personal biography; the man remains hidden in the politician, and we still don?t know who ghosted for him.

 He became a legend in his lifetime, and by commissioning Verghese to write this biography, his lineal and professional heirs are trying to ensure that the legend endures. It will for a time but, as Goenka himself observed with the cynicism of someone who knew everyone?s price and was willing to pay it, even a dead son is forgotten after the eleventh day. It may not have been so if Seth Golmal Ramnath Goenka had contributed more substance and less sensation to India?s public discourse.

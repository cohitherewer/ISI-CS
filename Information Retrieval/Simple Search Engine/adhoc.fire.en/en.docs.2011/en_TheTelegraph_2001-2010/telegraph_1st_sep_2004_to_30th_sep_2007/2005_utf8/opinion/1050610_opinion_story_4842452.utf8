 Paperback Pickings

 Harems, he-goats and other vices

 A strange attachment and other stories (Rupa, Rs 195) by Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay is Phyllis Granoff?s translation of this Bengali master?s short fiction for the UNESCO Indian Series. Granoff is aware of the simplicity and mellifluousness of Bibhutibhushan?s Bengali, which is nevertheless beautifully sensitive to nuances of longing, disappointment and pain, and the myriad shades of everyday life, mostly in rural Bengal. But some of her decisions are dodgy, and make too many compromises for the sake of making Bandyopadhyay accessible to the ?Western reader?. ?Cultural details? are ?explained? by inserting a line or phrase in the main text in order to avoid footnotes; repetitions in Bengali are cut down and variety introduced to avoid ?an unnatural monotony?; differences in linguistic register are flattened out; and some passages, like religious homilies, are shortened because they ?would have sounded more like over-kill than old friends to a Western reader?. Some readers might not go all the way in accepting Granoff?s attempts at creating a globalized Bibhutibhushan for the United Nations. Numerous typos throughout.

 Defining dignity: an anthology of dreams, hopes and struggles (Heinrich B?ll Foundation, Rs 300) edited by Mukul Sharma and Sana Das collects essays, poems, plays, photographs and paintings to forge a ?philosophical, experiential, regionalised and yet universal discourse? on dignity. It describes its own contents as ?earnest out pourings on Iraq, Palestine, textile mill workers, women, Dalits?. The ?struggle? in the title will be re-enacted by the reader as he works his way through this book?s ?discourse?. This is Rada Ivekovic writing on nationhood and women: ?In this sense, the ?sexuation?, which is also a naturalization or an essentialism, is principally an instrumentalisation for the purpose of appropriation and of the reproduction of the identical.?

 Mangal pandey (Penguin, Rs 150) by Rudrangshu Mukherjee is subtitled ?Brave Martyr or Accidental Hero??. It is a slim monograph, born out of reading and research done on the 1857 revolt over the last twenty-five years, and ?came from my head and off my shelves?, as the author describes in his acknowledgements. Mangal Pandey, the man who single-handedly started the 1857 Uprising, ?has no curriculum vitae to put up to the board of history. He could have preserved this anonymity, like innumerable other sepoys, had he not shot at his superior officers in Barrackpore. His was an unexpected intrusion into history.? The myths and facts about Pandey are made to ?configure in the narrative of a bigger event, the uprising of 1857?, which is, in turn, ?made part of an even bigger narrative, the history of India?s freedom struggle?. There is an updated bibliography and excerpts from documents on Pandey?s trial.

 Private life of the mughals of india (1526-1803 a.d.) (Rupa, Rs 295) by R. Nath is about a ?little known, but much scandalised? subject. Chapters on the following: the Mughal harem, the ladies of the Mughal harem, Rajput wives of the Mughals, administration of the Mughal harem, kitchen, dining etiquette and cuisine, perfumes and incenses, addictions and intoxicants, aphrodisiacs (testes of the he-goat boiled in milk), amusements and pastimes, paraphernalia, and daily routines. It is rather scrappily written. Nath, unlike the Mughals, classifies sodomy, as a ?sex vice?, and believes that it ?originated in the desert?, and is a ?pre-Islamic vice of the Arab society?.

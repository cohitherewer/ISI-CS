 READY FOR TRUTH?

 Gwynne Dyer

 ?Now that I am in this crazy fervour of mine/ I could do just about anything/ So your stupid, rotten, vain souls/ Wouldn?t stare at me with their stupid peaceful eyes? ? Radovan Karadzic. Leader of the Bosnian Serbs during the 1992-95 attempt to cleanse the areas where they were a majority of all other ethnic groups, destroy Bosnia and unite with Serbia, Karadzic is a rotten poet, but his recently published volume of poetry shows that, after ten years as a fugitive, he is still filled with rage and hate. Unfortunately, so is the Bosnian state he tried to destroy.

 Things have been looking up recently in the ?west Balkans? ? as the space occupied by Albania and the remains of former Yugoslavia is known. The prospect of eventual EU membership has drawn the successor states to reforms that are gradually transforming them from chaotic post-communist autocracies into democratic states. Slovenia was actually admitted to the EU last year, and the others are rapidly joining the queue.

 Bosnia, however, is bringing up the rear, mainly because of the devastation inflicted on the country by the Balkan wars that began when Slobodan Milosevic, an ultra-nationalist Serb, achieved near-dictatorial powers in Belgrade and launched his project to unite all the Serbs of former Yugoslavia within one country. There was no fighting in Serbia itself, but Croatia, with a small Serb minority, endured years of war, and Bosnia, with 40 per cent Serbs, was almost destroyed.

 Separate entities

 By 1995, when international intervention and a Nato bombing campaign against Serbia ended the slaughter in Bosnia, a quarter-million of its 4.5 million people were dead and almost half homeless. Even now only a half-million of the two million refugees have dared to return to their homes, and the country?s GDP is only 60 per cent of what it was when fighting began. At the current rate of growth, it will not return to the 1992 level until 2015.

 The reason for slow growth is the peace agreement that was more or less imposed on the local factions by the United States of America in 1995. It stopped the fighting, but at the cost of carving the county into two ?entities?, one for the Serbs who had been responsible for most of the atrocities, and the other a shotgun marriage of Croats and Muslims in Bosnia (who had also been fighting each other).

 Carrot and stick

 The old, ethnically integrated Bosnia is gone forever: every municipality save one has a population that is 90 per cent or more from a single ethnic or religious group. But EU membership is a great carrot, and Brussels and the US are both using that prospect to push Bosnian leaders into a new constitution that would strengthen the central government greatly at the expense of the ethnically defined entities.

 Since most of Bosnia?s politicians have strictly ethnic political bases, it?s a bit like asking turkeys to vote for Christmas. But last week, at a meeting to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the peace accords, Condoleezza Rice extracted a commitment from Bosnian leaders to create a single presidency and strengthen the central government by next March. The EU also rewarded them by agreeing to open talks on an association agreement ? and the two separate ?entities? have already agreed to integrate their separate armies next year. Genuine reconciliation is still a long way off though.

 As Lord Paddy Ashdown, who leaves Bosnia this January after three-and-a-half years as the international community?s High Representative, recently said, ?The major burden of guilt is on them [the Serbs], and they have to acknowledge it, just as the Germans acknowledged it....I don?t think Bosnia is ready for reconciliation, but I do think it is ready for truth.?

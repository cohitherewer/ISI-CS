 SORRY, WRONG NUMBER

 Dipankar Das

 The BPO industry is in the eye of yet another storm. Union leaders have been eyeing this sector for some time now to bolster their faltering ranks. M.S. Pandhe, the Citu leader, even crossed swords with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on the need to bring this constituency under the leftist union?s control.

 Now, close on the heels of these developments, comes a report compiled by the V.V. Giri Institute of Labour Studies, that likens Indian call centre workers to Roman slaves. It compares working conditions in call centres to those of a Roman galley, and says that call centre workers are exposed to the whiplashes of nocturnal work, lethal stress and pre-industrial work practices, which reduce the quality of their life. The report even calls BPO workers ?cyber coolies?.

 However, both the union leaders and those who have penned the report may need to change their perceptions to understand this industry better. In the past, one industry or the other has been the darling of the money-spewing bourses. In the 18th century it was the shipping industry, while a hundred years later, it was coalmining. The software industry has been a darling as far as day traders are concerned. It is likely that the BPO industry will make the software industry an also-ran soon enough. 

 On the rise

 BPOs today employ less than half a million people directly and each job-opening is believed to create three ancillary jobs. But what is more interesting is the rate at which the industry is growing. It has a compounded annual growth rate of 50 per cent and the potential for further growth is immense. The industry employs mostly young people, often directly from colleges. 

 With a five figure starting salary, one job offer a month, free transport and food, India?s educated youngsters have come a long way from the days when a failure in engineering and medical exams spelt doom for their careers. This constituency is unlikely to heed the clarion call of the unions. Any sense of identification with day labourers toiling around boilers does not even remotely figure in the BPO workers? worst nightmare.

 Unions have also been presumptuous in assuming BPO executives as an exploited lot. This is far from the truth. Indian universities may be churning out graduates by the millions, but English-speaking graduates with the capability to work seamlessly with a global workforce and willing to start their careers in call centres, are not that numerous. The industry already has a phenomenal 60 per cent attrition rate, as BPO companies desperately angle for the same set of people, who, in turn, are laughing all the way to the bank. 

 Sea change

 BPOs are even signing bilateral no-poaching agreements to stem the outflow of executives. Hence, unfortunately for the unions and those who pen reports without first hand knowledge, some of the world?s most employee-friendly human resource practices are being practised in this industry to woo and retain employees.

 The nature of the BPO industry itself is undergoing a radical change. Some of the best Mumbai law firms are now working for swish legal outfits based in New York and getting paid top dollar. European design houses are migrating high-end products to India, while Fortune 500 companies are increasingly relying on Indian firms to do data modelling, gather business intelligence and help them take the next big investment step in Dow using sophisticated software applications.

 Thus, the unions are on a wild goose chase. Unless, of course, they are able to organize white-collar unions, customized for the BPO sector, with monthly meetings slated in local discotheques to discuss issues such as triple digit increments.

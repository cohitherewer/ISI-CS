 HOME, NEW HOME

 With some more hard work, the Upper Krishna Project?s success with resettlement could be replicated in other states, writes Bishnupada Sethi

 Almatti dam: in all earnestness

 The national policy on rehabilitation and resettlement, announced by the National Democratic Alliance in February 2004, did not fulfil expectations. Hopefully, things will be different under the United Progressive Alliance. But more than a policy, what is important is to have a proper, sensitized mechanism to handle the implementation issues. Under the initiative of the United Nations development programme, Orissa is trying to formulate a rehabilitation and resettlement policy with precisely this purpose. 

 Today, the argument that a few might have to sacrifice for the greater good of society is no longer acceptable. The mere announcement of a development project now sees unrest. This is because of the bitter memories of the thousands who have suffered in the last five decades because of giant development projects. India has had very few successful resettlement programmes, unlike in China or Indonesia. In this context, the Upper Krishna Irrigation Project, rated successful by the World Bank, has lessons to offer.

 Karnataka took up the Upper Krishna Irrigation Project in 1962. The project has displaced 80,000 families in the four districts of Belgaum, Bijapur, Gulbarga and Raichur. The resettlement is distinctly divided into two phases, one prior to 1995 and another afterwards. The programme, started in 1978, moved gradually. By 1979, only 7 per cent of the land had been acquired, 12 per cent compensation paid, and 12 per cent of the resettlement villages completed for the submersible areas of Narayanpur reservoir. 

 By 1986, only 2,925 families had been resettled. The compensation paid was quite inadequate. About 80 to 90 per cent of the people failed to buy replacement land and continued with the cultivation of their original land after the water receded in winter. The World Bank took note of this and in its letter to the government in 1992 wrote, ?The prevailing R amp;R situation demonstrates that the government of Karnataka is in breach of the spirit and letter of the several covenants of the project/legal agreements?. The bank suspended disbursement in November 1992 and again in September 1995 when the situation did not improve. 

 The project saw a dramatic turnaround after 1995 under S.M. Jaamdar, the new commissioner, revenue and land acquisition, Upper Krishna Project. He effected an all-round improvement in the construction of houses for the displaced, and payment of ex-gratia relief and grants. The consent award system was introduced for payment of compensation; price advisory committees were appointed, consisting of representatives of affected people and their MLAs, along with six other officials. These committees fixed reasonable market rates for different kinds of lands ? Rs 60,000 for dry land and one lakh rupees for wet land per acre. Besides, the farmers got compensation for loss of trees, crops and houses at par with the real market value or more.

 Ten years after the government decided to make it a success, the Upper Krishna Project is rated as one of the best in the world on resettlement activities. Significant improvements were made possible due to certain built-in safeguards for the displaced, and most certainly the establishment of a completely independent authority under the leadership of the commissioner. This is unlike what happened prior to 1995, when the irrigation department was itself in charge of resettlement activities, and subordinated them to irrigation priorities. The political will is evident from the fact that the commissioner has not been transferred for a decade, despite the change of governments. 

 Other factors that have worked in favour of the displaced are an appropriate legal framework, comprehensive planning, an efficient information system, space for participation of the affected people, a sufficient and independent budget and a positive approach to development.

 Adoption of the consent award method was probably the turning point for the Upper Krishna Project. It gave people sufficient money to buy land in the command areas, improve their remaining land by sinking bore wells or take up other economic activities. From being adversaries of the development, people became friends of the development process. 

 Today the new town of Bagalkot has come up for the displaced. The infrastructure and civic facilities are one of the best in the country. No wonder, the people to be displaced later are demonstrating for quicker displacement and rehabilitation. One of the most important factors was cultural rehabilitation of the submerged civilization and promotion of tourism to further employment generation in the area.The cultural complex at new Bagalkot town is a unique creation which aims at preserving monuments and customs. Under the chairmanship of the director of archaeology and museums, materials of historical importance such as inscriptions, sculptures and objects pertaining to the fine arts, performing arts and so on from 200 villages have been preserved. The cultural complex of Bagalkot showcases the unique customs and lifestyle, the colourful festivals and occupations that the people of these villages follow. 

 Restoration of the Sangameswara temple, situated in one of the submergence villages, is an important work. The temple attracts a lot of devotees from the neighbouring states. To overcome resistance from the local people, the authorities of the Upper Krishna Project decided to renovate the temple in the same place. The work was undertaken at the cost of Rs 43.58 crore. 

 The project authority has taken up the task of beautification of the area near the Almatti dam. Artificial lakes, and several parks with different themes have added a new dimension to the resettlement activities. The place is fast emerging as an important destination for tourists, promising employment to more than a few thousand families.

 The lessons from the Upper Krishna Project were learnt the hard way. The families who were the first to get displaced paid heavy prices for development and continue to languish in poverty. Things turned out to be better in the second phase primarily because of the government?s willingness to do justice to resettlement matters and to think holistically. The no-nonsense approach of the administrative machinery is now evident from the sign-board at the Bagalkot guest house which says, ?Political meetings are prohibited here.?

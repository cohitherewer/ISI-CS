 Letters to Editor

 Trial by fire

 Sir ? In addition to holding an investigation into the fire that killed the animals in the Russian circus, there must also be an investigation into how the circus imported these animals into India and why they were allowed to use them for four months in a breach of Indian laws (?21 animals killed in circus ?, April 5). There is plenty of evidence to show that animals suffer greatly in circuses, and this circus in particular was at the centre of controversies before it even arrived in India. The horrific deaths are proof that animals should be banned in circuses in India. 

 Yours faithfully,

Craig Redmond, Preston, UK

 Speech therapy

 Sir ? I could not agree with Andr? B?teille more about the Indian habit of ?Speaking and writing? (April 7). During my long academic and administrative experience, I have read millions of words, of which at least half were simply unreadable. To add to the problem, most of the books published today are brought out by publishers who are unprofessional, and thus have innumerable errors. Thanks to the unholy alliance between publishers, librarians and authors, whose career prospects depend upon the number of their publications and not their quality, the system flourishes. Surprisingly, even an elite university like Jawaharlal Nehru University asks for the number of books and articles published in its faculty position applications. There is no mechanism of peer review of quality. No wonder the majority of scholarly writings these days are coming from outside the university system.

Yours faithfully, 

Partha S. Ghosh, Guwahati 

 Sir ? Andr? B?teille points to certain obvious points, without qualifying them. There is no doubt that Indians are poor listeners. This habit in part stems from an ostrich mentality ? that is to be in a perpetual denial mode so that one?s fallacies are not pointed out. There is also the not-so-well-concealed arrogance. Most Indians claim to be patriots, and their love for the country is displayed by criticizing and ridiculing foreigners. Not once is the criticism directed at oneself. But if we do not keep our eyes and ears open to learn from the mistakes of others and improve upon the successes of others while acknowledging our own drawbacks, how do we progress? Perhaps we need to recall what Mahatma Gandhi said, ?I do not want my house to be walled in on all sides and my windows to be stuffed. I want the cultures of all lands to be blown about my house as freely as possible.? 

 Yours faithfully,

Aruni Mukherjee, Coventry, UK

 Sir ? In India, people who write in English do so for the sole reason that they want their work to be published. Such qualities as precision, discipline and brevity are hurdles people sidestep in their quest for instant fame. The beauty of the language escapes our writing in much the same way that it escapes our thinking. 

 But if we are a nation of bad writers, we are a far more depraved nation of readers. Though a book?s merit is a relative question, Indians, in general, cannot even distinguish between a book that is readable and one that is not. We are unable to make this simple distinction because we do not read enough, and the situation seems to be getting worse. The flaws in our reading habits spill over into our writing. At the individual level, we can make amends by starting to read more books. With time, we may be able to choose good books to read and adopt better styles of writing. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shiladitya Chetia, Guwahati

 Sir ? If B?teille finds Indians long-winded in their speech and writing, the academia, to which he himself belongs, is partly to blame for this.

 Yours faithfully,

Jayanta Halder, Calcutta

 LIVING SIDE BY SIDE

 Malvika Singh

 Eid mubarak, and it falls this time on Juma, a Friday, which is very special, very auspicious. For north India, Eid is a familiar festival where we look forward to the best early morning nihari, hot and delicious, served in the many eateries around Juma Masjid, and much feasting at the evening iftars. Islamic and Sufi traditions have, over time, become a part of the lives of most of us who live in this part of the world. India absorbs well and the best of cuisine, craftsmanship, music, dance poetry and philosophy have permeated the living ethos of the country. Over time the different strains have blended into the landscape blurring the sharp edges. Every faith and creed has had the same experience on the soil of Hindustan. The ability to accept and to give is what makes this subcontinent stand apart. Polarization and static positions are what destroy the great mixing, another form of a manthan.

 Rigidity has never been an Indian attribute. We are flexible as a people and hugely tolerant. We have tolerated the betrayal of our political leaders. We have tolerated corruption that has overwhelmed all aspects of work, life and living. We have tolerated discrimination based on caste, creed and faith meted out by those who rule us. We have tolerated a myriad horrors without forcing a bloody revolution, the like of which many nations have had to live through. Credit for this ?peace? goes to Indians across the land. Their inner strength comes from the ability to absorb, question, think, give the benefit of the doubt. Yes, we are laid back only because we know, through experience and exposure, that the patience of a long distance runner usually pays off.

 Beyond bonds

 When the privileged, those in power, disturb this fine balance for short-term gains, they are in fact destroying the priceless treasure of India. As the keepers of the nation, they are allowing an amoral invasion into the body politic that is corroding the psyche of the nation. Slogans and rhetoric have become the hallmark of political activity. ?Promises? are made without thinking through the complex issues that could arise. Quick fix is the new wonder drug used by those who determine our futures. That is the sad truth.

 There is much that has to be unravelled before correctives can be introduced. Wrong and incompetent decisions that pertain to the norms we are compelled to live by as well as policies that structure our lives and work need to be addressed, debated in the public arena, restructured and brought into play. For example, it is unacceptable that some colonial British acts and laws continue to rule free India. The white burra sahib has been replaced by the brown burra sahib who is heaping indignities on his own...this has to change. Why are none of these obvious issues on any political CMP?

 We have lost a great deal both in tangibles and in time. Our ecological balance has been ruthlessly assaulted and continues to be, under the garb of righting the wrongs meted out to specific sections of society. Our urban space has been polluted. Our skills have been diluted through rampant neglect. The state has pervaded all our lives, all aspects, each nook and cranny, suffocating energy and enterprise. The incompetence of the state has made it dictatorial and unbending. It has stagnated all new thinking and initiative by imposing itself on one and all.

 We have to break loose from this bondage and energize this land that is raring to move on. The ?powerful? of today are terrified by this latent potential of a vibrant force that could sweep them, the few, into oblivion. It makes them rule with a regressive and destructive hand. As their space shrinks, as the international demands change, as another generation aspires to a new life and ethic, these men and women are becoming irrelevant and soon, inconsequential.

 YOU HAVE IT OR YOU DON?T

 Naresh Kumar

 The press has exhausted all superlatives and one journalist has even described Sania Mirza?s recent victory at the $140,000 WTA Hyderabad Open as being ?as significant as Newton?s theory of gravity?. After all that, what more can one say about Sania? It was, indeed, a stunning performance. In one fell swoop, Sania had breached the 100 barrier in the ATP rankings. Her year-end target had been achieved in a matter of weeks. 

 From all the pandemonium and deafening applause in the crammed stadium, the real Sania emerged. The frail, feminine fist with which she egged herself on masked an unyielding, fighting heart. Even when she was under pressure, she went for her shots and never resorted to patting the ball back, hoping for the opponent to make a mistake. 

 To top this all came the final, most trying test when she thought she had won the match with a service ace which was called a let. Down on her knees, arms akimbo, her first ATP title in her grip, Sania saw the title cruelly snatched away by a let call, and went on to lose the game! Such a happening would have unsettled some of the most experienced players. But Sania, all 18 years of her, composed herself and came back strongly to win the title. In tennis, one can teach backhands and forehands, serve and volley, and improve movements and fitness but no one can give you courage or a fighting heart. Either you have it or you don?t.

 Fighting heart

 Sania has it. It is an essential ingredient at the top levels of the game. I am not saying that Sania has broken through to the top. She has a long way to go. Punishing schedules, intense coaching and participation in tournaments by themselves are not enough. There has to be a balance. Sania is not built like the Amazons who dominate women?s tennis. Her training schedules have to be at a different level and spaced out over a longer period of time. The current technique of open stance trunk-twisting forehands, two-handed backhands, the hammer action service motion, have changed the bio-mechanics of the game. The smooth, sweet rhythm of old techniques has been swept aside by crude force. 

 Modern tennis is a brutal game. The rallies are longer and the shots so deep and close to the lines that you have to cover much more distance between shots. The knees, ankles and leg muscles receive a merciless pounding on the hard surface while your body is constantly contorted into unnatural postures. Without exception, the top men and women are carrying some injury or another. Staying free of injury and yet achieving the levels of skill and physical strength is going to be the challenge.

 The right balance

 While aiming for the summit, one must not ignore the signals of the body. Sania has to move with extreme caution and listen as much to her body as her coaches and trainers. Western physical trainers and coaches are used to working with stronger and more robust physiques. Sania has to be patient and firm in her stand and not be pushed into doing more than her physique can tolerate. The tennis landscape is littered with broken-down greats in their early twenties. Hingis, Venus Williams, Justine Henin-Hardenne, Jennifer Capriati are only the tip of the iceberg. So many promising youngsters must have fallen by the wayside.

 Another significant aspect of Sania?s tennis is the impact her success will have on the social fabric. Who could imagine that a young girl from a cloistered and traditional background, praying five times a day, would wear a mini skirt, pump a fist and win an ATP tournament? What Sania has shown to her generation is that it is possible to retain old world values of prayer and morals and yet be an achiever and participate at par in today?s world.

 SPOILING THE PARTY

 Raju Mukherji

 Is it the coach?s job to vitiate the atmosphere in the dressing room or is it to create an ambience of commitment, motivation and encourage ment? If the former is the right path, then Greg Chappell has hit the bullseye. But if the latter trend is the desired route, then he has fallen far short of expectations.

 To begin with, the Indian coach created such a vicious environment in the dressing room that a gentleman like V.V.S. Laxman is on record saying that he found it difficult to know where he stood. Then again, India?s most successful captain ever, Sourav Ganguly, was allegedly asked by the coach to step down. On either count, the coach went far beyond his terms of reference.

 Who has given Greg Chappell the audacity to decide on who plays and who does not? Is he acting as an agent of some petty minds? These are the obvious questions that would readily come to the mind of cricket lovers in India. 

 Wrong choice

 Three months ago, when it was pointed out in this column that Chappell was the wrong choice, one could not imagine that he would stoop to this level. His unsportsmanlike conduct on field is well known ? he was the captain who instructed his younger brother, Trevor Chappell, to roll the ball along the ground in contravention of the norms of cricket. 

 Chappell?s bio-data as a cricket coach is not too impressive either. Under his tutelage, South Australia fared disastrously in the Australian domestic cricket championships. He was axed as Pakistan?s batting coach just after one month and his offers to tutor the Australian side have been ignored. Now after losses to Sri Lanka and New Zealand in two one-day championships, Chappell has maintained his poor record.

 Cricket has long been regarded as a gentleman?s game, as cricketers would not only obey the laws of the game but also follow the code of conduct associated with it. Men like Frank Worrell, Keith Miller, Denis Compton, Garfield Sobers, Gundappa Vishwanath, Mark Taylor and others have upheld the glorious tradition over the years. But in the early Seventies, Australian players like Ian and Greg Chappell, Rodney Marsh, Dennis Lillee and Tony Greig of England brought about an unfortunate trend in cricket. Uncouth manners and the use of foul words on field came to be considered as signs of the ?killer instinct? of macho men. A free-for-all conduct was not only condoned but highly appreciated. 

 Conspiracy theorist

 Cricket has lost its charm. The days of flannels and blazers are long over. The apparel, the manners, the language ? everything has changed. Even making money by selling national interest has become fashionable and players from all over the globe are involved in this. In the retribution that followed allegations of match-fixing, some have been lucky to escape, others have been given protection. Only a few have got caught. 

 And now Greg Chappell has begun a new trend in cricket coaching. Never before was a coach known to over-rule selectors and cause dissensions within a team. A coach discouraging his own players is equally rare. Chappell?s actions have given rise to a very important query: are coaches in the grip of lobbies and conspirators?

 It may be pointed out that the Indian coach happens to be related to Victor Richardson (Chappell?s maternal grandfather). Richardson, an Australian Test player, had ragged and needled Donald Bradman out of sheer jealousy. He was, of course, patently unsuccessful and retired a frustrated man. It seems that Chappell has inherited similar traits. It remains to be seen if he too is as unsuccessful in irritating Indian players as his grand- father was during Bradman?s time.

 Letters to Editor

 A house for the leader

 Sir ? The order passed by the Supreme Court to ?throw out? the 465-odd VIPs illegally occupying government accommodation only shows that though these individuals belong to different political parties, they have no differences when it comes to flouting the laws of the land and take undue advantage of their status or connections (?Squatter VIPs face eviction?, Oct 25). The intentions of the Supreme Court are perfectly noble, but does the administration have the guts to carry out the order? This could well be an acid test for the United Progressive Alliance government. Let us hope the compulsions of coalition politics do not stand in the way of the eviction of a few VIPs.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? Given the recent revelations about ?squatter VIPs? in New Delhi, it is ironic that only the other day, many of these important people, led by the Lok Sabha speaker, were voicing their displeasure at the ?activism? of the Supreme Court undermining the prestige and dignity of parliament. The Bhagavad Gita has it that ordinary men follow what great men practice. How, then, can Indians be expected to be an honest and law-abiding people when our governors, MPs and political leaders set quite the opposite examples. The Supreme Court, true to its tradition, has once again emerged as the conscience-keeper to the nation. 

 But it is not enough that these freeloaders are evicted forthwith; they must be made to pay for the undue benefits they enjoyed. The officials responsible for the allotment of these houses must also be made to explain why timely action was not initiated against these leaders. And also why Harkishen Singh Surjeet of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) ? a party which always makes much of probity in public life ? and Congress party secretaries were at all allowed to occupy houses earmarked for MPs and ministers. 

 Yours faithfully,

P.K. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? The Supreme Court?s verdict 

 points to the failure of the official machinery of India. 

 It is the taxpayer who is bearing the brunt of this failure: 

 the substantial monthly rent at market prices that these 

 government lodgings would fetch, as well as the cost of 

 providing free accommodation to people who are not entitled 

 to it, ultimately comes from the taxpayers? pockets. 

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir ? There should be a rule for the allotment of official bungalows to these VIPs, that in case they own a residential house in the place of their service, no official residence will be allotted to them. If they build or buy a house later, they shall be required to immediately vacate the government accommodation. There are a good number of VIPs who have their own houses but still find it difficult to let go of the official bungalows. 

 Yours faithfully,

Mahesh Kapasi, New Delhi

 Sir ? The Supreme Court has been quite outspoken in the recent past on a number of issues. The order to the Centre to throw out illegal occupants of government bungalows and flats is another landmark judgment. The fact that ministers and important public figures have been reaping the benefits of unauthorized allotments is yet another proof of their irresponsible behaviour and unaccountability to the public. India has become a country where scams are the norm rather than the exception. The Centre should come up with reasonable explanations before the next hearing on November 16 instead of being a sitting duck on this issue. And then, the law should take its course.

 Yours faithfully,

Koyel Basu, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is unfortunate that the Supreme Court has had to give a strict ruling about the overstay in and illegal occupation of government bungalows, when the eviction should have been the function of the executive, which often criticizes the judiciary for overstepping its jurisdiction. Overstaying in or illegally occupying government flats is merely one of the many misdemeanours of our VIPs. They regularly default in paying rent, electricity bills, telephone charges, and so on. Those who talk about democracy in this milieu are fooling themselves.

 Yours faithfully,

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? Our ever-warring politicians are strangely united when it comes to using their power and position for the wrong things. This is why the ruling party leaders are keen on overlooking the malpractices of rival politicians. Why can?t they follow the example set by the former MP, Shabana Azmi, who vacated her government bungalow just before she left for attending the Rajya Sabha for the last time? Even in Britain, 10 Downing Street is vacated by the outgoing prime minister immediately after the new prime minister takes over. The Union and state governments must get government-accommodations vacated forcibly by throwing furniture and household items on the road if the occupiers fail to vacate these after demitting office. These leaders should also not be allowed to contest elections till they clear the dues generated by their overstay in government bungalows.

 In a country where a sizeable population lives in jhuggis or without proper shelter, there is no reason why former politicians, even former presidents, prime ministers, chief ministers should be allowed to occupy official accommodation. 

 Yours faithfully,

Subhash C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir ? Why did the Supreme Court mention Buta Singh?s name name and not that of the Uttar Pradesh chief minister, Mulayam Singh Yadav, in its list of politicians, performing artists and journalists who are illegally occupying government houses? Is it because Yadav pays a monthly rent of Rs 1.57 lakh for a bungalow whose actual rent is nearly Rs 6 lakh? The government is no longer in a financial position to dole out illegal subsidies to politicians or to anybody else. Now we know why, when politicians bring charges of corruption against the ruling party, it is a case of the pot calling the kettle black.

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

 Sir ? The government should charge rent from the VIPs who have used government bungalows beyond their tenure at market rates for the period of overstay. In fact, the government should also charge interest from these individuals who have minted money from careers in social service. The government must be proactive, for public interest litigations are not the solution to this problem. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Suman Barthakur, Guwahati

 STANDING UP TO THE WAVES

 Tsunami: 7 Hours That Shook the World By Satinder Bindra, HarperCollins amp; The India Today Group, Rs 395

 December 26, 2004 ? yuletide hangover still lingered over peninsular south India when the tsunami struck. In this volume, Satinder Bindra, who was part of CNN steam covering the calamity mainly in Sri Lanka, purports to offer a personal dimension to the ?instantly globalized grief? that followed the waves. 

 He explores untapped nuances in the narrative of this apocalyptic disaster, and, in so doing, comes up with stories of miracles. These potentially bring to life the process of rebuilding in these dead islands. 

 Readers are told about nine-year-old Tharesh Liyanage in Galle (southern Sri Lanka) who outsmarted the killer waves and mustered enough commonsense not to drink the water mixed with leaked chemicals. 

 Similarly, Rohan Rawanapura, a forensic pathologist in Galle who fingerprinted and took DNA samples of over 700 bodies in record time, has strong claims to being called a legend.

 No less stunning is the ?baby-81? episode, which involved a four-month-old infant at Kalmunai (in eastern Sri Lanka) who was recovered from a garbage vat and admitted to a local hospital as the 81st patient on that day. Despite the ensuing wrangle over parenthood, baby Abhilash ?was catapulted to the status of a local icon, symbolizing the region?s grief in general and immense suffering of children?. 

 A halo of myth surrounds the mangled body of the train, ?Queen of the Sea?, which was tossed away from the tracks at Peraliya (in eastern Sri Lanka) by the pressing waves. The local people look upon it less as a relic than as a shrine ?where, it seems, this country?s grief comes together?.

 Disaster throws into relief the raw, inchoate instincts of man. These are vividly captured in the chilling video-footage of two men scuffling over the gold chain of an injured woman and the rape of a woman washed up by the waves, her hands tied back. 

 Bindra?s account resonates with the emotional upheaval that takes place in human perceptions in the face of such sorrow and disaster, and the resultant doubts that are raised about life itself. Like the journalist?s professional ?neutrality?, the readers? ability to stay unmoved too comes under a severe test here.

 STALLING TACTICS

 Sectarian politics often masquerades as economic logic. A good example of this is the left?s opposition to the privatization of airports. The left?s case is seemingly based on two arguments ? that the airport employees are opposed to it and that the move violates the common minimum programme of the United Progressive Alliance government. The employees? opposition is only a manifestation of the left?s political strategy. But the restructuring of airports is a larger economic issue; it makes little economic sense to reduce it to a question of the security of jobs. And the reference to the CMP suggests that the left wants to use it, not as a guiding principle of economic strategy, but as a tool with which to stall reforms. The left?s argument ? that airports need to be modernized but not privatized ? gives away its political game. The inadequate infrastructure at Indian airports underscores the need for their modernization. It makes eminent sense for the government to raise the necessary funds through privatization.

 The controversy raises serious questions about the left?s position on economic reforms. For all the enthusiasm that Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee shows to woo private capital to Bengal, the left parties continue to be prisoners of their old politics. Hence their blind faith in the supposed virtues of the public sector and their half-hearted approval of the private sector. The fundamental debate about economic reforms makes it irrelevant whether a public sector unit makes profits or losses. It is about the role of the government in the economy. It is, therefore, immaterial that the Airports Authority of India makes profits. The really important issue is whether the government should leave it to the private sector to build and manage airports and spend more of its funds and energy on social sectors like education and healthcare. The left?s position is thus much more than a stumbling block to the government?s efforts to overhaul the airports. It is an ominous signal that the left stalls economic reforms as a price for its support to the UPA government.

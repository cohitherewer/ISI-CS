 Letters to Editor

 Hard to please

 Sir ? The leftists are behaving irresponsibly as far as their policy framework and political interventions are concerned. The leftist argument against the disinvestment of another nominal 10 per cent shares of Bhel is that this will lead to GE, Alstom, Siemens, ABB and other such companies to take control of the prestigious company. But this is nothing short of being unreasonable, besides being blind to the need for resource mobilization for other services. The leftists ignore the simple logic that to maintain product quality and make profit, Bhel needs professional management. The proposed sale of shares is unlikely to come in its way. 

 The left had a point in opposing the recent price rise of petroleum products, but it relinquished the advantage by calling strikes and jeopardizing public life. Its opposition to the new pension schemes is yet another proof of how the left is out of touch with reality. Our comrades know full well that the existing schemes, with high superannuating benefits, will not be sustainable ? given the increasing life-spans ? unless employees contribute to the fund while they are earning. And yet, they refuse to acknowledge the truth. Another irrational agitation is against the reduction of interest rates on Employees? Provident Fund. The leftists insist on 9.5 per cent interest rate for organized workers, with an additional plea that the shortfall should be made good by taxing the general public, and not from the reserve fund as has been decided. The left continues to be apprehensive of foreign direct investment inflows and fails to appreciate that South Korea, China and other countries in south-east Asia have turned around their economies with the help of FDIs. 

 The left generally dislikes competition in any sector. Which is why it insists on the amendment to the Electricity Act 2003. Add to this the left policy of wooing the minorities, its failure to check the entry of illegal immigrants in West Bengal, and you have a political group whose forte is anything but responsibility.

 Yours faithfully,

A.K. Das, Calcutta

 Sir ? If the intention of the four left parties, led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist), was to shake the United Progressive Alliance out of its complacency, then the comrades have been largely successful. Their decision to stay away from the coordination committee meetings of the UPA has sent the Congress into a tizzy; the party has been quick to respond with assurances that the concerns of the left would not only be addressed but also resolved. After being shaken, the Congress has stirred itself to ensure that the apparent disagreement over the disinvestment of Bhel does not develop into discord and spill over to other areas. It is, however, hard to accept that the government?s move to divest 10 per cent of its stake in Bhel could by itself have driven the left to an extreme decision.

 The left has agreed to a number of policy decisions at variance with their ideological stance, particularly in regard to the telecom and civil aviation sectors and FDI. These compromises were in return for the government?s relenting in other areas, such as the payout of 9.5 per cent interest on provident fund accumulations. More recently, despite their avowed opposition to a hike in the prices of petroleum products, the left went along with the government on the understanding that kerosene and cooking gas would be spared. The fact that these tricky patches could be negotiated suggests that the left?s latest complaint is not about Bhel alone.

 All this does not augur well, and the Congress should address the deeper causes of the left?s dissatisfaction. It does not look as though the left will go so far as to withdraw support, but the UPA needs to have the left marching alongside to prevent the UPA boat from rocking. 

 Yours faithfully,

Paroma Roy, Calcutta

 None like them

 Sir ? With the demise of Eknath Solkar, the era of excellent slip fielding in Indian cricket has come to an end. His test career of 53 catches in just 27 matches speaks of his skill. What these statistics do not say is that this feat of close-in fielding was achieved without the help of protective gear like helmets and guards. It is unfortunate that this great cricketer passed away when he was planning to start an academy to groom good fielders for India.

 Yours faithfully,

R. Sekar, Angul, Orissa

 Sir ? It is sad that the Board of Control for Cricket in India did not think of utilizing the services of Eknath Solkar to improve the poor fielding standard of Indians. And now it is too late.

 Yours faithfully,

N.K. Agarwal, Calcutta

 Sir ? Indian cricket has lost two greats in quick succession. It was Mushtaq Ali who passed away first, and Eknath Solkar followed within a few weeks. Mushtaq was an unorthodox batsman who defied the rules of copybook cricket ? sweeping deliveries from outside the off stump and walking down the pitch to fast bowlers. How can anyone forget the Calcutta crowd threatening to boycott a test match in protest against the selectors? decision to drop Mushtaq?

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke.C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? The commitment to the game and unassuming lifestyles of Mushtaq Ali and Eknath Solkar should serve as examples to our present lot of pampered cricketers.

 Yours faithfully,

Debashis Saha, Calcutta

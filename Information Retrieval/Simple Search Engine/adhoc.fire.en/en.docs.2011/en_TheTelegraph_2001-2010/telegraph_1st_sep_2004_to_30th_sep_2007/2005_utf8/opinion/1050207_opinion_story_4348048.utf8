 EMPEROR STRIKES BACK

 Gwynne dyer

 Most countries got rid of their kings in the end, and the rest took away most of their powers, because inbred young men whose main talents (if any) lie in manly outdoor pursuits like jousting, polo or falconry tend to be particularly bad at running countries. King Gyanendra of Nepal isn?t young any more, but otherwise, he fits the profile perfectly.

 Gyanendra never expected to be king at all. He inherited the job in 2001 when almost the entire royal family, including his brother, King Birendra, was massacred by crown prince Dipendra, who was high on drink, drugs and the allure of automatic weapons at the time. Gyanendra has been trying to take back his late brother?s surrender of absolute power in 1990 ever since, and on February 1 he made his move.

 He had already fired four prime ministers in three years, but now he has shut the whole democratic system down. He put all senior politicians under house arrest and jailed hundreds of other prominent people, he suspended freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and a free press, and he took direct personal control of Nepal on the pretext that only he could save it from the Maoists.

 Wrong move

 Bad luck for the 27 million Nepalese, but this ?royal coup? has implications that reach well beyond Nepal?s borders, for the Maoists are real. They are a ruthless guerrilla army that already controls 15 or 20 of Nepal?s 75 districts and has a powerful presence in most of the others. They have little trouble in selling their ideas to wretchedly poor Nepalese peasants trying to scratch a living from the overcrowded lower slopes of the Himalayas.

 They were winning already, but now they are going to start winning a lot faster. Gyanendra?s government has lost its legitimacy, he is not personally popular, and he has never displayed any notable political or military talent. His coup is a godsend for the Maoists, and they will exploit it vigorously. This has serious implications for India and China.

 The Maoists know that they will not really be marching into Kathmandu in triumph any time soon, because India will intervene militarily, if necessary, to stop them. It would do so because it has its own Maoist problem: Maoist rebels have established strong ideological bases right across the ?tribal belt? of India, where poverty-stricken and despised ethnic minorities are oppressed both by feudal landlords and upper-caste Hindus.

 Freedom song

 Since the Maoists of Nepal know that India is vulnerable on this front and fear an Indian intervention, they will help India?s Maoists grow into a bigger threat. lf India does end up intervening in Nepal, it will have a huge negative impact on China, which is highly sensitive about its disputed Tibetan border with India.

 The two countries fought a war over that disputed border in 1962, and although Chinese forces withdrew voluntarily, the fear that China might again become an enemy was India?s main incentive for developing nuclear weapons. But the central half of the India-China border is occupied by Nepal which acts as a buffer zone. Beijing would find it hard to stay calm if Indian forces moved into that buffer zone in strength.

 What is at stake is how the relationship between the two Asian neighbours evolves. Their relationship for the past generation has been reasonably civil, and there?s no good reason that it shouldn?t remain so. But there?s no guarantee that it will, either, and an Indian military intervention in Nepal could send it spinning down a very different path.That is why India should act now to force the king to step back and restore the democratic constitutional order. No matter how incompetent democratic politicians are it is only they who have the legitimacy to resist the Maoists successfully.

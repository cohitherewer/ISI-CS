 Letters to Editor

 Play by the new rule

 Sir ? The Centre is considering ways to get around the Supreme Court ruling on the de-reservation of seats in unaided private colleges (?Arjun keeps law cards close to chest?, Aug 18). With several states going to polls in the next few months, seat reservation is going to become a major issue. Hence the urgency to stick to quotas. Far from serving its purpose, a continuation of the reservation policy will further divide the population. Instead of relinquishing its responsibility to the backward castes just by making reservations, the government should think in terms of providing proper healthcare and primary education to the economically weaker sections of society, irrespective of caste and religion. Reservations help the family-members of those who have already benefited from the policy. A government servant belonging to a reserved community gets promotion on the basis of reservation. His children get automatic admission in colleges, they pay lower examination fees when applying for jobs, travel free by train to the examination centre and enjoy reserved seats in government jobs. 

 The government proposes to pass a law to counter the court ruling. This will only undermine the judiciary. If the government seriously wants to remove inequality, then let every citizen be treated equally. 

 Yours faithfully,

K.S. Anand, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Whenever any Supreme Court ruling is not to the liking of the government, it either amends the Constitution or enacts a legislation to subvert the judgment. This is a dangerous trend. The judiciary is being misused by all and sundry. Politicians use it to throw a spanner in the works of rival parties, and so do the influential in society. The decision of the highest court in the land is always in the public interest, though it may go against political parties? interests. But if such decisions are not implemented by the government, then they lose their meaning. It is the duty of the government to provide free or low cost education to the backward castes and classes. But those educational institutions which do not seek financial aid from the government should be free from government control in their procedural norms. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Mahesh Kumar, New Delhi

 Sir ? The Supreme Court has done yeoman service to students by freeing unaided colleges from the clutches of the government. But if there is a central entrance test for admission into colleges, the minimum qualifying marks and fees need to be fixed. In the absence of this, there is likely to be further chaos. The United Progressive Alliance government seems ready to cave in to pressure from its allies to overturn the court judgment. Arjun Singh has already agreed in principle to this. But all such attempts need to be resisted ? by NGOs, colleges and the public.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Undoubtedly, the recent apex court ruling has the potential to increase competition among educational institutions and, in the long run, enhance the quality of education in medical and engineering colleges. The removal of state-imposed quotas should facilitate the free flow of students. Those institutions conscious of quality and excellence would be able to invest in infrastructure and improve their faculty. But then, will the ruling really come into practice given that several state governments and the ?reserved? categories are already planning to oppose the move?

 Yours faithfully,

J.S. Acharya, Hyderabad 

 Sir ? The Indian Constitution has made no distinction between government-run, government-aided and unaided institutions in the matter of reservations. Unfortunately, the apex court ignored this feature and granted greater autonomy to unaided minority and non-minority professional colleges. The latter can now structure their admission procedure and fees without government interference. They will be free to further their financial interests, sell the seats instead of admitting candidates on merit. Without government control, one cannot hope that admissions will be non-exploitative.

Yours faithfully, 

Kishore Kumar Soma, Hyderabad 

Sir ? On various occasions the courts have tried to fix the percentage of seats state governments can reserve in colleges, both private and government-aided. And these figures have varied, from 40 per cent to 59 per cent in some cases. If such a high percentage of seats had to be reserved for different categories in government and government-aided colleges, how can the private colleges be suddenly liberated from that responsibility? It should be remembered that ours is a disparate society and that the weaker and deprived sections need to be given access to certain social benefits at reasonable rates so that they have a chance to improve their lot.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Kamat, Alto Porvorim, Goa

 Sir ? Do the really needy, backward students get to taste the benefits of the reservation policy? If the government quota in colleges and institutions is specially designed for the poor and backward sections of society then the policy should relate to the economic status of a family instead of caste. The Supreme Court verdict should be viewed as the first step towards dismantling the quota system. And the court expects compliance from both politicians and the public.

Yours faithfully, 

Shubhajit Chakraborty, Calcutta

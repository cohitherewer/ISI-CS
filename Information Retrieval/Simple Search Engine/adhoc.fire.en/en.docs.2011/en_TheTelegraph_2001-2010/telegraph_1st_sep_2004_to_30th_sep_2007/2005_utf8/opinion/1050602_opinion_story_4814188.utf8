 NEW LEAF 

 Humphrey Bogart with a statutory warning? That would open up new horizons of entertainment, no doubt, but these were not on Mr Anbumani Ramadoss?s mind. The Union minister for health was impelled by the solemn ambience of World Tobacco Day to announce a ban on smoking on screen, whether in films or in television serials. Since nothing can be done about the classics, scenes filmed in the past with smoking in them would carry a warning about the harmful effects of tobacco. The censors will now have something new to snip in order to protect the mindless viewer from himself. It has long been accepted that the ordinary Indian, that is, the citizen who is neither sitting in the ministry nor has been given the privileged position of monitor-in-the-class by the ministers, is quite unable to decide for himself how much sex is good for him or how much violence he can watch without puking. The health ministry now feels that he cannot even tell when he is killing himself. So not only should he be kept out of the way of temptation, but he should also be firmly reminded of the ill-effects of smoking every time he wants to let his hair down and watch an old film.

 There might be a small point about artistic freedom ? or all basic freedoms ? when the government begins to dictate to directors what they can or cannot show. But that is, evidently, unimportant, when the government decides to make the personal habits of citizens its own headache. Not that smoking is to be encouraged. The ill-effects of smoking on smokers and non-smokers are being discussed and advertised; public education campaigns and media reports form their own strong argument against it. The tobacco merchant is on the backfoot ? comparatively ? all over the world. But every minister likes to make his mark, however absurd. The information and broadcasting ministry is not pleased at all: if such a rule is to be made, that is the ministry to make it. In the rare overlap of health and entertainment, old scenes may appear completely new. In a state where young people are forbidden to take umbrellas into parks for fear of what they might get up to behind them, for example, obscuring pixels and warning scrolls would provide a visual feast in the famous scene in Pratidwandi, where the young man lights the sparsely-clad dancer?s cigarette. Art is injurious to health.

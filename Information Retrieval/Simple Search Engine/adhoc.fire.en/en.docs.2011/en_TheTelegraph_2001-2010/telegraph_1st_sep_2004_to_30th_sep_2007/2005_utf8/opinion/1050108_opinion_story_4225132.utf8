 STATE OF THE ART

 Is it just a myth that the courts in India are overloaded with cases? Else the highest court in the land could not have been expected to look into totally nonsensical petitions. If there is an astral point where nonsense ascends to pure drivel, then Mr Sanjiv Bhatnagar?s petition about changing a word in India?s national anthem has achieved that heaven. The mention of Sind in ?Jana-Gana-Mana? is no longer true to India?s geo-political reality, runs the petitioner?s argument. Hence this word in Rabindranath Tagore?s song should be replaced with Kashmir ? to remain true to the map. The court, however, had merely allowed the petitioner to draw the attention of the Union government to his sentiments, without being unduly distracted.

 According to the petitioner, Sind being now in Pakistan, its presence in the Indian national anthem hurts the sovereignty of Pakistan while also ?hurting the sentiments? of 100 crore people. Mr Bhatnagar?s sensitivity to the ?sentiments? of people in both Pakistan and India is truly laudable. His ability to adhere to the literal truth is laudable as well, and tendentious into the bargain. If retaining Sind is questionable, how is substituting Kashmir for it, at this point of time, less so? His innocence about the political status of present boundaries is touching in the extreme, matched only by his na?ve confusion over history. That Tagore wrote the song in 1911, long before Partition, is not the issue. The stalwarts in the constituent assembly knew the words of the song as well as Mr Bhatnagar does when they adopted it as the national anthem after the territory of Sind was already in Pakistan.

 Of course, Mr Bhatnagar?s zealous patriotism and territorial strictness place him above ? or beyond ? considerations of metrical balance and harmony of sound and integrity of composition and such other small necessities of poetry. It is embarrassing that a petition such as Mr Bhatnagar?s should become the subject of public debate and judicial scrutiny. Poets, historians, lawyers, fanatics, politicians and India-Pakistan friendship specialists are all making comments or being asked to do so. Statements range from the impossibility of making poetry subject to legal or constitutional strictures, to Tagore?s list being an impressionistic vision of diversity, to Sind being a reference to a civilization rather than a territory ? as is suggested also by the rest of the selective list. More alarm can be discerned in the responses that excising Sind would hurt the Sindhis ? the sentimental argument again ? and that ?Banga? in the poem is hardly the Bengal Tagore knew in 1911. And so on. But the real question raised by Mr Bhatnagar?s petition concerns the fragility of Indian self-confidence. If something is quite so silly, why talk about it? Is it because the petition pretends to touch upon the subject of nationalism?

 WELL DONE

 Indian cricket fans usually have very little to celebrate. Sachin Tendulkar?s record of the highest number of centuries in test cricket will therefore please all cricket lovers around the country despite the fact that it was widely expected. Tendulkar is far too good and far too consistent a batsman to have missed this record which was previously held by Sunil Gavaskar. Nonetheless, he did give his admirers a few moments of doubt when he took an extended layoff from cricket to nurse a tennis elbow. That injury now seems to be behind him and the delightful stroke play that was associated with his name is again evident. He is one of the few batsmen in cricket today about whom the adjective great can be used without any hesitation, the other batsman being Brian Lara. The adjective great has more to do with the manner in which runs are made than with the number of runs scored. Tendulkar has shown the rare ability of scoring against all kinds of attacks on all kinds of wickets. He can also tear apart a bowling attack. When he is in full flow and in top form, he never looks like getting out. Moreover, he has the full array of shots ? from the short-arm pull to the straight drive executed to perfection. What is very important is that his stroke-making is based on the solid foundation of a strong defence. Behind the flair of great batsmanship is the hard work of a grammarian.

 Yet all the adulations which Tendulkar has justly earned for himself should not take away from perspective. It is difficult to recall immediately an innings of Tendulkar which enabled India, by his batting alone, to win a test match. Batsmen of far lesser talent have done so. This is a challenge that Tendulkar must now face and overcome. It is possible to form a hierarchy among the great batsmen of cricket. Is Tendulkar as great a batsman as, say, Vivian Richards or Garfield Sobers? Most serious students of the game will answer in the negative. There was something in the sheer scale of the strokes that a Richards or a Sobers could unleash which was often breathtaking ? the last-minute improvisation, the perfect placement of the shot, and the frequency with which they despatched perfect deliveries to the boundary. Tendulkar has all these qualities but they are not as frequently on display as they were when Richards or Sobers were at the crease. There is, of course, another name which is beyond comparison. The achievement of scoring a century on every third visit to the wicket is something that batsmen can only dream about and never achieve. But Tendulkar can be content that Donald Bradman remarked that Tendulkar?s batting reminded the greatest of all batsmen of himself.

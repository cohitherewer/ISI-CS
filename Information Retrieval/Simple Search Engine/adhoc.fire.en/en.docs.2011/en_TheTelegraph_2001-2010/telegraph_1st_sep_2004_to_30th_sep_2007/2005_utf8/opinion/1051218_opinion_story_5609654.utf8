 Letters to Editor

 Rebels without a cause

 Sir ? Those who feel that they are justified in blocking trains and transport to protest against the injustice done to Sourav Ganguly are certainly in the wrong. Had such a thing happened to a cricketer from another state, would righteous Bengalis have taken to the streets? In the past, many Indian cricketers have been mistreated like Ganguly but Bengalis had never uttered a word then. Dissention is certainly acceptable but disruption of daily life in the name of protest is not.

 Yours faithfully,

 Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Myths and the man

 Sir ? In ?Word and existence? (Dec 14), Pratap Bhanu Mehta decontextualizes ?modernity? as a cultural and historical phenomenon by invoking Roberto Calasso?s notion of literature. In doing so, Mehta stresses the philosophical distinction between fiction and reality and talks of the imagined ground being represented by stories. He also uses Wittgenstein?s notion of language as a repository of life. In The Ruin of Kasch, Calasso says that ?sacrificing something that stands for something else sets in motion the very machinery of language?. But Mehta misconceives language and the world to be two poles in Calasso?s representation of modernity. Mehta points out that for Calasso there are two modes of sacrifice; first, substitution as correspondence, and second, conventional murder. Both these modes of sacrifice represent a substitution of ?the other?. But where Mehta decontextualizes Calasso is in his emphasis on the latter?s understanding of India?s past and its treasure trove of ancient literature. Calasso?s interpretation of the Vedic ritual of sacrifice does not address the heterodoxy of India?s traditions. Moreover, Mehta seems to be unaware that the Buddhist notion of intermediary experiences, which are neither related to existence nor to any linguistically constructed notion of the meaning of life, but refers to a different lived and experiential character, do not at all fit into Calasso?s notion of antiquity. Mehta oversimplifies the diversity of Indian traditions to fit it into his interpretation of Calasso as well as Calasso?s interpretation of our country?s traditions.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The Italian author, Roberto Calasso, has mentioned, and quite correctly too, that an individual ?who reads and silently remembers the words he has read? is the one who realizes the true meaning of existence. According to Calasso, symbols used by rishis indicate the mysterious phenomena of nature, manifested in the inner self. Often, the devoted followers of various religions misinterpret the ritualistic symbols that have been woven into their religious texts, leading to clashes between the various sects. It is time that the followers of all religions learn to harmonize their inner self by interpreting the rituals in the correct manner. This would give birth to a dynamic process, and open their eyes to the wonders of the world. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad 

 Sir ? I would like to thank The Telegraph for organizing the talk by the noted Italian author, Roberto Calasso. Calasso?s profound knowledge of Indian myths and the Vedas made me realize how infinitesimally narrow the spectrum of our understanding is as far as ancient Indian texts are concerned.

 Yours faithfully,

Chandan Das, Calcutta

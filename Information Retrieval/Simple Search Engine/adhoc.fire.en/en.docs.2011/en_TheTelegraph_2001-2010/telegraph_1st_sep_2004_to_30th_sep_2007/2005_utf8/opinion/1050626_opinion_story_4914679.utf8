 DIARY

 Poor Rahul Gandhi. There he is, only a first-time MP, yet to be given any position of responsibility in the party or government, and already Congressmen in his constituency have started making nasty noises. Probably, it was the Congress?s terrible performance in the recent by-polls in Uttar Pradesh that gave Sanjay Singh, Amita Singh and three MLAs from the party the impudence to say that Rahul doesn?t bother to meet them when he comes to Amethi. They were naturally careful not to point a finger directly at the ?heir apparent?. Their grouse was directed at one Mattoo, a wing commander, and Kishorilal, who, supposedly, have been misleading the young leader and blocking the ?genuine? Congress worker?s access to him. Thankfully, for the better part of this month, Rahul was in the US and earlier in Europe, far away from the heat and dust of cow-belt politics. It must have been a much-needed break for the Gandhi scion from the heavy burden of endless expectations and the fever-pitch media hype, what with some people wanting him to be made a Congress gen-sec, given charge of UP, or at the very least given a berth in the ministry. But surely such positive attention is better than the discordant noises emanating from Amethi? 

 Destiny sure has a perverse sense of humour. It?s become impossible, lately, to see LK Advani without thinking of Jinnah. Thus Bhairon Singh Shekhawat cannot be accused of a special viciousness when, on seeing Advani at the function to release Jagmohan?s book, Soul and Structure of Governance in India, he put in a reference to Pakistan?s Qaid-e-azam in his speech. You should ensure that there is some dhamaka like the one over Jinnah to guarantee sales of your book, he advised Jagmohan. After Advaniji?s Jinnah dhamaka, all books on the founder of Pakistan have disappeared from my library, he added. If Advani was irked he didn?t show it. Which was to his credit, whatever the RSS may think.

 Advani?s dhamaka, however, has quite upset the balance of power in the BJP. Some, whose fortunes were on the up, Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj, Yashwant Sinha, are no longer deemed so hot while Pramod Mahajan, who till the other day was on the way out, is back in fashion. The only man who remains unaffected, perhaps because he has nothing to fear or lose, is Murli Manohar Joshi. It?s now for the RSS to judge how the cards stack up.

 Success does wonderful things to one?s confidence. Thus it is a hugely relaxed and poised face that Sonia Gandhi presents to the world these days. Oh, there are the faux pas of old. Just the other day, she referred to IT secretary Brajesh Kumar as Brajesh Mishra. These days, however, the Congress president has learned to laugh it off ? I?m not wearing my spectacles, she proffered lightly. 

 But if Sonia?s changed, her colleagues in the party haven?t kept pace. Besides Dayanidhi Maran, who was present as the host, attending the function along with Sonia were three cabinet ministers ? Shivraj Patil, Sis Ram Ola and Vilas Muttemwar ? reportedly under fire for their performance. The rest of the ministry too was invited, only it had something better, more important, to do ? attend the cabinet meeting to discuss the petroleum price hike. Clearly for the three ministers in attendance, job security was more important than the nation?s energy security. 

 If Tamil Brahmins are called Tambrahms, what would you call Mayavati?s Brahmin supporters?

 ?Membrahmins?, of course.

 Anbumani Ramadoss was careful to congratulate Rajnikanth on not smoking in his latest release, Chandramukhi. A little too careful, some would say. In fact, the latter would go so far as to say that more than concern for the health of citizens, the Union health minister?s recent interest in on-screen smoking had something to do with the Tamil superstar. They would allege that the Union health minister was only joining the war whose earlier rounds had been played out when Rajnikanth?s Baba was released last year to huge protests by the PMK and violent reprisals from Rajni fan clubs. Anbumani?s idea, they would say, was to scotch one of the stock-in-trades of Rajni?s screen act ? his distinctive manner of lighting the weed on-screen. Would these idle speculators be true? There?s never smoke, they say, without a fire somewhere. But Rajni can take heart from the fact that Chandramukhi is a big hit even without his smoking.

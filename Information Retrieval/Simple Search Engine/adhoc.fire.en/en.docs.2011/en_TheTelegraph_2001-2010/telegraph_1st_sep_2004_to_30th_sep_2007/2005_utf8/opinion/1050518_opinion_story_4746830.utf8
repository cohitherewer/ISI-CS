 When defence is offence

 Sir ? K. Natwar Singh, who became the external affairs minister courtesy the Nehru-Gandhi family, obviously considers attending the death anniversary of Rajiv Gandhi more important than his scheduled visit to Senegal for a meeting with the foreign ministers of several west African countries (?Natwar drops trip, angers Africa?, May 15). The date and the venue of the meeting were finalized only last month in consultation with and at the behest of Singh himself. But perhaps Singh does not maintain a diary. Or worse, he is more bothered by what would displease his party president than what would offend a few friendly nations, whose political and economic good will are crucial to India. But then if the ministerial chair itself is lost, how does it matter if India has a seat in the United Nations security council or not?

 Yours faithfully,

 A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Plane truths

 Sir ? The rejection of the Phukan commission report goes to show how shamelessly judicial commissions are used to safeguard political interests (?Junk report, cries Cong?, May 5). The National Democratic Alliance had done its best to give the earlier Venkataswamy commission a quick burial. There is merit in the Congress?s demand for the publication of the Venkataswamy report. The NDA, in fact, has famously used judges to its advantage. The petrol-pump scandal during its reign was evidence of this. However, the United Progressive Alliance is no better. Look at the way Laloo Prasad Yadav has tried to manipulate the judiciary in the fodder scam. The report of the Banerji committee, constituted to probe into Godhra, has also been used to push the UPA agenda. All of which points to the fact that there is little use in wasting public funds on politically-motivated judicial commissions. Appointments of retired judges for enquiries should henceforth be approved by the Supreme Court or the respective high courts of the region.

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba

 Sir ? It is annoying to see the NDA choosing to extend its boycott of the parliament till the budget session got over despite the appeals made by the Lok Sabha speaker. Although the NDA has been clamouring for the removal of the railways minister, it is obvious that the NDA MPs remained absent primarily because they lacked both the courage and the conviction to confront the ruling party over the Indian air force allegedly extending its largesse to Justice S.N. Phukan for his personal tours. The finance minister too has flayed the former NDA minister for divestment, Arun Shourie, for the much-debated sale of the Juhu Centaur hotel. 

 Had the NDA really felt that the railways minister should have no place in the cabinet, it should have debated on the matter by participating in the house. By boycotting parliament, the NDA not only created a bad precedent, but it also did grave injustice to the crores of voters who sent it to parliament to voice their concerns. Last year, too, the NDA had initially boycotted parliamentary proceedings. If political parties adopt boycott techniques to evade debate on issues which they find uncomfortable, then parliamentary democracy would become meaningless. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The ?Phukan plane? issue is being blown out of proportion to divert attention (?Pranab sticks to Phukan plane facts?, May 5). The Congress leaders, quite simply, have not been able to digest the ?adverse? report of S.N. Phukan. An Indian air force aircraft is not such a luxury airliner that it can influence the conscience of a retired Supreme Court judge. Moreover, it is not that Phukan used the aircraft under cover of darkness. Why was no ruckus raised before the submission of the report? It is dangerous to charge a retired judge of the Supreme Court with being unfair in his inquiry. By doing so, the Congress is bringing the entire judiciary under suspicion. 

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

 Sir ? If Arun Shourie is now being investigated for the Centaur deal, so should Praful Patel, the present Union aviation minister. For the recent Air India deal reeks of unfair bias towards Boeing. As for the Phukan commission report, the use of the IAF aircraft by the judge in no way proves that the Phukan report is mala fide or biased. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Sushant Chatterjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is painful to see the work of serving or retired judges being denigrated by politicians. It is time judges seriously pondered over the advisability of heading the various commissions of enquiry constituted by Central and state governments because it is constitutionally incumbent on judges to maintain and protect their dignity.

 Yours faithfully,

 Hem Raj Jain, Bangalore

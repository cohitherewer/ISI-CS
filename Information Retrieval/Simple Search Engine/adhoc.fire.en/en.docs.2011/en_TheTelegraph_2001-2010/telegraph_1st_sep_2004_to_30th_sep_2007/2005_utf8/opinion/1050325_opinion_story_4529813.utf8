 More Sinned Against

 Devil on horseback

 ATTILA: A BARBARIAN KING AND THE 

 FALL OF ROME 

 By John Man, Transworld, $ 8.50

 Attila is the bogeyman of Roman 

 history. In Gibbon, he appears as the epitome of evil. Liberal 

 historians of the 20th century have followed Gibbon and 

 shown Attila as pre-industrial Europe?s Hitler. Strangely, 

 in post-Communist Hungary, Attila is considered the founder 

 of the nation. Many children are named after Attila there. 

 Attila ? ?little father? ? was an appellation and his real name is lost to history. The Huns were illiterate, they have left us no written records. Their language too has vanished. Whatever we know about the Huns has come from their enemy, the Christian monks and Roman diplomats who were targetted by Attila. 

 The Huns, says John Man, were an offshoot of the Xiongnus tribe which established an empire in north China around 200 BC. For some reason, the Xiongnus were called Huns by the Romans. The Chinese, along with other nomadic tribes, destroyed the Xiongnus empire and this set off a chain reaction. The Xiongnus migrated west and moved into Crimea.

 Towards the end of fourth century, the Huns attacked the Goths in south Russia and then in the Balkans. The Goths moved into the eastern Roman Empire, and in the Battle of Adrianopole (378AD), defeated the Romans. 

 The Romans were to get more bad news. Information filtered in from the Goths that a greater danger ? ?devil?s horsemen? who looked like Centaurs ? was coming from the east. In reality, the steppe nomads were so adept at riding that to people from sedentary civilizations it seemed as if they were rivetted to the horses. Relying on archaeological evidence, Man argues that the Huns used a modified form of recurved horn bows. This, along with Attila?s leadership, made the Huns the most formidable of the steppe nomads.

 The Huns had a form of dual kingship. By 420, Attila had deposed his elder brother, Bleda, and anointed himself sole ruler. His empire extended from the Black Sea in the east to the Rhine in the west, from the Baltic in the north to the Danube in the south. We know very less about his personal life. His lifestyle was austere and had many wives. One symbol of the Germanic chiefs accepting Attila?s bondage was to send their daughters to his household.

 Attila attacked both the eastern and western Roman empires. Unlike other historians, Man argues that Attila was not merely a robber baron. He also tried to build an empire. But over-ambition ruined his plans. Instead of tackling his enemies one by one, he attacked both the empires and the floating Germanic tribes. Attila?s forces also suffered from strategic overreach and were finally destroyed by the plague during his Italian expedition. After Attila?s death (of excessive drinking), the Goths revolted against the Huns, who retreated into Russia and then vanished out of recorded history. 

 Nevertheless, Attila hastened the decline of the Roman imperium by forcibly pushing the German-speaking tribes into Italy and completely disrupting the Roman defences. After this, Rome became easy prey to vandals. Some Huns settled in Hungary and the Magyars trace their descent from them.

 This book has both strengths and weaknesses. Scholars will quibble over the lack of footnotes. Moreover, Man does not engage with the recent ecological explanation for the expansion and contraction of the steppe nomadic empires. Still, this book is extremely readable and is the only one to be published in English in recent times about one of the most enigmatic warlords of history.

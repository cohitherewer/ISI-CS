 MAKE THEM PAY FOR IT 

 Gujarat riot victims have claimed 

 damages against the VHP and BJP. Tarunabh Khaitan explores 

 the precedents and implications 

 Ahmedabad, February 

 28, 2002 

 The Rs 8-crore damages claimed 

 against the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the Bharatiya Janata 

 Party by the relatives of the victims of the Gujarat riots 

 raise complex issues about the role constitutional morality 

 can play in the daily lives of citizens. The foundational 

 values of equality, human rights, security of life and liberty, 

 enshrined in the chapter on fundamental rights of the Indian 

 Constitution, have traditionally been invoked by the citizens 

 against the State. The suit filed in the Gujarat court is 

 a wake-up call to the reality of violation of these foundational 

 values by non-State and quasi-State actors. 

 These entities perform quintessentially 

 public functions affecting the rights of citizens and include 

 political parties, corporate bodies, non-governmental organizations, 

 trade unions, employers, educational institutions, building 

 societies and hospitals. The need to make non-State actors 

 accountable to constitutional values is only more acute 

 with the pre-liberalization State functions of producing 

 steel, dispensing medicines and educating engineers moving 

 into private hands. Therefore, fundamental rights should 

 not only inform the vertical citizen-State relationship 

 but also the horizontal citizen-citizen relationship.

 Civil action claiming damages 

 against the State for breaching its duty of care is not 

 new. In at least three cases, various high courts have ordered 

 the State to pay compensation to victims of riots. In R. 

 Gandhi v. Union of India (1989), the Madras high court 

 held that ?members of the Sikh community form an integral 

 part of Indian society whose rights have been flagrantly 

 infringed by the inaction of the law enforcing authorities. 

 These unfortunate victims of arson and violence are entitled 

 to seek reasonable compensation from the State of Tamil 

 Nadu, which has failed in its duty to protect their constitutional 

 and legal rights.? Similar views were expressed by the Jammu 

 and Kashmir high court in M/s Inderpuri General Stores 

 v. Union of India (1992) and very recently by the Delhi 

 high court in Manjit Singh Sawhney v. Union of India 

 (2005). In all these cases, the courts ordered the State 

 to pay compensation to the victims of the anti-Sikh riots 

 for its inaction in protecting life and property.

 By not claiming damages from the 

 State, the Gujarat suit digresses from these cases. It embodies 

 a realization that the responsibility for compensation of 

 victims rests primarily with the perpetrators, and only 

 vicariously with the tax-payers. The suit relies on the 

 precedent set by the Kerala high court, which ordered damages 

 to be paid by the political party whose bandh call 

 resulted in violations of fundamental rights. The high court 

 held that ?No political party or organisation can claim 

 that it is...entitled to prevent the citizens not in sympathy 

 with its viewpoints, from exercising their fundamental rights.? 

 The judgment was endorsed by the Supreme Court in Communist 

 Party of India (M) v. Bharat Kumar (1998). 

 The propriety of the right to 

 call a bandh need not, however, be called into question 

 in the riot compensation cases. The damages are sought for 

 acts which violate the right to life, liberty and security, 

 whether or not they took place during a bandh. That said, 

 however, the fact of a bandh call surely is strong evidence 

 for causally linking the alleged acts of violations of rights 

 to the party which gave the call.

 The responsibility of quasi-State 

 or private bodies should not be limited to preservation 

 of the right to life, liberty and security alone. Such liability 

 should be extended to the right against discrimination as 

 well. Article 15 of the Constitution forbids the State from 

 discriminating against any person on the basis of his or 

 her race, caste, creed, sex, and so on. However, except 

 for the Civil Rights Act, 1955, which prohibits discrimination 

 on the basis of caste, Indian law has largely disallowed 

 the horizontal citizen-to-citizen application of the right 

 against discrimination. 

 The point was reinforced by the 

 Supreme Court in its recent decision in Zoroastrian Co-operative 

 Housing Society Limited v. District Registrar Co-operative 

 Societies (2005), where it allowed a housing society 

 to rent and sell accommodation only to members of a particular 

 religious community. Reports of discrimination by medical 

 establishments, private employers and educational institutions 

 on the basis of religion, caste and HIV status are not rare. 

 Such division of civil society into ghettoes facilitates 

 the insularity of different groups and nurses prejudice 

 among them, with the disastrous consequences we have witnessed 

 too often.

 Many liberal democracies which 

 respect human rights have made discrimination by non-State 

 actors a civil liability. The US Civil Rights Act, 1964 

 has helped to shape a political discourse of inclusion over 

 the years. The South African constitution prohibits discrimination 

 on the grounds of ?age, gender, sex, pregnancy, marital 

 status, ethnic or social origin, colour, sexual orientation, 

 age, disability, religion, conscience, belief, culture, 

 language and birth? by the State as well as by any person.

 In Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan 

 (1997) the Supreme Court opened up to the horizontal 

 application of fundamental rights and held private employers 

 liable for sexual harassment of employees in the work place. 

 This idea needs to be taken to its logical conclusion. However, 

 a judicial development of any doctrine is patchy, and is 

 dictated more by the needs of the case at hand than by the 

 overall policy choices. While the judicial expansion of 

 the rights of citizens by applying them horizontally is 

 welcome, it is time parliament laid down a coherent policy 

 embodied in a statute. 

 Parliament should, by law, extend 

 the fundamental rights available in part III of the Constitution 

 against the State to other natural and juristic persons 

 who are capable of violating these rights as well. Such 

 a law would need to resolve complex issues such as establishing 

 efficient enforcement machinery and outlining the appropriate 

 remedies available for such violations that should preferably 

 be settled through a public debate rather than through judicial 

 law-making.

 A civil liability on non-State 

 and quasi-State actors to respect the fundamental values 

 of the Constitution may not see the end of communal violence 

 in this country. But it will make it more expensive to loot, 

 kill and discriminate. Many acts of communal violence have 

 gone unpunished by the criminal justice system. A civil 

 remedy has the advantage of having to satisfy a lesser standard 

 of proof than the more demanding ?beyond reasonable doubt? 

 standard required in a criminal trial. It is also more sensitive 

 to the restorative and remedial needs of the victim. Further, 

 a civil remedy is driven by the victim rather than by the 

 State officials (especially the police) who themselves might 

 be implicated in the violations. 

 This is certainly not to suggest 

 that the criminal justice system can be left in the mess 

 it is in. A civil remedy, like the one demanded in the Gujarat 

 cases, will complement the quest for justice. Those who 

 reject the values of tolerance and plurality underpinning 

 our multicultural Constitution should pay up.

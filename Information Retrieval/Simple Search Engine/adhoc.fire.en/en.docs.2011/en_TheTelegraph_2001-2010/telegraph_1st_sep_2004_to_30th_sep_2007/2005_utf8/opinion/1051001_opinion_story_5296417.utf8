 Letters to Editor

 Who?s the better boss?

 Sir ? Why make the Bharatiya Janata Party the butt of ridicule because it dances to the tune of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh? It is unfair to mock the BJP on this issue now, when the Congress is openly and shamelessly acting on the orders of the left. At least the RSS heads the sangh parivar of which the BJP is the eldest offspring. The left has been far from friendly to the Congress, except when it wanted a share of the power pie. Surely it is far more dignified to take orders from one?s parent than from a partner in a marriage of convenience?

 Yours faithfully,

 Arta Mishra, Cuttack

 Your terror and mine

 Sir ? Achin Vanaik does well to explode the myth that there is some correlation between terrorism and Islam (?Killing to win?, Sept 21). It is true that in the last couple of years, a majority of the terrorist attacks have been orchestrated by Islamic outfits, but terrorism worldwide is the outcome of the unfair policies of powerful nations like the United States of America. It is common knowledge that Osama bin Laden was the US?s prot?g? who was provided with funds to fight the Russians in Afghanistan. What happened in Basra last week should be an eyeopener to the world (?Basra blow to Britain?, Sept 22). The British forces keeping ?peace? in Basra went on a rampage to free undercover British soldiers detained by Iraqi securitymen. It is ironic that the keepers of law are the perpetrators of such barbarism. Who is the terrorist here and who the terrorized?

 Yours faithfully,

Tabishul Haque, Kurseong

 Sir ? In his eagerness to be politically correct, Achin Vanaik has enlisted India as a proponent of ?state-terrorism? along with countries such as Pakistan and China. What does he think is the government?s modus operandi in terrorizing its citizens? From jihadis in Kashmir to Naxalites in Andhra to the Ulfa in Assam, the government is facing armed insurgency by groups which terrorize the poor into submission, claiming to be their guardians at the same time. If the state tries to take development to them, they resist, for fear that their support base will dwindle. There is enough sympathy for the underdog and space for deliberation in the Indian democracy to defeat the forces of terrorism. India is not like China, where a brutal authoritarian state can displace its own citizens without having to pay compensation.

 Vanaik?s argument that Irish terrorism should be branded ?Catholic terrorism?, does not hold water because the allegiance of Irish Catholics lies with Dublin rather than with the Vatican. 

 Finally, it is true that the state often adopts coercive tactics against some of its citizens, but a far greater evil is to plunge the entire civic society into strife and turmoil, to build an utopian kingdom in which freedoms and rights are at a premium.

 Yours faithfully,

Aruni Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir ? On September 12, the day K.P. Nayar reported that Canada had reconciled itself with India?s status as a nuclear power, Canada announced an agreement with the Indian foreign minister, K. Natwar Singh, to supply nuclear equipment to India. The Telegraph was the only paper to predict this change in Canadian policy. We need such newspapers to highlight the duplicity of countries like Canada on the nuclear issue.

 Yours faithfully,

Anahita Ratabzade, Ottawa

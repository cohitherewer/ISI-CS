 HORSES ARE LEFT OUT 

 Malvika Singh

 The splendid Beating the Retreat happened last Saturday at the spectacular Vijay Chowk in New Delhi. Sadly, Doordarshan had their worst cameraman filming this event. As the handsome cavalry walked past the saluting base, the camera moved to the top of the lit dome rather than capturing the march past of the horses?silly. This proves how DD has been left far behind. Those who run this ?station? are babus who do not have to compete financially or in terms of quality. They are marking time, and are suffocating all potential.

 This same breed of men and women are creating havoc in most ministries. Unless the minister is fully vigilant, secretaries operate on their own whims. Recent examples show how new, ?dynamic? ministers, who are aggressively combating the traditional corrupt practices in their domain, are being sabotaged by the babu with a vested interest. Some ministers manage to fight back and expose the bad practices. 

 Rushed through

 Others succumb to the babu because it is just easier. Therefore, even in the present UPA dispensation there are decisions being taken without ministers knowing, and in many instances proposals are not put to the minister at all. Such operations are against a legitimate code of conduct and the prime minister needs a ?trusted? representative, an ombudsman, who is his eyes and ears. With corruption levels as high as they are, and with the UPA having promised to restore transparent governance, there seems to be no other solution to this curious problem.

 In the environment ministry, agenda that were put into play by the last government are being pushed through cabinet with great haste. One such, that has to do with protected forest land and tribals, that contravenes national and international laws, is being ?rushed? through the process to be tabled in the budget session of Parliament. Babus placed in this ministry by the last regime to push through their agenda, and who continue in this regime, are moving fast to embarrass the Manmohan Singh government on some of these issues. Populist stances, of releasing forest lands that are protected by national laws, without any sane, scientific and sensitive dialogue with experts outside the stranglehold of babudom and lobbyists, are imperative.

 Danger ahead

 Manmohan Singh does not appear to comprehend the danger of suggesting the repeal of established laws that protect the little that remains of our forests and natural habitat. He seems to be going by what the DMK minister and environment secretary, who held the same positions in the NDA regime, are putting forth. This UPA coalition had vowed to undo the damage of the last NDA government. Why then is it endorsing the horrors that the minister and secretary are putting forth? Why is it following the ?lobbyists? mindlessly? The draft of this Central legislation was done months ago during the NDA days. There are many committed Indians who watch the government?s actions like hawks. When things happen arbitrarily or wrongly, they file legitimate PIL?s and they get the Supreme Court to intervene and stall such contraventions. The judiciary is being compelled to play the role of the executive.

 If this government is looking to redress the injustice done to tribal communities by giving back their rights on forest lands that have been covered by the laws of this land, the maharajahs too should ask the PM to draft a bill to reclaim their states, their lands and their property. Let?s have a free for all. Repeal all acts and laws! Remember Doctor Sahib, if you destroy the protected environment, the next generation will have to contend with deathly drought and disease, and this great land might turn into a desert.

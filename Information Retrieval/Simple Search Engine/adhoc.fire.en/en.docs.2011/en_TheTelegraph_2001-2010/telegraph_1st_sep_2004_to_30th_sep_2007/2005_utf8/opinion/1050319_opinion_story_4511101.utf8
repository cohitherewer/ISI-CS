 THAT?S

 ENOUGH FOR

 NOW

 Some say it?s the Sena?s Bihari-baiting. Others, that there?s an Ambani hand 

at play. One thing is certain ? 

Sanjay Nirupam is resigned to neither

 Each time the family wishes to take a break from looking at the stern face of the master of the house, they drive down to the nearest traffic intersection in Mumbai to watch Sanjay Nirupam beaming down at them from gigantic Shiv Sena hoardings. Senior Sena leaders, of course, are not as enamoured of the mega-sized images of the ?Purabiya? who made it good in a party formed to safeguard the interests of the Marathi manus. But while the Nirupam family will now have to devise some other forms of leisure, the Shiv Sainiks have reason to cheer: the hoardings will soon be rid of Nirupam?s smiling visage.

 That there was trouble brewing in the Sena kingdom first became apparent last week when Nirupam dropped some broad hints about quitting the party. A few days later, he had expressed concern about the Sena?s xenophobic views, taken up a prickly Reliance issue in Parliament and, before you could say Pramod Mahajan, resigned his Rajya Sabha seat. 

 ?He makes quick decisions. He is fast. He likes pace,? says his wife, Geeta. ??That?s enough,? is the ominous one-liner that is often thrown at us when he thinks he has been pushed around hard,? she says.

 Speed propelled him on the forefront of Shiv Sena since his induction into the party over a decade ago. As a close confidant of Sena executive president Uddhav Thackeray, he had pretty much touched the pinnacle of success within the party, much to the consternation of senior leaders, who saw him as a brash young non-Maharashtrian upstart.

 Not surprisingly, there are few in the Sena ruing Nirupam?s exit. Though Nirupam left with a bang ? bringing up the issue of Reliance Infocomm shares allegedly being sold to three fake companies and hinting at BJP leader Pramod Mahajan?s involvement in the scam ? Sena observers believe that the rumblings were being felt in the party for long. ?He was becoming too big for the party. We had given him a long rope and he took advantage of that. His over-ambition spelled disaster for him,? says senior Sena leader Pramod Navalkar.

 Navalkar and other senior colleagues believe that Nirupam had crossed the line several times in the past. When the Sena was spearheading an anti-Bihari campaign, Nirupam ? a Bihari himself ? was conducting the Chhatt puja, a ritual followed predominantly in the eastern state.

 But what seemed impulsive and rash was actually a well-orchestrated move. Nirupam assumed an angry face to make his presence felt in the party since he had no political experience or sagacity. ?The anger was necessary to establish himself as a Sena man because the party motif is anger, aggression and violence,? says Vaibhav Purandare, journalist and author of The Sena Story, a book detailing the history of the party.

 Nirupam, who worked for Bal Thackeray?s Hindi eveninger, Dopahar ka Saamna, came into prominence following the 1992-93 riots in Mumbai. Thackeray had been talking about the rights of the Hindus, in a bid to expand the party?s base. Analysts were curious to see if he would really open the doors of the insular Sena to outsiders. Nirupam walked in ? but nobody was sure whether Thackeray?s stand ? or Nirupam ? would last.

 While he was there, media savvy Nirupam was always prominent. He steered the Mee Mumbaikar drive, Uddhav Thackeray?s first ever campaign after taking over the party reins. In the 2002 Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation elections he was instrumental in inducting north Indian candidates into the constituency. He convinced the executive president that the move would benefit the Sena ? but it didn?t go down very well with senior leaders in the party. ?I was trying to improve the policy within the party by getting north Indians within the fold,? he says.

 But with Uddhav?s backing, Nirupam moved ahead. He was catapulted to a new high when he was announced one of the 13 deputy leaders within the party and superseded seniors to the Rajya Sabha. The campaign against Nirupam acquired more teeth. And Nirupam hit out.

 The last straw, he says, was earlier this month when he was told not to bring up the question of Reliance Infocomm shares ? an issue embarrassing to Mukesh Ambani. ?I had no desire to start a debate on the issue, but only to ascertain some information I had,? says Nirupam. ?But I was asked by Pramod Mahajan and the party to steer clear of it. Mahajan?s caution was suspicious. But I had had enough, and decided to resign from the party.?

 Insiders say that Reliance bosses also voiced their concern over his desired move in Parliament. Key executive M.N. Chaini, who is close to Bal Thackeray, spoke with the Sena supremo. Nirupam later said he was hurt when Senior Thackeray asked him if Reliance vice-chairman Anil Ambani, feuding with brother Mukesh, had bribed him to raise the RIC shares issue in Parliament.

 Political corridors are abuzz with rumours. Some believe that Nirupam has had enough of Senas anti-Bihari programmes. Some stress that an Ambani hand is at play. Others, such as Purandare, feel that for Nirupam, the time has come to move out of a party hurtling towards fragmentation.

 But friend Rajesh Sinha, who was with Nirupam in Patna?s Anugrah Narayan College, has his own take on the subject. He remembers the time when Nirupam went to meet dreaded criminal Mohan Bind in the Sasaram district of Bihar. ?We feared for his life,? says Sinha. ?But he was never scared of anyone.?

 Nirupam is not a gung-ho undergrad anymore. But, as he says, ?I am not so angry but am certainly young.? Maybe, the family will find him beaming right at home.

 CALLING THE BLUFF

 Malvika Singh

 The image of Mamata Bannerjee crudely flinging papers at the podium of the speaker of the Lok Sabha showed her up to be totally uncouth. No provocation merits such behaviour. When ?leaders? adopt this kind of unacceptable avatar, how can civilized stances be expected on the streets of India? Parliamentarians throwing tantrums of this nature should be debarred from entering Parliament House. Contrasted to this banshee-like jig is the dignified demeanour of Somnath Chatterjee. There is much our elected representatives need to learn from the present speaker of the house.

 I recall going to parliament fairly regularly as a young woman. It was an awesome experience to enter the portals of that spectacular building, sit in the viewers? gallery and look down upon the treasury and opposition benches listening to debates where leaders would argue critical national issues. Nor did they chuck objects at one another, yell like lunatics or constantly ?walk out?. The scenes enacted these days are embarrassing to say the least. Street protests and dharnas have entered Parliament House but alas, there are no water hoses in there to stop the madness. Respectable tax-payers, men and women of integrity, are being exploited and ridiculed as their money is spent propping up irresponsible men and women as they reduce the dignity of democratic functioning to a very base and unacceptable level. It is ironic that as our rate of growth rises, as more people are educated, behaviour patterns become uncouth. Something has gone wrong.

 On the dole

 When Jairam Ramesh, a Rajya Sabha member, questioned certain perks and allowances given to parliamentarians, he was heckled in the house. He should be celebrated for questioning the public ?sponsorship? of those who do not respect the norms and dignity of the house. These men and women are on the national dole and the time has come to look again at that huge waste of money. They must stop exploiting India and fend for themselves. 

 Government servants and politicians must live on what they earn. Free or subsidized accommodation, electricity, telephone calls et al must be brought to a halt. They too should be put through the horrors of life that they have ?bestowed? on us Indians. Only then will they be accountable.

 Here is an example of a shameful privilege. If you have been a member of parliament once and lost thereafter, you are entitled to a lifetime of free rail travel. This is nothing short of a scandal at the cost of the citizen. Rules and norms are constantly bent to achieve that end. That is why the calibre is what it is for all to see.

 Today, even NGOs seek favour and endorsement from ruling parties. Governments have succeeded in coopting voices that should have been ?free?, with no strings attached. In this new millennium, we are being compelled to regress into that square box of views that are stuck in a time-warp of failed ideologies. Two years away from being sixty years old, independent India needs to break loose and question the restrictive and backward thinking of our leaders and their bureaucrats. 

 We need to step out of the box in all spheres, from redundant economic and foreign policies, from stale attitudes towards entrepreneurship and the essential services sector. Sermonizing ?do-gooders?, who claim to speak for the less privileged, should cease to impose their predictable solutions on this country as they prosper on a different type of dole ? funding from overseas.

 It suits these ?protected species? to keep India at heel, to influence policy that holds back those who want to break loose, who dissent, who are motivated and tired of being held back, because that blossoming forth will call the bluff of the ?protected species? and expose them.

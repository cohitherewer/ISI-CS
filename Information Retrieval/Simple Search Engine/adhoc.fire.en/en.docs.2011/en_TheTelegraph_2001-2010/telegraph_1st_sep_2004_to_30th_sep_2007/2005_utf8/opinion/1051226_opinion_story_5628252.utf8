 SEASON OF RISINGS

 Gwynne Dyer

 Bolivia has had more presidents by far than any other country in South America, mainly because so many of them were overthrown long before their terms ended. They were also all white, even though the majority of Bolivia?s population is ?indigenous?, descended wholly or in part from the Indians whose ancestors lived there as subjects of the Inca empire at the time of the Spanish conquest. So what are the odds that Evo Morales, Bolivia?s first indigenous president, will survive a full-term in office?

 Morales faces not only the usual hazards of life as the president of South America?s poorest country, but also the threat of American intervention to overthrow him. As a socialist whose declared goal is to ?end the colonial state? and a leader of the coca farmers who promises to lift the ban on growing coca leaf, the crop from which cocaine is produced, he is deeply unpopular in Washington.

 In the past, policies that are unpopular in the United States of America have proved to be bad for the president?s health in a number of latin American countries. To those who argue that the Bush administration is too deeply mired in the war in Iraq to contemplate acting against Morales, the pessimists point out that the US found the time to overthrow the president in Chile despite being neck-deep in the Vietnam war. The election of Morales, they fear, will focus Washington?s attention on how countries all over latin America are rejecting US tutelage.

 The main target of Washington?s wrath so far has been Venezuela, whose president, Hugo Chavez, has built an unassailable domestic base by spending a lot of the country?s oil revenues on health and education. He has built a close relationship with Cuba?s Fidel Castro and he is now providing Venezuelan oil at a discount to other Caribbean and Central American countries.

 It is Chavez?s incendiary language that gets the headlines ? last month he called President George W. Bush a ?madman, a killer and a mass murderer? ? but his aim is serious: to free all of Latin America from the grip of American influence. Last July?s launch of Telesur, a television network whose aim is to provide an alternative to US-based news for all Latin Americans, is a case in point. It is based in Caracas and partly financed by Venezuela, but it is also backed by the governments of Argentina, Uruguay, Cuba and Brazil.

 Like Chavez in Venezuela, they combine a commitment to the poor and a rejection of the project for a US-dominated ?Free Trade Area of the Americas? with a pragmatic respect for the rules of the free market: no nationalizations and more or less balanced budgets. With this month?s presidential election victories by Michelle Bachelet in Chile and now by Evo Morales in Bolivia, virtually all of South America except Colombia and Peru is now part of this nascent left-wing bloc.

 But the continent is seeing more than just a comeback in modern dress by the traditional left. The Indians and part-Indians who form a downtrodden majority in most of the Andean countries are staging their own comeback. They talk in terms of winning elections and re-writing constitutions, but they basically share the view of Antauro Humala, leader of the Etnocaceristas in Peru: ?There are four races, black, white, yellow and copper. We are the copper people and I want us to be recognised as a race.?

 It will get very fraught in Bolivia when Morales starts re-writing the constitution to include the excluded, but the ethnic solidarity among Bolivian Indians that has helped him into power will also make it very hard for Washington to overthrow him. So long as he avoids the civil war that some of the more extreme members of the white minority may now try to provoke, he will probably manage to serve a full term in office.

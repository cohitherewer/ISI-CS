 Out and About

 A neat Rs 2.75 lakh would be enough for most people to buy one of those small, buggy-sized vehicles flitting around on our pot-holed roads. But not for that god of car makeovers, Dilip Chhabria. The automobile designer has just bought himself a high-end shiatsu massage chair for the above-mentioned price. And what exactly is it about the chair that draws the attention of Chhabria ? famous for the Aston Martin he has designed for Bond?s next flick? ?I can take a massage break and come away rejuvenated in the middle of work,? Chhabria tells us. But what mode does he run his chair on when he needs a massage? Auto pilot?

 Shubha Mudgal

 If you have a good song, go ahead and belt it out. But don?t, please, club it with the not-so-good numbers just for the sake of cutting an album. That?s Shubha Mudgal?s advice for you. And ?though the Indian market hasn?t seen too many single releases in the past, the field is worth exploring?, the vocalist says. To prove her point, she?s gone to town with Namastasyai, a single featuring an experimental track by ex-Euphoria drummer and composer Chris Powell. With Mudgal and Powell leading the way, it shouldn?t be long before we have cassettes with no B-sides. Thank heavens for that!

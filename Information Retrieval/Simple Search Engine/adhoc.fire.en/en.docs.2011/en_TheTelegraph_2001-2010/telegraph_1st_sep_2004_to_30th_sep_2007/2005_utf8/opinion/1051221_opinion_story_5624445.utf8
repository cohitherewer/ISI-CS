 NEW ROUTES IN THE DRUG TRAIL

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the World Drug Report 2005, published by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime

 Some 200 million people, or 5 per cent of the world?s population age 15-64, have used drugs at least once in the last 12 months. This is 15 million higher than last year?s estimate but remains significantly lower than the number of persons using licit psychoactive substances (tobacco: around 30 per cent; alcohol: around half of the general adult population). The number of cannabis users worldwide is now close to 160 million people or 4 per cent of the population age 15-64. Estimates of the number of amphetamine type stimulant users ? 26 million people using amphetamines and 8 million using ecstasy ? are slightly lower than those of last year?s World Drug Report, reflecting declines of methamphetamine use in South-East Asia and of ecstasy use in North America. The number of opiate users is estimated to have risen slightly to around 16 million people (11 million of which abuse heroin), mainly reflecting increasing levels of opiate abuse in Asia. No significant changes were observed in most other parts of the world. The number of cocaine users ? to 14 million people ? rose slightly. 

 In addition to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimates on the total number of drug users, derived from national survey results and extrapolations from partial information of the drug situation in the various countries, the competent authorities of member states provide UNODC with their perceptions of the development of the drug situation in their country on a five-point scale (large increase, some increase, no great change, some decrease, large decrease). The statistical analysis of these responses suggests that overall drug consumption continues to spread at the global level. 

 ...Cannabis use has seen the largest increase over the last few years, notably cannabis herb. This is followed by ATS, cocaine and opiate (mainly heroin) consumption. 

 There seems to be a net spread of these substances in geographical terms with the number of authorities reporting falling levels of consumption of these substances less than those reporting rising levels of use. This does not necessarily mean, however, that the total number of drug users is rising, because increases in smaller countries could be offset by declines in a few larger ones. The strongest ?net increases? (number of countries reporting an increase less those reporting a decline) in 2003 were reported for cannabis herb, cocaine, ATS and the benzodiazepines. With the exception of the benzodiazepines, the ?net increases? in 2003 were lower than those reported in 2001, suggesting that the upward trend in consumption lost momentum. The least frequently reported increases concern substances such as morphine, methaqualone, gamma hydroxy butirate, khat, opium and LSD.

 For the main drug categories of concern, specific drug use trend indices were established. The indicies are based on the trends reported by...authorities and weighted by the size of the countries? drug-using populations. This gives a greater weight to information from countries with a larger drug-using population, thus more accurately reflecting the overall trend at the global level...

 For 2003, these indices show (1) an ongoing increase in the use of cannabis, (2) some signs of stabilization for opiates and cocaine and, (3) a stabilization/decline for ATS. Over the last decade, ATS, followed by cannabis, experienced the strongest increases.

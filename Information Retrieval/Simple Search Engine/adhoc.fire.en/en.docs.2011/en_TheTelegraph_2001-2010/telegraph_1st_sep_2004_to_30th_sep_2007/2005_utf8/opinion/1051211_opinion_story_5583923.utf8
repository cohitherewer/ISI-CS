 APOCALYPSE NOW 

 - We definitely know we are going to warm over the next 300 years

 Indian cities have been struck by unprecedented floods. And cyclone Fanoos is set to hit Tamil Nadu within days of Baaz. Whats going on? The climate is starting to change, reports G.S. Mudur

 EYE OF THE STORM: Changing climate 

 could pull down crop yields and lead to outbreaks of 

 infectious diseases

 A software programmer in Chennai 

 wades through water on the streets, a gift from 

 cyclone Baaz as it struck the east coast. An agricultural 

 scientist in New Delhi scans a pile of data on his table 

 and worries whether, after decades of self-sufficiency in 

 food, India might soon be forced to go on bended knees for 

 wheat. A paediatrician struggles in a village in eastern 

 Uttar Pradesh to save a young child, a victim of what has 

 turned out to be Indias longest and most severe outbreak 

 of Japanese encephalitis, a lethal brain infection. 

 While these might appear unconnected, the worries about wheat, the woes of wading to work, as well as the toll extracted by Japanese encephalitis this year could be portends of a future that India might encounter a lot sooner than anticipated. Some scientists believe theyre snapshots of how things could turn out in the coming years as climate change, induced by human activity, leaps out of academics and into real experience. Indian cities have been struck by unprecedented floods. And cyclone Fanoos is set to hit Tamil Nadu within days of Baaz. 

 Changing climate could make intense weather more common, pull down crop yields and drive the spread of outbreaks of infectious diseases. Not surprisingly, concerns about the impact of the climate change and strategies to get countries ? and their populations ? to gear up for its consequences were among the themes at the 11th UN climate change conference in Montreal, Canada, which ended on Friday. 

 The climate conference assembled more than 8,000 delegates from nearly 190 countries to ponder over the future and negotiate strategies to combat global warming. The message from Montreal is dire: while the world appears to be progressing towards reducing the emissions of the heat-trapping greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide ? produced by the burning of fossil fuels and the clearance of forests ? its happening at a pace at which a certain degree of climate change is inevitable. 

 All countries need to adapt to inevitable impact, said Halldor Thorgeirsson, coordinator for methods, inventories and science at the climate change secretariat. Developing countries will be hardest hit by the impact, Thorgeirsson said. 

 For several years now, the debate in scientific circles has not been on whether climate change is happening, but on how soon and how severe it will be and what impact it will have on human society. 

 The accumulation of greenhouse gases raises average global temperature which could melt glaciers and polar ice caps, adding water to the sea, causing a rise in sea levels. In some areas, warmer temperatures will also mean more rainfall, but, scientists warn, that doesnt necessarily translate into better crop productivity. While the impact will vary around the world, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has estimated that the average rise in the temperature could be between 1.4 and 5.8 ?C. Melting ice from the polar regions is expected to contribute to an 88 cm rise in sea level by the year 2100. 

 But recent studies, including research by Michael Schlesinger at the University of Illinois in the United States presented at a scientific session in Montreal, suggests the price of inaction might be a lot more severe than anticipated. Atmospheric scientist Schlesingers study, for instance, indicates that in the absence of a climate policy, there is a 70 per cent chance that a global ocean circulation called thermohaline will shut down within the next 200 years with disastrous consequences for the northern hemisphere. 

 The thermohaline is a gigantic circulation of oceanic waters, driven by differences in sea-water salinity and temperatures. Warm water from the southern hemisphere flows toward the North Pole. Between Greenland and Norway, the water cools, sinks deep into the ocean, and begins flowing back to the south. But global warming could add fresh water to the northern Atlantic by increasing rainfall by melting Arctic sea ice and the Greenland ice sheet. This influx of fresh water could reduce the surface salinity and density, triggering a shutdown of the thermohaline circulation. This is a dangerous, human-induced climate change, said Schlesinger. 

 His studies show that there is a 45 per cent probability of this occurring in this century itself. The likelihood decreases with mitigation, but even the most rigorous immediate climate policy would still leave a 25 per cent chance of a thermohaline collapse. The shutdown of thermohaline circulation was once thought of as a high-consequence, low-probability event. But our analysis, including the uncertainties in the problem, indicates it is a high-consequence, high-probability event. 

 This oceanic circulation carries an enormous amount of heat into the northern hemisphere and plays a key role in maintaining existing climate. Were the circulation to shut down, the southern hemisphere would become warmer and the northern hemisphere colder. Heavily populated regions of eastern North America and western Europe would experience a signifcant shift in climate, says Schelesinger. 

 His findings have remarkable similarities to the theme of the American film The Day After Tomorrow in which unbridled climate change pushes the northern hemisphere into an era of intense cold, forcing its populations to seek refuge in warmer ? and poorer ? southern hemisphere countries. 

 We definitely know we are going to warm over the next 300 years, says India-born, Chennai-educated physicist Govindasamy Bala, who works at the Lawrence Livemore National Laboratory in the US. The data hes generated in recent months indicate that if humans continue to use fossil fuels in a business-as-usual manner over the next several decades, the consequences might be far worse than imagined. 

 Balas computer simulation of the future climate portrays an earth where sea levels have risen by seven metres, the Arctic tundra has vanished to give way to boreal forests, and carbon dioxide has seeped into the oceans to render the seas acidic. His simulation predicts an eight degree rise in temperature and, by the year 2150, sea ice disappearing in the northern hemisphere during summers. 

 While computer simulations rely on assumptions, uncertainties will persist in such predictions. But agricultural scientist Subramanian Nagarajan at the governments Protection of Plant Variety and Farmers Rights Authority in New Delhi, wonders whether climate change has already begun to affect Indias annual wheat output. 

 Wheat is cultivated as a winter crop in Indias northern grain basket states. But in recent years, says Nagarajan, the average temperatures appear to be interfering with crop growth. 

 High temperatures over the past five years might be leading to yield depression, says Nagarajan. The temperature influences crop duration. A single days growth reduction translates into a 35 kg per hectare loss in yield. If the crop matures a week earlier owing to warm weather towards the harvest, the yield can drop substantially, says Nagarajan. A drop in wheat production during 2003-2004 was attributed to warm weather. 

 Reduced wheat yields might be among the early signals of what global warming will herald for India. A three-year research project supported by the UK government and the Indian ministry of environment and forests has shown that climate change could increase the frequency of intense weather events, radically change the appearance of Indias forests, reduce rice and wheat yields, and create conditions conducive to mosquito-transmitted diseases. 

 At the Indian Agricultural Research Institute in New Delhi, principal investigator Naveen Kalra and his colleagues found that both wheat and rice production could drop as a result of temperature increases. His study found that a two degree rise in temperature would reduce wheat yield in most places. An increase of 2 to 4 degrees would lead to a reduction in rice yield. Indias eastern regions are predicted to be most affected by higher temperatures, resulting in fewer and shorter grains, says Kalras study. 

 As part of the project, physicist Ashesh Prasad Mitra at the National Physical Laboratory in New Delhi investigated the impact of climate change on health in India. A warmer, wetter period will lead to more efficient breeding by mosquitoes. Mitras analysis has shown that by 2080, malaria will have more windows of opportunity at higher latitudes and altitudes. The transmission windows ? the period during which mosquitoes can spread malaria ? in Jammu and Kashmir and Rajasthan are likely to increase by three to five months. 

 Public health experts suspect that other mosquito-borne infections such as Japanese encephalitis will also expand into new territories. The mosquito that spreads Japanese encephalitis breeds in paddy fields which, according to some projections, will become wetter and warmer through climate change. 

 Simulations by Indian meterologists also predict an increase in extreme rainfall ? the type that struck Mumbai this year ? along the basins of the Krishna, the Ganga and the Godavari. The intensity of daily rainfall will also increase. And a study by the National Institute of Oceanography in Goa has hinted at an increased occurrence of cyclones in the Bay of Bengal, particularly during the post-monsoon period, along with an increased maximum wind speed. 

 Progress towards mitigating the effects of climate change by attempts to gradually cut emissions of greenhouse gases is now visible. A new report released on the eve of the Montreal conference said that the developed countries, taken as a group, have achieved sizeable emission reductions. Compared to the 1990 levels, overall greenhouse gas emissions by the developed countries have dropped by 5.9 per cent in 2003. But climate change conference officials emphasise that a large part of these reductions was achieved in the early 1990s by eastern and central European countries undergoing a transition to a market economy. 

 Emissions from developing countries have been stable in recent years and have not decreased as they did in the early 1990s, says Richard Kinley, acting head of the UN climate change secretariat. Morever, greenhouse gas projections indicate the possibility of emission growth by 2010. The Montreal conference adopted a rule book for the controversial Kyoto Protocol, an agreement that came into force in February this year, under which 30 developed countries are bound by specific and legally binding emission reduction targets. Some countries ? the US, for instance ? have not joined the Kyoto Protocol, arguing that even developing countries should set emission reduction targets. 

 All countries agree on the need to act quickly to mitigate the effects of climate change. The arguments are over how to achieve those goals. And the big worry is that the world is moving away from fossil fuels far too slowly.

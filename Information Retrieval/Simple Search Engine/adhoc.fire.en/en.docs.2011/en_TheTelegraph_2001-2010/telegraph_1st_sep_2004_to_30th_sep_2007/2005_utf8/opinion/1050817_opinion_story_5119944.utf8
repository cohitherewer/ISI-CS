 FREE OF DEITIES

 There are two names that inevitably crop up when the prime minister of India addresses the nation on the morning of August 15. One is Jawaharlal Nehru, and the reference most often is to his ?tryst with destiny?? speech. The other is, of course, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, the architect of India?s freedom movement. Mr Manmohan Singh did not fail to pay homage to the moment when Nehru unfurled the flag of independent India on the Red Fort. He also quoted Gandhi?s dream of a swaraj of poor people. To the usual two, Mr Singh added an unusual third. He invoked the memories of the leaders of the uprising of 1857. There was a certain amount of incongruity in the creation of this national pantheon. All the leaders of the 1857 rebellion were anti-modern: all of them harked back to the era of feudal hierarchy. Their aspirations, despite their heroism, were antithetical to the making of a modern nation. The aims and objectives of the great rebellion of 1857 and the goals of the Indian national movement were radically different. Similarly, the significance of 1857 and the significance of Gandhi are not reconcilable since one stood for the violent overthrow of British rule and the other for non-violence. Such incongruities sit uneasily with the erudition of Mr Singh.

 There is an even profounder incongruity which is always sought to be brushed under the carpet. The ideals of Gandhi run counter to the goals that independent India, under Nehru and every successive prime minister, including the present one, set for itself. Gandhi spelt out a utopia of self-regulating and fearless individuals living in self-sustaining village republics. The idea of industrialization was abhorrent to him. How can such a vision co-exist with the idea of India as an industrially powerful nation in tune with global economic trends and driven by the spirit of free enterprise? The mere removal of poverty ? or economic reforms with a human face ? will not lead to the fulfilment of Gandhi?s dream of swaraj. India and its leaders should be honest enough to admit that India has jettisoned that dream and that Gandhi?s utopia is of no relevance in today?s world. Nehru had the courage to say this in his autobiography.

 The incongruity is rooted in the propensity of the Indian political class to pay token homage to the leaders of the national movement. Thus Gandhi is invariably remembered only on his birthday, on Independence Day and on his death anniversary. What is overlooked is that Gandhi was not even present in Delhi when independence was celebrated on August 15, 1947. India is now a mature and robust republic. It should be confident enough to announce its own agenda without any reference to the past. A self-confident and forward-looking nation has no need of token kowtowing to national deities.

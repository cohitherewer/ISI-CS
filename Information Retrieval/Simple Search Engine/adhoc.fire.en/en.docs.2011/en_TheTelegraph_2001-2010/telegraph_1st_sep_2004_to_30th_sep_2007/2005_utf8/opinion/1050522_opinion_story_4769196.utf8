 DIARY

 It?s war in the Congress these days. The khadi topiwallahs have finally come out in the open with their resentment against the savvy, Oxford-Cambridge-Harvard types who rule the roost in the party nowadays. And Jairam Ramesh appears to be the butt of their ire. A member of the UPA steering committee, Ramesh was ticked off recently by Anand Sharma for chatting jovially while he was making a forceful point during a debate ? parliament is not a ?club? and needs to be taken more seriously. Earlier, too, Ramesh had been reprimanded as if he were an errant schoolboy by Janardhan Dwivedi, for a similar reason. But scold as they might, the old guard is no match for this articulate and telegenic batch of Congressmen. The former might have a mass-base and win elections but that doesn?t get them anywhere with the smart set in the national capital. Or in the good books of Rahul Gandhi, the Congress?s face of the future. It?s the Rameshes the young man sees more of, and who are presumed to be tutoring him in all that?ll be needed of him when he claims his legacy. Presumably, it?s this factor that has irked the topiwallahs the most, prompting them to complain to his ma, party boss Sonia Gandhi, that Rahul would be better off keeping his ears glued to the ground. But it doesn?t seem to have had a sobering effect on Ramesh since he can be seen a lot at 2 Motilal Nehru Marg, the address frequented by Sonia and others. No wonder, Ramesh can be seen smiling as much as every these days.

 Never say die, that?s our Laloo Prasad Yadav. He hasn?t allowed anything to get him down ? neither the loss of Patna after 15 years of lording it over, the storm in parliament over the ?taint? on him, nor his growing differences with the Congress. Which is also why he is on the lookout for life beyond the UPA. And who better to turn to than Mulayam Singh Yadav, as much at loggerheads with the Congress as Laloo? As far as Laloo is concerned, minor irritants like his recent cold vibes with Mulayam can be forgotten in the warm memories of the heyday of the Third Front experiments of 1989 and 1997, whose two pillars the two Yadav chieftains were. So friendly overtures have been made and returned in equal measure. The two leaders have talked over the phone, and their lieutenants, Devendra Yadav and Ram Gopal Yadav, have parleyed behind closed doors during the recent budget session. Lines of communication have been opened with other players like the DMK, TDP, NCP and even the left. All this could mean trouble for Manmohan Singh, but it?s anyone?s guess how such a rag-tag bunch can be held together by nothing but one man?s desperation to save his skin.

 If Pranab Mukherjee expected to get much sympathy for being roughed up by and, in turn, roughing up party-workers in Calcutta, he was in for a disappointment. Whatever Ambika Soni might have said during the official part of her press briefing, in her off-the-record interactions with the media, she could barely hide her smile as she said that as a senior minister, Pranabda should stop behaving like the youth Congress guys. Now we know why no one likes Soni. 

 Ministers in the UPA cabinet seem to love shooting themselves in the foot. First there was Pranab Mukherjee giving a clean chit to George Fernandes in sundry defence deals. And now keeping him company is Suresh Pachauri, whose ministry of personnel was on the verge of giving the post of additional director, CBI, to the brother of Rajiv Pratap Rudy, BJP member of the erstwhile NDA cabinet. The ministry backtracked out of that one at the very last moment, but Pachauri has stirred up a real storm with his statements that the CBI was an autonomous body and that the UPA did not interfere in its functioning. In the context in which these comments were made ? the CBI questioning of Mayavati, whose BSP supports the UPA ? they were taken to mean that the government had failed to rein in the CBI. Now that?s really not the way democracy functions in India, is it? 

 How young is young in politics? It depends. If you are in the Congress or the BJP, it would probably be around 50, but if you?re in a left party, anything below 70 and you?re a spring chicken. Thus, Sonia Gandhi?s directive to her party-workers to elect ?younger? state unit chiefs has 60 as the outside age limit. And then too, there are some like Jagadambika Pal who want to contest, despite being much older than 60. Just goes to show that you may be too old for a lot of things but you are never too old to cheat.

 Maneka Gandhi would definitely not have approved. In fact, had she known that 3 Motilal Nehru Marg, the official residence of Shahnawaz Hussein when he was part of the earlier ministry, had a full-fledged kabootar khana, filled with dozens of bird-cages, she would probably have mounted a raid on it. The presence of the aviary has only just come to light with Hussein moving out and Ajit Jogi moving in. It was the former Chattisgarh CM?s son, Amit, who made the discovery. But he was disappointed to find that all the cages were empty and that the only proof of the presence of the birds was the foul smell of droppings. Given Jogi Jr?s reputation as a gourmand, had he found any birds, one can be sure that they would have landed up on his table. Did the birds then have a narrow escape? No, perhaps. For methinks one can discern in the kabootar khana the reason why Hussein had a reputation as an excellent host.

 Letters to Editor

 Blame game

 Sir ? ?Sania steers clear of pre-marital sex row? (Nov 19), and why not? It was enough to finish Kushboo?s successful career in the Tamil film industry. And the media, who have done enough harm by concentrating on Mirza?s skirt-length, obviously, want the row to work the same wonders for her. Such ?controversies? are directly attributable to the fact that there are few people with any real interests, be it in films or sports. Worse, the media have to cater to them. Should we then blame Mirza for evading the trap laid out by the media?

 Yours faithfully,

 Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Raising a stink

 Sir ? As the report, ?Oil crusader gunned down? (Nov 22), noted, a year before B. Manjunathan was killed to thwart his crusade against corrupt petrol dealers, another of his kind, Satyendra Dubey ? just as highly-qualified, forthright and honest as Manjunathan ? had been killed in cold blood. Dubey, like the Indian Oil Corporation executive, had tried to break the vicious cycle of corruption that had siphoned off, as he claimed, some crores from the National Highway Authority of India. Let us hope the death of these two valiant men will not be in vain. Since it is the businessmen-mafia-administration nexus that is responsible for the corruption, the vigilance commission should be given a free hand and adequate infrastructure to undo it.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Sudarsan Nandi, Midnapore 

 Sir ? Both B. Manjunathan and Satyendra Dubey were from India?s premier institutions ? one from the Indian Institute of Management, and the other the Indian Institute of Technology. Now both are dead because they had been valiant and optimistic. Is it any surprise that India?s brightest aspire to go overseas and escape adulteration of their dreams and talent? India is today a haven of hooligans like Dubey?s and Manjunathan?s killers. I hope parents stop their children from opting for government jobs, especially those in the public sector units, where anyone who desists from conforming to the ?system? runs the risk of being killed.

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Datta, Calcutta

 Sir ? In a country bereft of role models, B. Manjunathan will stand out as a sterling example to our youth. If only 20 per cent of our youth were fired with their ideals like Manjunathan had been, this country would not have come to such a pass. Indian consumers should raise their voice in defence of their rights and strengthen the moral might of others like Manjunathan. Our prime minister paid tribute to Maniappan Raman Kutty, the Indian driver who lost his life in Afghanistan. He should have done the same to Manjunathan.

 Yours faithfully,

Amajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir ? The sordid killing of the IOC employee once again shows that raising a voice against wrongdoings in this country can be dangerous. Government agencies might be worried about corrupt practices in various spheres of life but their stance smacks of hypocrisy, given that it is not backed by any safety net for the people who are asked to fight against corruption. Manjunathan?s death will corrode the confidence of the younger generation in their ability to wage a war against evil practices.

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Bhavapur, UP

 Sir ? If the government and its PSU, the IOC, is serious about the brief it gives to employees to fight ?corruption? and stop malpractices by petroleum dealers, it should not let B. Manjunathan?s killers get away with a few days in prison and a lifetime on bail. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Sumant Poddar, Calcutta

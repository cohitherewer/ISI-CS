 Letters to Editor

 Designs unveiled

 Sir ? When it comes to American intervention, history repeats itself with depressing frequency (?Scarf scourge reaches Iraq?, Dec 31). In driving the Soviets out of Afghanistan, the United States of America trained and funded the resistance then known as Mujahedin, later evolving into taliban. As soon as the Soviets withdrew, the Americans washed their hands of that country. Everyone knows what happened to the women of Afghanistan after that. Even now, after the so-called democratic elections, the place of women is behind the purdah. This cycle is being repeated in Iraq. Women who never needed to cover up earlier are now forced to do so. Strange are the ways of liberation, which brings only repression and suffering on Iraqi women. And after the elections take place, the US, with its oil interests in place, will go back sparing no thought for these newly-veiled women.

 Yours faithfully,

Amit Banerjee, Calcutta

 All roads closed

 Sir ? The Annual Business Seminar, organized by the Consular Corps jointly with business leaders, is a unique annual event in the Calcutta calendar. Diplomats and business leaders felt the need for such a seminar to overcome the needlessly negative image of West Bengal and Calcutta as investment destinations. George Sibley, the US consul general, was the chairman of the business seminar held recently, and drew a fine balance between confidence and concern in his address. But while we should be happy at the confidence displayed by diplomats and business leaders, we should also take heed of the concerns expressed. On balance is an enormous surge of confidence in the state and the government headed by Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. The seminar emphasized the widely-held view that the desire for growth, progress and development is not the monopoly of any particular sector or political thought. The same sentiment was also expressed by the Japanese ambassador in a separate meeting with business leaders. Should we risk this enormous goodwill by adhering to the bandh culture? 

 While we have every right to be proud of our robust democracy, we must remember that while India is the world?s largest functioning democracy, it is not the only democracy in the world. It is true that protest is an inherent and vital element of democratic freedom, but surely, as other countries have demonstrated, the only way of recording protest is not by disabling an entire city or an entire state. Are we not belittling our own potential by displaying to the world that we have such little concern for our potential as to believe that a loss of an entire day is of no concern? Is this not an unjustified admission that our achievements are so small that a day counts for nothing? If we belittle our own potential, how can we expect others to recognize it? I do not of course mention the loss to daily earners and the inconvenience to the public. Ironically, the last bandh on December 3 was organized on a day which was dedicated the world over to the concern for the disabled. We celebrated this day by disabling our entire city. If protest is to be recorded in a formal manner, would it not be more effective to do so, perhaps, by blowing strategically placed sirens for a full minute at noon on the day of protest?

 Yours faithfully,

Pesi M. Narielvala, Calcutta

 Sir ? Perhaps the time has come for us to seriously consider our feelings towards bandhs. Of course there is a section of people who ideologically support the cause behind a bandh, but these days, a vast majority prefers to stay in on a bandh day for fear of violence. Though the statistics of the last few bandhs provide no basis for such fear, people are still anxious, nervous and apprehensive. They tend to give excuses and refuse to admit the fear. Acknowledging this to oneself is perhaps the first step to cross the imaginary hurdle we set ourselves. For even minor political parties are taking advantage of this strange inertness of the people of Bengal. It seems to me that bandhs are no more a political or legal issue than a psychological one.

 Yours faithfully,

Sekhar Basu Mallik, Calcutta

 Sir ? I remember it was the communists who pioneered the trend of bandhs in West Bengal. I have seen working persons fret at home and fume against the Communist Party of India (Marxist), but not venturing out, lest they are spotted by CPI(M) goons. The Trinamool Congress has merely taken the tradition forward, adding a little more illogicality to the whole thing. It is sad that even the educated among our politicians endorse such unreasonable disruption of public life. 

 Even more ironical is that there has not been a single bandh which has made the government change its policies. We are on the threshold of economic revival, and the chief minister is sincerely trying to improve work culture in the state. The good-for-nothing trade unions have no business neutralizing these efforts through gimmicks like chakka bandh. But even as I say this, I harbour no hopes that my letter will change the hearts of the votaries of bandh-culture.

 Yours faithfully,

Murli Punjabi, Calcutta

 SQUATTED OUT

 Turning back can sometimes be as difficult as going on. Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee must have faced a dilemma when he chose not to go ahead with the eviction of the squatters on railway tracks in south Calcutta. It is pointless to split hairs on whether it was a surrender or a tactical retreat by the government. And there is almost a pathetic ring to the squatters? celebrations. They know that their lives on the edges of the tracks would continue to be as unsafe and uncertain as ever. Even the Trinamool Congress?s claim of a political victory sounds spurious. Both the party?s resistance and the government?s retreat were clearly influenced by the possible political impact the eviction could have had on the coming elections to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. Given the threat of violence and bloodshed, it made sense for the government not to push through the drive. It is difficult to assume, though, that the government did not anticipate the resistance. Another attempt at evicting the squatters had failed in 2002. Clearly, even if the government had decided to attempt the eviction in order to abide by an order of the Calcutta high court, it seemed uncertain about its political wisdom. 

 But neither Mr Bhattacharjee nor Ms Mamata Banerjee can so easily set aside the larger issues involved in the failed move. The legal issue is the most obvious one. No matter what their numbers are or how long they are living in the area, there is no doubt that the squatters are illegally occupying the railway?s land. The high court?s order was thus a directive to the government to honour its constitutional obligation to ensure the rule of law. It can only be an ominous sign if the politics of threats and blackmails is allowed to subvert the law. But then, all parties hope to thrive on such politics. Historically, the communists have been the strongest champions of refugees from erstwhile East Pakistan who encroached on public land to set up their illegal colonies. If the burden of governance forces them today to sing a different tune, their legacy lives on in the politics of the Trinamool Congress. Ms Banerjee?s demand for the rehabilitation of the squatters before they are evicted has its roots in the same politics. She cannot be unaware that any government that meets the demand will open a Pandora?s box. Considering the messy finances of the state government, it would be simply unrealistic for it to jump into any such venture. Ultimately, however, Mr Bhattacharjee has to choose between the logic of development and the compulsions of street politics.

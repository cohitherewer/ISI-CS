 SIGNPOST

 How open are India?s policies on foreign direct investment? The answer depends on the sector. In manufacturing, the policy is fairly open. But Press Note 18 requires prospective foreign investors, in similar or related lines of business, to obtain no objection certificates from existing Indian joint venture partners, even if the joint venture is defunct. There have been instances where such dead partners have blocked fresh investment proposals or obtained premiums. The onus of proving that there will not be any adverse effects on the joint venture is on the foreign investor. While such potential conflicts of interest are possible, these are commercial issues that ought to be taken care of contractually rather than through mandated government policy. Indeed, global commercial contracts have such cooling off provisions. 

 At the Confederation of Indian Industry?s 11th partnership summit in Calcutta, the prime minister labelled Press Note 18 as an anachronism that has outlived its utility and announced its scrapping. Anachronism suggests a policy that is ancient. However, Press Note 18 dates to 1998 only and was inserted at the behest of industry associations that feared foreign competition. And the industry associations? argument was bolstered by leftist elements that opposed FDI generically. That the United Progressive Alliance has succeeded (despite left support to it and opposition to the withdrawal of Press Note 18) where the National Democratic Alliance failed, is welcome. However, the UPA has not scrapped Press Note 18 in its entirety, which is what should have been done. Instead, provisions have been diluted and NOCs will not be required for dead joint ventures, or completely new joint ventures. But existing and alive joint ventures will still confront Press Note 18, which should keep protectionist elements in the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry happy. 

 However, it will not apply to venture capital funds registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India or to instances where the stakes of both Indian and foreign partners are less than 3 per cent and the burden of proof for establishing adverse impact (or no such impact) on existing joint ventures will vest with both the foreign and the Indian partners equally. Because several existing joint ventures will continue to be covered by Press Note 18, the immediate impact on FDI inflows will not be much. But there is no denying the positive signal imparted. Effectively, the government has adopted a grand-fathering option, retaining the Press Note for several existing joint ventures that are alive, but scrapping it for future ones. That seems to be a sensible way of handling the political economy of resistance in other reform areas as well.

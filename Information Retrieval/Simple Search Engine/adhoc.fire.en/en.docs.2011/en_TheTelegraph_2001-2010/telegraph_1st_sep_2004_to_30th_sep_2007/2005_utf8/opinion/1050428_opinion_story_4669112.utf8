 LOGIC OF THINGS

 It is always risky to predict the outcome of a political gamble. It is possible, however, to try and see the logic behind it. Mr Subrata Mukherjee?s reason for revolting against the Trinamool Congress chief, Ms Mamata Banerjee, is simple enough. It is difficult to dispute his argument that the only way to defeat the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in the elections in Bengal is to bring together all parties, including the Congress, that are opposed to the Marxists. A splintered opposition is one of the factors that have helped the CPI(M)-led Left Front rule the state for 28 long years. Even Ms Banerjee, who saw in Mr Mukherjee?s move a conspiracy to break her party, joined hands with the Congress during the assembly elections in the state in 2001. How the same political logic has now become unacceptable to her is not quite clear. True, a significant change took place in national politics in the meantime. The Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre is dependent on the left?s support for its survival. How can she now make common cause with the Congress that runs the Union government with the support of her communist enemies? And, the 2001 elections in Bengal proved, she argues, that even a Congress-Trinamool alliance was not enough to dislodge the left from power. 

 The apparent merits notwithstanding, her arguments are seriously flawed. No matter what the arrangements are at the Centre, the Congress and the left continue to be major political rivals, particularly in the three states of West Bengal, Kerala and Tripura. It would surely be the Congress?s strategy to try and reduce its dependence on the left at the national level. That can happen only if the Congress can improve its position in the three left strongholds. Also, the party?s return to power in New Delhi offers it new opportunities to regain lost ground in the states. It should be the right time, therefore, for her to build bridges with the Congress again. For, no anti-CPI(M) front would be worth the attempt unless it had the Congress in it. Even if a tie-up with the Congress did not work in 2001, it remains the most viable option for Ms Banerjee. By comparison, her alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party, as the last Lok Sabha polls proved, brought her no cheers. True, despite his good work as the mayor of Calcutta, Mr Mukherjee does not quite match her in popularity. But his method has more political logic in it.

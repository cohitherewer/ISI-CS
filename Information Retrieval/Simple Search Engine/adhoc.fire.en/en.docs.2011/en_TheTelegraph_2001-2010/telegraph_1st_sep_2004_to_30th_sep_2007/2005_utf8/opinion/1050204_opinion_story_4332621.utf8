 STEPPED UP

 The quid pro quo between hike in the employees? provident fund rate and hike in foreign direct investment in telecommunications is obvious. With budget 2005-06 drawing near, the government must have been conscious of not having delivered on the finance minister?s promise in the last budget of raising FDI in telecom from 49 per cent to 74 per cent. Opposition came from both the left and the home ministry, the latter because of perceived security concerns. The left has been mollified by the increase in the EPF rate to 9.5 per cent from 8.5 per cent, that too, with retrospective effect from 2002-03. The crux of the tussle between the finance and labour ministries, labour toeing the left line, is conceptual. Should there be guaranteed administratively-determined rates of return on EPF, mandatory for all establishments that employ more than 20 people? The answer should be in the negative. Returns to investors should be a function of the returns the Employees? Provident Fund Organisation generates, with individual investors free to park their savings in alternative instruments. The existing EPFO monopoly prevents this choice. Since this first-best solution stands rejected, there is only the option of administratively-guaranteed returns and deciding what that rate should be. 

 By any yardstick of inflation, 9.5 per cent represents a real rate of return of plus 3.5 per cent. This is not only excessive. It also represents a cross-subsidy and regressive transfer from the rest of the economy (that includes the Indian poor) to those who are covered by EPF. (Labour ministry and finance ministry figures only differ on the extent of this subsidy.) The prime minister has reportedly given ?careful consideration? to the left?s demand for the hike. The prime minister and cabinet have decided that this is a small price to pay for the FDI hike in telecom and the national electricity policy. Security concerns in telecom are addressed through numerous caveats, including clauses about Indian legal jurisdiction and barring companies from operating in selected geographical areas. Transparency has also been imparted to the policy, by removing opportunities for bypassing the 49 per cent cap. While telecom has been a success story of reforms, shakeout and consolidation are overdue. The existing policy also constrained desirable exit.

 The telecom sector needs substantial investments to boost the subscriber base from the present 90 million to 250 million by 2007. There will certainly be some additional foreign investor interest. But the FDI cap was not the only constraint. There are problems with spectrum frequency allocation and access deficit charges. However, the objective of imparting a positive signal about the United Progressive Alliance?s reform credentials has been partly attained.

 VELVET FIST

 India?s apparent inability to manage its relationship with its immediate neighbours has often invited widespread criticism. The recent articulation by the foreign secretary, Mr Shyam Saran, of a clear policy towards south Asia and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation should, therefore, be welcomed. Despite India?s aspirations of being a great power, and its growing military and economic strength, New Delhi?s diplomatic failures in the south Asian region have greatly undermined its international standing. Indeed, India?s continuing problems with Pakistan and Bangladesh and the recent crises in Nepal are viewed internationally as reflective of an ad hocist Indian foreign policy towards its neighbours. There is, in fact, a strong perception that India may not have a well thought out strategic view of the south Asian region. 

 Mr Saran, fortunately, has provided a necessary corrective. The foreign secretary made three valuable arguments which could form the basis of a long-term vision for the south Asian region. First, he pointed out that it was important for India to be viewed by its neighbours as an opportunity rather than as a threat. India is one of the fastest growing economies. It constitutes not only a vast and growing market, but is also a competitive source of technologies and knowledge-based services. The whole south Asian region can benefit from these opportunities. India?s size can be a source of strength for the whole region. Second, the foreign secretary also laid down a vision for a new south Asia with world class infrastructure, common institutions and cross-border economic arrangements leading towards a truly vibrant and globally competitive South Asian Economic Community. To create this, the foreign secretary declared that India was prepared to take greater responsibility based on a principle of non-reciprocity. India was willing to make unilateral concessions to accommodate the smaller economies of the region, whether it be in free-trade zones or other bilateral or multilateral arrangements. Finally, he emphasized that a new and vibrant south Asia could be created only if India?s neighbours gave up their permanent hostility and suspicion towards India. The smaller states of south Asia should not use institutions like the SAARC only as fora to embarrass India or to gang up against it. Moreover, as India was prepared to make unilateral concessions and open up its market, the smaller neighbours must also show greater sensitivity to Indian interests. 

 In recent memory no foreign secretary has put forward a clearer blueprint of India?s attitudes and plans for the region. The statement needs to be translated into policy and the message conveyed to all south Asian capitals.

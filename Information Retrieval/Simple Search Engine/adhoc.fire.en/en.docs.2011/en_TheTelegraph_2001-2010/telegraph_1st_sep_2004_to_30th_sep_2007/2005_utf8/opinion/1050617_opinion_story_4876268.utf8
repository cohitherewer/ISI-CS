 FIRST ROUND

 India cannot be ruled by a party preaching hatred and discrimination. This simple and self-evident truth has been discovered by Mr L.K. Advani rather late in his political career. This discovery marks a radical departure from the mantra that he imbibed as a loyal and lifelong member of the sangh parivar. Mr Advani?s various statements in Pakistan, which have stirred a hornets? nest within the Bharatiya Janata Party and in the rest of the Hindutva parivar, had the wider aim of refashioning the BJP and Mr Advani?s own image. It is significant that the comments came from Mr Advani known to be a champion of Hindutva and as the man who had revived the fortunes of the BJP through his rath yatra. From Hindutva and its politics of exclusion, Mr Advani, through his various recent statements, was attempting to project a vision for the BJP which would make it more inclusive and therefore more acceptable. His first step was to place governance above ideology: witness his speech to the Confederation of Indian Industries. He followed this up by his speeches in Pakistan, especially when he spoke in praise of M.A. Jinnah, and accepted the reality of Pakistan. These suggested two things. One was that Mr Advani had broken from some of the vital aspects of the creed of the sangh parivar; and second was his eagerness to start a debate within an organization that was frozen in time.

 A right royal rumpus followed. The sangh parivar attacked Mr Advani viciously, he resigned from the post of BJP president, and later withdrew the resignation after the party described his Pakistan visit as historic. But only those blessed with innocence believed that the matter was closed and that a defiant Mr Advani had been tamed and has returned as a loyalist to the fold. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad continues to be strident in its repudiation of Mr Advani and the latter remains unrepentant and is steadfast in his refusal to recant from the views that he articulated in Pakistan. In a speech on Wednesday, Mr Advani, with great astuteness, summoned to his defence the views of Deen Dayal Upadhyaya, one of the icons of the sangh parivar. It is obvious that Mr Advani has made a tactical retreat in a battle but he has no intentions of giving up the war.

 The key issues of this war are evident. Mr Advani is committed to reforming the BJP and to bringing it into the mainstream of Indian political life and debate. The sangh parivar and large sections of the BJP are not amenable to Mr Advani?s reform agenda. They want to cling to an ideology that has lost all relevance. Mr Advani?s critics do not realize that by opposing reform they are only delaying the inevitable. If the BJP is to avoid going into premature vanaprastha, it will have to reform itself. Saying no to reform is to say yes to obscurity. When the reform does happen, Mr Advani will be remembered as its patron saint.

 Letters to Editor

 Failing the test

 Sir ? It cannot be denied that the introduction of the two-step exams and the ?Kota rush? have not been encouraging developments for the Indian Institutes of Technology. However one doubts if the changes prescribed by the government can solve the problem (?Seal on IIT format?, Sept 18). No matter how much the authorities change the JEE format, the coaching centres are going to adapt to it and start training the students accordingly. The more serious problem, however, has been overlooked. Most of the students now come to the IITs in the lure of an assured job and not for the love of engineering or science. Most of those who clear the JEE in fact have no idea of the courses they get into or what might interest them. Which is why the new rule that debars entrants from changing departments is so harmful. The least the IITs can do is provide a comprehensive view of the courses offered. The prospectus sent out to students presently has minimal information.

 Yours faithfully,

Arunabh Kumar, Kharagpur

 Sir ? The cut-off marks for taking the IIT entrance examination should be specified at 75 per cent, since insistence on a mere 60 per cent is unlikely to make much of a difference. The enhanced percentage will ensure that there is less competition and hence less disappointment at the admission level in the IITs. 

 Yours faithfully,

Mahesh Kapasi, New Delhi

 Sir ? I am about to sit for the JEE 2006 examination and believe that the greatest sufferers in this sudden change are the students themselves. The coaching centres may be able to adapt themselves to the change but the aspirants do not have enough time. Besides, BTech and related courses are technical areas which require a different curriculum from BSc and related courses which aim towards research. The CBSE-NCERT syllabus caters to the latter and not the former.

 Yours faithfully,

Abhishek Dey Das, Calcutta

 Sir ? No matter how much the government may try to make the IIT-JEE equitable, the bias will clearly be in favour of the urban student population. While the latter start preparing for the exams after class X, those in the semi-urban and rural areas cannot stand up to the challenge. Besides, the environment where one can study 12 hours-a-day uninterrupted is available only to urban students who have electricity and other facilities. Students from the backward areas will now be under tremendous pressure since they will have only two chances to crack the JEE. 

 Yours faithfully,

Satyadhar Joshi, Indore

 Sir ? Today students have lost the habit of reading textbooks, journals and periodicals. They heavily depend only on ?guides? and coaching-class booklets for ?knowledge?. The changes in the JEE rules are thus welcome. But most important is the change in the test itself. Negative marking for incorrect answers should be increased to deter guesswork. 

 Yours faithfully,

Harishchandra Parashuram, Mumbai

 Sir ? The government has decided that from next year students sitting for the IIT admission test should get at least 60 per cent in their class XII examination. By implication, this means that IIT exams are to be conducted only after the board examination results are published. Students must be given time to make their applications after that. The scrutiny of the applications, issue of roll numbers, announcement of date of examination can follow only after this is done. Won?t that inordinately delay the entrance examination and thereby the engineering session? Further, what if the results of any board examination in the country are delayed? 

 Yours faithfully,

K.B. Goswami, Calcutta

 Sir ? The IITs, modelled on the Massachussets Institute of Technology in the US, are known for their global brand and the criterion of a first division for entrants is thus reasonable. The new rules will restore the importance of the class XII board examination. Besides, two attempts are good enough for an enterprising candidate to crack the examination. 

 Yours faithfully,

J.S. Acharya, Hyderabad

 Sir ? The report, ?IIT test tied to board result? (Sept 13), says that presently an IIT student can shift from one IIT to another. But that is hardly the case. Once a student is admitted to an IIT, he is not allowed, under any circumstances, to shift on the basis of his academic result. How can the government now say that it is putting a bar on a system which does not exist? Second, the report talks of a Lucknow IIT. Till date, there are seven Indian Institutes of Technology located at Kharagpur, Bombay (Powai), Delhi, Madras, Kanpur, Guwahati and Roorkee. 

 Yours faithfully,

Atanu Basak, Kharagpur

 Sir ? The government has been arguing that the changes in the IIT entrance system will reduce examination-related stress. I believe they will do just the opposite. The syllabi of class XII is very different from what one needs to go through to prepare for the IIT entrance test. So students will be torn between the plus two examination and the more crucial IIT entrance. 

 Yours faithfully,

Md. Mudassir Alam, New Delhi

 Sir ? The proposed upgradation of several existing engineering colleges to IITs is a political gimmick. The IITs are being used to offer sops to state governments. The other proposed reforms also betray a hastily drawn-up policy. The idea of having 60 per cent in board exams will pose problems for students from boards like Bihar and Madhya Pradesh, where even the toppers barely get beyond the 60 per cent mark. Having one main exam will make it difficult to award ranks to students. Those who get into the IITs with low ranks would be in a vulnerable position as the proposed reforms would bar them from opting for a change of department and from contesting the JEE again. 

 Yours faithfully,

Saurabh Sinha, Kharagpur

 Sir ? The restriction of 60 per cent marks is hogwash as those gaining admission into the IITs have almost certainly been among the toppers in their school. Second, it?s unfair to deny anyone who has got into an IIT the chance to change his department through another test. Students often cannot make a judicious decision when they enter the institution.

 Yours faithfully,

Soumya Kundu and Tapas Kuila, Kharagpur

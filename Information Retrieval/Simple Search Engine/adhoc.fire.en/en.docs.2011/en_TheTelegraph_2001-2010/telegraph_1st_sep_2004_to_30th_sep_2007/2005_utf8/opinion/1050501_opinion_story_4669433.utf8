 Letters to Editor

 Not having to say sorry

 Sir ? We obviously cannot expect Romi Dev to come on television and swear, between sobs, that she has done nothing wrong by setting up business in an illegally constructed building (?House that felled Kapil wife?, April 29). But she could try that time-tested tactic too. It worked for her husband. It could work for her as well. But then hers is a sin more common than her husband?s. In a city that has thrown all civic norms to the winds in the mad pace of growth, there will be Romi Devs on every street.

 Yours faithfully,

 S. Mahapatra, Calcutta

 Less of More

 Sir ?The rape of a minor by a constable inside a police outpost on Marine Drive is a slap on the face of the Mumbai police administration (?Rape on Marine Drive?, April 22). This shows that people cannot trust cops, notwithstanding the campaigns to facilitate public-police interface. Sunil More, the culprit, is likely to get away lightly as rape is not punishable by death under Indian law. Perhaps, there is a case for reconsidering the death penalty in such cases so that depraved men like More can be deterred. 

 The police also need to mull over a few things. Where would people go if the police themselves turn to crime? What is the purpose of setting up police kiosks and mobile vans, when women are being raped inside them? Will errant policemen be punished for their crimes? The answers may help the police to perform their duties better. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Sumant Poddar, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The Marine Drive rape case should not end up as another statistic in the country?s crime-graph. The incident calls for a thorough inquiry, rather than cosmetic measures like transfers and suspensions. The facts clearly show that the internal control mechanisms in the force have collapsed. Sunil More had reported for work in an inebriated condition, and this was not the first time he had done so. Why was More, possibly an alcoholic, allowed to continue in the force? Internal discipline should be enforced. Maybe, it would be a good idea to outsource some of the functions performed by an already over-worked force.

 On the legal side, the government needs to reform the rules pertaining to rape. These should be heard by women judges only, and in their private chambers, in the presence of the victim?s lawyer. When there is little doubt about the evidence, as is the case with More, the sentence should be passed quickly to reduce the victim?s agony. 

 Yours faithfully,

V. Ramachandran, Mumbai

 Sir ? The views expressed in Saamna on the Marine Drive rape merit serious concern (?Behave or get raped? April 26). Nowadays, women seem bold enough to flaunt skimpy clothes and show off their skin. Smoking is very fashionable among them. Yet, little do they know that smartness has more to do with one?s intellect and conduct than clothes or the lack of them. 

 However, one cannot absolve men totally of crimes against women. We often find men misbehaving even when their female victims are dressed appropriately. Perhaps the Shiv Sena, while railing against women?s dress sense, should have admonished men as well? 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Sharmi Adhikary, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The Shiv Sena seems to think that only women who wear skimpy clothes are raped. Then why do girls, sometimes as young as ten-year-olds, get raped by men? Why is it that rural women, who generally dress in a traditional manner, get raped as well? The Sena-speak is likely to further embolden criminals. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Rashmi Jaiswal, Howrah

 FAIR AND TRUE

 It is not impossible to save democracy from cynical politicians. Ironically, this message of hope now comes from Bihar, which has long been the state of despair. The Election Commission can legitimately claim the credit for this turnaround. That the EC?s tough measures worked were amply proved in the first round of the assembly polls in the state. Rarely in recent decades had elections in Bihar been so peaceful and free from violence. It is easy to see, therefore, why politicians of the ruling alliance are so upset with the EC. The rift between the EC and these politicians has come to a head over the arrest warrant issued against the Union minister of state for water resources, Mr Jaiprakash Narayan Yadav. As it happened with Mr Shibu Soren?s resignation from the Union cabinet, Mr Yadav?s case has come as a major embarrassment for the United Progressive Alliance government. But the UPA?s complaints about the EC officials? conduct in Bihar seem to be motivated by the alliance?s own political compulsions. In these elections, the UPA faces its first crucial political test since the last Lok Sabha polls. The Supreme Court?s strictures on the conduct of Bihar?s governor, Mr Buta Singh, in the aftermath of the last elections were also an indictment of the UPA government. The results of the elections this time are thus of crucial importance to both Bihar and the Centre. 

 How the EC conducts the polls in Bihar has a much wider significance. Bihar may provide the worst examples of the subversion of the rule of law and of electoral democracy. The state also illustrates the most vicious kind of the criminal-politician nexus. But it is by no means the only state where politicians steal the people?s vote at gunpoint. In other states too, politicians and their armed militias routinely turn elections into a time of terror for ordinary people. If they still fail to completely destroy the democratic process, it is because of the people?s faith in the system and their courage to uphold it despite the odds. How the EC carries out its responsibility will largely determine if the people would be free to choose their governments. After all, it is the fate of the democratic system, rather than of a political party or alliance, that is at stake in the elections. But the EC has a duty to prove that its role and actions are above board. It must not only be, but also appear to be, fair and true to the law.

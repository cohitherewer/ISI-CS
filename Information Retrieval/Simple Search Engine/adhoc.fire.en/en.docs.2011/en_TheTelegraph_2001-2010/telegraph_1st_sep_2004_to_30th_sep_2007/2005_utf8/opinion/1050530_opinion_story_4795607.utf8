 Letters to Editor

 Shadow of perversion

 Sir ? I was in Calcutta recently. One evening, I took my fianc? to the Rabindra Sarobar lakes. We were sitting on one of the concrete benches by the water, near the Safari Park, when some old men came and demanded that we give up our seats, since they sat on those every day. We refused, as we thought their demand was illegal. And then they started harassing us, first by abusing, and then by making sexually explicit remarks. When we appeared unfazed, they called some young men who nearly molested me. We had no option but to leave the place. On another occasion, again in the same area, we saw old men watching us closely, lest we violated the ?decency? of the public place. We saw them getting after teenaged couples. Through its bizarre move of banning umbrellas in public parks, the state government has played into the hands of these perverted elements of our society.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sreemoti Dev, Reseda, US

 On your marks

 Sir ? After reading the reports of the results of board examinations, I have come to believe that The Telegraph focuses only on the performances of city schools. It believes, perhaps, that district schools cannot complete with the city schools.

 Therefore, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that St Patrick?s Higher Secondary School, Asansol has achieved outstanding results in both the Indian Council for Secondary Education and Indian School Certificate examinations. In the ICSE examination, Shamik Ray scored 96.5 per cent, taking all the six subjects. His score is 97.4 per cent when the best five subjects is taken. In the ISC examination, Shayak Lahiri has scored 97.4 per cent in the best four subjects of the science stream.

 I hope you will take these into account and in future, cover the district schools, because sometimes, they achieve better results than many city schools. 

 Yours faithfully,

Seema Paul, principal, St Patrick?s H.S. School, Asansol

 Sir ? Several students have been left in shock after the results of the Central Board for Secondary Education and All-India Senior Secondary Certificate Examination were declared. Those who expected marks in the range of 80 to 90 per cent in particular subjects, have got in the 60s and 70s. And this has not happened to candidates from all over the country, but to a batch of 60 students from a particular school in Shillong. The disclaimer on the website does warn us against ?inadvertent errors?, but can there be so many errors? And all of them with students from the same school? And in the same subject? Something is definitely amiss.

 The subject in which this happened is English, although many students have got disappointing marks in mathematics and biology too. If the fault lies with the examiners, they should be pulled up for it. But what about the poor students? Will they be re-evaluated? Will the CBSE even admit that there may have been a mistake? Even if there is re-evaluation, it is going to take four or five weeks at least, by which time most colleges will have completed their admission procedure. Is Ashok Ganguly, the CBSE chairman, listening? 

 Yours faithfully,

A.K. Sengupta, Shillong

 Sir ? It was with a deep sense of regret that I read ?Failure clouds results high? (May 20). It is obvious that The Telegraph has selected a few schools and pulled them up for ?poor results?. Getting candidates through is an uphill task, so a failure or two in a few institutions should not undermine the over-all performance of students in the hill schools.

 In most of the boarding schools in the hills ? and with my experience in Goethals ? private tuition is not the order of the day. The boys maintain their grades without the help of a tutor on a daily basis. The strategy that most hill schools follow is this: all work is done in the classroom and students are encouraged to play games regularly. Has The Telegraph considered giving credit to these schools which do reasonably well without resorting to private tuitions, as is the custom in the plains.

 Do cent per cent passes make for good results? Is the passing of weaker students any less important than a few students getting very high scores? The ICSE has done away with the ranking system while publishing its results, and the reasons are well known to us.

 It would be better if the The Telegraph refrained from generalizing about schools in the hills. On behalf of schools like Goethals, which has a century-old tradition of academic excellence, I vouch for the high academic standards in our institutions. 

 Yours faithfully,

M.R. Beddoe, principal, Goethals Memorial School, Darjeeling

 Sir ? The stupendous performance of students from Orissa in the CBSE exams proves beyond doubt the growing educational strength of the state. It is also heartening to note that girls have outshone the boys. This should at least be an eye-opener for parents who still grieve over the birth of girls. It should also give a boost to the state government?s ?Care for the Girl Child? scheme.

 Yours faithfully,

R. Sekar, Angul

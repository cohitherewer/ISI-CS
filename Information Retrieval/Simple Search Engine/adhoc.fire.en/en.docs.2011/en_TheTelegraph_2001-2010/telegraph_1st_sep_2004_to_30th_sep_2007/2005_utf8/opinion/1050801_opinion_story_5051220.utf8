 Letters to Editor

 Past caring

 Sir ? However well-meant, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s advice to ?Go to nursing homes? (July 25), signals an abdication of the government?s role in providing healthcare. Health is very important to the well-being and freedom of human beings, and the government ? especially one that keeps reiterating its commitment to socialism ? wants to hand it over to private hands. If it feels that it is following a Western model in this, it is being very unfair to Western nations, who have an exemplary record in public healthcare. While there is no denying that private healthcare has a place in society, it is na?ve to think that private players are here to take on the burden of public healthcare. Private players have no incentive to do this. They have invested in expensive medical equipment and their interest lies in recovering their investment at the earliest. 

 Increasingly, healthcare is becoming market-driven with diagnosis, drugs and treatment being viewed as just another commodity or service. Hoardings advertise package rates for gall-bladder removal, maternity, prostate operation, cardiac bypass, joint replacements, and so on. Broad-spectrum antibiotics sold as OTC products are today a thriving business. One wonders where all this is taking us. Bhattacharjee has said that private hospitals will offer beds at affordable rates to the needy. Is he not aware that beds constitute a fraction of the total hospitalization costs of surgery, the bulk of which is made up of surgeons? fees, cost of surgical disposables and drugs, and fees for the use of medical equipment, operation theatre and ICU. Bhattacharjee ought to turn his attention to improving the condition of public healthcare in the state. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee seems to be all for private nursing homes, but doesn?t he know that they charge steep rates for their services? The middle class should definitely not be left to their mercies. Actually, doctors and nurses in government hospitals are far more qualified and efficient, and there is also little chance to be cheated there. The government should try to encash this goodwill. It should open pay clinics for those who can pay a reasonable rate and utilize the profits from these to partly finance free medical facilities for the poor. 

 Yours faithfully,

Hara Lal Chakraborty, Calcutta

 Sir ? ?Go to nursing homes?, the ?do it now? chief minister of West Bengal, has told patients. And why not? With so many state-of-the-art private hospitals coming up in the city and state, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has to do everything he can to ensure they run at a profit. But what would happen if doctors in state-run hospitals heeded Bhattacharjee?s advise and went over to private hospitals? Lately, many reputed doctors from these hospitals have been doing so, tempted by fantastic pay packets. But these very doctors, after switching over to these hospitals for the rich, cease to rely on their clinical skills and instead, recommend diagnostic tests. Indeed, with so many cases of medical negligence coming up against doctors, no one wants to take chances with the diagnosis. To cover up, several hospitals have come up with ?free? treatment for the poor. But one can?t simply walk in and claim these facilities, patients need recommendations from house doctors, politicians and so on to get a free bed. With private hospitals coming up with travel packages for relatives of patients, healthcare is definitely turning into a hospitality industry. But does this mean that the state government will do nothing to improve conditions in state-run hospitals?

 Yours faithfully,

Sumant Poddar, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The state government is busy setting up hospitals and medical colleges besides going for partnerships with industrial houses. But why isn?t it doing anything to improve the conditions in the four big medical colleges in the city? Recently it has decided to do away with rubber gloves and bring in plastic ones. Plastic gloves are slippery to work with and more prone to get torn. Isn?t the government serious about protecting the lives of the interns and other health personnel? 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Bose, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir ? In the last two months or so, I have received perhaps ten telephone calls, all between 2.30 and 4 pm, from women who have claimed to speak from Citibank. They have generally been persistent, and I was annoyed enough to shout at two. Others, on being clearly told that I was not interested in whatever they were offering, hung up without a word of apology. It gives me no pleasure to be unpleasant to young-sounding women who are only trying to make a living and must follow the orders of their superiors. But their calls are a nuisance. 

 Yours faithfully,

Mukul Dube, New Delhi

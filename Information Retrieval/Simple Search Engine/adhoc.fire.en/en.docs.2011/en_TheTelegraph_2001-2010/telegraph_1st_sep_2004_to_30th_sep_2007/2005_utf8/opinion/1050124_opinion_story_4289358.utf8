 MORE SMOKE

 It is a record of kinds, that the true cause of the burning of one coach in a train should persist in eluding investigators. With forensic tools, post-mortem findings and eyewitness accounts, a burnt coach should be the simplest mystery to penetrate. But the truth about the burning of coach S6 of the Sabarmati Express on February 27, 2002 remains elusive. Although the interim report of the latest inquiry, commissioned by the Union railways minister, Mr Laloo Prasad Yadav, last September, says how the fire could not have started, it does not say how it did. It discards the hypothesis of inflammable liquid, either thrown from outside or within, and, with it, the presence of ?miscreants?. This new U.C. Banerjee report confirms the stone-throwing episode, and cites it as reason for the closed doors and windows. What is new? One, the report says the fire in S6 could only have been accidental. Two, it contradicts earlier police and forensic reports, by suggesting that the doors were closed. The forensic report, which had first refuted the initial police theory of petrol being thrown from outside and had said it was thrown within the compartment, had also said that three of the four doors were open. Another forensic report, as recent as the Banerjee report, has withdrawn the hypothesis about inflammable liquid, having found ?no traces? of it. Add to this the eyewitness accounts, clear in themselves, but making up no comprehensive picture, the changing chargesheets of the police, lost records and documents and the fact of hasty post-mortems by the railway track without sufficient equipment ? and the truth promises to recede forever.

 The Banerjee inquiry is supposed to focus on the issue of railway safety. Very fitting for Mr Yadav, who is being accused by the opposition of deliberately timing a motivated study to draw in minority votes in the Bihar assembly elections. Whatever be the case, the truth about Godhra, the terrible preamble to the Gujarat carnage, will constantly be obscured by a fierce fight for credibility by politicians for two distinct vote banks, the born-again Hindus on one side and minorities and believers in secularism on the other. Religion in the guise of politics is a determined obscurer of the truth ? perhaps that is why the judge, Mr U.C. Banerjee, has spent six pages of the report on the subject of secularism.

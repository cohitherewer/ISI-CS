 Letters to Editor

 Put to test

 Sir ? There is considerable debate in education circles all over India about school curricula ? their content as well as structure. There is a need to revamp the system to make it more focused, responsive and tuned to modern-day requirements. The burden of books and homework, and the compulsion to appear for exams must also be reduced. The novel ideas of books being left in the school, lessening homework and no exams up to the seventh standard are more than welcome. Such programmes for reforming the education system need to be kept free of political intervention. Private tuition should also be discouraged since it lessens the importance of classroom teaching. Tuitions also propagate a kind of compartmentalized, learning-by-rote system where a child cannot learn what he wants in a free environment.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Kamat, Alto Porvorim, Goa

 Sir ? The proposal of the National Council for Education Research and Training to make board examinations optional is not only ridiculous and one-dimensional, but shocking as well (?Class X test on stress-buster radar?, Sept 4). Board exams are like milestones in a student?s academic career. These exams not only test the thoroughness of students? knowledge in subjects but also test their strength of character. By making board exams optional, are they suggesting that Indian students lack the strength of character to handle the pressure of board examination? How does the NCERT plan to tackle the problems students will face if companies refuse to recruit them on grounds that they have not cleared any board exams? Making all assessments internal and handing over the responsibility to schools will only make matters worse as it will never be completely unbiased and rational. Instead, emphasis should be shifted from testing how much a student can memorize to testing his comprehension and understanding of the subjects. Situations of pressure makes strong individuals while making things easy often creates fragile and brittle individuals. We need strong citizens now more than ever.

 Yours faithfully,

Abhishek Dhar, Calcutta

 Sir ? The opinion of the NCERT that Class X board examinations should be made optional is quite disturbing. It is true that the stress on students is really high these days, but the idea of abolishing examinations at the end of the secondary level of education is not a wise one. Should not the students be taught to face the pressure that examinations entail instead of running away from it? Our aim should be to provide better guidance to students through proper counselling and training. 

 The second suggestion ? to set the question paper in such a way that students are able to finish writing the answers fast ? will also mean compromising with the standard of the examination. If students are not able to complete their papers and almost half of them cannot manage to pass, why not upgrade and improve the system of teaching instead of bringing down the entire examination procedure by a few notches?

 Yours faithfully,

K. Nirmala, Calcutta

 Sir ? Indian parents are known to be overprotective, now it seems Indian educationists too are no different. The most unfortunate truth of life is that, each man, employed or not, needs two square meals each day. And the days of ancestral properties being sold to maintain an extravagant lifestyle (? la Ray?s Jalsaaghar) are long over. The rich of today, the Bill Gateses and Azim Premjis, made it on their own, but may not be able to pass it on to their offspring, as the British monarchy has done over centuries.

 The primary objective of education in this changed scenario is to equip our children with necessary skills to survive in today?s fiercely competitive world. Lessening their burden and stress are noble thoughts, but these are essential components of modern life. Even if they are spared these, children will have to face them when they grow up. We cannot protect them forever. The motivation to perform, and to excel, comes with competition. Instead of exposing children suddenly to the real world, we can make the process gradual for them.

 The decision to withdraw English from the primary-level curriculum was made in West Bengal ostensibly to lessen the burden on students. The result is there for everyone to see. Let us try and learn from that experience.

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Pal, Batanagar

 Class and religion

 Sir ? When I first read the news about the staff and guardians of students of a state school opposing the romantic relationship between a Hindu and a Muslim teacher ? Moushumi Mishra and Rafiqul Mondol ? I thought the story was from somewhere in Bihar or Uttar Pradesh or even Gujarat (?Teacher in love kept out of class?, Sept 5). It shocked me when I realized that the boycott of the couple was happening in the land where we boast of Rabindranath and Nazrul Islam. It is cruelly funny that teachers and parents are asking the question, ?How can a Hindu girl marry a Muslim boy?? Or pointing out that this will set a bad example for the students. On the contrary, I think a marriage like this will strengthen the ideals of national integration and dispel the misconceptions about religion, caste, race and so on. I am sure that the secular and communist government of the state, through its education department, will take steps to ensure that religious bigots are not allowed to take Moushumi and Rafiqul away from each other.

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir ? Moushumi Mishra and Rafiqul Mondol are both educated individuals, they have the right to choose their own life partners. Neither the authorities of their schools nor the guardians of students can interfere with this decision. Nor can anyone else raise questions about this in a secular country. We should encourage the couple in every way to remain steadfast in their decision.

 Yours faithfully,

Banhishikha Majumder, Calcutta

 A TALE OF TWIN PLANETS

 Gwynne Dyer

 ?Essentially, we want to know why Venus went bad,? said David Southwood, head of science at the European Space Agency. ?Earth could easily have turned out like that. It is important that we find out why, and Venus Express should do that.?

 The ESA?s Venus Express mission blasted off from Russia?s Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan last week. When it reaches Venus in April, it will go into orbit around the planet and deploy sensors to figure out why the place is such a hell-hole.

 Earth and Venus are almost the same size, and there is not all that huge a difference in the amount of heat they get from the sun. The average temperature on the surface of our planet, at least since life appeared some 3.5 billion years ago, has always stayed between 10 and 20 degrees celsius. On Venus, it is 465 degrees celsius. That is hot enough to melt lead.

 The immediate reason for the difference is obvious: Venus?s atmosphere is 90 times thicker than Earth?s, and it is 98 per cent carbon dioxide. It is the runaway greenhouse effect produced by that deep, dense blanket of CO2 wrapped around the planet that causes the incredible surface temperatures.

 Alive and kicking

 Venus is the lost, evil twin of Earth, and it tells us what Earth would be like without life. It is living things that have taken almost all the CO2 out of the atmosphere, incorporating the carbon into their bodies or burying it in chalk and thus releasing the oxygen to create the atmosphere we have today. The current balance of the Earth?s atmosphere ? 99 per cent nitrogen and oxygen and almost no CO2 ? is highly unstable, but the activities of living things have kept it the way it is for several billion years. That, in turn, keeps the Earth cool enough for life to flourish here.

 Jim Lovelock, the British scientist who first advanced the Gaia hypothesis 35 years ago, figured out what the Earth would be like if it had a ?chemical equilibrium? atmosphere unmodified by the processes of life. Our atmosphere would be 98 per cent carbon dioxide and it would be 60 times denser than it is at present. And the average surface temperature on Earth beneath this blanket of carbon dioxide would be 290 degrees celsius. No life would exist here either.

 Promising start

 There is a certain circularity to this proposition ? a planet like ours will maintain a temperature suitable for life only if it has a lot of living things on it ? but several things may help to explain why it is nevertheless true. One is that the carbon dioxide in a planet?s atmosphere tends to accumulate, mostly from volcanic eruptions, over a long period of time, and would not have produced such an extreme greenhouse effect in the earliest history of either Venus or Earth. The other is that the heat output of the sun grows as the star ages, and has increased by about 30 per cent since life appeared on this planet. So it is possible that Venus was also cool enough to support life 3.5 billion years ago.

 Here life released the oxygen and fixed the carbon, leaving just enough carbon dioxide in the atmosphere for a mild greenhouse effect ? and presumably modified that level of CO2 as the sun heated up in order to keep the average temperature in the narrow band that is optimal for carbon-based life. Whereas if life did get started on Venus and began to transform that planet?s atmosphere as it changed the earth?s, at some point it was unable to keep up with the rapid accumulation of CO2 and fell victim to a runaway greenhouse effect.

 That is what David Southwood was talking about when he said that ?Earth could easily have turned out like that.? And though he would never say so in public, he must sometimes wonder if it still could. Venus Express won?t give us all the answers, but it?s a start.

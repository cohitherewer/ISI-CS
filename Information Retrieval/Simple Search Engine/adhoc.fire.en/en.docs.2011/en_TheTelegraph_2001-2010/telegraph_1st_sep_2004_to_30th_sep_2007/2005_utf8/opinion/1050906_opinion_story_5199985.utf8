 Letters to Editor

 Thank the rulers

 Sir ? I fully endorse Rama- chandra Guha?s views on British rule in India (?Last words on the raj?, Sept 3). Some of our so-called intellectuals and politicians are incapable of contributing anything positive towards India?s development, but would rather criticize the British to cover up their own shortcomings. How was it possible for a trading house like the East India Company to militarily defeat a giant like India and rule it for over two centuries? The reason is, India?s leaders have never had any compunctions about selling the country?s interests to outsiders. History shows that every single military victory gained by our soldiers on the battlefield has been sold to the enemy by our leaders; the last example was Shimla in 1972. We, as a nation, should be grateful to the British not only for setting up a first-rate administrative system in the country, but also because they defeated the Japanese on India?s borders in World War II. One shudders to think what would have been India?s fate had the British 14th Army lost the crucial Kohima-Imphal battle to the Japanese.

 Winston Churchill?s remark that we Indians are unfit to rule ourselves rings truer with every passing day.

 Yours faithfully,

J.K. Dutt, Calcutta

 Sir ? Ramachandra Guha seems to forget the fact that plunderers can never be saviours. Acknowledging the contributions of the British is all very well, but it is not going to change the fact that they were oppressors. At best, they can be labelled ?benevolent oppressors?. It is easy to see that the Britishers have left us incapable of seeing our own good. If we can still boast of a national consciousness holding us together, it is largely because of the perceptions formed during the pre-British times. The British way of looking at things has sounded the death knell for many of our institutions. Finally, what?s the point in praising Britishers when their systems have produced generations which are ashamed of their forefather?s actions, and fail to view them in the right perspective?

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad

 Sir ? The British raj indeed acted as a positive catalyst between modernity and Indian society. Although Ramachandra Guha is correct in saying this, he makes a few unwarranted generalizations.

 First, it is incorrect that the number of famines went down during British rule. Famines have been recorded in oral and written Indian documents ever since the Rig Veda, and around two major famines per century was the standard for 700 years before the establishment of the raj. In contrast, the number of major famines, by some estimates, increased to 36 in the 190 years since Plassey. After the 1900 famine codes were imposed, the situation improved somewhat. Even then, the example of the 1943 Bengal famine has been mentioned by the author himself. Neither is it true that the princely rulers were more callous than the British ? as early as 1681 and as late as 1896, native rulers were imposing price controls and introducing emergency government purchase of grains to prevent spiralling prices. During the raj, poorer sections of the population were entirely helpless, as hoarding resulted in spiralling prices, as markets were freed without developing adequate institutions.

 Second, to say that India before British rule was not a nation, is to go by the Western definition of a nation-state. India was more than a nation ? it was a civilization.

 Third, yes, the English did give us modernity, but it was their modernity, not ours. Who can say that India would not have undergone an industrial revolution of its own had it not been invaded and mutilated? If we study India?s manufacturing output as a percentage of global output, its share declined from 25 per cent in the 1750s to around 8 per cent a century later, during the high noon of colonialism. Free markets, entrepreneurship, trade, lucrative industries for both export and domestic consumption, and resources ? all the ingredients for an industrial revolution were there in India. Speculation this might be, but to imply that India would have been at sea without the injection of Western modernity needs to be taken with a dose of scepticism.

 Yours faithfully,

Aruni Mukherjee, Calcutta

 In a state

 Sir ? There is no doubt that the Bihar governor, Buta Singh, has frittered away a historic opportunity to provide unpoliticized and effective administration to the state. A state with no law and order, little development and growing insurgency desperately needed to be put under president?s rule. But Buta Singh has allowed the state to sink deeper into chaos. The nation will pay a heavy price for this. He must immediately be sacked. The United Progressive Alliance government is to blame for the mess that is Bihar today, and the Union home minister, Shivraj Patil, should be made to follow Buta Singh when the heads roll, if they do at all.

 Yours faithfully,

Pranav Sachdeva, New Delhi

 Sir ? Buta Singh?s report is out. It is clearly biased against the National Democratic Alliance. But isn?t the governor supposed to be equal to all? Since Singh?s dislike for the NDA is no secret, who can say that he will not try to prevent it from coming to power if it wins the Bihar assembly elections in October? 

 Yours faithfully,

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? Even if it is accepted that some Lok Janshakti Party legislators were itching for a change of jersey, does it justify Buta Singh?s dissolution of the Bihar assembly anticipating horse-trading? When switching alliances from one party to another is legally permissible, discussions, meetings and negotiations must be permissible as well. Viewed thus, it is queer logic to say that any ?move by the breakaway faction to align with any other party to cobble a majority...would positively affect the constitutional provisions...and distort the verdict of the people?. There are instances aplenty of such alignments taking place in the past with no legal impediments whatsoever.

 It is time for political parties to seriously think if discredited or infirm members should be rewarded with gubernatorial posts to serve their parties? interests.

 Yours faithfully,

P.K. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 THE VICTOR AND THE VANQUISHED

 In the man-animal conflict, triggered either by lack of space or fear of disease and famine, man wins hands down, says Sudipta Bhattacharjee

 Final dishonour

 Venison, it is said, is a gourmets 

 delight. Last Yuletide, on seeing residents of Virginia 

 in the United States of America gleefully shoot deer which 

 strayed into their wooded backyards, I had been appalled. 

 Attributing this to the free run of the Bush-favoured National 

 Rifle Association, Id bristled self-righteously that 

 such action would not go unpunished in India. After all, 

 there were court cases and protests raging over the shooting 

 of black buck (a perennial favourite of celebrities in our 

 country) to justify my stand

 Over the past few weeks, however, 

 events here have led to a revision of these views. On November 

 24, villagers poisoned two Royal Bengal tigers in the Orang 

 National Park for preying on cattle. The same day, an elephant 

 crossing the train tracks was run over near Guwahati and 

 its carcass unceremoniously hauled, legs first, by a crane. 

 According to the Wildlife Protection Society of India, poaching 

 is so rampant that even after the brouhaha over the Sariska 

 tiger reserve, no significant measures have been taken to 

 protect animals in other national parks. Madhya Pradesh, 

 Uttar Pradesh, Orissa, West Bengal, Assam and Arunachal 

 Pradesh have been identified as the most affected zones. 

 The methods of poaching are usually through poisoned bait, steel traps, electrocution or by firearms. In most cases, the animal is killed, or worse, maimed. A recent photograph in leading newspapers of a rhinoceros in Calcutta?s Alipore zoo showed an animal with its horn hacked, but given our exemplary insensitivity, there were no murmurs of protest. Similarly, when a bull lay dying on the city?s crossroads a few days ago, it was us humans who acted with bovine indifference till we could take the stench of the bloated carcass no more.

 The Tiger Task Force has found thousands of villages located in core areas of sanctuaries, while many more settlers in the buffer zones add to the woes of conservationists. The government pays Rs 1 lakh as compensation to people relocated from forest zones, but going by the dismal record, especially at Sariska, the villagers invariably return to forest homesteads even after accepting the money. Besides, most national parks in our country, including major ones like Bandhavgarh, Sariska and Ranthambhor, have places of worship inside the forest, blatantly encroaching on inviolate wildlife domain.

 In Gohpur, Assam, residents are openly planning to poison a herd of elephants that has been destroying crops and houses. They have even gone to the extent of hiring poachers to kill the tuskers. These are certainly not stray incidents. Legislators from the North-east regularly stress on the need to reduce elephant depredation (by killing the animals) to appease the electorate. That the encroachment and blocking of elephant corridors are entirely the fallout of overpopulation and faulty planning by humans is always overlooked. Ritual hunting by tribals in states like Jharkhand and Arunachal Pradesh are often deplored. Thankfully, these annual ? sports? are limited to a few days. 

 Against this backdrop, the efforts by the Assam forest department last week to sensitize villagers on the role of animals in the eco-system comes as a welcome move, albeit belated.

 When the avian flu alert was sounded, lakhs of chicken were exterminated. Migratory birds, which grace our water bodies every winter, are now tracked, monitored and decimated on the suspicion of being carriers of the H5N1 strain of influenza. And just because 68 human deaths have been reported worldwide till the end of November. The panic is unwarranted given that scientists of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research said as recently as on December 9 that there was no proof that avian flu was transmitted to human beings. Yet countries like South Africa and Zimbabwe have already culled 26,000 ostriches for testing positive for the H5N2 virus, which does not pose any threat to humans.

 The fear of flu has driven people to shun poultry and devour other animals with a vengeance. This writer?s first ?encounter? with predatory human instincts towards harmless dogs was on a crowded Shillong street. The taxi just ahead stopped and four stocky young men jumped out. They grabbed a plump street dog, tied a sack round its head and dumped the howling creature into the boot of the cab. Gradually, we stopped reacting because this was such a common sight. But recently, when a visitor from Nagaland regaled willing audiences by describing his forays into the domain of lip-smacking dog-meat delicacies, the trauma of having helplessly witnessed the smashing of canine skulls returned to haunt me.

 The slaughter is not limited to dogs. Today, farmers in Mizoram are busy chopping up rats. With bamboo flowering in profusion, rodent armies are on the march, threatening to destroy paddy fields. Rats feed on bamboo seeds, rich in enzymes like deamidase, amylase and amygdalin. According to the Forest Research Institute, Dehradun, these trigger an overdose of oestrogen, enhancing fertility of the rodents. Once the supply of bamboo flowers and seeds are depleted, the vastly multiplied rodent population attacks the paddy fields with gusto. It happened in 1959, when the Mizo Hills suffered widespread famine or mautam. In his account of the ?worst natural calamity? in the region, former bureaucrat Animesh Ray wrote: ?In 1958, bamboos flowered all over the Mizo Hills. Field rats multiplied very fast, ate up the bamboo flowers and next devoured the standing crops?. 

 The famine, which subsequently ravaged the Mizo Hills, gave birth to voluntary social welfare organizations, like the Mizo National Famine Front in 1960. The following year, the front became a political party, the Mizo National Front, which spearheaded a 20-year spell of one of the country?s bloodiest insurgencies. It is ironical that one of the senior-most insurgent leaders, Zoramthanga, now heads the same MNF as chief minister of Mizoram, a state feared to be on the threshold of another famine. 

 Given the expected nature of the 50-year bamboo flowering cycle, the Mizoram government claims it swung into a preventive drill as early as in 1998. Zoramthanga drew up a Rs 500 crore combat plan, of which the Centre granted Rs 10 crore this year. Nearly two lakh rats were exterminated. Farmers were paid a rupee for every rat tail deposited at the office of the state agriculture department. Early harvesting of bam boo (before the flowering) was advocated, so that rodent fertility could be minimized. 

 Yet all these efforts seem to have come to no avail, if distraught Mizo farmers are to be believed. Rodent ?outbreak? has been reported from Serchhip district already, with villagers claiming that the rats not only devoured paddy, they even chomped on chillies! Reports are pouring in from northern Mizoram, as well as Lunglei district. Sighting of thangnang, the bug the Mizos consider a harbinger of famine, has added to the fear. Since no scientific mechanism appears to be in place, farmers will have to bank on the tail-cutting exercise to earn a livelihood over the next few months. 

 In the man-animal conflict, the latter is hardly given an option to face an honourable exit. It may be something as innocuous as catching cows on the streets of Delhi (to clear the roads for a fee), or keeping a famine or fever at bay by killing rats and birds en masse. But don?t such exercises to ensure the survival of the fittest put Darwinian theorists to shame? Even conceding the domino effect of pandemics, surely prophylactic measures ensure better risk insulation than random eradication of a species?

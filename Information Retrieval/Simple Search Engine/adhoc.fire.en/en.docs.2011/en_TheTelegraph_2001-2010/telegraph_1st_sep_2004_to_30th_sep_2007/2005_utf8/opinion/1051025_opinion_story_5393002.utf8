 NEW MAN?S LANGUAGE

 With the advent of BPOs and call centres, Indians will find Harold Pinter easier to identify with than ever, writes Vishnupriya Sengupta

 The conversation must go on

 ?That play last night??

 ?Good, wasn?t it??

 ?It was good.?

 ?I thought it was good.?

 ?Good.?

 ?It was.?

 ?Pinter wrote it.?

 ?Yes. Harold Pinter.?

 The above dialogue on a play by this year?s Nobel laureate, Harold Pinter, which appeared as a cartoon in the New Yorker magazine, depicts a ludicrous Pinteresque exchange. The exchange serves to provide a cardinal insight into the plays themselves. Pinter?s plays are replete with such dialogue constituting arbitrary talk, superfluous repetition, clich?s and mock proverbs. Such dialogue hints at the possibility of communication being meaningless. In fact, his plays apparently frustrate expectations about the unity and coherence of a human character along with the cause and effect continuity of its development. But the reader, on his/her part, strongly resists accepting anarchy and total non-meaningfulness in a text. If the play appears to be non-meaningful, the reader tries to seek a pattern or wholeness attributing some kind of meaning to the words spoken. 

 One can well argue that most playwrights use this garb of language either to convey or conceal their thoughts, reveal that which is not, or perhaps, conceal that which is. But Pinter does this most aptly and successfully through the framework of a ?well-made play?, adhering, as it were, to the tradition of removing the fourth wall in proscenium theatre. Without ignoring the strict logic of space organization, he ably ?deconstructs? theatrical space and makes use of its constricting nature to show man?s palpable need for space both in the world within and without. This, compounded with his ability to play on words and hint at a sinister sub-text, makes Pinter so very relevant to Indians in the present times.

 For one, the dialogue in his plays could well be set in the hundreds of BPO units that have sprung up all across the country. And vice versa, the exchanges at any call centre here could provide grist for Pinter?s dramatic mill. In fact, with the outsourcing trend having caught on in a big way in India, which is one of the principal beneficiaries, and the advent of BPOs and call centres in the Orient, Pinter?s importance to an Indian audience seems to have doubled. His use of the nuances of language to convey the vacuity and meaninglessness of our mundane existence applies to this boom in the Indian job market. His intelligent use of space points to the claustrophobia that is gradually overpowering those engaged in this segment. All these factors seem to have made the task of identifying with the Nobel laureate so much more easier. In a country which has a job sector where one?s identity is constantly under threat, if not being eroded away, with Makhanlal having to rechristen himself as Mike at the workplace, conversations being conducted with a pronounced American accent, the significance of this Nobel laureate?s works cannot be underestimated.

 In any of Pinter?s plays, be it the ones such as The Birthday Party, Tea Party or Party Time which hinge on social gatherings of sorts and concentrate on social intercourse, or those such as The Homecoming or Family Voice, which revolve around the domestic fabric, or even those which focus on a universal paradigm such as Monologue or Mountain Language, one starts out by asking whether there is any verifiable relation between the word and the fact. 

 Take The Birthday Party, Pinter?s first three-act play, for instance. One of the best studies in the art of chat, the play does contain a birthday party for one of the characters, Stanley, who insists it is not his birthday. Stanley is a nincompoop who claims to have been a concert pianist once upon a time. The only lodger at a seaside guest house, he leads a vegetative life. Two visitors arrive unexpectedly. The intruders turn Stanley into a ?new man?. He is reborn at their hands and made into a different kind of a person on a birthday that eventually becomes a birth-day. 

 The incident could well be symptomatic of the change that defines one section of the young, urban professionals in India. As though the preponderance of the MTV and fTV culture were not enough, the ?intruders? from the West have also ensured by way of outsourcing that there is a new birth for every fourth person lured by lucre. The personnel employed at the call-centres are meant to ensure the smooth functioning of shopping malls in the West or help out with the management of funds and accounts of people situated across the seven seas. 

 The method employed is language and the caller is compelled to acquire the requisite information from the personnel through allusions, digressions, sentence fragments and seeming inconsequentialities. But then every utterance counts, everything said is significant and carries the action towards the intended effect. Just as Pinter in his plays is seen to combine both ?phatic? signals ? serving largely to establish or maintain contact, keep the conversation going, provide feedback to the speaker ? and ?conative? signals ? which focus on the direct expression of the speaker?s attitude to what he is speaking about and the observable effect this has on the addressee. 

 In other words, the contrived nature of the language of Pinter?s plays is reflective of that used in any BPO unit in the country. On a larger canvas, it shows the eventual collapse of the boundaries of the world and the stage, with the stage becoming the world, and all characters endlessly strutting in parts they have created for themselves.

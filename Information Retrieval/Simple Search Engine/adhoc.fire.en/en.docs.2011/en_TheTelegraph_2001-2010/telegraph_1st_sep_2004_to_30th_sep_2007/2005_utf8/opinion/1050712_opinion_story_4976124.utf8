 LEADERS WHO FAILED US

 MALVIKA SINGH

 Dignified maturity marked the terror attack on London, a week after we witnessed the undignified, absurd response of the BJP to the assault on the disputed precincts of the erstwhile Babri Masjid in Ayodhya. Our opposition leaders, ranging from Advani and Jaswant Singh to all those in the fanatic Hindu parivar, put us Indians to shame. They managed to antagonize a majority of their traditional supporters who are beginning to see through the reactionary rhetoric, albeit reluctantly. Delhi abounds with comments that discredit the integrity and purpose of the BJP and its greater family, particularly after a television channel reported that the ?terrorists? had prayed at a temple before entering the premises of the cordoned-off site. Many citizens were ashamed by national leaders behaving like irresponsible political juveniles. Some even questioned their nationalism!

 These failed leaders, busy trying to make political capital and earn selfish brownie points, forgot to hail the heroic defenders of the law. The swift action of the authorities was remarkable. The assault on the ?site? had no impact of any consequence...life carried on across India and calm prevailed, amongst Hindus, at other religious places and sites, shattered only by the shrill voices of BJP leaders, trying to incite fellow Hindus to react and take to the streets. But thankfully their call was ignored. Only the fringe rabble-rousers broke rules, walked onto the tarmac, gheraoed an airplane and indulged in sick-making acts. National leaders of the parivar looked on and refused to damn the unruly.

 In sharp contrast, the citizens of London as well as Labour and Conservative politicians alike acted like responsible leaders...with appropriate dignity and unity. Not one discordant voice, not one politician trying to fault an opponent or the administration, all committed to calming the strained nerves of their fellow citizens. It was an example of democratic maturity and human solidarity. We have much to learn about appropriate behaviour. 

 Happy to be elitist

 When Indian leaders talk about ?global warming? it is a trifle scary because the environment per se is being ruthlessly destroyed, and unless there is a unilateral ban on all tampering that is constantly condoned by politicians for votes, India will be starved for water, will be a hotbed of new and strange diseases, will have created and nurtured, through the absence of the enforcement of existing laws, the desertification of this ancient and special subcontinent. Those of us who question the rampant destruction of habitats in our country are damned and branded ?elitist? by the so-called ?do gooders?, who aspire to buy fancy properties in the metropolitan cities, where they settle and spout pseudo-left punchlines. Alas, it is politically ?incorrect? to say all this but here goes ? there is no reason to feel ashamed about being the intellectual ?elite?; the stale ?rich vs poor? argument only deepens the divide and does nothing to define the possible correctives required; most nongovernmental organizationwallahs have an adequate and continuous source of funding in spite of which there is much left to be done on the ground. It is time to overhaul the paradigm and discard the jargon. 

 Where is the new thinking on these issues? Where are the fresh methodologies? Task forces are formed, led by people who are clueless about the task at hand. The pompous rhetoric that non-specialists indulge in is something to hide behind. When the cover is lifted, when incompetence is exposed, when people outside of the government-backed closed door coteries enter the fray and question acts and decisions, the ?do-gooders?, threatened by the questioning, unite, and all else becomes ?elitist?. The insecurity they exude is truly sad and reflects the dilution of serious thinking and debate in India.

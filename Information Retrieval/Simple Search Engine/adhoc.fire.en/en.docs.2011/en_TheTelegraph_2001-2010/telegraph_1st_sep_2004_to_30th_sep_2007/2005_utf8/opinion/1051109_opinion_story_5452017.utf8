 PROPERTY DISPUTE

 It is one thing to question the validity of an economic policy and quite another to use such debates for narrow political gains. Not all politicians who oppose Mr Arjun Munda?s attempts to industrialize Jharkhand have the state?s welfare in mind. But Mr Shailendra Mahto, former member of parliament from Jharkhand, has raised some valid questions. His campaign against the state government?s plans to allocate large tracts of land for new industries is also politically significant because both the chief minister and Mr Mahto belong to the Bharatiya Janata Party. Mr Mahto is right when he argues that the government should have a scheme for the rehabilitation of the poor people who would be displaced from their land by the new industries. It would be morally and politically wrong of Mr Munda to even try to acquire land from the people without offering them a rehabilitation package. Governments? rehabilitation schemes are usually sabotaged by corrupt and inept officials. But it must be a particularly insensitive government that thinks nothing of the people who would be alienated from their land because of development projects. Mr Mahto?s other argument is not as tenable. Less developed areas in Jharkhand need new industries, but it is for the investors, and not the government, to decide which locations make the best business sense. 

 However, a much bigger issue could be Mr Munda?s toughest challenge. Successive Union governments enacted laws that make it extremely difficult for the states to set up industries at the cost of forests and tribals? land. Jharkhand faces two specific problems from such laws. Nearly thirty per cent of its area is covered with forests. And it has a tribal-majority population. At the same time, most of its mineral deposits that are attracting investors are located in forest-covered land. Add to these the state?s failure to put in place even a semblance of a land-records system. All these could lead to endless legal disputes over land acquisition and future plans to rehabilitate the displaced people. Such complications could also be exploited by political trouble-makers. Worse still, they could undermine the investors? confidence. Mr Munda should waste no more time in sorting out the legal issues on the acquisition of forest land. And his government must show more sensitivity to the people?s concerns.

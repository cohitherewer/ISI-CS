 TASTE OF DHAKA

 By all indications, Saarc countries do not seem to have taken Manmohan Singh?s railing against ?failed states? seriously, writes Jyoti Malhotra

 Speaking his mind

 It was the evening before the 

 foreign ministers of the South-Asian Association for Regional 

 Cooperation countries began their debate on whether to admit 

 Afghanistan as a full-fledged member (Kabul ultimately got 

 in), and whether to give China ?observer status? in the 

 association (seems like Beijing has to cool its heels for 

 a little while longer). I had cruised into Dhaka and was 

 faced with a barrage of questions from the Bangladeshi intellectual 

 and political class about K. Natwar Singh being stripped 

 of his foriegn minister?s portfolio. With Runa Laila in 

 the backdrop, persuading the glitterati to sing ?Allah 

 megh de?, I found myself praising India?s republican 

 sentiment. No minister, I said, could expect to be above 

 board.

 In any case, I went on. Like Caesar?s wife, Natwar Singh had to be seen as honest, and not simply as the latter-day avatar of Dhritarashtra, whose blind love for his sons led to his undoing. I went on to quote Bangladesh?s classiest newspaper, The Daily Star, which, in an editorial only a couple of days ago, had waxed eloquent on democracy?s compact in India, wherein the leadership and the led had agreed that the matter was worthy of a thorough investigation.

 By the time I left that green and golden country four days later, it was with a sense of embarrassment at the baldly aggressive agenda unveiled by none other than the Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh, as he described Saarc as a bunch of ?failed states? impacting upon the virginal Indian landscape.

 What a mess it was, with Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Nepali journalists openly laughing at the prime minister?s unfortunate turn of phrase. ?India calling ?us? failed states?? they crowed, ?when it deals with about 12 insurgencies at the same time?? (As if to prove them right, the Jehanabad massacre took place less than 24 hours after the prime minister?s arrival home.) Anyone who?s heard the mirth of the underdog mocking the strongman knows it?s far worse than the muscle-flexing on the killing fields.

 So should Manmohan Singh have known better than to make such a statement? Some say the statement was hardly new, that the same words had been used by the prime minister in Chandigarh about a fortnight before, at the anniversary of the redoubtable Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses in Delhi. Others point, logically enough, to successive events ? the coup in Pakistan in 1999 and the absence of free and fair elections since then, the emergency in Nepal since February, the coordinated bomb blasts in Bangladesh to which no one has any real answers, dictatorship in the Maldives for the last 26 years, a jumpy peace process in Sri Lanka. Only Bhutan seems to have managed to deliver. In any case, if the CIA had once named Pakistan as a ?failed state?, why should India be shy of holding back the truth in the name of bleeding heart liberalism? 

 This, then is Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, also the foreign minister, in his new incarnation. At the Saarc summit the day after, the prime minister returned to his other, more comfortable, role of using economics to bridge politically explosive situations. Manmohan Singh reiterated that restoring road and air links and waterways that existed at the time of Partition, was the need of the hour. He did not add that it was time to change the thick pencil lines Cyril Radcliffe had once doodled on paper, in order to summarily divide the naturally contiguous geographies and common histories of the subcontinent, in favour of a modernized 21st century economic union. But that?s what he clearly meant.

 The Saarc summit speech seemed true to character ? stirring hope, trying to change destinies. Manmohan Singh had once crossed the same shadow lines of a partitioned sub-continent in order to find succour and refuge in scholarship and education that had, in turn, given him the opportunity to effect change. But what about the challenge of ?failed states?? How does this newly resurgent aggressive agenda square with the prime minister?s traditionally conciliatory worldview? Especially, when Nepal?s King Gyanendra had, during his own Saarc speech, used his Sandhurst accent to terrible effect by mockingly pointing a metaphorical finger at New Delhi?s dire warnings. Our neighbours, he said, were warning us of the possibility of ?failed states? when Nepal was battling the menace of Maoist terrorism.

 To be sure, the king?s speech had been typed and printed in Kathmandu before Manmohan Singh made his own IDSA statement, and he couldn?t have known what the Indian prime minister had been contemplating. But there it was, the king and the prime minister, using the same words. It certainly boggled the mind at Dhaka.

 The only thing to do was drown the depression by shopping for the gorgeous Dhakai-Jamdaani with a vengeance. In any case, few people were listening with any seriousness to the economist-turned-prime minister. Certainly not the subcontinent?s other economist-turned-prime minister, Shaukat Aziz of Pakistan, who spoke of a ?trust deficit? between India and Pakistan with the aplomb of one who?d seen signs of a definitely degenerating relationship. (Manmohan Singh?s only Saarc spark was when he admitted that such a ?trust deficit? existed and that both sides needed to do things to counter it.)

 The mind of the Nepalese king, who listened with one ear to a roadmap towards democracy and said ?fine?, must have been elsewhere. The same goes for the Bangladesh prime minister, Begum Khaleda Zia, who is said to have heard out Manmohan Singh on the need to jointly combat insurgents and terrorism, and shrugged her shoulders. As proof, I have a suitcase full of saris at home. And memories of the softest Roopchanda fish, alias pomfret, saut?ed and simmered and suffused with the tastiest mustard gravy in the world.

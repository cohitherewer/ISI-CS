 Letters to Editor

 Invention is no cure

 Sir ? Even before we deal with the menace of camera-phones, we have to grapple with its ancestor ? the good old mobile phone (?Minister on mobile, house on hold?, Dec 29). The core of human action when it comes to mobiles, as with all other scientific inventions, is the same ? irresponsibility leading to misuse. Look at the way we turned the blessing of nuclear energy into a curse. Now we are busy turning the IT revolution into another demon. And those leading the way are people like Nisith Adhikary, who violate the norms they set for others to follow. 

 Yours faithfully,

M. Chatterjee, Calcutta

 Sick industry

 Sir ? The report, ?Doctor quit jolt on health reform? (Dec 12), gives enough indication that the three doctors in the city hospitals did not resign due to ?personal reasons? but because they could no longer put up with the ?mismanagement? of the state-run hospitals and the government?s ?apathy? towards basic medical requirements. There is no denying that the government, in power for the past three decades, has failed to provide minimum healthcare. Medical negligence is apparent even in private clinics across the state. But why did Kalyan Bhattacharya, who says he has sacrificed his entire life to patient care, realize the state of affairs only after 28 long years in government service? Government hospitals in West Bengal have been in this condition for decades. Senior doctors have often left government service to set up their own private practice. Could such an intention have motivated the three doctors? resignation?

 Yours faithfully,

Kunal Saha, Ohio, US 

 Sir ? Three senior doctors of the state?s government hospitals have resigned to make a statement against the poor healthcare services. The government authorities, may be even the chief minister himself, should have met with these doctors and refused to accept their resignation if they were not satisfied with the reasons cited. That, however, is unlikely to be the case. The government will try its best to cover up its wrongdoings. As for the doctors, they should be more forthcoming in their charges against mismanagement and corruption instead of trying to guard their own flanks. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shiv Shanker Almal, Calcutta

 Sir ? Resignations are not the answer to mismanagement in government hospitals. All they could do is strengthen the hands of the corrupt.

 Yours faithfully,

Monimoy Dutta, Calcutta

 Bitter taste

 Sir ? Quality control in sweetmeat production needs a cohesive policy from the government. West Bengal accounts for a large percentage of the Indian market and should therefore lead the way. It is heartening to note that many shops have shifted to environment-friendly and hygienic packaging, but more needs to be done. Though there has been a clampdown on adulteration of food, the drive needs to be sustained. 

Yours faithfully, 

Krishnakanta Sen, Calcutta 

 Sir ? During experiments conducted in the school physics laboratory, we found out that one of the most popular brands of milk in the country had a high level of impurity. A double-toned pack of the company was only 87.5 per cent pure. If we cannot trust a government-sponsored cooperative, what can we expect from the local milkman?

Yours faithfully, 

Sweta Burman, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Why blame the cola giants when we cannot ensure that the vegetables and other edibles are pesticide-free?

 Yours faithfully,

Ritwik Bose, Calcutta

 NEW ACCESS

 The symbolic force of laws may sometimes be more meaningful than their presence. The Right to Information Act is now in force, and that makes India a proud member of an exclusive group of 55 countries that have such a law. The troubled history of the law?s evolution would point to a greater symbolic impact. The ubiquitous ?common? man?s identity, status and level of empowerment are subject to the perception of his ?rulers?. Hence, ideas about how much he should be allowed to ?know? about the forces that shape his political, economic and social existence change according to the principles on which his government is run. Necessary secrecy was consistent with colonial notions of the ruled citizen, and the persisting presence of the Official Secrets Act, 1923 indicated that successive governments in democratic India found the absence of transparency and accountability rather convenient. The Freedom of Information Act, 2002 marked at long last some success for the campaigners for the democratic right to information. But there was still some way to go, apparently. It is only in October 2005 that the promises of access to information about actions by public institutions and officials have been made good, on paper at least. In other words, symbolically, the Indian citizen is being perceived as empowered by democracy to be able to bring standards of transparency and accountability to the various forms of governance that have an intimate connection with his everyday existence.

 The legislation elucidates exactly how the right to know is to be exercised by any citizen looking for information, what the procedures should be, how frivolous requests for information would be discouraged and what he could do should the information not be given him in the time stipulated. Reasons of security would render intelligence agencies and security agencies partially exempt from the purview of queries, but all activity relating to public institutions or agencies engaged in public work with public funds would be open to scrutiny on demand. The establishment of the information commission and the appointing of information officers at every level of governance should, ideally, smooth the flow of information. The right to know is ready to be exercised; it is now the duty of the citizen to use that right. He can participate in the fight against corruption and energize governance by using it.

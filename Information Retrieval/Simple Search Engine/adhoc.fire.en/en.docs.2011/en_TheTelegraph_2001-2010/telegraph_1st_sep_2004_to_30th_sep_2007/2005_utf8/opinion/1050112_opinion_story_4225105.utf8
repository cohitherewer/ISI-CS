 FOR THAT SWEET FEELING OF HOME

 SWAPAN SETH

 There are cities that ruffle your hair when you land in them. Cities that put their arms around your shoulder and welcome you in. There are very few cities that will still ask a 37-year-old man, ?Kaise ho baba?? 

 I was born in Calcutta. It is a city that has watched me grow. And then watched me go. The truth of the matter is I never left Calcutta. I just picked up my tired body and took it to Mumbai and then to Delhi. My heart always remained in Calcutta. They say the true measure of a man is not his wealth. But indeed the richness of his relationships. Friends are the ultimate fortune. I was overwhelmed by the ever gracious Ghoshs: Gaurav and Kiran Uttam Ghosh. Each and every night that I spent in Calcutta was in their charming company at their hospitable house. 

 Each evening they pandered to my curious needs: be it rolls from the divided Nizam workforce or chicken tarka from the cathedral of cuisine: the Azad Hind Dhaba. Every evening, we were regaled by delicious dips and wicked mud pies. Even Priya Chowdhuri, purveyor of all things posh, stooped and did a rajma chawal night at my insistence.

 It is the effort that Calcutta people put in that humbles you. The graciousness that brings a lump to the throat. Every morning friends called to ask if we were taken care of. They don?t do that in very many parts of the world. 

 Lap of comfort

 I bumped into people I had not seen for decades. People I had sparred with on debating floors some 20 years ago. People whom I had done plays with. People whom time and talent had scattered far and wide.

 On New Year?s Eve, we decided to give the bashes a skip. We all collected. Friends came with their friends.The music was distinctively Eighties. It was as if one was in a time machine. I looked around at everyone in the room and then it dawned upon me that I had first heard these numbers with the very same men and women.

 How strange that was. Yet, how sublime. Where else will you get marzipan Santas like you do in the spanking new Flury?s? Where is it possible to get the kind of dal-chillars you get outside Dimple Court on Theatre Road? Or the hing kachories at Nu Variety, a little jewel-in-the-wall, close to Minto Park. Who can do a brain masala the way Kwality?s does it? Calcutta has the finest food in the country. I spent two hungry years in Mumbai, so I should know. Speaking of the finest food, we had another delightful culinary voyage to Santiniketan. 

 Escape to bliss

 There is a certain bhadrata when you get aboard the Santiniketan Express. We were guests of Anindya Mitra and his fine family at their picturesque home in Santiniketan. Each meal was a feast. Each drink, divine. Goose liver pat? with truffles lined up along side maurala maach. Afternoons were tributes to fine drinks: Singapore Slings and Sidecars. Evenings were entertainment of a special kind. We were privileged to hear the fascinating Mohan Singh delight us with pristine Rabindrasangeet. To have him in your living room is nothing short of a blessing from god.

 On another evening, a bunch of bauls held us spellbound. In an adjacent room, a battery of lawyers was thrashing out an important draft. The worst thing about a trip to Calcutta is that it ends just the moment you begin to feel completely comfortable in the chaos. And then, just when you are about to hail a cab for the airport, you have a beggar look at you and tell you ?Arey baba, bahut din baad.? That?s when there?s a flash in the eye. And you realize that you aren?t headed home. You are leaving home.

 STUCK IN THE MIDDLE

 MALVIKA SINGH

 Uma Bharti has now openly asserted her strength and is making a concerted bid to get back into the gaddi. She is a gutsy woman who acts upon her whim, whether the act is juvenile or not. Her actions are instinctive and arbitrary, which categorize her as an immature and unseasoned ?politician?. Some believe her charisma and childlike quality win her votes as she sweeps from meeting to meeting in her inimitable manner. Whether this maverick character will be able to muster success at the polls next time round is debatable. Despite the confusion, strains and factionalism within the Madhya Pradesh BJP, the rival Congress seems nowhere in the picture. Here is a god-given opportunity for it to regroup and revitalize itself, but, as usual, it is invisible. The Congress looks as if it has deactivated itself and its leadership hangs about in Delhi. Why Congress leaders have an anathema for the countryside, heaven alone knows. Their politics, too, leaves much to be desired.

 This is the time to right all the wrongs in Madhya Pradesh. Congress presence should be felt across the state and a revival should be in the air. A positive intervention to win should be the mandate but it just is not. This seems to be the case everywhere: Rajasthan, Karnataka, West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, it goes on and on. The excuse for not building from the grassroots is that coalition politics is the call of the hour, therefore the hell with the party base. If this becomes a habit, the grand old party will be reduced to a bits-and-pieces party since it has no regional base like the rest. The Congress is on the verge of handing the national party status to a fractured, dissension ridden BJP ? what irony.

 Decline and fall

 With the many young Congress members elected to parliament last time, one had hoped there would be an injection of new, energetic idealism to represent the generation that dominates the Indian landscape today. But that was not to be. The more their inclusion is delayed, the quicker will come their frustration with their party and with the realities of Bharat. When in their 30s and 40s, people have strong beliefs and positions, and therefore much to contribute. They have the energy to work towards their goals and deliver the goods. Once politicians cross their 50s they are looking for ?security?, having mastered the art of explanations and excuses, of passing the buck. This age group is, more often than not, frustrated and opposed to change and assertive action. Why does the Congress have this death wish? Is its middle-aged, middle-level leadership sabotaging the younger lot? Do the ancients in the party play similar games with the generation below them?

 Where is the sparkle and vigour in Indian politics? Why has it become so humdrum, so crass and predictable? Why are politicians seen to be unsavoury characters who defy norms of decency? This was not the reality in the first decade of freedom. What has degenerated so fundamentally? Indians want to be proud of their leaders. Unfortunately, ordinary citizens find it tough to identify with their leaders. There is nothing ?right? to emulate. Every value that Indians were brought up with has been negated by those who people the political space, compelling others to participate in ?wrongs?, which has damaged a country that was special in its worship of truth and peace.

 Since 1947, we have allowed the dilution of our ethos. As a people we have not demanded any accountability nor have we protested against the corruption of our polity. We have been complacent and silently endorsed the ?wrongs? inflicted upon us. We have nurtured a new generation in a diseased environment. We have exposed them to the worst in social disorder. We have failed them. Maybe they will resurrect correct thought and action.

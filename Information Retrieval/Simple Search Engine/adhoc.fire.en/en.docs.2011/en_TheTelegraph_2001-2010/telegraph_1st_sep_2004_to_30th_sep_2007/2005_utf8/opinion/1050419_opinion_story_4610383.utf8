 ATTACK FROM THE LARGER FAMILY

 Malvika Singh

 What the Congress-led coalition consciously decided not to do, lest they appear to be vindictive, the RSS has done rather emphatically. Atal Bihari Vajpayee has been attacked, along with his son-in-law Ranjan Bhattacharjee, through a series of damaging innuendoes. This smacks of a breakdown in the sangh parivar when confronting its political arm, the BJP, and may well be the first step towards forcing a return to the original parivar agenda. All the NDA partners have remained silent, wondering perhaps if they should venture into this family squabble. Even some within the BJP like Jaswant Singh appear to be mute spectators. Vajpayee too is being tarnished, this time by those within his greater party. Such accusations tend to stick, particularly when juxtaposed with a squeaky clean Manmohan Singh whom the BJP is assaulting relentlessly.

 Picture of a niece

 That was one vignette in the unfolding theatre of the absurd. Then came the amazing saga of Najma Heptullah, former deputy chairman of the Rajya Sabha, who recently swore her allegiance to the BJP because she felt Sonia Gandhi had slighted her, where she allegedly doctored a photograph of herself with Maulana Azad. Why did she need to do so if her claim of ?niecehood? is true? This kind of action defines a complete erosion of morality. Her alleged action is dishonest and totally unnecessary. Those in parliament and leading the discourse there should be the custodians of morality in its broadest definition. They must gracefully step down and move when caught in acts of impropriety.

 Another absurd clip on the board this week: secretary, environment busy trying a PR trick under orders from a former secretary environment, now sitting within the portals of central power. The claim is that disgruntled environmental scientists are overreacting to the poaching of tigers and that things are not as disastrous as they seem. Sir, the Indian public will not believe the untruths that are being spread by a ministry running for cover. Everyday the unravelling situation exposes more corruption and administrative ineptitude. It is over for tigers and the present incumbents will have to carry the guilt to their graves. The last flutter of their candle will soon die. 

 Fossil pageant

 Then there was the amusing enactment of the passing of the old guard of the CPI(M). A popular English channel showed Comrade Surjeet moving off the dais, filmed in slow motion, being replaced by a sixty-plus Prakash Karat, a generational change. Ouch? those passing on and the ones taking over are all old compared to the majority of Indians, over sixty per cent, who will vote next time. Stalin had been resurrected and was back on the stage, billboards felicitated the ?living legends?, Surjeet and Basu, much like ads honouring Kishori Amonkar and Pandit Jasraj ? only, the background colour was red.

 And there was jubilation that the most ?progressive? party had managed to get a woman politburo member. Eureka. As one newspaper put it, comrade at work, comrade at home, comrade in arms ? Brinda Karat. The Karat family, through dint of hard work, is finally at the helm of power leading the CPI(M) into the new millennium.

 One vignette in this grand theatre that was missing was the same old sermon, chapter and verse, that has been diligently repeated, day in and day out, by A.B. Bardhan. It was such a relief not to have to see or hear him go on and on, hectoring the government when his party never managed to deliver anything of consequence. Why the CPI has petrified into a fossil continues to puzzle me.

 Yes, they are all the same in the end.

 Letters to Editor

 Of life and death

 Sir ? Now that the apex court has ruled that ?Life sentence for life: SC? (Sept 17), state governments should not be allowed to grant any reprieve to lifers. What worries is that there are several who have been released prematurely. But should lifers be set free at all? Who gets a life sentence? Those who commit heinous crimes. Those who kill in cold blood. Are they human beings? No. Should they be allowed back into society? No. For they not only destroy lives, but also dreams and hopes of those who live. They must get what they deserve.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sk. Samim, Howrah

 Self-service

 Sir ? Times have changed. Gone are the days when only Brahmins were authorized by the Vedas to chant mantras. Lead was poured into the ears of the shudras who heard the chants, even by mistake. But to enjoy that monopoly, Brahmins had to follow a rigorous lifestyle. How many Brahmins abide by the guidelines set by the Vedas today? Moreover, even among brahmins, there are hardly any who are interested in taking up the profession of priests or purohits. As a result, there is now an acute shortage of dedicated and sincere priests. Women can jolly well fill that lacuna (?Woman as idol, not priest?, Sept 15). Yet our shortsightedness prevents people like Purnima Ghosh being accepted as priests. But Ghosh and several committed individuals like her, who have been accepted, trained and authorized to serve as priests by the Maniktola tol, would have made such a difference to our religious festivals. But while we worship women as goddesses, we refuse to have them perform the rituals associated with it. Bengalis are supposed to be progressive. Why can?t they drop their gender bias? 

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

 Sir ? ?Woman as idol, not priest? talks about the Hindu society?s hypocrisy. But it is not usual to find women priests in any religion. The only problem is that while Hindus worship women as shakti, they refuse to have them perform the puja. However, the insistence on the priest being a man and a Brahmin can largely be attributed to the society?s ignorance and bigotry. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir ? The bar on women turning priests is a glaring illustration of the glass ceiling that still stands in the way of Indian women every time they venture into a male-dominated profession. Considering that women like Gargi, Maitreyi and Apala used to study the Vedas and conduct rituals, the argument that the scriptures forbid women to perform worship is untenable. Men debar women from entering this profession purely because they do not want women to invade their space. But it is time women elbowed in. This would create an environment for healthy competition and increase the urge for accurate performance of rituals. May be, then we would not have to tolerate purohits who can barely articulate hymns.

 Yours faithfully,

Sharmistha Dhar, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is alright when local dadas argue that women cannot perform the pujas they fleece people for (How can they cut short rituals and spend on pandals then?). But when erudite scholars like Sukumari Bhattacharya also agree that ?practically it is impossible?, instead of trying to convince people otherwise, things become difficult. She even goes on to say that women need ?vast knowledge of the Vedas and years of experience? to become purohits. Does she think the purohits who perform pujas today (and get regularly hijacked on Saraswati and Lakshmi puja days) have any of that?

 Yours faithfully,

J. Acharya, Calcutta

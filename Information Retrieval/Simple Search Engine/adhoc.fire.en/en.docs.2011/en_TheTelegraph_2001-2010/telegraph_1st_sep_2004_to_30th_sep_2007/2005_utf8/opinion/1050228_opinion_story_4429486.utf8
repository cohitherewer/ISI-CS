 TWIN ROADS

 There was a catchy motto hidden in the pre-budget address of the president, Mr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, to a joint session of parliament on Friday last. ?Efficiency and equity??, which the president described as the ? twin roads? on which the United Progressive Alliance government plans to move forward, make up a phrase that not only sounds good, but could also seem to be a reachable goal. It suggests balance, the magic poise that Mr Manmohan Singh?s government must strive to attain if it is to free itself of the bogey of the National Democratic Alliance?s ill-fated confidence in a shining India. The president?s speech was couched in the rhetoric of reconciliation between reform policies and the good of the common man. While the speech did not flinch from listing all the sectors which were clearly the focus of reform, it was carefully modulated to keep at the forefront the needs of the poor, especially those in rural areas. So, while the president mentioned plans to accelerate public and private investment in agriculture, education, employment, healthcare, infrastructure, urban renewal and water, he promised a counterweight in the form of a new deal to rural India that would be presented in the budget.

 The left is pleased. The president?s speech showed enough sensitiveness to the problems of the ?people? and adequate responsiveness to the left?s demand for increased allocations for the social sector for it to be grouse-free for the moment. The UPA?s ?aam aadmi? or common man is evidently identical to the left?s ?people?. One of the achievements of the president?s speech, a foretaste of the Central government?s approach, has been the satisfied murmur from the left. But it is not clear from the left?s appreciation of the government?s concern for the ?social sector, infrastructure and agriculture? whether the hideously poor and homeless in the cities are also included in its definition of ?people?. The left has ruled in West Bengal for 28 years. Some people, usually from tribal belts, are managing to die because they do not get anything to eat. Perhaps the left in West Bengal might ask itself exactly how it is going to use the reform and modernization of agriculture in the promised new deal to help these ?people?. The president?s speech opens up a number of possibilities, but the left, busy in its declared ?watchdog? role, might end up with a chicken-and-egg problem.

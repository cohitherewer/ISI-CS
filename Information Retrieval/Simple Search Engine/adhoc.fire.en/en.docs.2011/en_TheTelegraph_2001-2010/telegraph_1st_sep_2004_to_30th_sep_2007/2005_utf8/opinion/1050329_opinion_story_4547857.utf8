 A PARTITION LESS PAINFUL THAN MOST OTHERS

 This Above All 

Khushwant Singh

 Nehru with Mountbatten at a Partition meeting

 Three years before the Partition of India, Reginald Coupland, who had prepared a report on the partition of Palestine to create Israel, was asked to do a similar report on the possible division of India to create Pakistan. Though he was against the British quitting India at that point of time, he forecast what the consequences would be. His forecast was much closer to what actually transpired than those made by Pandit Nehru or M.A. Jinnah. 

 Coupland was of the opinion that the division of the country would create a comparatively weak Muslim state, and do greater harm to Indian Muslims than to Hindus. India?s leaders would see no benefit in being generous to the new Muslim country. The Muslims who stayed on (or were left behind) in India could become hostages, in the literal sense of the world. 

 Jinnah, on the other hand, believed that an independent Muslim homeland in the Indian subcontinent would bring lasting peace in the region. The volatile North Western Frontier would lose all importance once a Muslim state was established in the north-west. Frontier tribesmen would lose religious and political vigour for jihad against non-Muslims. Muslims minorities in India, and Hindu and Sikh minorities in Pakistan, could be hostages of peace within each country. 

 Nehru?s forecast was much the same as Jinnah?s. He believed with Muslims getting what they wanted, communal strifes would come to an end. Because of their miscalculations, over a million innocent Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs lost their lives, over 15 million lost their homes and properties and there have been more Hindu-Muslim clashes since independence than ever before.

 Nevertheless, writes Radha Kumar, in her new book, Making Peace with Partition, the partitioning of India was less painful than that in other countries like Ireland, Yugoslavia, Cyprus, Palestine and Korea. In these fierce hatred between communities continues, while between India and Pakistan, despite the three wars they fought, there is as much love between the people as there is hatred. 

 Kumar gives three reasons for this odd phenomenon. One that while the other partitions followed ethnic strife, the division of India came after the Congress, representing a predominantly Hindu India, and the Muslim League, representing the Muslim majority, and both committed to democratic ideals, agreed to separate before the actual separation took place. Second, in both countries the armed forces remained strictly neutral and, in fact, did their best to contain civilian violence. Finally, while other nations had to divide cities (like Berlin and Jerusalem) no cities in India or Pakistan met the same fate. Though I remain unconvinced by Kumar?s analysis, it gave me much food for re-thinking on the subject.

 Kumar?s book takes little more than two hours to read, but it is very readable: it is a refreshingly new look at India-Pakistan relations from their inception to the present times. It is accurate, unbiased and lucid.

 Home is where the heart is

 Munir Kadri and his wife Chandra have made their home in Rotorua (New Zealand), famous for its large spread of hot water sulphur springs. He comes from a prosperous Muslim family of Ahmedabad. In his wallet he always carries a small photograph of his palatial ten-bedroom family home with an inset of his father, a princely-looking young man, wearing a Rajasthani style turban. 

 Chandra is a Chaurasia brahmin from Meerut. The two met while studying in England. Munir Kadri was specializing in urinary diseases, she studying gynaecology.

 Before he left for further studies in medicine, Munir was involved in the Civil Disobedience movement and had been jailed. His family members were ardent nationalists. Munir?s brother also has a Hindu wife and is today one of the leading architects of Mumbai.

 When Munir and Chandra decided to get married, Chandra?s father was literally up in arms. He took his revolver and his wife with him and flew to Europe. They summoned Munir and Chandra to meet them in Frankfurt. Before doing so, Munir and Chandra got married in a registry office. When Chandra?s father pulled out his gun, Chandra calmly told him, ?If you kill him, you will be making your own daughter a widow.? He did not pull the trigger. Her mother was more compromising. She asked them to go through the rituals of a Hindu marriage. They readily agreed to do so.

 Munir qualified as a urologist. Then the two proceeded to UCLA In Los Angeles, where urology was more advanced. He did not get permission to stay on in the US as he had been let in on a student visa. His American professor fixed a job for him in Rotorua. And there they have been living for the last 35 years with their two children.

 The Kadris make it a point to spend three winter months in the Indian subcontinent. Since he has specialized in urology, Munir performs prostate gland surgery free of charge wherever he goes. His other passion is Urdu poetry. He makes it a point to attend mushairas in Pakistan and India. He arranges his visits to Delhi to be able to attend Jashn-e-Bahaaraan, Indo-Pak mushaira organized by Kamana Prasad.

 There was a dramatic episode in the Kadri saga. When Chandra?s father was taken seriously ill, Munir went to Meerut to attend to him. His last words to Munir were a reluctant admission: ?If I were to use a torch to look for a son-in-law for my daughter, I would not have found a better man than you.?

 Shame on us

 It is somewhat odd that while millions of Bangladeshis have illicitly infiltrated into India, been given ration cards and the right to vote, a distinguished Bangladeshi novelist, who has won a prestigious Indian literary award and has asked for Indian citizenship, has not yet been given it. Taslima Nasreen has a fatwa pronounced against her and is threatened with murder if she returns to the land of her birth. At no time did she malign Islam or write anything about Prophet Mohammed. What she exposed in her best known work ? Lajja (shame) ? was to expose what fanatic Muslims were doing to innocent non-Muslim Bangladeshis. 

 It needed a lot of courage on her part to do so. We have many Indian writers castigating Hindu fanatics who victimize Indian Muslims. We have a proud tradition of giving asylum to people who are persecuted in their own countries. A shining example of our extending hospitality to those whose lives were in danger was the way Hindu rajahs of western states allowed Zoroastrian victims of Iranian persecution to make their homes in India. Today Parsis are the pride of India. Why is the present government dragging its feet in offering asylum and security to Taslima Nasreen?

 Biharis in a cockfight

 Paswan lambasted Lalu, Lalu pilloried 

 Paswan

 At every public place, in every open lawn.

 As Union Ministers, they stood like rocks

 In assembly elections, they fought like cocks.

 United in Delhi, they were divided in Bihar,

 Were they colleagues or rivals at war?

 How funny is politics desi!

 Three cheers for Indian democracy!

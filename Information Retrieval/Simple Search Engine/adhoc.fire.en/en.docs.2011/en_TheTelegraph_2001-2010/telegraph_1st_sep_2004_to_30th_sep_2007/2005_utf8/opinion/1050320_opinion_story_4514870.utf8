 HOW THE RACE WAS WON 

 - ?You can?t be miserly if you want to remain the chief minister?

When horses bolt, there is little politicians can do. 

The Jharkhand story ? just days after Arjun Munda?s government took over ? is 

still unfolding. And, as always, it?s money that?s swinging the odds. Uttam Sengupta 

provides a turfside view 

 It?s not often that the Central Bureau of Investigation is urged to look into political ?horse-trading?. But Jharkhand?s Shibu Soren ? the man who would be, but couldn?t be, chief minister ? has good reasons for demanding a probe. After all, he wasn?t accused just of indulging in horse-trading by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), but was also at the receiving end of it for allowing loyal horses to bolt to the other side. He, more than anyone else, would know that a proper inquiry could dig up mud that would stick. The United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government at the Centre, smarting after being outmanoeuvred by the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Jharkhand, could well be tempted to collect bits of evidence to show up the BJP. 

 Not that Jharkhand would need a Sherlock Holmes to get to the bottom of the intrigue. The loose and indiscreet talk about Jharkhand?s politicians have left a trail that is still hot. Congress leader R.K. Anand complains that it was for the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) to arrange for the money needed (to buy the loyalty of MLAs). ?Kanjoosi karne se kaise mukhyamantri raheeyega (you can?t be miserly if you want to remain the chief minister),? exclaims an exasperated Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader, Girinath Singh, in a private conversation, 

 Political leaders claim that money ? or lack of it ? was never a consideration because there were men with briefcases hovering around Soren, ready to pay if the former Union coal minister gave the signal. For money, they argue, was at the crux of who would rule Jharkhand, and who wouldn?t. 

 Switch over

 Newly sworn-in minister Eunos Ekka?s story is a case in point. Niel Tirkey, Congress Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA), blows hot and cold when it comes to his prot?g? who switched sides from the Congress to the NDA in the blink of an eye. Ekka, he says philosophically, had taken loans from different sources to contest the election and build a house for himself. Tirkey says he understands that Ekka would be tempted to accept an offer that would help him clear his debts. 

 He flares up the next moment when he spots a newspaper photograph of Ekka getting a facial done before taking oath as an NDA minister. ?Look at this man ? he couldn?t even afford to visit a village barber. He would sit on a brick and his friends would give him a haircut and now he visits a men?s salon.? Tirkey?s diatribe continues. ?Look at what the BJP has done to him. A week ago, his driver was driving a jeep. And today I see him driving a Tata Safari.? 

 That a drama was set to unfold became clear by the afternoon of February 27, as results of the elections to the Jharkand Assembly came in. Congress and JMM leaders were reconciled to a coalition government. Their first task was to placate a sulking Laloo Yadav so as to secure the support of his seven MLAs. Their next job was to bring together Soren and Stephen Marandi, a JMM rebel who shocked the former CM by defeating his son. The rest, they reckoned, would be easy. Left parties, the Nationalist Congress Party and the RJD would add 11 MLAs to the JMM-Congress combine?s 26, bringing their tally to 37. Securing the support of four additional MLAs would not pose much of a problem, they concluded. 

 Musclemen

 But the BJP, meanwhile, had begun to flex its organisational muscle. Two vehicles were dispatched past midnight on February 27 to Kolebira, Simdega. BJP?s emissaries established contact at 3 am with the unlikeliest MLA of them all. Eunos Ekka, a Christian, had triumphed as a Jharkhand Party nominee, defeating a veteran Congress leader, Theodore Kiro. The UPA took Ekka?s support for granted, partly because of his closeness to Tirkey. 

 But the BJP was not taking any chances. The party had apparently funded Ekka?s election campaign ? a strategy to ensure the defeat of Congress and JMM nominees in constituencies where the BJP was on a weaker wicket. The BJP now wanted its pound of flesh and informed Ekka that a helicopter would pick him up the next day for a meeting with senior leaders. 

 Ekka, however, had already agreed to travel to Ranchi by road with Tirkey. When Tirkey turned up in the morning to pick him up, Ekka assured him that he would follow in his own jeep. Tirkey later called him and suggested that they stop at Basia for lunch. Ekka agreed. But when Tirkey next spoke to him, he could hear the sounds of a chopper. Ekka was apologetic. 

 A ?friend?, he said, had suddenly appeared with a helicopter and he had opted for the faster ride to Ranchi. He assured Tirkey that he would reach the Congress office ? but never did. Instead, he accompanied an NDA delegation to the Raj Bhavan the next day, pledging his support for the BJP-led alliance. 

 A different drama was being enacted in a suite at the Arya Hotel, owned by the defeated Congress candidate from Ranchi, Gopal Sahu. BJP rebel Madhu Koda was being wooed by R.K. Anand. Congress sources claim that Koda wanted Rs 4 crore with an immediate first instalment of Rs 50 lakh. Anand confirms that the MLA was with him till 3 am, when he was finally escorted to Soren. 

 Niel Tirkey takes up the thread of the tale. He received a call from an exasperated Koda the next day. Koda complained that Guruji (as Soren is known) gave him a lecture on politics and morality, declaring that he did not have the kind of money Koda was demanding. Koda fled, and later told Tirkey that he had met Guruji to collect his price and not to listen to a lecture. 

 Another MLA, Harinarayan Rai, also bolted to the NDA camp the same night. He was seen hovering in the lobby and around the first-floor suite of an ITDC hotel where JMM leaders Soren and Hemlal Murmu had holed up for their trysts. But the next day, Rai too accompanied the NDA delegation to Raj Bhavan to demonstrate his support for the BJP-led alliance. 

 Insiders reason that he did not get what he wanted from the UPA and opted for the NDA. Fumes Anand: ?Humne to unhe MLAs de deeya; ab rakh nahin paaye to kya karein? (we delivered the MLAs to Soren; how can we help if he fails to retain them?).? 

 With Koda, Rai and Ekka pitching their lot with the NDA, the die had been cast. The BJP had already closed the deal with the two MLAs belonging to the All Jharkhand Students? Union (AJSU), Sudesh Mahto and Chandraprakash Chaudhary, and the ?famous five? had taken the NDA tally beyond the half-way mark. Both Rai and Ekka, however, continued to figure in the UPA list, with Soren insisting that they had been abducted. 

 Hindi, please

 So much so that a documentary filmmaker from New Delhi and JMM activist, Prabal Mahto, was asked to visit Jaipur and establish contact with Rai and Ekka, who had been bundled off to a resort along with other MLAs supporting the NDA. Mahto, a former journalist, agreed but confessed later that he had no hope of meeting the MLAs. But he bumped into a senior BJP leader from Rajasthan with whom he was acquainted in his former avatar as a journalist. The unsuspecting leader invited him into the resort and reassured the others, ?Ghabrane ki baat nahin hai; yeh apna hi aadmi hai (no reason to get flustered, he is one of our own).? 

 Mahto sauntered in and eventually came face to face with Ekka. He started conversing in the ?Ho? dialect, recalls Mahto, and managed to elicit three sentences from Ekka before they aroused the suspicion of the supervisors. Please speak in Hindi, they were sternly told. ?I immediately switched over to English and the tension eased,? says Mahto. ?They all had a good laugh and informed me that Ekka was not familiar with English.? 

 The mission was far from successful, but Mahto says he got the impression Ekka was ill at ease. He also claims that Ekka asked him not to ask inconvenient questions. Curiously, while at Jaipur, Ekka had access to mobile telephones and spoke freely to both ?friends? and journalists. To journalists he said he could support the UPA if his conditions were met. Asked to spell out his demands, Ekka fumbled for words, before blurting out that Congress should first expel veteran Congressman Theodore Kiro. 

 Cornered

 Xavier Dias, a Ranchi-based activist, claims that Ekka was in touch with his ?best friend? and had hinted that he was being blackmailed. Dias suggests they might have photographed him with call girls. 

 The friend, Dias claims, had rebuked Ekka for having sold himself for Rs 5 crore. Ekka apparently replied that he had no way of extricating himself from the web. ?Hum phans gaye hain ? nikalna mushkil hai,? Dias recalls him telling the friend. 

 For five days till Arjun Munda finally won the trial of strength in the Assembly, the five legislators were confined to the ITDC hotel in Ranchi. They would be bundled into a bus every day, escorted to the Assembly and brought back to the hotel. 

 CBI or no CBI enquiry, the writing on the wall is for all to read. But in Jharkhand, the horse-trading has evoked little consternation. If anything, there is a reluctant admiration for the BJP for pulling off a ?stable coup?. And the Congress-JMM may possibly have learnt ? if a little late ? that there is little to gain from closing the stable doors after the horses have bolted.

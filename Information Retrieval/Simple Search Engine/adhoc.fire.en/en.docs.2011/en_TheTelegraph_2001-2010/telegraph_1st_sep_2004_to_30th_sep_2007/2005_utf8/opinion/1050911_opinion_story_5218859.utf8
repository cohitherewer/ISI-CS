 DIARY

 The winds of change are blowing in the saffron camp. And while most of the changes have been painful affairs (think LK Advani), there?s something positive to be said for at least some of the transformations that are currently taking place in the RSS. A few days ago the newspapers were full of the debate in Jhandewalan about whether pracharaks should be allowed to marry. And now, its mouthpiece, the Organiser, under its new editor, R Balashankar, has started carrying matrimonials. Obviously with the change in editor, there has been a change in editorial policy too. Thus the magazine will not be confined to just politics and religion as it was under its ideologically more rigorous editors like the man Balashankar succeeded, Seshadri Chari. The new Organiser is to become more ?society and family oriented? to keep up with the changing times. And it?s also displaying a new gender sensitivity ? the parents of boys will have to pay more for the ads. An ad for a suitable bridegroom will cost Rs 251, while that for a suitable bride will cost Rs 401. The magazine had better be careful that like the BJP, it doesn?t loose its traditional constituency in its search for a new one. 

 Why is it that Naveen Patnaik is always being run down by his own partymen and even the BJP, while the Congress central leadership can?t stop singing his praise? A few months ago, Shivraj Patil was volubly appreciative of the lack of law and order problems in Orissa. Then Oscar Fernandes rushed to give Naveen a ?clean chit?, and just last week, Ghulam Nabi Azad waxed eloquent about Naveen ensuring peace in Orissa, which was more than what its Congress CM had done for Haryana. Is it simply human nature, a tendency to look down on home-grown talent, that explains the way the BJD and BJP regard, or disregard, Naveen? But what is the Congress?s gameplan in playing up to Naveen?

 The Chidambarams may have emerged unscathed from it, but the ghost of the controversy surrounding Nalini?s fighting a case for the CBDT will not leave the couple in a hurry. The matter was not far from the minds of the Women?s Press Corps which was hosting a Q amp;A with the visiting Cherie Blair, another high-profile lawyer married to a politician. Would you fight a case for the government, someone asked. Never. In fact, she?d fought two cases against the government and won, Cherie added. It seems Mrs Chidambaram will have to look for new clients. 

 Politicians are not known for their sensitivity. But even among politicians, Vilasrao Deshmukh takes the cake. A few days ago, he called on Sonia Gandhi armed with a clippings file on Hurricane Katrina. However many the charges levelled against his government for mismanaging the Mumbai floods, at least there hadn?t been any rapes or thefts in the city, he told her. He had more comparative statistics ? so many inches of rain in New Orleans, so many in Mumbai; so many deaths in the American city, so many here, and so on. Didn?t know Mumbai was in competition with New Orleans ? wasn?t it supposed to be another Shanghai?

 But not all politicians are objectionable. There?s one, and a first time parliamentarian at that, Jairam Ramesh, who?s made such a good impression that he may well bag the Best Parliamentarian Award this year. Not only does he score highly on attendance, but also on articulation. But what sets him apart is his good humour in the face of barbs and his ability to acknowledge the virtues even of opposition leaders. Whew, what a paragon!

 Ramesh?s colleague, Anil Shastri, may not be a paragon, but he does have a larger-than-life self-image. Out of work in the party and government, the son of Lal Bahadur Shastri went to Kathmandu recently, ostensibly to strengthen relations with the Nepali Congress. As luck would have it, a day after Shastri?s meeting with Girija Prasad Koirala, the latter was arrested. Ever since he has come back, Shastri has been full of how great a success his trip to Nepal was, rattling even the king and forcing him to detain Koirala.

 How the BJP must wish that Uma Bharti would direct even a fraction of her trouble-making skills at the opposition. If nothing else, it would make life easier for those within the party. Those like Sanjay Joshi, the party?s gen-sec, would not then be caught off guard by the scene the sanyasin created inside the party headquarters the other day. Bharti had a legitimate demand ? a suitable assignment for herself. But she had a unique manner of going about it ? she sat in dharna outside the rooms Joshi occupies on the premises. The clock kept ticking away but there was no budging Bharti. A bachelor, Joshi called up the office secretary, Shyam Jaju, and his wife for help, but even they failed to get better sense to prevail upon Bharti. Finally, Rajnath Singh had to be called in late at night. It isn?t known what he promised, but he did prevail upon Bharti to vacate her post. And so all that sound and fury ended up being for nothing.

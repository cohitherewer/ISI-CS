 Letters to Editor

 Forgive and forget?

 Sir ? It is difficult to decide which is funnier ? Charles, Prince of Wales, and Camilla Parker-Bowles walking the aisle, or Charles asking forgiveness of Andrew Parker-Bowles (?Charles told to atone for adultery?, March 28). What is not funny at all is the Church of England demanding that Charles alone atones for adultery. Was not Camilla committing the same ?sin? when she was seeing the prince while enjoying the official status of Mrs Andrew Parker-Bowles? And while we are on the subject of atonement, what about Charles asking forgiveness of the departed soul of Diana ? for leading her into a royal farce of a marriage, and carrying on his affair with Camilla even after that without so much as a pang of conscience? But of course, if the Church is only interested in making the prince pay it a price for its compliance, then these questions are unlikely to bother them.

 Yours faithfully,

Sunandaa Sarkar, Calcutta

 Crack the code

 Sir ? Instead of arguing to the point on the uniform civil code, Nivedita Menon has unnecessarily dragged into her discussion the Gujarat riots (?A debate among men?, March 23). Her view that ?Narendra Modi...personally presided over the massacre of Muslims in Gujarat? betrays her ignorance. She is evidently unaware of the magnitude of a state-sponsored holocaust. Hitler presided over one, and it resulted in the death of six million Jews, Pol Pot liquidated two million Cambodians, Stalin killed thousands. Had Modi really ?presided? over a pogrom, at least a few thousand Muslims would have been killed. The death toll in Gujarat barely crossed a thousand, and the number of Hindus in it was 200-plus. 

 Menon also counters Modi?s statement that ?the Muslim who goes to the United States of America must practise the civil code there? with the claim that several Hindus in the US clamour for their right to celebrate Hindu festivals and build Hindu temples. Perhaps she needs to be explained that civil codes have nothing to do with religious observances.

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? There are 57 Muslim countries in the world, and they follow the Islamic laws, which go back several centuries but are still alive. In India, the Hindu laws were properly defined as late as the 20th century. The character of Hinduism also changes from one part of India to another. And India is not a ?Hindu rashtra?, but a secular state. In any attempt at making a uniform civil code, there is bound to be a majoritarian bias, which will be unfair to the millions of Muslims, Christians and other minorities of the country. But why try to homogenize a society whose principal charm lies in the diversity of its religion, culture and lifestyle?

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Nivedita Menon has approached the uniform civil code from the feminist perspective alone. But the principle of the code has something to do with the issue of secularism also. The proponents of Hindutva regard it as an instrument to assert themselves over the minorities, progressive Indians consider it as a tool to establish a truly egalitarian society and feminists see it as a means to establish equality of status among women, cutting across religious barriers in the country. Whatever the impediments in the other spheres, the implementation of a uniform civil code is a must to establish gender justice in India.

 Yours faithfully,

Jayotee Bhattacharjee, Silchar

 Sir ? Why do people like Nivedita Menon shed crocodile tears for the minorities, instead of raising their voice against shameful practices like the triple talaq? What have activists and feminists like her done to provide legal support to women who have been given the talaq? The uniform civil code can be modified to address gender issues: it can also include ?more liberal provisions for women?. The Hindutva parties have not obtained any patent on this code, nor is there any basis for the apprehension that their writ will run. If the uniform civil code is an attempt to pulverize the identity of the minorities, why don?t Christians, Parsis, or Buddhists resist it as much? This hypocrisy among our intellectuals will only strengthen the fundamentalist maulvis and ulemas. And we can go on contemplating a model legislation while the Shah Banos continue to pay the price.

 Yours faithfully, 

Debasish Bhattacharjee, Guwahati

 Sir ? It is because of the narrow-minded intervention of some shrewd politicians like Narendra Modi that several Hindu laws are still steeped in patriarchal bias. India is yet to produce open-minded and fearless politicians who will boldly ensure that human rights is the priority when laws are framed. In Modi?s dictionary, ?secularism? may mean ?appeasement of the minorities?, but has he ever spared a thought about some of the barbaric Hindu laws which still stand as a mark of the Indian polity?s appeasement of patriarchy? Laws are always at the risk of bias and perversion in the hands of unscrupulous politicians like Modi who are driven by a fanatic political agenda.

 Yours faithfully,

Tanmoy Bhattacharjee, Howrah

 THE OLD HAS ITS USES

 NEHA SAHAY

 Shanghai: skyscrapers, curved, jagged-edged, with stylized lighting; traffic jams, police physically stopping motorcyclists and pedestrians from breaking signals; narrow pavements, everyone well-dressed and in a hurry; aggressive beggars, and the world?s fastest train, Maglev ? that?s the kind of city Mumbai?s planners dream of. What about Shanghai?s clean public toilets, all-day-open free parks and pedestrian plazas?

 There?s a dark side to China?s 21st century city too ? literally. Shanghai has vast stretches devoid of people after 9 pm. And these aren?t only office areas. Even many fancy Western restaurants close by nine. One young woman who has just moved here from a small city in south China, finds she can no longer go to discos or karaoke bars as she used to. In Shanghai, her life centres around office and home. Big cities teach single girls to be adventurous; Shanghai had taught this girl to cook!

 But if parts of it sleep early, Shanghai also rises at dawn. Six am onwards, senior citizens start tai chi in the huge municipal park. There are just about six youngsters out of 200 in a park, most of them living up to the stereotype: busy on mobiles and laptops, gulping down breakfast while cutting across the park; or just catching 40 winks. Will tai chi survive this generation of 60- year-olds?

 Sleepless in the city

 But parts of Shanghai never sleep. Nanjing East Street, said to be the best-known shopping street in China, is a-glitter till midnight. Another part which comes to life at night is Xintiandi. Part of the old ?French Concession? (after the British defeated China in the first Opium War of 1842, Western nations carved out parts of Shanghai for themselves), it became a refuge for foreigners during the 19th century anti-foreigner Taiping Rebellion. Ironically, it?s the favourite haunt of Western tourists today. The traditional grey brick houses with stone gates have been rebuilt in the old style. They now house upmarket caf?s, boutiques and luxurious apartments. 

 You can spend the entire evening drinking freshly brewed German beer on the pavement tables, listening to jazz bands and watching the series of tour groups descend to savour the atmosphere. A museum recreates the old life-style, but doesn?t tell you where the 8,000 inhabitants of the original old crumbling homes, which had neither individual toilets nor a drainage system worth the name, were relocated when Xintiandi was rebuilt between 1994 and 1998.

 Tourists only

 During the day, whites put up their feet and catch up on their reading over cups of the best international coffee. Ironically, just next door to them, within Xintiandi, is the place where the final movement that ousted their governments from China began. House No 106, undistinguishable from the others here, was the site of the first national congress of the Chinese Communist Party. On July 23, 1921, 13 delegates from all over China, and two from the Comintern, met in this building, then home to one of them. In 1952, the house was turned into a museum. Wax figures reconstruct the scene where Mao Zedong stood up to make a point, and the inscriptions below the portraits of the 13 tell you who among them turned traitor and who remained with the party.

 In the ?Old City?, which remained under Chinese control during the colonial years, you can pay 25 yuan for a cup of tea in a centuries-old tea house, trying hard to believe you?re back in a more leisurely era, while outside, noisy tourists rush through the sights. Then there?s Old Shanghai spread out through the city: old, decrepit, ungainly four-storeyed buildings, where grandmothers wash vegetables on the pavement and children play on the streets. Not at all touristy, hence facing demolition.

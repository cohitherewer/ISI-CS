 ELEGY FOR THE TIGER

 MALVIKA SINGH

 The very recent news about poached tigers in Ranthambhore over the last couple of years has been scary, because it reflects the total lack of governance of those who police our reserved forests and national parks, including Project Tiger. For years we have known how babus are not accountable any more, how political pressures compel the top leadership to ?protect? those who have faulted, those who have broken the rules that they themselves make for the ?rest?. 

 Anyone watching, studying and worshipping the tiger knows that the king of the jungle is on the verge of becoming extinct in the wild. When experts warned the PMO and other authorities. They were not taken seriously because the babus covered up the truth in their version of the horror that was unfolding when they made the presentation to the top leadership of this land. Reality was fudged to save their own skin at the cost of saving the skin of the tiger. The prime minister was presented with ?half truths?. He half-believed the independent ?protestor?. He instituted a Tiger Task Force, at the helm of which he appointed a person with no understanding of the tiger but whose agenda was to right the wrongs inflicted on tribals. The tragedy was that the ?findings? and the ?solutions? elaborated became a tiger vs tribal debate that has harmed both the exploited parties. This was so typical of government probes where a basic lack of knowledge creates more monsters.

 The ?tiger issue? was set aside by the press for a while. The babu heaved a sigh of relief as the heat abated. The ?debate? was deftly adjusted to questions that arose out of the draft of the tribal rights bill that the UPA desperately wants to push through. Here too the prime minister intervened and encouraged a reassessment. And, here again, bureaucrats in his office, who are synonymous with the bill, are desperately pushing it through, conscious of their overriding power and political support. 

 State of denial

 Another chapter in this saga revealed that an uninterrupted export of tiger and leopard skins was taking place with China and there was abundant availability in Lhasa. The PMO and the Tiger Task Force were nowhere to be seen on the revelations of this new illegality. Now the killers, some of whom are tribals living in the vicinity of Ranthambhore, have told us how many tigers they have murdered. Silence from the PMO and the Task Force. 

 Project Tiger, set up by Indira Gandhi, seems to be in a state of denial as it witnesses the tiger descend into the realm of the dinosaur. Indira Gandhi, often described as Durga whose vahana is a tiger, was a proactive prime minister, committed to the conservation of the natural environment. She fought the battles that restored our natural habitat and the species that reside within the forests from Silent Valley to Ranthambhore. She never allowed her babus to pull the cotton over her sharp and perceptive eyes. There is a lesson to be learned. 

 In civilized societies, where governance is clean and dignified and not held to ransom like in our country by those who have fixed tenures, those who are never fired, only transferred ? the men and women responsible for the failure of their department would be told to step down. In today?s India this morality seems to have passed into oblivion. There is a degradation of values. And, if a citizen protests, goes against the mandate of the babu, exposes illegalities, thereby unravelling the edifice of their ivory tower, unprecedented harassment ensues, threats are forthcoming, lies are spoken, false accusations made, all because the state apparatus is in their hands, and they are not accountable with the state having overwhelmed our lives with corrupt intrusions.

 The tiger truth is in the public space and the government with its acolytes is in a state of denial.

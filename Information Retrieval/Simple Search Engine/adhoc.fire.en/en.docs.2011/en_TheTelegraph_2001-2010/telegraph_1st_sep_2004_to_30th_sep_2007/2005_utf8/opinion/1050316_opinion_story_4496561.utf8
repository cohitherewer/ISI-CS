 CLEAN THE BOX

 Censorship and a mature democracy are at odds with each other. Yet a government that calls itself ?progressive? has joined hands with its political opponents to create yet another ?regulatory body? that would police private television channels for sex and violence. The information and broadcasting ministry under the National Democratic Alliance would do these things with great aplomb, and a certain conviction. Everything, from music videos to HIV awareness campaigns, would be subjected to its love of echt Indian purity. The United Progressive Alliance lacks this conviction. The I amp;B minister, Mr Jaipal Reddy, has assured some worried Rajya-Sabha members ? Ms Sushma Swaraj among them ? that the government is thinking about a regulatory authority for TV programmes, since a bill is yet to take shape. But Mr Reddy has also made it very clear to these concerned parliamentarians that his ministry would not consider censorship of the kind that exists for films.

 This is marvellously double-faced ? will regulate, but won?t censor. So morality and democracy will both be preserved, and young India will remain as pure as driven snow. And the government seems to be going about this with a sort of half-hearted elaborateness. There was a workshop recently in the capital which involved the ministry, the police and the censor board, together with media heads, cable operator federations, NGOs, educationists, women and consumer organizations. All here seemed to be against censorship and for self-regulation ? until the government put in place proper regulatory bodies and laws. What exactly is the difference between regulation that is overseen by the state and censorship? The answer to this question ? which nobody seems at all intent on asking ? might mean the difference between a confused democracy and a mature one. Families exist not only to watch TV together but also to regulate what sort of entertainment children might be given access to. The point that ?moral? and ?immoral?, ?obscene? and ?innocent? are subjective categories the definitions of which are best left to private discretion and choice should, by now, have become too obvious to sensible adults. Ministers and parliamentarians ought to keep themselves busy with more objective immoralities, of which there should be plenty.

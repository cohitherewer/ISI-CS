 CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON 

 For the first time in recent years, the chairman of a public sector enterprise has publicly taken on government bureaucrats ? and won. ONGC chairman Subir Raha, like the tiger, is flamboyant and sometimes fierce

 Not for nothing do they call him Sheru. Not to his face, of course, for Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) chairman and managing director Subir Raha is known for his sudden roars. But the sobriquet that employees of the countrys largest revenue earner have coined for him befits the man who has been stalking his prey for a while. 

 You can hate him or love him ? but you can ignore a tiger only at your own peril. Which is what a section of the government discovered this week. 

 Subir Raha pounced on the government when it tried to control his writ over Indias most valued company ever. The government had hoped to foist on to the ONGC two of its nominees ? director-general of Hydrocarbons, V.K. Sibal and industries secretary, M.S. Srinivasan. Raha not just stymied the move but threatened to resign. And, in a no-holds-barred bout at its annual general meeting on Wednesday, the ONGC head took the government on ? and won the first round. 

 In the corporate world, opinion is divided on whether or not to celebrate. Some people somewhere are chalking out the next stage of the Raha-sidelining endeavour. But Raha himself is no doubt toasting with his favourite single malt, the smooth-flowing Glenfiddich. 

 Some ? like S.L. Rao, former chairman of the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission ? believe that there is a larger story there ? and one that needs to be told. The whole tragedy of the Indian public sector has been that bureaucrats and ministers treat public sector enterprises as their personal fiefdoms, forgetting that they belong to the people, says Rao, who is also the former director general of the National Council of Applied Economic Research. 

 I dont think theres any question that Raha is right. ONGC is a listed company, with shareholders, he says. To object to the presence of Sibal on the ONGC board is 100 per cent correct. Its like putting TRAI chairman Pradeep Baijal on the BSNL board. 

 For 57-year-old Raha ? who studied electronics and telecommuncation engineering at Jadavpur University in the late Sixties ? the controversy would be all a part of the game, for he is a man who has often been in the line of fire. His detractors in the oil industry describe him as a downstream man ? more into oil products, refining and marketing than upstream, or exploration, which is the ONGCs main task. Which is why, this section believes, ONGCs oil production has been hovering at around 26 million tonnes for the last three years. 

 His supporters, on the other hand, point out that it is under him that ONGC has turned into a Rs 47,245-crore company. In 1999, management consultants McKinsey had predicted that the Indian navratna ? a profit-making public sector unit ? would soon be a sick company. But under Raha, an old Indian Oil hand who joined ONGC in May 2001, net profits more than doubled from Rs 6,198 crore in 2001-2002 to Rs 12,983 crore in 2004-2005. Hes trying to clean up ONGC, to stem the rot in terms of corruption, says Rao. Hes a very straight man, very clever and intelligent. 

 A workaholic ? he is said to be on the job for 18 hours a day ? the chain-smoking Raha, all agree, is an able manager. He really thinks on his feet, says an associate. After a very long time we have seen a CMD of a PSU who has excellent management capabilities. If given a free reign, he, with his ability and expertise, will convert ONGC into a truly world-class organisation, adds a retired oil industry company chairman. 

 He is is also known as a shrewd negotiator. We saw things started moving in Petronet LNG once Raha came in. He is such a hard negotiator that he puts others to shame, says the head of an oil company. 

 But the man, most agree, has a dictatorial side to him. Some describe him as brusque, a few call him stand-offish. He transfers people left, right and centre, points out a Raha watcher. He is headstrong, he says of the much-awarded vice-president of the All India Management Association, a body which he is slated to head in 2007. 

 To his friends, he is an affable man, fond of, though not necessarily in that order, Earl Gray tea, Rabindra Sangeet, Hindustani classical music and mutton cooked with spring onions. He likes his Urdu couplets and is known to SMS jokes and couplets to his friends. 

 He is a true Royal Bengal Tiger, says a friend. Like the tiger, always flamboyant and sometimes fierce. 

 The metaphor does seem to follow him around. Or is it just a mere coincidence that today is World Tiger Day? And efforts are on to save the tiger?

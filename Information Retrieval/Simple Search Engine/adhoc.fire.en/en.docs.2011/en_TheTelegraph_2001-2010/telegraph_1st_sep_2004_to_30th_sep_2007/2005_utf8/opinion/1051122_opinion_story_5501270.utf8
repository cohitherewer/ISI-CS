 Letters to Editor

 Is there a healthy option?

 Sir ? Gouri Rani Chakraborty?s death and the appalling ?treatment? she received prior to it, is yet another reminder of the poor medical services available in the hospitals of our city (?Death after ant bites?, Nov 16). These hospitals have turned into virtual death-traps. Gouri Rani?s case has too many anomalies. The doctors did not take adequate precautions after the operation, given that she was highly diabetic. The state government should probe if Gouri Rani?s death was caused by medical neglect. The biggest lesson of this incident perhaps is that it is impossible to get quality medical care in Bengal with a light pocket. 

 Yours faithfully,

Nivedita Roychowdhury, Calcutta

 Sir ? What exactly caused Gouri Rani Chakraborty?s death at the Sambhunath Pandit Hospital is open to investigation. But the fact remains that the patient?s cries for help went unheard throughout the night, as the nurses on duty pretended not to hear her. The medical superintendent has brushed the matter aside saying that this can always happen to a diabetic patient. Will either the nurses on duty or the superintendent be pulled up for this criminal neglect? The death has added a new chapter to the sordid tale of our government hospitals, where new-born babies are eaten by dogs, and cats are known to eat up meals meant for patients. Those who can afford it, including ministers and political leaders, go abroad for treatment. The chief minister has already asked people to seek private help. But will private nursing homes be accessible to the common people?

 Yours faithfully, 

 Manish Chandra Bose, Calcutta 

 Sir ? That commitment is a word absent from the vocabulary of medical officers and para-medical personnel of our government hospitals is an accepted truth. So one should not be surprised that Gouri Rani Chakraborty?s attending nurse, Shikha Pal, did not respond to the fifty-year old lady?s cries for help. The acting superintendent of Sambhunath Pandit Hospital, Subrata Adhikary, kept assuring the patient?s family members that she would not lose her vision despite a gaping hole in the eye. Doctors are now claiming that she died of multiple organ failure, caused by severe diabetes. It is true that a different hospital had made the mistake of operating on Gouri Rani without bringing down her sugar level, but that does not absolve Sambhunath Pandit Hospital of the blame of letting her sink further for want of proper medical attention. 

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

 Sir ? A lot of hue and cry has been raised over the death of an elderly patient at a state hospital after ants fed on her operated eyes. But that is only because the media have decided to highlight the case. There must be many such deaths which go unreported, specially in the hospitals and health centres in rural areas. The chief minister seems to be trying his best to improve matters in the state hospitals (shouldn?t the health minister be making these efforts?), but words will not do the trick. A better infrastructure and healthy work culture might change the picture to some extent. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sudarsan Nandi, Midnapore

 Sir ? West Bengal is facing a serious crisis as far as government-run hospitals are concerned. Maladministration, insufficient equipment, shortage of efficient staff are some of the ills plaguing our hospitals. Unfortunately, most people have to remain at the mercy of these institutions. Who can say that Gouri Rani Chakraborty could not have been saved if the hospital staff were sensitive and dutiful? With a health system like this, I wonder how successful the chief minister will be in selling Brand Bengal to foreign investors. Shouldn?t he at least ask for the health minister?s resignation?

 Yours faithfully, 

Koyel Basu, Calcutta

 Sir ? Gouri Rani Chakraborty?s case is not the first one exposing the criminal neglect of the staff of government hospitals. The identifying features of government hospitals are that they are overcrowded, and they compromise on hygiene and efficiency. On the one hand, the state is fast emerging as a destination for health tourism, and on the other, the resident evils of lethargy and irresponsibility still prevail in the state-run health centres. The government is not interested any more in upgrading them, it wants greater privatization. But then, private hospitals should bring their facilities within the reach of the average citizen.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan 

 Sir ? Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s call of ?Do it now? is not reaching the doctors and nurses of state hospitals. This does not augur well for the state and its people. The dismal incident at Sambhunath Pandit Hospital throws poor light on the state?s healthcare system. When will it be possible for the ?development-oriented? chief minister?s West Bengal to have some quality healthcare facilities?

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

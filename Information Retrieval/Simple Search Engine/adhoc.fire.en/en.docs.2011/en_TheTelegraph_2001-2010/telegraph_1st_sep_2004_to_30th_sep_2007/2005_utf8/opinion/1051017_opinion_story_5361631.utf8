 TROUBLED LAND

 It is not always enough to wish very hard for democracy. The draft constitution in Iraq has angered the Sunni minority, and many of them went to vote in the referendum on it simply to say ?no?. That in order to vote they braved threats from rebel leaders and rose above their own disillusion with the way the constitution has been framed to favour ? as they perceive it ? Shia and Kurdish interests is as far as democracy has gone yet. The draft was not framed democratically, according to the Sunni members of the drafting committee: they were misled and sidelined in the negotiations. The Shia and Kurd-dominated ruling coalition has enough seats in parliament to push the draft through without Sunni consensus. The fear of civil war was the deterrent here. But fear works both ways. Last August, when the draft was presented in parliament, the Sunnis were given three days to agree to the deal or risk losing political power. And one question that is being raised is about the democratic credentials of a process overlooked by resident foreign powers.

 The Sunnis? objections do not spring merely from anger at their loss of status, given that they were the most powerful group when the Baath party was ruling. Their misgivings go deeper. A federalist Iraq, which the draft constitution envisages, would leave the Sunnis at a serious disadvantage. They are concentrated in the central provinces that produce no oil. The Kurds have their own region in the north, and Shias are asking for self-rule in the south. These are the oil-producing areas. Although current oil revenues will be shared, revenues from future developments will go to the Shia and Kurdish governments. On top of that, the Sunnis have a very real fear of the break-up of Iraq. Their attitude is largely of a pan-Arab nationalism, while the Kurds have their own interests and the Shias turn towards their own sect in Iran. Insurgent violence has persisted since 2003, and it will go badly for Iraq if the Sunnis react violently to Shia majority rule. The fact that the Iraqis decided to use the ballot, however, indicates that they are hoping for change.

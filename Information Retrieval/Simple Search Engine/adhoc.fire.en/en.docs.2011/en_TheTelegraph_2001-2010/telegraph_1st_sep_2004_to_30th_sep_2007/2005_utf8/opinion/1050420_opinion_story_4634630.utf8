 Letters to Editor

 Sign of ill health

 In many of the advertisements in the print media issued by the ministry of health and family welfare regarding pulse polio on April 17, a large picture of Sonia Gandhi was displayed. The Congress president was shown as chairperson of the national advisory council, which is an internal arrangement within the United Progressive Alliance government, and not a constitutional post. The advertisements, thus, do not speak very highly of the government, which pays shortshrift to its own prime minister. In the programme at the Wagah border to mark the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service, Sonia Gandhi?s pictures were again visible, and they once again indicated the shameless promotion of an individual over the government and and the people of the country. This is an insult to a multi-party democracy, besides being a sign of bad taste. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? After the death of the two boys in an accident caused by a truck fleeing from policemen, the deputy commissioner of police, traffic, acknowledged corruption in the force but pleaded his inability to do anything (?Wheels of bribe crush two boys?, April 11). Soon, the joint commissioner of police, traffic, passed the buck to the media or camera-wielding citizens by saying that they should provide ?evidence?. But apart from taking bribe, policemen break traffic rules in collusion with others. Which is why army and police vehicles, corporation vans and cars with government of West Bengal number plates ignore one-way street signs and park in no-parking zones. 

 It is possible that the lower levels of the police force are a frustrated lot, given their salary and the fact that they have to witness their seniors getting away with more dishonourable behaviour than bribe-taking. Add to this the civic mismanagement that multiplies their responsibility. Every day, more and more pavements are getting permanently blocked by hawkers, there are mini-temples on many with devotees spilling onto the streets, or there are Friday prayers that hold up traffic for two hours at a stretch. But why should the people on the street, especially children, have to pay the price for this?

 Yours faithfully,

Gouranga Chattopadhyay,

 Sir ? It was disheartening to hear that two young children had lost their lives in another accident (?Rogue truck kills sisters? April 15). We seem to be completely vulnerable to mistakes made by others. Trailers are not supposed to enter the Bondel gate area between 8.30 in the morning till 8.30 at night. Yet, the trailer was there and the reason for this is not difficult to ascertain ? the system. But trailer-drivers should not take the entire blame. The ones responsible are the law-keepers, and they are happily oblivious of it. Nabarun Bhattacharya, superintendent railway police (Sealdah division), even seems to have absolved his men by declaring that he has received no complaints about them receiving bribes. But if they haven?t why are there trailers and hawkers in places they shouldn?t be in? 

 Yours faithfully,

Sayantan Das, Konnagar

 Sir ? The pictures of the homeguard, taking bribe brazenly during peak office hours, in The Telegraph did not mention the area (?Crush of not, bribe goes on?, April 12). But from my knowledge of the business area, I can guess that it was the Brabourne Road-Canning Street crossing. We may recall that Canning Street is one-way and not used much by the vehicular traffic because of its acute congestion. But for these van-rickshaws, the road is open both ways, thanks to the policemen on duty. In fact, whenever policemen find 10-12 van-rickshaws accumulating on the road, they immediately hold up the traffic so that not a single rickshaw-puller slips away without paying. 

 Now let us come to the more serious aspect of the story. This was peak office time. Therefore, a sergeant was surely posted at the busy traffic intersection. It appears mysterious that the sergeant could not see the homeguard taking bribe right under his nose. The homeguard has been disciplined, why not the sergeant?

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

 Sir ? The police have started behaving like extortionists and yet Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee must insist that they are doing ?excellent work?. Calcuttans have seen how people are killed in police custody, how women are picked up from slums to be gangraped in the barracks, how drivers and hawkers are made to pay so that the police can get the comforts they seek. Yet they do not protest. Does this not prove that we, educated citizens of the cyber-age, are metamorphosing into selfish, insensitive and spineless individuals? 

 Yours faithfully,

Anjan Chatterjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? Honesty is vital to the job of a policeman. A starting point for the authorities is to discipline or dismiss police officers who are not willing to be professional in their dealings with the people who pay their wages. 

 Yours faithfully,

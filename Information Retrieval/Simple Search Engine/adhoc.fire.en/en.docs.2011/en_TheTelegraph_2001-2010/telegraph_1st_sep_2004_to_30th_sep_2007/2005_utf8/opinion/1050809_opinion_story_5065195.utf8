 HOW THE FIGURES ADD UP

 Alok Ray looks at what a revalued yuan means, both for India and the US

 Higher score

 After resisting pressures from the United States of America and Europe for a long time, China has now officially abandoned its 11-year old fixed rate between the Chinese yuan and the US dollar. To start with, the Chinese have allowed a small 2.1 per cent upward adjustment of the value of yuan against dollar.

 This is far less than 10-15 per cent revaluation at one stroke, which many had expected. Further, the Chinese are going to link the value of yuan to a basket of major currencies, though its composition has been kept a secret. They would allow the value of yuan to change within a band of 0.3 per cent either way from previous day?s closing rate. This may open the door for a creeping rather than a big change.

 The question that arises naturally is: why now and not earlier? First, many influential US congressmen (both Democrat and Republican) have recently rallied to press for penal import duties on Chinese goods unless China changed its rigid exchange rate policy. China has been running a massive trade surplus with the US for many years. Note that the global trade surplus of China was only $31 billion in 2004 whereas its trade surplus with the US was $175 billion. This had led many in the US to believe that China was getting an unfair advantage by not letting the yuan-dollar rate to be market-determined.

 Second, the friction with the US worsened when China, instead of investing its dollar reserves in low-interest US treasury bills, got busy trying to take over US companies. For example, one Chinese company has bought IBM?s PC business. Another state-owned Chinese oil company is now striving to buy Unocal, a US energy company. Many US politicians see this as a national security risk.

 This may have triggered China?s reversal of exchange rate policy to pacify US public opinion, especially before the scheduled US visit by the Chinese premier in September. Besides, China is still growing at a break-neck speed of around 9.5 per cent in the last quarter. Which means China can afford to have a lower trade surplus, and yet maintain a respectable growth rate of 7 per cent or so. If revaluation stops at a meagre 2 per cent against the US dollar, then this would not make any appreciable change in the overall trade balance for the US or China. However, if China believes that ?managed floating? is more ?floating? than ?managed?, then the yuan should continue to appreciate against the US dollar till the trade deficit of the US against China comes down to a more manageable level.

 What is going to happen to the value of dollar against other currencies like euro? If China allows a substantial revaluation of yuan against the US dollar in the days to come, then euro may go down against the US dollar from its current high point. Since China maintained a fixed peg against the dollar, the dollar had to fall more against other currencies like euro to make the necessary adjustment in America?s global trade balance.

 Indian goods will derive a competitive advantage over Chinese goods to the extent that the yuan appreciates against the rupee. However, a 2 per cent appreciation of yuan may not bring any significant change. Some analysts believe that China enjoys a cost advantage of 10-15 per cent over Indian textiles. On the other hand, export of Indian services like software to the US market would be more expensive if the US dollar falls in comparison to the rupee.

 The Chinese are not a major competitor in India. So a cheapening of Indian services in relation to the Chinese may not bring any advantage to India. To what extent the Indian rupee will now appreciate against the US dollar and other major currencies would hinge on whether the Reserve Bank of India will go on buying dollars from the market to prevent the rupee from appreciating.

 If the yuan appreciates significantly against the dollar, then most other Asian currencies, including the rupee, will probably be allowed by the respective central banks to appreciate to some extent against the dollar but depreciate against the yuan. If so, then imported goods (like oil) would be cheaper in India, helping the government reduce the inflation rate. It would also lessen the pressure to adjust the interest rate upward to keep pace with inflation. 

 Again, a lot would depend on what other Asian competitors do. In other words, the rest of Asia will enjoy a cost advantage over Chinese goods. But that does not necessarily mean that India will be able to increase its market share over others. The supply constraints, infrastructural bottlenecks, credit terms, brand image, the exchange rate policy of other Asian countries and many such factors will determine how far India will be able to make use of the emerging opportunities.

 If foreign investors believe that the yuan will appreciate significantly against the rupee in the near future, then more foreign direct investment may flow into India for two reasons. One, they will get a higher amount of domestic currency by investing a given amount of dollars in India, rather than in China. Second, to the extent that the FDI goes into export industries, exports from China (compared to those from India) will be more expensive.

 What will happen in the longer run, assuming that it is the beginning of a creeping upward journey of the Chinese yuan? At this moment, Walmart sources some $18 billion goods from China while its purchase from India is about $2 billion. So, if Indian goods get a significant price advantage, big global buyers like Walmart and Gap may source more from India and less from China. In fact, big buyers like Walmart are already a bit apprehensive about keeping almost all their eggs in the Chinese basket.

 So, they would be happy to diversify their purchases from different sources. Basically, Indian exports ? relative to Chinese goods ? will be cheaper abroad. If Indian exports are not limited by other constraints, then cheapening of goods should increase India?s sales in global markets. Of course, the relative advantage for Indian producers will be less if they import their inputs from China, which would be more expensive in rupees. Over time, this may provide an incentive to Indian manufacturers to source materials from countries other than China.

 Finally, what is going to happen to the US, which is maintaining its artificially high standard of living by borrowing cheaply from countries like China, which are investing their massive balance of payments surplus in US government bonds at a low interest rate? If that policy is reversed by China, the goods imported by the US from China (which constitute a large part of an average American?s consumption basket) will be more expensive as the dollar falls in comparison with the yuan. This would reduce American real income. Moreover, interest rates will rise in the US as the flow of cheap funds slows down. Thus, US consumers will suffer from both higher prices and worsened credit terms. US manufacturing industries may be able to sell more of their cheaper goods but the real estate boom, built on a low interest rate, will end.

 Countries like China, which has held a substantial portion of their massive foreign exchange reserves in US dollar, will suffer a large decline in the value of their reserves in terms of other currencies and real goods. That is loss of wealth for China. Moreover, if the growth rate in China slows down, it would depress the global demand for goods, which in turn may hurt growth in the rest of the world. Apart from that, another big question mark looms over the horizon. What will eventually happen to the stature of the US as the number one economic and political superpower when China takes away America?s credit card?

 Letters to Editor

 Idle worship

 Sir ? The unceremonious ouster of Sourav Ganguly from the captaincy of the Indian cricket team in one-dayers is astounding (?It?s that sinking feeling?, Oct 14). The decision is even more difficult to understand, if what the board secretary, S.K. Nair, said ? that Sourav?s lack of fitness had nothing to do with it ? is true. And this, after Sourav, India?s most successful one-day captain, had led the Indian team to victory against Zimbabwe. It is obvious that results do not matter and that off-field controversies have resulted in this decision. The selectors have been bowled over by Greg Chappell?s vision (though we have seen little of it) and his stature as a batsman. Chappell?s coaching record is dismal and there is no guarantee that a good player can be a good coach ? in fact most successful cricket coaches have been little-known players. I wonder what will happen if Chappell fails in his job, and India fails to win at home against Sri Lanka and South Africa. 

 Yours faithfully,

Indrajit Sardar, Calcutta

 Sir ? Sourav Ganguly should announce his retirement from cricket without any further delay, only then can he salvage some goodwill and respect. It is clear that the first round of the Chappell-Ganguly fracas has been won by Greg Chappell, although this does not take away from the boldness of the selection committee?s decision. Now the coach can work freely to build a strong team for the 2007 World Cup. Hopefully, we will see an end to the divisions among players.

 Yours faithfully, 

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

 Sir ?Sourav Ganguly?s exit was expected ? his poor batting form and overconfidence led to his downfall. Rahul Dravid being made captain of the Indian team is a victory for Greg Chappell. But it is also sad that Sourav forgot that a cricketer?s popularity depends upon his performance not on his earnings or modelling. He should have resigned as captain after his first-round victory over Chappell. Ganguly should now tend to his tennis elbow, and try to do well in the Duleep Trophy matches, so that he may rejoin the team. Cricket lovers in India can only hope that Dravid is able to prove his worth as captain and as batsman. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad

 Sir ? Never in the history of cricket has a captain been sacked immediately after he has returned victorious from an overseas series and that too after scoring a test century. The selectors obviously felt it didn?t amount to much because it was against Zimbabwe. Some time ago, when Mathew Hayden broke the world record by scoring 380 runs against Zimbabwe, I did not hear anyone in the world, the Indian selectors included, belittle Hayden. So much for double standards. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Debabrata Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? Words cannot be harsh enough to condemn the front-page graphic of the October 14 edition (captioned, ?Idol will return, Icon??), which had Sourav Ganguly?s face super-imposed on a sinking Durga idol. What was the message being sought to be conveyed? Is Sourav being equated with a deity? Or is this an attempt to sabotage whatever goodwill Rahul Dravid?s captaincy may have, before it even begins?

 Yours faithfully,

Biswapriya Purkayastha, Shillong

 Sir ? Sourav Ganguly has been replaced as the captain of the Indian cricket team, but that does not mean an end to his cricketing career or his life. The pictures obviously tried to evoke the ?sinking feeling? that the adjacent report referred to, but it was overdone. This is a sensitive issue, especially since the graphic, appearing on visarjan day, seemed to belittle the sentimental value of the immersion. Hopefully, Sourav will return and prove to the world that he is not finished yet.

 Yours faithfully,

Anindita Chatterjee, Calcutta

 Sir ?The computer-generated image of Sourav Ganguly sinking alongside Durga brought to mind a Victorian skimmity-ride, made famous in Hardy?s The Mayor of Casterbridge. Cleverness has boomeranged in this case. 

 Yours faithfully,

Moutusi Maity, Milwaukee, US

 Sir ? What pains Sourav?s fans is that their icon preferred an unceremonious bisarjan to a glorious sanyas.

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir ?The image is in very bad taste and is an affront not only to Sourav Ganguly but also millions of his admirers. 

 Yours faithfully,

Dipak Chakraborty, Subrata Kar and 15 others, Calcutta

 Sir ? Without meaning offence to Sourav Ganguly, I must congratulate The Telegraph for the images, which display a rare blend of tradition and pathos.

 Yours faithfully, 

Basudeb Bhattacharya, Calcutta

 Sir ? Reams of newsprint could not have expressed what has been depicted through the pictures on the front page on October 14. 

 Yours faithfully,

S.M. Roy, Calcutta

 Sir ? The Telegraph would have done better to publish a photograph of Ganguly and Rahul Dravid, with the caption, ?Old order changeth?. Ganguly is India?s most successful captain, even if he is currently out of form. Certainly he did not deserve a ?watery grave?. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

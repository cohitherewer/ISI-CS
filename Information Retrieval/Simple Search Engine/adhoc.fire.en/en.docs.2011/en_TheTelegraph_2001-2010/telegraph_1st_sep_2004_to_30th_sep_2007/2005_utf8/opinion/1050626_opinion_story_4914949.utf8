 CLIO AND THE STATE

 The relationship between the state and the writing of history has always been difficult and fraught with contradictions. On the one hand, as Hegel noted, the state has been the central focus of historical narratives. On the other, whenever the state has got itself involved in the writing of history, the consequences have been ominous. Think of the way the Soviet state under Josef Stalin manipulated the history of the Russian Revolution to suit its own political ends. Similarly, the Nazi state in Germany grossly distorted the German past to prepare the ground for the Final Solution. Many other examples of similar state-sponsored distortions can be cited. But in India, there is a steadfast refusal to draw the appropriate lessons from these past experiments of the state?s dabbling in history-writing. There exists in India a body called the Indian Council for Historical Research which successive governments choose to pack with historians it wants to patronize. This was started in the early Seventies when S. Nurul Hasan was the education minister and, since then, has become a practice followed by all governments irrespective of their ideological persuasion. This has made the ICHR a state-sponsored organization and not a body of professional historians taking independent decisions on their subjects and specialization. 

 The Indian state also directly involves itself in celebrating the anniversaries of historical events. The latest example is the decision, announced by the Union culture minister, Mr S. Jaipal Reddy, to set aside Rs 100 crore to celebrate 150 years of the revolt of 1857. The decision is difficult to justify except on the grounds of precedence. To mark the centenary of 1857, the then education minister, Abul Kalam Azad, had sponsored a volume on 1857 by the historian S.N. Sen. The volume bears all the signs of a solid empirical historian straining to fit his facts into the straitjacket of an authorized version of the uprising. It is difficult to imagine what the vast amount of money will be spent on. Another book, perhaps; exhibitions, seminars and so on. But why should the state spend on all this? If 1857, or any other historical event, deserves to be celebrated or written about, the matter should be decided upon by historians and definitely not by the state.

 The dangers inherent in a state-sponsored celebration of 1857 are evident. Such a celebration will inevitably attempt to appropriate the uprising into a particular ideological grid. This will hinder analysis and understanding, rather than enrich them. It will erase those aspects of the uprising with which the Indian state (or the political party running the state) is uncomfortable. The attempt made in 1957 to write a government-sponsored history of the uprising is illuminating. It started a meaningless controversy about nomenclature: mutiny, feudal uprising or war of independence? There was also the attempt to liberate those who were assumed to be freedom-fighters ? Nana Sahib, Tantia Topi and so on ? from the guilt of shedding the blood of innocent Britons. The project of writing an official history was not entirely satisfactory.

 The writing of the history of the 1857 rebellion should be left to professional historians who can negotiate with publishers to have their volumes published in 2007. The state should leave Clio alone.

 Letters to Editor

 Rules of friendship

 Sir ? While taking up the cause of Iran, Ashok Mitra makes no mention of the fact that the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, has publicly called for the destruction of Israel (?The moving finger?, October 31). India has been criticized for voting against Iran in the International Atomic Energy Agency meet, though it is well established that Iran, a signatory to the non-proliferation treaty, has violated the terms of the treaty in every conceivable way. Ahmadinejad?s comment had seriously shaken Moscow?s resolve to protect Iran in case of a possible referral to the security council, where Russia has a permanent, veto-wielding seat. The three main issues with Iran are ? hoodwinking NPT and pursuing development of weapons of mass destruction, stated aim of destroying Israel and the US, and support of terrorist outfits like Hezbollah and al Qaida. India?s role in November?s upcoming vote in IAEA is of utmost importance. For India must show that domestic politics and short-term goals like oil and vote bank should be secondary to defeating states proliferating WMD and sponsoring terrorism. There should be a uniform policy for Pakistan and Iran. 

 Yours faithfully,

Subhasis Paul, Calcutta

 Sir ? Ashok Mitra makes his analysis a laughing stock by juxtaposing race relations in America with the relative clout of the Pentagon vis-?-vis the state department in the US administration. What evidence does he have to prove that Condoleezza Rice and Colin Powell have lost much of their powers with the installation of Karl Rove, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld et al? Second, it is all very well to believe that Tehran is trying to develop ?civilian nuclear power?. Why, then, does it refuse to open up its installations to IAEA inspectors? Moreover, the recent call by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to ?wipe Israel off the map? certainly doesn?t portray a humane face of the regime. His extremism has been opposed within the Arab world, including Palestine. Third, if the Americans are making the mistake of treating the Middle East as one homogeneous entity, so is Mitra. There is no universal pan-Arabic plight to Western imperialism. Such attempts have consistently failed in the past, as states have recognized that their interest lies separate. The big picture is still hazy. Only time can tell, not Mitra.

 Yours faithfully,

Aruni Mukherjee, Coventry, UK

 Sir ? Ashok Mitra?s fears are not unfounded. History has shown that the US can go to any length to nail its target. After Afghanistan and Iraq, it is now Iran?s turn to be a soft target of the US. I would like to quote here what the unfortunate former Iraqi president, Saddam Hussein, once told our former prime minister, I.K. Gujral, ?The British looted you because you were rich in cotton, and the Americans are looting us because we are rich in oil?.

 Sadly, India?s vote at the IAEA is seen as India dancing to the tune of the US and stabbing Iran at the back. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Those who have read K.P. Nayar should not be surprised that he tries to pre-empt the blame game that will begin when the Indo-American nuclear deal collapses, by blaming Somnath Chatterjee (?Farce forward?, Nov 2). The nuclear deal was always one between George W. Bush and Manmohan Singh, not between the US and India. It is the old story of Indians fawning over those in power in the hope of being thrown a few crumbs. Thus, no one thought of the possibility that Bush might resile from his promises when he found himself under pressure. Besides, having got what he wanted ? the Indian vote against Iran in the IAEA ? he has no incentive to deliver on his promise. Instead, one can expect more arm-twisting to force India to buy F16s, send troops to Iraq, and participate in the upcoming invasion of Iran. And expect the Indian government to kowtow there too. So far as Nayar?s comments about the ?diplomatic high table? goes, one should remember that the same arguments were trotted out when India was under pressure to send troops to Iraq by Nayar and his ideological ilk. They fell abruptly silent when the scale of the Iraqi disaster became apparent, but have raised their heads again now that another opportunity of compradorship presents itself.

 Yours faithfully,

Biswapriya Purkayastha, Shillong 

 Sir ? Pratap Bhanu Mehta tries his best to reveal ?The truth about Iran? (Oct 25). However, his arguments reflect the age-old Indian policy of appeasing Muslim Middle Eastern nations in order to buy peace from the minority community at home. Saying that Iran is constantly pushed by the West is like stating that reaction is the cause of action. Iran repeatedly threatens global peace by exporting extremism through groups like the Hezbollah. During India?s stand-off with Pakistan, Iran was not of much help either. In the situation of a big conflict with Pakistan, Iran will surely support Pakistan, since the Quran proscribes Muslims to support non-Muslims in a fight against Muslims. 

 Yours faithfully,

Ramesh Dewan, Chennai

 Sir ? The Indian media has been harping on Iran?s friendly gesture in stalling the tabling of the Kashmir issue at the UN security council during P.V. Narasimha Rao?s tenure. It is felt that we should have reciprocated it by refusing to go along with the US policy of ?coercing? Iran to de-nuclearize. But it is difficult to ignore the Iranian president when he urges 4,000 students to wipe off Israel from the face of the world map. Yes, the US too has undermined nationalistic ambitions of many countries. On top of this was the constant US fear of communism taking over central Asia, which has now been replaced by a morbid fear of terrorism. However, no US action or threat can justify the hostile rhetoric aimed at Israel. 

 Yours faithfully,

Susenjit Guha, Calcutta

 Sir ? After Iraq, now it is Iran that is being targeted for attack by the US and its Nato allies. Israel is a nuclear power and a weapons merchant. But it is also the US?s pet. Israel has been viewed by Iran as a serious threat to it. The West is bent upon attacking Iran for their own petty economic interests. Would the US and other nuclear powers make a bonfire of their nuclear arsenals before calling upon the others to stop nuclear enrichment programmes. After all nuclear weapons are destroyed, let the IAEA take action against the erring nations. Else, nobody has the right to stop anyone else from gathering nuclear power. Every nation has the right to arrange its own security, especially after the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. 

 Yours faithfully,

Abdul R. Colachal, New Delhi

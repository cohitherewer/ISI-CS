 Letters to Editor

 Too good to be true

 Sir ? The editorial, ?Cadre-taming? (June 21), was full of praise for Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee for the police action on the civic poll day at Salt Lake. Are readers so na?ve as not to realize that this was a stage-managed diversionary tactic? Is it possible that the CPI(M) suddenly developed a heart of gold, and did not want to rely on muscle power to win votes? Why wasn?t similar action taken in other areas where, too, shameless use of cadre-power was on display? And if the administration really ensured free and fair polls, how is it that the CPI(M), which trailed in 16 wards in the Lok Sabha polls held a year back, has won in 18 this time?

 Yours faithfully,

Anjan Ghosh, Calcutta

 What goes up

 Sir ? The editorial, ?Riding on oil? (June 22), says that ?petrol and diesel should reflect global oil prices? and that ?diesel and petrol continue to be subsidized by government?. This is not true. The landing cost of petrol is far less than what the consumer pays for it. The addition of customs, excise and sales tax drives up the price. It is a misleading claim by the government that petrol and diesel prices are subsidized. Sadly, even the media which is well-informed in most matters have fallen for it.

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? Oil prices are soaring and will continue to do so with crude touching $ 60 per barrel. Besides foreign exchange outflows straining the country?s balance of payments, higher crude prices mean greater hardship on consumers and the transport industry. One way out is to introduce electricity-powered light automobiles and trains. Power plants not dependent on oil can supply energy through batteries and an overhead traction system. Sadly, there is only one manufacturer of such vehicles. The government too does not seem to have a blueprint in this regard. Such battery-powered cars are not only cheaper, they also help reduce pollution. Depleting oil reserves, rising demand and high prices make this the only viable solution for the future.

 Yours faithfully,

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? In the Seventies, I had a two-wheeler. Five litres of petrol then cost me Rs 30 and, at an average mileage of 30 km per litre, I could travel about 150 km on it. Now I have a car. Five litres now cost about Rs 210. And since the car gives a mileage of 10 km per litre, I can travel 50 km only. Thus, Rs 30 took one much farther thirty years ago than Rs 210 does today. Petrol prices have gone up about seven times but not the earnings of the people. The moral of the story ? travel less to save costs and fuel. It would have the added benefit of solving our parking problems.

 Yours faithfully,

M. Kumar, New Delhi

 Sir ? The latest oil price hike comes more than six months after the last one, and is quite reasonable. It will not affect the economy much. People will have to pay a higher price for petrol as a result of the hike, but many have been paying more for branded stuff, which is marketed as being ?better?. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shiv Shanker Almal, Calcutta

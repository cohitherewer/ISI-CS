 LAW OF THE WILD

 Sometimes it is not enough to say that the law and order situation is a bit awry. When the lawless gains full ascendancy over the law-abiding, the situation must be assessed in terms of a complete inversion of law and order. The insecurity that women in India feel today can be understood in these terms alone. Ms Shakuntala Verma was doing her job as supervisor in the child and welfare department in Madhya Pradesh. Following up a complaint from the village of Bhanpur in tribal-dominated Dhar, that a child marriage was going to be held, Ms Verma tried to dissuade the people there from marrying off their children. This was particularly urgent, as it was a few days before Akshay Tritiya, when thousands of child marriages take place. The matter did not end with the hostility she faced in the village. Within a few days she was attacked and her hands chopped off. Far away from the region where this hideous revenge was executed, in Sonarpur, close to Calcutta, a young woman slapped a man who had been following her on the road with ugly comments. The man collected 20 of his friends, and they burst into her home, dragged her out and beat her up, forced her to apologize and, as a parting message, tore off her clothes. A crowd stood and watched. 

 But this is to go halfway through the stories. The response of the administration in each case is far more interesting than the acts of violence. The evasiveness, indifference and pusillanimity shown by the officials associated with each case contain the real clue to the reversal of law and order that these incidents exemplify. In Ms Verma?s case, the chief minister, Mr Babulal Gaur, suggested that the ?incident? had nothing to do with the victim?s campaign against child marriage, but was the result of a love affair or a ?private matter?. Without the vocal intervention of the National Women?s Commission and women politicians, Ms Verma?s case might have vanished without a ripple. Now Mr Gaur is claiming he finds it is ?impossible? to stop child marriages, just as Gandhi could not ?stop? untouchability. It is not surprising that 50,000 child marriages took place in the state after Ms Verma?s hands had been cut off. Meanwhile, in Sonarpur, no policeman responded to the battered woman?s call. Only when a local politician took her with him to the police station was a first information report taken. The moral of the stories is the same, and equally bleak.

 HUNGRY AND IN DISTRESS 

 Gwynne Dyer

 Like the late Palestinian leader,Yasser Arafat, and Cuba?s Fidel Castro, President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe is a revolutionary who would have served his people best by dying a long time ago. Instead, at the age of 81, he is now deliberately starving people who refused to vote for his Zanu-PF party in the elections on March 31. Perhaps no one individual can claim the credit for ruining a whole country, but Mugabe would certainly lead the contenders.

 When Mugabe became president a quarter-century ago, after a long guerilla war led by Zanu-PF had finally overthrown the white minority regime, he inherited a country with a decent infrastructure and rich agricultural resources. 

 Zimbabwe did fairly well despite Mugabe. It was impossible to defend the fact that white farmers owned most of the good land in the country, but they did grow enough to feed everybody with plenty left over for export. A property-owning and even factory-owning black middle class appeared in the cities, though too many of them owed their prosperity to their political connections. 

 Old tricks

 I went back to Zimbabwe in 1995 for the first time since the end of the liberation war, and the contrast with South Africa was stunning. It was only one year since the end of the apartheid regime in South Africa, and I had just come from the rural northern Transvaal, hardly the richest part of the country ? but across the river, in Zimbabwe, was a different world. Nobody was starving and most of the kids were getting at least a few years of school, but despite a 15-year head-start on South Africa as a post-colonial, non-racist society, Zimbabwe?s black majority were hugely poorer than their counterparts in South Africa.

 Then, in order to secure Zanu-PF?s hold on power forever, Mugabe held a referendum in 1999 to change the constitution and turn Zimbabwe into a one-party state. That gave everybody an opportunity to say no, so they said it loud and clear, and Mugabe has been running scared ever since. He?s a bit old to learn new tricks, so that mainly means confronting the local whites, blaming everything that goes wrong on the ?colonialists? and ?imperialists?, and beating up, jailing, starving or killing those Zimbabweans who defy Zanu-PF.

 In a mess

 The land reform that should have begun 20 years ago, with compensation for white farmers who were gradually bought out and training and financial assistance for black farmers who were given a piece of the huge farms, was done by violence, without compensation, in less than 2 years. Huge amounts of land have simply fallen out of production, so production of maize, the staple food crop, has fallen by almost half. Not only are there no exports to bring in foreign exchange; one-quarter of Zimbabweans are slowly starving.

 Last year, Mugabe stopped international aid organizations from distributing food in Zimbabwe. He probably did it more out of pride than malice, but the effect has been to make everybody in famine-stricken areas totally reliant on buying food from the government-controlled Grain Marketing Board. And in many areas where support for the opposition was strong, the GMB only sold food to Zanu-PF members.

 If you fall afoul of Zanu-PF in today?s Zimbabwe, do not expect the police or the courts to help you. And don?t expect parliament to help you, either: well over half of Zimbabweans would have probably voted against Mugabe and his cronies in a genuinely free election, but an estimated two-thirds of the electorate have taken the safer course and cast their ballots for Zanu-PF candidates in the election. And so it will go until Mugabe is removed either by death or by his own colleagues. Zimbabwe would probably be a lot happier place if he had died in, say, 1981.

 READY, STEADY, GO

 Greater corporate interest in sporting activities other than cricket will do a world of good to Indian sports, writes Sumanta Sen

 Helping hand

 A welcome piece of news on the sports pages recently was that Zee Sports would telecast football matches in the country in a big way and would pay the All India Football Federation around Rs 270 crore for this. The news was welcome not because of any expectations that Indian football would recover and come within the first 100 in Fifa rankings. For a team that lost to minnows Pakistan and Fiji in the last one month, that would be a big task indeed. No, the news was welcome for this is yet another sign of the corporate world showing interest in areas of sporting activity other than cricket. And that can be expected to help in the long run.

 This was long overdue. For far too long has cricket hogged the entire attention of the money-bags. A couple of companies sponsoring a handful of football clubs was not quite what Indian soccer needed. Now if the corporate world as a whole comes to the aid of the game, then the AIFF bosses will be forced to sit up as the backers will naturally demand a return for their money. And if the same thing happens in the case of hockey and athletics, then the authorities concerned will also be expected to follow suit. This may sound like wishful thinking but then lack of funds has always been one of the main excuses for our poor performance in sports. If that problem is taken care of, why can?t one dream of a better future?

 The news from the football front should also make the Board of Control for Cricket in India think of whether it can afford to function the way it is doing at present. The squabbling, both inside the boardroom and law courts, is all because of one thing ? an abundance of funds. The BCCI is one of the richest companies, if one may say so, in the country and naturally the Dalmiyas, the Pawars, the Dungarpurs and the Bindras want to have not just their fingers, but also their fists in the pie. They all swear by ?cricket?, but if sponsors decide to turn in other directions where will they be? There is a theory that less funds will make both the board and the players sit up and then cricket will be the gainer. If that theory is to be given a chance then there is all the more reason for the corporate world to spend in other areas.

 Corporatization of the game has brought plenty to the players, or certainly to the regulars on the national side. But what about performance, which, even at the last so-called review meeting, was so piously held up as the only criterion? India won the World Cup in 1983 but what trophy has the team brought home since then? Of the last 19 ODI finals, it lost 18. The jinx of not winning a test series abroad (outside the subcontinent) could be broken only after a victory against Zimbabwe, which is under the threat of losing its status as a test-playing country.

 Ironically, the more India lost, the more the frenzy, and the more funds flowed. It is common these days to see a player getting out cheaply and yet sponsor a suit length, an insurance company or a car tyre in the commercial break. This irony is explained by the backers with the claim that cricket is a ?religion? in India, and the people did not really mind how the gods went about their job. Mercifully, now the backers are showing signs of looking for other ?gods?.

 And the corporate world should not have much of a problem with public interest. In Calcutta, for instance, as also, perhaps, in places like Kerala, Goa or Manipur, cricket has never been able to eat into the craze for football. Similarly, in north India hockey remains as popular as before. It has to be admitted that in the international arena, Indian hockey has taken a beating but then, it is not too late to try and make a new beginning. And corporate funding may well help build up the infrastructure for that.

 The other area is athletics. From the days of Milkha Singh and P.T. Usha to Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore and Anju Bobby George, individual achievements have come India?s way, but consistency has been missing and performance at a lower level has not been matched at a higher level. Athletes complain of lack of training facilities, and here also the corporate world can provide succour. After all, it is the showing in athletics that largely determines the status of a country as a sporting nation. Yes, right now cricket is more glamourous but that glamour has, to a large extent, been created by forces outside the field. Also, one must remember that the former British colonies which constitute the cricket-playing world are of little consequence today. A Sachin Tendulkar or a Rahul Dravid can go unnoticed in an European country or in America, but can the same be said of an Olympic gold winner even if he, say, comes from a small African country?

 There is another angle. It is often said that Indian athletes with great timings at home fall flat the moment they step into the arena at an international meet because their timings are ?cooked up?. If the allegation is true, then this is because nobody has kept an eye on the officials concerned. But if a company, or a consortium of companies, were to do the funding then they would certainly ensure that their investment does not go wrong because somebody has been fudging the figures.

 Thus mere funding is not enough, a strict eye must be kept on other things. For instance, why should politicians be allowed to head sports bodies when they themselves may have never played the game at any serious level? Or why should retired government officers wield the power of distributing favours? There is no dearth of competent former players in almost every discipline, and the sponsors of tomorrow would do well to insist that they be involved in a meaningful way. There has to be a change from the present system where former players are under the thumb of non-players just because they head the body concerned. When one talks of former players, one has those in mind who have represented the country in their own right and not by the courtesy of others who remain in the background.

 This brings one back to cricket. The BCCI associates former players only with the task of coaching (not at the national level right now), but the job of administration is not open to them, presumably, because it is too difficult to handle. Can it be anybody?s contention that men like Sunil Gavaskar or Ajit Wadekar or Kapil Dev do not know how to handle finance? Indeed, the ugly wrangling that was witnessed recently does seem to strengthen the case for a thorough overhaul of the system and the ushering in of one in which former players with proven credentials would play a role. How about the present sponsors of the game insisting on this?

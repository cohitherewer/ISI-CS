 COLOUR NO BAR

 Raju mukherji

 Apartheid and Africa are close cousins. South Africa had avoided competing against the ?coloured? nations ever since they began to play international cricket in 1888. They would play England, Australia and New Zealand but not the West Indies, India or Pakistan. This despicable approach was tolerated by the white-dominated International Cricket Council for more than 100 years.

 Ironically, while the South African cricket authorities chose not to play against ?coloured? teams, they had no qualms about playing against ?coloured? players! During their 1929 tour of England, the Sussex cricketer of Indian origin, Duleepsinhji, played against the Proteas for England in test matches. Thus, the policy of apartheid was full of loopholes.

 However, in 1968, there was a sudden departure from the customary practice. This time, the South African authorities objected to the presence of Basil D?Oliveira, a ?coloured? cricketer in the England team. A former cricketer from South Africa, D?Oliveira had settled down in England, represented Worcestershire, and was a deserving candidate for the England test side. When he was selected for the tour of South Africa in 1968-69, the prime minister of South Africa, B.J. Vorster, informed England that the English team would not be welcome in South Africa! This led to South Africa?s banishment from international cricket.

 Only whites, please

 Why is it that South Africa did not object to Duleepsinhji earlier but vehemently refused to allow D?Oliveira to play in the Sixties? This was because of the shift in international politics in the post-World War II period. Before the advent of the Nationalist Party, the official advocate of the apartheid system, governments in South Africa, while practising apartheid, were not unduly concerned with other countries. They did advocate racial segregation but they did not have an official policy.

 Another reason for the liberal attitude was that England in the pre-war era was a premier political power with a wide reach. The South African government, therefore, did not wish to offend the ?mother country? in any manner.

 By the Sixties, this equation had changed drastically. England had lost its imperial status. The colonies had started gaining independence and were not averse to taking steps antagonistic to England?s interests. Under these circumstances, the Nationalist Party announced its policy of apartheid. Unfortunately, neither the United Nations nor the major powers could do anything to stop the practice of apartheid. Only a few economic sanctions were announced. The ICC, too, did not exert any strictures. This lack of initiative on the part of the international community further emboldened the advocates of apartheid in South Africa.

 Welcome back

 When the white-dominated South African government refused to allow the coloured English cricketer, Basil D?Oliveira, on its soil, it proved to be the proverbial last straw. Within a year, South Africa was banned by the ICC from participating in international cricket matches.

 The next two decades saw a change in South Africa?s socio-political scenario. The fall of the Nationalist Party and subsequently, Nelson Mandela?s able leadership, helped the country to get back to civilized ways of existence. ?Coloured? cricketers like Makhaya Ntini are getting the recognition that was denied to their cricketing forefathers. The evil days that clouded DOliveira?s cricket career are over.

 The match against the Proteas at Calcutta on Friday would herald the silver jubilee anniversary of South Africa?s return to cricket. Ironically, it was ?coloured? Calcutta which helped South African players find their feet again exactly 25 years ago.

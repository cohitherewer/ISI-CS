 WHAT AN UNHAPPY BUNCH

 MALVIKA SINGH

 Once again, as the UPA celebrates its first anniversary in the treasury benches and as the rulers of India, the CPI(M) are predictably sullen. This is so utterly unappealing. Even the poorest of the poor, who have suffered in the hands of all the many political dispensations, smile every now and then. But alas, members of the CPI(M) politburo and the executives of the party are forever scowling, complaining, whining and feeling persecuted, as they wallow in a time warp. Why can they not discuss, debate, argue, coalesce in committee and be normal human beings at dinner?

 Why do they shun celebration? Why are they so one dimensional, so robot-like? What did they expect in one year when in scores of years they have not been able to deliver all in one state? They paint a truly sad picture of themselves. There has not been a single positive statement by any of them that can be recalled with ease. A negativism seems to have overwhelmed them. They come across as an unhappy bunch of people, with no fresh and crisp thinking that a new generation could identify with. They appear stuck in an aged and rusty paradigm.

 What the UPA has been unable to address is the rampant corruption in all government offices and operations. No alliance partners, including the CPI(M), have been actively demanding the forceful initiation of the ?clean-up?. Is it because those who are exalted and privileged survive better in the present state? What affects rich and poor alike, in India, is corruption. Ironically, corruption is the great leveller here. It brings all the disparate classes together under its canopy. It is the most efficient and successful machine in this country as it brings one and all into its cauldron. Its infrastructure is perfect, it adjusts easily to all economic strata, it functions without a glitch, it appears more legitimate than what the dictionary definition is of legitimate, and anyone who fights corruption in India gets tied up in legal nightmares, while those who work within the corrupt alternative, live comfortable, stress-free lives.

 Corrupt to the core

 When will this injection of poison into the soul of India explode? When will the crooks and those extortionists in authority, who shamelessly exploit their honest fellow humans, be brought to book? Honesty and truth are today dirty words of abuse in this great and ancient country. Bharat has been insulted and demeaned by those who have administered us for decades. They have behaved as appallingly as our erstwhile colonial ?masters?. No difference.

 The CPI(M) should make ?corruption cleansing? their top priority and threaten to drop the government if immediate action is not taken and radical changes not brought into play particularly in the service sector of roti, kapda, and makaan. That one demand will make them the heroes of all citizens of all classes and castes, not just their small, remaining cadre. Transparency of the municipalities, electricity departments, police ? these are the areas where honesty needs to prevail. How about making ?legitimacy? as important an issue as FDI?

 If this UPA government does not immediately address and redress the horrors of functioning infused with corruption, the edifice will crumble. Because the civilian attack on the bureaucracy has become ?regular? and unabated, this conglomerate of administrators at large seem to have closed ranks. The condition of our towns and cities, our broken down electricity departments with their loose wires overhead, our choked drains and much, much more, epitomizes and symbolizes the babudom of India. Every living administrator should feel deeply ashamed of what he has reduced us to. The dignity of life and living has been snatched from all of us as we are compelled to live by corrupt practices and corrupted realities.

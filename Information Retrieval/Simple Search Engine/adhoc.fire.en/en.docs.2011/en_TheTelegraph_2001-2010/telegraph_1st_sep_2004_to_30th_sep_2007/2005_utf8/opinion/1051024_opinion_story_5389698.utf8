 RIGHT POST

 Controversies tend to obfuscate fundamental issues. The decision of Mr N.R. Narayana Murthy to quit the Bangalore International Airport project was provoked by a comment by the former prime minister, Mr H.D. Deve Gowda. The latter questioned the unusually long time it was taking for the project to take off and suggested that Mr Narayana Murthy, who is the chairman of the project, should be held accountable. Mr Narayana Murthy took offence at the comment and resigned. Damage control measures have been put into operation by the chief minister of Karnataka, Mr Dharam Singh, and pressure is being mounted on Mr Narayana Murthy to reconsider his resignation. This storm over an airport has deflected attention from the main question that should be asked: what is Mr Narayana Murthy doing, in the first place, as the chairman of the Bangalore International Airport project? He is without doubt one of the two most distinguished names in the world of information technology in India. As an entrepreneur in his chosen field, he has earned recognition and respect across the globe. And rightly so. But this does not make him an expert on the making of airports. He is also not an investor in the project, and neither is he a known expert in the field of civil aviation and transport. He was invited to be chairman of the project for his eminence in a field that has little to do with the building of an airport of international standards. Mr Narayana Murthy?s expertise will be essential for the functioning of a top class airport but not for its making.

 The appointment of Mr Narayana Murthy is an ornamental one. In India, there is a propensity to make such appointments. Distinguished people are asked to come on boards, to serve as directors and to be chairpersons even when their expertise has nothing to do with the project or the company under consideration. Such appointments may bring distinction to the board or the institution, but they seldom, if ever, add substance. There is no explanation for this tendency but for the fact that Indians tend to misconstrue the role of experts. An expert in one field may not necessarily be the best choice in another, even related, field. In this particular instance, Mr Narayana Murthy is being held responsible for the delay in a project of which he is not the driving force. He should ponder if it was wise to have accepted the position in the first place. A person of his eminence should have no need for ornamental appointments.

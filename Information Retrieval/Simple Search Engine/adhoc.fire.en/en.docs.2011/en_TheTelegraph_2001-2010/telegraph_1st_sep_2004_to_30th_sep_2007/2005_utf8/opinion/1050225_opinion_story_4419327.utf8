 WARM WINTER NIGHTS

 NEHA SAHAY

 If Mumbai is shivering, South China is freezing. Even heaters aren?t enough in Guangdong?s cities this winter, cities normally criticized as ?uncomfortably hot? by Northerners who flock to these special economic zones for jobs. This winter, you need special blankets and closed windows to get a comfortable night?s sleep. Temperature lows of seven degrees ensure everyone is in bed early ? unless you are one of those who can drive around in heated cars.

 The good part of China?s ?economic reform?? is that even if you are a not-at-all rich, but young and unmarried migrant worker ? at the bottom of the economic ladder, higher only than a peasant ? winter nights are not all that bad in these cities. Unless you are a construction worker who has not been paid for months. The main shopping streets are lit up till late at night. A good way to pass time is to lose yourself in them (they are all walking streets, closed to traffic all the time), shopping, rubbing shoulders with the trendy young Romeos and the fabulously attired young women strutting around in groups, biting into Chinese fast food being cooked on pavement stalls, one eye on the 50 yuan Vogue jacket they want to buy for 30 yuan, the other looking-out for the typically bedazzled expat male who they can practise their English on and hopefully befriend.

 Homeward bound 

 Most of these young people have left behind families in villages, and have no reason to hurry back to the cold dormitories provided by their employers when they can spend the night out with friends. If they get tired, open-air bars provide cheap cocktails (15 yuan gets you a fantastic Screwdriver); and karaoke bars and discos are invitingly warm and open all night. Many a young peasant-girl-turned-city-waitress, earning between 500 and 800 yuan, has lost her way in these streets, often too late to return to the straight and narrow. But that?s another story.

 Winters in the villages are, of course, different: cold stone or brick houses; small fires; the quiet sounds of old people and small children. The one thing to look forward to is the Chinese New Year at the end of winter, when most migrant workers move heaven and earth to come home ? the poorest have even walked home, deprived of wages, unable to pay the fares which are officially raised by 20 to 40 per cent to cash in on the travel rush.

 Class apart

 Railway stations and bus stands are not unlike our own when the seasonal exodus takes place, except some, like Shanghai?s just-opened bus terminal, the largest in Asia. But once the train arrives, fashionable baggages are all carried high above the head and thrown into compartments. Inside the compartment of course, the story?s the same: cigarette smoke, non-stop spitting, and the odours of sweat, woollens and home-cooked (non-vegetarian) food.

 All this is for the plebs. Few middle-class and wealthy Chinese travel by train at this time, unless it?s first class. Interestingly, communist China?s new train fare structure is so class-based that there are different fares for upper and lower berths!

 The preferred mode of travel for the upper crust is by air. During the New Year, they are not just homeward-bound, but increasingly, headed towards the once-forbidden destinations of Hong Kong and Macao, to partake of pleasures still unavailable on the mainland: shopping for genuine brands and gambling in casinos. This New Year, a new destination was added ? Taipei in Taiwan, linked, after 55 years, by direct flights to Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.

 Indians who think they are the new kids on the Western block should consider this: this year, European nations have employed Chinese staff to handle Chinese tourists celebrating their New Year abroad!

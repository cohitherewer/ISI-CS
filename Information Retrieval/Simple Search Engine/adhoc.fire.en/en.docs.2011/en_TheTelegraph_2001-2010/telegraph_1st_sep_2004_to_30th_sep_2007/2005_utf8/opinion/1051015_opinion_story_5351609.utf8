 Letters to Editor

 Cutting both ways

 Sir ? The chilli pepper spray has become such a huge hit in Indian cities that the report, ?Self-defence spray dons a new avatar? (Sept 21), should not come as a surprise. For women, especially those negotiating the dangers of city roads on their own, it is indeed very useful as a defensive weapon. But why has nobody ever thought that the spray may also come in handy for attackers who may use it to disable their victims? And if the attackers seriously start to use this spray on their victims, then it would be no longer useful for the victims.

 Yours faithfully,

 Zeeshan Roohullah, Calcutta

 IT and others 

 Sir ? First causing the injury and then applying a balm ? what is this bizarre drama that Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is enacting (?Bandh-battered Buddha calls IT firms for talks?, Oct 5)? But before being so bold as to speak his mind to the executives of information technology companies, has the chief minister sounded out his bosses in the politburo and Alimuddin Street? Also, why is Bhattacharjee always thinking only of the IT industries, which are confined, by and large, to Calcutta and employ only a few thousand. What about the large numbers employed in the unorganized sector?

 Are such strikes meant to scuttle Bhattacharjee?s economic reforms or is the left brigade simply flexing muscles? But it is quite pointless doing the latter. Given the state?s moribund opposition, the left is likely to stay put in Writers? Buildings for a long time. And if the cadre are trying to upset Bhattacharjee?s industrialization drive, they should know that the people have welcomed it. Witness the landslide victory of the Left Front candidate in the recent Asansol by-election.

 Yours faithfully,

Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

 Sir ? Anyone who is taken in by Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s spiel about how West Bengal is changing has only to look at the jute mills. Infested with trade unions, beset by frequent strikes, these mills remain closed for more days in a year than they are open. And with most of the close to three-lakh workers in these mills being daily wagers, the losses caused by even a one-day strike can be imagined. Given the circumstances, the project involving the Salim Group too does not look bright.

 Yours faithfully,

Sumant Poddar, Calcutta

 Sir ? Why is Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee so partial to IT? It is unfair to all the others who suffer equally as a result of strikes. What about the long-distance passengers who got stranded in trains or at airports/railway stations? Or the patients who died for want of transport? Actually, our chief minister is no better than the organizers of bandhs who are sympathetic to workers and think the rest of the society can go fend for itself. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.K. Das, Calcutta

 Sir ? The report, ?Industry plank gifts CPM a landslide? (Oct 5), says that the people of Asansol constituency heartily endorsed Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s policy on industrialization. True, the CPI(M)-led government has taken the lead in reviving and setting up many small and medium-scale units there. But there is another reason for the left victory ? the opening up of hundreds of illegal mines in the northern stretch of this constituency by the ruling Left Front, in collusion with the police. The locals on the stretch from Salanpur to Ukhra on the banks of the Ajoy who operate these illegal mines have been making a killing, supplying the sponge iron units in the area. 

 Yours faithfully,

Asutosh Chattopadhyay, Burdwan

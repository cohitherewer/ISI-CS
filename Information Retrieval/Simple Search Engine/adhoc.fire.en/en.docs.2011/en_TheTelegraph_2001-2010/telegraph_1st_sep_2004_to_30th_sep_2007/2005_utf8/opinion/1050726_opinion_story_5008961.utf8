 UMBRELLA MORALS 

 Calcutta?s tolerance towards courting 

 couples is exceptional. Other metros would rather obliterate 

 their presence, says Janaki Nair 

 Out of sight, out 

 of mind? 

 Among the more charming aspects 

 of life in Calcutta is the intimacy zone that springs up 

 at dusk around Vivekananda Park, where young couples snatch 

 anonymity and a few moments of togetherness. There is an 

 admirable indulgence, or at least tolerance, where such 

 displays of public affection are concerned, and many hawkers 

 even survive on these twilight trysts. It is admirable because 

 there is probably no other Indian metro where self-appointed 

 guardians of public morality have not yet rushed in to banish 

 heterosexual affection from the gaze of a public haunted 

 by memories of a purported ?ancient Indian culture? and 

 the spectre of ?loose Western womanhood?. In Bangalore?s 

 Cubbon Park, lathi-wielding policemen make sure that all 

 benches are lover-proof. Young boys in Delhi?s parks and 

 Kerala?s villages begin their policing duties early in life 

 by stoning couples who may be meeting even during the day.

 Couples who are just colleagues 

 returning from work are not spared in cities like Chennai, 

 and there are some metros, such as Chandigarh, where men 

 may even demand a piece of action from the man. Not so long 

 ago, a group of 100 morally diligent citizens in Hyderabad 

 formed the Federation of Culture Upgradation and Social 

 Services (Focuss) to check the depraved activities of young 

 people in public parks. They sought the help of the police 

 to root out such activity and protect young teenagers (read 

 girls) from being harassed by thugs and blackmailers.

 So it is surely with some dismay 

 that we read that Calcutta, so eager to embrace the ways 

 of India?s more economically successful cities, is making 

 preliminary efforts to control the use of the ubiquitous 

 umbrella ? another lovable Calcutta institution, often used 

 against dirty old men in parks. Dismay, since I can think 

 of no other metro where the female body is not routinely 

 violated or public life brutalized in the midst of the pressing 

 crowds, heat and the unavoidable closeness of life that 

 daily life entails in Calcutta. This is no mean cultural 

 achievement, and one that must be treasured and nurtured, 

 rather than uprooted from the public realm for another imagined 

 culture. (Of course, we must remember that this tolerance 

 and humaneness is a cultural achievement that has not emerged 

 out of a feminist movement, but springs from a more benign 

 patriarchy and a gentler masculinity.)

 Let us first of all remember that 

 all the extraordinary vigilance about protecting a vague 

 ?Indian public? from depravity is nothing but focused attention 

 on consensual sexual activity. It is the very consensuality 

 of these public affections that so deeply disturbs the guardians 

 and stirs them to action. After all, if the sight of necking 

 couples is offensive, surely the use of umbrellas should 

 be encouraged, not proscribed! But in most cases, patriarchal 

 control of the public space is aimed at penalizing the woman 

 who dares to publicly exhibit her desire.

 And what easier way than to impose 

 dress codes for women? Regional cultural nationalism has 

 long flourished by marking the body of the woman, whether 

 by insisting Bengali women must be draped in saris 

 rather than salwar kameezes, or that the chaste Tamil 

 woman must abandon the comfort and ease of the ?North Indian? 

 dress for the pavadai in Tamil Nadu. There can also 

 be the reverse chauvinism that insists that a ?national? 

 code of honour be imposed on the women of the Northeast 

 who study in Delhi, to protect them from potential rapists 

 and harassers. 

 This is why every expression of 

 rage or anger over the rape of women in metros, as happened 

 in Mumbai recently, or is happening in Kerala, is met with 

 proscriptions on consensual sexuality and on female desire 

 to restore to men what is rightfully theirs ? the streets 

 and other public spaces. It also restores to men the right 

 to harass women, often in the name of ?loving?, and as several 

 recent murders of young women in Andhra Pradesh have shown, 

 loving them to death. Some anthropologists in Kerala have 

 even detected a form of ?courtship? in the routine harassment 

 of women, almost echoing what popular cinema propagates.

 It is tiresome for feminists to 

 repeat that the reason for rape is never the so-called ?provocation? 

 of female clothing, for then we would have no way of explaining 

 the fates of Imrana or the hundreds of young children and 

 grandmothers who are raped by relatives, or the Mukhtaran 

 Mais of India, namely lower caste women. who are routinely 

 raped in the name of restoring caste honour. We would have 

 no way of explaining the gang-rapes on trains, in police 

 stations, and in guest houses frequented by politicians. 

 Both the Kerala and Mumbai dress codes for women that have 

 been recently announced are nothing if not attempts to dismantle 

 the more sexually active roles that women may be taking 

 on, as a result of feminism and perhaps also in response 

 to the widespread sexualization of the visual field.

 It was barely a century ago when 

 the erotic appeal of the upper caste Kerala woman was enhanced 

 by her wearing a blouse when the sartorial norm was the 

 bare bosom. Over the last century, a ?modest? covering of 

 the female body in Kerala has been achieved, but this has 

 done nothing to stem aggressive and violent masculinity 

 from asserting itself to make the state singularly unsafe 

 for women. Even the formless ?nightie? that has become a 

 staple of the working class women?s wardrobe, and parallels 

 the burqa in its concealments, is no guarantee against 

 harassment.

 The aggressive move to return 

 metropolitan women to dubious concealment and the even more 

 dubious safety of their homes ? easily the most dangerous 

 place for women in India ? is designed to restore male privileges 

 that are being shaken. As more and more women are being 

 invited to the workplace and to be independent consumers, 

 their new-found freedoms or independence will clash with 

 the beliefs of those who reassert a patriarchal family order. 

 Visitors to China have reported not only its determined 

 economic transformation but also its relative tolerance 

 of young couples: the city of Dalian welcomes visitors to 

 the City of Romance.

 These changes have, by no means, 

 come at a cheap price. In many parts of China, women are 

 still the target of national policies of family control. 

 Yet, China?s self-respect nowhere flaunts its links with 

 an equally ?ancient? culture as India?s. Neither does it 

 share the record of the sleazy trafficking in women that 

 is the hallmark of many of its neighbours.

 A cultural revolution that draws 

 on and makes a ?national popular? of Calcutta?s unique tolerance 

 of, and respect for, consensual sexualities ? as signified 

 by the courting couples of Vivekananda Park ? may not change 

 West Bengal?s GDP. But it will go a long way in showing 

 that there are cultural achievements in our present that 

 are worth protecting and even emulating.

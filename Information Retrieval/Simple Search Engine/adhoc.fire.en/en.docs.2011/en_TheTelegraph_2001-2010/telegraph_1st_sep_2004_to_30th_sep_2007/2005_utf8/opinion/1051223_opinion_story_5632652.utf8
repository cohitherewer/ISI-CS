 NATURAL GAME

 - Outstanding cricketer as Everyman

 Celebrating a ton, Sydney, 1992-93

 Out of My Comfort Zone By Steve Waugh, Viking, Rs 895

 When Steve Waugh played, which was not so long ago, his batting was hardly ever a dazzling arrangement of hooks and pulls. A classy Steve Waugh innings was meant to be savoured over time, and admired for its grit and doggedness. His autobiography has some of the qualities of his batsmanship. No other internet-age cricketer ? including the ghost-written ones ? would get away with writing an 800-page tome. Waugh has managed to make it a bestseller.

 Waugh?s greatest achievement as a writer is perhaps that he erases the distance between himself and his readers by making the life of an extraordinary cricketer appear no more exalted than Everyman?s. To a subcontinental readership, used to watching next-door cricketers pole-vault to new heights of material comfort the moment they make national grade, Waugh?s labours at building his own house a good four years after his test debut might be an eyeopener. Aspiring memoir-writers in the Indian team could take a few tips on candid speaking from Waugh, who not only lists his match-eve binges, but also the four-letter weapons fired at opposition batsmen. Young cricketers may gain from reading about his first television interview before his test debut (against India in 1985-86): ?All I could think of...was all those people on the other side of the camera lens who were staring at me, waiting for me to make a mistake. The red light was hypnotic; I was like a rabbit in the headlights, drawn in but unable to do anything about the outcome.?

 But it takes more than the red light to hypnotise Steve Waugh. Keeping the foot in the ground has never been a problem with him. The simplest illustration of this ? ignoring the hackneyed statements about familial bonding ? is his unbeaten partnership with Lynette, his high-school sweetheart. (Lynette Waugh?s account, ?My Life with Stephen?, as appendix enriches the book in more ways than one.) From the sense of groundedness also comes the ability to put things in perspective. These stand Waugh in good stead when he defends some umpiring decisions that went against his team. But the same quality takes a beating when he deals with the match-fixing issue or his own bungled catch off Brian Lara in Australia?s 1994-95 tour of the Caribbean.

 Talking about match-fixing has understandably been difficult for Waugh, given that his twin, Mark, was among the accused. But surely there was more to the drama than just ?villains, heroes, [and] surprises at regular intervals?? And surely ? even if he had indeed been ?na?ve about what was going on? ? Waugh later came to know more about it than he reveals here? 

 ?Low player payments, endless meaningless one-day games and greedy administrators? is perhaps the most na?ve explanation of why Australian cricketers might have been tempted to accept money from the bookies. Waugh does not say that these were the reasons, but mentioning them helps, since one of the biggest off-the-field battles he fought was with the Australian cricket board, under which ?...as players, we had no representation, no place to air grievances, and apparently no right to question [the board?s] wisdom?.

 The picture is not very different in the subcontinent, except for the fact that here, the policy of non-interference in players? personal endorsement contracts ensures that their feathers are not ruffled; the game?s infrastructure can go take a walk. For vignettes of the damage done to the game by administrators in India, one could easily turn to Waugh?s autobiography, which also provides a glimpse into the transformation of the game in India from the Eighties to the Nineties. Touring India in 1986 meant being resigned to mouldy carpets in hotels, telephones that didn?t work, ?diabolical headaches? from Indian beers, and ?Delhi belly? from the curries and milkshakes. On the field, there would be 40,000 spectators in grounds that could accommodate only 20,000, and ineffective and cheap plastic covering where ?super soppers? were a crying need. The board felt no urge to give back to the game something by way of improved facilities while having no qualms about lapping up the millions in revenue. There is no evidence that things have changed radically now, although a general improvement in affairs meant that when Waugh and his boys toured India in 2001, the Indian captain, Sourav Ganguly, was by far the biggest irritant.

 But not as much as blown-up stories in the Indian media might suggest. In fact, Waugh has a lot more to say about a Curtly Ambrose or a Wasim Akram than about Ganguly (who, given the way things stand today, would give his right arm to be able to bid farewell to cricket the way Waugh did). But the real gems, culled from his career-long habit of maintaining tour diaries, are about his own ?mates?. Take for instance the English billboard inspired by Terry Alderman?s insatiable energy to appeal for an lbw. Underneath ?Thatcher out? was written, in graffiti scrawl, ?lbw Alderman?.

 Out of My Comfort Zone is the best book written by a cricketer to have come out in a long time. And not least because it uncovers a man who played cricket for the love of the game, but was also aware that the world does not revolve around cricket or cricketers. Thanks to Steve Waugh, the next time someone says, ?I?ll play my natural game,? we will know that he only means: ?I?m hoping I don?t take the gas and choke with the nerves.?

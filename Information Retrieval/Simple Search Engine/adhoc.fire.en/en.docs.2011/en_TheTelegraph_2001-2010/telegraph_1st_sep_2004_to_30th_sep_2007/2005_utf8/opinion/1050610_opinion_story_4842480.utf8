 CHRIST?S LAST HOURS

 What happened?

 The Passion 

 By Geza Vermes,

 Penguin, pound; 4.99

 The first question to ask is, why is it necessary for someone of the stature of Geza Vermes, arguably the greatest authority on the life of Jesus, to reconstruct the story of the Passion? One convenient answer is that Mel Gibson?s film on the Passion has aroused so much public interest in the incident that Vermes is cashing in on it. But there are more academic reasons for writing a book of this kind.

 There exist far too many discrepancies in the four gospels about the last few hours of Jesus?s life. For example, according to the Synoptic Gospels ? that is, the gospels of Mark, Matthew and Luke ? the Last Supper is a Passover meal. In the run-up to the dinner, the disciples are sent off to make the necessary preparations for a Passover meal. Luke makes Jesus say, ?I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you.? Not just these evangelists but even Paul, writing before them, described the Last Supper as a Passover meal. The origins of the Eucharist also lie in that last Passover meal of Christ. Yet in John?s gospel, the Last Supper takes place before the Passover. The subsequent narrative suggests that Jesus?s last meal took place on 14 Nisan, the day before the Jews celebrated the Passover. Moreover, John makes no allusion to the institution of the Eucharist.

 The implications of this discrepancy are enormous. If the last meal was eaten on Passover, how did the trial, and that too of a capital case, take place, against all regulations, on a feast day?

 Another example is that the suicide of Judas Iscariot is only mentioned by Matthew (27: 3-10). Similarly, there is no agreement among the evangelists about what Jesus actually said during his dying moments on the cross. According to Mark and Matthew, he cried, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? In Luke?s version, he says, ?Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit.? In John, the dying words are, ?It is finished.? It is significant that Mark and Matthew preserve the original Aramaic, and that the lines are in fact the same as the first verse of Pslam 22.

 Vermes proceeds like a detective. He lays down before his readers all the available evidence from the gospels about what happened to Jesus from the Last Supper to his death on the cross. He notes all the various differences between the four versions. (The differences are principally between John and the Synoptic Gospels). He then sets this corpus of evidence against what is known from non-New Testament sources, and against all that is known about Jewish law, Roman law of the time and the prevailing customs and conventions. Through this elaborate sifting and analysis of the available evidence, Vermes arrives at a plausible sequence of events.

 His version is as follows. On Thursday evening when the eve of Passover (14 Nisan) began, Jesus had a meal with his disciples. It was not a Passover meal and did not contain any allusion of the Eucharist. He was later arrested by a contingent of the Temple police escorted by Judas. The former high priest, Annas, interrogated Jesus and he was then sent to the high priest, Caiaphas. On Friday morning (still 14 Nisan by the Jewish calendar) it was decided by the Sanhedrin (the senate) to produce Jesus before the Roman governor, Pilate, and charge him with sedition. Pilate condemned Jesus to crucifixion. Before his crucifixion, Jesus was scourged. At noon on the eve of Passover (14 Nisan), Jesus was crucified. He died at 3 pm with the cry in Aramaic: Eloi, Eloi lama sabachthani? His death was witnessed by a group of Galilean women. He was buried before the onset of Passover and the Sabbath on Saturday, 15 Nisan.

 Vermes adds that in AD 30, the year of the Passion, Passover, celebrated at the full moon on 15 Nisan, fell on Saturday, April 8. This would mean, if Vermes?s sequence is valid, that Jesus died on Friday, April 7, AD 30.

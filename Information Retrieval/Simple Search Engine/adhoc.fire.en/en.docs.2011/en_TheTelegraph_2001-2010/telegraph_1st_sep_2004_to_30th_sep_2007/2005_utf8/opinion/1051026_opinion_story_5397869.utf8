 CHANGED TACK

 The portrait of a politician as a fugitive is not exactly new in India. But the case of Mr Manabesh Chowdhury shows much more. His story captures the abuse of power and the defiance of the rule of law that have long become synonymous with the rule of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in Bengal. If a senior leader of the party could thus escape the law for nearly 20 years, it is easy to imagine how lesser partymen treated it. There is an ominous ring to the call by the party?s state secretary, Mr Anil Biswas, to some 800 absconding party workers to surrender to the courts. It shows that the party ? and, presumably, also the government ? knew about their crimes and helped them evade the law. It cannot but be disquieting for law-abiding citizens to know that their rulers are also law-breakers. For the ordinary people, Mr Biswas?s thesis of a ?conspiracy? against Mr Chowdhury would be familiar political noise. What seems more realistic is the feeling that the party has conspired to subvert the rule of law in Bengal. Mr Chowdhury?s case is an unambiguous indictment of the CPI(M)?s ways with the law.

 Yet, Mr Chowdhury?s long-delayed surrender to the law is not a result of a change of heart for the Marxists. They have been compelled to accept the law only by the Election Commission?s tough stand on politicians who have non-bailable arrest warrants pending against them for more than six months. The CPI(M) has suddenly woken up to the need for a face-saving strategy after the EC threatened to delete the names of such political workers from the voters? lists. Embarrassment apart, the directive seems to have posed serious problems for the CPI(M)?s plans for next year?s assembly polls. However, it is for Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to try and transform this challenge into an opportunity. He can use this as an incentive to clean up Bengal?s politics. While the CPI(M) remains the main culprit, the opposition parties too have skeletons in their cupboards. The arrest warrant against the Congress member of parliament, Mr Adhir Chowdhury, is the most glaring case in point. But the chief minister has to set the example by not only dropping Mr Narayan Biswas from his cabinet but also getting him arrested. The minister faces the same charges as Mr Manabesh Chowdhury and has an arrest warrant against him. Bad politics can be a drag on his good economics.

 DIARY

 The Congress seems to have a thing for heights (metaphorically-speaking). So on the occasion of each reshuffle of the cabinet, some are cut down to size, while others given a boost to grow in stature. Take the case of Ambika Soni and Priya Ranjan Das Munshi for example. Over the past few months, Soni had regained so much of her former clout in the party that she had good reasons to be hopeful about getting the information and broadcasting portfolio. In fact appointment-seekers at her office at the party headquarters had been told to contact her at her new office the following week. But what man proposes, 10 Janpath disposes. There was another of those fabled poune char foot oonchaye wala Bengali dadas to contend with, and one Soni had apparently often dismissed as being an essentially ?Chhatra Parishad kind of fellow?. Hopefully, now that Priyada has had his ?boost?, he should have the ?energy? to dispel doubts that he is merely a stop-gap arrangement before the job is taken over by Soni ? ?one of the general secretaries? when he headed the youth Congress, as he is often prone to describe her.

 A cabinet reshuffle can launch a thousand dreams. If it prompts some to book early morning flights to the capital, well in time for a possible ?swearing-in?, it adds a spring in the activities of many others. One such hopeful was the commerce minister, Kamal Nath, who seemed to be in full flow during a conference last week. Asked if the left was hampering his work in the ministry, he asked instead how many journos were there from Bengal. When a large number of backbenchers raised their hands, he quipped, ?Why are you sitting at the back? You fellows should be in the driving seat up in the front!? His sense of humour must have taken a nosedive when the eagerly-awaited power portfolio did not land on his lap on his birthday Friday last.

 High on the hills, all eyes are focussed on the new CM of Jammu and Kashmir, and the kind of administration he provides to a strife-torn state. Azad, who has never played a political role in his home state till he took over as the state Congress chief three years back, gave everyone a pleasant surprise though. A circular issued immediately after the take-over announced that none of his relatives should be entertained by anyone in the government. It could not have pleased his in-laws who reportedly lobbied hard to make him CM. 

 The apex court may have another surprise waiting for it. The POTA case against Uttar Pradesh?s notorious minister, Raja Bhaiya, has been shifted to Madhya Pradesh by the court with the fond hope that here he would be insulated against any privileged treatment. But logic suggests otherwise. The CM of MP, Babulal Gaur, hails from Bhaiya?s hometown, Pratapgarh. And during his recent visit home, Gaur was given a rising welcome by Bhaiya himself, who was there to receive ?Pratapgarhia, sabse badhia? Gaur. Babulal was so moved that he announced a Rs 50 lakh bonanza for his village. Time again to reciprocate the hospitality, Gaur?

 And it is not merely the Supreme Court which has to be on guard. We?ll explain why. Last week, Margaret Alva, the Congress gen-sec in charge of Maharashtra, met a delegation of leaders led by Ranjit Deshmukh, at her residence. They had come to complain about her choice of the district Congress unit chief. Half an hour into the meet, Alva realized that a television crew, which had been smuggled in, was quietly recording the deliberation. A horrified Alva immediately ordered them out, and later confided to friends how luckily she had escaped a trap laid in the hope that she would say something damaging. Deshmukh, the director of the operation, it goes without saying, got an earful.

 The Congress seems to have found its voice in election-bound Kerala. Well, almost. The party has launched Veenaksham, which is supposed to be the Congress?s Ganashakti in the state. A brainchild of the Kerela Congress unit chief, the paper was launched by the FM, P Chidambaram. And that is where the problem lay, seemingly. Barely days after the launch, partymen were quibbling about why Chidambaram had been made the guest of honour when he still considered himself an outsider. The FM, apparently, is in the habit of asking his ministerial colleagues, ?How is your party?? referring to the Congress. But are they sure they?ve got the FM?s reference to ?party? alright?

 Ignorance is bliss, and the Congress party spokesperson, Anand Sharma, it seems, is unwilling to do anything to disturb that state of mind. At a press briefing at the Congress HQ, Sharma called the Naxalites terrorists, and made journos on the Congress beat jump out of their seats. The Congress, they knew all this while, had taken a very different view on the species. Sonia Gandhi, at a recent speech in Chandigarh, had asked her party to see Naxalism as part of a larger problem. Digvijay Singh, party gen-sec in charge of Andhra Pradesh, who has a more direct feel of Naxalism, insists that the party sees it as a ?socio-economic problem?. But Sharma obviously does not see what his partymen see. On being asked if Sharma?s was the party-line on Naxalism, the spokesman is believed to have said there was no difference between what madam had said and he was insisting. Ahem! Looks like Congresswallahs should sit down and compare their notes.

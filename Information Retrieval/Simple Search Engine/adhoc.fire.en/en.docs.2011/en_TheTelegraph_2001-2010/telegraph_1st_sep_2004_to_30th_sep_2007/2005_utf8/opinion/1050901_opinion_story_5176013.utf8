 Letters to Editor

 Win some, lose some 

 Sir ? England?s spectacular victory over Australia in the fourth test at the Oval should end the latter?s hegemony over test cricket. Perhaps the team?s long winning streak had gone to the heads of the Australian players who had become known for their arrogant behaviour both on and off the field. Thanks to Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath and Ricky Ponting, a new unruliness entered the ?gentleman?s game?. With one more test to go (and the Englishmen narrowly missed winning the third one too), England should hopefully retain or increase its lead in the Ashes series and humble the Aussies. The emergence of England as the new world champions of test cricket augurs well for the game.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Ram, Calcutta

 Sir ? As for the Indian team, it has kept up its record of pathetic performances in Zimbabwe. It seems we are capable of beating only Bangladesh and Zimbabwe. There is hardly anything that Greg Chappell can do as the coach is only as good as his team. The time has come for the BCCI to be tough on the overhyped Indian cricketers. The whole setup, from the selectors to the selection process, should be overhauled. Heads must roll, however famous. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir ? After India?s dismal performance against the Kiwis in the first one-day international of the Videocon tri-series, played at Bulawayo, many will call for Sourav Ganguly?s head and pitch for Rahul Dravid as the answer to all our troubles. But the point that needs to be pondered now is, what is the use of foreign coaches? Since the series in Sri Lanka in which Chappel debuted as the Indian coach, the team?s performance has dropped. It was during the tenure of Chapell?s predecessor and India?s first foreign coach, John Wright, that India seemed to be losing its inability to play quality spin-bowling by the likes of Daniel Vettori, Upul Chandana, Brad Hogg and Ashley Giles. Strangely, Indian batsmen have always had a facility for playing spinners well; in fact, they have scored most from the spinners (for example, Sachin Tendulkar against Shane Warne in the 1998 India-Australia series). Wright put a lot of emphasis on teaching our bowlers how to stare the fast-bowlers in the eye, but the Indian batsmen are still weak in this area. Even our bowlers have been found wanting; in the last few matches, their failure to keep up the momentum going through the innings has cost us the matches. The BCCI should pick a desi specialist to look into every aspect of the team instead of hiring expensive people from abroad. 

 Yours faithfully,

Debnath Chattoraj, Asansol

 Sir ? It is high time Indian cricket?s apex body changed its name from the Board of Control for Cricket in India to one that is more the standard across the cricketing world ? the Indian Cricket Board, for instance. The present name is a relic of the government?s tendency of trying to ?control? everything without understanding what it is trying to control. Perhaps a change of name would trigger some soul searching and help the board encourage the sport at all levels.

 Yours faithfully,

Bhaskar Majumdar, Kuwait

 Sir ? The Union sports ministry?s decision not to give the Arjuna Award or Rajiv Khel Ratna Award to any cricketer this year was one that our cricketers well deserved. We have the best batting side in the world ? on paper at least ? but from the Sri Lankan tri-series to the present series in Zimbabwe, our bunch of talented players have failed, in easy situations as much as in a crunch. Against the Kiwis in Bulawayo, the Indian team was 48 for 8 at a time, yet another nadir. It?s now clear that Greg Chapell?s introduction as coach and Sourav Ganguly?s return as captain have not helped improve our team?s performance. Although, in theory, India can still make it to the finals, and even win the Videocon tri-series, does the team have it in it to do so? The Indian selectors should pick on young cricketers and drop Virendra Sehwag, Ganguly and other out-of-form players, at least for the time being.

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

 Sir ? Two new-comer tail-enders, Irfan Pathan and J.P. Yadav, saved India from a possibly more humiliating defeat to the New Zealanders in Bulawayo. Our senior cricketers left no stone unturned to create one more record of the least score in one-dayers. 

 India should opt for a computerized selection of cricket-team, on a trial basis at least. All data on contenders must be fed into the computer and the machine left to decide. The software should also incorporate the views of the spectators about team-selection. This system will force the senior cricketers to concentrate on the game rather than on its commercial aspects. 

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir ? It?s really ridiculous that a team full of such high-profile players is struggling to find its feet. In the match, Yuvraj Singh missed a catch by Craig Macmillan, his attempt being acrobatic enough to be a stunt in the movies. No wonder, the team has not won a series for a long time, and is now struggling to beat the underlings. 

 Yours faithfully,

Debanjan Chakraborty, Calcutta

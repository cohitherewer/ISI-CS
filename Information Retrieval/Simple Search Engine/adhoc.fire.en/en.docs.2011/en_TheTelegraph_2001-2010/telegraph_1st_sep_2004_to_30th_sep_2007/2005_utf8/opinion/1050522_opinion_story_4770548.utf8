 MANY OF US DIDNT EVEN KNOW THE GOVERNMENT 

HAD CHANGED 

VILLAGE VOICES

 LONG WAIT: For these folk the more things 

 change, the more they remain the same (Photo: Rajesh

Village India is like an out-of-date year-book. When you are in a time-warp, changes ? however important ? pass you by. So the significance of May 22, 2004, is not something that the people of some of the poorer regions of Uttar Pradesh can recall with ease. And the face ? or the name ? of the man who took oath as the Prime Minister of India that day rings no bell. 

 To be fair to the villager, there were not too many outside the living rooms of Indias urban middle class who knew Manmohan Singh last year in May. And to be fair to the Prime Minister, not too many in rural India can recall the names of his predecessors either. 

 Salma and Guddiya of a Dalit village called Chauhatana in Agra district look nervously around because they have not heard of Manmohan Singh. But, Atal Bihari Vajpayee ? the first politician outside the Nehru-Gandhi family to rule a full term, and more ? is not a name they know either. And H.D. Deve Gowdas name can only lead to a baffled look. Rajiv Gandhi draws a flicker. The two women, scooping out the filth of a gutter into a hand-held basket, start smiling only when Indira Gandhi is mentioned. Yes, they have heard of her. She was the Prime Minister. 

 Manmohan Singh has only been there a year ? unlike Indira Gandhi, who spent 15 years as Prime Minister. Years from now, there may be a time when village India will stop on its tracks to remember the economist who spoke passionately about rural India. Right now, however, the best that Raju ? an unemployed youth of the village ? can do is recall that he is the man with the turban. There is a television at home, but the news is seldom watched. When there is electricity, and the family has the time, they mill around the TV to watch a film. 

 But then, village India is not a homogenous body, either. The poorest of the poor have no time to spare for a discussion on governance. But in the local school in Bichpuri ? a veritable Banyan Tree when it comes to political discussions ? Manmohan Singh is a name that the people doff their pagdis to. He is a clean man, says English teacher Sheesh Ram Sharma. And that, in a place where corruption is as much a way of life as caste, is high praise. 

 This is where the people know about Sonia Gandhi, too, and talk reverentially about how she spurned the Prime Ministers gaddi. In Mulayam Singhs Uttar Pradesh, and in an area where the Jat is strong, as is the Jatav, the villager is all praise for Manmohan Singh. He is a man without intrigue, says Bichpuri school principal Uttam Singh. There is no corruption in his language or action, asserts a state education officer, Subedar Singh. 

 But, prodded some more, they stress that there is little that the honest Prime Minister has done for the villager. And, in an unguarded moment, an old man admits that when Manmohan Singh was installed as the 14th Prime Minister of India, not many in the villages knew of the political development. For quite some time, many of us didnt even know that the government had changed, he says. 

 Clearly, as the prophets of doom often intone, the more things change, the more they remain the same.

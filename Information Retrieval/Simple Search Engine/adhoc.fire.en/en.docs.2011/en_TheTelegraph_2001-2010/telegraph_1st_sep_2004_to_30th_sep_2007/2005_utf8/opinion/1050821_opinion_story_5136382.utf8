 RULE BY PROXY

 Compulsions inherent in a political coalition should not be extended to mean a complete surrender of initiative. The United Progressive Alliance is supposed to be led by the Congress. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) is a part of the coalition even though it is not a part of the government. This means that the UPA, for purposes of maintaining its majority in the Lok Sabha, is dependent on the CPI(M). But this dependence is by no means one-sided, since the CPI(M) also has a vested interest in keeping the UPA government in power. Yet in practice, the Congress?s dependence on the CPI(M) has given to the term ?leadership? a completely new meaning and connotation. To any observer, it would appear that the Congress has abdicated its leadership of the UPA in favour of the CPI(M) and the left. On every important matter of policy, the left has forced the government to either withdraw or go on the backfoot. This has given rise to the very justified query: who is ruling India, the Congress or the left?

 A simple narration of facts should provide vital clues to an answer to the question. The government proposed a sale of 10 per cent of its equity in Bhel. The CPI(M) and the left objected to it, the government retreated and said it would review the matter. This is not enough for the left, it continues to sulk and wants the government to abandon the proposal. Such is the power of the left?s threat that the government has decided to soft-pedal disinvestment of public sector units. The left has also forced the retreat from the decision to reduce government equity in public sector banks to 33 per cent. In fact, the left has forced a slow-down of economic reforms. There is a big question mark hovering over foreign direct investment in retail, over the scheme to use provident funds in the market to earn higher interests, higher FDI ceiling in insurance and so on. It would not be an exaggeration to conclude that the left has effectively throttled every move made by the present government to take the Indian economy closer to being free and competitive. The left would like the Indian economy to remain a subsidy raj, if not a socialist one.

 This grim list suggests that the Congress has surrendered its leadership. It may not have handed over the leadership to the comrades in Gopalan Bhavan but it has most certainly made governance a victim to the left?s continuing blackmail. The prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, the pioneer of economic reforms, cuts a rather sorry figure in the context. His plight is aggravated by his knowledge of the fact that most Congressmen, including some leaders, would be quite happy to bid adieu to economic reforms. The suspension of the will to govern and lead allows the left to rule by proxy. It is allowed to enjoy power without responsibility, and the Congress is happy to have responsibility without power. It is a perfect match to ensure non-governance.

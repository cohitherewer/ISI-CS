 DOME IN WRAPS

 Calcutta sometimes boggles one?s sense of the absurd. A new scheme is now taking up the time of such august and busy institutions as the high court, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the Archaeological Survey of India. The dome of the Victoria Memorial will have to be wrapped up in polythene. Should this be done, or should this not be done? Will it look pretty, or will it look ugly? Will it stop water from dripping into the building? Such profound questions are now being debated and contemplated by important public servants in all solemnity. The Victoria Memorial is certainly a local treasure, housing other local treasures. But when important public bodies and institutions of state, with their own workload and backlog, spend valuable time pondering such imponderables, then it is time to wonder about how exactly Calcutta functions as a city, what the courts and the state machinery are there for, and how valuable things held in common in the city are to be looked after in a sensible fashion. 

 The Victoria Memorial is an important example, since it is often at the centre of civic controversy although it is precisely this category of the ?civic? which needs clarification here. The memorial has to be saved from air pollution; the greens surrounding it have to be cleared of garbage or incessant melas; the art treasures in the building have to be restored and conserved; its grounds have to be saved from unwanted visitors; yet more visitors have to be enticed by developing an entire complex around the main building; the architecture of this complex has to be appropriate and the plan given to the right people. The list goes on endlessly, and each time the solutions are either absurd, or the scheme dies a natural death or gives rise to unseemly and unresolved controversy. This is a state in which museums lose priceless medals and artworks, in which invaluable paintings rot unattended in neglected store-rooms. There are millions of marble domes all over the world, but none of them is wrapped in polythene for protection.

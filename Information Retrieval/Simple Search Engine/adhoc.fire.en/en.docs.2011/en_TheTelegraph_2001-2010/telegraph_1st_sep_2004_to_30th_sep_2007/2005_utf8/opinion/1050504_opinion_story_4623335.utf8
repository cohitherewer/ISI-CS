 WHY THERE SHOULD BE A HOPE IN HELL

 The success of Bhalki, a village in Bengal, shows that it is possible to follow a model of governance which is not Western, writes Bhaskar Ghose

 Make the difference

 ?Both evolutionary science and the experiences of the 20th century have taught us that evolution has no direction that allows us concrete predictions about its future social, cultural and political consequences.? This is an excerpt from Eric Hobsbawm?s address to the Gorbachev Foundation in March 2005 in Turin.

 The point that Hobsbawm made in his address, leading directly from the comment I have quoted, is that the last ?utopian project? left over from the previous century is that the mode of government achieved by the United States of America or the European Union, however undesirable, is destined to conquer the world and is not subject to historic transformation and impermanence.

 That has, indeed, been the tragic story of the numerous development schemes tried out in this country, many of which have not had the impact that they were expected to. In its appraisal of the ninth plan, the Planning Commission identified some of the reasons why there was a slowdown in the development of the agricultural sector. Among them were ?low public investment in irrigation, and poor maintenance of rural infrastructure, specially (sic) canals and roads; decline in investments in rural electrification and its availability; rising levels of subsidies for power, water, fertilizers and food, [which] are eating into public sector investments in agriculture, besides inducing inefficient use of scarce resources.? Later, in the tenth plan document, it highlighted the unsatisfactory administrative machinery as a major factor.

 The fact is, all of these are based on models that are no different from models of projects and schemes that have been worked out along the lines with which the planners were familiar. And, almost without their being aware of it, these were based on assumptions and perceptions fashioned in the course of the studies many of the planners had followed in Western universities and institutions. This was not a new and alien feature; the manner in which we govern ourselves has been copied with painful fidelity from Western models. It was, as was the planning process at different levels, the utopian project that Hobsbawm referred to, being dutifully put into effect by those brought up on the assumption that what was Western was necessarily better, or the best.

 Now let?s move away from this to a specific instance of something entirely different ? to the village of Bhalki in Burdwan district in West Bengal. A media report on this village says that it has put into effect some of the recommendations made by McKinsey, the management consultants who had earlier been commissioned by the state government to prepare a report on strategies for rural development. Now, McKinsey may be a US-based firm, but the people who worked on the project clearly were not, whatever their training, obsessed by Western models. Nonetheless, the hardliners in the ruling Left Front opposed the implementation of the report and that was that.

 However, by a process the report does not elaborate, the district committee of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in Burdwan and the local block development officer decided to implement at least some of the recommendations in the report. The result was that the villagers used alternative farming, leasing out land that was in patches barren, to a self-help group which used it to grow medicinal plants. These are now being exported by an export house in Calcutta, and the land has become profitable. Another farmer used another measure recommended in the report ? contract farming. He leased out his land to a self-help group called Bharat-barsho. He has had his lease amount doubled within a year. A member of the district committee of the CPI(M) is reported to have said, ?It is unimportant whether Marx or McKinsey played a role so long as we are getting good results from the method.?

 The initial resistance from hardliners melted away when they saw the results at Bhalki. Other villages in the area are adopting the same strategies, and the ruling party seems to now want to portray Bhalki as a model of development. And just as well. Whether by accident or by design, they have taken up a method that does not follow time-honoured patterns of development ? loans, grants, ?model? farms run inefficiently by the government, and all the rest of the tried techniques which assumed that villagers were terminally ill and had to be treated like patients.

 This is what has happened in one village. But what of the Centre, or the states, which are doing their best to follow the Westminster model of parliamentary democracy? This was the system considered by the leaders of the country in the early years of self-rule and later, of independence, as the best method of governing the country. It has been the system that has brought to the fore such worthies as Laloo Yadav, Raja Bhaiyya, Pappu Yadav, and a host of others who have either tried to stand the system on its head or have a string of criminal cases registered against them. Sometimes both.

 We have seen how parliament has been virtually paralysed as some members have created such pandemonium in both houses that no business could be transacted, sometimes for days together. Repeated appeals from the speaker in the Lok Sabha or the chairman of the Rajya Sabha and meetings of party leaders have not had much effect. What seems evident is that political parties feel that disruptive protests in both houses are more effective than raising a point of order and then debating an issue, rationally.

 But the issue is not the disruption of the proceedings of parliament; it is really something more basic. Is this system one that serves us as effectively as it should? In other words, is it Bhalki or one of the failed development schemes that the government has tried to implement over the last few decades? 

 It is significant that when the then English colonies in America became independent, they did not adopt a system that corresponded either to the one then in existence in Britain, or one that was a copy of something in another country. What they devised, and still have, with some changes, is something that they fashioned for themselves. I mention this not because I, too, have fallen into the trap Hobsbawm has pointed to, but because that is just what did not happen in the fledgling US. This demonstrates that it is possible to have alternatives to systems of governance that exist in the West, whether in the US or in the EU.

 Perhaps it may be the one we already have, with some modifications; perhaps it may be a form of presidential governance or something else. But whatever it is, we need to look at the little village of Bhalki to see how a problem that appeared insoluble can be solved. To the villagers the village was, and is, in many ways still, the universe. To the country, then, governance may be seen as a difficult task but one that can be done in the way that suits us best. Social hope and historical realism; the phrase is Hobsbawm?s but one that we need to make our own.

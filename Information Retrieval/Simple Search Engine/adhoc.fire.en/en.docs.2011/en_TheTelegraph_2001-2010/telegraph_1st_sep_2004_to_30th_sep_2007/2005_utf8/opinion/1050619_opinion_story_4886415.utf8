 Bunty aur Babli is riding a wave of success. The box-office returns say so. Its a simple story about a small-town boy and girl who run away from their homes to chase their dreams. Their running away ? a conscious, goal-driven decision ? pays off: it brings Abhishek and Rani together. Having fulfilled their dreams by conning people, they realise their folly and return home, only to start out afresh after three years, but this time the law is on their side. 

 Alls well that ends well.

 London-based IBM employee Rajiv Bhattacharyas saga has also found a happy resolution. At least for the moment. Last Sunday, the man ? who had been missing for two days before he surfaced in Mughalsarai ? married his fianc?e, Suparna Chakraborty, putting to rest all speculation about the reasons behind his mysterious vanishing act.

 Bhattacharya could have been a mere statistic ? one of 3,000 to 3,500 people who go missing every year in Calcutta. Like Bunty and Babli he came back home, but unlike them ? and like many others missing ? nobody quite knew what happened.

 Had he not tied the knot, it would have confirmed suspicions that his unexpected disappearance was connected to his unwillingness to marry, ? la Julia Roberts in The Runaway Bride or worse, like Jennifer Wilbanks, who has gained notoriety as the runaway bride in the US. Last Wednesday, Wilbanks was indicted by a grand jury in Georgia for faking her own abduction and sexual assault before a planned wedding to which 600 people had been invited.

 Common practice

 Bhattacharya, insist his family members, has never been irresponsible. Even though he has lived in the United States and is now in London, he always keeps us posted, says Partha Banerjee, his brother-in-law. He is essentially a homebody.

 Bhattacharyas friend Ritesh Das who has known the techie since their engineering days at Jadavpur University recalls that his initial reaction to his friends disappearance was that of disbelief. He isnt the type to just go missing all of a sudden, Das says.

 Fact is, Bhattacharya did. Clearly, it was not a case of abduction as there necessarily are signs of violence in a scene of abduction, points out Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner, detective department, at the Calcutta police headquarters at Lalbazar. In this case there were none. When something like this happens at 11 in the morning at as busy a cross-section as Ultadanga, it couldnt surely have gone unnoticed?

 Running away from home or going missing ? however one chooses to put it ? is a common practice worldwide, whatever be the reasons. Although it can never be a solution to ones problems ? as the princess in Roman Holiday found out the hard way ? the desire to run away is, perhaps, one nurtured secretly by almost everyone at some stage. It could be merely for the sake of going on a wild adventure, making a tempestuous teenage statement, or an idle dream of escaping from the clutches of quarrelsome siblings and nagging parents, or simply, for avoiding ones boss at the workplace.

 The police, says Sanjib Kumar Ghosh, officer-in-charge, missing persons squad, Lalbazar, succeeds in finding 60 to 65 per cent of those who go missing. Sometimes, it takes a few days but at times the investigation stretches beyond seven years. And it is in the seventh year that the missing individual is legally declared dead.

 While dreams and goals which seem impossible to pursue when at home are often reasons for running away, other causes may well be mental disorders such as schizophrenia, depression stemming from family problems, a drift into a transient lifestyle due to substance abuse and dissociative disorders. This is triggered by an illogical feeling of fearfulness of the persons familiar surroundings which force him to leave that place and wander away aimlessly to some safer destination, explains psychiatrist Ashim Chatterjee, attached to the Mon Foundation.

 Chatterjee cites the case of a patient, a homosexual, who had gone away of his own accord. He was sexually abused, suffered a nervous breakdown and then finally returned home and is undergoing treatment. There is one particular phase that he insists he cant recall and simply refuses to talk about, says the psychiatrist. But this, he stresses, is not a case of amnesia, but of denial ? a willful turning away.

 ROAD ROMANCE: A scene 

 from 

 Bunty aur Babli

Does anyone care?

 Drawing a parallel with the Bhattacharya case, he elaborates, When someone says, I dont remember what happened for a short spell, the person is not suffering from amnesia. If it is a case of amnesia, he will certainly say something that might be confusing, contradictory, and he will try his utmost to remember but he will never categorically state that he cant recall. Such instances fall under the purview of going missing due to socio-political stressers.

 At times, there is a belief among those who go missing that their families wouldnt feel their absence. Quite often, they are astonished to find that people are actually looking for them. And, at times, this may complicate matters in an unexpected way, as Ghosh points out. He reminisces that a few days ago, a well-dressed elderly gentleman came looking for him at Lalbazar. He was livid because he had seen his photograph in the missing persons slot on Doordarshan, and said that he had ever since been contemplating suicide.

 It took Ghosh sometime to figure out that the gentleman was trying to tell him that not only was he not missing, he was also not being missed at home. There had been some friction between him and his only son and daughter-in-law over property matters and the man decided to walk out, he says. He made me promise not to let his son and daughter-in-law know of his whereabouts and said he would not move back into the house as long as the couple lived there.

 In such cases, Ghosh is often forced to mediate and act as counsellor. He says he feels a moral responsibility to settle the internal environment before sending the missing person back within the family fold. In this case, the gentleman didnt even realise that he was missing because, according to his logic, he knew where he was and that was all that mattered to him, says the officer-in-charge.

 Ties that bind

 Having tackled such incidents for several years now, Ghosh has developed considerable understanding of the workings of the human mind that prompt an individual to take such a drastic step. The key to avoiding such a situation in the first place is by enhancing individual resilience and resourcefulness, openly addressing complex circumstances that may have built up over a long time and strengthening family and community networks, he stresses.

 Ghosh, perhaps, is right. Both adults and young people interviewed by the officials of the department of vagrancy say that those who run away would possibly not have done so if communication between them and their families had been better, or if they had received prior advice, counselling and mediation. Prasanta Banerjee (name changed) is a case in point. Banerjee had, by his own admission, quietly left home last year.

 A professional working for a corporate house, Banerjee was doing reasonably well for himself. Problems cropped up when he chose to marry a girl who worked for a beauty parlour. The girl had high aspirations and, indulging her, he gave up his job and decided to opt for business. But Banerjee lost his peace of mind and one thing led to another ? leading to a situation where he felt he had to flee. The choice was between living and going mad, he recalls. 

 MOVING OUT

 Reasons people run away can include:

 Abuse and violence at home

 Homophobia at home, at school or in the workplace

 Getting into debt

 Pressure to succeed in education, at work or 

 at home

 Bullying

 Illness

 Home sweet home

 He returned, though not quite in a repentant mood, because he says he realised he couldnt run away from himself. Banerjees instance is, perhaps, what clinical psychologists label a case of avoidance coping. They believe that a short break from a difficult situation can help people deal with it better. Chatterjee puts it aptly when he says, For some people, avoidance is a good short-term strategy. It allows them to adjust and accommodate something that at first may seem impossible to deal with. It can be constructive, but it must only be a temporary state; at some point its necessary to start actively planning and coping.

 But not always can people take the cue. And when they miss it, the consequences can be devastating. As a person whose mother has been missing for over four years says sadly, My mother was always anxiety-prone and got tensed up over little things. We never ever thought that she had a mental problem. But had we detected that this was a mental illness, maybe we wouldnt have lost her.

 The experts warn that when it is a case of lost-and-found, family and friends should take care not to subject the person who had gone missing to a volley of questions. After all, those who take such a step usually want to repress the cause as it is anxiety-provoking, states psychiatrist, Suranjana Ganguly, attached to Calcutta Samaritans, an NGO. 

 However, if one does contemplate running away, the practical way to tackle the issue would perhaps be by way of answering the question, What is the best solution to my problem? Facing a problem is often a way of resolving it. Life, after all, is not always a box-office hit, ? la Bunty aur Babli.

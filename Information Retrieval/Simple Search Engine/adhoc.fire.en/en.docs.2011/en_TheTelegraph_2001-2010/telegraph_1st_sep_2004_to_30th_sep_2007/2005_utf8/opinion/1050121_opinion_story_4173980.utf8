 TOWARDS AN OASIS OF PEACE

 Tumpa Mukherjee

 So underworld dons like Aftab Ansari, Sheikh Vinod, Gabbar and Hatkata Dilip have been prevented from using their mobile phones and are secure in their jails. Will that decrease the crime rate in Calcutta? No. Why? Because Calcutta?s strategic location makes it vulnerable to crime. The city serves as a transit point for both militants and traffickers of women and drugs to Nepal and Bangladesh. The crime scene, in fact, is a curious reflection of a society in transition. For only a country that is advancing at an uneven pace can have cattle theft, insurance fraud, dacoity, stock swindles, murders, witchcraft and homicide at the same time. Calcutta has of late witnessed a variety of crimes ? credit card fraud, attack on senior citizens, theft of manhole covers, power theft, crimes committed by domestic-help and women ? all an indication of the rapid changes the city is undergoing. 

 Till a few years ago, Calcutta had single- or double-storeyed houses, inhabited mostly by joint families. Within a decade, multi-storeyed buildings changed the skyline. Promoters started pulling down 2,000-odd square feet homes, to replace them with 600 sq ft cubicles in skyscrapers. Joint families broke up and single family units came to make up heterogeneous, multi-lingual neighbourhoods. The real estate boom attracted criminals. Promoters soon became the soft targets of extortionists, especially in Dum Dum, Lake Town and Rajarhat.

 Strengthen bonds

 The increasing crime rate has taught the city a lesson it should not forget ? the state can no longer play its role of the protector. What then? The need of the hour is community crime prevention. It is necessary to strengthen the city?s ?social capital?. But since its cosmopolitanism might serve as an impediment, it would be worthwhile to strengthen whatever social bonds remain to collectively prevent crime. Such activity can take the form of situational or social crime prevention.

 The first is often referred to as ?target hardening?, and include measures that either make victimization more difficult or minimize the loss when victimization occurs. It means using locks, window bars, fences, anti-theft alarms and electronic locking systems to eliminate physical intrusion. Surveillance can be maintained by installing close-circuit television at strategic locations in the locality. Nowadays, such TVs are set up in shopping malls, restaurants and inside Metro platforms. Recently, close-circuit video-aided traffic control systems have been installed at Esplanade, Rash Behari Avenue and Salt Lake with monitors in police stations. 

 Social welfare

 On the other hand, local clubs can organize neighbourhood watch groups for vigilance. The para culture is gradually fading into oblivion and needs rejuvenation. Other agencies with informal social control, like the media and educational institutions, should spread legal awareness among citizens. The servant verification scheme and the landlord-tenant verification scheme of the Calcutta police are progressive steps and the database can prove useful.

 The second approach delves into social ills, especially those that cause delinquency. In Calcutta, unchecked migration, coupled with unplanned urbanization, has resulted in squalor and filth. Slums are now the breeding grounds for criminals. It is necessary to organize literacy and drug prevention programmes, to promote juvenile welfare, poverty alleviation, women?s and children?s development, particularly for the marginalized sections. Several NGOs provide value-based education to street children. Thus, community crime prevention through participation and partnerships, is vital to make Calcutta an ?Oasis of peace?.

 SOUNDS AND SILENCE

 Forty years ago, Margaret Forster caught the public eye with her novel, Georgy Girl, which went on to become a best-seller.

 Since then, Forster has been writing steadily over the years. No one should grudge her the reward for that kind of consistent labour ? an amazing number of books, including critically-acclaimed biographies of Daphne du Maurier, Elizabeth Barrett Browning and the women in her family. Is There Anything You Want? is Forster?s 21st novel.

 Predictably enough, the story involves ordinary men and women and their mundane dilemmas. The ?action? ? too emphatic a word for a Forster novel ? revolves around St Mary?s Hospital and the seven women, ?fat, thin, old, young, married or single?, who visit it regularly for breast-cancer screening. Among them is Chrissie, an ultra-sensitive doctor and the niece of the much-resented do-gooder, Mrs Hibbert. The latter?s smug, overbearing manner is a facade for her sense of guilt and failure she can never bring herself to acknowledge. If there is any hint of drama, it lies in the arrival of the reticent new vicar who is an obvious misfit in the parish. Forster?s forte lies in her depiction of muffled cries, hushed whispers, and brooding pain. Indignation, not outrage, quiet resentment rather than open confrontation, petty failings and not serious flaws, feed the turmoil that lies beneath the placid surface of the lives of her characters. Marooned as they are on islands of loneliness, what binds them together is the disease that has afflicted five of the women. And in classic Forster tradition, the disease is not seen as the cause of death, but rather it remains like a disquieting presence in the background, kept at bay by the temporary reprieves.

 While the disease is on hold, it is the enemy within ? pain, failures and suppressed longings?that gnaws at the fragile minds of these individuals. It is significant, however, that for all their miseries, none of the protagonists consider rebellion as an option. Chrissie chooses to escape from the trauma of medical practice to the anonymity offered by a career in research; Rachel,the most dynamic of them all, seeks release from the fear of her affliction by learning to fly gliders.

 Compromise is the golden rule that keeps the troubled lives of Forster?s protagonists on course. And however ordinary they may seem, they command a sneaking respect. Their choices, in a quiet way, illustrate what the writer Kazuo Ishiguro had to say in another context: ?Life might just pick you up and dump you somewhere else. You just have to dignify the position you land in....?

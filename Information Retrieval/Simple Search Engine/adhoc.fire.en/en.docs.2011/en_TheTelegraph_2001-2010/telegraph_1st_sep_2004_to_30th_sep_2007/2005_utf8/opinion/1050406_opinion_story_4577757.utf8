 IN WRITING

 Language, like race and religion, is a powerful tool of identity politics. The movement in Manipur against the Bengali script is a case in point. There is nothing objectionable in the demand that the Bengali script be replaced by the native Meitei in school textbooks in the state. Historically, Bengali filled the vacuum when several native tongues in the North-east had yet to develop their own scripts. Only in the years after independence did governments take the initiative in developing and promoting the new scripts. The cause of the Kokborok script, used by the tribal people in Tripura, was promoted by the Left Front government there. It helped narrow the political and social divide between the tribal and the non-tribal people of the state. Manipur?s chief minister, Mr Okram Ibobi Singh, can take a leaf out of Tripura?s book. By doing so, he can play a crucial role in fulfilling the aspirations of the people. True, the administrative challenge of having the school texts rewritten in the Meitei script in a short time is not small. But an honest beginning would be a big step forward. 

 However, the organizations leading the script movement need to be more responsible. It is a stir that should have the sympathy and support of the people, especially in the Imphal valley where Meitei is spoken by the majority of the people. But the blockades on highways and other disruptive forms of protests, which recently threatened to plunge the state into a food crisis, may not serve the movement?s purpose. Such tactics can even alienate the people from it. Unfortunately, the danger of the stir degenerating into violence and chaos is quite real. An ominous sign was the threat by some leaders of the agitation to close down a school whose authorities did not allow the students to participate in one of their protests. Such irresponsible acts may not help the cause of either the Meitei script or Manipuri identity.

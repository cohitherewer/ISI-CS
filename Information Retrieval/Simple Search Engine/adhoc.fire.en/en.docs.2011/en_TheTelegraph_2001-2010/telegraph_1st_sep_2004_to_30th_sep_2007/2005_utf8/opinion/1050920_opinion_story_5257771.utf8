 ANARCHY ON OZONE DAY

 Malvika singh

 When you have the minister of environment and others, who claim to be protectors of precious natural resources, breaking the established norms to please political and industrial dispensations, you realize the hypocrisy of what they mouth on special ?days? like the International Ozone Day. Their departments have masterminded the denuding of forests, of the tiger and of all else that symbolizes conservation. 

 These same average intellects continue to eulogize Indira Gandhi for their selfish political ends as they support the dismantling of every law that she put in place as prime minister because she was savvy enough, unlike many who followed, to comprehend that a destruction of forests is the beginning of desertification, and the end of pure-water generation that will throw this country into social anarchy, the likes of which our present leadership cannot even begin to understand.

 She too, like all politicians, did whatever was required to garner more votes for her party, but she knew well where to draw the line. Today, with corruption rampant, and a frightening lack of knowledge about the environment, the UPA seems hell-bent on unravelling all the protection norms that Indira Gandhi had the foresight to put in place. They are killing her legacy in this area relentlessly. Manmohan Singh may be determined to push through the tribal bill in a superficial effort to ?right a wrong?, but he will have unleashed upon the ?tribals? unimaginable mafiosi. 

 Sixty-plus club

 To keep the national seats they presently have, the Congress may have to hit the hustings in March after they present the budget. This only because the implementation of all its ?bills? will be bungled and it will possibly be down to double digits. Just what the Left wants. The Left continues to busy itself by compelling the UPA to a state of utter inaction and regression as it, in sharp contrast, tries desperately to change its archaic and redundant positions and antics in West Bengal, its fiefdom. 

 The Left is merely digging a knife into the Congress, something that has been its wont forever, discrediting a decent government and forcing failure across the board. Singh regularly succumbs to these shameful pressures instead of calling their bluff and if necessary, sitting in opposition, in an attempt to perpetuate his beliefs for the dream he has about the future of India. If he does not begin to call the shots as leader of this government, he will be letting India and Bharat down by forcing people to wallow in poverty, corruption and anarchy.

 It would be politically astute to engineer a situation where a third front, with Prakash Karat playing George Fernandes, and with all the other parties clamouring for positions of power, come to power, sworn in by the president, and rule. They will last some months and will have thrown India into disarray making way for the Congress to return on its own. Why not risk that rather than be insulted day after day by old boys from elite universities carrying their textbook leftism into an age where even Marx would have amended Das Kapital? These boys, in sixty-plus garb, are indulging in incomprehensible, stale assertions. 

 Why cannot Singh and his government, along with the National Advisory Council, come up with some innovative approaches and solutions to deal with the horrors of poverty, distribution, corruption, of law and order in their broadest definition, of failed infrastructure, of restructuring jurisprudence, of inter-caste assault on innocents, and such everyday irregularities instead of obediently following failed and unacceptable rhetoric from some chaps sitting in the opposition who discredit the ruling party and who did not have the guts to join government and be accountable?

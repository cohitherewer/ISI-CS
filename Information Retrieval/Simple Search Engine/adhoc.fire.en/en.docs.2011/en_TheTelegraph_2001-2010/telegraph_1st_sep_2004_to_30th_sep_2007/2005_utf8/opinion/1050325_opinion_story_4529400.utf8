 Letters to Editor

 Good times, bad times

 Sir ? Vijay Mallya is not about to endear himself to the Indian masses, basking in the sun on a Rs 1,300-crore yacht (?King of good life savours a buy?, March 23). Not that this will give the beer baron sleepless nights, for he has built up his larger-than-life image in the same way that he built his liquor empire ? bit by bit. His image-building is actually a clever strategy ? he must use himself to advertise his products, restricted as liquor advertising is in India. Even Mallya?s harshest critics cannot fault him on this, since the double standards in India?s policy-making breed people like him. It is positively bizarre that liquor brands should still need to resort to surrogate advertising when it is clear as daylight that Kingfisher is not a brand of playing cards or bottled water. The Indian liquor surely does not mind the walking, talking advertisement it has in the form of Mallya.

 Yours faithfully,

 Feel the tax

 Sir ? In the entire budget document of this year, there are only three proposals which are being talked about widely. These are the transaction tax of 0.1 per cent for cash withdrawals of Rs 10,000 and above, introduction tax on fringe benefits, and the removal of standard deduction for salaried employees.Of these, the first two have found a number of campaigners, such as the trade associations, while the resentment of the wage-earning class has remained largely unrepresented, since they are not backed by any chamber of commerce. 

 Standard deduction has been an integral part of the Indian income tax structure for many decades. It is only the salaried class which pays income tax on total income, while for businessmen or firms, only the profits are taxable, never the total income. Thus businessmen can always exclude the expenditure incurred ? conveyance, entertainment, lunch and so on ? from the income, and pay tax on the profits ? something salaried employees cannot do. For efficient discharge of their duties and for career progression, salaried employees need to update their knowledge and take various examinations. This in turn requires them to pay membership fees to the relevant professional institutes (like the Institute of Engineers, Institute of Bankers and so on). Such expenses cannot be deducted from taxable income. To compensate for these, standard deduction was introduced. 

 Also, to keep up with the increase in the costs of living, this deduction was raised over the years and brought to Rs 30,000. There were also suggestions to raise it to Rs 50,000, and, during the Bharatiya Janata Party regime, even to Rs 100,000. There have, however, been speculations before budgets on a couple of occasions that the government was going to do away with standard deduction. The BJP government never dared to take such a step for fear of losing the huge salaried-class vote bank. Not that it made things any easier for the employees vis-?-vis income tax. 

 The United Progressive Alliance government, in the name of rationalizing the tax structure, has reduced income tax rates and replaced the tax rebates under section 88 by straight netting of the savings upto Rs 1,00,000 from taxable income. But how many employees and pensioners can save one lakh rupees in this age of skyrocketing living costs and inflation? Pensioners for instance can hardly save anything. For people like them, in the income slab of upto Rs 300,000, the removal of standard deduction is a heavy burden, even at the reduced income tax rate of 20 per cent for that slab. 

 If the government decides to roll back the transaction tax and fringe benefit tax under pressure from industry lobbies, it should also do the same for standard deduction.

 Yours faithfully,

R. Sambaiah, Calcutta

 Sir ? The BJP-ruled states? decision not to implement the value-added tax is motivated more by political reasons than economic ones. The party admits that VAT is a ?progressive tax system?, but is opposed to its ?bit by bit introduction?. The Centre wants its simultaneous implementation in all states, but cannot take a strong stand since it is a state subject. Before the BJP retracted, only Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu were reluctant to follow the April 1 deadline. If the BJP sticks to its decision, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand could also stay away from the VAT implementation programme.

 The transition from one tax regime to another is never smooth. But expert committees could be appointed to monitor the transition and sort out the problems as they arise. A lot of misinformation is already in circulation regarding VAT. The real reason for the opposition from a section of traders is that VAT will make tax evasion almost impossible. 

 The BJP?s reasons for opposing VAT do not hold much water. Most of the doubts raised by it are answered in the Centre?s White Paper. The saffronites say states would suffer revenue erosion, post-VAT. The Centre has assured that it would make good such losses. The BJP wants the Central sales tax to go, the Centre has already promised to phase it out. The saffron lobby says that there would be ?a lot of chaos and confusion? since UP and Tamil Nadu have not yet passed the VAT-enabling legislation. The Centre has addressed this concern by suggesting a solution about pro-VAT entry tax, which can be imposed on goods from the states that do not implement VAT. It is clear that the BJP?s pro-trader political compulsions are making it drag its feet on this vital national issue. 

 Yours faithfully,

Paroma Roy, Calcutta

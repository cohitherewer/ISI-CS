 THE KING IS DEAD AND GONE

 Snow 

 By Ellen Mattson, 

 Jonathan Cape, ?10.99

 Ellen Mattson, the author of this novel, boasts of an impressive literary pedigree ? she is the daughter of the well-known children?s author, Olle Mattson. Ellen is also one of Sweden?s most important young writers today.

 Lyrical and compelling, Mattson manages to capture the ethos of a coastal town in eighteenth-century Sweden with perfection. The novel is set in the winter and, not surprisingly, snow is its abiding motif. It is used to underscore the ennui and nihilism of the times and denotes an icy blanket of hopelessness, unbroken by even a glimmer of respite or redemption. However, the story is far from being lugubrious ? the buoyant human spirit is never far from the surface.

 Snow, the first novel by Mattson to be published in English, is a veritable tour de force. It is a poignant exploration of how an individual struggles to live by a code of ethics and honour in the face of political and social collapse. ?The sky is now a block of darkness, punctured only by driving snow. The stars have gone out, the king was dead. And the wound on his arm refused to heal.? Thus begins the novel, right in the thick of things. Snow delves into the tangled skein of doubts, fears and ambitions of an ordinary man, someone who is striving to cope with the troubled times.

 This man is Jakob T?rn, a small-town apothecary. A refugee from his home, he carries a deep stab-wound inflicted by his wife while he stumbles drunkenly through the streets. He does not comprehend what brought on this sudden violence, any more than he can come to terms with the death, in a battle, of his king.

 When the town begins to fill with the starving, frost-bitten remnants of the defeated army, Jakob is conscripted into helping to embalm the king?s body. Now, all his certainties are called into question. Jakob T?rn is a man beset with various dilemmas ? social, moral and emotional ? yet, he is strangely content. 

 He has been partially crippled in a military campaign for his king, and, now, his own wife, in a fit of rage, has wounded him. But this is how Jakob describes how he feels ? ?like a leaf floating on the water, being whirled round in the eddies, something drifting and enjoying being adrift?.

 Beautifully measured and unadorned, Snow does not claim to be a conventional ?historical novel?. Though set in 1718, on the west coast of Sweden, this novel is profoundly modern and universal, interested less in the real-life historical drama that forms the backdrop than in the emotional and moral questions before Jakob T?rn ? a simple, loyal, honourable man who finds himself at the damaged centre of a collapsing world. 

 Jakob is Everyman, and especially to denizens of today?s troubled world, he will be a compelling and relevant figure. Mattson?s language is a delight to read, pure as driven snow. In sum, Snow is quite a minor classic.

 ON FIRE

 The disproportion between cause and consequence is a good measure by which to assess the scale of what has gone wrong. The accidental death in Clichy-sous-Bois of two teenage boys by electrocution as they tried to hide from the police was enough for France to explode with rioting young people. The pathos of the moment lay in its exposure of the irredeemably negative relationship between the police and the multiracial immigrants who live on the estates around the cities. The disdainful comment of the interior minister, Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, helped inflame the passions of a generation which can no longer find place for itself in a country that immigrant forefathers have made their home. France has the largest Muslim population in Europe; most of the ghettoized immigrants are of Algerian, Moroccan and Tunisian origin. Many have an Islamic upbringing, but they all share a sense of exclusion.

 The riots in France have raised the most serious questions about racial integration all over Europe, particularly after the anti-Muslim backlash in the Netherlands and the vandalizing of Muslim cemeteries in Birmingham. France?s official policy of equality erases the particularities of cultural and religious background with the goal of assimilating all comers under republican tenets. In reality though, this works out to be a form of invisibility for ethnic minorities. Even the cities are planned on the basis of an implicit idea of segregation. Although the demand of the rioters is the resignation of Mr Sarkozy, older inhabitants of the estates feel that it is just a token. The problem runs far deeper, into the defiant despair and lack of aspiration of young people who feel that the doors of society are closed to them. Neglect and disrespect are difficult charges to articulate. Crime is easier, as is violence. Violence solves nothing, except achieving a loss of sympathy. It is difficult to say how far political mismanagement has contributed to the violence. It may be helping Mr Sarkozy, who is angling for the right-wing vote in the presidential elections, in which the prime minister, Mr Dominique de Villepin, is an interested party. Minority issues are inextricably tied up with big politics. How France tackles the riots is important to the West. But, ultimately, it is perhaps a model of equal esteem, equal power and equal interaction that has to be made real.

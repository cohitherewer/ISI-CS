 WHOSE CLOSET WILL IT BE TOMORROW?

 Hoaxed!

 The Insider: The Private Diaries of a Scandalous Decade By Piers Morgan, Ebury, ? 10.95

 If Macaulay described the British public in a periodical fit of morality, this book seems to celebrate Britain?s permanent state of levity. A Daily Mirror editor whose adjectival range totters from ?surreal? to ?weird?, pausing en route at ?bizarre?, seems determined to prove Dean Acheson right in saying that Britain had lost an empire without finding a role. But appearances can be deceptive. The Mirror may not have risen to greatness over Iraq if it really had been trivial pursuits all the way. But then, did Piers Morgan publish photographs of British soldiers abusing Iraqi civilians (they turned out to be as untrue as Saddam Hussein?s weapons of mass destruction) because of a moral conviction that it was wrong to invade a sovereign country or because of an insatiable thirst for scoops? 

 Morgan?s excited writing allows us to glimpse a colourful world of tabloid journalism that could not be farther removed from India?s staid press. Not that the comparison is entirely to India?s credit. Morgan?s total absence of pomposity is in stark contrast to the worthies who dominate our Editors Guild. Again, unlike any Indian contemporary, he candidly shares with readers a great deal of information about the times he got it wrong, the occasions when his boss or some dignitary snubbed him, and the things he botched. No qualms either about confessing that he regularly went on drinking binges, abused people, got into fights, and often suffered crippling hangovers. 

 Feelings of superiority about tabloids should be quickly suppressed. Think of the hawkers whose stalls crowd the pavements; or of the commuters packed into local trains. And think of a newspaper that would appeal most to their taste and sensibilities before condemning Morgan for wallowing in Rupert Murdoch?s comment, ?The trouble with Piers is that his balls are bigger than his brains.? Catering to the strata it does, the Daily Mirror is, indeed, the voice of the people. No wonder the world?s movers and shakers queue for its favours. No wonder Morgan?s life is a fast-track whirligig of indiscreet dinners, gossipy lunches, secret conclaves and cryptic telephone conversations. 

 As a brash, cocky, 28-year-old journalist, Morgan was bowled over when invited to meet Murdoch who offered him the editorship of the News of the World on ?125,000 a year. But it was not in Morgan?s nature to be content with titillating the masses only once a week. He had to do it every day. The book opens with the admission that one of his cherished possessions was a postcard from his mother showing a hippo flying with seagulls and the caption, ?Ambition knows no bounds.? He was destined for greater glory. 

 It unfolded one morning of June 1995, over breakfast with David Montgomery, a former NoW editor who had become chief executive of the Mirror Group. The axe fell nine years later when he ran a virulent campaign against the Iraq war and lost thousands of readers. Those faked pictures with explosive captions like ?VILE?but this time it?s a BRITISH soldier degrading an Iraqi? and ?Captive?s Torment? under the telltale boast ?WORLD EXCLUSIVE?, provided the excuse. He was ordered out at once.

 There was also the small matter of buying shares in a company a day before they were tipped by the Mirror share-market experts which Morgan dismisses somewhat casually as an ?unfortunate coincidence?. Since he was investigated but not prosecuted, we must assume he was innocent of insider trading.

 He tells his story in the form of a racy diary with hundreds of bawdy anecdotes, some funny, some profound, some unbelievable ? like Cherie Blair?s conviction that she and her spouse are socialists. Indian readers will be fascinated by the total obsession with the media that grips everyone, from royalty downwards. 

 Morgan doesn?t tell us where the faked pictures came from, the tests he put them through, and why he didn?t apologize when he realized that, although the story was probably true, the evidence was not. A partial apology might have saved his job. 

 But the dinner with the Blairs with which the book ends indicates reconciliation, not just with Number 10 but through that symbol of power, with the world of secret deals, plots and counter-plots which makes one wonder whether the Mirror and Sun hold a mirror up to society or whether society scrambles to fit its media image. A bit of both perhaps. That is understandable in the mother of democracies where everyone can read and write and popular papers are thought to be hugely influential. 

 Total literacy can be a mixed blessing. But if Morgan catered to it by sending a reporter camouflaged as a footman into Buckingham Palace (his ?greatest scoop as an editor?) he also engaged serious liberal columnists like John Pilger and Christopher Hitchens. Adapting the old Northcliffe maxim, he gave the people what they wanted but with lashings of what was good for them.

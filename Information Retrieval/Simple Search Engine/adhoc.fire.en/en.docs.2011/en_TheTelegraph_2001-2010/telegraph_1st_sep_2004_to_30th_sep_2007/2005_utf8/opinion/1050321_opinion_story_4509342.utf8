 Letters to Editor

 Popular historians

 Sir ? While both Rudrangshu Mukherjee (?Style of the historian?, Feb 27) and Ramachandra Guha (?History in a box?, Feb 19) make a fine case for style in history-writing, it is instructive to note the historians they mention. The idea that Simon Schama and Niall Ferguson are connecting with ?the people? requires narrowing that category to a small segment of the Anglo-American population or their elite votaries in the English-speaking world. There are a whole lot of historians and social scientists getting a wider audience at a more fundamental level, say George Chauncey or Christopher Browning or even Carlo Ginsberg. Or say, Basil Davidson, John Iliffe ? all working on Africa. And what about the francophone world? Media and popularity are not always equivalent to BBC and Fox. Such a notion may be useful to Schama and Ferguson for pushing their particular ideology but why would two of the better historians of India confuse that with what is popular?

 Yours faithfully,

Gabbar Singh, Shillong

 Facts of life

 Sir ? Imran Mirza has created a furore by stating his objection to the type of attire women tennis players are required to put on (?Girls in the open?, March 14). There is no doubt that Mirza is wrong to have made his opinion public without taking his daughter into confidence. But it would be unfair to castigate him. As the editorial observes, obscenity lies in the eyes of the beholder. But isn?t the gaze largely directed by our environment and our upbringing? If Mirza finds fault with the mini-skirts and the skin-tight tops his daughter Sania wears, the blame should not be put squarely on his shoulders alone. After all, which father would like to see his daughter?s bare thighs being peered at? Whether the Women?s Tennis Association will have better-clothed women players in the future is another matter. What Papa Mirza can perhaps do is ensure Sania is well-covered.

Yours faithfully, 

Pranab Kumar Saikia, Darrang, Assam 

 Sir ? Nothing succeeds like success. No sooner had Sania Mirza won an international tournament, than she was inundated with lucrative offers for endorsements and granted instant stardom by the media. But is it just her tennis exploits which have made Sania Mirza a darling of the multinationals or her buxom figure, fitted in tight tops and mini-skirts? P.T. Usha had also got international acclaim, but nothing of Sania?s kind happened to her. No wonder Sania?s father, who must have heard offensive comments being made about her, finds the trend disturbing. Sania herself is not free from a sense of guilt. Why else should she vouch for forgiveness from the almighty? Slovak Daniela Hantuchova has been seen sporting a long-sleeved top, why not Sania? On March 9, Sania walked the fashion ramp ? a natural corollary. If all the media hype goes to her head, ? la Anna Kournikova, would it not be a loss for the nation? 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The comments of Sania Mirza?s father about his daughter?s tennis gear is unfortunate. She is an extremely talented tennis star who can do India proud. It will be foolish to bring in narrow religious diktats or views to spoil her career. Sania must be absolutely free to use the attire in which she can give her best performance.

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir ? A fond and responsible father?s concern for his talented and good-looking daughter?s welfare has been wrongly interpreted as an ?unsavoury? exercise of proprietorship over a teenage girl. If one had a grown-up daughter, one would probably be able to sympathize with Imran Mirza. Given the alarming rise in crimes against women, it is only right that parents should take care to see that their wards do not do anything to attract unwanted attention from undesirable quarters. Having seen Bill Tilden, whose name was synonymous with tennis in the early part of the last century, perform magically in her white flannel trousers, I do not think there is any need for present day female tennis stars to wear such skimpy skirts. They are a gimmick staged by the organizers to attract more viewers to the game. 

 Yours faithfully,

C.V.K. Moorthy, Calcutta

 Sir ? If Sania Mirza had to strictly follow the Islamic doctrine, she wouldn?t be competing in the field, leave alone wear skirts. It is for the game that Sania is in her attire. Outside the stadium, she is more decently dressed than any other young, urban Muslim girl. Isn?t it good that Sania should be admitting to being a devout Muslim in today?s society despite attending a modern English-medium school? There wouldn?t have been a controversy had we concentrated on her game instead.

 Yours faithfully,

Jamal Zakaria, Calcutta

 Sir ? There is no doubt that a majority of those who watch tennis appreciate the short skirts of the women players more than their skills. Had any male player emulated Sania Mirza in this respect, there wouldn?t have been such a hoopla. Imran Mirza?s paternal concern at seeing the vulgar commercialization of his daughter is natural and justified.

 Yours faithfully,

Kajal Chatterjee, Sodepur

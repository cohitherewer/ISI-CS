 DIARY

 In the capital, everyone is trying to foretell the chronicle of a cabinet reshuffle. So we have this hilarious story of three Union ministers occupying the front row at a function to inaugurate a Hindi software, attended mostly by newspaper editors. Theirs was a desperate bid to catch the attention of the Congress chief who graced the occasion. There is news of the Congress spokesman, Anand Sharma, camping in a party member?s house in the fervent hope that he is made a minister of state in the MEA. Then there is the story of how the power minister, PM Sayeed, called off a dinner organized for our perpetually hungry scribes and rushed off to 24, Akbar Road to see for himself if people were scheming to push him off his kursi (we don?t know if the expedition bore fruit). There is also news of how the high-profile petroleum minister has been asked to cut short his trip to east Europe and return to Delhi pronto, possibly to negotiate the retention of his double portfolio. All this hurly-burly and foretelling, however, has not affected one man ? K Natwar Singh, who seems to have no intention of returning to Indian shores very soon. But there is also a story here, put forward by the Singh-baiters. Natwar, they say, is consciously avoiding Delhi. That?s one less to talk about. 

 The rise of the Karats is raising many eyebrows, mostly within their own party, and most certainly in Bengal. The last fear the prospect of having to vacate space for the back-door entry of Karat?s favourites from other states. And they definitely fear for their dear Nilotpal Basu, who, they think, may have to finally bid farewell to the Rajya Sabha once his term expires in March next year. But there is also fear in the Congress ranks. Insiders feel that as long as HS Surjeet and Jyoti Basu were there, Sonia had no problems striking a rapport with them. Things like visiting them, seeing them off on trips or serving tea personally were enough to charm them. With Karat, nothing seems to be working. Well!

 The MEA seems to be in need for some media-orientation, as journalists accompanying the president on his recent trip abroad found out. At official banquets and so on, the protocol officer reportedly preferred to interact with only those scribes who had a suffix of ?editor? in their designations. When two senior special correspondents pointed out that they were as worthy of his attention as their other colleagues, the official is supposed to have said that he would not oblige unless designations were either ?sub-editor? or ?copy-editor?.

 The Haryana CM, Bhupinder Singh Huda, is truly flying high. Ever since he got his uran khatola, Huda has supposedly stopped travelling by road. His supporters were amazed and even worried when he, apparently on the advice of his secretaries, decided to go to Mumbai on the state-sponsored plane in search of investment. The journey, which by a regular flight would have taken one-and-half hours, took close to four hours, and yielded, as reports go, a big zero.

 It?s a mini Uttar Pradesh. Delhi?s Meena Bagh area has three neighbours ? Salman Khurshid, Begum Noor Bano and Rajesh Mishra ? all of whom belong to the Congress and are from UP. The problem is that they love to hate each other. Each day, the leaders and their staff allegedly keep a strict vigil on the neighbouring houses and their respective visitors. Which means a lot of trouble for the fence-sitters. If they call on any one leader, the others immediately turn frigid. Hire costumes.

 The new BJP spokesperson, Prakash Javedkar, has no place to stay in Delhi. Someone suggested the BJP MP from Shajapur, T Gehlot, who lived in a sprawling bungalow close to the party headquarters. But when the BJP secretary rang Gehlot, he pleaded helplessness, saying he was himself living in one room (the rest, the grapevine has it, has been rented out). Last heard, a livid Javedkar had prepared a memorandum, asking the party to arrange for the accommodation of poor Gehlot. 

 Poor Rakesh Mohan had hoped to be finance secretary some day. Instead, this secretary in the department of economic affairs has been sent back to the RBI. Has he thanked P Chidambaram?

 It was the National Development Council meet, the annual talkathon that allows our CMs to gauge how well they can read from prepared texts and how fast they can fall asleep. To circumvent this ritual, the PM had insisted that the speeches, which had already been distributed along with background papers in a neat folder at the beginning of the meet, be taken as ?read?. He asked them to ?add or amplify? these speeches. None understood. Dharam Singh, the Karnataka CM, was interrupted, but he continued reading his speech, with a ?Sir, I will not take long.? Meanwhile others like Mulayam Singh Yadav, as the press photos the day after amply showed, decided to steal forty winks. The only ?powerful? presentation came from Narendra Modi, whose claims that Gujarat had registered a growth rate of 15 per cent last year and would repeat the feat this year, got everyone out of their slumber. Hot air, we could say, and plenty of it this time.

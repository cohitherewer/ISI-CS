 Letters to Editor

 State of reversal

 Sir ? The analysis of the Bihar election results in The Telegraph on November 24 (?It?s the arithmetic, silly?) appears to be an exercise in oversimplification. The figures, Lalu+Sonia ? 31.08 per cent and Nitish+Advani ? 35.23 per cent of the total vote share (as it actually happened) and the hypothetical figures of Lalu+Sonia+Paswan ? 44.4 per cent are outright nonsense. How can Ram Vilas Paswan, who was with the BJP only the other day and has been demanding a Muslim chief minister, be considered truly secular, along with the assumption that all the votes polled by him would have gone into the so-called secular kitty? Paswan?s single point agenda was opposing Lalu Prasad, and hence, most of the votes he polled were anti-Lalu votes, not necessarily secular ones. Had he joined hands with Lalu Prasad, in all probability, these votes would have gone to Nitish Kumar?s kitty. In election arithmetic in a country like India, two and two does not always make four. The lead story, the editorial, ?Price of division?, and Sumanta Sen?s oped piece, ?Why the crowned head lies uneasy?, makes one wonder if The Telegraph?s heart is bleeding for Lalu Prasad-Rabri Devi?

 Yours faithfully,

S.B. Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? After the last general elections, the Bihar elections show once again that the Indian voter cannot be taken for granted. At least some credit for the Bharatiya Janata Party-Janata Dal (United) landslide victory should go to Buta Singh, who galvanized the people into some decisive action by negating their February verdict. The Election Commission also rose to the occasion by ensuring a fair elections. Now it is Nitish Kumar?s turn to return the people?s favour by giving them good governance, employment, education and basic amenities. 

 Yours faithfully,

Raghubir Singh, Pune

 Sir ? The election results in Bihar have proved some points. First, a state and its people virtually written off in terms of law and order and civil governance managed to put an end to Lalu Prasad and his wife?s 15-year jungle-raj, with a little help from the EC. Second, the people of the state, including Muslims, have shown that they have no patience for self-important kingmakers like the Lok Janshakti Party leader, Ram Vilas Paswan, playing his Muslim-chief-minister card. Most important, the results showed that the people have the good sense to reject politics based on caste and communal divisions, dynastic ambitions and disempowerment of the poor. Other than the people of the state, perhaps the Congress too will be happy to witness Lalu Prasad?s comeuppance.

 Yours faithfully,

Susenjit Guha, Calcutta

 Sir ? Nitish Kumar, the new chief minister of Bihar, owes some thanks to the state governor, Buta Singh. Had Singh not dissolved the assembly when the last elections threw up a hung assembly, and allowed Nitish Kumar to form a ramshackle government, the JD(U) leader would have been a constantly threatened chief minister now. Nitish Kumar may have been cross with Singh for ignoring his claim to form the government and calling for fresh elections, but now that it has proved to be a blessing in disguise for him and the NDA, how about sending a bunch of roses over to the Raj Bhavan?

 Yours faithfully,

J. Akshobhya, Mysore

 Sir ? The loss of the Rashtriya Janata Dal in Bihar?s second assembly election in less than a year means that Lalu Prasad, Rabri Devi and their family will have to start looking for a new house. Of course, Nitish Kumar may be gracious enough to let them stay on. The emotional attachment of the rather extended former first family to building no. 1 on Anne Marg is understandable, especially of the two younger sons who used the sprawling lawns for their cricket practice. We will soon know whether Nitish Kumar travels the path shown by Alexander and lets the vanquished keep his spoils.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The 15-year rule of Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi has finally come to an end. Bihar had become synonymous with the bad governance of the duo. Although it is well-known that the couple never did much for the poor in the state, still it does feel a trifle sad to watch them go. It is the same feeling which came over many in West Bengal when Jyoti Basu relinquished his post.

 Yours faithfully,

Nandini Saraf, Calcutta

 Sir ? If Lalu Prasad?s misrule can finally be rejected by the people of Bihar, then why can?t the same treatment be given to the Marxist-raj in West Bengal? The answer lies in the cadre-strength of the communist parties, which remains unmatched by any other party in India. In West Bengal, the Left Front will remain in power till the opposition parties, together or alone, can build up their cadre-force. But the opposition parties lack that vision and let the long-term goal to be obstructed by petty personal considerations. Bihar showed this time that a pseudo-disciplined cadre-based party can walk over a party whose victory had been taken for granted. Bihar has done it, when will Bengal?

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The blatantly partisan role played by the English language media during the recently concluded Bihar elections was downright shameful. It is well known that ?neutrality? is a word which is absent from the lexicon of the editors of our major English dailies. However, what was more disturbing was the fact that most of these papers started acting like campaign managers of the NDA as Bihar moved closer towards the elections. Since the English language media is dominated by the upper castes (I cannot think of an accredited Dalit journalist working for any of the English dailies or major news channels), the bias hardly comes as a surprise. I am no admirer of Lalu Prasad, but it?s disturbing to watch the media descending to such pits.

 Yours faithfully,

Ashokankur Datta, New Delhi

 Sir ? Lalu Prasad must be feeling terrible away from Bihar. Will Nitish Kumar please appoint him as his court jester? 

 Yours faithfully,

Mitul Chakraborty, Calcutta

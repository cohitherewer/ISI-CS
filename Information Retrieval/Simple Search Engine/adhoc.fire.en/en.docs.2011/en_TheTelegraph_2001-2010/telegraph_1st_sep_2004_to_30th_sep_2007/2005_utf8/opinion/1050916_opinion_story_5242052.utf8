 DEEP END OF THE ABYSS

 Malvika Singh

 How wrong our priorities are! Departments of government are in a state of perpetual distraction with either pandering to the needs of that strange breed called VIPs or ?exposing? their misdemeanours. This minuscule species should be ignored and treated as an aberration. Over the decades, this type has become a nuisance in the public space, an embarrassment for all those who understand the definition of dignity and graciousness and who would want to live by those values. The VIPs of today are crass and brash. They represent everything that is wrong and distasteful about our contemporary society. 

 The demand for the trappings that accompany most VIPs was non-existent in the early years of this nation. The posture then was civilized and appropriate. Leaders were seen as respected ?heroes?. Greed has overwhelmed those who rule India, be they politicians or administrators. Those who bend their own rules to ?accommodate? various nefarious activities are the same people who are sent to ?investigate? when the activities are exposed in the public domain. The situation we live in is farcical and ludicrous, to say the least. 

 It is disturbing to raise a new generation of Indians in this sordid atmosphere where corruption suffocates decent living and clean ethics. Real life in India today makes a mockery of all faiths and religions, of ancestor worship, of norms that govern community life. We are the finest example of that civil breakdown. The young are growing up in the belief that bribes, to take one example, are an intrinsic part of living. Definitions have changed as we plunge into the deep end of an unending dark abyss at a time when the rest of the world is moving on. 

 Kill corruption

 The tragedy is that the ?government? and its administrators, who consolidated corruption, also run about bringing more and more restriction on the people of India in a bid to show that they have begun to fight the disease. However, we all know that added restrictions only enlarge the corruption arena ? more government representatives knocking for more money, and if you are honest and do not fall prey to their demands for a bribe, they ensnare you with ?interpretations? of the so-called law. It has become a scandal of enormous proportion but the leadership of India, which knows this to be the absolute truth, continues to ignore this cancer. Why? Is it because this malafide use of corrupt practices allows them to live comfortably in their ivory towers for a short while longer? Or are they just plain ignorant with an intellectual lacuna that has made them into unidentifiable moving objects, who do not merit ruling this nation? 

 ?Kill Corruption? should be the one point agenda of Manmohan Singh?s tenure. Because he himself is scrupulously honest, he can compel his government employees to follow their leader. Charity begins at home remains an appropriate clich?. If they, the once-upon-a-time steel frame of India, do not alter their habit, they should be hurled into a suspension box, indefinitely. Let them not strangle India and the Indian people any more. Release this indignity from our everyday lives. The less we have of unprincipled bureaucrats and their irregular functioning, the faster India will grow and prosper. This unacceptable baggage must be discarded and the process must begin post-haste.

 If this government does not address this demon, every bill that it wants to put through parliament, that are intended for the uplift of the under privileged, will become yet another stage for the continuing acts of money-making and rampant corruption. They will reduce the marginal peoples to a state of penury. Can they not see this? Or, is everything vote-motivated? And if that be the case, the beneficiaries will be the many mafias that tyrannize Bharat and India.

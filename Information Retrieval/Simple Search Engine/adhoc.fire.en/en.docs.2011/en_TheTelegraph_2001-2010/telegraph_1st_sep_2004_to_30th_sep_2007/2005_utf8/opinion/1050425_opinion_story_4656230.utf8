 UNSAFE HAVENS

 The safety of senior citizens in their own homes ? whose concern should this be? The brutal murder of Tara Chand and Sarda Banka in their flat in the heart of upper-middle-class Calcutta provides an occasion to think about the problem again. They were ?murdered for gain? by their domestic help, most probably with the assistance of at least two more people. This happened in a multi-storied apartment, where a similar crime was committed a few years ago. There have been enough of these crimes over the last few years for the police to notice a definite ?trend? ? although it is time its efforts went beyond trend-spotting. Yet, such a problem can only be tackled through a community-based approach. First, the question of identity cards for domestic helps. The idea was launched a year ago by the Shakespeare Sarani police station, but the double inertia of the police as well as the citizens who were to benefit from the idea ensured its natural demise. Such a scheme, together with the maintaining of details of domestics in the local po- lice stations, can only work through two-way cooperation. 

 On the part of the police, an efficient country-wide checking system and database are the only way in which facts provided by the domestics and their helpers may be ascertained. For instance, every bit of information that the Bankas? help provided them with was false. Yet he belonged to a network of migrants from Jharkhand and Bihar which included domestics, security guards and drivers, and no doubt other workers as well. Keeping track of this elusive network may be a difficult task for the police. The emergence of the nuclear family is an important context to the fragility of the elderly in urban India. Yet it is possible for multi-storeyed buildings and neighbourhoods to form humane vigilance networks specially adapted to the needs of the elderly. Developing burglar alarm links with police stations should also be considered. Efficient and considerate community-based policing, together with the raising of citizen awareness and initiative, is the best solution.

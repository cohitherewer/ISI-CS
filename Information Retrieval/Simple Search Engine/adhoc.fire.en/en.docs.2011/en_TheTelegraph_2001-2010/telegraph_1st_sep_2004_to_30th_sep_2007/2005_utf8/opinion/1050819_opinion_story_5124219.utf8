 RICH TRADITION OF REASONING

 Native wisdom

 The Argumentative Indian: WRITINGS 

 FROM 

 INDIAN HISTORY, CULTURE AND IDENTITY

 By Amartya Sen, 

 Allen Lane, Rs 650

 An argument, like an army, marches 

 on its stomach. This is one reason why Amartya Sen, in many 

 of his writings, has tried to bring together reason and 

 welfare. In this collection of essays, the thrust, as the 

 name of the book suggests, is towards reason and reasoning. 

 This thrust comes out of a particular context. Sen tries 

 to retrieve an aspect of Indian culture and tradition from 

 the prevailing notions about India in the West and the persistent 

 propaganda about Indian culture by the Hindutva brigade.

 Sen presents to his readers a tradition of arguing and reasoning in India that goes back to the Vedic times and has been an intrinsic part of Indian culture and identity. The point is important because the West has always had a propensity to exoticize India as a land of religion and spirituality. This helped it to rule India and to treat it as a subject of curatorial interest. This tradition of argument and ratiocination had within it immense diversity, and perhaps it may be erroneous to call it one uniform tradition. The plurality of reason was a very important feature of the history of arguments in India. Radical doubt, rather than a quest for certainty, was a significant, if neglected strand of Indian philosophy and thought. 

 This doubt was expressed as early as the Rig Veda where we read in the ?song of creation?: ?Whence this creation has arisen ? perhaps it formed itself, or perhaps it did not ? the one who looks down on it, in the highest heaven, only he knows ? or perhaps he does not know.? We are perpetually in Sen?s debt for retrieving this strand in all its complexity and plurality and with such lucidity. The persistent scepticism about an all-encompassing Truth perhaps sets apart the argumentative Indian tradition from the Enlightenment which believed that through reason it was possible to arrive at Truth.

 Dialogue was an integral part of Indian reasoning. This brought to it a democratic dimension. Even absolutist monarchs like Ashoka and Akbar participated in debate and discussion. This gave rise to toleration. Ashoka emphasized the need to conduct arguments with ?restraint regard to speech? and said that the ?sects of other people deserve reverence?. Akbar pronounced that ?no man should be interfered with on account of religion?. Sen could have added that even Aurangzeb had announced ?To him is his religion, to me is mine.?

 Against this history of reason, toleration and democracy, Sen shows up the highly miniaturized version of Indian culture and history that the advocates of Hindutva dole out. It equates Hindu with India, and glosses over the diversity that exists within the Hindu tradition. It also ignores the non-Hindu contribution to Indian culture. It reduces the idea of India. Sen demonstrates the contradictions inherent in such an idea and argues in favour of a ?capacious? idea of India.

 Sen draws on philosophy, history, science and literature to make his points. The rigour of his exposition and the range of his learning make him the most important argumentative Indian of our times. We learn from him how to argue and what to argue about.

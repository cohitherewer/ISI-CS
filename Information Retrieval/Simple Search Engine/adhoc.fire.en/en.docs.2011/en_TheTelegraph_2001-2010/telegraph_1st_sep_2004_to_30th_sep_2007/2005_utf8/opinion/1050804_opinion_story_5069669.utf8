 MORE OF A MESS

 It is no easy task to clean up the mess in Bihar. But much of what the governor, Mr Buta Singh, has been doing seems to be complicating matters. The controversy over the transfer of senior police and civil officers is only a manifestation of his inept handling of things. The decision of the state?s chief secretary, Mr G.S. Kang, to go on leave in protest against the governor?s action reflects the bureaucracy?s loss of confidence in the latter?s style of functioning. The signs cannot be good for a state where the administration is not particularly effective anyway. A conflict between the governor and the bureaucracy will be disappointing for the common people who had hoped for a better deal during president?s rule. Bihar?s politicians have failed the people. Many of them have colluded with criminals and greedy bureaucrats to create a perpetual state of fear. The governor?s indiscretions could have a destabilizing effect on the whole administration. All this calls for a fresh look into the powers of a governor. It must be a bizarre system that leaves important matters of state to the ?discretion? of an individual. 

 President?s rule is an interregnum between democratic rules. Legally and otherwise, its only purpose is to set the stage for the elections. Given the law and order situation in the state and the criminalization of its politics, Mr Buta Singh could at least make an honest beginning in getting things back on track. He has apparently done little to this effect. Hence, the Election Commission?s complaint that nothing had been done to initiate action against hundreds of criminals masquerading as politicians. The EC cannot directly influence the administration until the notification for the assembly elections is issued. It has, therefore, asked the administration not to transfer officers involved in election-related work without its permission. This is clearly the EC?s way of protesting against the governor?s decision on the transfers. Mr Singh has done no good to his office; nor is he helping the cause of cleaner polls in Bihar.

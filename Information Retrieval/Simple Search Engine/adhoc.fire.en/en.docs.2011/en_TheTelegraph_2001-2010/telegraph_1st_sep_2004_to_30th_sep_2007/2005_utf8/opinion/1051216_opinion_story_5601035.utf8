 NOT THE STIFF UPPER LIP KIND

 Great British Wit By Rosemarie Jarski, 

 Ebury ? 4.75

 The British take their humour very seriously. The emergence of political correctness that blights fun and jokes has not been able to kill, thank god, the British sense of humour.

 That sense of humour has three principal characteristics: an ability to laugh at oneself, irony and word play. But any follower of the British sense of humour would add two other ancillary features: understatement and an enviable ability to revel in silliness for its own sake. From Shakespeare to Oscar Wilde to P.G. Wodehouse to Yes, Prime Minister to Blackadder ? the list is long and the type of humour inexhaustible.

 In this book, Rosemarie Jarski brings together some of the classic one-liners and comments which illustrate the British sense of humour which is articulated in anything between a quiet and almost inaudible chuckle to a hearty guffaw.

 Every reader who dips into this volume will have his or her own favourites. To take a random selection. ?Originality is undetected plagiarisms?. Sounds like Wilde but was uttered by Dean Inge. The comedian, Ronnie Barker, a master of the art of double entendre, defined it thus: ?The great thing about double entendre is that it can only mean one thing.?? An award winning example of double entendre could be the following: ?On the mantlepiece in my parlour I?ve got a whole row of silver cups. They?re for my pussy. Do you know, it wins a prize every time I show it!? It was uttered in the TV serial Are you being served? by Mrs Slocombe.

 For a piece of supreme punning, here is a conversation: ??You have a daughter, I believe?? ??Yeah, yeah, Henrietta.?? ?? Did he, did he? I?m sorry to hear that.?

 A Brit, the story goes, was once asked, ?Where would you be without a sense of humour?? He answered, ?In Germany.? One could place that witticism next to the following from Blackadder Goes Forth: ? ? Me, a German spy? I?m as British as Queen Victoria!? ?? So your father?s German, you?re half German, and you married a German.?

 The most memorable understatement came, of course, from Captain Oates who, while walking out to his death, told his colleagues in the tent: ?I?m going out. I will be gone for a while.? A vintage cartoon once depicted two Britons on top of Matterhorn admiring the view. ?Not bad,? says one. ?No,? says the other, ?but you needn?t rave about it like a love-struck poet.?

 The put-down and the insult have become associated with the wit of Winston Churchill. Who can forget the line, ?Clement Attlee is a modest man, he has much to be modest about.?? But equally unforgettable is Margot Asquith?s snub to Jean Harlow. The latter asked, ?How is Margot pronounced?? The reply was, ?The T is silent, same as in Harlow.?

 This book has many such memorable moments. Too many in fact. Buy it, keep it by your bedside and dip into it whenever your funny bone giggles. It hurts when I larf.

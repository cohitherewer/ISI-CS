 DISADVANTAGES OF BEING BORN POOR 

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the Human Development Report 2005

 Income inequalities interact with other life chance inequalities. Being born into a poor household diminishes life chances, in some cases in a literal sense. Children born into the poorest 20 per cent of households in Ghana or Senegal are 2-3 times more likely to die before age 5 than children born into the richest 20 per cent of households... Poor women are less likely to be educated and less likely to receive ante-natal care when they are pregnant. Their children are less likely to survive and less likely to complete school, perpetuating a cycle of deprivation that is transmitted across generations... Health outcomes in the United States, the world?s richest country, reflect deep inequalities based on wealth and race. 

 Regional disparities are another source of inequality. Human development faultlines separate rural from urban and poor from rich regions of the same country. In Mexico, literacy rates in some states are comparable to those in high-income countries. In the predominantly rural indigenous municipalities of southern poverty belt states like Guerrero, literacy rates for women approximate those in Mali.

 Gender is one of the world?s strongest markers for disadvantage. This is especially the case in south Asia. The large number of ?missing women? in the region bears testimony to the scale of the problem. Disadvantage starts at birth. In India, the death rate for children ages 1-5 is 50 per cent higher for girls than for boys. Expressed differently, 130,000 young lives are lost each year because of the disadvantage associated with being born with two X chromosomes. In Pakistan, gender parity in school attendance would give 2 million more girls the chance of an education.

 Reducing inequality in the distribution of human development opportunities is a public policy priority in its own right: it matters for intrinsic reasons. It would also be instrumental in accelerating progress towards the millennium development goals. Closing the gap in child mortality between the richest and poorest 20 per cent would cut child deaths by almost two-thirds, saving more than 6 million lives a year ? and putting the world back on track for achieving the MDG target of a two-thirds reduction in child death rates.

 More equitable income distribution would act as a strong catalyst for accelerated poverty reduction. We use household income and expenditure surveys to simulate the effect of a growth pattern in which people in poverty capture twice the share of future growth as their current share in national income. For Brazil, this version of pro-poor growth shortens the time horizon for halving poverty by 19 years; for Kenya, by 17 years. 

 The conclusion: when it comes to income poverty reduction, distribution matters as well as growth. That conclusion holds as much for low-income countries as for middle-income countries. Without improved income distribution sub-Saharan Africa would require implausibly high growth rates to halve poverty by 2015. It might be added to this consideration that a demonstrated commitment to reduce inequality as part of a wider poverty reduction strategy would enhance the case for aid among the public in donor countries.

 Scaling up national simulation exercises using a global income distribution model highlights the potential benefits of reduced inequality for global poverty reduction. Using such a model, we ask what would happen if people living on less than $1 a day were to double their share of future growth. The result: a decline of one-third ? or 258 million people ? in the projected number of people living on less than $1 a day by 2015.

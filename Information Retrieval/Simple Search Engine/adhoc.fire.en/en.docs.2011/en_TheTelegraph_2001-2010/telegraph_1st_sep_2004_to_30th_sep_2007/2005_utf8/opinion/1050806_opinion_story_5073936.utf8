 Letters to Editor

 Cramped and chaotic

 Sir ? The report, ?Tiers aloft to ease traffic? (July 27), claims that a major reason for Calcutta?s traffic woes is that roads constitute only 6 per cent of available space. How authentic is this figure? If 6 per cent was the figure in 1965, it will definitely be higher now with the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, the flyovers with space beneath and the widening of many roads after narrowing the footpaths. Instead of blaming poor traffic conditions on little roadspace, the authorities would be better served if they find out how much is the actual available road space. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Raj Bagri, Calcutta

 Tit for tat

 Sir ? Sentiments like the one voiced in the editorial, ?The fall? (July 26) ? ?terror can only be countered by terror? ? are potentially dangerous. This is the logic terrorists resort to in order to justify their use of violence to counter the state. Such sentiments can only lead to disaster. Killing a man can only be justified if it is done to prevent further loss of life. Of course, the police can make mistakes, which is pardonable. But in the case of Jean Charles de Menezes, it is plain that he was over-powered by the London police even though they had no evidence of his being a threat. The policemen who shot him were nothing but cold-blooded murderers. 

 In India, policemen wielding the lathi on cowering citizens is a common sight from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, from Gujarat to Imphal. Without doubt, it is this police high-handedness which has led to the rise of the Naxalites, the Ulfa and other such extremist groups. In much the same way, al Qaida was born in reaction to US depredations. 

 Yours faithfully,

P. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? While it is true that ?the use of terror by the police cannot be as indiscriminate as that of the fanatics? (?The fall?), the British police did repeatedly ask Jean Charles de Menezes to stop and raise his hands. The police cannot take chances in such encounters because if the man were a human bomb, it would mean certain death for the chasers. During the Emergency in India, monstrosities of a far worse nature were perpetrated without any rhyme or reason.

 If caught, the terrorist as well as those who aid and abet him should be tried in a fast-track court and given harsh sentences. The onus of proving innocence must rest with the accused, because the police ? hampered by squeamish witnesses ? can hardly prove charges in conformity with the Evidence Act. No appeal to higher courts should be allowed. Such provisions should remain till the threat to citizens and the state is alive. 

 Yours faithfully,

Banikumar Banerjee, Madhyamgram

 Prime movers

 Sir ? Prime time yesterday was a hectic one for television watchers, what with Amitabh Bachchan?s Kaun Banega Crorepati making a comeback on Star Plus and Jassi getting married to Arman in Sony Television?s Jassi Jaisi Koi Nahi. We?ll have to wait a while to know which channel came up trumps, but one thing can be said for sure ? the viewers were the ultimate winners.

 Yours faithfully,

Bhaskar Pratap Swain, Cuttack

 Sir ? The second coming of Amitabh Bachchan?s KBC is no better; it is full of gimmicks and the questions are as easy. I think, Shabana Azmi would make a far better host than Bachchan. Also, the show could do with some more features. For example, the first question should have no options and only 30 seconds should be given to answer it. The use of lifelines would mean a reduction in the prize money. Also, the anchor should not give any clues ? either to help or to mislead.

 Yours faithfully, 

 S.S. Almal, Calcutta

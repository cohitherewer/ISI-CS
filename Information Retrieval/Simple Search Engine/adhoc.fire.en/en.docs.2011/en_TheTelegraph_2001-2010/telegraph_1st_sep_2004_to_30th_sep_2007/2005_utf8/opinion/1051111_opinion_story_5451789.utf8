 Letters to Editor

 High thinking

 Sir ? Ramachandra Guha makes a disguised pro tanto distinction between Mao Zedong and Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (?Helmsman and boatman?, Oct 15). He is right in observing that Gandhi?s unflinching adherence to ahimsa set him apart from other thinkers of his time and after. Chairman Mao, on the other hand, believed that the gun yielded political power, and did not hesitate to use it on his own people. But Mao and Gandhi have left strikingly similar legacies. And both have been quietly forgotten in their countries. Today?s China does not belong to Mao but to Deng Xiaoping. Similarly, today?s India is largely Nehru?s, not Gandhi?s. Hardliners in the Chinese Communist Party, and staunch Gandhian social activists who remain at the fringes of mainstream politics, both harp on the good old days under their helmsman. While Gandhi had a formidable rival, Mohammed Ali Jinnah, who managed to spoil his dream of a united India, Mao too had Chiang Kai-Shek, who took control of Taiwan and kept it independent of the mainland. 

 As Guha mentions, both Gandhi and Mao were advocates of social equality. Gandhi forced his own orthodox wife to clean latrines, and Mao, during the Cultural Revolution in China, enforced mass deportation of intellectuals to countryside communes. The crucial difference between the two is that while Gandhi never tried to transform dissent into submission, Mao did. Perhaps that explains the fundamental structural differences between contemporary Indian and Chinese society.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? It is noteworthy that both Mahatma Gandhi and Mao Zedong, in spite of following two different ideologies, gave up comfort for the sake of the common man. Both were pragmatic thinkers who set off new trends in politics. However, Gandhi?s firm belief in the supremacy of god and his strong advocacy of non-violence stood in sharp contrast to Mao?s beliefs and political methods. Ironically, both contemporary India and China, giving way to global forces, have deviated from the vision of their architects. Today, the pains of the common man have no relevance to others amid the chaos of modern times. The emergence of global giants is proving to be a dangerous development for ordinary life in both the nations. People are eagerly awaiting the reappearance of stalwarts who can save them from ruin and restore their faith in higher ideals.

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad

 Sir ? Ramachandra Guha shrinks from saluting Mao for what he calls the accumulated proof of his misdeeds. But does Mao?s strong-arm tactics, followed by innumerable other figures in history, completely overwrite his achievements? And can we really say that Gandhi has been entirely ethical in his political practices?

 Yours faithfully,

Jayanta Sikdar, Calcutta

 Bovine matters

 Sir ? A seven-judge bench of the Supreme Court recently upheld the Gujarat government?s ban on the slaughter of cows, bulls and bullocks aged more than sixteen years (?Bovine killing ban upheld?, Oct 27). The judgment was delivered on grounds that the Constitution allows ?reasonable restrictions? to be imposed on the fundamental rights of citizens, in this case, the right to engage in any profession. The judges, reportedly, based their opinion on Article 51 A(g) which says that every citizen should have compassion for ?all animals?. Unfortunately, history bears witness to the fact that Indians have hardly had much ?compassion?. In The Myth of the Holy Cow by D.N. Jha, Buddha is evinced to have had pork as part of his last meal. The Taittiriya Brahmana says, ?Verily the cow is food.? So much for the myth that India was a land of ahimsa before the advent of Muslims. Our judges should note that if there are ?reasonable restrictions? on fundamental rights, there should also be similar restrictions on the fundamental duties of Indians. Incidentally, neither the government, especially Gujarat?s, nor the judiciary seem particularly bothered by the lack of compassion shown to the people slaughtered during the Gujarat violence. Does the said fundamental duty not apply to human beings because they are not animals? 

 Yours faithfully,

Meher Engineer, Calcutta

 Sir ? Judgments delivered by the judiciary defeat the principles of logic at times. It is unbelievable that in a diverse country like India, slaughter of cows is banned in most states, barring a few sensible ones like West Bengal and Kerala. Why should one be deprived of the right to choose one?s food or profession just to appease unjustified Hindu sentiments? 

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

 Letters to Editor

 On slippery surface

 Sir ? When we read about the scams and scandals involving our veteran politicians, it makes us wonder if Indian democracy is really about a government of the people, for the people or by the people. If the Volcker report has now exposed K. Natwar Singh as a beneficiary of the oil-for-food programme, the Mitrokhin papers cast similar doubts about other stalwarts in the Congress and the undivided Communist Party of India. Not long before that we had another veteran, George Fernandes, running for cover in the Tehelka expos?. And, of course, the Bofors guns threaten to boom every now and then. 

 Natwar Singh?s reluctance to step down even after the ignominy of losing the portfolio is perhaps indicative of the same unabashed venality that guides our politicians. The framers of the Constitution possibly had no idea that our political leaders would stoop so low. A small allowance was therefore earmarked for them as honorarium for the public service they would render. For all intents and purposes, we live in an oligarchy, or call it a plutocracy or aristocracy. It is anything but democracy.

 Yours faithfully,

P.K. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is again a sad day for Indians. When the white man stands up, Indians cannot but prostrate before him. So true or not, Paul Volcker?s allegations have to be accepted as the cardinal truth. But if Saddam Hussein is a bunch of lies, as the West thinks he is, how can the data he recorded be accepted as beyond question? Moreover, the report itself, a product of the worst form of international politicking, cannot be accepted as being untainted. But while countries across the world haven?t moved a muscle following the report, India, pious as ever, has dropped a minister. Was there any need for this? K. Natwar Singh should have been allowed to continue, perhaps maintain a low profile, till the investigation was over. This approach would have shown India as a strong emerging power, which cannot be sullied easily. But the manner in which Singh?s guilt is being presumed by all and sundry raises serious doubts about whether the latter owe their allegiance to India or to powers beyond its shores. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Kamat, Alto Porvorim, Goa

 Sir ? As expected, the Congress continues to shield the corrupt and inefficient. Which is why, despite being stripped of his portfolio, Natwar Singh, continues to remain minister in the government. The Congress has reigned for a majority of India?s post-independence years, and given the country a string of leaders with progressively declining calibre and grace. Yet, neither the party, nor its members, seem to have the slightest bit of remorse. A resignation would not have made Natwar Singh a saint, but gone a long way in salvaging the image of the party.

 Yours faithfully,

S.P. Sharma, Mumbai

 Sir ? The removal of K. Natwar Singh from the ministry of external affairs shows that the Bharatiya Janata Party has certainly played its cards right. The Congress would have definitely got a taste of its own medicine had Singh been allowed to hold on. The party had once come down heavily on the BJP following the Tehelka probe. The Volcker report has certainly opened up a hornets? nest. And there will be other heads that will roll in the coming days. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sumant Poddar, Calcutta 

 Sir ? As a career diplomat, K. Natwar Singh should have shown more finesse in handling the Volcker report allegations. But the defiant stand he took initially and the rather tame withdrawal from the MEA have shown him in poor light. As successive editorials have noted in The Telegraph, people in high office should ?appear? to be fair at least. Why are the elites like Natwar Singh so eager to push the interests of their sons and daughters? Why don?t politicians any longer have the moral courage like Lal Bahadur Shastri, who resigned his railway minister?s job the moment there was a major accident? 

 Yours faithfully,

R.B. Easwaran, Chennai

 Sir ? While, undoubtedly, Manmohan Singh is an honest person, a good economist and a nationalist, he has not displayed political acumen in handling the Volcker report allegations against both K. Natwar Singh and the Congress. Moreover, Singh should not have been relieved of his ministry as the charges against him have in no way been substantiated. Unfortunately, what this development demonstrates is that charges framed (or fabricated) can enable foreigners to unsettle India politically.

 Yours faithfully,

Vimla Raje, London

 Sir ? There have been more serious allegations against the son of Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary-general, and more substantial proof than against K. Natwar Singh. But Annan was neither forced to step down nor hounded in the manner Natwar Singh has been. Singh has merely been cut down to size by his own partymen. 

 Yours faithfully

Sushant, Calcutta

 Sir ? Manmohan Singh has displayed double standards in the current Volcker controversy. On the one hand, he has come down heavily against Natwar Singh, and yet he has been alleging that nobody in his party is involved in the oil-for-food scandal. 

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, 

 Jamshedpur

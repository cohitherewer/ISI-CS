 HOW MUSHARRAF STOLE THE SHOW

 Twenty-Twenty / Bharat Bhushan

 Hurriyat leaders with Pakistan?s minister for Kashmir affairs

 On June 1, a day before their departure to Muzaffarabad, six of the seven All Party Hurriyat Conference leaders going to Pakistan received an unexpected bonanza. Yasin Malik, Abdul Ghani Butt, Abbas Ansari, Yaqub Wakil, G.M. Butt, Abdullah Tari and Fazal-ul-Haq Qureshi were given Indian passports with one-year validity. Except Yasin Malik, none of them had applied for an Indian passport earlier ? they were urged to fill up the passport application forms and short-circuiting normal procedure, were given a proof of Indian citizenship within 24-hours.

 However, General Pervez Musharraf has denied India the fig leaf of the passports. Pakistan has flown the Hurriyat leaders out of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir ? a disputed territory ? into Islamabad, without either stamping the passports or issuing them visas. India is unable to do anything as it had originally sanctioned visa-free travel to PoK to enable Kashmiris to take the special bus route between Muzaffarabad and Srinagar.

 General Musharraf reminded the world that this visa-less and passport-less travel by the Kashmiri leaders to Pakistan (not PoK) was ?the recognition of the disputed status of India-held Kashmir by both the countries?. Mark his words. The whole of the erstwhile princely state of Jammu and Kashmir is not disputed ? POK is not disputed, according to the General and nor are Gilgit and Baltistan. Only that part of Kashmir that is in India is disputed.

 This stinging slap must embarrass those in New Delhi who rushed with forcibly offering passports to the Hurriyat leaders. But this will not be the end of their woes as several other questions remain.

 Having issued the passports, will India now allow the Hurriyat leaders to use these documents to apply for visas to the UK or US, for example? Or, as is likely, would it impound their passports when they seek to travel abroad the next time? What kind of a commentary would that be on Indian democracy? And what does the flip-flop on the Hurriyat crossing over to Pakistan say about India?s Kashmir policy? The fact is that India does not have a Kashmir policy that goes beyond pumping money and security forces into Jammu and Kashmir. There are three things that Musharraf seeks to do with the Hurriyat visit to Pakistan. One, he wants to demonstrate to the world his sincerity in addressing the Kashmir issue. Two, he wants to transform the Hurriyat into the third party that represents the Kashmiris in the dispute, while India insists that it is a bilateral issue between India and Pakistan. And three, as it becomes relatively more difficult to use terrorism as the main instrument of his Kashmir policy, Musharraf wants to create a proxy political force in Indian Kashmir in the form of the Hurriyat.

 India should have been talking to its Kashmiris but it has nothing to say to them. It is pointless describing some Hurriyat members as ?moderates? and others as ?extremists? if New Delhi is unable to make use of this fine analytical political difference among the separatists.

 Contrast this what Pakistan has done. Islamabad used the extremist Syed Ali Shah Geelani when it suited Pakistan and then junked him in favour of the moderate Mirwaiz Umer Farooq. The Mirwaiz was forced to fall in line by Pakistan using both the leverage of money (directly paid to him) and fear ? assassinating his uncle when the Mirwaiz met L.K. Advani and setting fire to the family?s Islamiya School.

 It should be clear by now that Musharraf is single-mindedly pursuing a Kashmir solution on Pakistan?s terms outwitting India at every step. Why did Pakistan want the Hurriyat leaders to cross over from PoK to Pakistan? The propaganda reason may have been to tell the Kashmiris that Pakistan is their own country and they do not need visas and passports to travel within it. But the primary political reason was different.

 Musharraf needs the Hurriyat to get the endorsement within his own country for the ostensible change in his Kashmir policy. Pakistan needs the Hurriyat leaders in Islamabad to interact with their maulanas and political leaders. It wants to show the internal political leadership that the Kashmiris themselves want a solution and that this solution may be at variance with their ?Kashmir banega Pakistan? dream but it may still be in favour of Pakistan.

 So the ladder that was used to escalate the crisis is now being also used to climb down ? Pakistan created the Hurriyat to raise the temperature in Kashmir and now it is also its instrument for finding a solution on its own terms.

 Ideally, Pakistan would have liked the Hurriyat to reunite. But since its one-time prot?g?, Geelani, has refused to recognize the change in the direction of the wind, it has had no qualms in junking him. Pakistan is shifting its patronage to those who have the potential to occupy the broadest possible political ground in Kashmir. If that happens, then Pakistan would have all the cards ? a calibrated use of the gun would support the proxy political formation of the Hurriyat in Jammu and Kashmir.

 Musharraf is aware that India will not jettison the constitutional forces represented by the People?s Democratic Party, the National Conference and others in favour of the Hurriyat without an election. Therefore, he is readying the Hurriyat to participate in political processes in Kashmir, culminating in an election.

 Although the Hurriyat leaders have no mass base, the domestic political forces in Jammu and Kashmir will find it difficult to oppose them. The Kashmiris will think that the Hurriyat alone can get them something more than what they already have under the Mufti Mohammad Sayeed government ? it may not be independence but could be greater autonomy or a semi-sovereign status. 

 After the return of the Hurriyat leaders from Pakistan, therefore, Kashmir is unlikely to see tranquillity ? there could be heightened political activity and mass agitations for the withdrawal of the Indian armed forces. These agitations may ultimately lead to demanding early elections in Kashmir.

 India, therefore, needs to seriously rethink its attitude to the Hurriyat and its Kashmir policy. The only good thing that has happened as far as India is concerned is that Geelani did not go to Pakistan and the Hurriyat remains divided. Perhaps New Delhi should stop chasing the Hurriyat for talks after its return from Pakistan and let them cool their heels for violating the agreement of the Muzaffarabad-Srinagar bus service. Its emphasis should be on respecting the people?s will in Kashmir and not Pakistan?s desires.

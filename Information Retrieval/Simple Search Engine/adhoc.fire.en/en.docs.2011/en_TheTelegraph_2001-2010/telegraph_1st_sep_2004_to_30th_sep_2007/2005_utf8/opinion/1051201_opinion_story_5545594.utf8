 NOT THE REAL THING

 Neha Sahay

 For expats, China seems one of the safest places to live in, especially after 9/11. Religious identity and race are hardly issues here, unless you want to preach and convert.

 As for day-to-day living, those who don?t need to go into the interior find China?s cities very liveable indeed, specially the newly created ones in the South. Transport, sanitation, power, water supply: there?s little really to complain about, even for those foreigners who can?t afford a five-star lifestyle and those who choose to step outside their air-conditioned cocoons. But the benzene leak has suddenly made life in China very risky. Harbin is no small town. If such a major disaster can happen in a provincial capital, water everywhere looks unsafe.

 No one in China?s cities drinks tap water. Drinking water is a commodity, with a 20-litre container costing 13 yuan. Many Chinese prefer to take water straight from the springs in the mountains, a time consuming, tiring affair, now being banned in some places. Now, one wonders whether the mineral water on sale is safe. Suddenly, all the things we take for granted seem full of hidden dangers.

 Bad mix

 Is cooking oil safe, for example? The packaging is so good, one wouldn?t suspect a thing. Besides, there?s the ISO 9000 label to reassure you, till your local mentor informs you these certificates can be bought. Take milk for instance. An amazing variety of milk is available in a country which has traditionally shunned it. Here, even your mentor is no help; the milk he certifies as fresh, turns out to be suspiciously watery. 

 Yoghurt is gaining popularity now, with a few international brands available. But the cheapest varieties consumed by most people are cloyingly sweet and actually taste of chemicals. What about soaps and shampoos? Again, they seem okay, till you read a brief in China Daily about a woman suing a beauty parlour for using a shampoo that turned her bald.

 Many of India?s products are probably as contaminated as their Chinese counterparts. The difference is a free media. In China, news of unpleasant incidents involving the authorities does make it to the papers, but only after the government has begun trying to set things right. Authorities cover up till the problem becomes too major to be ignored. One thing needs to be said though. The first thing the authorities do is apologize publicly (unless it?s a violent clash between the police and the people). Imagine any minister doing that in India!

 Hidden truth

 However, this time, the apology didn?t help. A Harbin resident has sued the petrochemical company responsible for the leak, a subsidiary of a state-owned petroleum giant. His main demand is a formal apology to be printed in all the major newspapers, on the orders of the court. 

 This time, the press is also toeing a harder line. The China Daily carried a full-page piece on the lack of safe drinking water for China?s rural citizens. In an uncharacteristically strong edit, it pointed out that while officials of the administration and the company apologized for the leak, ?they never apologized for the hiding of truth...The fact is they have brought shame on themselves by covering up the truth.??

 But say cynics, nothing gets published without the Party?s nod. This time, Premier Wen Jiabao himself visited the main filtration plant in Harbin and asked the troops involved in restoring water supply, to ?Make the masses? water completely safe...we must not allow the masses to be short of water.? Could Harbin?s proximity to Russia, and its upcoming International Ice and Snow Festival, a major tourist attraction, have anything to do with this high-profile concern for the masses?

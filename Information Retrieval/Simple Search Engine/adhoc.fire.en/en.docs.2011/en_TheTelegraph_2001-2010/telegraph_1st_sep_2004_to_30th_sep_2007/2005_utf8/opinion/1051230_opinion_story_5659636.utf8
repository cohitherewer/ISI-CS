 The unerring line 

 The best cartoons are ?exquisite explosive devices?, writes 

 David Remnick in his foreword to the magnificent THE COMPLETE 

 CARTOONS OF THE NEW YORKER (Black Dog, $60). It is 

 wiser not to take up the challenge of identifying among 

 the 68,647 cartoons ? ?every cartoon ever published? in 

 the 80 years of The New Yorker ? one that 

 does not cause an explosion of laughter, or of startled 

 reflection. Each artist is different, in perfection of style, 

 tone and shade of humour ? provoking, sinister, outrageously 

 funny or just absurd. The perfection is the result of hard 

 consultation among editors and artists for hours every morning, 

 for the cartoon is essential to The New Yorker. Arranged 

 by decade, they present an irresistible sociological history 

 of the country. The editor, Robert Mankoff, found that specific 

 themes emerged from each decade. The introductions to each 

 decade add to the value of this unforgettable book.

 WORKING AT IT

 The law is not always an ass. The protection against sexual harassment of women bill 2005, slated for passage in parliament in the winter session, has much that is sensible ? and much-needed. Women may feel relieved to think that every establishment with more than 50 employees would have an internal complaints committee, which they could appeal to if harassed by their male colleagues or superiors. Since harassment in the workplace is a daily ? and threatening ? reality for many, there is reason for relief. The directions that the bill contains regarding the structure of the complaints committee, its gender component, and procedures derive from the guidelines given by the Supreme Court in 1997. But for the law not to be an ass, it is necessary to look a little more closely at both the way the committees and their procedures have been conceptualized as well as the experience of the sexual harassment cells that are already functioning in many institutions, such as universities.

 The earlier guidelines and the bill are valuable because they identify a form of harmful, sometimes violent, behaviour that is targeted at the vulnerable in any workplace. In India, the number of the vulnerable is made up overwhelmingly of women. Therefore, a law against sexual harassment would benefit them most. But a law should be so framed as to benefit all victims of sexual harassment, irrespective of gender. The bill ignores the possibility that a man may be the object of sexual harassment in the workplace or that a woman could harass another woman. It is puerile to picture sexual harassment in terms of a male-female battle. While the balance of power in society certainly favours the male, the law should be impartial in its rhetoric. The woman is given to decide whether the ?sexually-determined behaviour? is ?unwelcome?. Leaving everything to the women?s ?perception? may seem emotionally fair, but that again ignores the fact that employees from widely differing social, cultural and regional backgrounds may get their signals frantically crossed. People have very different ideas about the point at which any behaviour becomes ?sexually determined?. Most important, sexual harassment has often to do with power, personal, professional or political. Policies regarding formation and functioning of the committee cannot overlook this question if sexual harassment is to be tackled at all.

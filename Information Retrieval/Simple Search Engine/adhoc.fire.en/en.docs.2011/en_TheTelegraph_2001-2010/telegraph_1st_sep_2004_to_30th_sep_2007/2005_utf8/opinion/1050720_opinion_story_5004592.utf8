 WHAT PRICE FREEDOM?

 Beena Sarwar

 ?The media in Pakistan has never been freer.? This is something one hears repeated often by government functionaries, by ordinary people, Pakistanis visiting from overseas, foreigners...And it?s great for Pakistan?s image. But is it true? 

 Wasn?t the car of an outspoken reporter burnt outside his residence in Lahore? It happened on November 22, 2003, and was accompanied by aerial firing. And hasn?t he also been barred from writing in the publication he worked for?

 The reporter is Amir Mir. And his trials are far from over.

 The Pakistani media has largely ignored his plight. Some journalists feel that he ?deserved? what he got. But can such tactics be justified? Certainly Amir has followed up on issues that are ?safer? not to touch. But if journalists only report on what the establishment wants them to, no government corruption would ever be exposed.

 I?ve known Amir since the time he started reporting for The Frontier Post in Lahore in 1989, while still a student at Government College; I was features editor. He soon established himself as an upright, hardworking, and fiery reporter; he later worked with The News, then went on to become editor of a weekly independent journal, where he continued exposing corruption and dubious alliances.

 Once, two men with revolvers got into his car and tried, unsuccessfully, to make him go with them. At one point he was forced to go abroad for his own safety ? he could have stayed there and applied for political asylum like many others, but he is not one to run away. 

 However, in June 2003, he was forced to quit under ?government pressure?. But a mainstream media house approached him in his hour of need and he joined their monthly magazine. Now, he finds himself jobless again, for the third time since 2000. He has had to resign.

 Official terror 

 He believes it were his reports and especially his book, The True Face of Jehadis, which explored the post-9/11 state of jehad, and the jehadi organizations and their links with intelligence agencies, that invited the wrath of the establishment. Amir says that in November 2004, soon after the book was published, some men came to his house, identifying themselves as belonging to an intelligence agency. They wanted to ?update? their files on him, and warned him to be more careful in what he wrote.

 Amir subsequently wrote a letter to his management appraising it of this development. This time, he found little support. He was barred from writing and his name was taken off the masthead in December 2004 although he was retained on the pay-roll ? for the moment.

 He says a senior officer of the press information department called him on June 2, 2005 saying that the European Union had taken up the issue with the Pakistan government, which wanted a written statement denying the harassment charges. ?I refused, saying that I have neither lodged any such complaint nor will I deny the harassment charges. A few days later, I was asked by the management to try my luck somewhere else. I subsequently submitted my resignation.?

 I.A. Rehman, long time journalist, former editor of the Pakistan Times and now director of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, finds parallels in Amir?s situation with that of the journalist, Zohair Siddiqui, in the Sixties, who found all avenues closed for him after the outspoken Civil and Military Gazette, where he worked, was shut down. The government ensured that no other newspaper hired him, and he found himself either unemployed or forced to take up public relations jobs.

 One would hope that today, under a government that prides itself on allowing a free media and repeatedly states its commitment to freedom of expression, Amir Mir will not be forced to take the same road.

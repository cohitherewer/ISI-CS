 Theft slur on library staff

 - Wealth stealth

 TAMAL SENGUPTA 

 A senior official of National Library was caught red-handed last month while leaving the premises with photocopies of valuable documents.

 Library sources said the authorities had tried to hush up the matter before ordering an inquiry. The official has been asked to submit a explanation to the authorities.

 Security personnel had found the documents on the assistant library and information officer (ALIO) in charge of the microphotography department, Ashok Kumar Nath, while he was leaving office around 6.45 pm on November 14.

 Library director Sudhendu Mandal reportedly wrote in a secret note: ?The ALIO was found leaving the Annexe Building with some photocopies for personal use. Guard N. Alam, who was on duty, noticed this premeditated act on part of Nath. Asit Kumar Pyne, another security personnel, was present during the incident. On being questioned, Nath was furious and abused the guards in filthy language.?

 The note continues: ?It was also reported that the above incident is not an isolated one. Nath used to take official papers out of the library quite often.? When contacted, Mandal said on Monday that he had ordered a probe into the incident and asked the ALIO to submit his reply by December 2.

 ?I will initiate action against the official once the charges against him are proved,? the director asserted.

 Nath, however, refused comment. ? Whatever I have to say, I will say to the authorities,? he said. 

 In the secret note, Mandal had further written: ?Nath acted on the basis of a plan of action. His misdeed amounts to misconduct unbecoming of a government officer. His action casts doubt on his integrity. He has contravened sub rules (i) and (iii) of the Central Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1964.

 ?Nath is therefore called upon to explain in writing as to why appropriate disciplinary action should not be taken against him.? 

 Security at National Library was stepped up a couple of years ago, following transfer of 30,000 books, journals and manuscripts to the newly-built Bhasha Bhavan from the old building.

 The authorities have engaged a private agency to guard valuable documents at the library and monitor the shift of books. The agency works in conjunction with the library?s own guards.

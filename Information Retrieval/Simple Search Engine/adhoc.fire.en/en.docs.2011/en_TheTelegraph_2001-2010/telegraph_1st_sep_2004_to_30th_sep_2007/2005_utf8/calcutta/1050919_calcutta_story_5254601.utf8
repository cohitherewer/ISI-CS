The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Water pipe repair by Puja

 SOVAN CHATTERJEE, Trinamul Congress councillor of ward 132 and chairman of Borough XIV of Calcutta Municipal Corporation, met readers of The Telegraph at his office to answer their queries. Participants included Shyamadas Roy (councillor of ward 126), Subrata Chakrabarty, Tarun Basu, Sreela Banerjee (councillor of ward 130), Biswajit Mahattam, Rama Dasgupta, Deepak Mukherjee, Pulak Pal, Anjan Das (councillor of ward 129) and Sova Ghosh (councillor of ward 131).

Subrata Chakrabarty: Residents of Parnasree, especially those who live near the post office, face a lot of problems due to leakage of water from pipes. The area often gets waterlogged, making it impossible for residents to venture out. Are you planning to remedy the situation? 

 I am aware of the leakage problem. It gets aggravated when the pressure of water supplied from Garden Reach is increased. I will make an all-out effort to plug the leakage before the Puja. Major work is already scheduled to be undertaken on the pipeline after the Puja, so the snag should be repaired permanently.

Shyamadas Roy: The Asian Development Bank (ADB) allotted funds for all wards of boroughs XIII and XIV. But nine wards of the boroughs have been made ?non-priority?, even though Charial canal passes through them. Draining of the canal is urgently needed. Are you planning to do that?

 A team of Trinamul councillors met mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya on September 10 to discuss the matter. We made it clear that though we have no problems with the work undertaken with ADB money, we will not allow the nine wards to be neglected. We want to ensure that places like Anandanagar, Sabujdwip and Sonamukhi do not get waterlogged during monsoon. The residents of the areas have been facing the problem for a long time. We want an immediate end to the waterlogging. 

Shyamadas Roy: Could you please explain how the wards are made ?priority? and ?non-priority??

 The ADB authorities did not want the wards to be given such tags. It was a section of officers who misled the councillors. The system should immediately be stopped, otherwise people will continue to suffer. Problems should be solved, irrespective of the wards where they occur. 

Tarun Basu: Garbage is not regularly collected in ward 131, in Parnasree. Are you planning to regularise garbage collection?

 I will discuss the issue with the councillor of the ward. I have heard that the residents have engaged a private agency to do the work. This cannot go on as garbage collection is the duty of the civic conservancy department. I shall see to it that the garbage is regularly cleared. Otherwise there may be an outbreak of diseases.

Subrata Chakrabarty: Open drains pose health hazards in Parnasree. They have become breeding grounds for mosquitoes, resulting in incidence of various diseases, including dengue and malaria. Can Calcutta Municipal Corporation use the ADB funds to improve the drainage system? 

 There are plans to cover up open drains in various parts of the city, including Parnasree. Underground drains will be constructed for the sake of public health. The civic body is especially concerned as dengue has claimed a large number of lives in Calcutta. 

Tarun Basu: Steel pipes do not supply drinking water to all parts of Parnasree. In some places, the water is supplied through asbestos pipes, which often crack, leading to contamination. Consequently, water-borne diseases such as diarrhoea, jaundice and cholera are common in Parnasree. How do you plan to tackle the problem? 

 You have raised a vital issue. To be totally honest, we do not have a map of water pipes in Parnasree and hence, cannot say which area has what kind of water pipe.

 However, we plan to lay steel or PVC water pipes in all areas, as these last long. For the time being, we will see to it that the existing leaks are repaired and the drinking water is not contaminated.

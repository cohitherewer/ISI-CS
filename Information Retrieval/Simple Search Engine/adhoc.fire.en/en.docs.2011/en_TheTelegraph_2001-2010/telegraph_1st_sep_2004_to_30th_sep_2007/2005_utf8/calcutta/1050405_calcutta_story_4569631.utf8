The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

?I?m becoming a psychopath after all this?

From the passionate priest in Sins to the cool cop in 

Karam to the political player in Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi, model-turned-actor 

Shiney Ahuja is shining bright. He speaks to Pratim D. Gupta about his 

plans to increase his market value in Bollywood

Your scenes in Karam were never shot fearing 

that you would steal the thunder from the main cast?

Yes, a lot of my part was cut out from Karam. 

Not at the editing table. They were never shot even though they were there in 

the script. That?s how the industry works I believe. Anybody who watches the film 

would know how my role was shortened intentionally. However, people have liked 

my performance. They didn?t like the film but they called up to tell me that my 

six scenes were the only watchable portions in Karam. In hindsight, I don?t 

regret doing the film because many important people in the industry have realised 

my potential. 

You have got good press for Sins, too, although 

it ran into a lot of controversy?

When I agreed to do Sins, I had an idea that 

since the topic we are touching is so sensitive, there would be problems but I 

could have never imagined that the controversy would be this big. But my character 

was so great that anyone would have jumped to do it. I had to play someone double 

my age ? a 45-50-year-old who falls for a 19-year-old girl. That was so challenging. 

The progression of the character was beautiful too with the Father being reduced 

to something which he was not. Although Sins was a big hit, I wouldn?t 

like to talk about it now.

You would have liked Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi 

to be your debut. Isn?t that the first film you signed?

Yes, but not before I was sidelined from Dil Chahta 

Hai. After my suiting and shirting ads, I was auditioned and picked to play 

the role of Sid alongside Aamir Khan and Saif Ali Khan. But then they decided 

to go for a star and Akshaye Khanna was brought in my place. The good thing that 

happened was Farhan (Akhtar) recommended me to Sudhir Mishra for Hazaaron Khwaishen 

Aisi.

All those who have seen Hazaaron? are gung-ho 

about your performance in the film?

I have received a lot of appreciation from the likes 

of Shekhar Kapur and Ashutosh Gowariker, who have seen the preview. Hazaaron? 

won?t be a Kaho Naa? Pyar Hai for me but people would take notice of 

me as an actor. The film should have released after Kaante, but once it 

was invited to the Berlin Film Festival, the producers thought that it should 

travel to all the international festivals before being commercially released in 

the country.

Why do you think Hazaaron? is such a landmark 

film for Indian cinema?

You have to watch it to find out. It?s an epic saga 

of love with the political backdrop of India in the early 70s. I can?t even put 

it in a single genre. It?s a love story, a political drama, a period piece, an 

epic and even a thriller in the last 20 minutes. It?s a very moving film.

What?s your character in the film?

I play this political fixer who comes from the small 

town of Meerut, gets into a really good college in a big city and falls in love 

with this girl. This is where my life starts in the film in 1969 and it goes on 

till 1977. The story keeps moving through these eight years on screen with the 

focus on the woman who is torn between these two men, clearly knowing that she 

doesn?t love any of them. Then there?s also a sexual chemistry between them. There?s 

so much happening in the film?

Which other films are you doing?

I just shot for Agar in Sri Lanka. It is being 

directed by Amit Saxena, the maker of Jism, and I star opposite Vidya Malvade, 

who acted in Inteha. In Agar, I have an unshaded white character. 

After playing all these four differently shaded characters, I think I am becoming 

a psychopath at the end of it all.

Is that because you get too much into the character 

you are playing?

Perhaps. I believe there?s only one right approach 

to a particular scene. When I play a character who is like me I go on an emotional 

memory trip to recall how I should act out a particular scene but when the character?s 

not like me, I use some method to get into the skin of it.

You have been turning down a lot of offers from 

big film-makers?

Yes, I have turned down three very big directors and 

producers because the roles haven?t been that good. They are planning these Rs 

40-50 crore projects with the Khans. I don?t fit into their scheme of things as 

a leading man. But they want to work with me all right. After seeing Hazaaron?, 

they only asked me not to do small roles but to go out there and increase my market 

value. I have also decided not to do ads any more unless they pay me like stars. 

I know the commercials made me but it?s time to move on. 

And will you keep calling yourself Shiney?

That?s my real name. And honestly, I like my name. 

If I had a problem I would have thought about changing it. But there are people 

who love me and love calling me by that name and cannot imagine me as anything 

else but Shiney. Career is important but not that important so as to hurt their 

feelings.

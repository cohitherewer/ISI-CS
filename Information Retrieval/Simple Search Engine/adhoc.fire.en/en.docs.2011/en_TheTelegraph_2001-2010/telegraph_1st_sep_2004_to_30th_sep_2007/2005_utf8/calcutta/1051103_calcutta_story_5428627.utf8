 The festive season is almost drawing to a close and you can feel the change in the air. This season, keep a close watch on the colours that rule your wardrobe ? for that could decide whether you look hot in the weeks of chill.

 Keeping international forecasts in mind, the trend for this years winter is tilted towards richer and stronger versions of the earthy and muted shades ruling the racks for most of the year.

 And for most Indian designers, a combination of shades in rich oranges, rich coffee, greys and steels provides the palette to pick from.

 There is also no forgetting the classic black that is all set to make a very big comeback.

 Colour plus

 Says Mumbai-based designer Monisha Jaisingh: The colours that are going to be really hot this winter are starkly different from the ones that ruled last year, purple and green. This year is undoubtedly for rich earthy shades like rich coffee, instead of the light brown, in terms of both Indian as well as western wear.

 According to Monisha, the one thing about these colours that makes them really hot is the fact that when mixed and matched, they look stunning. These colours also go very well with black, which is going to be very big this season.

 Calcutta designer Shantanu Goenka detects a strong tilt towards steels and earthy browns.

 so, orange which is being dubbed as the new black is here to stay in shades both light and dark, feels Shantanu.

 These colours are powered by the fact that they look equally nice on all kinds of garments, whether bridals, Indian or western wear. Turquoise in various shades that looks great on washed-out fabrics, should also do well. My collection will have a lot of these colours and more.

 Range riot

 There are some who refuse to be restricted when it comes to colours. Designer Sayon Mitra is working with black, grey, mustard, red, gold, bronze, shades of green, violet as well as maroon.

 I am using so many colours because I mostly make western clothes and like them to be very vibrant. But at the same time, I have also been using a lot of those rich muted shades that are so very much in vogue. These colours best reflect the mood of a year that has witnessed many untoward incidents, feels Sayon.

 Another young designer, Preeti Jhawar, is working with a lot of chocolate brown, steel grey, scarlet red, moss green and indigo blue.

 Darker colours are very much in because volume in terms of silhouettes is big this season. These colours also go very well with fabrics like velvet and satin. Besides, they also complement black, which is making the biggest comeback this season, says Preeti.

 Black beauty

 ack, clearly, is back where it belongs this winter ? on the cool and the classy.

 And black is not boring. Ask young designer Meenakshi Dadoo, busy doing off-beat things with black. No colour goes as well as black for the winters; it is truly classic. But I prefer to use it in a slightly different way, by not limiting black to that one sexy party dress. I mix it up with different kinds of rich earthy shades, natural shades and jewel stone colours, my other picks for the season for that sensuous look, says Meenakshi.

 The final word (and not from a certain Mr Bhansali): Mix and matchall the colours you want this season, but dont dare forget that black is back.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Held for laced medicine

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A city-based homoeopathy doctor has been arrested on charges of lacing the medicine he dispensed to his patients with steroids.

 Sunny Bakshi was brought to the city on Saturday from Delhi, where he has been hiding since April, after a complaint was lodged at the Shakespeare Sarani police station.

 He has been produced in court and remanded in judicial custody.

 Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (south division), said Bakshi was arrested on the basis of a complaint lodged by the drug control directorate.

 ?We sealed his chambers in April after receiving the complaint from drug control directorate,? said Sharma. Bakshi had five chambers in north and south Calcutta.

 In April, drug control department officials learnt that Bakshi had been mixing steroids with his medicine.

 ?We lodged a complaint with Shakespeare Sarani police station and raided one of his chambers in the area. We collected samples of the medicines from there,? explained a drug control official.

 Laboratory tests confirmed the presence of steroids in the drugs, and another complaint was lodged. According to regulations, mixing steroids with homoeopathic medicine is a serious offence.

 After the arrest warrant was issued, the search began. ?We searched all the places where Bakshi could have been hiding,? said an officer. But he was nowhere to be found.

 Finally, last week, police received a tip-off that Bakshi was in Delhi, and a team was sent to arrest him. He was tracked down on Thursday.

 Sharma also said Bakshi is being interrogated for any information he might have about other doctors lacing medicine in a similar manner.

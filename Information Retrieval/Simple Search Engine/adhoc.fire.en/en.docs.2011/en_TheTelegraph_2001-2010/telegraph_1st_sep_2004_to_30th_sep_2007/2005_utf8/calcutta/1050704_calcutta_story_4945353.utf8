The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Flight data a dial away

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Dial one number for all inquiries, bookings, tele-check-in, flight information et al. 

 That?s what Indian Airlines is aiming for. With the launch of the 1407 service in April, the system is already in place.

 The national carrier has been expanding of late. Although it will be a while before the new aircraft arrive, and with it the promise of increased flights, including those to and from Calcutta, the 24x7 helpline has been filling a gap.

 ?We?ve been working on the project for the past year. The soft launch was in April, with inquiries first and then bookings. On June 28, we started tele-check-in. In time, we hope to add more services and make it toll-free,? explained Meenackshi Mallik, chief manager (commercial), eastern region.

 The service is available in Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta, Chennai, Hyderabad and Bangalore at local rates. But customers in other cities can also dial in, at STD rates. 

 A call centre in Delhi deals with in-coming calls. ?Each of the six cities have call centres that deal with outbound calls, in terms of Indian Airlines informing customers about sales promotions, flight delays, etc,? adds Mallik. 

 The service includes SMS and voice response facilities. The language options include English, Hindi and two regional languages, which in Calcutta are Bengali and Assamese. 

 ?From Calcutta, we receive around 800 to 1,000 calls per day. In Delhi, it?s about 2,500,? says Mallik.

 The service is outsourced, but with representatives from Indian Airlines in every centre. It?s a ?constant system?, with an ongoing process of recruiting and training of personnel, as well as upgrading and adding of services.

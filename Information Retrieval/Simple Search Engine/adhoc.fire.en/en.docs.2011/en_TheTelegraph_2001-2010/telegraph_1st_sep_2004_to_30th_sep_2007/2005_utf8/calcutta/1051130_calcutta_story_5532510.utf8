The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Five-year biotech courses

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Calcutta University (CU) has started talks with the University Grants Commission (UGC) to introduce a five-year integrated course in bio-technology at its affiliated undergraduate colleges.

 The university authorities announced on Monday that they would not allow a single college affiliated to it to open three-year B.Sc courses in biotech ? already in operation in other states ? however much they may be in demand among students.

 Courses in biotech have emerged as one of the most sought-after areas of study among meritorious students because they expose them to a wide range of openings in the job market here and abroad.

 Since there is no scope for studying the subject in Calcutta, over the past few years, many high-performing students from the city have moved to other metros, where many universities started offering the three-year B.Sc biotech courses at least four years ago.

 ?If our students leave Calcutta to study biotech in three years in other metros, we will not stop them. After consulting various agencies and experts in biotech, we have come to the conclusion that we should not allow three-year B.Sc biotech courses,? D.J. Chattopadhyay, Calcutta University dean of science, confirmed. He is also overseeing the framing of the government?s biotech policies.

 The CU initiative is in response to government thinking that three-year B.Sc biotech courses are not ?desirable?, as such a short period is insufficient for a student to acquire the desired level of knowledge in physics, chemistry, mathematics and biology.

 As of now, the UGC has positively responded to the university?s proposal and if things move in the right direction, the authorities will be able to grant permission to allow at least one college in the city to run the five-year integrated course within the next year.

 St Xavier?s College has already given a proposal to the university seeking permission to run the proposed five-year course. 

 ?We have examined the proposal well and the course should start operating from the next academic session,? said Suranjan Das, CU pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs). He is also a member of the UGC.

 Other CU affiliates having adequate infrastructure, like Presidency College, may also be allowed to run such courses.

 Chattopadhyay said experts in the department of biotechnology of the central government and the Indian Institute of Chemical Biology in Calcutta, who were consulted, had recommended a longer period of study beyond the three-year structure.

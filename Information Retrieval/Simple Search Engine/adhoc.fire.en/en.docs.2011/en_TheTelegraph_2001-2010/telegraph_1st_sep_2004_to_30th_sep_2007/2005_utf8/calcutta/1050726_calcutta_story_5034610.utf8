The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cops axed, cops added 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A sub-inspector of Bidhannagar (South) police station, Arun Dutta, on patrol duty on Sunday night, has been suspended and thana inspector-in-charge S. Chakraborty showcaused.

 ?We have taken action against these officials for neglect of duty,? Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas, said on Monday.

 The police action of arrest and admonishment would do little to pacify a township brutally exposed to the terror tactics of gangs on the prowl in dark and deserted pockets.

 The day after a gang of four spent six hours raiding houses and then raping a young girl, a high-level security meeting was convened to improve the security cordon.

 It was decided that additional police personnel would be deployed and a larger number of vehicles given to the three Bidhannagar police stations.

 ?For now, it has been decided that an additional 100 police personnel will be deployed in Salt Lake and 10 vehicles, including four-wheelers and motorcycles, provided,? said a source at Writers? Buildings.

 At Monday?s meeting, police officers of Salt Lake sought more man and machine power to tighten security in the township. ?Their request has been granted and an official order will be issued soon. They have got a verbal assurance,? the sources added.

 Policing in Salt Lake will also undergo a strategic shift in the coming days. 

 ?The methodology will be changed and policing will be made more effective,? said an official. 

 Predictably, it turned out to be a heavy-policing day at Salt Lake with increased vigil inside the township and at all entry-exit points.

 The Salt Lake resident was not impressed. 

 ?Every time such an incident occurs, police tighten security and also harass innocent residents. A few days later, they become as careless as ever,? alleged Geeta Biswas, CPM councillor from ward 16 of Bidhannagar Municipality, under which falls the latest target of terror, GC block.

 ?Even the night patrol is not carried out properly. Patrol vans take one round inside a block and then go away, not to return again during that night. All that the gangs need to do is target a block, wait for the patrol to pass and then do what they want,? said a senior citizen, living in fear in GC block.

 Math minus phobia is new aim of teachers 

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Mathematics teachers of prominent English-medium schools in the city have joined hands to devise ways to dispel the fear of the subject among students. 

 The teachers attribute the phobia to prevalent teaching techniques, which do not stress on explaining the concepts well. Instead, the students are only taught a few methods to solve a fixed set of problems. 

 The emphasis, clearly, is on preparing the students to score a certain percentage of marks in exams, instead of encouraging them to understand the subject.

 To address the problem, the teachers have decided to teach the subject by relating it to real-life instances.

 Citing an example, Amal Bhowmick, a teacher at South Point, said students often see labourers engaged in erecting iron pillars at construction sites or boring tubewells. 

 ?The labourers, while pulling heavy objects, are heard chanting some lines. There is a mathematical explanation on how the rhythm helps workers gain force. Students will find sums interesting if we can include this kind of instances in classroom lectures,? Bhowmick explained. 

 The teachers will submit a set of proposals to the government and the secondary education board on reforming the curriculum and the teaching technique.

 The suggestions will include introduction of a course on the history of mathematics. Besides, the teachers want the board to stop the practice of awarding grace marks whenever examinees complain of a difficult paper.

 ?The syllabus has undergone several changes, but the phobia among students is increasing by the year,? said Bibhas Guha, a teacher at Nava Nalanda School.

 He pointed out that a change in the syllabus is not enough for tackling the problem. ?We need to change our teaching pattern. And we need to do it now. There is no point waiting for the government to take a decision. We can start the process on our own,? he asserted

 Arundhati Mukherjee, a teacher at Gokhale Memorial School, said the rate of failure in Madhyamik is highest in English, followed by maths. 

 ?Science and technology are advancing at a tremendous pace. We will have to suffer if we fail to impart quality education in mathematics to all categories of students,? she warned.

 The day-long conference, scheduled for July 14, will have four sessions. Session I will see Underhill address retailers on issues such as understanding customer needs, change in consumption pattern, customer experience and creation of a comfortable shopping experience.

 In Session II, he will speak on mall and infrastructure, highlighting leadership issues, retail culture, key populations, in-store communication and 21st Century retail tools.

 The third session will see the release of East India Retail Report 2010 amp; Beyond, compiled by CII and Images, followed by an address by state urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya.

 The final session will feature a Q amp;A with Underhill. Participants will include industry leaders such as Vikram Bakshi from McDonald?s India, Kishore Biyani from Pantaloon, B.S. Nagesh from Shoppers? Stop and Darshan Mehta from Arvind Brands.

 ?We are proud to bring Paco Underhill to Calcutta. He is the author of Why We Buy and Call of the Mall, considered to be bibles by retailers,? said Rahul Saraf, convener of the conference and managing director of Forum.

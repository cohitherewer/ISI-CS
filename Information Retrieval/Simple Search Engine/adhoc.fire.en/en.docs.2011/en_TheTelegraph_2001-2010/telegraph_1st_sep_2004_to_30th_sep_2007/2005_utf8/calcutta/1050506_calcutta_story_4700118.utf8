 Four pillars of courage

 Circumstances bring to the fore those aspects of our character that we do not know we possess. It is then that we realize the powers hidden within us, and rise above our mundane existence to achieve deeds worthy of a true hero. Based on a Marathi play by Prashant Dalvi, Gandhars production, Char Duar, tells the story of four women who discover themselves through the trials and tribulations that life suddenly confronts them with. The play introduces us to a family comprising a mother (played by Bijoylakshmi Barman) and her three daughters. Their joys and sorrows, desires and disappointments are all too familiar to us. Yet, when the illusory equilibrium and calmness of their known world is suddenly thrown off balance, the foursome stand courageously in the face of adversity, fighting against insurmountable odds. In the process, their individual battles become part of the universal strife to establish one?s own identity, while their collective efforts assume a profound social significance. Direction: Meghnad Bhattacharya.

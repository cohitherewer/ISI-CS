 In a rare move to protect its academic ambience, Jadavpur University on Thursday finalised its decision to take over National Instruments Limited (NIL), a sick unit situated opposite the institution.

 The move for the takeover, which began last year, ended on Thursday with vice-chancellor Ashoke Nath Basu making a formal announcement at a function held on the campus in the morning, in the presence of higher education minister Satyasadhan Chakraborty. 

 ?We have got the final seal of approval from the government. All the formalities for the takeover with the departments concerned are complete,? Basu said.

 The issue was placed for discussion in a meeting of the university?s executive council, its highest policy-making body, on Wednesday. Members unanimously decided to go ahead. 

 One of the main intentions of the take-over plan is protection of the area?s academic ambience, explained Rajat Bandyopadhyay, university registrar. Raja Subodh Mullick Road, where the sprawling Jadavpur University campus is situated, is an academic hub, having at least half a dozen reputed institutions and research centres around it.

 The sick public-sector, optical instrument-manufacturing unit was under threat, as promoters had their eye on the sprawling grounds to set up commercial and residential estates. ?So, we decided to send a proposal to the government to take over the unit,? the registrar said.

 Apart from Jadavpur University, the other institutions located along the Raja Subodh Mullick Road stretch are the Indian Association for Cultivation of Science, Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Institute of Ceramic Technology, Institute of Printing Technology, Jadavpur Vidyapith and a cluster of hostels for university students. 

 The take-over will strengthen the institution?s university-industry partnership programmes and also provide it with an opportunity to expand its activities, following the Centre?s offer to upgrade it to an IIT. The take-over includes acquisition of the factory premises, the buildings and nearly 60 staff members of the unit.

 According to officers, the university has plans to set up laboratories to carry out advanced research on industrial development in the huge space available on the NIL premises, officers said.

 The state government has agreed to pay a portion of the funds required to free the mortgaged assets of NIL from a bank, officers added.

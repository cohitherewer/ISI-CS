The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Post-heist, train escorts

 - Deployment revived; railways mull passenger safety drive

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Lack of police escort ? the result of a deployment policy now being regarded as short-sighted ? was one reason why robbers could loot passengers on the Sri Jagannath Express and flee unchecked on Thursday night.

 ?Escorts are provided on trains that leave Howrah after 8 pm,? said Jit Ram Bhagat, additional director-general of police (railways). The Puri-bound train leaves Howrah at 6.35 pm and its escorts arrive only after it reaches Kharagpur, well after 8 pm.

 On Thursday night, a little before 8 pm, an armed gang boarded the S7 coach of the Sri Jagannath Express at Mecheda station, about 65 km from Calcutta. They went on a looting spree after the train crossed Panskura, and on reaching Balichak, they pulled the emergency chain and fled with a booty worth Rs 2.3 lakh.

 Bhagat suspects the robbery was carried out by a local gang. The railway police have sought the Criminal Investigation Department?s help to track down the members.

 In a case of shutting the stable doors after the horses have bolted, the railway police have decided to recast deployment. From now on, almost every long-distance train leaving Howrah and Sealdah after sunset will be provided with a Train Escort, comprising an officer and a team of around eight constables.

 In case of an unscheduled stop, the team will intervene to find out the cause. During an emergency, it will coordinate with the local unit of the Government Railway Police and the Railway Protection Force. 

 The authorities have also decided to strengthen vigil to prevent cases of passengers being drugged on train by swindlers. Since most of such incidents occur at places bordering Orissa and Bihar, the chief security commissioners of both Eastern and South Eastern Railways have called upon their counterparts in these two states to exchange information on the criminals.

 ?At a recent meeting with our counterparts, we had thrashed out issues concerning passenger security,? said Lalit Kumar, chief security commissioner of South Eastern Railway.

 Besides working on deployment of RPF personnel, the railway police have also decided to launch an ?awareness drive?, with a list of dos and don?ts, for long-distance passengers.

 ?We are in the process of putting together a campaign that aims at helping passengers realise how they can be more careful and avoid getting drugged and duped by rogues in disguise,? said S.Z. Samuel, chief security commissioner of Eastern Railway.

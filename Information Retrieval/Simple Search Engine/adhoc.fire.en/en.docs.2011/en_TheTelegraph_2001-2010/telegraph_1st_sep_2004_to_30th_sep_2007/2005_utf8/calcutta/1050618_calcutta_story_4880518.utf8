 Choreography on canvas

 Performing arts acquires a new dimension with Shadow of a Woman ? The Draupadi Phenomenon, a unique combination of dance and art in a performance that evokes pure aesthetic pleasure for the audience. This innovative duet of Odissi (by Sanchita Bhattacharya) with painting (by Piu Sarkar) narrates the story of Draupadi, one of the most tragic and representative figures of wronged womanhood. Designed in the form of an interactive, question and answer (sawaal-jawaab) session in which the two artistes communicate through painting and dance, the dance recital commences at a slow pace, like an alaap, gradually building up momentum to generate a much faster pace (drut). As the danseuse performs, moving gracefully over the dance floor, her silhouette is captured on canvas in shades of black, white and red, depicting Draupadi?s repeated dishonour, violation of her rights and her bitterness in accepting her fate. The performance reaches its climax with the earnest hope that modern women will be free from the effects of ?The Draupadi Phenomenon?.

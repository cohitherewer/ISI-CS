 Pump house victim identified 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The woman in her 30s, found murdered inside the pump house of a government housing estate in south Calcutta early on Wednesday, has been identified as Ruby Das of Sagar Island, in South 24-Parganas.

 ?We managed to get in touch with the victim?s relatives on Wednesday. They arrived on Thursday and established the identity of the body. As we had suspected, the tattooed name on her arm was not her real name,? said Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (south division), on Thursday.

 Around 7 am on Wednesday, pump operator Suresh Sardar discovered the body. 

 It was lying on its back, with a trickle of blood from the mouth. There was a mark of an injury inflicted by a blunt weapon on the back of the head.

 ?It has been confirmed that the victim was murdered inside the pump house, though the motive is still to be figured out,? Sharma added.

 Investigation has revealed that Ruby was a sex worker and used to frequent Anil Roy Road, in the Lake police station area.

 Residents of the area, including teastall-owners, provided police with the name.

 ?We had contacted local clubs and shanty-dwellers to establish the woman?s identity. A local NGO confirmed that the body was that of Ruby Das,? Sharma said.

 The killer had easy access to the government housing estate, police said.

 ?He knew fully well that the pump house remained unlocked at night. We are working on three specific leads,? Sharma added.

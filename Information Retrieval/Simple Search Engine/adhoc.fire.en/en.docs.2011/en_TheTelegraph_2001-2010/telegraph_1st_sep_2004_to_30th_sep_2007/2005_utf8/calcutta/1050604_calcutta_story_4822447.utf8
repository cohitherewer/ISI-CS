 Suicide averted

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Four cops saved 21-year-old Bipul Bhattacharya (name changed), who jumped into Rabindra Sarobar late on Thursday to end his life. 

 The youth, a resident of Howrah, is a B.Com (Part I) student and was depressed for not doing well in the second paper on Thursday. 

 ?After the test, he came straight to the Lakes and started roaming aimlessly,? said Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (south). He spent nearly eight hours at the Lakes. ?I was in a fix. I could not decide whether I should kill myself,? he later told the cops. 

 After sunset, Bipul sat under a tree to avoid police vigil. ?Around 10 pm, he approached the banks of the waterbody, took off his shoes and clothes and jumped in,? said Sharma.

 The splash drew the attention of the four policemen on duty ? Abdul Gaffar Khan, Sujoy Chaki, Srikanta Kundu and Pradip Pyne. 

 They scanned the water surface and spotted Bipul struggling to save himself. 

 Without wasting a moment, the four jumped into the water and dragged Bipul to the banks. ?Fortunately, the men spotted him immediately after he jumped. Had they been late, the boy would have drowned,? said Sharma.

 Bipul was brought to Lake police station, and kept there till his father Bibhuti Bhattacharya arrived.

 The deputy commissioner said: ?The four policemen have done an excellent job. I will recommend their names for departmental awards.?

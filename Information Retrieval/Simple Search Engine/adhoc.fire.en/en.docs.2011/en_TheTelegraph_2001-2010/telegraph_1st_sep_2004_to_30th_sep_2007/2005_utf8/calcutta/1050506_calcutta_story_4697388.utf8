Bada Badshah, Bombshell Bianca, Balwantbhai Balloonwala or Bernardo Biscotti? You can choose your table by your favourite Dali-esque poster and enjoy the witty and distinctive limericks as you dig into your Thai Chilli Chicken or a platter of north Indian kebabs.

 At BBs, housed on the ground level of Sector Vs IBM Building in Salt Lake, the ?possibilities are endless? and the diners have the ?freedom to add their own twist to the food?, points out its young entrepreneur Anand Puri, son of Sunny and Sashi Puri of Trincas fame.

 The citys latest new-age restaurant serving Oriental, Mediterranean and Indian fare fired the burners of its live kitchen a week ago, carrying forward the Trincas lore and legacy. The Park Street eatery was started by Anands grandfather .P. Puri and Ellis Joshua way back in 1959.

 ?Yes, Im aware of the lineage and mom and dad have been great inspirations. Just like Trincas is a landmark in downtown Calcutta, I want to make BBs a destination in Sector V, not just a casual drive-by stop,? stresses the 24-year-old third-generation Puri.

 Anand, who has done his hospitality management at Cornell University in New York, managed the vibrant Sushi Samba, a Japanese-Brazilian fusion restaurant in New York, and helped start an Indian restaurant in Boston, before returning to his roots to do his ?own thing?.

 The 3,000-sq ft minimalist place seating 110 has Salvador Dali strewn all over on the framed posters, each of which carries a B-B caption, like Bobby Blue. ?Dali fascinates me and I am grateful to Fahd Hussain for creating these wonderfully original artwork images, culling stylised elements from the work of my favourite painter,? says Anand.

 The highly contemporary look of BBs has also been inspired by Ian Schraeger, who used to run the now-shut iconic nightclub, Studio 54, in New York of the 70s, and has bounced back with a chain of stylish boutique hotels.

 The parents are upbeat, too. ?It gives us a lot of pride seeing the next generation set up something new and characteristic. He has done his own homework and we just stood by,? says Sashi.

 ?Trincas has had a changing profile over the years, but always a faithful clientele. BBs would have a different target audience, and we are happy to reach out to Salt Lake and the emerging Rajarhat township,? says Sunny.

 With pastas and pizzas, kebabs and dosas, BBs hopes to provide ?enough options? and freedom of choice while covering the basics. You can add the jalapenos and the Neapolitan sauce to your pastas and control your own cuisine at the see-through, interactive kitchen.

 ?This area will soon become the new Park Street of Calcutta. We hope to catch the crest with our international ambience, eclectic mix and pocket-friendly prices,? declares Anand.

 On the lines of Trincas, BBs hopes to add live music to its platter soon. ?Weekends could be reserved for established bands, but during weekdays, we would love to provide a launch pad for young, talented outfits,? says Puri junior, who plans to do some bartending himself once the liquor license is in.

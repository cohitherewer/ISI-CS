 Family falls in lift after dinner out 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A dinner out ended with a fright for a family on Monday night, when a lift at the 22 Camac Street mall collapsed.

 Alka Saraogi and her family, including two children, left the fifth-floor restaurant Grain of Salt at 10.45 pm, when the elevator they stepped into malfunctioned, its doors refusing to open, leaving the family trapped for around 15 minutes.

 ?On the way down, the lift was wobbling and, without stopping on any of the floors, it went down to hit the pit with a thud,? said Saraogi, the 2001 Sahitya Academy award winner. ?We called the restaurant but they were slow to respond. We managed to force open the door, but the outer door would not budge,? she said.

 After security personnel and restaurant staff came to the rescue, Saraogi lodged a complaint with Shakespeare Sarani police station, charging negligence. 

 ?On the basis of the complaint, we have begun a probe,? said Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (south).

 Aloke More and others trapped inside claimed security staff arrived on hearing their cries for help. 

 The lift was lodged in a pit below the ground-floor level, causing difficulty in releasing the doors. Finally, a stick was used to prise them open and get the passengers out.

 On Tuesday, Otis Care issued a certificate stating the lift had been overloaded.

 CB Richard Ellis South Asia Private Limited is the company in charge of maintenance of the lift. ?We carry out regular maintenance of all three lifts in the block. The report available with us suggests lift number two was overloaded last night. Now, things have been taken care of and all lifts are operational,? said Niraj Kumar, a senior executive of the company.

 The restaurant authorities issued a statement saying the elevator overload alarm had gone off but the passengers did not pay heed. 

 The lift is also not exclusively meant for the restaurant, and is a part of the mall. ?If the lift failed, we can?t be blamed. Besides, our staff had rushed to the rescue,? said Pankaj Tandon, administrative head.

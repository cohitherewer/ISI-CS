 A gang of 20 barged into a Swiss Park house on Wednesday evening; bashed up 80-year-old Bijoy Chatterjee and his son Avijit; and made away with Rs 6,000, a Hamilton watch and a Mont Blanc pen.

 ?Are you thinking of going to police? I will bury your father alive and rape your wife if you do,? was the parting shot of gang leader Janak Roy, who runs Vidyarthi Motor Training School in the neighbourhood, to the 34-year-old son.

 The Chatterjees? fault: they had objected to the parking of eight cars of the school in the common passage in front of their house.

 Since the incident, Avijit?s wife has been staying at her parents? home. His father, with stitches on the head, is being treated at a nursing home.

 An FIR has been lodged with Charu Market thana. Deputy commissioner (south) N.R. Babu said: ?Two people have been arrested. We are carrying out raids in search of the other culprits. The main accused has got himself admitted to a hospital, but we will nab all of them shortly.?

 Janak told Metro that the charges against him were false. ?The Chatterjees had assaulted me. I will lodge a case against them, but I will seek an anticipatory bail first.?

 Trouble started around 7 pm on Wednesday, when Avijit asked Janak to park his cars in a way that they did not block the common road.

 ?He was enraged. Swearing at me, he tried to run me over. My father was alarmed and ran after his car, asking him to go away,? recalled Avijit, nursing a broken rib and several bruises on his head, neck and chest. Roy went away, threatening Avijit: ?Tumhara lash gira dega (I?ll kill you)?.

 He returned in 10 minutes, with his sons, drivers from his school and other aides.

 ?Around 20 people arrived on motorcycles and caught hold of Avijit. They rained blows on him and even beat him up with a wooden plank. To escape the mob, he hid behind a bamboo cluster nearby,? recounted a young girl, who witnessed the incident.

 Not satisfied, the group then grabbed the 80-year-old by his hair and dragged him inside his house. Locking out his son, they beat him up in the bedroom. The mob left around 8 pm, after pocketing the valuables and money on the table, leaving the old man bleeding on the floor.

 Car parking is a common problem in the neighbourhood, residents said. The space on the ground floor of an apartment block, where Janak parks his cars, is not enough for all his vehicles.

 ?Six-seven cars always spill out and block the common passage. Whenever we complain to his drivers, Janak abuses us,? said a neighbour of the Chatterjees.

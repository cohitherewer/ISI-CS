The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Intrigue, the power of 10

 ANUBHAV SINHA may have signed on the four hottest hunks of Bollywood, but he refuses to label Dus an action film. He tells Pratim D. Gupta just why twists and turns, rather than blood and gore, will define his debut in this genre

 Sanjay Dutt, Suniel Shetty, Abhishek Bachchan and Zayed Khan head the star-studded cast of Dus

 John Woo meets Wachowski brothers and you get Dus! Although a Bollywood film, Anubhav Sinha?s Dus is anything but a desi potboiler. With cool shades and hot babes, speedy bikes and slow-mo action, the Nitin Manmohan production is a visual feast shot in the exotic locales of Canada. To release next Friday at a theatre near you, this is strictly unchartered territory from the maker of mushy rom-coms Tum Bin and Aapko Pehle Bhi Kahin Dekha Hai.

 ?Dus was never a conscious effort to come out of the romantic comedy genre,? says Anubhav. ?It was more about the script. It was always a good script with great action. In fact, Dus was being written for four newcomers. Halfway through the scripting we realised that the film required stars. It had become very big for newcomers and star charisma was an absolute must.?

 But just a star in the cast is one thing and having everybody from Sanjay Dutt and Suniel Shetty to Abhishek Bachchan and Zayed Khan to head the line-up, which also includes Shilpa Shetty, Esha Deol, Dia Mirza and Raima Sen, is something else altogether. And it all started with Sanjay. ?I met him and asked for a three-minute narration time,? recalls Anubhav. ?And I don?t remember what I had said in those three minutes, but Sanju not only agreed to do the film, but called up Abhishek and put me through to Nitin Manmohan. I didn?t even realise and the film became so big.?

 Esha Deol

Dus is about the fight between a dreaded terrorist Jamwal and the Indian anti-terrorist cell headed by deputy inspector general Siddhant (Sanjay), and comprising Shashank (Abhishek), Aditi (Shilpa) and Aditya (Zayed). Giving the team support on foreign turf are Canadian police officers Dan (Suniel) and Neha (Esha). Dia and Raima play love interests in the film. Dus also stars Pankaj Kapoor (who returns after his intense Abbaji in Maqbool) and Gulshan Grover.

 Catchy pen-sketches define the 10 characters. While Abhishek?s Shashank ?doesn?t ask too many questions, doesn?t take no for an answer?, Zayed?s Aditya ?flirts with bombshells ? the deadlier the better?. Shilpa?s Aditi is ?solid as a rock and soft as a cuddle? while Esha ?makes it her business to be at the right place at the right time?. 

 While the multistarrer boasts of cool one-liners, it is the dhoom-dhadaka which does most of the talking. ?I wouldn?t call Dus an action film at all,? argues Anubhav. ?I choose to call it an intrigue film. As a viewer you are going to be intrigued throughout the movie. There?s some surprise springing up every 10 minutes.?

 Anubhav Sinha 

Even though there has been a lot of talk of Anubhav remaking the unfinished Mukul Anand film, which was also called Dus, this multistarrer has nothing to do with the Anand dream. ?They are completely different except the fact that both the films had Sanjay and Shilpa in the line-up.? The ladies, who apart from playing toughies have romantic sub-plots to cater to, make brief appearances. But Anubhav stresses that the women?s characters have more depth than time on screen.

 The music of the film, which has already created quite a stir on the racks of music stores with the title track becoming a peppy chartbuster, has been scored by the talented duo of Vishal and Shekhar with Ranjit Barot chipping in with a couple of numbers. 

 Post-Dus, Anubhav goes on a different plane altogether, helming the Sanjay Dutt-Amisha Patel-starrer Tathastu about a young middle-class couple having to overcome red tape at the hospital once their child falls ill. For a man who has made around 80 music videos before turning to celluloid, to actually conceive a songless movie like Tathastu is actually like entering a whole new world.

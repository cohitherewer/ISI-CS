 Stillborn triggers mayhem 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The superintendent of NRS Medical College and Hospital was heckled and his office ransacked on Monday afternoon, as a fallout of a ?stillborn? delivery.

 Bulbul Pal, 24, a resident of Sukanto Sarani, under Beleghata police station, was admitted to the antenatal ward on September 23. According to deputy superintendent Dilip K. Jha, she gave birth to a stillborn girl at 7 am on Sunday.

 A mob of around 60 entered superintendent B. Khan?s office at 2 pm on Monday, heckled him, broke chairs and tore up the papers on his table. The mob alleged that the ?baby died because of medical negligence?.

 Jha said the mob assaulted three hospital employees, who tried to stop the mayhem in the superintendent?s room.

 ?A case of vandalism has been lodged with Entally police station and three persons have been arrested. We have started an investigation,? said Vineet Goyel, deputy superintendent of police, eastern suburban division.

 Bulbul alleged that she was taken to the operating theatre after she went into labour, but was left unattended. ?Suddenly, one nurse came and said the baby was stillborn.?

 Deputy superintendent Jha said a mob had entered the ward where the woman was admitted on Sunday and tried to assault ward master Narayan Das, who fled.

 A man then called up Khan from the ward and asked him to come over to the hospital.

 ?Someone called me up and demanded that I immediately visit the hospital. But I refused, as I did not have the keys to my office and also because I did not want a ruckus in the ward, where many critical patients were admitted,? Khan claimed.

 Apart from the police probe, the hospital authorities, too, will inquire into the case. The baby?s body has been sent for post-mortem.

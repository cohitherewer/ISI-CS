 Brick shield for Lakes

 - Court orders state, railway to erect wall till settler eviction

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 A wall will stand between the waters and the settlers off the Dhakuria Lakes.

 That is the solution till the eviction, proposed by a division bench, comprising Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice A.K. Ganguly, after consulting both the state government and Eastern Railway lawyers.

 The court, however, made it clear on Friday that this was a temporary measure. The order of the Supreme Court would have to be carried out and the squatters evicted from land along Rabindra Sarobar, the bench stressed.

 ?We are trying to save the Lakes till the eviction is carried out,? the judges explained.

 The court has decided that two brick walls will be constructed between the railway tracks and Rabindra Sarobar, so that no squatter can gain entry into the Lake area and pollute the waters.

 The cost of the walls, built back to back to block off the waters from the illegal settlements, would be shared by the state government and the railway authorities.

 The bench has also proposed that both the state and the railways provide security guards to ensure that the walls are not breached.

 The railway authorities must identify the real settlers and arm them with a card so that after the eviction drive, they can claim alternative accommodation.

 Responding to a plea by railway lawyer R.N. Das, the court also agreed to appoint a special officer, preferably a high-ranking policeman, to roll out the plan.

 ?You think over the matter and we will pass the final order on Monday,? the bench told the lawyers.

 The judges also addressed police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee: ?We have asked you to attend court so that you are aware about the scheme we are going to implement to save the Lakes. You will have to take an active part to implement the scheme.?

 A week ago, the division bench had rapped the state government for its failure to carry out the apex court?s eviction order. The bench had asked the government to file a report stating its reasons.

 In the report submitted before the court on Friday, the government stated that the eviction drive was aborted to avoid bloodshed.

 But the state government, in the same report, assured the bench that the apex court?s order would be carried out following negotiations with the settlers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The rising son

 A K-soap without commercial breaks? Unthinkable it may be, but it?s happening all right, on Monday, as Kasautii Zindagii Kay will play non-stop for 34 minutes, 8.30 pm onwards. In this special episode number 868, Prerna and Aporna keep fighting over Yudi aka Prem, throwing challenges at each other with every swish-pan of the camera.

 More than anything else, all eyes are now on Prerna who gets to play mother for the first time, having gone through many an agnipariksha as a wife. Like with most of the big ones from Ekta?s K-factory, Prerna?s every move will be closely followed by mothers across the country and before you know, she may become the model mother.

 ?My mother will be very strict but would never give any lecture or indulge in rona-dhona,? says Shweta Tiwari, who plays Prerna in Kasautii? ?She wants to rectify her son first and then be good to him. There?s also the emotional factor of getting her son back after all these years.?

For young Manoj Bohra, who plays son Prem, it?s a whole new Ektaa world where moms and dads are a couple of years older. ?For me, despite such a small age difference, Shweta was always my mom since we acted out a scene first before we got introduced to each other,? Manoj tells Metro on the sets of Kasautii...

 And finally, for Cezanne ?Anurag? Khan, this new twist in the tale is a welcome one. ?Anurag?s a part of Prem just like Prerna and like all other problems, Anurag and Prerna will be able to rectify their brat son too,? he smiles.

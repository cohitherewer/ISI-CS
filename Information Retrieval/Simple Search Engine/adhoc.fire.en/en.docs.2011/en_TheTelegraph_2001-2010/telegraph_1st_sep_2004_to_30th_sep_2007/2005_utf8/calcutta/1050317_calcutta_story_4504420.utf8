The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

?It?s the idea that makes a film big or small?

After a stint with science and business management, 

MOHIT SURI is doing what he wants make movies. He spoke to Pratim D. 

Gupta about his directorial debut Zeher, his inspiration Anurag Basu and his 

refusal to toe the Mallika line

From a science student to a business management 

graduate to a film-maker, and all this at 23?

(Laughs). Yes, I was a science student at Jain 

College here in Mumbai. After Class XII, all my friends went for engineering courses. 

I had the marks for it, too. But then I thought why do something which everyone 

around is doing? I was planning to go for some foreign course abroad. Then, I 

enrolled for a business management course at a Mumbai college. While I was studying 

business management, my uncle Mukesh Bhatt asked me to do some work at his office. 

Initially, I agreed in order to earn some pocket money. But then I met Vikram 

Bhatt, who wanted me to help him in the making of Kasoor. After I assisted 

him for that film, I realised that film-making is something I would want to do 

for the rest of my life.

 After Kasoor, no Vikram Bhatt film was 

complete without you?

I assisted him in as many as eight films including 

hits like Raaz and Awara Paagal Deewana. After all this assisting, 

I realised there was no more growth for me and that I had to go out on my own. 

I started writing Zeher.

 You also had to finish Anurag Basu?s Tumsa 

Nahin Dekha after he was detected with leukemia?

Yes. It was a Bhatt production. I have been born and 

brought up in this company. When Anurag fell ill it was an absolute crisis situation 

with more than 30 per cent of the film still incomplete. Someone had to finish 

it. Mahesh uncle was in Switzerland then. So at one day?s notice, without knowing 

the script at all, I was thrown into the director?s chair.

 Don?t you regret that your first directorial assignment 

came in the form of someone else?s creation?

Not at all. Anurag Basu is one of my favourite people. 

He has been very inspiring. When I handled the production for Murder, I 

got to learn so many things from him. So despite not getting any credit for the 

film or any kind of salary, I have no regrets of being a part of Tumsa Nahin 

Dekha.

 What is Zeher all about?

Zeher is about the various interpersonal relationships 

between a man and a woman, which are usually hidden behind closed doors. It is 

about the domestic violence that is now very common among young couples. It?s 

not that there is a lack of love, but just that things like ego creep into the 

relationship. I had a real-life inside on this with one of my cousin?s marriages 

not working out since she didn?t want to be someone?s ?Mrs?. So I added an intelligent 

crime story to that premise. Zeher is about this man who loves his wife 

but wants her to be at home. She cannot take that and moves out. The man cannot 

get over it and goes on to meet another woman, who too is on the edge after a 

troubled marriage. What follows after that is how they all get involved in a crime.

 Emraan and Udita Goswami in Zeher

 Was your leading man Emraan Hashmi a forced choice, 

being your cousin?

I have seen him perform on the sets of Footpath 

and Murder. He is, of course, my cousin but to me, Emraan looks the 

modern man who can portray the many virtues of a real character, not necessarily 

a grey character. He was perfect to play a man who loves his wife yet is aware 

of his limitation of holding her back in the house.

 What about Shamita Shetty and Udita Goswami?

As far as Shamita is concerned, I wanted to break 

away from her item-girl image. I wanted her to look like the new woman of today 

who loves to take care of her husband at home but also doesn?t mind going to a 

party. Udita is a nice and sweet girl and I wanted her to look different from 

what she did in Paap. She plays this very difficult character of a woman 

who loves a man unconditionally knowing that there?s no future.

 But the teasers suggest there are bold scenes 

too?

I do not want to promote Zeher as a skin or 

sleaze flick. There are some sequences between these two people whose relationship 

is doomed from day one. They know they can?t be together but make most of the 

time they get to be with each other.

 Don?t you fear that Zeher may go down like 

recent small films like Rog?

I think that these days it is the idea that makes 

the film big or small. I would like to believe that Zeher is a big film. 

It has the music, locations and passion to beat any top star-cast film. Yes, Zeher 

is made with a realistic budget because that?s how we make our films. We don?t 

like the excess fat.

 What was this big fuss about ousting Mallika Sherawat 

from Zeher?

I had Mallika in mind for another script that I was 

working on which I had titled Zeher. She had her own agenda and wanted 

to change the script. But I am the sort of person who wouldn?t like someone else 

to dictate terms.

 What next after Zeher?

There are two films in the pipeline. One is called 

Blue Film about the sleaze film racket starring Kunal Kemu, who acted in 

Zakhm, and Deepal Shah. The other film, starring Emraan, is called Showbiz, 

about how people pay a heavy price for being famous.

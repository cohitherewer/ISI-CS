The hunt is on for the best new live band in town. And Wednesday is D-day for the five shortlisted acts as they audition before musicians Nondon Bagchi and Anjan Dutt, and rock journalist Sam Lall for Boom-Bass-Stick: The Band Hunt, presented by The Telegraph Metro and Someplace Else, for a lucrative contract to perform at The Parks pub.

 Being the inaugural year, it has been a mixed response. Theres a lot of enthusiasm but what the bands need is a more professional attitude, says Anjan Dutt. Well be looking for the most professional sound.

 Well also look at how the bands play original music and how they conduct themselves on stage, offers Lall, executive editor of Rock Street Journal. And the winner may just be invited for a stint in Delhis active pub culture, adds Lall.

 Heres a look at the soon-to-be-famous five.

 Rise from the Ashes

 Members: Neil Mansukhani, Shams Reza, Atanu Sarkar, Pranab Bera, Mohammed Imran Khan, Aniruddha Shom, Ignatius Rozario. 

 Genre of music: Soft pop rock.

 Plays only original music because it doesnt make sense to glorify bands that are already popular, by singing their covers. Band members aged 18 to 30 rehearse every day and have played in venues as varied as art galleries and childrens museums. Scheduled to perform Patience and Best Is Yet to Come at auditions on Wednesday.

 Camouflage 

 Members: Rajarshi Roy, Avik Sarkar, Soumitra Rakshit, Suvodeep Guha, Premjeet Dutta. 

 Genre of music: Alternative and Classic. 

 Formed as recently as January 2005, the band mostly comprises students, with the drummer being a full-time musician. They like to play alternative music, performing covers of Coldplay, Travis and Maroon5, besides staples like Dire Straits, Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin. It has a few original tunes on its playlist, but will perform Dire Straits Sultans of Swing and Maroon5s She Will Be Loved at the auditions.

 Crystal Grass 

 Members: Rohit Nandi, Tanya Sen, Bodhisattwa Ghosh, Souvik Gupta, Prosanto Mahanto, Rahul Mehra.

 Genre of music: Blues Rock.

 Some of the members of this band are a part of another act. Then why form Crystal Grass? We wanted to jam together for our own pleasure, is the frank admission. Influences range from Janis Joplin to Fleetwood Mac and Muddy Waters to Johnny Lee Hooker. Yet to start composing originals, Crystal Grass would be wooing the judges with renditions of Drowning in the Sea of Love and Black Velvet.

 Om 

 Members: Tuhin Mukherjee, Tirthankar Majumdar, Debjyoti Roy, Sougat Paul, Amitava Bhowmik. 

 Genre of music: Classic Rock.

 Comprising a doctor, an engineer and a banker, this seven-year-old band even has an album under its belt ? but in Bengali. We just want to make music and language is no barrier, says Om. The Wednesday auditions would see them performing original compositions Tears of the Beast and a freewheeling jam called Enjoy. Future plans involve making music for the fun of it, and an album of original material in English.

 Jack Rabbit 

 Members: Sayatya Mallick, Utsav Guhathakurta, Inam Hussain, Shion Guha, Ananda Gupta, Ronnie Prakash Koran.

 Genre of music: Progressive Blues.

 Named after a restaurant in Quentin Tarantinos Pulp Fiction, this line-up of college students was formed less than a year ago when the friends decided to let their musical creativity loose. The band is inspired by the likes of the Rolling Stones, B. B. King and Dire Straits. But we dont play their covers? just a guitar lick or two in our compositions occasionally, clarifies Jack Rabbit. On the audition day list are Cranberries Zombie and an original, Smokin It Up.

 Fencing in avian guests 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The forest department has started erecting fences around Santragachhi jheel, in Howrah, to protect thousands of migratory birds that have already started arriving at the waterbody from Siberia and northern parts of the Himalayas. These birds have often fallen prey to poachers. 

 ?We have got Rs 20 lakh for erection of fences around the waterbody and the work has already started,? said Joydeb Mukherjee, district forest officer (DFO) of Howrah on Friday. The department was expecting more funds to complete the fencing that will also protect the waterbody from pollution.

 Already, different types of migratory birds, like lesser whistling teal, large whistling teal, red-headed poacher, gargeny, spot bill duck and shoveller have reached the jheel and are likely to stay on till February-end. All these birds hail from Siberia and the northern parts of the Himalayas. 

 The birds usually arrive at the 10-hectare waterbody in mid-November and stay there till February-end. The forest department, after erecting the fences, will try to employ security personnel for the protection of the avian guests.

 DFO Mukherjee said children of local schools are being involved to campaign against poaching. ?We will soon put up signboards with detailed descriptions of these birds and their biological names for the benefit of visitors,? he added. 

 Atanu Raha, chief conservator of forests, said on Friday he had submitted a project to the Union ministry of forest and environment on the overall development of the lake. 

 ?We have submitted a Rs 1-crore plan to protect the jheel. We are expecting a positive response from the Union ministry,? Raha added.

 Shanties around the jheel have been removed and the waterbody has been declared a plastic-free zone. After completion of the fencing, the lake will be declared a protected area.

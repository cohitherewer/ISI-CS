The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Budget carrier aims high

 NISHA LAHIRI

 Months before its second birthday and despite glitches galore, India?s first low-cost carrier is aiming high, with special emphasis on the east.

 Air Deccan officials arrived in Calcutta on Wednesday evening to finalise details for 16 new flights from the city by mid-June, to destinations like Aizawl, Agartala, Bhubaneswar, Jamshedpur and Mumbai. The airline presently has five flights from the city.

 ?We have been doing surprisingly well in Calcutta,? says John K. Kuruvilla, chief revenue officer and head, commercial, Air Deccan. ?A lot of people had reservations when we came to this region, especially about the timings of the flights, in the afternoons and evenings, but I know just how price-conscious this market is. Customers here don?t want luxury, they want value for money.?

 Despite flights from Calcutta sometimes being grounded, and sometimes being cancelled, bookings on the daily flights to Chennai, Delhi, Guwahati and Dibrugarh are ?100 per cent almost every day?, while those to Hyderabad are ?close? to full up.

 The teething trouble, clearly, doesn?t seem to deter Calcuttans from flying low cost ? as low as Rs 4,521 to Delhi, Rs 5,100 to Chennai or Rs 2,791 to Guwahati, in last-day fares.

 ?We are not really competition for anyone, since we have created a new segment ? the trade traveller. That?s our target category. So, we have actually grown the market by two to 11 per cent, differing from region to region,? adds Kuruvilla.

 Other existing players refuse to read much into the Air Deccan numbers just yet, but a dozen-odd budget airlines are poised to take wings in the remaining months of 2005 and crowd the low-cost skies.

 Says Sanjoy Sett, chairman, eastern region, Travel Agents Association of India: ?So far, Air Deccan hasn?t really had competition. But things will hot up once Spice Jet and Go Airways start services.?

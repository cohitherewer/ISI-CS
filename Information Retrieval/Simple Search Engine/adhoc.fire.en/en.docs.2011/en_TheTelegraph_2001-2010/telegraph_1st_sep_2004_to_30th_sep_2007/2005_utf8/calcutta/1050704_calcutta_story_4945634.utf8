 Incessant rain since Sunday morning disrupted traffic in the city and its adjoining areas. However, the day being a holiday, not many were inconvenienced. 

 The weatherman has predicted that the wet spell will continue for at least another 24 hours.

 According to meteorological officials, several factors have influenced the continuous downpour. 

 The westward shift of the depression that had formed over the Bay of Bengal on June 26 is one of them. On Sunday, the depression lay over east Madhya Pradesh. The monsoon trough also stretched over Gangetic West Bengal to north-east Bay of Bengal.

 ?In addition,? said G.C. Debnath, director of the weather section at Regional Meteorological Centre, Alipore, ?there are two upper-air cyclonic circulations. One of them is spread over central Gangetic West Bengal and its neighbourhood, at an altitude of 3.1 km above sea level. The other stretches across parts of the Bay of Bengal, south Bengal and Orissa, at an altitude of 7.6 km over sea level.?

 The rain was caused by a combination of all these factors and there are chances of heavy showers in a couple of pockets in south Bengal, added Debnath. 

 There are already reports of heavy rain in Bihar. 

 The rain led to waterlogging in several parts of the city, especially the low-lying areas. BB Ganguly Street, Ultadanga, Maniktala, Naktala, Bansdroni, Gariahat, Topsia, Tangra and Tiljala were the worst-hit. The waterlogging hampered traffic movement. 

 Calcutta Municipal Corporation officials said no major traffic snarls were reported, as most people preferred to remain indoors. 

 Calcutta Tramways Company officials reported that trams on many routes had to be temporarily suspended due to the rain and waterlogging. Trams did not ply along BB Ganguly Street, MG Road, Jorasanko and College Street, among other roads.

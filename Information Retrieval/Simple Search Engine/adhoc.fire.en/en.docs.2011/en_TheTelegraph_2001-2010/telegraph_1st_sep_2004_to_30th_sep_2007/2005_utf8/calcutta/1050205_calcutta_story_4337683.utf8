Zeeshan Jawed, Himika Chaudhuri

Another 

beauty salon for those addicted to looking good. K?Ron?s at 191, Park Street, 

is the latest entrant in the beauty business with a promise to make looking good 

easy.

 ?Our forte is hair styling,? says Lily Leong of her second outlet in the city, the first being on Sarat Bose Road.

 Having been a hair stylist with various star hotels in Mumbai, Lily, with 20 years experience in the profession, is all set to deck ?em up with new styles. ?Hair styling is the USP of my parlour and though our cuts are a little expensive, it?s worth the money,? promises Lily.

 The plush 1,000-sq-ft salon near Park Circus offers the entire range of beauty-related services ? facials, waxing, manicures, pedicures and hair treatments.

Grecian grub

 Greek cuisine means marrying flavour and aroma, the crisp tang of traditional seasonings and fresh ingredients extracted from land and sea.

 Bringing the freshness of Mediterranean cuisine to Calcutta is Marco Polo at 205 Sarat Bose Road. The Indian, Tandoori and Continental speciality restaurant is hosting a Greek food festival between February 4 and 14.

 ?Fried and spicy food would get first preference with the people of Calcutta. But with awareness and exposure, people are recognising the virtues of healthy and less spicy food. This is the right time to give Calcuttans a taste of Greek food,? says Kallol Banerjee, manager of the restaurant.

 The basic medium of cooking is olive oil and spices are sparse. This characteristic of the cuisine makes it perfect for the palate of all health freaks. Savour the Brocolo Soupa (broccoli soup) and Soupa Avgolemono (chicken soup with eggs and lemon). 

 On the salad front, the Salata Horiatiki (tomatoes, lettuce, feta cheese with lemon olive oil dressing) and Salata Athenas (thinly sliced cucumber and radish spruced up with wine vinegar, salt and oregano) are definitely worth a try. 

 Appetisers and dips include Saut?ed Mushrooms (button mushrooms saut?ed with garlic, olive oil and red wine and finished with lemon juice) and Loukamika (grilled pork sausages flavoured with oregano).

 The wide main course section includes items like Mixed Vegetable Gremolada (garlic saut?ed exotic vegetables with gremolada and accompanied with steamed pilaff), Psari Sti Skara (grilled bekti served with lemon and oregano sauce) and Moussaka (rich herb-flavoured minced lamb and baked eggplants).

 The Greek Style Spaghetti (with sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, broccoli, red peppers, pine nuts, basil and cheese) and Penna (pasta in garlic tomato sauce, chicken, feta cheese and antichokes) are recommended pasta items. 

 The desserts include Karithopita (walnut cake), Sika Sto Fourna (baked figs) and Baklava (crushed nuts in a pastry with syrup). 

 The prices range between Rs 125 and Rs 325.

 Cool comfort

 As we approach the second quarter of the year, the hunt for the best air conditioners in town is just weeks away. To give Calcuttans an alternative in the white goods market, Avi launched its range of air-conditioners at The Park on February 2.

 ?The comprehensive range of air conditioners marks our debut in the consumer durables category of the white goods market,? said managing director Major Raj Sahai. 

 With Texport Electronics Limited, an Indo-Swiss joint venture, owning the Avi brand, the aesthetic concepts developed by Basile of Italy ?meets all European norms?. 

 The special features include nano filters, power-saving and the fast cooling mode. The air conditioners also come with power-heating functions. 

 The company even plans to come up with other household products in future.

 With prices starting at Rs 8,900, the air-conditioners will be available in exclusive stores like Capital Electronics, Peerless Bazaar and Harmony House.

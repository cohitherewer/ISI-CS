 Rescued from hotel

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Priyanka Singha Roy, 18, allegedly kidnapped from her residence at gunpoint by three men last Saturday, was rescued by Howrah police from a hotel in Orissa early on Wednesday.

 Last Saturday, according to the statement made to police by Priyanka?s mother Purnima Singha Roy, the three men, armed with revolvers and daggers, stormed their house and took Priyanka away. No male member of the family was present.

 ?She was rescued and her neighbour Sanjay Mandal was arrested in a hotel at Chandaneswar, in Orissa,? said Basab Dasgupta, additional superintendent of police (rural), Howrah.

 According to a complaint lodged by Priyanka?s father, three men arrived in a car at their residence at Raypara, in the Uluberia police station area, around 8 pm and kidnapped the girl at gunpoint. The complaint held Priyanka?s neighbour Sanjay Mandal responsible for the abduction.

 Acting on a tip-off, a six-member team of Uluberia police raided the hotel in Chandaneswar and found Sanjay and Priyanka in a room. Sanjay was arrested and Priyanka detained for questioning. They were brought back and grilled throughout Wednesday.

 Dasgupta, who conducted the rescue operation, said the girl told the police that Sanjay had forcibly taken her to Digha and then to the hotel at Chandaneswar.

 ?Sanjay was with her when we rescued her. He spent two nights with the girl in two hotels in Digha. Then, they moved on to Chandaneswar and spent another night in the hotel that we raided last night. Three persons have been arrested so far. We are looking for the fourth,? Dasgupta said.

 Police have found a number of loose ends in Priyanka?s statements and have found a number of love letters that were exchanged between Priyanka and Sanjay. 

 ?She had another relationship before she became close with Sanjay. That boyfriend was beaten up by her neighbours,? a police said.

 According to a neighbour of Priyanka?s, she broke off her relationship with Sanjay a few months ago and her family was preparing to marry her off.

 ?We are not ruling out any possiblilities,? Mihir Bhattacharya, Howrah superintendent of police, had said after Priyanka?s disappearance. 

 Police clarified that the abduction could well have been staged.

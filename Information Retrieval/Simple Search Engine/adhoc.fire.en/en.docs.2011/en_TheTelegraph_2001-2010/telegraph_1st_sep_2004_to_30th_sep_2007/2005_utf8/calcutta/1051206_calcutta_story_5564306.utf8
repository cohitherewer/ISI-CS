 The City Diary

 More than 250 unauthorised structures were demolished in Salt Lake Sector V, the IT hub of the state, on Monday. Bidhannagar Municipality and police conducted the drive in which 200 shanties and more than 50 makeshift shops were pulled down. Police said many of the unauthorised structures had become dens for criminals. Similar drives will also be taken up in other parts of Salt Lake, civic officials said.

 A fresh charge of cheating has been brought against lawyer Pinaki Banerjee, who was arrested earlier for duping a person of Rs 6 lakh. Police said the second ?forgery? came to light after a woman, Ajminder Singh, a resident of BT Road, lodged a complaint alleging that Banerjee had duped her of Rs 3 lakh. Ajminder said she was trying to get a visa to visit her husband, Sukhbinder Singh Sunnat, in Canada. She had approached Banerjee and his associate Dilip Das for help. Banerjee took Rs 34 lakh from her for filing a case in the high court. After a few months, he and Das told her that they would move the Supreme Court. Later, when Ajminder inquired about the status of the case, they told her that the apex court had rejected the petition. The woman then wanted her money back, but they refused. She then lodged a complaint with the detective department. Das is yet to be arrested.

 Eight persons were injured in a clash in Bibibagan, in Entally, late on Sunday. Two of them were admitted to NRS Medical College and Hospital. Nine persons have been arrested.

On Sunday night, as soon as he parked his vehicle, some local residents asked him to remove it. Asraf refused. As an altercation broke out, Asraf was joined by friends. Both groups then attacked each other with bricks and bottles. The mob ransacked Asrafs house and a shop.

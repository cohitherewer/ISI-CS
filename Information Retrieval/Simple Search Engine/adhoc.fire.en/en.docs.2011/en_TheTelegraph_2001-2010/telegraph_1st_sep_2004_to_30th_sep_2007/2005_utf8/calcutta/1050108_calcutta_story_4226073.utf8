 Football life-saver in the outfield

 - Mobile medical unit at Salt Lake stadium to prevent on-field fatalities

 SUBHRO SAHA

Jolted by the Christiano Junior tragedy, the Indian Football Association (IFA) has tied up with Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals and Apollo Health amp; Lifestyle Ltd for a mobile medical unit to be stationed at the Salt Lake stadium. The goal is to address serious sports injuries and prevent on-field fatalities.

 To be flagged off by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in the presence of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee before the East Bengal-Mohun Bagan lung-opener of the National Football League (NFL) on January 12, the special ambulance, provided by Apollo Gleneagles, will stand by during all NFL matches this season.

 ?We were planning to augment our on-ground medical facilities by adding a mobile unit fitted with life-saving equipment and personnel to our existing services of two basic ambulances. The Junior incident was an eye-opener and we are glad to be associated with Apollo for this facility,? IFA honorary secretary Subrata Dutta told Metro on Friday.

 The hospital, located bang opposite Yuva Bharati Krirangan, has also been named official healthcare associate of the IFA. 

 ?We will provide qualified doctors, nurses and paramedics, along with the vehicle. Apollo will also offer complete support therapy on campus, should a player need it,? said S.N. Reddy, CEO, Apollo Gleneagles.

 From a multi-parameter cardiac monitor to a defibrillator (an apparatus that might have saved Junior?s life, feel doctors) to correct rhythm disturbances of the heart, airway support to cervical spine control, breathing aids to circulation boosters ? the mobile medical unit will be equipped with all resources to save lives (see graphic).

 ?The presence of a trained paramedic with proper resuscitation resources is absolutely crucial for buying time,? said Ramesh Sheshadhri, consultant cardio-thoracic and vascular surgeon, Apollo Gleneagles.

 The IFA, which has started compiling health dossiers of all its registered footballers, is confident of getting it right this time. 

 ?We are trying to streamline our medical resources to reach the best possible care to our affiliates. All our players and referees have been brought under insurance cover and we are trying to provide critical inputs through seminars and workshops,? said Dutta.

 With medical preparedness at city grounds in sharper focus than ever before, in the wake of the Brazilian?s tragic demise, East Bengal Club, too, is trying to get a special ambulance rolling on the same day, said an official.

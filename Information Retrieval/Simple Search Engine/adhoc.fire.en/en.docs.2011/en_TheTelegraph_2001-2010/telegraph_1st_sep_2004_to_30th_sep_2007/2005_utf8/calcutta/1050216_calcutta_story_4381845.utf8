 Ground committee convenor, Book Fair

 Last year, we caught a thief in a stall who had taken up a challenge from his girlfriend to remove a book from a stall unobserved. In such cases, there is no question of being lenient in treatment towards them. He did not lack the means and could very well have bought the book. No thefts were reported this year. We had posted security people in plain clothes on behalf of the guild on the grounds. They were keeping an eye on all sorts of thefts ? be it books, cell phones or wallets.

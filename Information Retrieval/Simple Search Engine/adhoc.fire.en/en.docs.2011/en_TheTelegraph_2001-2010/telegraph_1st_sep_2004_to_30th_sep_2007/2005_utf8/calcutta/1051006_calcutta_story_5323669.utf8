 Kurry Klub, that started serving its unique fusion platter of Italian, Mexican and Oriental fare 12 years back on Lansdowne Road, has now forayed into the north of Calcutta. The 60-cover eatery, serving a mix of Indian, Chinese and Italian cuisine, has opened its doors at Kankurgachhi (P-53, CIT Scheme-VII M).

 Pradip Rozario, formerly executive chef of Taj in Mumbai, who had kicked off the Lansdowne place, is again at the helm, with Ananda Pal of A-Akhee Anand Food amp; Beverage, who owns the property.

 We had been planning a second Kurry Klub at the Kankurgachhi property for a long time, and Im delighted it has finally taken off, since there wasnt anything similar this side of town, says Rozario. He had earlier launched KKs Fusion, the 90-cover restaurant-lounge offering a cross-culinary global trek, next to 89 Cinemas.

 Vivek Rathod of Salient, who has again provided the design solution (after KKs Fusion), has opted for a contemporary Oriental d?cor, an inclusive ambience with an extrovert character.

 Rathod has used imported synthetic jute panels and an illumination pattern that helps change the theme with subtle mood shifts.

 The compact show kitchen is merged with the main kitchen that runs along the full length of the restaurant, cutting delivery time.

 The intermediate pocket bar counter is designed to exhibit and dispense, and is tactfully used to segregate the family crowd from the liquor lot. Kankurgachhi is essentially a residential pocket, and we are getting a lot of family walk-ins, says Rozario.

 And the cuisine? We have kept mostly common, everyday items on the menu, those which are kind of perennial favourites, explains the chef.

 So there is Vegetable Pepper Salt and Drums of Heaven, Prawn Thermidor and Mutton Rogan Josh, Vegetable Dumplings in Chilli Soya Sauce and Dal Makhani. And, of course, a platter of pastas.

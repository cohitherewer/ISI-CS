Life

 Bali bound

 With Sabyasachi Mukherjee showcasing 

 at Milan and Anamika Khanna unveiling in London, international 

 fashion weeks are no longer a distant dream for Calcutta 

 designers. 

 The latest to join the global bandwagon is young designer Abhishek Dutta whos all set to showcase at the Bali Fashion Week next week.

 I am the only designer from India participating in the Bali Fashion Week this year. Itll be an honour to share the ramp with international acclaimed designer from Italy, Russia and the UK, says Dutta, whose show is slated for June 7.

 The collection Dutta will unveil draws inspiration from fairytales and is aptly titled Bedtime Story. But it isnt the opulence or ethereal feel of the fantasy world he hopes to capture. 

 The line catches the naughtiness and sex appeal of fairytale characters, smiles the designer.

 A street wear line targeted at south-east Asian and European markets, it features a lot of texturisation with hand-embroidery, bleach washes, enzyme washes and knits.

 About 60 per cent of the collection comprises wrapped skirts and cocktail dresses, draped in innovative techniques. 

 Since the collection is for Bali spring summer 2006, Ive used light fabrics like linen, cotton and stretch cotton, he adds. Duttas trademark leather work has been given a new twist with leather braids adorning the garments. 

 The palette focuses on pink, mango, sea green and turquoise, with touches of beige in all the pieces.

 Park Street and Camac Street are the party hubs of Calcutta. Any argument, anyone?

 If this belt never has a dull moment till well after midnight, most of the central business district is dark and deserted by dinner time. With one obvious exception.

 Amber, the multi-cuisine restaurant at 11 Waterloo Street, has long wooed diners with the aroma of its kebabs. Now, it is providing some music to the ears at its resto-bar Essence.

 Unveiled on Friday evening, the place is a combo meal of good food, good spirits and good music. I think lounges are the latest obsession. The regulars here would request a more chilled-out space with their food and drinks. So, we converted the second floor into a resto-bar. I am sure families would be very comfortable here, said Sanjay Khullar, director of the restaurant which has been on the Calcutta culinary map for the past 45 years. 

 The resto-bar takes up 3,000 sq feet with a lot of colourful wooden and marble finish. The place has a DJ console but no dance floor. 

 The cuisine is mainly Indian and continental, with signature dishes like Murgh Malai Kebab, Gosht Seekh Kebab, Keema Matar, Baked Fish Tomato and Spinach and Cheese Canneloni.

 Having taken a beating ever since dining destinations spread south and east, the resto-bar is an attempt to revive Amber as a popular dinner ? and not just lunch ? address, surmounting the minuses of parking problems and traffic trouble to get to the kitchen that has served the likes of Indira Gandhi and Dilip Kumar.

 Leggy lingo

 What could stepping out in short skirts bring you? Not just cool comfort or corny comments, but a free ticket to a disc and cocktails and mocktails on the house. Provided, of course, the nightclub youre entering believes in less being more.

 The Astors Cloud 9 hosted a party on Friday night with short skirts being the theme.

 The smaller the skirt, the bigger the prize. And that is due to the high level of excitement it generates. When we sent out invitations for this party, we received a tremendous response, said a spokesperson for the hotel. 

 The ladies who trooped in for the Short Skirts night carried them off with elan on the dance floor.

 The reactions from the boy brigade divided the crowd into the ? ogler (stand and stare, glass in hand, as if hes never seen a pair of female legs before); oversmart (the comment-pass-type); the groper (in the garb of a casual brush and a slimy Im soooo sorry) and the grumbler (Even we have legs to show, why dont they have shorts-only night for us).

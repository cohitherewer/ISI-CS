 Kin suspects in cash theft

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Bidhannagar police are probing the mysterious disappearance of Rs 2 lakh that a man had withdrawn from a bank in Salt Lake on Friday afternoon.

 Basudeb Banerjee, former employee of the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), had intended to invest the money in a post office scheme that would assure him of a monthly income for the rest of his life.

 On Friday, police detained five employees of a garage Banerjee had visited on his way back home with the money. ?We are interrogating them. We have also questioned Banerjee?s son and nephew, who had accompanied him to the bank, separately. There are inconsistencies in their statements,? said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas.

 Banerjee had reportedly set off from home around 1 pm on his motorcycle to withdraw the cash from United Bank of India?s Mayukh Bhavan branch. His son Bhashwar and nephew Jayanta had accompanied him on another two-wheeler. 

 ?He had planned to invest the cash under a monthly income scheme in a post office,? said an officer of Bidhannagar (North) police station. 

 ?After withdrawing the sum, when I came out of the bank, I noticed that the front tyres of the two motorcycles were punctured. I had a hunch that it must have been done purposefully,? Banerjee recounted. 

 The three men then started pushing the motorcycles towards a garage near CK market. ?The money was kept in the carrier-box of the two-wheeler with Bhashwar and Jayanta. Though the garage was a 20-minute walk from the bank, the duo reached there five minutes after Banerjee,? said the police officer.

 ?At the garage, Banerjee realised that the carrier-box was broken and the plastic packet, containing the cash, was missing,? the officer added.

 Art from Assam

 Keenly conscious of the emerging global trends in art, todays young artists are skilled in its technical nuances and the messages contained within them. The ongoing exhibition of paintings by Contemporary Artists Group of Assam reflects the younger generations heightened awareness of modern concepts of form and design, and provides a key to the changing thematic and stylistic mores in the field of the visual arts. Featuring paintings and prints by six promising artists, the show captures the essence of their individual creativity and, at the same time, finds them trying to imbibe elements in their art that bear the unmistakable stamp of international influence. Partly abstract and partly realistic in representation, the works on show express a common desire on the part of the artists to create an infinite, unified, artistic space that stretches beyond the limits of their frames or surfaces. Participating artists are Abanta Borah, Jyoti Kumar Kalita, Manika Devi, Subhakar Laskar, Prabin Kumar Nath and Aditi Chakravarty (Green Falls; picture above). Guest artist: Neel Pawan Barua.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 golden retreat

 - eye catcher

 ?It?s always a pleasure to come to Calcutta and this time all the more so since I?m inaugurating the International Women?s Film Festival,? said actress Sonali Kulkarni, in the city on Monday to kickstart the event at Swabhumi with other celebrities like Nafisa Ali Sodhi. Sonali had come down just a couple of months ago to promote her film Dansh with the rest of the cast of the Kanika Verma film. Riding high on the success of her role in the Italian film Fire At My Heart, Sonali also made a big splash at the International Film Festival of India at Goa a week ago after having walked the red carpet with celluloid legend Omar Shariff at the Venice International Film Festival. The actress is now awaiting the release of Milan Luthria?s Taxi No. 9211, where she has been cast opposite Nana Patekar. Picture by Aranya Sen

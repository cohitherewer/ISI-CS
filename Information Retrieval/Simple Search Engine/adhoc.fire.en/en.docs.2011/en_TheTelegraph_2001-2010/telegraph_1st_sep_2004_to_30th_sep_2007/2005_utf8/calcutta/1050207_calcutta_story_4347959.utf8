The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Of human bondage

A voice against injustice to women is how Rajeshwari 

Sachdeva describes the new Sony serial, Rihhaee. Aimed at fighting crime 

against women and bringing justice to those in despair, Rihhaee is a docu-drama. 

Set in an urban environment, it takes viewers into the lives of women suffering 

either physical or mental abuse and unable to fight for their own salvation.

 The weekly half-hour series will not only share the pain and trauma of hundreds of women, but will also end on a note of hope, as victims are set free and the perpetrators of the crimes are brought to justice. Each of these stories is a dramatised version of a real-life case, spread over two episodes, featuring popular telly stars like Gauri Pradhan, Gurdeep Kohli and Rushad Rana.

 At the heart of every story are the sustained efforts of NCCW (National Commission for Crimes Against Women) with such determined activists like Madhavi Rajput (played by Rajeshwari) and Anupam Sinha (played by Nakul Vaid, in picture right).

 ?Through three steps, we tackle every case in the serial. First we heal the victim, then we help her get justice and finally, we create awareness through the medium. Some of the cases, we know, are crimes. Others we have to ascertain whether they are criminal acts at all,? Rajeshwari tells Metro.

 While the serial is ?very commercial?, it is also trying to reach out to all those women suffering throughout the country. ?We do want our TRPs. But at the same time Rihhaee is much more than just a serial. We have created a helpline where people can call up and share their problems with us. Privacy does become important then and we may have to conceal identities. While we can?t sell people?s lives for our serial, we do have to talk about the problems.?

 On the essence of Rihhaee, producer Anurradha Prasad says: ?The show is very high on human interest and showcases dramatised landmark cases. We are sure that viewers will tune in and also join us fight crime against women.? The channel is equally optimistic about the show. Says Tarun Katial, executive vice president, Sony Entertainment Television: ?The show aims to transform television from being a medium of entertainment to a medium of serious information and social awareness. The USP of Rihhaee continues to be the verity and the passion.? 

 Rihhaee premieres on Wednesday and will be telecast every Wednesday and Thursday, at 10.30 pm, on Sony.

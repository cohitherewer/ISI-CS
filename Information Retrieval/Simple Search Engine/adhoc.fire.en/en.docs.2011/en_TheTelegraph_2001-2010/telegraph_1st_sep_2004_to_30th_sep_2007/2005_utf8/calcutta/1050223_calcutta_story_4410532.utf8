 Identity parade ahead for Roma

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The last time Roma Jhawar came face-to-face with Gunjan Ghosh was early on February 5, inside a red Maruti van.

 Almost three weeks later, at 10.30 am on Wednesday, Roma will confront Gunjan once again. He is to take part in the test identification parade at Dum Dum Central jail. 

 The 20-year-old college girl will be asked to identify all the arrested gang members, including Gunjan Ghosh, who had abducted her on the morning of February 4. Roma was on her way to college, along with four-year-old nephew Vedant and friend Sabari Mitra.

 The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) does not plan to ask Sabari, the other witness, to turn up for the parade. It will be held in the presence of a judicial magistrate. 

 In keeping with the rules, Roma?s parents will not be allowed to be with her. She will be provided back-to-back security ? right from the time she steps out of her Salt Lake CB block residence till the completion of the parade ? and the CID has worked on all the details to ensure that her identity remains undisclosed. 

 ?The girl will not be exposed at any cost. She is young and we are concerned about her well-being. We have held discussions with the jail department to ensure this,? said additional director-general of police (CID) R.K. Mohanty.

 According to insiders, Roma will be asked to sit in the presence of the judicial magistrate inside a special cell, with dark panes to ensure that only Roma can see the parade. 

 For the investigators, the parade remains the most crucial step among a series of moves leading to the filing of a chargesheet in the abduction case. Roma?s identification will justify the CID arrests in the eyes of the law. 

 The CID will send taped recordings of Gunjan?s voice demanding ransom for spectrographic tests.

 On Tuesday, two gang members, Guddu and Munna, made confessional statements before the judicial magistrate in Salt Lake. The process, that started at around noon, lasted over four hours. 

 The CID has learnt that in his confession before the judicial magistrate, Gunjan has claimed that on the night of the kidnap, it was Pappu, and not he, who had gunned down Arvind Bhai. 

 Besides, Gunjan said he was an accomplice, but it was Arvind who worked out the details of the kidnap. He was just a cog in the wheel, he claimed.

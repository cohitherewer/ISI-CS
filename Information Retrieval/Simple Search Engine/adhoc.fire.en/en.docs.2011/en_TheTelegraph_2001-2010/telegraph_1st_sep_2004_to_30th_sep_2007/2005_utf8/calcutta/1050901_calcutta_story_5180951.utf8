 Sleuths step in for probe

 - Property dispute whiff in the killing of Baguiati couple

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on Wednesday initiated an inquiry into the murder of the Biswases in their Baguiati flat. Police are already probing the case. 

 During the day, a three-member CID team visited the flat, where the bodies of the couple were found early on Monday. 

 Since there was hardly any sign of resistance being put up by the two, police suspect that the couple was drugged or poisoned before being murdered. 

 According to the cops, the murderers had later stabbed the bodies and hit them with blunt objects.

 The theory can only be ascertained once the post-mortem reports are available. 

 Preliminary investigations suggest that a property dispute could have led to the murder. 

 A two-member police team reached Behrampore on Tuesday morning to look into the family?s background.

 Narayan Biswas, the murdered husband, ran a nursery in Behrampore before moving into the rented flat in Narayantala, in Baguiati, with his wife.

 Their painter son Sumanta lived with them. The two daughters are married. They live with their families nearby. 

 The couple was found dead in the bedroom of their ground-floor flat. A sum of Rs 35,000 in cash, kept in a box in the room, was missing. 

 The couple had shifted from Behrampore 14 months ago. They sold off their nursery to a local youth for Rs 1.25 lakh, the police have found out. 

 Sumanta told investigators that his parents only received Rs 65,000 from the nursery deal and the legalities of the sale were yet to be completed.

 ?We are yet to interrogate the son properly, since he is busy with the last rites,? said Praveen Kumar, district police superintendent.

 Police feel several unanswered questions could hold the key to the murder. 

 ?For instance, domestic help Lakshmi Das did not turn up on Monday morning. She provided some vital clues. We?re preparing a list of local burglars who might lead us to the killers,? said an investigating officer. 

 Sumanta?s statement to the police ? that he had woken up much earlier than usual on Monday morning ? is being viewed with suspicion.

 Only one splotch of blood on the bed has also vexed the investigators.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Rainy revelry

 Creating a sensational splash on the citys weekend party scene is the annual Tolly Monsoon Bash, the most eagerly awaited and exciting event of the season. Organised by The Telegraph along with Spandan, the evening celebrates the spirit of youthful joie-de-vivre associated with the rains. Guests will be treated to a veritable deluge of unending entertainment, by singing, dancing and partying the night away. Hosting the party in her own charismatic, inimitable style will be MTV VJ Sophia Choudhury. DJ Akash, in charge of the turntables, will regale the crowd with popular re-mixes and house numbers, right into the wee hours of the morning. Indi-pop diva Shibani Kashyap (picture left) will sing the latest chartbusters and a selection from her super-hit albums. Besides, there will be 10,000 watts of non-stop music with high-tech psychedelic lights, played next to a large, inviting dance floor, for young and young-at-heart couples to shake a leg! If that is not enough, artificial rainfall and water sprinklers add to the fun and romance of the affair. Last, but not the least, a delectable array of sumptuous food, snacks and spirits, promises to whet your appetite for more entertainment.

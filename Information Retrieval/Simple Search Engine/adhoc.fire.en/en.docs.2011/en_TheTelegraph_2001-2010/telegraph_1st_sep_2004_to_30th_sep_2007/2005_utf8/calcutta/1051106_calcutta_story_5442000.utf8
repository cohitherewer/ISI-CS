The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Next weekend you can be at ... 

Bahiri

 How many times have you gone to Digha or some other overcrowded town on the Midnapore coast for a weekend trip? Most of us will probably need another Sunday morning cup of tea to get the count right.

 And it?s a pity, since each time you?ve tried to escape the bustle of the city, you?ve missed a fabulous tryst with history as you drove past Marishda, 10 km from Contai. A detour from the town leads to Midnapore?s little-known tourist treasure ? Bahiri.

 The hamlet?s recent past is a chronicle of neglect. No wonder, tourists have ignored it for decades. 

 Bahiri?s status was not always like this. The village was once part of Hijli district in Orissa and occupied a prominent place not only in the cultural life of eastern India, but also in trade and commerce.

 A deserted temple, dating back to the Middle Ages, bears testimony to Bahiri?s golden past. The influence of the Orissa school of architecture is apparent in its construction.

 The two stone plaques narrate the temple?s history. Locals call it Deul. The similarities with the Jagannath temple of Puri are obvious.

 The Bahiri landmark has been included in the state government?s list of protected monuments, but apart from that it has attracted only apathy. The last renovation work was taken up years ago.

 The temple is surrounded by ancient banyan trees with tea stalls at their feet. A stroll down the village path will take you to Bhimsagar ? the largest man-made waterbody in the area.

 Bahiri secured its place in history books while this waterbody was being dug. Numerous antiques from the Sunga Kusana period were unearthed at the spot.

 Modern historians believed Bahiri was a vital hub of trade and commerce along the Bengal coast even before the birth of Christ.

 Troops of langurs populate the treetops of the village. The sight of screeching, bright green parakeets dashing across the azure sky and a kingfisher patiently preying in the water will take you to another world.

 Depending on the season, you will be dazzled by gulmohars in bloom or be mesmerised by the fresh fragrance of shiuli.

 Those looking for luxury would do best to avoid Bahiri. It is not a developed tourist destination. However, if you do not mind going without city comforts for a couple of days, there are few places as charming as this.

 Do not forget to sample the kaju sandesh before you head home. You will probably want to bring packets of the delicacy back to the city.

 Going: 

 Digha-bound buses from Calcutta stop at Marishda. Take a rickshaw or Trekker to Bahiri from there. The journey takes around half-an-hour. You can drive straight to Bahiri via Marishda. There is regular Trekker service from Bahiri to Contai 

 Staying: 

 There are decent hotels in Contai, which is about 15 km from Bahiri. Otherwise, you can stay at Digha, 40 km from Bahiri

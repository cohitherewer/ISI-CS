The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Dollars for green think tank

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta will soon boast Bengal?s first environment management institute. The first step in this direction was initiated recently with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) agreeing to grant a sum of $138,000 to conduct a feasibility study for setting up such an institute in Calcutta.

 ?If everything goes well, the institute will start functioning in two years? time,? said a senior environment department officer. 

 According to state environment secretary Asim Barman, the state environment department had placed a proposal with the ADB late last year. 

 ?An American consultant has been appointed after the amount was sanctioned by the bank,? Barman said on Sunday. Asked whether the ADB would finance the institute as well, Barman said: ?Whenever the ADB sponsors a study, it tries to invest in the project. We hope this will also lead to an investment proposal from it.? 

 The institute is likely to come up at New Town, Rajarhat.

 While conveying its approval to the chairman, West Bengal Pollution Control Board, the ADB observed that Bengal lacks a local think tank to advise the industry and the state government on the most efficient and cost-effective methods of solving problems related to pollution.

 ?In Bengal, most of the industries, as well as the state government, have to rely on the National Environmental Engineering Institute (NEERI) in Nagpur, Maharashtra, some 1,500 km away, for technical evaluation and solutions,? the ADB has noted.

 The proposed West Bengal Environmental Management Institute will act as a nodal referral institute for the whole of eastern and northeastern India. 

 It will undertake scientific studies, technical evaluation and policy research, in addition to providing advisory services to the government, judiciary as well as the industry. 

 It will also evaluate regional and local environmental impacts, promote state-of-the-art technology for adopting clean and climate-friendly environment management practices, technology transfer, as well as global networking with environmental services, information and technology providers. 

 The feasibility study will determine the institute?s planning strategies.

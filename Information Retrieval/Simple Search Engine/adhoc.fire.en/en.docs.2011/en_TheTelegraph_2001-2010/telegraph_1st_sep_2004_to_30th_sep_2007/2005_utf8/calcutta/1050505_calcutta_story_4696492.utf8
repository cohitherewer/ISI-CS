Chef Tapanee Sritarmai or Mama, as she is lovingly called by the staff of Pan Asian ? the speciality Oriental restaurant at ITC Sonar Bangla ? is cooking up a range of traditional Thai curries. From the fiery hot to the bland flavours, everything is on offer in the open kitchen of the premium restaurant.

 Titled Curry Never in a Hurry, the purpose of the week-long festival is to pamper guests with a new list of Thai home-made curries, which they can savour with plain rice or a range of fancy staples. 

 Try the red or green curry and sample the fish or garden-fresh veggies as part of the ingredients. ?It depends on how fiery you want your curry to be. It?s not as if red curry is hotter than the green curry; that can be controlled with the quantity and type of spices used,? said chef Tapanee.

 So, even as you order Gaeng Khua kung Sapparod or the popular Massaman Curry, you don?t have to be bothered if it?s green or yellow in colour. 

 Sample fish, chicken, prawn and even duck preparations, while the green brigade can hope to binge on some typical Thai vegetables that are imported from the Southeast Asian destination.

 Prices range between Rs 1,300 for a vegetarian meal for two and Rs 1,700 for a non-vegetarian meal for two, excluding taxes. The festival menu is available only for dinner on weekdays and both meals on weekends.

 Die for pie

 For all you sweet lovers in the city, By the Way at The Taj Bengal has whipped up a yummy Pies and Puddings fest, on for the month of May. 

 Fruit lovers can dig into Malva Pudding with brandy butter sauce, Fruit Compote and Banana Caramel ice cream, a South African delicacy that merges macerated fruits with brandy. Arabic speciality Basbusa, with orange Cointreau sauce and vanilla ice-cream, is a variation of a semolina and jaggery pudding with orange liquor. Then there is the Ginger Steamed Pudding with maple syrup and honey nut crunch ice-cream that uses the double-boiler method of steaming. 

 For pie die-hards there is the Citron Meringue Pie with home-made mascarpone cheese ice-cream, an interesting lemony variation and Peach Frangipane Pie with peach sorbet. 

 For pure vegetarians, the peach, bread, butter and yoghurt pudding is strictly eggless, while the sugar-free German Apple Sultana Pie in Phyllo with vanilla beans sauce is great for weight-watchers.

 As always, in every menu, chocolate cannot be missed out and the Chocolate Rum Chiffon Pie with vanilla ice-cream and bitter coffee sauce is sinfully delicious. Each helping is huge and guaranteed to be the perfect end, or even the complete meal.

 ?I wanted the city?s foodies to experience authentic desserts that are truly Continental without any form of Indianisation. The very concept of pies and puddings, which is strong in Europe, has all but disappeared from the city?s food habits with time, and we wanted that authenticity to be replicated through this festival,? said Taj executive chef Surinder Singh.

 The fare is priced between Rs 145 and Rs 165, exclusive of taxes. The same options are also available at La Patisserie for those who prefer to have them packed and taken home.

 Night nourish

 One Day, the coffee shop at Sourav?s: The Food Pavilion, has just started its round-the-clock services.

 ?We will now remain open 24 hours and party people can be sure they don?t have to go home hungry after a long night,? said Kanishka Mazumder, CEO, Sourav?s.

 ?For our loyalists who have loved the spread till now, we have introduced a new menu at the coffee shop,? added general manager Saikat Sarkar.

 Combo-meals priced at Rs 100, along with a range of fast food like pizzas and burgers, have found a place alongside the Indian and Chinese a la carte selection.

 ?Ten different innovative ice-cream concoctions are already proving to be a big hit among guests,? said Saikat.

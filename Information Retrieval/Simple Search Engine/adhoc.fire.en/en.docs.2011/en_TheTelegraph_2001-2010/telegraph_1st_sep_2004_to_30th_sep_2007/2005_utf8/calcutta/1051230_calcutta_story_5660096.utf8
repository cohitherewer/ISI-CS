The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Help-less cops go free

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The superintendent of police of South 24-Parganas, S.N. Gupta, insists that his policemen ?cooperated fully? with Baren Sen after his house was burgled and he was brutally beaten up on Tuesday morning.

 The former fire services director is equally vehement about Gupta?s men having refused him help when he had approached a Purba Jadavpur police patrol.

 Sen, with blood oozing from his head, had approached a jeep from the Purba Jadavpur police station early on Tuesday and narrated how a group of armed burglars had looted his Hossainpur home and battered him and his nephew.

 He says he was ?shooed away? by assistant sub-inspector R.K. Mondal stationed in his jeep on EM Bypass opposite Ruby Hospital. ?Sorry, your house does not fall under the jurisdiction of our police station. Besides, I am here to look after the Bypass (security),? Mondal allegedly said.

 When contacted by Metro, Mondal said: ?I was in the jeep. When they came, I said the Tiljala police would be informed immediately? I assured them that policemen would reach their home by the time they returned. Besides, I was posted on the Bypass. Had I left the place and something happened there, who would have taken the responsibility? You will not understand all this...?

 When asked what should have been given priority ? rushing to Sen?s aid or being on the Bypass ? Mondal banged down the telephone receiver.

 Gupta, of course, has refused to even order a probe into the incident, stating that ASI Mondal and constables Ashok Bhattacharya and Dilip Dutta had done no wrong.

 On Thursday, however, Vageesh Mishra, inspector-general of police, south Bengal, asked him to submit a report. ?I have asked the superintendent to find out exactly what happened and submit a report. If we find any policeman guilty, stern action will be taken against him on charges of dereliction of duty,? said Mishra.

 Police, meanwhile, have arrested a youth and recovered a cell phone and Rs 8,000 looted from Sen?s house.

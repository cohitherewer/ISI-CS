 Horrors of holocaust

 A witness to the persecution of Jews by the Nazis, Artur Brauner devoted the major part of his life to producing films about the victims of the National Socialist Regime. One of the most successful independent film producers in Europe, with over 250 feature films to his credit, Brauner had to face complete rejection early in his career and turn to films for popular entertainment to earn his living. Much later, when the audience had become more receptive to his ideas and ready to accept critical introspection in films, could he return to themes that lay close to his heart. Hosted by Goethe-Institut, the presentation of 10 outstanding feature films produced by him between 1947 and 1990, highlights the horrors of the holocaust and the unending trauma of those who survived it. The inaugural show features Morituri (director: Eugen York), Brauner?s first film, with a heavily autobiographical character. It narrates the experiences of a group of prisoners who escaped from a concentration camp. Reaching a dense forest, the escapees take refuge in a hole in the ground, where they find other fugitives, already hiding there for months. When a young German soldier falls into their hands, they decide against taking their revenge on him, as they are unable to prove his individual guilt. Threatened with starvation, they are finally saved when the German army retreats from their area. Also to be screened this evening, The Plot to Assassinate Hitler (director: Falk Harnach) describes the preparations to eliminate Adolf Hitler by members of the German resistance movement. Set in 1955, it recapitulates through a couple?s remembrance of the dead the events of July 20, 1944, which ended with the execution of the conspirators.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Colours of Calcutta

 Few artists have painted Calcutta with as much intimate emotional attachment as Sanjay Bhattacharyya. Having spent the early part of his life in the city, he grew up intensely observing its various sights and sounds; admiring or lamenting facets about it that directly touched his psyche. The ongoing exhibition of his watercolours, painted with candour and a tender concern, capture the metropolis in its myriad moods and colours, at the same time bearing testimony to his strong bond with the city. Virtually a pictorial encyclopaedia of Calcutta in recent times, the works on show reflect the city?s heterogeneity, with its conflicting contraries in lifestyles and responses to life. In his images of the din of the jostling crowds, the squalor of the ramshackle slums, and the dilapidated stately mansions of Colonial times, one feels the artist?s compassion for a city which is gradually wasting away. His canvases, depicting the Calcutta waterfront, however, paint the city in a more cheerful light, expressing the artist?s own optimism.

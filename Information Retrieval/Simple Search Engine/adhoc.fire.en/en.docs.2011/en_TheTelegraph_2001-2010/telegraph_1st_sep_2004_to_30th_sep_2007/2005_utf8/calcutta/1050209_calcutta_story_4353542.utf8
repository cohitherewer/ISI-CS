The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Kalyan Shah

President, Publishers and Booksellers Guild

A book thief and a common thief should never be seen 

in the same light. In my experience, people who pick up books from the racks at 

the fair are almost always from respectable families. Often, the attempt is an 

outcome of a challenge thrown by friends. Or it might be books that they sorely 

want to possess but cannot pay for. What I do is make them sit in my office till 

well after the fair is over and till our work for the day ends. Then I ask them 

to write an essay on the Book Fair. In most cases, they give up and are close 

to tears after the first few sentences. But sometimes they can. We check whether 

they genuinely need the book and cannot afford it. In such cases, we make a gift 

on behalf of the guild. Handing them over to the police also has its hassles. 

Who will run to the Hare Street police station to lodge a complaint when there 

is a fair to be run?

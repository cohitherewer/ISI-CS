 Reflections in tranquility

 In a sharp contrast from contemporary women painters who generally show a predilection for representing themes highlighting womens issues, the paintings of Pratibha Gadgil reflect a refreshing simplicity of perception and expression that belie her maturity as an artist. A self-taught practitioner of art, the ongoing exhibition of her paintings, done in oil, comprises a collection of both her earliest works as well as her most recent ones. Preferring to portray pleasant emotions through her paintings, her works mainly depict female figures painted in rich, earthy colours. Gadgil displays great skill in wielding the brush, evident in her use of colours, which, though bright and cheerful, enfold her feminine forms in an aura of serenity, peace and contentment. Bearing traces of European influence in style and structure, her art has the power to reach out to the soul, to enchant and captivate the senses. A raw sensuousness also pervades all her characters, who, nevertheless, exude quiet charm and dignified elegance.

 Event: An exhibition of paintings by Pratibha Gadgil

 When: Till June 12; 4 pm - 8 pm

 Where: Birla Academy of Art amp; Culture, 4th floor

 He spent three months on the run, criss-crossing India, travelling with truck drivers. Jason Taylor says he spent the time living the same way the men he was accompanying did. Sleeping and eating in the same places, suffering through stomach upsets, not sleeping for 36 hours at a stretch, and even crying in a hotel room, wondering why he was doing it. 

 All for the sake of his art. The result of the photographer?s ordeal is an exhibition, on at the British Council. The topic is HIV/AIDS awareness, the subjects the many truck drivers he travelled with, and the lives they live. ?Visual anthropology? is how the Londoner describes it. The aim was to break down social stereotypes ? ?they?re nice guys with tough lives?. 

 It was two years ago that Taylor started on his mission. ?I saw these images by an award-winning photographer on AIDS in India, based on sex workers. It was obscene, and didn?t have any bearing on the issue. I had been to India many times before, and this wasn?t the India I knew. So I decided to portray it in a more honest light,? recalls the former carpenter, welder, builder and landscape gardener.

 He liaised with NGOs and the national transport corporation to get access to the truckers, who then had no qualms about letting Taylor ? ?a bald, thin, white bloke with a camera? ? photograph them. The result is a collage of around 350 images, most of them on a disc that is played on a TV screen at the exhibition, throwing light on the lives of the men. His journeys took Taylor from Delhi to Calcutta, Orissa, Hyderabad, Bhopal, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Goa and more.

 The first exhibition he held was in London last September. The one in Calcutta follows another in Delhi around April this year. But he?s been busy with other projects, like one on women?s cooperatives and female empowerment in Brazil, commissioned by Body Shop. His current project is on the girl child and education in India, funded by Unicef. His HIV/AIDS project was mostly self-funded, with some help from Naz Foundation International.

 ?I wanted to open people?s eyes with this exhibition. I had planned to put it up, in a multimedia format, in dhabas around the country. But unfortunately, I haven?t had much success,? Taylor adds.

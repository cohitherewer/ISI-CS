The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 14-month online biz class

 A STAFF REPORTER

 With the e-learning market in India opening up, Jamshedpur-based business school XLRI and telecom major Reliance Infocomm have tied up to launch a postgraduate certificate course in logistics supply chain management, on a virtual classroom platform.

 The programme, ?the first of its kind in Asia?, is targeted at mid-career professionals. The online course will initially be available in Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad and Pune, with plans to gradually take it to other cities.

 ?There are a lot of executives who want to enrol in some of our courses but are unable to visit the campus. This facility is for them,? said Father N. Casimir Raj SJ, director of XLRI.

 The 14-month course, at a cost of around Rs 1.65 lakh, would require students to attend the classes at Reliance WebWorlds, the nationwide chain of Reliance Infocomm retail stores.

 ?We currently conduct around 1,300 hours of training via video conferencing for corporates like HLL, Gillette and Intel and plan to facilitate academic institutions in a similar way,? said Sarup Chowdhury, CEO, Reliance WebWorld.

 The two-way video conferencing facility would let faculty and students see and interact with each other in real-time, though they may be present in different cities. ?There would also be archival facility, allowing those who miss a lecture to revisit them,? Chowdhury informed.

 While Reliance Infocomm is in talks with ?five to six Indian and foreign universities? for similar e-learning projects, XLRI plans to set up a studio on campus for offering online courses in other subjects.

You?ve tried them all ? from precious metals and semi-precious 

stones to junk in various forms. The list of options can go on and on when it 

comes to accessories. But junk, no matter where you pick it from, will exude the 

same appeal. And precious jewellery will not really help you make a very striking 

fashion statement on every occasion. 

Individualism being the keyword in fashion right now, 

being innovative with what you wear seems to be the only way to stand out. While 

it is a little more difficult to flaunt a signature style in your outfits all 

the time (with plagiarism being rampant, even a fully-designer wardrobe can?t 

guarantee you that), the way you accessorise your get up can help you add that 

touch of individuality.

Fashion designer Chhuti shows off an array of wacky 

do-it-yourself accessories that can add colour and funk to any outfit. These versatile 

strings of colourful fabrics can be used as neckpieces, wristwear or even a funky 

headgear, provided you can carry it off.

You can pick them off the racks in her studio Sana 

at 7B Palm Avenue, but do try and string them together yourself. All you need 

is a bagful of leftover cut-pieces of colourful cloth with an eye for aesthetics.

Here, model Sudipta flaunts a host of accessories 

created by Chhuti, along with the designer?s spring-summer 2005 collection.

Jewellery

?After I make an outfit, the leftover pieces of fabric 

are used to do patchwork on different garments. But there are some very tiny pieces 

that can?t be used in any other way. I have used these to make different kinds 

of accessories. These are easy to make, but look striking,? says Chhuti.

Half-inch pieces of square fabric in different colours 

are stringed together with a needle, just like a garland is strung. Then, the 

pieces are twisted to give them a crinkled look.

?Once you have created the basic strings, they can 

be used to make a variety of accessories. These go best with western casuals and 

party wear. One can also pair them with kurtis and pants,? she adds.

A bunch of these long strings can be flaunted on the 

neck for a hippie look. The same can be draped around the wrist to make colourful 

bangles, or round the waist to form an interesting belt. Shorter strings of the 

same material can be used to make earrings, too.

Headgear

While you can just drape a bunch of the brightly-coloured 

strings on your head for an outrageously funky look, Chhuti has actually created 

a cap with these. ?I have twisted layers of these strings round and round in the 

form of a cap around a piece of plain thick cloth,? she explains. A couple of 

strings has been left hanging from one side, while embellishments like mirrors 

have been stitched to it for the gypsy effect. Since all these accessories would 

lend an absolute bohemian feel, there?s no end to the kind of surface ornamentation 

you can use ? right from sequins, mirrors and beads to sea-shells and stones.

Also...

Almost any accessory, including home d?cor items, 

can be created out of these colourful pieces of fabric, says Chhuti, who has also 

designed a bag. This has been done by stitching together the strings on a big 

circular piece of cloth that has been folded into half to make the base of the 

bag. A thick rope serves as the handle. ?Next on my agenda are shoes made of these 

strings,? reveals Chhuti.

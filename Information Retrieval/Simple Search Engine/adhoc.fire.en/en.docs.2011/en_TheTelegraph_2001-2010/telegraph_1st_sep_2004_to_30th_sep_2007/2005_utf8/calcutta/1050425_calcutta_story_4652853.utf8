 Spurned by father, seeks his property 

 TAPAS GHOSH

 1980: A father throws out his newborn girl, along with her mother, just because he wants a boy

 2005:The girl, now married, returns to stake claim to the father?s property

 Ranu Paul, married to a labourer and living in abject poverty, moved the high court on Thursday last week to claim a share of father Rajendranath Biswas?s property in Rajarhat. 

 Biswas, who owns a two-storeyed house, has recently got Rs 10 lakh from his employer, Asansol Aluminium Factory (a state government undertaking), for retiring early.

 This is arguably the first instance of a poor woman filing a petition to establish her right to her father?s property. 

 ?Educated and well-off women have taken such steps before, but it?s quite uncommon for a poor woman like Ranu to approach the court to claim a share,? said advocate Subroto Mookherjee, who has taken up Ranu?s case free.

 ?She was encouraged to do so after attending a legal awareness session conducted jointly by the state government and the Centre,? explained advocate Mookherjee.

 ?Ranu told me that she had witnessed a Lok Adalat organised by the West Bengal Legal Aid Services. The counsellors there advised her to file a case against her father,? he added.

 Several children are disowned by their parents across the state almost daily, simply because they are girls. 

 Besides, there are thousands of abandoned women who are living in extreme poverty, but are unaware of the Properties Act, 1941, which empowers them to stake claim to the property of their fathers or husbands or sons.

 Mookherjee recalled that in 1999, Justice Ramaswamy of the Supreme Court had passed an order, stating that married daughters are entitled to as much share of their father?s property as the sons.

 Ranu is an exception. She informed the court about the ?award? of Rs 10 lakh to her father because of availing of an early retirement scheme and also the fact that he ?owns a two-storeyed building and some other landed property in Rajarhat?.

 She was brought up in an orphanage in Habra, as her mother could only eke out a living by working as a domestic help.

 When she was 10, Ranu had once accompanied her mother to Biswas?s house to seek maintenance allowance. 

 ?But my father and his second wife beat us up and threw us out of the house,? she alleged. ?Ma then went to Rajarhat police station, but no action was taken.?

 Mother Sundari is not keeping well and has been admitted to hospital. Ranu curses her fate for having no money to sustain the treatment.

 Her petition is just the beginning of a process, said advocate Mookherjee. 

 A judge of the high court commented: ?The effort to spread legal education among the poor and the uneducated have borne fruit.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Sound of Satch, sarod and the city

 SUBHRO SAHA

 His grandparents had migrated from Italy way back in 1906 and brought along with them strains of Latino chic to Westbury and Carle Place.

 But for Joe Satriani, weaned on a steady diet of straight-ahead New York rock roll, the focus is clear as a Crystal Planet. He just wants to make magic melodies on his signature JS Ibanez axes, with the trademark Satch punch. 

 And Calcutta, starved of classic riffs through the years even as the epicentre drifted to the neo-nests of Mumbai and Bangalore, cant wait to swing with the sultan of strings to break the drought.

 Satrianis arsenal of his seven custom-made guitars is in town, his dedicated line of amps is being shipped from Mississippi and 50,000 watts of pulsating sound with 120 kw of standard illumination wait to greet fans at the Rabindra Sarobar Stadium, come Sunday sundown.

 But is there love in a space called Calcutta? Or is it just another stop for this whirlwind Joe juggernaut that has rolled over 150,000 miles and taken in 100-plus gigs in more than 25 countries?

 I guess, Calcutta is a touch special, with its rich history and high awareness, and I know I have quite a few fans here who are in sync with the stuff I do, Satriani said on Saturday, ahead of the keenly-awaited Sarobar show.

 The guitar guru, now fully recovered from a bout of pneumonia that briefly stalled his Space tour last winter, is keen to make the most of this Indian summer and carry forward his love affair with the rhythm, harmony and melody of Indian music.

 As a kid, I listened to a lot of Indian classical stuff and it opened up a whole new world. Like most western musicians, Ravi Shankar was my first point of contact too, but honestly, Im more in love with the sarod. Its a beautiful instrument, said the 48-plus Satriani, who lives close to the Ali Akbar music school in California these days.

 And a concord with strings from the East is a distinct possibility. Every culture is constantly evolving and as an artiste, you try and be flexible, absorbing the different elements. India, with its myriad moods, is bound to seep into my upcoming studio project when I start writing over the summer, he said.

 While the next Satriani album is due early next year, he is keen to study Indian music in a more structured manner to explore avenues of collaboration. Having played on stage with Deep Purple and Mick Jagger, he knows how hard these guys worked on their craft behind the scenes, and its much the same with the Indian maestros.

 As a musician, Satriani has always kept himself open to ideas and styles from various schools. So, while Jimmy Hendrix provided the early spark, I have studied bebop, jazz and blues as well. And Miles Davis, John Coltrane and Muddy Waters have been strong influences, just as Jimmy Page.

 Even though he has done a few guitar clinics, Satch prefers teaching on stage for best effects. A guitar academy could be on the cards once he stops touring. But for now, its life on the road for Joe and the gang, confirmed manager Mick Prigden.

 He and Alastair Bramalt-Watson, in charge of illumination, have been grappling with over 30 tonnes of equipment, with four tonnes being hung up in the air. We have special effects with lights, a video projection system and two 48-channel mixing consoles, one on stage and one in the crowd, to add to the extravaganza, said Alastair.

 So get set to sway with Satriani ? Rabindra Sarobar, 6.15 pm, Sunday.

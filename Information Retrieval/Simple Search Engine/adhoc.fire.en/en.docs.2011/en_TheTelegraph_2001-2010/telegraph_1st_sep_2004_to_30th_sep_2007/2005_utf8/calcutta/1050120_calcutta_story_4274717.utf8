 Guilty of burgling grandfather home

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Alipore additional district and sessions court on Wednesday found Sanjukta Basu Roy guilty of committing a dacoity at the residence of her 82-year-old grandfather in Bhowanipore with the help of four professional robbers. 

 Judge Sukhlal Biswas, convinced by the evidence produced by the detective department (DD), decided to convict Sanjukta, also known as Bulbuli, and the four men. 

 The sentence will be pronounced on Thursday.

 According to police, Sanjukta, 21, with the help of four hired goons, had raided the house of Kalyan Ghosh Dastidar on Harish Mukherjee Road on February 23, 2001. ?She had masterminded the robbery,? said an official of DD?s dacoity wing.

 Sleuths investigating the case said Sanjukta had instructed the hired goons to stage an abduction after committing the dacoity. 

 ?Accordingly, after a 20-minute looting spree, the men ?abducted? Sanjukta, before fleeing the house with the booty,? said an official.

 Recounting the sensational robbery masterminded by the young girl, Arun Kumar Dey, the investigating officer, said: ?On the day of the robbery, Sanjukta, the only child of an officer of an insurance company, left her Bansdroni residence and came to her grandfather?s house. Around 3 pm, she knocked on the door of Ghosh Dastidar?s three-storeyed house. She went upstairs and no one noticed anything wrong with her behaviour.?

 After 10 minutes, Sanjukta went down and opened the main door, to let in the four men armed with revolvers and bhojalis. 

 ?The youths, in their late 20s, stormed the first floor. They first tied up the grandfather and his wife and locked them in a room. In another room, the dacoits tied Sanjukta to a showcase,? said the officer. ?The men went to another room on the second floor and tied the hands and legs of her maternal aunt and her son.?

 After taking all the family members hostage, the four youths bundled up the cash and jewellery. Before leaving the house, they freed Sanjukta and ?abducted? her.

 The next day, Sanjukta returned to her Bansdroni residence and told police that she had been taken to Diamond Harbour. ?I, somehow, managed to escape from their clutches,? she said.

 But police had suspected insider involvement from Day I. ?We raided her study and took all her books, papers and diaries to Lalbazar. After a through examination, we came to know of two hotels in Bolpur. A team of officers was sent there,? said Banibrata Basu, then deputy commissioner of police (I), detective department, who supervised the probe.

 ?The sleuths found that Sanjukta had stayed in one of the hotels with Mukhtar Khan on February 17. They had checked into the same hotel on the night of the robbery. They managed to give us the slip and fled a few minutes before our officers raided the hotel,? Basu added.

 During the course of interrogation, Sanjukta confessed to the crime. She told investigators: ?I wanted to live in luxury. I met Mukhtar at a discotheque. We had planned the robbery for quick money.?

 Rachel Weisz: Cop act

 A British beauty playing a tough Los Angeles Police Department cop? Not possible? But that?s precisely who will hit the big screens in town soon.

 Rachel Weisz was not exactly the dazzling glamour girl, nor the damsel in distress, but her roles were more than memorable in Runaway Jury, The Mummy, The Mummy Returns and Enemy at the Gates. 

 But the soft-spoken, dark-haired Hollywood actress likes to stick to the unconventional. She?s back doing exactly that, as cop Angela Dodson in Constantine, the film version of the comic book classic. Starring Keanu ?Neo? Reeves in a strikingly similar black-coat character to his Matrix trilogy, the movie is almost of the film noir genre, but with plenty of action featuring computer-generated demons and beasts from hell. Reeves plays John Constantine, a chain-smoking bad boy helping to save humanity.

 Weisz admits to not being religious nor knowing much about the comic book, but is fascinated by the supernatural and was drawn to the dark nature of this story. She did meet a psychic while filming. 

 Weisz and Reeves have worked together before, in the box-office flop Chain Reaction, eight years ago. This time though, the story and characters are of a different vein. Whether it works or not, you?ll have to wait and watch to find out.

Jeremy Clarkson: In the fast lane

 It?s all about speed, speed and more speed. BBC World?s new series explores our obsession with going faster than the fastest. And who better to anchor the show than the man who has been delving into the world of machines for decades? Jeremy Clarkson, of Top Gear fame, is back in the driver?s seat for Speed, aired Thursdays at 7 pm, with repeats on Sundays and Mondays.

 If you missed the first episode on March 10 ? where the burly Britisher scares himself silly researching the effects of speed on the human body ? then catch Superstars of Speed this week. Clarkson meets the ?speed elite? to find out what it takes to be the fastest. He chats to Formula One world champ Michael Schumacher and drops in at a test pilot school to feel the rush of a free fall through the sky. Buckle up for the adrenaline ride.

Sylvester Stallone: Back in the ring

 All this month it is the turn of the pop-rock band Dragonfly to hog the Spotlight on Channel [V]. After rocking music lovers with the debut album Edge of the World, the band is back with its brand new album, Blind. First assembled in March 2001 by lead singer and songwriter Miki Singh and blues guitarist Peter Parcek, the band dishes out myriad emotions ranging from quiet and moody ballads to anthemic rockers, from engagingly mysterious grooves to dance and funk numbers.

 Blind combines the band?s core rock and pop elements with many South Asian influences, and includes extensive remixes produced by some of the world?s top South Asian dance and remix artistes and producers. Catch the band exclusively on [V] Spotlight special and take a sneak peek into the band?s life, music and journey to stardom.

 If you?re a fan of reality TV, what with the Indian Idols and Super Singers, Fear Factors and Simple Lives taking up screen space and TAM ratings, then here?s an action-packed punch that?s sure to have you hooked. Helping 16 aspiring boxers to become professional prizefighters in The Contender are Sylvester ?Rocky Balboa? Stallone and boxing legend Sugar Ray Leonard. 

 Originally developed for NBC by reality programming guru Mark Burnett (of Survivor and The Apprentice fame), it premiered on AXN in India this month. The contenders are provided with training and hi-tech equipment, but the bout in the ring each week is theirs to win or lose, with their families and friends watching in the audience.

 Now, as the battle hots up among the 16 young men chosen from around the US to win a million dollars, professional fame and fortune, the boxing ring becomes a place where dreams are won and lost. This was tragically illustrated by the suicide of a 23-year-old contestant before the show began. The episode featuring him, however, was not cut out and remains part of the series. 

 If gritty reality and a bit of blood and gore is your thing, then don?t miss this.

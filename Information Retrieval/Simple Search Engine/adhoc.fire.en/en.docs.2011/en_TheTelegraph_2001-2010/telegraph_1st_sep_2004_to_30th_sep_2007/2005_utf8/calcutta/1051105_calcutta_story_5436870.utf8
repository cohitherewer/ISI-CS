 New age tragedy

 Sophocles? King Oedipus had gouged out his eyes on learning that he was his father?s murderer and his mother?s husband. In Stage-Addict?s take-off on this Greek tragedy, the protagonist is a woman undergoing similar and dissimilar experiences and revelations. In the beginning of the play, she is a haughty celebrity. But as her shameful, dirty secrets come out in the open, her pride and arrogance are soon replaced by a desire to seek refuge and hide from those around her. In keeping with the modern setting of the story, the role of the Greek chorus is played by the medi and society. When she begins to piece together the facts of her past in public, she is hounded to destruction by them. On final analysis, the play deals with society?s reaction, or rather, its absolute indifference to those who are not part of the social mainstream. It highlights the problems of lesbians and rape victims, and hushed-up social evils like female infanticide and domestic violence. Script and direction: Adwaita Das. Presented in association with Theatrecian.

 Several corporate houses, Calcutta Police, Corporation and the state administration are trying their best to increase greenery in Calcutta. But, has anybody thought of creating gardens or playgrounds for the children? The answer is ?no?. Of course, there are a few theme parks, but parents can not afford taking their children to these places regularly. The few parks that have been opened in the recent past do not have slings and slides. Instead, they serve as meeting places for lovers. The park in front of the Tata Steel building is an example. It is rather unfortunate that youngsters from respectable families spoil the familial atmosphere of such spots. The authorities should either dedicate parks especially for children or make sure that parents don?t face an embarrassing situation when they take their kids to the new parks in the city.

 Flyovers are a must near Liluah and Dankuni railway stations. Dankuni has been projected as an ideal site for a suburban satellite township, but infrastructural problems like transport will only make the place more congested if the project ever materialises. Many local and express trains pass through Dankuni. Vehicles are forced to wait for 10 to 15 minutes at the railway crossing here for a single train to pass. It takes more than 30 minutes if a few trains come at close intervals. Again, in Liluah, the road leading to the station is very narrow. A flyover here is ?under construction? for the past five years. Authorities need to improve the transport system on a priority basis in the city?s busy suburbs.

 Platform no. 1 of Kolaghat station, under the Howrah-Kharagpur section, is so low that the passengers, especially elderly people, women and children, face quite an uphill task just boarding the train. Often passengers fall and get injured in the process of getting on or off the compartments. A fatal accident may occur any day. Passengers face the same problem at a few other platforms on Calcutta?s fringes as well. I request the railway authorities to raise the height of these platforms at the earliest.

 BSMFC football club of Bandpur, Serampore, established 80 years ago, is well-known for producing some fine footballers in the past. The club owns a building and a football ground in Bandpur, along a canal. Over the years, erosion of the canal bank has eaten up a part of the football ground. The canal needs to be dredged and the bank cemented but the club doesn?t have the resources to take up the work. The local MLA should sanction funds from his MP?s development fund and the sports department should also sanction a grant for the purpose.

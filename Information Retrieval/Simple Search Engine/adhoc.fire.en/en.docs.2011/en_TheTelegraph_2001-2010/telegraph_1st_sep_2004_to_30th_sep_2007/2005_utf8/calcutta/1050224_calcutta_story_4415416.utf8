 A question of answers from society on AIDS

 On February 6, young members of Mayurbhanj Joint Citizen Centre held a session on HIV/AIDS awareness with Muslim religious leaders. There were games and activities, at the end of which was a question-answer session.

 One of the madarsa teachers was alarmed that the posters put up by the students mentioned the use of condoms. He felt that if one followed Islam, which says that one should ?not do ?Jena? or go into a sexual relationship with anybody other than his wife?, and had the ?fear of Allah? in him, there was no question of the use of condom. This was like asking somebody to steal but to steal safely.

 The team member conducting the session answered: ?We all know that a person accused of rape can be sentenced to death or life imprisonment, but does this stop people from committing the crime? We know it is not right to steal, but do we actually follow it? Yes, if one could follow the teachings of Islam, there is no question of HIV transmission.? 

 One Imam said that society had degenerated and AIDS was God?s punishment to society. There were more emotional outbursts from the audience, as the youth group struggled to get across its point. On Friday, February 11, one of the Imams spoke on the issue of HIV/AIDS for the first time publicly.

 The Mayurbhanj Joint Citizen Centre group is one of the 34 participating in the Youth Awards for Social Initiatives project, jointly organised by Thoughtshop Foundation, the state AIDS Prevention and Control Society and Balmer Lawrie and Company Ltd. Started in September 2004, the three-phased project ? training, planning and implementation ? is now approaching its end, on March 15.

 ?It?s been going very well, with lots of projects done. Most of them have more activities up their sleeve,? says Revathi Rajaram, project coordinator, Thoughtshop.

 The teams are now in the final round of activities, taking the message of awareness to society with the monitoring team following their progress. On Valentine?s Day, the Ramnarayanpur Kalika Sangha team performed a play in Kashipur. Vidyasagar School of Social Work (VSSW) students spread the word through games, quizzes and posters. There is also a team from NCC 55 Bengal BN (Tamluk) ?six boys and four girls.

 Aastha, another bunch of youngsters from VSSW, sang songs and had a question-answer session at the Nandan gardens, on World AIDS Day (December 1), even asking young couples questions. The Saviours, a group from Jadavpur University (JU), performed street plays, conducted quizzes and distributed condoms on the roads. Some drivers and teenagers accepted the condoms, but a few women refused, saying they had faithful husbands. 

 ?It has been a wonderful learning experience,? says Priyadarshini Roy from AID for AIDS, another team from JU. ?We have been speaking to a range of people, from students to rickshaw-wallahs. The response has been quite good. Some elderly people were embarrassed by us young people talking about the issue.?

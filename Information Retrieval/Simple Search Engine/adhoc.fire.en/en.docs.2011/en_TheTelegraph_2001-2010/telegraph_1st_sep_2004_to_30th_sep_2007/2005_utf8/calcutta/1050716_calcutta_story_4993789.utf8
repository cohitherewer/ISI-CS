 Symphony of seasons

 In Tagores songs composed in praise of the seasons, his vivid poetical imagery makes nature come alive with an almost human sensitivity. A dance presentation celebrating the seasonal cycle, Sapphires Rituranga captures the spirit and soul of each season through a selection of Tagores compositions. Designed in the form of a modern dance ballet where Tagore?s creations meet Western symphonic styles, this experimental performance is a breathtaking tribute to nature?s eternal gift to mankind. It uses the rhetoric and technique of contemporary dance to explore the richness, flavour and splendour of the six seasons, grishma, varsha, sharat, hemanta, sheeta and vasanta. With innovative choreography by Sudarshan Chakraborty, the performance visualises the changing face of nature through dynamic language fused with a unique musical idiom. Performed by students of Sapphire Creations Dance Workshop. Hosted by Reliance IndiaMobile and Spandan, in association with Tollygunge Club.

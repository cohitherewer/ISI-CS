Life

 Of smile and style

 Maureen Wadia, director of Gladrags Mrs India, might have given a big thumbs down to married women of the region when she was in the city scouting for finalists for the pageant last month, but theres at least one aspirant who has managed to catch the ace model makers eye.

 Swati, a homemaker from Assam, is the only chosen contestant from the eastern region who will vie for the Gladrags Mrs India 2006 crown at the finals in Mumbai on December 10.

 GoodLife gets up close with the lady before she leaves for Mumbai on November 10 for a one-month grooming session.

 Age: 29 years

 Background: Born in Bihar to middle-class parents, Swati shifted to a tea garden in Assam after she got married 10 years ago

 Family: Lives with husband Manjul Vijoy, who works in a tea garden, and their seven-year-old son

 Education: After passing her plus-two, she did a diploma in Montessori education from Modern Montessori International in Gurgaon

 Pursuits: A sports freak, Swati plays football and tennis regularly. She is also passionate about painting

 Applying for Mrs India: She saw the advertisement inviting applications for the pageant on TV and decided to give it a shot. Winning a small beauty pageant in college apart, Swati has never had a brush with modelling or the glamour world. I decided to participate for the experience and my husband was very supportive.

 Final countdown: The one-month grooming session organised by Gladrags will take care of almost all the preparations. So, the only area that needs some attention is the wardrobe. Swati has chosen designer and style consultant Sunipa Samadder to do up the entire wardrobe for her. Sunipa is designing a rani pink hipster lehnga with a bustier, a black gown, a black embroidered cocktail dress, a few skirts, corsets, spaghettis and halters for the lady with no stars in her eyes. Swati has a great figure and she is fairly flexible with clothes, says Sunipa.

 Target talk: I am really not thinking of winning right now. Its the experience I am looking forward to. For me its a whole new experience and Im sure itll make me a new person.

 Watch out for: Her height at 5 ft 8 inches, her size-10 figure, her smile and, of course, those dimples

 Mystery death as teen falls off roof

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 A 16-year-old boy died mysteriously on Monday night, falling off the fourth-floor terrace of the fire services department headquarters on Mirza Ghalib Street.

 Udipto Adhikary, a resident of the building and son of senior divisional fire services officer Uday Adhikary, had gone up to the fourth-floor terrace from their second-floor flat around 9.45 pm.

 Ten minutes later, guards outside the building heard a thud and rushed out to see Udipto?s body lying on the concrete pavement. The boy died before he could be rushed to SSKM Hospital.

 ?Udipto was bursting crackers by himself on the terrace. He probably got distracted, lost his balance and fell,? said H.C. Das, officer-in-charge of New Market police station.

 Some residents of the building, however, refuted the police version. 

 ?There is no chance of anyone losing his balance and falling from the terrace, which has a four-ft guard wall. He would have to climb the smaller terrace above,? said Deepak Sarkar, a senior officer residing on the floor just above the Adhikarys.

 Neighbours described Udipto as tall and good-looking. They said he was not interested in bursting crackers.

 Udipto?s body bore no marks of external injury and preliminary post-mortem reports revealed that he died after his second cervical vertebrae ? near the neck ? snapped with the impact of the fall from around 75 ft. 

 With the boy dying almost immediately, blood remained trapped in his kidneys and liver.

 According to Dr Debasish Sarkar, who performed the post-mortem, the teenager had just a few graze marks on the back, which may have been caused by gravel or a small concrete projection he had brushed past.

 This would not have been the case if Udipto had hit the parapets of the building while falling, the doctor observed.

 Residents said after his father returned from a show at Nandan around 9.45 pm on Monday, Udipto had told him that he wanted a breather. 

 His mother Dipti ? a patient of chronic depression ? was lying in the other room. Udipto then took the wrought-iron steps leading to the terrace from their kitchen.

 Minutes later, he was dead.

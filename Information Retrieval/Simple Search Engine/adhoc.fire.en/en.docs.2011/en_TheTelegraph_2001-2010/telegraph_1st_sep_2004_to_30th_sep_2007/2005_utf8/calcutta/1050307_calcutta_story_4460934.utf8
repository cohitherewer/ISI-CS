 Architecture brain drain in focus

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Senior architects and academicians in the city have expressed concern over the ?brain drain? of students from the stream of architecture into other ?more lucrative sectors like IT?, and also to other states for higher education.

 ?We have been losing a clutch of bright students to institutes like SPA (School of Planning and Architecture), Delhi, or CEPT (Centre for Environmental Planning and Technology), Ahmedabad, for lack of higher-studies options here,? says city-based teaching-architect Mukul Mitra.

 Mitra, convener of the Indian Institute of Architects? 21st national convention held in Calcutta last December, laments that while the number of recognised colleges in the country teaching architecture has gone up from 14 in 1969 to 114 now, West Bengal still languishes at three.

 ?True, many of our good students move on to places like SPA, which offer them greater exposure and hence, more career options. But one must bear in mind that all professional courses have teething troubles and students will face start-up blues,? observes Manju Halder, department head of architecture, Bengal Engineering amp; Science University, Shibpur.

 It?s this initial period of roughing it out before they can settle down into a steady practice that deters many youngsters. ?Some of them are in a dilemma, because they need an income, and the IT sector often beckons with lucrative start-up pay-packets,? says Suchandra Bardhan, professor in Jadavpur University (JU)?s architecture department and an expert in landscape architecture.

 For those staying on course, the trend is more towards going for higher studies or freelancing. ?More than 50 per cent of our students try to do things on their own these days, as opposed to working as understudy to a senior architect, where often the remuneration is grossly inadequate,? says Halder. Her university offers 24 architecture seats to JU?s 30.

 Arvind Krishan, head, department of architecture, SPA, confirms he gets many students from Calcutta. ?Some of our students have done theses on Calcutta?s waterfront, quot; he says.

 IIA?s West Bengal chapter realises the state doesn?t have the teaching infrastructure to provide critical inputs to advanced students. ?We are toying with the idea of setting up a dedicated autonomous school of architecture and planning in Bengal to address the exodus,? says architect Dulal Mukherjee, chapter chairman.

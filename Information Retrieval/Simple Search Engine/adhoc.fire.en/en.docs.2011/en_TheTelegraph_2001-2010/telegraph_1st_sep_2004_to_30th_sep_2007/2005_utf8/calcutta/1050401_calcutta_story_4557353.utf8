The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Small talk

For some, the holiday started on Wednesday and the 

party continues. As you get ready for the legitimate weekend though, you ought 

to load up on a little more than the tumultuous weather to see you through those 

balmy evenings? 

Trade off

If you?d stocked up on the party essentials beforehand, 

good for you, or else just blame the frugal fare on the traders? strike to protest 

the VAT. Make up for the lack of cold cuts by blowing hot on the new tax regimen 

that?s got the entire nation up in arms, and most of us more than a little confused. 

So, start at the very beginning: decode the mystery letter by letter (value added 

tax) and then get to the heart of the matter. Seem wise when you warn them to 

check all bills and invoices henceforth, which ought to mention the VAT amount 

separately, so as not to be taken for a ride.

Weather report

Save your cribs about the sultry weather for later. 

Pen a paean on the lyrical rain to impress the gathering instead, which is offsetting 

the heat and the humidity at regular intervals. Practice a kalbaisakhi 

number or two to floor them further. Lack of inspiration wouldn?t be a good enough 

excuse considering it?s been almost a week since the rain-and-thundershower dance 

started. The prosaic types can practice a more no-nonsense weather report that 

should begin with the pre-monsoon showers (?They are caused by a low pressure 

trough in the neighbouring states, which gradually took the shape of the expected 

nor-westers... Blah, blah... snore.) 

Sweet poison

Spice up the evening with some sweet poison by discussing 

Udita Goswami?s bare back sequences in Mohit Suri?s Zeher. Like other model-turned 

actresses (yes, another one) before her, Udita plays a steamy siren, this time 

the ?other woman?. Divert your attention long enough to dwell on the azure seas 

of Goa, where the film is shot. Girls can?t help but drool over the dashing Emraan 

Hashmi, who plays the hapless protagonist caught in the eye of a storm. Potent 

combination for more steam (it?s all thanda in the second half), but the 

film might not have too much more to offer...

Fool?s day

If you don?t have a stomach for conversation on Friday, 

just play the fool. For once, polite eyebrows won?t rise in nasty arches because 

it?s the first of April! If you want to pull a fast one on them, invite each unsuspecting 

guest to a party with a different theme. Laugh your guts out at their foolishness 

for having taken you at face value on this day of the year, or act the part of 

indignant host and accuse them of spoiling the party cheer. Once they?ve downed 

a couple of drinks, they?ll forgive and forget and be ready for another round 

of confusion. But when you are so badly outnumbered, make sure your guests aren?t 

actually the wiser, in which case, the tables will turn and cause some serious 

ego injuries, at the very least.

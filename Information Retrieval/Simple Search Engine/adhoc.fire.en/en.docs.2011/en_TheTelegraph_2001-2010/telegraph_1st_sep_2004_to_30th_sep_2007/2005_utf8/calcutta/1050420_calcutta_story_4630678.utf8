 Tax loophole robs civic coffers 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Systematic ?under-assessment of property? by the civic inspectors and interference by councillors in the colony areas of New Alipore, Tiljala, Kasba, Tollygunge, Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur are costing the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) Rs 200 crore a year in taxes.

 About 400,000 buildings and apartments in the colony areas have remained outside the purview of civic tax due to resistance by councillors, cutting across party lines.

 This has been revealed in a recent survey, conducted by the civic revenue department, to identify new revenue sources.

 ?Colonies now exist only in signboards. Multi-storeyed buildings have come up illegally in almost all the colonies. The plots were sold at lucrative prices, but a section of councillors are still opposed to collection of property tax from the flat-owners at the current rate,? mayor Subrata Mukherjee said. 

 According to officer on special duty to the mayor Shaktibrata Ghosh, the government had distributed free pattas for 50,000 plots, each measuring three cottahs, among the residents of colonies. About 500,000 flats have come up on the plots. Since almost all the constructions are illegal, they are described as single-storey huts or buildings in the CMC records. 

 ?I am ready to offer tax relief to the owner of a hut on a colony plot, but how can someone expect a tax rebate after purchasing a flat on a colony plot by shelling out Rs 10 lakh?? asked Mukherjee. 

 The mayor held the ?inspector raj? responsible for the under-assessment of buildings. According to him, over the past 20 years, the inspectors have under-valued houses in exchange of bribes.

 The total assessed value of about 350,000 buildings for the collection of property tax has been pegged at Rs 305 crore only. ?The lower the value of a house, the lesser the amount of tax the owner has to pay. Hence, house-owners grease the palms of the assessment inspectors for under-valuation of their property,? mayor Mukherjee said.

 The CMC Act of 1980 provides undue discretionary powers to assessment inspectors engaged in deciding the notional value of a building. ?I am not sure that the Act was not drafted by dishonest assessment inspectors,? the mayor exclaimed.

 As per the assessment records, there are only 800 ?high-value? houses in the city, with notional annual worth over Rs 5 lakh at the current market rate. Jeevan Deep, on Chowringhee, has been valued the highest at Rs 4.36 crore.

 Officer on special duty Ghosh said that it is difficult to prove the guilt of the inspectors without physically assessing the value of each house.

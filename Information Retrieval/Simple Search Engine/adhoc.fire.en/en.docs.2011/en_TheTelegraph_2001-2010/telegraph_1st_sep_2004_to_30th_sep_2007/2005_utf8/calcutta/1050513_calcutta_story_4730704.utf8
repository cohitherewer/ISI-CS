 Of tradition and the trend

 A satirical comedy that takes a dig at followers of Western culture and lifestyle, Tagores Shodhbodh is a play that instructs and entertains, while having true contemporary relevance. Being staged as part of Tagores birth anniversary celebrations, Anya Theatre?s production makes an attempt to understand the cause of the malaise affecting members of the educated, urban, upper-middle class, and the unfortunate repercussions it has on other sections of society. In the play, Satish, the son of traditional Bengali parents, falls in love with Nalini, the daughter of affluent parents, who swear by Western ideals and follow an European way of life. In his passionate zeal to impress Nalini and engage her attentions, Satish also adopts a Western lifestyle. In doing so, he indulges in cheating, lying, deception and other vices, throwing caution to the winds. When Satish is on the brink of disaster, Nalini, who had initially rejected his romantic advances, rescues him from trouble and finally marries him. Direction: Bibhas Chakraborty.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cradle for call centre cadre

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The figures may not match up to Delhi or Bangalore, but the call-centre industry in Calcutta looks set for a boom.

 To cater to the growing demand for trained call-centre personnel, city-based IT company Descon Limited and US-based Telesynergy is launching a training academy called Descon Training Solutions.

 ?We plan to provide training to around 200 to 300 people per month,? said S. Radhakrishnan, managing director, Descon Limited.

 The 2,600-sq-ft training centre on Sarat Bose Road will offer courses in basic training, contact centre skills and spoken English. They would range from four to 12 weeks and cost Rs 3,000 to Rs 7,500.

 Descon has a call centre in Salt Lake with 100 seats, operational since March this year, and plans to ramp up the capacity to 200 seats by March 2006 and 500 seats by the end of next year.

 ?We will provide placement to our students through our own call centre, as well as other centres we are tying up with, and through campus interviews,? said Rakhi Mukherjee, manager of Descon Training Solutions.

 The centre is targeting freshers, as well as candidates already working on the floor. 

 ?We are looking at 10+2 students and those in the final year of their graduation. We?ve also seen a response from people in areas like sales and marketing, who would like to enter the call centre field,? Mukherjee added.

 The institute would like to lay ?special emphasis on one-to-one coaching? and is looking at a batch size of ?around 20 students?.

 According to Descon, the city presently has about 1,500 people employed in the call centre industry. The company expects the figure to reach ?5,000-7,000? by the year-end.

 Public Soft Corporation, the service delivery division of Telesynergy, is providing the training modules for Descon Training Solutions. 

 ?The course content is based on guidelines laid down by the US-based Call Centre Networking Group. Besides Descon, four other call centres operational in Calcutta are using our technology,? offered Inder Bhat of Telesynergy.

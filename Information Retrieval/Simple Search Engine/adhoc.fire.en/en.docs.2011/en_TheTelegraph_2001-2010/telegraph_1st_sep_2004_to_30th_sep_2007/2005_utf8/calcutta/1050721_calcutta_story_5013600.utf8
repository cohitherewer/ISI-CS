 The ground beneath your feet is often neglected in home d?cor since what hits the eye the least also matters the least. Flooring, however, is a vital part of any interior and its essential that it blends with the d?cor and enhances it.

 The flooring should be in sync with the furniture and theme of a room. When deciding on the flooring, one must take care to choose colours and patterns that complement the furniture, wall coverings and window treatments, says interior designer Manjari Sahay.

 Goodlife checks out some of the options available.

Tile talk

 Vitrified tiles are extremely popular nowadays, what with the variety of colours, shapes and sizes on offer, says Sahay.

 Ceramic tiles, she explains, bring texture, richness and colour to a room and are definitely more stylish than the linoleum ones.

 oor tiles are basically of two types ? glazed and porcelain, the latter being more expensive.

 Earlier, floor tiles were used only in kitchens and bathrooms. But with more and more fashionable options on offer, these are widely used in living rooms and often bedrooms, too, she adds. 

 oor tiles score over other options on easy maintenance. These are also easy to fit, since theres no need to demolish the previous flooring. One can get approximately 2,000-sq-ft of tiling done in a single day.

Stone story

 Granite and stones are other interesting floor options that can be used creatively for stylish effect. Olive green, yellow Jaisalmer stone and slate are the preferred colours. Stones can also be combined to create different designs by merging various colours, says interior designer Gopa Ray.

 The advantage of stone flooring, especially in India, is the cooling effect it has on the whole room.

 The other always-popular flooring stone is marble, which if laid carefully and cleaned regularly can last a lifetime. 

 Marble can be classified into many different types, depending on the place it hails from. Some better known ones are Italian, Iranian and Indian. These, too, come in a variety of colours.

Wood ways

 Wooden flooring has made a comeback with a classy chic tag to it. The retro, vintage look is a hit in home d?cor now and hence wooden flooring has suddenly become very popular, feels Sahay.

 While the look it lends is antique, there are some modern and easy ways of getting wooden flooring done. Parquet or ready-to-install wooden flooring is a good bet here.

 Pre-laminated wooden flooring is another option, where the wood is naturally very thin and has a sheen of its own.

 The only minus point of wood is that it tends to heat up the room quite a bit during summer. However, during winter it helps in just the same way, points out Ray.

 If the heat problem bothers you too much, wood-finish tile is the easy way out. It looks and even feels like real wood. 

Carpet call

 Carpets have an appeal thats hard to resist. Carpets add life to the floor in the same way paintings do to a wall. Though known to collect dust and be high on maintenance, carpets have a charm of their own, says Ray.

 l-time favourites are the Oriental and Persian varieties. Natural rugs combine fashion and durability. Some, like Sisal rugs, constructed from a rope-like tough fibre, is a good choice if durability is the key concern. 

 Tibetan rugs, handwoven from wool and silk, in designs ranging from geometric and abstract patterns to traditional Buddhist symbols are more delicate and in need of constant care.

 One way to ensure you never get bored with your flooring is to choose a neutral tile or hardwood floor and keep changing the rugs from time to time.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 For joy, days and nights in the forest

 TAMAL SENGUPTA

 The state forest department is conducting special tour packages to six destinations exclusively for Calcuttans this winter, on two counts. 

 First, to earn more revenue, and second, to make people more environment-friendly. 

 This is being done after Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee showed interest in starting conducted tours by forest officers, as in other states. 

 Forest minister Jogesh Barman said over the telephone from north Bengal that he did not take any help from the tourism department. ?Our venture will help the state transport corporations earn revenue, as we are hiring their vehicles to conduct our tours,? he added.

 ?We can induce those touring the jungles to buy saplings of precious trees. This will help us earn revenue,? pointed out Somnath Mukherjee, deputy conservator of forests, social and recreational forestry, on Sunday. 

 Most of the destinations where the tourists are being taken for picnics and being brought back the same evening, are forests. 

 The picnic spots include Gandhi Ghat in Barrackpore, where the department has a large garden and a number of resorts along the Hooghly. 

 In Kalyani, the tours are being conducted at Picnic Gardens, where the department has a large bungalow on a sprawling garden and forest. The buses leave from Eden Gardens. 

 ?We are also taking tourists to our garden and forest on Chandrakona Road, in Midnapore, and Geokhali, in Howrah, where we have a forest along the Roopnarayan river. We will not mind taking people to our sanctuary in Bethuadahari, in Nadia district, from Calcutta and back to the city the same night,? Mukherjee said.

 Small vehicles like Tata Sumos are being provided to small groups of tourists willing to go to any of the six destinations, he added. 

 Fifty trips have already been organised to different destinations on December 31 and January 1 and 2. 

 On New Year?s Day alone, 6,000 people were taken to different destinations. 

 ?We are taking people for tours on January 8, 9, 15,16, 22, 23, 26, 29 and 30. Plans are ready to continue our tours till the middle of February,? said a senior forest department officer. Already 10,000 Calcuttans have made these trips.

 The department will provide accommodation for those who are willing to visit Chandrakona Road and want to stay the overnight, as it can be difficult to return to Calcutta the same day.

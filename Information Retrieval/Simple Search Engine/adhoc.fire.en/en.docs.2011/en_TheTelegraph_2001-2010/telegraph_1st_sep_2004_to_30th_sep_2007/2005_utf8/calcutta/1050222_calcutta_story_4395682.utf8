 All worked up over CU workshop

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 A long-standing conflict between the Calcutta University (CU) authorities and the SFI-controlled students? union over modernisation of a physics workshop has put the university on the boil. The workshop was used by the likes of CV Raman, Meghnad Saha and SN Bose.

 The students? union has demanded removal of the equipment in the workshop so that it can be converted into a placement cell with a conference hall for holding campus interviews. Last week, the union members threatened to ?fast unto death? if their demand was not met.

 The authorities, on the other hand, have finalised plans to modernise the workshop and set up a museum in memory of the great scientists who had worked there.

 University officials said a proposal on how to develop the workshop was sent to the Union human resources development department, which gave an initial clearance and sanctioned a grant of over Rs 20 crore.

 ?Despite the Centre?s green light, we are compelled to go slow on the project because of pressure by the students? union,? complained a senior CU official.

 The students are determined to stick to their stand. 

 ?We had placed a demand for setting up the placement cell at the site of the workshop more than a year ago. We will not allow the authorities to undertake any project for modernising the workshop,? Subhas Mondal, general secretary of the students? union, said.

 According to the students, there is plenty of space on the premises to preserve the equipment used by the great scientists, while the workshop, spread over 2,000 sq ft, is the ?best? site for setting up a placement cell.

 The students? union members claimed the existing conference halls on the campus are not suitable for big companies to hold group discussions and interactive sessions during campus interviews. 

 ?We are aware of the students? demand. At the same time, we cannot cancel plans to modernise the workshop,? said Suranjan Das, pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs) and chairman of the university?s space committee. 

 ?The scientists who have worked there are not just the pride of our university, but of the entire nation,? he added.

 Union secretary Mondal, however, said: ?The workshop in question has become completely obsolete. The equipment there are of no use and if they are to be preserved for their historical value, they can be shifted to a different site on the premises.?

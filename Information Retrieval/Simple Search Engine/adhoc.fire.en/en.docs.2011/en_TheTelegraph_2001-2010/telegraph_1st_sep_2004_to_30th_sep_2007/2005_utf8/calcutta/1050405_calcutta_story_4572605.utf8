 It?s billed to be the Oscars of Indian fashion. While not going into the lane to LA, the Kingfisher Fashion Awards has managed to make quite a mark in the country?s style industry since 2000. The fifth edition of the high-profile event, held at the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower in Mumbai on April 2, was much more than an awards ceremony. A heady mix of gorgeous designs, ravishing models and mood music, garnished with a dash of stardust, made the event a memorable one.

 Professionals from every sphere related to fashion ? be it designing, modelling, styling, photography and reporting ? found a place on the list of awardees. ?The Kingfisher Fashion Awards play a significant role in encouraging and promoting the best in the Indian fashion industry. It is not only designers and models we honour, but also the creative foundations on which this industry is built,? said Dr Vijay Mallya, chairman of the UB Group. and the man behind the awards.

 The star-studded show, compered by Bollywood bombshell Isha Koppikar and model-turned-actor Rahul Dev, started off with a fashion extravaganza presented by Kingfisher?s in-house designer Manoviraj Khosla. The new line of Kingfisher pret, unveiled by Khosla, was dominated by lots of colours, retro twists, layers and layers of fabric, rubberised prints and boots of varying heights.

 The next sequence on the ramp was truly unique ? as much for the clothes as for the models flaunting them. Members of the cabin crew of the soon-to-be-launched Kingfisher Airlines walked the ramp in their designer line of uniforms created by Khosla. Red knee-length skirts paired with white shirts and red waistcoats teamed with bright red shoes shouted out the theme colours for the airlines.

 ?Red is not only a hot colour, it has instant association with Kingfisher and that?s what the uniform of the cabin crew of any airline should attempt to do. Even the handbags and strolleys used by the cabin crew will be red,? revealed the designer.

 The action on the ramp hotted up with Kingfisher Designer of the Year Rajesh Pratap Singh unveiling his line of sparkling white fusion wear. The cool and summery line comprised flowing skirt, kurta, dhoti and churidar in white base with bright floral embellishments.

 The next designer to take the action forward was Narendra Kumar, who was awarded for his contribution to the fashion industry, along with Neeta Lulla. Kumar?s line of ?sports couture? for men and women took a fresh new look at sporting wear as softer fabrics made an attempt to ?move away from machismo?.

 The best was truly saved for last, as Neeta Lulla enthralled the audience with a grand finale and dusky beauty Sameera Reddy, no less, joined the models on the catwalk. An opulent collection of lehngas in copper and gold inspired by the carvings of Khajuraho created an ethereal aura. Sheer fabrics and colours of the carvings, combined with circular gold embellishments and intricate embroidery, presented a sensual yet ornate look.

 The country?s top models including Sheetal Malhar, Vidisha Pavate, Jesse Randhawa, Nethra Raghuraman, Fleur Xavier, Noyonika Chatterjee Singh, Tupur Chatterjee, Aryan Vaid, Upen Patel, Zulfi Syed and Shahwar Ali among others showcased the designs on the ramp.

 The awards ceremony punctuated the fashion show at regular intervals as Mallya handed over the trophies and fat cheques to the winners. Apart from the three style bigwigs who showcased their creations on Saturday, designer Shahab Durazi was honoured with a lifetime achievement award. Four winners from the modelling fraternity were awarded ? Deepika Padukone and Rajneesh Duggal as female and male models of the year, and Rachael Bayros and Mustafa Hussain as the new models of the year.

 In recognition of professionals behind the limelight, the awards also honoured make-up artistes Cory Walia and Mickey Contractor. Photographer of the year and fashion writer of the year awards were bagged by Bharat Sikka and Suparna Motwane respectively. 

 The show over, it was time for the crowd to hit the sprawling nightclub of the hotel, where the party continued till Sunday morning.

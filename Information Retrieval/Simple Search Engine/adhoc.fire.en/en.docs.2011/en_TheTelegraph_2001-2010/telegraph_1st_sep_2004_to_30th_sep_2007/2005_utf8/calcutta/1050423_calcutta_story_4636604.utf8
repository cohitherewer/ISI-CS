The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Regular commuters on Esplanade-bound buses passing through Rajabazar and Moulali crossings suffer the brunt of severe traffic snarls on the stretch during office hours every day. Most private buses stop for too long near Sealdah station (at both ends of Vidyapati Setu) to pick up the maximum possible number of passengers. In the process, they block the road and create unending traffic jams. The few cops who are there are silent spectators to the peak-hour chaos on the roads. The authorities must make sure that buses do not stop for too long on this stretch, at least during rush hours.

 A garbage vat has been installed by Calcutta Municipal Corporation right on the main thoroughfare in ward 85, opposite 97, Monoharpukur Road. It is an open vat and is a serious health hazard for residents of the locality. All democratic means of protest, including giving mass representation, to the authorities concerned have failed. Are Pollution Control Board regulations not applicable on the Corporation?

 On Calcutta University?s College Street campus, several public telephones are installed where a call can be made just for Re 1. But most of the time they do not work. Some machines are flooded with Re 1 coins. Authorities are least bothered even to take the money out. Hence,we, the students, never benefit from the phones.

 Labourers repairing roads in ward 12 of Budge Budge Municipality are burning rejected tyres as fuel to heat the asphalt mixture. This emanates a dense, foul-smelling smoke which is very injurious to passers-by as well as for the labourers engaged in the work. I request the state pollution control board to stop the practice to reduce air pollution and also for the safety of the residents.

 Name and address withheld on request. 

 Apropos a letter on laughter club published in this column on April 9, the remark that residents in the vicinity of Deshabandhu Park are awakened by the sound of laughter is not at all justified. The exercise starts at 6.15 am in summer and 6.30 am in winter and is over in 15 minutes. Moreover, the place where the exercise is done is such that the sound of laughter cannot travel that far. We felt it necessary to educate the letter-writer from central Calcutta who hears the laughter all the way from north Calcutta.

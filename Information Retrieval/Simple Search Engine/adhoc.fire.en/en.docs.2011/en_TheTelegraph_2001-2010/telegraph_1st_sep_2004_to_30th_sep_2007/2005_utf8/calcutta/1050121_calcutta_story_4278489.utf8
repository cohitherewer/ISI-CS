The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Raju told to give in

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court on Thursday granted conditional interim anticipatory bail to Reverend P.S.P. Raju, Bishop of Calcutta and Churches of North India (CNI) and chairman, board of governing body of St Thomas School, Kidderpore.

 While granting his prayer, the division bench of Justice N.A. Chowdhury and Justice A.K. Bhattacharya asked the bishop to surrender before the chief metropolitan magistrate (CMM) within a fortnight.

 This is the first time the high court has asked a bishop to surrender before a trial court and seek bail from it. If the bishop does not carry out the order, the interim anticipatory bail order will automatically stand invalid. 

 The bishop had prayed for anticipatory bail, apprehending arrest after criminal proceedings were drawn against him in the CMM?s court on the basis of a complaint lodged by Goutam Banerjee, registrar of St Thomas Engineering College, in the Shakespeare Sarani police station area.

 The registrar alleged that in 2000, the bishop, as chairman of the governing body of St Thomas School, had made an agreement that a part of the school land would be handed over to the engineering college. According to the agreement, the school governing body was supposed to hand over the land in 2004. 

 The complainant said accordingly, a full-fledged engineering college was started on the plot. A good number of students was enrolled.

 The complainant alleged that after four years, the bishop declined to hand over the plot to the college authorities. Later, it was found out that according to the St Thomas Act, the bishop had no authority to sign the agreement. 

 In an earlier order, the division bench of the high court had directed the bishop to meet the investigating officer of the case at regular intervals and to cooperate with him.

 Appearing on behalf of Banerjee, counsel Asim Roy told the court that because of the bishop, the college authorities were in a predicament. 

 ?The college has already started functioning, but the fate of a number of students studying in the institution is in the dark,? said the lawyer.

 A large number of people, most of them from the Christian community, thronged the court to hear the case. Sardar Amjad Ali appeared on behalf of the bishop.

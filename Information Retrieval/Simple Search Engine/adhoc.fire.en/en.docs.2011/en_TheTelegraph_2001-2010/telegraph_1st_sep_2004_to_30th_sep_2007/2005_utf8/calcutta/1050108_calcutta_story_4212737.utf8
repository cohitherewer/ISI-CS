He has been around for nine long years, lending his 

vocal chords to numerous concerts the world over. From 31st Nite shows back home 

in Calcutta to musical performances in Japan, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Bangladesh, 

Thailand, Hong Kong, Singapore, Italy, Spain, Ghana, UAE, Belgium, South Africa, 

the UK and US, city boy Sandeep Vyas has done it all. 

After carving out a market for himself in India as 

well as the NRI community, the singer is all set to launch his debut album.

To be released by HMV Saregama, Deewanapan 

is a compilation of five remixes and two original songs. The album will be accompanied 

by music videos, too (a sequence above). 

?The past year has been very important for me. I took 

a big step by deciding to move to Mumbai after completing my demo in Calcutta. 

The move paid off and my album and first video will be released this month. The 

second video will follow soon,? says Sandeep.

About the album, he says: ?Deewanapan is a 

peppy album with a romantic feel. It leaves the listener on a happy note.? 

The remixes are of hits such as Jadoo teri nazar 

(which is the first video), Sanam teri kasam, Gora rang, Hum 

tum ek kamre mein bandh ho and Om shanti om. 

Jadoo teri nazar is a hip-hop mix, while Sanam 

teri kasam and Hum tum? are club mixes, Om shanti om has a Salsa 

feel and Gora rang has a Bhangra beat. ?My brother DJ Sanjeev has mixed 

the remixed tracks while I have sung them,? he explains.

The two original tracks written by Sandeep are Deewanapan 

(the second video) and Jab se dekha. 

?The two original tracks are very close to my heart. 

Jab se dekha is a salsa mix and Deewanapan, my favourite, is a romantic 

pop track. During a 31st Nite show in Calcutta I gave the crowd a taste of my 

album with Deewanapan and the response was overwhelming,? recalls Sandeep.

And what of his own deewanapan? ?Sanaya and 

I will be getting married on January 16,? he announces.

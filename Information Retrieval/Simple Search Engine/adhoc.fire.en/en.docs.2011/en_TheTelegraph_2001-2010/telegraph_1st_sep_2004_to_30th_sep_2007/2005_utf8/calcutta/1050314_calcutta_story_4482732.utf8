Dying hard after plenty of pulp fiction

After 20 years in Hollywood, BRUCE WILLIS sounds a lot 

like a man who has nothing more to prove

Bruce Willis with M. Night Shyamalan and 

(above) with Demi MooreBruce in Tears of the Sun 

This man sure looks like Bruce Willis. As he sits 

on a stool in the bar of the Peninsula Hotel one recent afternoon, there is the 

familiar pate with the buzz-cut sides, there?s the Dick Tracy nose and the etched-in 

lines that frame his mouth, like parentheses. This guy has Willis?s low-key swagger, 

too, and, dressed in a grey V-neck sweater, jeans and cowboy boots, he?s got the 

man?s unfussy style.

But this doesn?t sound like Bruce Willis. Not the 

one who plops down on David Letterman?s upholstered chair every now and then, 

looking like he?s just been roused out of bed after a bender. Not the harmonica-playing, 

porn star-dating Willis, or the smirking action hero known for his signature ?yippy-ki-yay? 

from the three Die Hard movies. Nor does it seem like the Willis who apparently 

worked out a perfectly amicable child-sharing truce with his ex-wife Demi Moore.

Everything about that Willis says, ?You can?t take 

any of this seriously. Because it?s too much fun.?

?That?s one of the cards in my deck,? he says, when 

asked for the current whereabouts of Good Time Bruce. ?I?m having a ball. One 

of my mottos is to live it up. Early in life, I lost some friends, in freak accidents. 

We know that death is out there, waiting for us all, but most people are surprised 

by death. So I try to live in the moment.?

Junketing through town to promote Hostage, 

a thriller that opens in the American theatres, Willis seems subdued and reflective. 

Perhaps he?s channelling the character he plays in the film, a beleaguered cop 

who must rescue a family from a collection of miscreants and shadowy criminals 

in order to save the life of his wife and daughter.

In a career that now spans about 20 years and dozens 

of movies, maybe it?s hard to get bubbly every time out. At 49, Willis is entitled 

to some world-weariness. He?s survived the non-stop battering of the tabloids, 

which were obsessed with his married life and now seem just as interested in his 

bachelorhood. He?s endured his share of box-office fiascos, too, though he?s never 

fallen off Hollywood?s roster of A-list talent. 

Willis has been written about almost ceaselessly since 

1984, when he pulled off a Hollywood newcomer fantasy and beat out 3,000 actors 

for a starring role in Moonlighting, a huge television hit with Cybill 

Shepherd. At the time, Willis was a part-time bartender and New York stage actor 

who?d appeared mostly in off-off-Broadway productions, in theatres that held 300 

people. 

His transition from obscurity to fame didn?t go smoothly. 

?I still haven?t recovered from it,? he says. ?I don?t think I handled it very 

well, the first few years. I was 29. I wasn?t equipped for it and there?s nothing 

that prepares you for it.?

That was just the beginning. Willis became a bankable 

movie property in 1988, with Die Hard, his third film, which earned him 

a then-stunning $5 million fee and eventually launched a rickety fleet of imitators. 

Willis could have rehashed variations of this theme, but to his credit he took 

genuine risks. He did comedy (Death Becomes Her), sci-fi (12 Monkeys), 

psychological drama (Color of Night) and a period piece (Billy Bathgate). 

?He has constantly challenged himself as an actor, 

and most stars don?t do that,? says Jeffrey Katzenberg, the CEO of DreamWorks, 

a studio that is planning an animated film with Willis as one of the star voices. 

For years, no matter what he did, Willis in the public 

imagination often seemed like an action guy grasping for extra credit. Then came 

Pulp Fiction, the daddy of all independent films, released in 1994. In 

it, Willis is an ageing boxer named Butch, who risks his life to scam a bullying 

underworld boss paying him to throw a fight. Willis plays the character as a wily 

stoic who is just barely suppressing his fury and terror. There?s hardly an extra 

gesture, barely any visible emotions, but you know that under the surface Butch 

is boiling. Willis?s inspiration was Al Pacino in the Godfather movies, 

a minimalist performance and for Willis a major influence.

Pulp Fiction earned raves for Willis, and a 

few years later, when he appeared in The Sixth Sense, a creepy drama about 

dead people (no punching or punch lines) the choice seemed a bit daring but smart. 

Pulp also turned Willis into one of cinema?s rarest creatures: the unabashedly 

bald leading man. He?d been thinning since Moonlighting, but he was smooth 

as granite by the time he put on the gloves as Butch. He says he?s been thanked 

by hairless men ever since.

Bruce in Tears of the Sun 

Did anyone in Hollywood ever suggest, you know, a 

rug, or plugs, or something? ?No. And had they done so I would have told them 

to go.?

The oldest of four children, Willis had a confidence-sapping 

stutter as a kid and a reputation as a bit of a brawler. After his parents divorced, 

he lived with his father, a welder and pipe fitter. Willis worked for a time at 

a nearby DuPont chemical factory and was also a security guard at a nuclear power 

plant. He discovered acting at Montclair State College, where he appeared his 

first semester in a theatrical version of One Flew Over the Cuckoo?s Nest. 

To his amazement, his stammer vanished onstage.

?I was 19 and I knew what I wanted to do with the 

rest of my life,? he says. ?At the time I didn?t realise how fortunate I was.? 

He dropped out of college, then headed to Manhattan and a variety of odd jobs 

as he searched for gigs. He tended bar for years and lived in a crummy apartment 

in Hell?s Kitchen. He lived lean, he did drugs. In 1984, he auditioned with Madonna 

for a role in Desperately Seeking Susan and when he didn?t get it he flew 

to Los Angeles to visit a girlfriend and check out the Summer Olympics. His New 

York agent had an office there and he was sent on a couple of auditions. One was 

for Police Academy. The other was Moonlighting.

Willis had settled enough by 1987 to marry Demi Moore, 

and he?d developed a sufficient allergy to LA to move to a small town in Idaho 

called Hailey. For the couple, the idea was to rear their children in an environment 

as close to normal as you can get when both your parents are weekly fodder for 

People magazine. They lived on a 48-acre estate.

Willis and Moore split in 2000, and he no longer calls 

Hailey his home. ?About a year-and-a-half ago our kids came to us and said, ?We 

don?t want to live in the cold weather anymore,?? Willis says. The topic of Willis?s 

children ? Rumer, Scout and Tallulah, now all in their teens ? is about the only 

one that makes him glow. He calls them his favourite people in the world, then 

talks at length about childbirth, about the wonder of being in a delivery room 

and laying eyes on a newborn.

He sounds humbled for a moment. There?s a tone in 

his voice that?s absent when he discusses his next movies, or his sideline as 

a blues harmonica player and the band?s upcoming gig in Las Vegas. He sounds a 

lot like a man with nothing to prove.

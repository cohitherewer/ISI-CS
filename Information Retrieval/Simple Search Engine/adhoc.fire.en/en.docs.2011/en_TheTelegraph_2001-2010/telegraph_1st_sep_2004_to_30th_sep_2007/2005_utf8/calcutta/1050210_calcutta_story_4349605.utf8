The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Kitchen of undivided India

 - Bypass eatery to serve myriad mix of rare, extinct dishes

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Tender Pakistani Nihari Gosht, mouth-watering Wazwan cuisine, a Pakhtoon platter, Kerala Curry Meen, trout delicacies from Himachal? The Great Indian Spice Trail, coming up on the EM Bypass next to ITC Sonar Bangla, aims to bring together a myriad mix of signature dishes, some rare or extinct, from ?undivided India?.

 The 140-cover eatery in Spring Arcade, the convenience mall of Silver Spring, will open its doors by end-2005. It will mark Anjan Chatterjee?s third contribution to the city?s culinary cauldron after Mainland China and Oh Calcutta!

 ?The Trail will be a celebration of our culinary legacy from the pre-Partition days, since we strongly believe there shouldn?t be any food divide along political perimeters,? says Chatterjee, director, Speciality Restaurants Pvt Ltd.

 The ?undivided, apolitical? kitchen of The Great Indian Spice Trail will serve up ?original Kabuli Chana? and delicious street food from Lahore, alongside authentic cuisine from various regions of India and Bangladesh. ?It will be a dazzling silver lining at Silver Spring,? stresses developer Piyush Bhagat.

 Chatterjee is keen to go back to the basics for his Spice Trail venture. The restaurant will follow the age-old practice of using whole, not ground, spices, to preserve the essential flavour of each item. ?We will temper the dishes to be contemporary and suit the local palate, while retaining their subtlety,? says Chatterjee.

 An extensive excursion of Afghanistan and Pakistan is lined up. ?There will be trademark dishes like Pyaz ka Pulao, Khatte Piyaz ka Gosht and the world?s most divine dal from Amritsar Kesar Da Dhaba,? promises Chatterjee. Also on the cards are ?authentic non-vegetarian items? from Rajasthan like Safed Mans and Lal Mans. Vegetarians can gorge on Khumb, a speciality Kashmiri dish of delicate mushrooms, besides a combo of 16 ?do-good? saags. An array of extinct preparations of bitter gourd (?minus the bitterness?) will be on offer for the health-conscious.

 ?We are looking for rare and representative dishes? If any food lover comes forward with any authentic lost recipe, we are ready to include it on our bill of fare,? says Chatterjee.

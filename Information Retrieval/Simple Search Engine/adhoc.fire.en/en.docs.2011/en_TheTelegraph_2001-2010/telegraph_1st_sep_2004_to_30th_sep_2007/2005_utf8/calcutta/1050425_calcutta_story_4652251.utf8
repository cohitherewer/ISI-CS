 Art and elan for a cause

The Oberoi Grand, in association with Spandan Art, hosts Art Walk, an exhibition of paintings, and On the Ramp, a scintillating fashion show, to help raise funds to build Anubav. Showcasing original works from Spandan Art, Art Walk also offers viewers an opportunity to witness a painting in creation, which will be auctioned at the end of the show. Bibi Russell (picture above) then sets the ramp on fire with Indian and Bangladeshi models displaying her concept of cross-border fashion. Chief Guest: Vasundhara Raje Scindia, chief minister of Rajasthan.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Stranded tourists 

return

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The 23 tourists stranded in Himachal Pradesh due to floods returned to the city by train on Sunday. They were part of a Kundu Special package tour that had left for the state on June 21. 

 The team reached Chandigarh on June 23. From there, it travelled to Shimla on the same day. On June 25, the tourists arrived at Sangla Valley and checked in at Hotel Munal Residency. The day after, they were taken to Chitkul village. The plan was to set off for Kalpa the same day. 

 ?After returning to the hotel, we came to know that the eight bridges on the roads to Sangla had collapsed due to landslides. We were stranded,? recounted Krishna Mukherjee, a member of the team who stays in Santoshpur. 

 Soma Pilsima, daughter of Rabin Saha, one of the other tourists, said that she and her husband have been spending sleepless nights since June 26, worrying about her father. Saha had telephoned his daughter and son-in-law to inform them about the mishap. 

 ?It was a harrowing experience. Am I happy that my father is back!? Soma exclaimed. 

 The army started the rescue operation from June 27. Helicopters were used, but there weren?t enough of them to airlift all the stranded tourists. To make matters worse, the tourists quarrelled among themselves to be first to be rescued. 

 ?On June 1, an army helicopter airlifted us to Ramgarh. We went to Kalka from there and boarded the 2312 Down Kalka-Howrah mail on the same day. The train arrived in Howrah at 10.15 am on Sunday,? Mukherjee said.

 It wasn?t all suffering, though. ?There was no dearth of food, thanks to the tour operator. Besides, the helicopter ride was thrilling. It afforded a breathtaking view of the magnificent Himalayan ranges. I will never forget the experience,? said Mukherjee.

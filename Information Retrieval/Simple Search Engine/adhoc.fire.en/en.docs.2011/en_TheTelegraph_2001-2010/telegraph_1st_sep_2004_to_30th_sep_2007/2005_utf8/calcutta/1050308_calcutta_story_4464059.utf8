The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Women cheer loud and clear

SANGITA SULTANIA G. ROY

Girls just wanna have fun. And if boys continue to be boys, rushing to the nearest watering hole after the day?s deed is done, girls are doing their own thing too.

 As an increasing number of women explode on the night scene, fewer eyebrows arch over a woman nursing her drink and lighting a cigarette with the one flick of a manicured hand. And, of course, she pays her own bills at the end of it all.

 In case you haven?t come across her already at any nightclub worth its strobe lights, meet today?s woman who believes in working hard and partying as hard as her male counterpart.

 ?Over the last two years there has been a 40 per cent growth in female footfalls in the party circuit,? says Anirban Simlai, director food and beverages, The Park. Girls? night out is a common feature, he affirms.

 Raising a toast to woman power, between bouts on the dance floor with women friends, is 30-something Sonali: ?We don?t need men to pay our bills anymore!?

 And boy (or should we say girl), are these women running up some bill. As hotel insiders reveal, most women these days are hooked on to wine, and that shows in the final tally.

 ?All women in my group are wine drinkers,? says event manager Geetanjali Jolly. ?What I like about wine is that it?s a very controlled drink. I enjoy the gradual high of wine,? adds Geetanjali.

 It helps that there are more varieties of wines to choose from, now. ?India is producing a lot of good wine. Besides, a lot of international brands are coming in from Australia, Chile and Argentina. Wine has also become a lot cheaper now,? says Simlai. 

 The second popular choice for women continues to be the white spirits category. ?Women are by and large figure conscious. Bacardi white with diet coke is a hot favourite. They also like to experiment with drinks like Rigo, a new flavoured drink from Bacardi that combines the taste of lime cordial and soda. And, of course, the Breezer continues to sell like hot cakes among women,? observes DJ Girish from Shisha.

 The 22 Camac Street hot spot has been luring large girl gangs by providing a comfort zone and often dedicating special nights to women.

 ?Fewer women go in for beer due to the large calorie content in the drink, and there is a select whiskey-drinking among women that really parties till late,? observes Girish, casting a bird?s eye view over the proceedings from his console corner.

 Exotic cocktails also rate high on the drink menu of women. ?By and large women have refined taste and more and more of them are moving towards cocktails like Martini and Cosmopolitan,? says Vikram Achanta, co-founder and CEO of Delhi-based tulleho.com, a site dedicated to booze basics.

 ?We have been conducting bartending workshops and wine appreciation sessions all over the country since 2001 and 40 per cent of the participants are women,? adds Achanta.

 The party has begun in right earnest, but social norms are yet to switch gears and hit today?s track. Result: no-go zones and don?t-do diktats for women on the fun trail.

 ?While my male colleagues can go drink at any neighbourhood bar after a hard day?s grind, women have to pay many times more for the same fun at a swank joint, usually of five-star category,? rues Priti Shah.

 The banker is one among many women to have faced the ignominy of being refused alcohol at several bars in the city only because she wasn?t accompanied by a man.

 ?They don?t allow women (without men) in most bars in the city,? admits S.K. Khullar, senior vice president of Hotel and Restaurant Association of Eastern India (HRAEI).

 Unaware of any excise law debarring women from being served alcohol if not accompanied by a man, Khullar puts it down to Calcutta still being, by and large, a conservative city.

 Pub culture hasn?t really kicked in, despite the sudden spurt in the number of nightclubs in the city. ?The scenario is quite different in Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore, but Calcutta has not caught up,? reveals Khullar.

 The veteran restaurateur, however, concedes that the day is not far off when Calcutta will see women?s-only bars and pubs.

 Till then, you can drown the discrimination in your next drink!

 Stirring it up, Thai style

 A cookery workshop showcasing authentic Thai delicacies was the order of the day at the Rosewood banquet hall of The Park on December 14. Around 25 women lapped up dishes whipped up by chef Nut Kunlert. Among the participants were Kathy Hall and Anna Hall, wife and daughter of the British deputy high commissioner, Kathleen Jardine, the US consul generals wife, and members of Calcutta International Womens Club. 

 The dishes are easy to cook at home. The other factor that I have kept in mind is the easy availability of ingredients in the market, says chef Nut Kunlert.

 The workshop included demonstrations on a full-course meal that comprised a soup, Tom Kha Kai (mild spiced flavoured chicken in coconut milk), an appetiser Thod Man Kao Phod (Thai corn cake), a main-course item Phea Phad Nam Man Hoi (lamb in oyster sauce) and a dessert Kluey Bued Chee (banana in sweet coconut milk).

 Star struck

 The hospitality industry here has added yet another feather to its cap. ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton amp; Towers has recently achieved Five-Star Rating from the British Safety Council for Health and Safety Management System.

 The five-star rating is the highest under the British Safety Council. The rating is a reflection of the objective and quantifiable benchmarking achieved by the hotel towards health and safety management systems.

 The audit conducted in August 2005 focuses on safety organisation that covers first-aid facility, risk assessment, management control system, fire control system, general upkeep of plant and machineries and more.

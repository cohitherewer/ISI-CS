 Most visitors to the Sunderbans are ignorant of its fragile eco-system. Their behaviour and the high-decibel noise emitted by their speedboats or launches not only deter the wildlife, but affect the ecology of the world?s largest riverine delta.

 Alarmed over the situation, officials manning the eco-reserve have decided to streamline cruises into the deeps of the tide country.

 To begin with, the authorities have identified six routes that will be left open for tour operators to ferry tourists ? both from within the country and abroad. All other routes will be ?heavily guarded? to prevent sneak-ins.

 Before leaving with tourists, operators will have to attach silencers to their launches or speedboats. This will ensure peace and calm of wildlife is maintained and the tourists enjoy a noiseless cruise.

 ?The idea is to make the visitors feel comfortable in the forests and keep the delicate ecosystem undisturbed,? said Pradeep Vyas, field director, Sunderbans Tiger Reserve Project. ?We don?t want visitors to leave with a bad taste. The delta is one of the most favourite haunts and tours must be handled professionally, with a system of accountability.?

 As part of the initiative, local operators of launches and mechanised boats have been asked to attend a training camp, at which tourism experts will offer basic tips on ways to handle tourists out on a cruise. Besides, a special eco-tourism squad, comprising trained members, has been set up. The squad will criss-cross the six tourist pathways to see whether tour operators are abiding by the norms or not.

 ?The members of the squad will keep a vigil on launches to ensure that noise emitted by the engines do not cross the permissible limit. One must cruise in silence to catch a glimpse of the wildlife on the banks,? said a senior member of the eco-tourism group.

 Officials of the Sunderbans Tiger Reserve Project have also decided to educate 23 local youths on the rich bio-diversity of the delta, so they could act as tourist guides. The youths will be handed over books and binoculars to help guide tourists.

 On board a launch, each tourist will be given a feedback form, which is to be filled, detailing experiences and problems, and to be dropped in boxes in Pakhiralaya and Dobaki.

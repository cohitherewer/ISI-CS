The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Denial cry in beam blackout

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Broadcaster STAR India termed the non-availability of some of its channels in several lakh Calcutta cable households as ?wrongful denial of service? on Friday. 

 Multi-system operator (MSO) SitiCable had switched off STAR One, Hungama, Disney and Toon Disney channels on December 20, owing to a dues dispute with Indian Cable Net, an affiliate of SitiCable. 

 Although another city MSO, Manthan, followed suit ?in solidarity?, SitiCable?s Purvalaya arm did not. 

 For SitiCable viewers, a message has replaced the channels: ?STAR One, Hungama, Disney, Toon Disney channels are part of Package 2 of STAR TV. Now, since an MRP of Rs 28 per TV per month is being asked for, these channels are withdrawn from our cable network in the interest of our subscribers...? 

 ?The message misinforms cable operators and subscribers and is a wrongful denial of service,? said a STAR official from Mumbai. 

 ?These MSOs signed STAR?s Package 2 agreement, effective September 2005? It appears to be an excuse by these MSOs to avoid making due subscription payments,? he signed off.

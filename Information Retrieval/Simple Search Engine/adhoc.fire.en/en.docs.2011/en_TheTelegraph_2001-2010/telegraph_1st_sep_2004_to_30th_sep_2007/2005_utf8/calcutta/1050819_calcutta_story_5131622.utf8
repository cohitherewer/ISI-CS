 TV truths

 Kaun Banega Crorepati took the nation by storm, Indian Idol created a frenzy, and Channel [V]?s super singer Rabindra Upadhyay has started causing ripples in the music industry. This proves the appeal of reality TV shows, fast catching on in India after major success in the west. Why does it appeal to the masses? The lack of pre-rehearsed scripts and artificial emotions help the audience identify with the common man on the screen. They also love the experience of watching ugly ducklings turn into swans. Their hopes and aspirations fluctuate with that of the on-screen entities. One of the biggest reality shows in India was Indian Idol. Everyone voted at least 10 times for their favourite singer. But Fame Gurukul has failed to generate the same amount of interest, partly due to bad publicity after the fiasco at the first audition in Calcutta. Also, after Indian Idol, expectations were high. But the most important question is whether power and politics are at play here, or perhaps a faulty voting system? These talent hunts raise the hopes of people. But whether they tap the nation?s talent or choose the right person to be the ?magical voice? is debatable.

 Young leaders

 In developing countries, where three-fourths of the population is under 30 with limited access to employment, education and training opportunities, youth service is critical. The US recognises it as an important tool in a democracy. We need to recognise young people not simply as leaders of tomorrow, but as leaders of today, playing important roles at local, national and global levels. Where hunger and disease are rampant among adults, teenagers head households. No employment and education results in destructive habits like drug use, risky sexual behaviour, alcoholism, gang violence, rape and prostitution. By providing young people with opportunities to participate in community development, youth services can offer constructive alternatives by helping them become positive resources for change. Such integrative services are beneficial in increasing civic activity and understanding the forces that shape government and society. It also allows democracy to evolve according to the needs and traditions of diverse political cultures.

 SMS speak

 One of the most prominent changes noticeable today is in the field of communication. Sitting in my college canteen, I noticed the drastic change in the way we speak these days. I heard two first-years speaking to each other. One asked the other: ?Are you Bong??, and it struck me that we are not known as Bengalis any more. We are Bongs and our vocabulary has been re-loaded and remixed. How do you calm down an angry friend? Say ?chillax?, or ?take a chill pill?. Are you tense? Don?t worry, leave it all to ?Bhaggu?. He?s a real ?brain surgeon?, can I have some ?Bubbly, dude??... It?s not about abbreviations, as in SMSing. The intention is to communicate with style and ease. I find it amazing to be part of this linguistic revolution. It?s a new world.

 Failed freedom

 It was different from all other Monday mornings ? August 15. The ceremony included hoisting the flag, singing the national anthem ? the celebration of 58 years of our Independence. But are we really free? I know it is not fair for me to raise this question since I don?t know what people born before Independence went through. But I do blame our daily situation, our environment and what the country has given us. Does everyone understand the significance of independence? No. Nor does everyone enjoy the same freedom. But each year we celebrate our independence.

 Tease terror

 Five Class XII students eve-teasing actress June at City Centre was disgraceful. When we were in school, fun outside campus was limited to eating ice cream, hanging around in video game parlours or going for a movie. But the scenario has changed drastically. Spoilt brats from affluent backgrounds entertain themselves by harassing women. It?s a matter of shame that these youths don?t even have respect for a mother. The obvious question is: why the moral degradation of youth? The main reason is the pressures of modern life and a blatantly consumerist Indo-American culture. Women are portrayed as sex objects on screen. Music videos are full of scantily-clad women making moves more suited to X-rated movies. Mothers, too, have a hand in spoiling their sons, especially in affluent families. If young boys are taught to see women as human beings and not as objects of carnal pleasure, then they will grow up to be healthy citizens. It?s unfortunate that teenagers ape American culture. It?s natural for a boy at puberty to be attracted to a girl. But boys must realise that eve-teasing or molestation is not ?cool?. It?s a crime.

 Chit Chat

 The enemy 

 Lying on a rocking chair, beside our paddy field,

 Was my mother, eyes shut, ears open and lips both sealed.

 Being blind, little could she distinguish between night and day,

 But all she knew was that the war was taking her son away.

 She had an illusion that she could keep me back,

 But I had to go and answer the enemy?s sudden attack.

 So I wore my uniform and put on my shoes.

 Between mother and motherland, it was the latter I did choose.

 The charisma in her face no longer could I see.

 Her ostracised expression was continuously troubling me.

 Away I went, after silently touching her feet,

 Not knowing whether we would ever again meet. 

 The forces retaliated, answering a sudden infiltration.

 By killing unknowns, the fa?ade put up was beyond limitation.

 From both sides, the superfluous flow of bullets were fired,

 The way in which men fell was too rhythmic to be admired.

 The mystic atmosphere grew denser as the war carried,

 Men got hit, men fell and men parried.

 Finally, the bloodbath did stop

 And the enemies? weapons ultimately did drop.

 The scene was bloody, the scene was red.

 Thousands of men injured, thousands dead.

 My friends lay cold, on their motherland.

 The tricolour gripped firmly in their hand.

 Who was the friend, who was the foe?

 This none of us will ever know.

 But we do know that all of us are but the same,

 Fighting for a part of the Earth, under a different name.

 The native girl 

 Unreal cities, 

 Scampering along the shells of your psyche? 

 And you wait for another? form 

 Perhaps a black form? 

 To smell the eye? 

 The eye you preserved for million deaths 

 Between the brown lips 

 Of the native girl? 

 She had promised to think? 

 She had promised 

 To think once more? 

 Among every unreal city 

 (Dedicated to poet Percy B. Shelley)

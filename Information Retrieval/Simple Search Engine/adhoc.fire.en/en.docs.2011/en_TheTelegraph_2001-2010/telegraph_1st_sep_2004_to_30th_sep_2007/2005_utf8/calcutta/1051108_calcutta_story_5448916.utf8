 Family fashion: Pets on the ramp 

 - Parade of animals and animal-lovers to raise funds for medical shelter

 RESHMI SENGUPTA

 After a gruelling day under the spotlight, they just love coming home to Goldie, Bhonda or Tweedledee. Those who don?t have someone to wag a tail and curl up at their feet are also not blind to the bond. And together, for the first time in town, they will take pet passion to the ramp, for a cause.

 A clutch of celebrities will do the catwalk, pet animals at heel or in hand, at CC amp;FC on November 12. Claws, Paws, Tails and Style is a fundraiser organised by Animal Relief and Care Society, in association with The Telegraph.

 ?We will build a shelter with proper treatment facilities that include a trauma-handling unit,? says Radhika Bose of the NGO working with stray and abandoned animals.

 Those ready to hit the ramp are Swastika Mukherjee with Bhonda, June with her goldfish or a Pug or a Labrador, Madhumanti Maitra with her pet streetdog Toto (instead of her beloved but ?shy? cats), and a star army of animal-lovers.

 Those ramp-walkers who don rsquo;t own a pet but are comfortable with them will be provided with one by the NGO. The line-up of dogs for the show includes Great Dane, Golden Retriever, Pug, Collie and Basset Hound. ldquo;We will have different sequences and some of them will be with animals, rdquo; says Oindrilla Dutt of Open Doors, who tracked down celebrities sympathetic to the cause.

 The line-up reads like a city celeb roster mdash; Sabyasachi Chakraborty, Chandrayee Ghosh, Arindam Sil, Bikram Ghosh, Tanushree Shankar, Priti Patel, Sharmila Biswas, Suvaprasanna, Piu Sarkar, Mona-Pali mdash; rounded off by a bevy of models led by Shonal Rawat.

 For many, pets are family. ldquo;My five dogs are growing up along with my five-year-old daughter Anwesha. On Saturday, I will be on the ramp with Bhonda. My daughter will also be on the ramp, with a Miniature Daschund owned by my uncle, rdquo; smiles actress Swastika.

 June, proud owner of goldfish Goldie, is most particular about its upkeep. ldquo;I change the water every alternate day and feed it before leaving for work, rdquo; says the actress, who rsquo;s planning to walk with ldquo;a Pug or a Lab, if not Goldie rdquo;.

 Madhumanti, for one, dotes on her feline friends. ldquo;Cats look after themselves, you don rsquo;t have to mollycoddle them. If you sterilise a female cat, she will be the most hassle-free pet you can have. They are very loving and giving, unlike what most people think them to be mdash; selfish, rdquo; says the newsreader and emcee who divides her time between 11-year-old Kich and nine-and-a-half-year-old-Tweedledee. But cats are ldquo;very shy rdquo;, so Madhumanti could take one-year-old Toto to the ramp, instead.

 ldquo;One doesn rsquo;t need to own a pet in order to be an animal lover. If we show compassion towards the stray dogs in our locality and take care of them, it rsquo;s more than enough, rdquo; feels actress-turned-animal activist Nilanjanaa, who regrets missing out on the fashion show due to personal commitments.

 On Saturday, designers Snehasish Bhattacharya, Sayon Mitra, Shamlu Dudeja, Jayasree Chatterjee and the boutique Darbari will dress up the celebrities, with jewellery by BC Sen. Fashion apart, the show will have a performance by Anjum Katyal and Francis Lepcha.

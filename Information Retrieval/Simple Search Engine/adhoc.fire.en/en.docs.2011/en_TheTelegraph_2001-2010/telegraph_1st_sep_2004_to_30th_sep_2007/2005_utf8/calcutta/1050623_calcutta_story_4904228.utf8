The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Muscle to mettle

 From a stunning supermodel to a cold-blooded villain ? the jump cut from ramp to reel life couldn?t have been more dramatic for Rahul Dev. After debuting as a villain in Padam Kumar?s Champion co-starring Sunny Deol and Manisha Koirala, Rahul has essayed quite a few ?positive? roles, like in Asoka, but nothing has quite clicked like the spine-chilling stare and harsh looks.

 Rahul never wished all that hype away but he has also been keen to break the stereotype. Now, the opportunity has come in the form of Games Bond, a virtual reality gaming show on STAR One. As the host, Rahul needs to chat up people, pep it up with his sense of humour and carry it alone on his sturdy shoulders.

 But unlike younger brother Mukul, who?s a household name thanks to the popular sitcom Gharwali Uparwali, Rahul doesn?t want to translate the TV stint into a long-term affair. ?It?s a one-off thing for me. But if the first 13 episodes of Games Bond are successful, it will be carried on for some more. But my passion is films,? says he.

 The chiselled-featured model switched to acting three years ago with Champion, the film which marked Dev out as a man with screen menace, capable of matching Sunny Deol blow for blow. ?Till now, I have had 10 releases and the negative-positive role ratio has been 50-50. But the awards and accolades have all come for the negative ones, like Champion and Footpath. But the films in which I had a positive role were better received, like Asoka and Shaheed Bhagat Singh,? says Dev, presently with a bunch of films which have him in the two shades and more.

 Dev plays a ?nice man? (a cop) in Jaane Hoga Kya, starring Aftab Shivdasani, Preity Zinta and Bipasha Basu and a terrorist in Sarhad Paar alongside Sanjay Dutt. Then there?s Benaam besides Ajay Devgan, Bhumika Chawla and Sameera Reddy, Sohail Khan?s Fight Club and Phansi with Kay Kay Menon.

 But do any of these roles offer him the scope to show his mettle? ?No, I am still looking for that one role I will be extremely happy doing. And I don?t care whether it?s negative or positive. For instance, Maqbool is not a successful film but it is excellent. I am looking forward to those kinds of films,? says he.

 March 13 was one of the happiest days in the life of Bimal Mahato, when he won the Airtel The Telegraph Kolkata Marathon. A few days later was his saddest, when the champion returned to his village in Gaidua, near Kharagpur.

 Soon after hearing from neighbours and friends that his son had emerged on top and bagged the prize money of Rs 2 lakh, Sudhir Chandra Mahato suffered a stroke. 

 ?He had had a stroke earlier and this one proved fatal,? recalls Bimal, a Railway Protection Force employee. ?I broke down and decided never to run again,? says the champion, who has participated in races across the country.

 Now, the people who brought the marathon to Calcutta are trying to ease Mahato out of his depression by helping him participate in the prestigious New York Marathon. 

 ?He has become someone kids in the districts look up to,? says Prochy Mehta, organising secretary of the Calcutta marathon. ?We had to do something to bring him back.?

 Counselling helped rid Mahato of his guilt. ?My friends told me that even Sachin Tendulkar lost his father when he was playing, but he didn?t stop,? muses Mahato. Psychologists tried to explain that the death had nothing to do with the news, it would have happened anyway.

 ?We then thought of getting him to participate in an international marathon,? explains Mehta. London, Boston and New York were short-listed. ?London and Boston are in April and he would not be fit so soon, so we decided on New York, which is in November.?

 The list of things to do is long. ?His kit would cost around Rs 40,000, including several pairs of shoes,? adds Mehta. Uncomfortable shoes had forced Mahato to run the final seven km-stretch of the Calcutta marathon barefoot.

 A private airline has offered to sponsor a ticket, and the search is on for a Bengali family in New York that will give him a place to stay and help him feel at home. 

 The Athletic Coaches Association of Bengal is helping out the self-trained man with guidance. Other costs include the entry fee of $200.

 Mahato is keen to get back in form. ?My health is getting better and I?ll start training soon,? he says. Gruelling days of running 200 km every week, swimming, gym training and more lie ahead, but the father of two is ready to take the challenge. ?It will be a big event, with world-class athletes trying their best, but I?ll be running for my father,? he promises.

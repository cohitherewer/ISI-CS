The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 The foodstalls in the BBD Bag, Chowringhee and Camac Street areas lack basic 

hygiene due to shortage of water. When authorities cannot evict them, they should, 

at least, supply water to the stalls so that they can serve better quality food 

to office-goers. The authorities can provide proper support to these hawkers and 

help them set up the stalls on stretches which are not already crowded during 

rush hour. Will the Calcutta Municipal Corporation do something about it?

 Elderly people fondly recollect the way the birth anniversary of Netaji used 

to be celebrated in the city till a decade ago. Nowadays, though the day is observed 

with a few public functions, there seems to be a lack of wholehearted participation 

by Calcuttans, especially the younger generation. It is unfortunate that youngsters 

prefer whiling away their time instead of spending even a few minutes paying tribute 

to yesteryear?s heroes.

 During a recent visit to Laldighi I found people sitting on the brick wall 

around it. There have been many incidents of drowning in this lake in the past. 

Authorities should construct cemented seats along the lake so that people can 

enjoy the surroundings. Also, as the area is of much historical importance, authorities 

should maintain it to attract tourists.

 It appears that the transport minister has once again succumbed to the pressure 

tactics of the transport operators and allowed hike in bus and taxi fares. Surprisingly, 

during every previous hike he had promised people of more comfortable public vehicles. 

I don?t think the claim of private bus owners of incurring losses is true as they 

fill the buses till passengers suffocate. Henceforth, representatives of commuters 

must be included in meetings that decide fare hikes. 

 Kalyan Ray Chaudhuri, Maniktala. 

 Recently, I went to see my wife off at Howrah station. When I went to buy a 

platform ticket, I found unending queues in front of all the counters. As there 

was not much time left for the train to leave, I had to enter the station without 

it. Platform tickets are issued along with tickets for local trains. Why not open 

a separate counter for issuing platform tickets? Those who are to board a long 

distance train prefer reaching the station with just half-an-hour in hand. But 

those escorting them do not get much time to buy the platform ticket.

 Govind Das Dujari, Behala.

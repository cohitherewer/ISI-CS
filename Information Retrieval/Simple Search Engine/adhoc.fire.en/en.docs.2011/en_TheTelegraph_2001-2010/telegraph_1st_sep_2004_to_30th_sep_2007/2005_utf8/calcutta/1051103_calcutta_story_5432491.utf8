 Arjun Rampal in Ek Ajnabee

 Last time, and the only time, Arjun Rampal scored at the box-office was when he was playing cat-and-mouse with Amitabh Bachchan in Vipul Shah?s Aankhen. So now that he gets to be in the same team with the Big B, the handsome model-turned-actor is really hopeful of cooking up a hit with Apurva Lakhia?s Ek Ajnabee, which releases in December.

 ?It is a very, very different project,? reasons Arjun. ?I have known Apurva for a long time, much before he made his first film Mumbai Se Aaya Mera Dost. When he came to me with a bound script, I found my character to be very unusual and I agreed to do the film.? He does add after a couple of seconds: ?I was, of course, getting the opportunity to work with Mr Bachchan again.?

 Ek Ajnabee is a remake of the Denzel Washington-Dakota Fanning-starrer Man On Fire, where an out-of-work cop gets all excited again when picked to protect a child. Arjun, however, denies direct links with the Hollywood blockbuster. ?I have seen Man On Fire and our film is very different from that. Like my character is not even there in the English film. In fact, Apu has adapted the original French novel for his film and has incorporated elements of his own.?

 Rating Apurva very highly Arjun believes that Ek Ajnabee will turn things around for the director who has assisted many a big name in the West. ?He has been very thorough with everything,? Arjun says. ?So the organised format helped finish the film in the scheduled 35 days in Bangkok. He?s really worked hard on the film and brought out something new in all of us. He?s given the film a very sleek look and yet not lost out on the whole weave of the storytelling.?

 Playing a cool cop would have been a welcome change for Arjun after the disastrous Vaada, where he hammed away as a blind man much to the agony of the audience. ?People who know me and have seen Ek Ajnabee believe that I am more myself in the movie,? he claims. ?That was one of the reasons I agreed to do the film in the first place ? I got to be me for a change.?

 The other reason ? Amitabh Bachchan ? was worth it too. ?Almost all my scenes in the film are with Mr Bachchan,? Arjun reveals. ?And it?s just great working with him. He is a wonderful human being, a thorough professional and charges you up instantly. There are so many things to learn from him. On the sets, the man is so inspirational to everyone else. He really tends to bring out the best in you.?

 Post-Ek Ajnabee, Arjun has a lot to look forward to. He?s just back from New York after doing a cameo in Karan Johar?s forthcoming magnum opus Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna. He is currently shooting for one of the episodes of Ram Gopal Varma?s Darna Zaroori Hai opposite Bipasha Basu under the direction of Prawaal Raman. And then, early-2006 sees Arjun do a Pran in Farhan Akhtar?s remake of Don with Shah Rukh Khan and Priyanka Chopra. ?I?m really happy that I am getting to work with the best directors in the industry,? he smiles.

 Thieves invade high court

 - 1,000-plus books of law stolen

 The corridors of Calcutta High Court: Justice under siege. A Telegraph picture

 The battleline is drawn: legal eagles versus pilferers. The battleground: Calcutta High Court corridors. At stake: priceless books of law.

 The citadel of justice, the oldest court in the country established in 1862, seems to have been infiltrated by thieves, who have stolen more than 1,000 books and documents belonging to lawyers over the past four months.

 At least 20 lawyers have lost their books, prompting the practitioners of law to lodge complaints with the assistant commissioner of the high court police. President of the High Court Bar Association Sardar Amjad Ali has mentioned the matter before a judge, who has directed police to immediately identify the thieves and recover the stolen books.

 Acting on the order, the authorities have deployed undercover cops to keep a watch on the books. ?We are sure the thieves will be apprehended soon,? said the officer-in-charge of the high court police. 

 ?Many of us keep our books stacked along the corridors for ready reference. It is impossible for our clerks to carry the tomes from bar association rooms to a courtroom while a case is being heard. The thieves are taking advantage of this,? said Ali.

 Space crunch, too, forces lawyers to keep books, journals and legal documents along the corridors. At present, there are more than 5,900 bar association members attached to the high court. But with only around 200 rooms and 80 chambers available, about 2,000 lawyers rarely get an opportunity to sit.

 Among the lawyers whose books have been stolen is former minister of the state Kashikanta Moitra. Six of his valuable books, containing important judgments of the Supreme Court, have disappeared.

 Another senior member of the bar, R.N. Majumdar, is missing five such books. Majumdar had recently mentioned the matter before Justice Jayant Biswas, who expressed concern over the issue. ?To us, these books are priceless. Some of them are very rare,? Majumdar told Metro.

 Lakshmi Pal, another senior lawyer, is the worst sufferer ? 11 of his books have been lifted from in front of the main gate of the Chief Justice?s courtroom. Pal has informed the acting Chief Justice and also lodged a complaint with the high court authorities.

 Normally, a sentry is deployed in each of the 34 courtrooms, 20 policemen keep vigil along the judges? corridors and 10 more maintain security in various offices, like those of the advocate-general, government pleader and the caretaker. However, with over 10,000 visitors turning up daily, it?s difficult to keep a constant watch on the books stacked along the corridors.

 The books, many of them out of print, are bulky ? weighing between two kg and 10 kg and costing more than Rs 1,000 each. 

 Written by eminent lawyers and former judges of various high courts or the Supreme Court, the books contain elaborate definitions of laws and interpretations of Acts passed by the assemblies and Parliament.

 The lawyers use them frequently to cite precedents to strengthen their arguments. Judges, too, consult such books before writing verdicts.

 Military exposition

 Commissioned by the British Council on the occasion of its 11th Indian Triennale, Roderick Buchanans new work, History Painting, is a 35 mm film transferred to DVD. It features newly passed-out soldiers from the Madras Regiment in Tamil Nadu and their counterparts in the Scottish Infantry Division in Scotland. The ongoing exhibition on the same theme, with images from the Victoria Memorial collection, raises important questions regarding the conventional representation of the military in art and literature. As in Buchanan?s work, the show, instead of presenting heroic, larger-than-life portraits, focuses on the common, usually anonymous private soldier, with whom the ordinary viewer can identify and empathise. The rows of youthful faces wearing passive expressions provide a blunt, yet true picture of the reality of life in the army. Ultimately, the simplicity of form of the men in uniform gives them a dimension of gravity and complexity.

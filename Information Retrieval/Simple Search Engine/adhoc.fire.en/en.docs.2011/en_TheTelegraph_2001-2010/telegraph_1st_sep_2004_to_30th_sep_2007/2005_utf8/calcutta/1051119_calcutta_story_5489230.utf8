The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A quest for the marvellous

 - PHANTOM CHANDELIERS amp; CROSS

 Olivier Urman before his Aeroplane. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya

 In a spellbinding scene from Cocteau?s film based on the fairytale of Beauty and the Beast, unbeknown to her, an enchanted castle comes alive as the maiden enters it. 

 Behind her back, the eyes of the marble statues follow her every movement as their eyeballs dart from corner to corner.

 If one contemplated the 13 phantom chandeliers created by Paris-based Olivier Urman long enough, one would have felt that the black-and-white images keep slipping between the real and the unreal with every blink of the eye. 

 The works were displayed at Akar Prakar gallery for two days, beginning Thursday. The exhibition was organised by the French Association.

 Urman has had a chequered career. He was trained as a doctor, he belonged to a rock group and from the late 80s, he decided to work with metal. He created steel structures of costumes for major Paris revues in Lido, Moulin Rouge and for opera, too. He has also created single wrought iron pieces.

 In the past, he has created ?furniture? with opaque plexiglass ? ?common things of a flat?, as he puts it. 

 His framed chandeliers could be seen through a sheet of partially hazy plexiglass instead of glass, giving these large images their spectral look. 

 His earlier ironing board, shelves, lamps and other quotidian objects share that look, and the philosophy behind displaying these, he explains in simple English, is: ?You can have a thing and you can make a sculpture of this.?

 In other words, when something that we see or use all the time is put on display, it is immediately invested with the mystique of an object of art. It is up to the viewer either to accept or reject his point of view, but Urman?s chandeliers do have a numinous quality.

 Urman, who was in town for the opening, says he had downloaded many of the images from the Internet and worked on them digitally. These are giant lustres with many branches and dripping with thousands of crystal drops. In some, the light is smudged out, leaving behind pools of sooty black.

 These images resonate with remembrances of the huge chandelier hanging from the ceiling of Satayjit Ray?s Jalsaghar. 

 ?I was obsessed with stopping time. These pictures are like ghosts coming out of memory. They are marvellous images and I like them to be permanent. Marvellous things are related to infinity and infinity is close to death.?

 In his quest for the marvellous, he has struck upon the image of the aeroplane, with its aura of speed, light, destruction and fantasy. 

 Then suddenly, the flying machine turned into a new-found symbol of the Cross. An image transmuted by imagination.

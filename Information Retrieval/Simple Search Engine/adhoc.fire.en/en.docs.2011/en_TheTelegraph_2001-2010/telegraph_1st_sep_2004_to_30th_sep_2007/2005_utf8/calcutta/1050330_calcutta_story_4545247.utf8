 The day before Holi, I saw some vendors on footpaths along Dum Dum Road, at 

Chiria More, selling a variety of coloured powder in small glass bottles. They 

were using big tin containers labelled ?Industrial Colour? for storing the colour. 

When I asked the vendor why he was selling such hazardous colours, he promptly 

replied ?shob cholbe?. Most of us are unaware of the harmful effects of 

using such colours on the skin and eyes. The authorities should ban the sale of 

colours with high content of harmful chemicals.

 I am a heart patient and was admitted to Airway Nursing Home some time back. There are a few residential buildings in its vicinity. The residents in one of the flats would play music at a high volume every afternoon ? just when the patients at the nursing home retire for a siesta. I request the police and the local administration to curb this nuisance as areas around hospitals and nursing homes should be silence zones.

 I was fined Rs 100 recently at the Lovers Lane-Kidderpore Road crossing for 

violation of a traffic signal. I think the fault lies with the signalling system. 

The significance of the amber light is seldom understood, especially when the 

signals are manually operated. The duration for which the amber signal is on should 

depend on the volume of traffic at the crossing. At that crossing, the amber light 

should last long enough for vehicles to cross the tram tracks and negotiate the 

steep turn comfortably. On many occasions, I have had to step on the brakes all 

of a sudden at a crossing because of the signal turning from green to red abruptly. 

 Naren Kini, Dover Place. 

 A huge banyan tree was uprooted from a spot on Darga Road, near bridge no. 

4. But the hole has not been repaired. Darga Road is a busy one and has already 

witnessed a major accident a few months back. We hope the authorities will mend 

the road to avoid mishaps. 

 Mehjibin Yunus, Bright Street. 

 The Rabindra Sadan authorities have cleared the garbage that was strewn around 

the waterbodies on its premises. The garbage dump at one corner of the complex 

has also been removed. I believe this has happened after my letter was published 

in this column on March 9 (Movie zone as littered lair).

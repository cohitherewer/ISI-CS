The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 One of the most visible symbols of Indian economic resurgence is the spread of mobile telephony across the country. In just a decade, the ubiquitous ?cell? has come a long way. At over 50 million users, there are more mobile phone subscribers in the country today than landline subscribers. The first, rather bulky, handsets cost almost half a lakh of rupees. Today, even feature-laden ?smart phones? fit snugly into the palm and can be picked up for a fraction of that price. And it all started right here in Calcutta, on July 31, 1995, when the then chief minister, Jyoti Basu, called up Union communications minister Sukh Ram in Delhi

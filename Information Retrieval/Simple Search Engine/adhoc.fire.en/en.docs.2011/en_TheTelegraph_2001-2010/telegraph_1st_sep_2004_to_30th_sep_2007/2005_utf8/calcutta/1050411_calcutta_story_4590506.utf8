The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

You can?t get through this week without

Making a splash

 And you better do it before all the blue in 

the city pools disappears in a sea of red, yellow and green swimming gear. The 

swimming season has begun in right earnest, so enroll now or be left out in the 

heat. We leave it to you to decide what to do with the tan that you might prefer 

to do without.

Finding Neverland

 The Oscar-nominated flick about J.M. Barrie 

is a must watch for Peter Pan fans, specially the grown-up kids amongst us. Catch 

dashing Johnny Depp drown in the world of castles and kings, cowboys and Indians, 

pirates and castaways with Kate Winslet?s four fatherless boys. A little light 

fantasy is just the recipe director Marc Foster ordered to enliven a lazy summer 

afternoon.

Baisakhi binge

 Not all yuppies may identify with Poila Baisakh 

celebrations, but hey, it never hurts to hog! Add to it new gifts and gear and 

you?d most certainly wish for a new year every month!

 Whenever you see colour, think India, even if the theme is ice. That was clear, crystal clear, at the media reception and party that announced the launch of crystal major Swarovskis autumn-winter 2005-06 collection in Hong Kong on July 6.

 With the dress code reading crystal ice on the invitation, the crowd comprising local glitterati and media from Japan, Korea, Taiwan, China and Australia among others turned up in dazzling frost and ivory, with diamonds and crystals lending the required shimmer on necks, wrists and ears. The flowing, lacy gowns and dresses in dreamy white georgette and satin looked straight off the Hollywood red carpet.

 It was the Indian lot however, that decided to stick out with pinks, blacks and blues. They had company once the party animals started trickling in later at night in bright greens and orange, throwing the dress diktat to the wind.

 The new Swarovski collection called In the Mood for Ice evokes the snowy landscapes of the polar region and captures the changing hues of frosted ice. The exquisite lines of jewellery, accessories and home d?cor were launched with a fashion show and party at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre. 

 In tune with the theme of the collection, the venue was transformed into an ice land. Over 700 guests, dressed in crystal ice walked through a crack in the ice dome to enter the sprawling auditorium, and be greeted by flutes of champagne.

 Six large icebergs at the centre of the venue further added to the arctic feel. The pieces from the new collection were displayed all around. But for once, the brilliance of crystals seemed to dim a little in comparison with three giant ice sculptures ? of a polar bear, an iceberg and the Swarovski signature swan ? that stole the show.

 The no-frills and low-on-drama fashion show treated guests to the new line of necklaces, bracelets, earrings, rings and evening bags; the crystals combined with fur to lend a wintry feel. Seventeen top models from Hong Kong including Kathy Chow, Lisa S, Rosemary Vanderbrouke, Eunis Chan, Sofie R. and Balia Chan were dressed in simple well-cut minimalist outfits to highlight the Daniel Swarovski couture line and the Swarovski Fashion collection.

 The high point of the show, however, was saved for the final sequence, with Hong Kong-based actress Michelle Reis making an appearance on the ramp in a dazzling Daniel Swarovski crystal outfit. Studded with nearly 50,000 crystals, the first ever outfit from the Swarovski stable was tailor-made for Michelle.

 The show was followed by a high-voltage performance by a Korean band called Nanta. The five-member team put up a performance of traditional Korean percussion.

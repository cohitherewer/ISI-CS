The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Asok Bhattacharya

 Minister, Urban development and municipal affairs, government of West Bengal

 We have no plans to implement such a system. We want decentralisation of power. Division of labour always works well. It allows people to attend to their respective duties. The civic infrastructure has grown; the workload too has increased. Not just the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, the 100 or so municipalities in the districts also run under this system. Both the chairman-in-council and the mayor-in-council are doing well. We have not received any complaints. If the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation has abolished its mayoral council, that is its discretion.

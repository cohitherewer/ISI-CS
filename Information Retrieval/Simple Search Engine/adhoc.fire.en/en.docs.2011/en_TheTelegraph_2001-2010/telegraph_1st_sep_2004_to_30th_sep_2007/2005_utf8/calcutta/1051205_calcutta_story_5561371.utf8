The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Return to innocence

 From the absolutely adorable kid in Masoom to the cute boy next door in Papa Kehte Hain to the knight in shining armour in Mohabbatein, Jugal Hansraj has had many a sporadic inning in Bollywood. And the latest from the Shekhar Kapur discovery is a four-day small-screen stint in Darna Mana Hai, the new scary series on STAR One.

 ?I had seen the original film and found it very interesting,? Jugal tells Metro. ?So when the same producers came to me with the TV serial offer in an effort to carry forward the concept of the movie, I agreed immediately.?

 This is not the first time that Jugal will be seen in a TV serial. He was part of the star-studded cast of Karishma: The Miracle of Destiny. ?I no longer want to get into full-fledged roles on television, getting tied down for 20 days a month for a soap,? he explains. ?It?s not that doing TV is bad. The small screen is now a very big medium with a huge reach. As long as the work is good, I have no problem in doing something on television.?

 So this Monday to Thursday, every night at 10 pm on STAR One, you can catch Jugal in your drawing room in another eerie tale with a twist. ?It is about this young couple who has these spooky experiences. I play a writer who is going through a creative lull in his career. Now, things start going wrong as soon as he gets a new laptop. Lots of unexplained occurrences happen around him. In the end, of course, you come to know what exactly was the reason for those bizarre incidents.?

This particular Darna Mana Hai story is being directed by FTII graduate Rajen Khosa. ?He?s done a lot of short films in the UK which have made it to a lot of international festivals,? reveals Jugal. ?This is the first time he?s doing something in India and trust me, he?s really good.?

 A stint on the small screen doesn?t mean bye-bye to the big one. Just months back, Jugal did a delightful cameo in the Saif Ali Khan-Preity Zinta blockbuster Salaam Namaste. ?That was more of a friendly gesture,? explains Jugal. ?The film?s director, Siddharth Anand, is a friend and he always wanted me for that small role. And it was a delightful experience with a very young cast and crew. I have never had such a memorable time since my childhood days on the sets of Masoom. My schedule was for just seven days but I had a total blast.?

 But won?t we see Jugal in the lead again? ?I will be starting a film pretty soon with an all-new team and yes, I will be playing the romantic hero,? is all he is ready to divulge.

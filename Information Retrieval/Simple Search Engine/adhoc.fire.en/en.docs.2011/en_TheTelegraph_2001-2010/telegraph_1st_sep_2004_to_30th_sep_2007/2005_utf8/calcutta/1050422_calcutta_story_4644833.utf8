The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Airport gadgets to weather all storms

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 Clear skies one minute, thunderstorm the next.

 Abrupt changes in wind pattern, though nothing new to Calcutta, can prove costly for air traffic. With the city airport poised to emerge as one of the busiest hubs in Southeast Asia, efforts are on to ready it for weathering all storms and making flying in the region much safer. 

 Taking the lead is the airport?s meteorological department, which is undertaking a first-in-the-country study of the abstruse structure of thunderstorm clouds in the Calcutta skies. 

 ?Many people do not know that thunderstorms here are actually one of the severest in India, making upgrade of the early warning system more difficult,? said senior meteorologist Vivek Sinha.

 A special Doppler weather radar, worth over Rs 16 crore, has been installed atop the New Secretariat building for the project. The radar has a radius of over 500 km. 

 Also installed are a special storm detection radar, with a surveillance range of more than 450 km, and two other special instruments, Ceilometer (for studying cloud formation) and Vaisala Transmission Meter (for measuring runway visibility).

 ?Our job is to supply information round-the-clock to the Air Traffic Control about the weather conditions, including wind patterns, visibility or the possibility of a storm, if any. It has become urgent for us to update our knowledge, as well as the standards of the airport,? said A.K. Das, director (met department) at the airport.

 The meteorologists will use the feedback from the Doppler radar to study the micro sub-system inside thunderstorms. ?We will study the hail pattern, structure and height of thunderstorms in the city,? Sinha added. 

 Of late, pilots from various airlines have been reporting abrupt changes in wind pattern and velocity near the airport and sudden formation of cloud cover.

 ?Abrupt changes in the wind pattern or air density immediately after a flight takes off or while it is about to land can prove disastrous,? said senior meteorologist R. Dasgupta.

 Two weeks ago, unseasonal fog around the airport threw flight schedules haywire, prompting airport officials to scurry to Met experts for answers.

 Worse was in store on April 10, when a huge thunderstorm lashed the city, sending panic waves across airlines.

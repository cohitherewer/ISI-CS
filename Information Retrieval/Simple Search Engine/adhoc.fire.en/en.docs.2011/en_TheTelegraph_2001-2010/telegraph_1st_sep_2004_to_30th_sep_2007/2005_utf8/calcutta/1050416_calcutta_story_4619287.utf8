 Reckless bus kills woman

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Reckless driving claimed the life of a young woman and left a 24-year-old motorcycle rider critically injured in separate accidents on Friday. Another mishap killed a middle-aged man on Thursday night.

 Dipshikha Ghosh, 22, was killed when she fell off a CSTC bus on EM Bypass, in Kasba, around 9 am on Friday. The bus, on route S31, was headed for Garia.

 Police said Dipshikha, a resident of Regent Park, was waiting on the footboard to get off at the Kalikapur stop when the driver swerved. 

 The woman lost her balance and fell. The back of her head hit the kerb, killing her on the spot. The driver sped off, but later surrendered at Kasba police station. 

 Earlier in the day, around 7 am, Prakash Bhattacharya, 24, a resident of Paikpara, was critically injured when he rammed his motorcycle into a truck on Tallah Bridge.

 Police said a truck in front of Prakash suddenly swerved, trying to overtake another city-bound vehicle. Prakash by then had accelerated, and his two-wheeler hit the truck and skidded under it.

 The truck driver slammed the brakes immediately, but Prakash?s right leg went under the front wheel of the vehicle. He was admitted to RG Kar Hospital with multiple fractures.

 Late on Thursday, a truck driver was run over by a lorry on Jheel Road, Cossipore.

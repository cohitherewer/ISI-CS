The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Orchards to bring back birds

 SOMENATH MUKHERJEE, deputy conservator of forest (urban and recreational forestry), met readers of The Telegraph at his office on Thursday to answer their queries. Participants included Lalit Singh Nahar, G. Laha, Chandrima Ghosh, Sandip Banerjee, Diptimoy Ghosh, Jitendranath Das, Amit Roychowdhury and Soumya Ghosh

Soumya Ghosh: What are the functions of the urban and recreational forestry department?

 The forest department has several wings, one of them being urban and recreational forestry. The wing mainly operates within Calcutta and suburbs. Our principal responsibility is to maintain parks, including the Eden Gardens, Banabitan in Salt Lake and Gandhighat in Barrackpore. We also provide technical expertise to agencies like the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners, Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority and Public Works Department (PWD) to help them make their lands more green.

Jitendranath Das: Why aren?t you planting fruit trees like mango and guava in your gardens? Apart from providing oxygen and adding to the greenery, they will also help in generating employment.

 We have a plan to plant fruit trees in some of our gardens, although I am not sure that it will generate employment. If the trees can bring back some birds to the city, we would feel that our efforts have been amply rewarded.

 Plantation of fruit trees in open gardens has certain problems, but we will definitely try it out in our new garden on JL Nehru Road. We have plans to plant debdaru, mahogany, palm, mango and peepul in our garden. The trees will provide more oxygen to the already-polluted city environment.

Soumya Ghosh: Are you responsible for the maintenance of roadside trees?

 There is a common misconception that we are responsible for the trees planted along the roads. They are the property of the agency that maintains the stretch. For example, if a road is maintained by the PWD, it is also responsible for the trees on it, irrespective of who does the planting.

 Agencies which do not have experience in planting and maintaining trees, sometimes approach us for help in preservation and expansion of the greenery in their area.

Sandip Banerjee: If it is reported to you that trees are being cut or their branches chopped off, can you take action against the offenders?

 We are not the proper authority to look into such matters since the roads do not come under the jurisdiction of the forest department. There is no law that provides us the teeth to punish people for illegally felling trees. However, if the illegal felling occurs in the area under our jurisdiction, we can initiate action against the offenders.

 In accordance with a high court order, we had constituted a committee on unauthorised felling of trees and chopping of branches. Members of the Pollution Control Board are part of the committee. If someone wants to prune or fell a tree, he has to apply in writing to our utilisation division, which issues a clearance letter after a discussion among the committee members.

Amit Roychowdhury: The state government seems to be trying to generate income by utilising the department?s resources. Do you have plans to create more such resources?

 We have generated a considerable amount of revenue by utilising forest resources. The bulk of the amount is obtained by imposing entry fees in the various parks under our jurisdiction and selling forest products like honey and medicinal oils. Every outlet of our department stocks these products. People can also buy the products from our offices. Citronella oil, which is easily available at our outlets, is very popular as a herbal insect repellent. The oil is supplied by our North Bengal branch, which grows Citronella plant, from which the oil is extracted.

 Hail, the Elephant God

 The beauty of Indian cultural heritage lies in its abiding relevance even in modern times. Emphasising the everlasting charm of our countrys multi-faceted and holistic culture, the students of Pandit Sambhu Maharaj Kathak Academy and the Dhwani repertory group of New Delhi present dance-drama Ganesh. Choreographed by Vaswati Misra, the performance reflects how Indian culture and tradition are closely knit into our myths and legends. Performed by children above 6 years, who dance, sing and enact various roles, the composition tries to explain with childlike simplicity, why Lord Ganesh is worshipped at the beginning of every Hindu ceremony. Using both dialogue and humour to delve into issues pertaining to philosophy, religion and theology, this theatrical extravaganza, nevertheless, stays true to its aim of creating awareness of Indian culture in children?s minds. Thus, the lovable, pot-bellied Elephant God appears on stage, telling stories to children and reminding them of His constant presence in their lives.

 Event: Dance drama Ganesh, produced by Dhwani, New Delhi

 When: Today and tomorrow at 6 pm

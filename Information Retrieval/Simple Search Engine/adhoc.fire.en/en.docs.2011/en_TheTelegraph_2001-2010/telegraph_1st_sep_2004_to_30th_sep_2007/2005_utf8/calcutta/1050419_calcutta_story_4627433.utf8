 The century-old Tallah Jheel Park (Jatindra Mohan Park) is being given a massive makeover, courtesy funds from the Asian Development Bank. 

 The new-look park will be the first in the city to have an accessible island in the midst of a waterbody, spread across 20 bighas.

 The 120-bigha park is the largest of all maintained by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the second largest in the city, after Eden Gardens, which measures 133 bighas.

 Used daily by around 5,000 morning walkers, the park has a pagoda, a gymnasium, a swimming club, an anglers? corner and a special area for children. An enclosure is coming up for women joggers.

 The one-bigha island, which has not been accessible to visitors for the past 100 years, has been linked by a concrete bridge, built at a cost of Rs 10 lakh. The island, now being beautified, will be thrown open to the public by mayor Subrata Mukherjee by the first week of May.

 ?It has been my dream to include Tallah Park on the list of the city?s tourist hotspots. That?s why I have taken up a special beautification scheme with additional funds from the civic body,? Mukherjee said. The Manila-based Asian Development Bank has sanctioned Rs 50 lakh for the project.

 The mayor?s plan includes installation of a dome-shaped fountain on the island, setting up a hothouse for cacti and showcasing the ?treasures? of the locality, like the Tallah Tank. With a capacity of nine million gallons, the tank is the largest overhead reservoir in the country and a landmark in the city. 

 The nursery, apart from a rich collection of cacti, will have bonsai fruit plants and potted vegetable plants. 

 The nursery of the civic body?s parks and gardens wing is also located on the park compound.

 ?I?m sure visitors will be pleased to see over 50 kinds of bonsai trees, varieties of flowering cacti, and fruits like mango, chiku, lemon, star apple and black guava hanging from branches of dwarf trees grown in pots,? the mayor said.

 Local councillor Mala Saha said the park grounds, to the east of the Tallah pumping station, comprises over 80 per cent of the erstwhile ?Cossipore-Chitpore open space sub-division?. It is divided into three sectors ? Tallah Jheel Park (over 40 bighas), Tallah Park (over 50 bighas) and Tallah Circus ground (25 bighas).

 ?Ajit Panja had offered more than Rs 15 lakh from the MP?s local area development fund for the upkeep of the park, including its lighting, over the past eight years,? Saha pointed out. ?A thorough rejuvenation, however, is taking place for the first time in the past 50 years.? 

 She added that the island would have been lost to erosion if it were not linked with the park grounds. ?Had the bridge been constructed 10 years ago, the island would have been much bigger now.?

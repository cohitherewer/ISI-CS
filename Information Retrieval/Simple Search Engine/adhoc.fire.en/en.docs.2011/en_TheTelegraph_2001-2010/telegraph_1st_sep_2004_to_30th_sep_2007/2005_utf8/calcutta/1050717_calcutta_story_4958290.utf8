 French was the flavour at The Regency Ballroom of Hyatt Regency on July 14, a good 216 years after the storming of Bastille by the people of Paris. And fraternity was the favoured feeling as a turnout of over 2,000 guests mingled at the French National Day celebrations hosted by Mahendra Kumar Jalan, honorary consul of France in Calcutta.

 The party started sharp at seven in the evening when the consular staff, French dignitaries and city celebrities started trickling in.

 The National Day of France is celebrated worldwide with a lot of zeal and ceremony. It signifies the triumph of good over evil. It is one of the most awaited events on the French calendar, stresses a spokesperson for the consulate.

 The d?cor was based on French markets, with flowers and canopies adorning the venue. The covered area of the ballroom was decorated with flowers, while the open-air area was done up to mirror the look of a typical French market.

 White, blue and red ?colours of the French national flag ? dominated the d?cor. From bar counters to light arrangements, from carpets to the attire of the serving staff, these hues were seen everywhere.

 Several carts loaded with sumptuous French fare further enhanced the theme. The cart full of French bread varieties was a hit with the crowd, as was the dessert counter.

 The high point of the party, however, was the huge variety of wines served. Cotes du Rhone Blanc (white) and Rouge (red), Michel Laroche Merlot and Michel Laroche Chardonnay were among the most wanted.

 These were accompanied by a selection of French, Italian and Swiss cheese including Brie, Camembert, Boursan, Gorgonzola, Taleggio, Parmesan and Emmenthal.

 Those spotted at the party included Sharbari Dutta, Tanushree Shankar, June, P.K. Banerjee, Piu Sarkar, Shaun Kenworthy and wife Pinky and Arjun Chakra-borty with wife Nilanjana. 

 Singer Usha Uthup took to the stage briefly to croon her trademark I Love You Kolkata to much applause.

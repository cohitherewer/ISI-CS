 Widow left battered to death

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 A 48-year-old widow, Dipti D?Cruze, was found murdered at home in Patra Lane, in the Taltala police station area on Monday morning. 

 The body was discovered around 11 am, when her brother Subol Gomes arrived from Kalyani to get the keys to a medicine store that she used to run with his help.

 When repeated calls evoked no response, Subol called the neighbours, and then, with the help of the local police, broke into the first floor of the two-storeyed house to find Dipti?s body.

 Nothing was missing from Dipti?s house, and police are still groping for a motive behind the murder that has sent shock waves in the area. 

 Dipti had no domestic help. With her only son away, studying MBBS in Bangalore, Dipti lived all by herself. 

 This is the second murder of its kind in the city in the past fortnight. In the last case on April 18, an elderly couple, Tara Chand Banka and his wife Sharda, were found battered to death in their seven-floor apartment in Mansarovar building, on Camac Street. 

 Soon after news of Dipti?s murder reached the police headquarters, senior officers, including those from the detective department?s homicide wing, reached the spot. Late in the evening, Dipti?s house was sealed. 

 Officers said the body, draped in a sari, lay drenched in blood on her bed. The feet were touching the floor. 

 Her face was covered with a pillow, and blood had oozed out of several deep wounds on her body, including the back of her head, her forehead and even from behind her ears. 

 Widowed barely 11 months ago, Dipti was possibly killed late on Sunday. 

 According to preliminary investigations, the woman was beaten up repeatedly. 

 This accounted for the deep black bruises on her left eye, her shoulder and face. 

 She was gagged, as the cloth inside her mouth suggested. The assailants hit her with a sharp weapon on her head, leaving her dead.

 ?Neighbours told us that Dipti usually kept to herself, restricting her socialising to an exchange of pleasantries. So, it appears that those who visited her late at night were probably acquaintances,? said Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (central). 

 Before his death, her husband Anthony used to work in Saudi Arabia, while Dipti used to run the chemist?s shop ? Dipti Medical Stores, on SN Banerjee Road ? a few yards away from the house. 

 After her husband died, Dipti?s brother began to help her run the shop. 

 Her neighbours told police Dipti would open shop around 11 am and shut it by eight in the evening. She kept the keys to herself.

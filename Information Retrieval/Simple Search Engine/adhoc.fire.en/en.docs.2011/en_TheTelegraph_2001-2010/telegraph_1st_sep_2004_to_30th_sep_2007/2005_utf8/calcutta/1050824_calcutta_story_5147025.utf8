 Finance tips for budding managers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Mere coursework and classroom knowledge is not enough for the managers of tomorrow. 

 To provide students with hands-on training in industry standards, Indian Institute of Social Welfare and Business Management (IISWBM) has entered into a strategic alliance with Calcutta-based Vedika Software to make accounting software FACT a part of the IISWBM curriculum.

 ?Almost all our programmes have a finance component in them and training in FACT will add 15 per cent more value to the students,? said Ashoke K. Dutta, director of IISWBM.

 As per terms of the memorandum of understanding signed between the two, Vedika will provide internship opportunities on marketing projects to IISWBM students. 

 The top five students will also be offered placement in Vedika.

 ?The industry-academia model is the ultimate sustainable one,? asserted Arvind Agarwalla, CEO of Vedika Software. 

 ?When we recruit fresh MBAs, it takes us months to bring them up to speed. Such a scheme will save all recruiters the time and resources spent in that training,? he added.

 FACT Software International, a 100 per cent subsidiary of Vedika in Singapore, recently entered into a similar agreement with Singapore Management University, and has already recruited 19 interns from it.

 Globally, Vedika claims to have 15,000 licensed installations of FACT, of which 10,000 are in India and 2,500 in Singapore. 

 The company, with direct presence in six countries, is expecting revenues to grow by ?25 per cent? this year.

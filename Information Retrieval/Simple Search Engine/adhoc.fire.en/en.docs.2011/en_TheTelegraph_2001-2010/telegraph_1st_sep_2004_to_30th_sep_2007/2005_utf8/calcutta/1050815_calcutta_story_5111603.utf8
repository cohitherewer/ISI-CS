 If you thought trends are restricted to the world of fashion, its time to do a rethink. International trends in confectionery presentation was the theme at a workshop held by expert chef Shaun Kenworthy at the Flurys factory on Park Street recently.

 Organised by FICCI Ladies Organisation in association with Flurys, the bakery workshop was also attended by members of Ladies Business Forum.

 Shaun, executive chef of Flurys and a popular figure on the citys food street for some years now, showcased the latest technology and trends in presentation and variety in confectionery.

 We wanted to show people what goes behind whipping up cakes and pastries at a confectionery shop. We also took this opportunity to display the makeover given to the Flurys factory. We have introduced certain new technologies that I am very excited about, says Shaun.

 The factory ? divided into separate chocolate, cake and pastry sections ? is equipped with state-of-the-art machines.

 These include steam-injected deck ovens, steam-injected sheeting machines and a hydraulic spiral mixer. 

 There are bread-making mixers that can hold more than 200 kilos of dough. The factory has two walk-in refrigerators and one walk-in freezer.

 Street spice

 Slices of Shanghai in the heart of Calcutta ? thats what speciality restaurant Mainland China is attempting to recreate.

 Titled Shanghai Street Food Festival, the unique affair at the popular Gurusaday Road eatery till August 25 highlights the streetside fare of the Chinese province.

 Food from all provinces of China are well-known in India. But street food, which is the most authentic Chinese food, has never been popularised here, says Rajesh Dubey, director, food production, of Speciality Restaurants Pvt Ltd, which owns both the Mainland China and Oh! Calcutta brands.

 The cuisine dished out by big restaurants in Shanghai would not get a very good response in Calcutta. But the street food there is spicy and hence will certainly find favour with Calcuttans. We have not tried to customise the food to local taste, adds Dubey.

 The menu starts off with Shanghai Street Chicken Bao, Shanghai Street Barbecued Lamb and Skewered Chicken Wings.

 The main course includes Fried Fresh Water Prawns, Crabmeat Tofu, Rose Petal Prawns, Deep Fried Baby Squid with Chilli sauce and Lamb with Cumin Seeds. 

 The pocket pinch can be anything between Rs 140 and Rs 300. 

 Hilsa high

 Kewpies, the quaint Bengali-speciality restaurant tucked away in Elgin Lane, is celebrating Independence Day in quite a unique manner. A weeklong Ilish Festival will be flagged off on August 15, dishing out 20 different delicacies of the hilsa.

 d family recipe books as well as improvisations in the kitchen have helped cook up the sumptuous specialities.

 Labelled Ilish Bhuri Bhoj Thala, the feast offers an extensive a la carte menu as well as thala options. 

 I always host a food festival specially for Independence Day. Since the monsoons were delayed this year, the hilsa also appeared late in the market. So I decided to combine the two things, says restaurateur Rakhi Purnima Dasgupta. I have combined the essence of Bengal and Bangladesh as and when necessary. Every dish has been created by either a family member or a cook, she adds.

 l-time favourites like Ilish Bhaja, Ilish Bhape, Smoked Hilsa and Ilish Paturi battle newcomers like Ilish Dolon (vindaloo), Ilish Kaacha Jhol, Ilish Deemer Ambol, Shosha Ilish, Aachar Ilish, Ilish Pulao and Crumbed Hilsa on the menu. 

 Specialities on the Anglo-Indian front include Hilsa with Orange, Mint and Peppercorn and Hilsa Stew. 

 The dishes are priced between Rs 80 and Rs 150.

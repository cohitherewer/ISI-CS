 For a filmi fling

 A film festival party two days before the festival? Well, thats the surprise the British deputy high commission sprung on Tuesday evening when it organised a cocktail party at Roxy to celebrate the participation of UK at the 11th Calcutta Film Festival, starting Thursday.

 But it was much more than that as The Park night haunt filled up by 8 in the evening.

 With the party called Night de Moulin Rouge, it wasnt surprising that faded images of the Baz Luhrmann film starring Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor were playing on the screen behind DJ Shrey.

 Its not only about movies in the festival but the whole involvement of the UK in the world of cinema, said an excited Andrew Hall, the British deputy high commissioner, the host for the evening.

 We offer a great location, provide superior post-production facilities and we do make great movies, he baritoned.

 Two of those movies will be shown at the film festival ? the multiple-award-winning Hotel Rwanda and the critically acclaimed Enduring Love.

 While Calcuttans can catch Don Cheadles breathtaking performance in the first, they can get a sneak peek of the new James Bond in the second, as Daniel Craig heads the cast of Enduring Love along with Samantha Morton.

 While neither Don nor Daniel was present at Roxy, Manisha Koirala did drop in to make heads turn.

 The Bollywood actress, in town to shoot for Rituparno Ghoshs Khela, came in as a special guest of Hall and left after a quick exchange with the deputy high commissioner.

 Once the Manisha effect faded, it was all Tollywood calling with the likes of June, Koneenica and Locket having a real blast. Not to be left out were the men ?Anjan Dutt, Arindam Sil, Arjun Chakraborty, Saswata...

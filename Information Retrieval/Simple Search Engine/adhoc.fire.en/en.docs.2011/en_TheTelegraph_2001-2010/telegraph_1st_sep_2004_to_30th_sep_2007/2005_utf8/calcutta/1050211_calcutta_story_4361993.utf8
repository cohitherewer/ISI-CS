 The battle is big and the drama is high when the best names in whisky from across the globe clash for top honours. 

 Judged on the basis of performance over two years and narrowed down to the Super 40, the big-ticket winner is then picked by 75 judges around the world.

 The 2003 winner of this competition held by Whisky Magazine of UK was a blended scotch called Cutty Sark 25 Years Old.

 The limited edition product was launched in Calcutta on Wednesday night at a party hosted by Prince of Cal, the lounge bar of Sourav?s: The Food Pavilion.

 The venue off Park Street saw Calcutta?s beautiful people trooping in to raise a toast. Be it the ageless Rita and Kishore Bhimani or the glamorous newly-weds Jisshu and Nilanjanaa or Tollywood faces like Arindam Sil and Deboleena Dutta, the house was happening.

 With a live Filipino band belting out old English numbers to go with the scotch on the rocks, it was not long before the mood was set for a longish midweek night out. But lounging, not jiving, was the mood of the moment.

 Sinful sweets

 Ever seen candies that look like a pair of red lips? Ever thought of wearing a candy necklace to a party or sporting candy finger rings?

 Sounds way out, does it? Then just take home a zoo with teddies, crocodiles, rats and even snakes ? all edible! Sweet World, a chain that has popularised the concept of Pick ?? Mix candy shopping in the country opened its first outlet in the city on Tuesday.

Selling a wide range of delightful candies imported 

from across Europe, Sweet World housed on the ground floor of Enclave in Alipore 

is a rare treat for those with a sweet tooth.

 ?For us, getting the supplies without the candies melting or going bad is a logistical nightmare,? admits owner Vrinda Rajgharia, who introduced the chain in India with a flagship store in Mumbai in 2002.

 After Mumbai, Delhi, Pune, Bangalore, Chennai, Gurgaon and Noida, the time has now come for a store in Calcutta.

 While Sweet World is expecting sales to be on a comfortable 

high because of the innovative products, it?s the shopping experience and the 

service at the store that Rajgharia thinks will ensure the return of the customer. 

 ?The fun of this store is that you can mix and match your toffees, taking three of one and two of the other, instead of buying the same thing in large packs,? he explains.

 Selling at Rs 60 for 100 g of candy, this is a treat one can?t afford to miss.

Ethnic effect

 If people in the city are partying with a vengeance, can party dressing be far behind? Not at all, considering the number of boutiques dealing in partywear saris. The latest to dish out the variety is Kasturi on New Road in Alipore.

 Mansi Lakhotia, the self-taught designer who?s making her store debut with this cosy and well done-up outlet, specialises in saris ? from muted tones to bright shades. ?My forte is embroidery,? says Mansi.

 Her pop pick is the light sari with heavy blouse. ?The saris have work mostly in the pallu and the border but are otherwise plain. The blouses are well embellished and are bound to draw attention,? feels Mansi.

 Cosmetic jewellery, watches and bags that can be matched with the saris are also on sale. Imported from Hong Kong, these go well with the rest.

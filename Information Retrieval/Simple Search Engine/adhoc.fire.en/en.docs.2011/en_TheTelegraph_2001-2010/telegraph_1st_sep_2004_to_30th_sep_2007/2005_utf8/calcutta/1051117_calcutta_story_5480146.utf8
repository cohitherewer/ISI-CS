 Whats your style sign?

Let your individuality into your wardrobe, 

accessories and make-up kit and never let it go. Shradha Agarwal tells 

you how to create that signature look

 Bipashas white ensembles and kohl-lined 

eyes, Sushmitas chunky diamonds, Rekhas ornate ethnic drapes and the 

Shetty sisters shoulder-baring outfits have helped them create their signature 

styles 

Karisma Kapoor has worked on it, Bipasha Basu re-discovered 

it and Kareena Kapoor has mastered it. Signature style is very much a part of 

every glamour girls being.

 A quick recap ? Rekhas heavy-duty Kanjeevaram saris, Sushmita Sens outrageous diamonds and Shilpa Shettys outfits showing off well-toned shoulders.

 Star-studded it may sound, but signature style can be yours too. All there is to it is some trial and some error, more trial and more error, and then voila!

 Signature style, according to designer Manish Malhotra, is your only way to stand out. All the girls look like all the other girls. Why end up looking like glaring photo-copies when you can fuse in your individuality? asks the fashion guru.

 So, enter signature style ? style of, by and for you. Your signature is a combination of fashion trends and styles, accepted as per your professional demands, lifestyle and the image you want to portray, explains style consultant Sunipa Samadder. Quite a tall order that. 

 But developing your own look isnt as tough as it appears. All you need is one good, hard look at yourself in the mirror, identifying your strongest points, and really, half the job is done.

 Clothes call

 The most vital element of your external persona, clothes do indeed make a man, and maybe more so a woman. Signature styling in your wardrobe gives a great deal of flexibility and opportunity to hide your worst and flaunt your best.

 Study your body type very well before you zero down to your personal statement. Signature style recognises the attire that suits your workplace, time and mind, says Sunipa. According to her, any outfit can be used functionally, as an accessory or as an over-garment. How you use it makes it your own.

 Your signature style also speaks volumes about your personality, at least the one you want to project. Hence Kareenas sporty look and Bipashas sexy appeal.

 A great gauge for the personal statements of our Bollywood icons is their dress code at the numerous award functions they attend.

 You will invariably find the Shetty sisters in shoulder-baring ensembles and Sonali Bendre in chikankari by Abu Jani-Sandeep Khosla, Hrithik Roshan in an all-black suit and Fardeen Khan in a crisp white shirt. And yes, the occasional jhatka in the form of deviation is always welcome.

 Seeking your own style identity is fine, but you must also guard against the boredom bug, something that can slip in so easily. Draw the boundaries but be open to experimentation within them. If Bohemian is your style, dont get stuck in the skirt rut. Introduce boho elements in your tops or bags, offers designer Abhishek Dutta. 

 Add-on effect

 Remember the string of pearls that always graces Maharani Gayatri Devis neck? Yes, accessories are the best way to add that my touch. Start collecting something passionately. While it can be any accessory, it must go well with your overall look.

 So, explore the world of add-ons ? caps, shades, jewellery, wrist-bands, scarves, stoles, handbags or just any accessory. An astrologically lucky gem or your birthstone can also be used to make it the personal piece.

 Long beaded necklaces or chunky silver pieces also portray a certain kind of look. In case of jewellery, choose between the funky and the classic look and weave things around it.

 Footwear, too, could form a big part of your statement. Try wearing mojris with skirts and suits while everybody around you is strutting in heels.

 Face value

 According to make-up expert Ambika Pillai, developing your signature style in make-up is all about knowing your facial highlights and accentuating them. Also, it means doing it again, and again, till the world knows its yours.

 Signature is about looking unique, so its often a good idea to go in the opposite direction. Ditch the pink blush and stick with a bronzer all the time. Also, use lip brushes ? they make all the difference, adds Ambika.

 But that does not mean sticking to the same look for all seasons. Keeping an eye on the trends is equally important. Always know whats hot, but dont look like a copycat.

 So when the world is busy smoking their eyes out, smoke yours too, but with a difference. Add your own bit by using midnight blue mascara at the tip of the lashes. You can also smoke out with a deep purple to express your individuality, advises Ambika.

 If you dress Indian, incorporate a highly ethnic element like an elaborate bindi.

 For hair, Ambika suggests changing your style each season. The curls can go flat and the straight can go wavy. If the world is going blonde, but you know burgundy will suit you best, stick to it.

 Finally, dont forget your signature smell? pick your fragrance carefully and stay with it.

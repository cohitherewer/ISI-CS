The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Khushnud Khan

 Distributor, Nikita Films 

 Of course. It?s more than two years now that multiplexes have arrived in the city. And look at the number of halls that have closed down ? Metro, Orient, Globe, Lighthouse, New Cinema... True some had staff problems as well, but the root was usually a fall in business. From our point of view, single-screen theatres are more profitable. They charge a fixed house rent whereas the multiplexes charge a hefty percentage of the collections. For instance, in a hall like Paradise, we have to pay Rs 1.25 lakh for the first week. If the film does a business of Rs 10 lakh, we can take home 8.75 lakh. In a multiplex, they will take away Rs 5 lakh. Things will improve only when there are 10-15 multiplexes. By then, many of us will be finished.

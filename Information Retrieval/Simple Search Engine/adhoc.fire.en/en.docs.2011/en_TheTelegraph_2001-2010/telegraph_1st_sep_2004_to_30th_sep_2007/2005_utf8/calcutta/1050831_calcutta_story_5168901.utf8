The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Over the years, the population in Baguiati and Aswininagar has increased manifold. Shoppers from Aswininagar regularly visit Baguiati bazar nowadays. The constant flow of vehicular traffic on VIP Road makes it very difficult for these people to cross over. Subways at regular intervals along the thoroughfare, especially at the VIP Road-Baguiati crossing, will be of much use. It is only during a certain part of the day that a few home guards are deployed to regulate traffic at the smaller intersections on VIP Road.

 B.N. Bose,

 Dum Dum Park. 

 A few doctors in south Calcutta are taking desperate patients for a ride. One such ?reputed? dentist at Deshapriya Park told me that it would cost at least a few thousand rupees for a complete denture. On the other hand, a doctor on Bentinck Street charged a very nominal fee, and yet, did a remarkable job. 

 Vijay Jain, 

 Nundy Street. 

 While passing through the stretch between Mayo Road and Akashvani Bhavan a few weeks ago I noticed that the halogen street lights were not working. Also, the railings bordering the new park on Jawaharlal Nehru Road is being used as a clothesline. How can the authorities let a prime urban landscape resemble a dirty backyard?

 Chandan Ray,

 Sakuntala Park. 

 Nearly 20,000 people living in Bankimnagar, in Nadia district, depend on a local health clinic which is bereft of even the basic amenities that a health centre should have. When local people approach the medical centre for treatment for snake or dog bite, the anti-venom and anti-rabies injections are not available here. I request the state health minister to upgrade this health centre at the earliest.

 Prahlad Agarwala,

 Majdia, Nadia. 

 At around 8 am, the Sarat Bose Road-Rowland Road-Elgin Road crossing is usually congested. When I was passing through the area recently, I noticed that vehicles from all directions were trying to move at the same time while the traffic light was amber. No traffic policemen could be seen at the time. What is the use of a traffic signal if it is not effective in controlling the movement of vehicles? At this particular crossing, the traffic lights should be pre-programmed to change every two minutes in the morning till the traffic cops take over.

 S.S. Almal,

 Lower Rawdon Street.

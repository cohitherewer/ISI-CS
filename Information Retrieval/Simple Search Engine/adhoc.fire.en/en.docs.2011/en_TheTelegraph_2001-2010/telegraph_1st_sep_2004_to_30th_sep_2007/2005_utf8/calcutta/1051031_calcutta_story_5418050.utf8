The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Landfill behind waterlogging 

 DIPU DAS, CPM councillor of ward 67, met the readers of The Telegraph in her Swinhoe Lane office to answer their queries. Participants included Himangshu Mukherjee, Sujata Roy, Chotu Chowdhury, Sandip Banerjee, Mrinal Roy, Samarendra Das, Rajkumar Singh, Anjana Adhikary, Bijoy Biswas and Premlal Das

Mrinal Roy: In several pockets in the ward ? Dharmatala Road, KN Sen Road and Swinhoe Lane, for example ? rainwater remains stagnant for several days.

 The problem is that there is no place to drain the stagnant water. The population is increasing at an alarming rate, while the waterbodies are being filled up illegally. The situation would not have reached this state had the existing drains and sewers been cleaned regularly over the past five years.

Sujata Roy: The Chowbhanga- Picnic Garden-Kasba-Tiljala-Kustia belt has immense economic potential, especially after the commissioning of the Bondel Gate flyover. What is the state government and the civic body doing to develop the zone?

 We are planning to widen Picnic Garden Road so that it can cope with the heavy flow of EM Bypass-bound traffic. I have started discussions with the district traffic police for the installation of signals, at least yellow dippers, at some busy intersections.

Himangshu Mukherjee: What is the status of the Picnic Park development scheme? The owner of the 56-cottah plot handed it over to the state sports council in 2003. I have heard that legislator Rabin Deb and former MP Biplab Dasgupta had allotted funds for the project.

 You probably know that a local club had tried to sell the land. The attempt was foiled by the Ballygunge Development Committee and Picnic Park Ground Development Committee.

 So far, Rs 9 lakh has been allotted for the development of Picnic Park. The work will start by November. A tent for volleyball and cricket coaching, a joggers? track and a gymnasium will be constructed.

Samarendra Das: In comparison to the adjacent areas, ward 67 is grossly underdeveloped. It is also thickly populated. Why don?t you urge the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) to sanction more money for the development of the ward? 

 It is a good proposal. In fact, the civic board is toying with the idea of considering the development status of a ward and its population while allocating funds for development. More than 43,000 people live in ward 67, while a neighbouring ward has a population of only 18,000. Wards with large population need more resources to provide proper civic service.

Rajkumar Singh: Forty per cent of the population in ward 67 lives in slums. What measures are you considering to improve the civic amenities in slums?

 Slum development had been put on the back burner by the last civic board. My predecessor had wanted to set up 85 toilets in the slums in my ward, but was thwarted by the board. I have so far arranged for Rs 53 lakh to develop the slums in Swinhoe Lane. The work will start after Kali puja.

Anjana Adhikary: Over the past few years, the 42 health workers in your ward had to do without medicines supplied by the CMC health department. Can you help them obtain more medicines?

 I am aware that the health workers were not getting adequate medicines for distribution among the poor. The situation has improved after I took charge. The shortage was man-made.

Bijoy Biswas: Kasba market, the largest in the area, is in bad shape. Why isn?t the CMC coming up with a comprehensive plan for its development?

 The condition of the market needs to be improved immediately. A development proposal is presently being discussed.

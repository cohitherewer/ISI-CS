 A major accident was averted on Friday afternoon when a private bus smashed through the railings of the bridge connecting the Ultadanga crossing with VIP Road, teetered in mid-air with no ground under its two front wheels, but ultimately came to a halt.

 However, a man standing under the bridge received serious injuries when a small piece of concrete fell on him.

 After conducting a preliminary investigation, police said the bus hit the railings when the driver lost control of the vehicle. ?It happened because the brakes failed,? said Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner (headquarters).

 Panicky passengers jumped out through the rear door of the bus. However, no one was reported injured. The bus was hauled away after one-and-a-half hours.

 According to police, the accident occurred around 3.40 pm when the bus, coming from Lake Town and heading towards Ultadanga, hit the bridge. ?When the bus reached the bridge, passengers felt a mild jerk. Suddenly, the vehicle veered to the left, and I heard the noise of a collision,? said a constable posted at the Ultadanga crossing. A 10-ft stretch of the railing was smashed,? police said.

 As policemen and local people rushed towards the bus, the two front wheels were suspended in mid-air. ?Passengers were screaming and some started jumping off the vehicle through the rear door,? said the officer.

 Police helped the commuters get down. The driver managed to flee. By then, police had learnt about the injury to the pedestrian who was walking down the road along Kestopur canal. He was admitted to RG Kar Hospital.

 The bus hung out of the bridge for over an hour. Around 4.30 pm, a crane was pressed into service to haul the vehicle. ?It took more than half-an-hour, as the vehicle had badly damaged the railing. Around 5 pm, the bus was removed from the spot,? said deputy commissioner Sharma. 

 Traffic on the eastern flank of VIP Road was thrown out of gear. ?A section of the bridge was completely blocked. So, there was a jam right up to Lake Town, Ultadanga-EM Bypass crossing and Kankurgachhi. Traffic movement eased only after the bus was removed,? said an officer of the traffic department.

 Daring to dream

 History, being mainly concerned with recording the reigns, campaigns and exploits of great warriors, kings and statesmen, falls sadly short of narrating the day-to-day struggles for survival of the common man. Literature, on the other hand, looks upon ordinary men and women with understanding and sympathy, trying to find for them an independent social identity. Kalyani Natyacharcha Kendra?s stage adaptation of Akhtaruzzaman Elias? Khowabnama (The Dream Narrative) is thus an attempt to uncover the courageous life stories of common people, who bravely rose up in revolt against years of exploitation and abuse. With its plot based on the struggles of poor, landless labourers during the Tebhaga movement, the play shows how even the weakest amongst us can reshape our own destinies if our intentions are honest and if only we dare to dream. Offering a positive view of life, Khowabnama provides a fresh understanding of human and community power in a manner that is unflinchingly realistic.

 Event: Play in Bengali, Khowabnama, produced by Kalyani Natyacharcha Kendra

 When: Today at 6.30 pm

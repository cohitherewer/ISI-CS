The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Taking the stage alone, with message of love

 SUDESHNA BANERJEE

 He came to Mumbai from Raipur at 18 to become a music director in Bollywood, shifted to ghazal and bhajan-singing and is now known to city and village alike as the face and voice of Vivekananda, Sant Kabir and Tulsidas. Sekhar Sen believes in destiny. 

 Sipping tea back at the hotel two hours after bringing the saint-reformer of Bengal alive on stage at The Heritage School, the actor, who has made the mono-act his vehicle, points out that the characters whose lives he stages, have all preached messages of universal brotherhood. 

 ?Yet when I started out in 1998, the Ram janambhumi controversy was on the boil and I got branded as a fundamentalist.? Sen is a polyglot, fluent in Bhojpuri, Awadhi, Bundelkhandi, Brijbhasha and Bengali. Yet his vehicle is Hindi as this, in his words, ?is the language I dream in?.

 ?As it is, people dislike paying to watch Hindi theatre as they compare the entertainment to films and TV serials. Choosing a spiritual subject is karele pe neem charana.? A matchbox-size advertisement in a vernacular daily cost so much. Add to that the charge of hiring an auditorium, props and paying the technicians. ?The first few months we sold tickets worth some Rs 3,000 for Tulsidas. It was like ghar phuk ke tamasha dekhna,? he reflects. The day the collection reached Rs 10,000, the Sens distributed sweets.

 Since then he has crisscrossed the country with his productions. Statistics show Kabir to be the most popular, having crossed 200 stagings (Vivekananda though is going strong with 67 appearances in 58 weeks). Though the city performances pay for his keep, it is the makeshift village stage, lit by generator lights, that pulls him more. He fondly recalls a Tulsidas show by the Sarayu river in Ayodhya. ?For as far as the eye could see, there were bullockcarts with farmers who had lit fires to keep themselves warm.? After another show in Rouza village, Uttar Pradesh, an aged man had counselled him: ?Yee jo tohra natak hai na, iss ko tu gaon gaon mein le ja.?

 One of the pains of performing in the city is the intrusion of the cellphone ring. ?From Hong Kong and the US to Calcutta and Mumbai, it is an international problem. If you have seen me lose my temper on stage, it is because I think Vivekananda himself would have done the same.?

 The break in concentration is all the more serious as Sen takes the stage alone. ?Even when there are no shows I have to rehearse daily so that the timing is perfect and I retain the stamina to sing in between dialogues. Kabir, for instance, has 38 characters and 45 songs in 35 ragas. Singers like Anuradha Paudwal and Sonu Nigam ask me how I manage to sing while weeping. It demands practice,? Sen smiles. 

 Sen has refused offers to televise his two-hour mono-acts. ?A TV show does not have the impact of a play. If even one person in the audience starts believing in the preachings of these saints, my job is done.?

 This decision has its flip side. Since video-recording is banned, one person has never seen his show. He is Sekhar Sen.

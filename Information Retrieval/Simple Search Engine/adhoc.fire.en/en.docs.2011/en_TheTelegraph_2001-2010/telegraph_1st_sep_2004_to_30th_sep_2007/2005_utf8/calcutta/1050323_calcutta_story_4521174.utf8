The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Films and flannels bridge the great divide

Two young people from Pakistan were in town to watch 

the showdown at Eden Gardens. But as Pratim D. Gupta found out, movie magic 

more than cricket craze defined their view from beyond the border

(From top) Mridu Chandra and Rehan Ansari, 

Shah Rukh Khan and Preity Zinta in Veer-Zaara, a moment from Lakshya, 

and Pakistani actress Meera with Mahesh Bhatt 

What do you mean by you people?? the question came 

in a duet. ?You people? ? the only two loose words spoken in the hourlong chat 

with Rehan and Mridu. The clarification: ?You people as in the people outside 

India.? The two calmed down instantly.

Rehan Ansari and Mridu Chandra were two of the many 

Pakistani nationals who had come down to Calcutta to watch Inzamam?s men take 

on Sourav?s boys. But a cursory glance at their work profiles and you would know 

that their interests lay beyond the 22 yards.

While Rehan is the former editor of Independent Press 

Association, New York, a visiting lecturer at New School University in New York 

and an aspiring film-maker, Mridu is a film-maker, producer, researcher and lecturer 

all rolled into one. After studying the intersection of sexuality and politics 

in South Asia at the University of Chicago, Mridu went on to make award-winning 

documentaries like American Socrates: The Life of Bayard Rustin and the 

recent Let the Church Say Amen.

?We used the Test match as an excuse to come to Calcutta,? 

said Rehan. ?We had been to Delhi and Mumbai so many times in the last 10 years 

but have never been to Calcutta. So we had to make it this time.? Which they did 

after almost missing the train from Delhi. ?Rehan kept it for the very last moment 

and we almost missed the Rajdhani,? complained Mridu.

Once in Calcutta, the two have been on the move. ?We 

insisted on walking rather than taking the local transport. You don?t get the 

opportunity to walk in the Pakistani cities and even in Mumbai and Delhi. But 

here, we could walk long and hard, perhaps more than the people do here,? smiled 

Rehan.

The topic inevitably veered to the movies. ?I saw 

Page 3 and although I hated the pacing and the script ? there wasn?t much 

apart from the Hi and Hello ? I liked the ending,? gushed Mridu. ?I was planning 

to walk out in the middle of the movie but I decided to stay back and thank God 

I did that ?cause it really got interesting in the end.?

Rehan agreed. ?I am really happy that a film like 

Page 3 worked in India. My sister, an actress, watched the film and has 

shifted base to Mumbai. She told me, ?I would like to work in meaningful Indian 

films like Page 3.? You know what, films like these are not even attempted 

in our Lollywood. No wonder so many of our actors are trying their luck here in 

Bollywood. I think, even Shaan (who appeared in the Fuzon music video Mora 

saiyaan) should come here. He should be a huge hit.? 

But what about Meera and her kiss ki kissa? 

?You know what she said after the controversy? She said, ?Have you seen the Pakistani 

films in the last few years?? If you see those films, you would know they are 

all so racy. So why complain over a kiss?? laughed Rehan.

?That?s not the thing, Rehan,? argued Mridu. ?When 

you dance and all in those skimpy clothes, it?s ok. But a kiss is a kiss. You 

know it all becomes so different, when it comes down to a kiss.? 

Trying their best to forget the fifth day?s play at 

Eden, Rehan and Mridu enquired about Born Into Brothels. ?We took our film, 

Let the Church? to Sundance, but Born Into Brothels swept all the 

awards there. I haven?t yet been able to see the film since we didn?t have tickets 

beforehand and the film was sold out there,? said Mridu.

While Mridu goes out and makes her own documentaries, 

when it comes to feature films, she prefers producing them. ?May be some day I 

will be creatively involved with a fiction project, too. I am working on a script. 

Let?s see what evolves at the end of it all. At the moment, I am excited about 

teaching video production at Beaconhouse National University in Lahore. It is 

the first such school for liberal arts and more and more students are learning 

every aspect of digital video production and getting jobs straightaway in Pakistani 

television channels.?

With familiarity inching towards friendship, one couldn?t 

help asking the two about Pakistan?s view of hate and friendship films made in 

Bollywood. ?When it?s directly against us ? films like LOC Kargil and Lakshya 

? even the video parlours don?t want to keep them. Then again, some years back, 

JP Datta?s Border did very well there, perhaps because the people loved 

some star or the music of the film. But for a so-called friendship film like Veer-Zaara, 

the Pakistani people would go and watch it just because of Shah Rukh Khan, not 

because of the message in the movie,? revealed Rehan.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Apart from regular roads, garbage trucks often move on roads where their entry is barred. As the garbage is not covered properly with polythene sheets, a part of it falls off the vehicles and litters the entire stretch. Also, people in other vehicles that pass by are forced to face the unbearable stink and dust in the air. Aren?t garbage trucks banned from plying on city roads during the day? With a new civic board at the helm, can we expect at lease a few things to change for the better? A collective effort by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the city police can help curb the menace. Most of the drivers and helpers of these garbage trucks seldom give a thought for traffic rules. But these vehicles are never booked for jumping a red light or for overtaking from the left side.

 Sumant Poddar,

 Kyd Street. 

 Over the years, the VIP Road and Eastern Metropolitan Bypass have witnessed a steady rise in vehicular traffic. Now, the pressure is even more with the rapid development of Saltlec and Rajarhat New Town. As a result, the roads are wearing out even faster. Potholes have appeared on many spots. The authorities must be vigilant and take up repairs promptly on the thoroughfares.

 B.N. Bose, 

 Dum Dum Park. 

 A fresh coat of paint and a posse of policemen are not sufficient to denote the importance of Writers? Buildings. With a plaque reading ?heritage tag? to boot, the structure surely deserves more attention. But when one comes upon the filth right outside the building ? betel stains on the exterior walls, garbage dumped by the roadside eateries and the putrefying stink of urine ? all the grandeur of the state government?s seat of power seems hollow. If the current trend goes unchecked, the heritage buildings will soon reduce to ruins. The general public is equally responsible for preserving these heritage sites.

 Subhanjan Sengupta,

 Belur.

 Ichhapur railway station is an important stop under the Sealdah division. As the overbridge here is damaged, commuters trek across the railway tracks risking their lives. The railway should immediately repair the overbridge.

 Prahlad Agarwala,

 Majdia, Nadia.

 The area surrounding Mukundapur bus depot is being used as an open-air toilet. This, despite construction of a toilet at the depot. I would request the local administration to take stern action to stop the nuisance.

 Sukumar Ghosh,

 Mukundapur.

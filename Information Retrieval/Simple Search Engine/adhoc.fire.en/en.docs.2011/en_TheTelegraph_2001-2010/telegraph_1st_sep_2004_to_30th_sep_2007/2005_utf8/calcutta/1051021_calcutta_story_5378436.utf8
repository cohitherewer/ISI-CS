 Research for undergrads

 - JU agenda to satisfy demands of modern study system

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Academic activities of Jadavpur University (JU) students will no longer be confined to classroom studies and examinations. Participation in research activities will soon become imperative for undergraduate students of the institution.

 The decision is significant, as in most universities, students can participate in research projects only after graduation.

 ?It is a unique scheme and ours is possibly the first university in the entire country to introduce this,? said Rajat Bandyopadhyay, university registrar.

 The proposal was tabled at the meeting of JU?s finance committee on Wednesday, at which members unanimously decided to accept the policy and start making budgetary allocations for the purpose from the 2006-07 financial year.

 ?In the changing times, students need to start in-depth studies in their chosen areas from an early stage. The present move of the university, to engage them in research work, is aimed at enabling them to satisfy the demands of the modern education system,? said Partha Pratim Biswas, a senior teacher and member of the executive council.

 With the students? movements that rocked the university this year still fresh in mind, the finance committee, in addition to the provision for students? participation in research, has included a string of other schemes for them in its 2006-07 budget allocation.

 A two-and-a-half-month-long programme of examination and class boycott by students of the engineering faculty against examination reforms had prompted Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s government to deploy police and forcibly break a fast-unto-death in a late-night operation. A recent agitation against poor hostel facilities had crippled academic activities at the university, declared a centre of excellence and an institution of national importance.

 ?Our budgetary policies for the 2006-07 fiscal include a number of schemes to provide better facilities for students in classrooms, libraries and laboratories,? an officer said. A substantial portion of the funds provided to us by the Centre will be utilised for upgrading the classrooms, libraries and laboratories,? an official said.

 Besides, the university will allot a huge sum next year to improve students? hostels, particularly the one for women.

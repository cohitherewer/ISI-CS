 Heritage houses to shooting stars, biscuits to jewellery mdash; Calcutta is the place to be when it comes to an ad shoot

 Bhaichung Bhutia running through the streets of Calcutta, either with the football glued to his feet or engaging in a passing bout with fellow citizens...

 Well, thats the storyboard of a new commercial for Anmol biscuits. What makes it special is that the ad film is being shot by Prahlad Kakkar.

 The maverick adman came down to Calcutta on Monday to capture Bhaichung in action everywhere from Howrah bridge to old houses at Rashbehari.

 Calcutta has in the past year become the hub of ad-film-making activity with everyone from Kakkar to Pradeep Sarkar to Shoojit Sircar, and every agency from Genesis to Red Ice to White Light, flying in to can the action in the city ? high on heritage locations and low on the cost factor.

 The ad action has hotted up this past week with Hyundai, Tanishq, Philips, and Thums Up jumping on to the bandwagon. 

 Ad films for ICICI and Sonata are all set to be shot here sooner rather than later.

 So what makes Calcutta such a hot favourite with ad agencies and ad film-makers? 

 Says Kakkar, a celebrity in his own right: The city has a character of its own which cannot be replicated in Mumbai, howsoever you try. We have always tried to recreate Calcutta in the sets of Mumbai but you only get the flavour when you turn the camera on in the real city. And although the recent rains have made Mumbai quite groggy, it still cant become Calcutta.

 The upcoming Durga puja season is another time of the year where the stream of ad films flows towards this part of the world.

 Says Shoojit Sircar, who will shoot a Coca Cola ad in the city during the Pujas: The locations take a different tone altogether on festive occasions like Durga puja. Also, if you want to shoot a period ad film, Calcutta is the place with old buildings and streets. And recently, there has been such a lot of commercial interest in the city that it makes sense to shoot ads there.

 Add to that the presence of big sporting stars like Bhaichung and Sourav Ganguly, and you know why the city is firmly in the ad radar.

 The production costs in Calcutta are far less than Mumbai, adds Kakkar, who comes down often for the Emami ads.

 Where we lose out on is the TBL (travel, boarding and lodging) costs. So what we do is come with a very small team, usually the core team, and then take lots of local production people. The industry here is decent enough. You just have to get used to working at their rhythm and pace.

 That, to put it politely, means slowing down a few gears from the Mumbai pace.

 Sometimes, the product merges perfectly with the look and feel of the city. Says Robin Saha of White Light Films: We shot the Tanishq ad in Calcutta and we needed the city as the backdrop for our jewellery collection. So, mostly, it is the script that dictates the location of the ad film to be shot and we plan accordingly.

 Whatever be the reason or the season, Calcutta is certainly a centre of attraction for the mad ad world.

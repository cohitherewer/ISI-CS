The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Oscar library stocks Bolly

 Saif and Preity in a moment from Salaam Namaste

 For all those who pooh-poohed the script of Salaam Namaste as a copy-paste job of the Hugh Grant-Julianne Moore romantic comedy Nine Months, here?s something to chew on. The Oscar library, better known as the Margaret Herrick Library, has invited the Siddharth Raj Anand script to be part of its collection.

 ?It?s a slap on the faces of all those people who wrote off Salaam Namaste as a Hollywood rip-off,? the 27-year-old writer-director tells Metro. ?With the Academy itself inviting the film, there is now an authentication of the originality of the script. I am very happy with the invitation.?

 Just a month ago, the script of Parineeta, adapted from the Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay classic by director Pradeep Sarkar and producer Vidhu Vinod Chopra, was also selected by the Oscar library for to be added to the permanent script collection. This collection is only available for research to actors, students, film-makers and writers, who are part of the regular patrons of the library. Even circulation of the script outside the library premises is not permitted.

 Other Indian film scripts to have made it to the hallowed movie library include Guru Dutt?s Sahib, Bibi Aur Ghulam (1962), Ashutosh Gowariker?s Lagaan (2001) and Swades (2004), Nikhil Advani?s Kal Ho Naa Ho (2005) and Leena Yadav?s Shabd (2005). The library of the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences also houses some of Satyajit Ray?s published scripts like Shatranj Ke Khiladi and Sadgati.

 It was the Oscar nomination of Gowariker?s Lagaan that opened Bollywood doors to the West in a big way and invitations to the library have now become a regular feature.

 Meanwhile, at the box-office, Salaam Namaste has built on the great opening and is setting new records in the overseas territories apart from doing extremely well in the domestic market. It is on its way to becoming the biggest solo hit of Saif Ali Khan, surpassing the 2005 blockbuster Hum Tum, also from the Yash Raj banner.

 The figures say it all. At the UK box-office, Salaam Namaste has garnered US$ 934,200 till date, US$ 1.08 million in USA and Canada, US$ 350,000 in UAE and US$ 241,000 in Australia (the highest ever). All that takes the total overseas gross in just two weeks to US$ 3.06 million or Rs 13.5 crore. Salaam Namaste has already raked in Rs 17.5 crore from the Indian box-office and is still going strong.

 Siddharth, of course, is well into his next script, which he calls ?a serious romantic film?, that should take him at least another two months to finish. ?I haven?t thought of the casting at all except the fact that it?s going to be Saif again,? he reveals. Playing Saif, mate?

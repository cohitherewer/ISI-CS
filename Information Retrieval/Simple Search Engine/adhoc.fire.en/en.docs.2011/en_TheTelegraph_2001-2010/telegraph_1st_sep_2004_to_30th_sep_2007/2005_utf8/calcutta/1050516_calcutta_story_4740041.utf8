 Restobar route

 Year 1942: 

 Amber, one of the best known restaurants in the city till date on Waterloo Street, was launched. The 450-seater eatery, spread over three floors, has served delicious kebabs, fried fish and a host of lip-smacking Indian and Continental dishes for decades now and has become the weekend haunt of many a loyal customer. 

 The food, service, decor and ambience has remained more or less the same over the years. Nostalgia plays an important part in this food point as people come back wanting the same fare served in pretty much the same style. 

 Cut to 2005: 

 Soft remixes play in the background as you walk into a chic second floor hangout with bright orange walls, diffused lighting, window blinds and a welcoming bar. 

 Finally breaking out of age-old tradition, the restaurant is gearing up for the times ahead. The result is Essence, a 105-seater restobar done up in a contemporary style with an effort to address the changing needs of todays customer who doesnt mind paying extra to get that special ambience and service. 

 The second floor was lying vacant and we wanted to add some more seating. While working on the interiors we got the idea of a restobar, says director Sanjay Khullar. 

 Indeed, Khullar has taken pains to ensure that the d?cor suits the concept of a happy and vibrant outlet that they wanted it to be. The silver front of the bar coupled with black marble, bar stools and a glass background does well to jazz up the place. The comfortable seating and minimalist tables add to the casual chic, and yellow and red lights reflecting on orange and white walls create a dreamy effect. 

 While retaining its core competency in serving Indian and Continental food, Amber has now expanded its repertoire to include pre-plated meals and special kebab platters. One can wash it all down with refreshing cocktails, so far absent from the alcohol menu here. 

 We are projecting the place as a chill-out zone where people can enjoy their food and drink in a relaxed fashion and then move over to the discos in Park Street for some spirited jiving. We wouldnt encourage DJ music and dancing at this place, but special events are on the cards, adds Khullar.

 College tie-up for honing IT skills

 A STAFF REPORTER

 With benefits of the business process outsourcing (BPO) boom trickling to the state and employment opportunities multiplying, St Xavier?s College, in association with Technable Solutions Pvt Ltd, has decided to expand the scope of its training programmes for job aspirants in the IT-enabled services (ITES) industry.

 ?We do not believe in only awarding degrees. Our aim is to make the students better human beings and empower them with the skills to earn a living for themselves. The training initiative is geared towards making students employable,? said P.C. Matthew, principal, St Xavier?s College. 

 The premier institution, along with Technable Solutions, has been offering a number of training programmes in the institute for the past one-and-a-half years. 

 But now the St Xavier?s ? Technable ITeS Academy has decided to scale up the scope of the programme by including a host of new training modules and expanding to new geographical territories. 

 The partners have already signed an MoU to meet the objective. 

 ?It is an established fact that the BPO industry is facing human resource constraint. Estimates suggest that of 200 applicants, only six to eight sail through the interviews. Our effort is to empower the students to apply for the jobs,? said Sunny Bhattacharjee, director, St Xavier?s ? Technable ITeS Academy. 

 The offerings include conversational English, personality development, communication skills, soft skills, interview fitness, job-oriented domain skills required in call centres and non-voice BPOs.

 Technable Solutions recently tied up with Calcutta University to kick off training programmes for job aspirants in the BPO industry. 

 ?But the tie-up with St Xavier?s College is a bit different as we have plans to use the St Xavier?s ? Technable ITeS Academy brand name and set up institutes beyond the city,? added Bhattacharjee. 

 The expansion route will include setting up of the academy?s own training centres, franchising training programmes and collaborating with third parties for procurement of material and methodologies for augmenting the institute?s training offerings. 

 ?This is a welcome initiative as it will remove the bottlenecks in training in our state,? said G.D. Gautama, principal secretary, IT.

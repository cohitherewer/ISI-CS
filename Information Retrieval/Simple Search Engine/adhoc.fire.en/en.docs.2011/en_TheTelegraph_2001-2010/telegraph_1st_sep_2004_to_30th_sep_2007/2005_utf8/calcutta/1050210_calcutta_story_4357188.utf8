 Life has to move on after Black: Bachchan 

 quot;Hi, this is Amitabh quot;

 It takes a couple of seconds to sink in that you have received the most important phone call in your life. Within two days of penning a personalised Black tribute to ?the star of the millennium?, to actually have the legend call up and chat at length about being Devraj Sahay and more, bordered on the surreal. But before you can bask in the realisation of being at the other end of the line to the baritone (less deep on the phone than on screen), you remember you have a job at hand and questions to ask?

 Here?s Pratim D. Gupta in conversation with Amitabh Bachchan, within days of being bowled over by the magic of the man ? yet again ? in Sanjay Leela Bhansali?s Black.

 You have gone on record saying that Bhansali is 

the one director you would have loved to debut with and have even labelled him 

the future of Indian cinema. What is so special about him?

 I have always admired his work in Khamoshi, Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam and Devdas. There is a very particular style and stamp of his in all his films. And to make Black after the colourful and grand Devdas is a great departure. That?s a sign of a genius. I loved the script of Black and agreed to do it. His scripting is so good. I have always told Sanjay that he is a better writer than a director.

You learnt sign language for the film. Have you 

done something like this for any of your previous films?

 No, I have not done something like this at all. We (the rest of the cast) learnt the language of communication and also met up with physically challenged children. And it has been a very rewarding experience. We could have done without learning the language. There was always an expert on the sets to help us out. But Sanjay wanted us to go through the learning process so that the whole thing comes out very spontaneously. And it did help. On many an occasion in the film we improvised on the sets and did things which were not written down in the script. The method of communication helped.

The entire first half of Black is about 

you and the young Michelle, played by Ayesha Kapur. What was the experience of 

working with such a talented kid?

 Very, very fantastic. The girl didn?t know anything about cinema. She has never been to a film theatre. In fact the Black premiere last week in Mumbai was the first time that she ever went to a cinema hall. She doesn?t know who I am. She doesn?t know the Shah Rukh Khans and Hrithik Roshans. So it was quite remarkable for her to come up with such a performance.

Your scenes with Ayesha are sometimes very violent. 

Was it difficult doing those?

 No, those were just disciplinary slaps. They were not meant to be destructive. Such slaps do happen in a student-teacher relationship.

So much has been written about your amazing screen 

chemistry with Rani Mukherjee. How was it, working with her?

 Rani is such a spontaneous actor. She is so naturally gifted. I have seen her before in many films. I have also worked with her before. She is truly remarkable. With her in Black I had to be constantly on guard because you never know what?s coming next from her side.

Black has so many Bengalis around you ? 

Rani, of course, then Dhritiman Chatterjee and Nandana Dev Sen. Are they better 

than the ?others??

 (Laughs) I have never thought on those lines. Dhritiman, I have seen him in Manikda?s films and I have always admired him. And to have him with all of us is really fantastic. Nandana is also really good. That?s the best thing about the film ? there is no scope to find fault, even with the performances.

There is also a significant part of the film where 

you play the Alzheimer?s patient. Did you do any homework for that?

 Yes, I did homework for that too. Sanjay gave me a lot of tapes to watch and books to read. So I watched closely the symptoms of an Alzheimer?s patient.

You did more than 10 films last year but with one 

Black you have entered a different league altogether. Will you now be choosy 

about your roles?

 We have only one Sanjay Leela Bhansali. It doesn?t mean that if a film can?t match Black, I don?t do another film. Life goes on. I?ll continue to work till I get jobs. Black was quite an extraordinary experience. But one has to move on. And I am sure Sanjay will move on, too.

Will you be coming to Calcutta for Rituparno Ghosh?s 

film?

 Yes, I will be coming to shoot for his film in the latter half of the year and I am really looking forward to it.

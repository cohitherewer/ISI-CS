 Apartments, amenities and greenery

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A housing estate over 40 bighas. Flats for all income groups. Juxtaposition of lush greenery and latest amenities?

 Welcome to Sisirkunj, a venture of the Bengal Shelter Housing Development Limited (BSHDL) and the West Bengal Housing Board, to come up on National Highway 4, within the Madhyamgram and Barasat municipal areas.

 The estate ? being designed by Prakalpa, the Space Consultants ? will have 748 residential units and can accommodate more than 4,000 people. Each flat, ranging from 455 sq ft to 1,270 sq ft, will cost between Rs 2.5 lakh and Rs 14 lakh.

 The flats will be of three categories ? Anurag (low-income group), Purbarag I amp; II (middle-income group) and Swarnarag (high-income group). The Anurag flats will have one bedroom, Purbarag flats will have two or three bedrooms and Swarnarag flats will have of four bedrooms.

 Eighty per cent of the flats will be reserved for the low- and middle-income groups.

 The foundation stone of Sisirkunj will be laid by Jyoti Basu on August 28 and the project is set to be ready in the next 30 months.

 ?The cost of land is Rs 9 crore, and the total project cost has been estimated at Rs 80 crore,? BSHDL executive director Subir Sarkar said. ?The project is environment-sensitive and it aims to provide a healthy microclimate to residents by retaining greenery and maximum open space.?

 The highlights of the estate, according to officials, include a 2.5-bigha artificial pond, adequate cross-ventilation in all flats and availability of solar power.

 Only 42 of the 215 trees on the site will be felled for construction and 307 saplings will be planted.

 While the two municipalities will provide water, the builders will also bore tube-wells. Rainwater harvesting will be introduced to secure 30 per cent of non-potable water. A sewerage treatment plant, too, is being designed.

 The estate will also have a club, Kananbahar, by the pond and a ?state-of-the-art? mall, Panthapadap. The mall will house a multiplex, a food court, an auditorium, cr?ches, nursery schools and a nursing home, among other facilities.

 CU course, B-school aid

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta University (CU), in association with Globsyn Business School (GBS), has introduced a post-graduate diploma in applied economics and information management, with the aim of bridging the gap between formal education and industry demands.

 The course was launched by CU vice-chancellor A.K. Banerjee. ?Universities want industries to advise them on orienting courses towards the needs of the industries, therefore this is extremely relevant,? he said.

 The programme aims at equipping and conditioning graduates in the basic credo of managing information for organisations dealing with bulk business data, that require restructuring.

 Bikram Dasgupta, chairman and CEO, Globsyn Technologies Ltd, stressed how ?hugely critical? data analysis was, with the market for business processing gaining momentum. ?Specific skills are demanded by today?s industry, and industries are not only waiting for this to happen, but are also working towards this.?

 The USP of the course, claimed Dasgupta, is that it offers ?tremendous employment opportunities?, especially in diverse sectors like insurance, financial data analytics, market research, BPO and ITES.

 The faculty will comprise members of the Salt Lake-based business school and CU, along with academicians and industry professionals. Students will be given placement support through Globsyn?s corporate relationship cell while the varsity will award the diplomas.

 Graduates from any UGC-recognised university are eligible to apply by end-August, though preference will be given to students in the fields of commerce, mathematics, economics, statistics, geography, political science, sociology, BBA and BCA.

 The course curriculum will include IT, operations research statistics, research methodology, business communication, data gathering, data interpretation, conceptual framework of data analysis and management, accounting and financial management. The session commences by September 2005.

 Rajnis mate recollects

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY AND JULIUS GOMES

 Budding cricketer Rajnis Patel had died after five botched surgeries on his left shinbone, which he fractured on February 6, 2003, after colliding on the field with teammate Y.A. Khan.

 Khan, then 18, was called to the witness box on Wednesday in the court of Alipore sub-divisional judicial magistrate Manjit Singh. 

 Answering public prosecutor Naba Kumar Ghosh?s queries, Khan said he and Rajnis would practise at Bulan?s Cricket and Football Academy, run by Bulan Mukherjee. Rajnis, an all-rounder, used to play in the second division.

 On the day of the mishap, Khan recalled, the team was playing a friendly match. Rajnis was fielding at long-on and Khan at long-off. 

 As the batsman sent a ball soaring, both Rajnis and Khan ran to take the catch. With their eyes fixed on the ball, they ran into each other. Both fell to the ground, injured. 

 While Khan walked off the field with a few bruises on his elbow and knee, Rajnis had to be carried out, sent home, and later admitted to SSKM Hospital with a fractured shinbone.

 Around 10 days later, Khan left for Uttar Pradesh to attend his sister?s wedding. When he returned to Calcutta in July, Rajnis was dead. 

 In response to defence counsel?s cross-examination, Khan stated that he had not brought any documents to prove that he was a bona fide sportsman, associated with the same academy as Rajnis. The academy, however, has a list of all its members.

 Khan admitted that he had never visited Rajnis in hospital and did not know anything about the treatment, as he had been out of town at that time.

 Asked about his relationship with Rajnis, Khan said: ?I had known him since he joined the academy, about seven or eight years ago. He was my senior and I had good relations with him.?

 The next hearing has been scheduled for Thursday, when Rajnis?s uncle will testify.

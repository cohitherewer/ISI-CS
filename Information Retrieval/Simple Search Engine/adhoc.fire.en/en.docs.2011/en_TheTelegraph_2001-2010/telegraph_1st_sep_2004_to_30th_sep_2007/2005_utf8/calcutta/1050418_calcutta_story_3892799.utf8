 The Stadel, a hotel on the Salt Lake stadium compound: Mood upbeat. A Telegraph picture

 The hospitality industry is on a high and the middle segment is making merry. Touting an affordable tariff structure and facilities for fees quite few, the business luxury hotels have emerged favourites, especially among executives passing through.

 Ask the three new hotels in this segment that have come up recently. ?Three years ago, when The Stadel came into being, we could anticipate good business because of Sector V. The facilities and the tariff structure were planned with the business traveller in mind,? says Anil Bhutoria of The Stadel. The Salt Lake stadium hotel pegged its occupancy average at 90 per cent in the past year.

 The proximity to the Salt Lake Electronics Complex (Saltlec) is also vital to the success of The Sojourn, not far from the stadium. ?All facilities have been designed keeping in mind the needs of our customers. For example, we have Internet access in all our rooms, as most of our guests are from the IT sector,? says Sumit Dasgupta, spokesperson for The Sojourn, that started up this January.

 If the new players are doing well, the old players aren?t doing too badly, either. The room occupancy has been creeping up steadily, with 90 per cent a popular average to go by. ?In the hospitality industry, the concept of a lean period is fast fading out. It is often difficult to get a room in these hotels nowadays,? observes Ramnik Sabharwal, spokesperson for The Golden Park. ?There is always some sort of business activity happening in the city. And the mood is generally upbeat. As a result there is a lot of travelling happening in the region, and the hospitality segment benefits.?

 Calcutta?s role as the capital of the east has also had an impact on mid-level hotel occupancy. With most companies conducting their regional meetings and training programmes in town, ?the demand for rooms and food and beverages has seen a boost?, says R.K. Palta, general manager of The Astor.

 With mid-level employees on the move, industry insiders are confident that the upward trend is here to stay. ?The demand for this segment is only going to increase, as companies budget their travel expenses. In fact, a couple of five-star hotels are also thinking of opening up business luxury hotels in the city,? reveals M. Imtiaz Ahmed, general manager, The Senator, that opened its Camac Street doors in October last year.

 The facilities provided by these business hotels are comfortable rooms, Internet access, restaurants, a 24-hour coffee shop, a bar, a health club, boardrooms and banquets. ?The average stay for an executive is no more than three nights. The hectic meetings or site visits hardly leave them with any leisure time to check out places like the health club and the swimming pool,? explains Das.

 A lot has to do with location, too, with hotels like The Kenilworth, The Astor, The Golden Park and The Senator benefiting from being close to the city centre and The Stadel and The Sojourn cashing in on the busy Sector V.

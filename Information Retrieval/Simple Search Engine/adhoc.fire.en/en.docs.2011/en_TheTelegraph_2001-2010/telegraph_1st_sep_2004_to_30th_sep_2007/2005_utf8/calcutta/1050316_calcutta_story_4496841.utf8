 Mystery of maid suicide

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Almost 24 hours after Deepa Aich?s death, the Guptas of Jodhpur Park were yet to come to terms with it. 

 Having seen her grow up at their home over the years, it remained a mystery why the girl should set herself on fire. 

 ?On Monday, after lunch, Deepa went to the terrace to fetch clothes drying there and then disappeared. Around 2.45 pm, when her relative and another domestic help of the family, Chhobi Kar, went looking for her, she noticed that the bathroom on the terrace was locked and heard Deepa groaning inside,? narrated family driver Babloo Halder. 

 ?By then, she had turned into a torch,? Halder added. ?We have no clue why she did it. She had no apparent problem. She never said she was frustrated or unhappy.? 

 Police, however, have a somewhat different tale to tell. 

 Of late, Deepa had been having an affair with a local youth. She would often disappear in the afternoon to return late. ?This is a recent development. Otherwise, Deepa would step out only once from the house ? to fetch water from a nearby tap,? said a Lake Police station officer. 

 ?However, since she has not left behind any suicide note, we cannot jump to any conclusion,? he cautioned.

 Some residents of the area said the Guptas had robbed the girl of her freedom and would make her work without respite. They sought explanations even when Deepa stepped out to meet a friend, hinting at the psychological pressure under which she lived.

 Family members are not ready to even hear these charges. ?There was no one to keep a check on her, leave alone pick a fight with her,? said Chhobi Kar. 

 Police rule out any possibility of Deepa being forced to set herself on fire. 

 ?Based on our preliminary investigation, it appears that there were no scuffles when Deepa was in the bathroom. We have reason enough to believe that the girl had done it all by herself,? said a senior officer of Lake Police station.

 ?If it were not so, there would have been stains of kerosene on the walls. But it?s too early to comment. Her clothes will be sent for forensic tests soon,? he added.

 Doctors who attended on Deepa at the state-run MR Bangur Hospital on Monday evening said the girl had suffered over 90 per cent burns and her entire nervous system had been affected. There was no way she would have been able to overcome the burns, they pointed out.

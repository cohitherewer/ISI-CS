 Footbridges a drain on resources

Sadhan Banerjee: Women, children and elderly people need more footbridges in the city, particularly at Esplanade and Guru Nanak Sarani. Former mayor Subrata Mukherjee built two footbridges. Are you going to ask the mayor for more such structures?

 Footbridges are a wastage of public money and space. Footbridges at Lake Town, Sealdah, Rajabazar and Ultadanga are lying unused. They have become home to beggars and drug pushers. What we actually need are subways. Regarding Subrata Mukherjee?s constructions at Gariahat and Dhakuria, I think they serve advertisers more than elderly people.

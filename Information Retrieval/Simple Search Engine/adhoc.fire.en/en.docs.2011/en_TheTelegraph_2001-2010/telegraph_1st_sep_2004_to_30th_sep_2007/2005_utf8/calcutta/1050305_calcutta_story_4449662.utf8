Karen Anand may be trying her best to get clueless 

mama?s boys into the kitchen through the show Cook Na Kaho, but she still 

has plenty to offer the more sophisticated culinary hand. And her book titled 

Karen?s Anand?s International Cooking has ample evidence of this. 

Anand, who has her own brand of condiments and sauces 

available in supermarkets, does her best to touch on the basics of popular world 

flavours ? Mexican, English, Italian, Spanish, Lebanese, Thai and Japanese ? giving 

any cook a good place to start. After providing a brief insight into what makes 

a cuisine click, she has a handful of recipes.

Don?t expect too much exotica. For example, the English 

food section includes classics like Fish and Chips and Roast Turkey, as well as 

more unusual (to the Indian palate) options like Suckling Pig. But the advantage 

of this collection is that unlike many foreign cookbooks, Anand largely uses locally 

available ingredients. 

She covers some ground with her Mexican section, starting 

with a recipe for Crab with Devil Sauce from Chef Salvadore of the Taj President, 

Mumbai. Then she throws in some of her own blends for Chilli Con Carne, Corn and 

Capsicum Salsa, Guacamole and Lamb Chops. In the Italian section, Anand avoids 

predictability, with items like Chicken Liver Pate with Peaches, Veal Escalopes 

with Sage and Parma Ham and Seafood Risotto.

The Spanish section is not as invigorating, the starring 

dishes being Seafood Paella and Roasted Red Pepper Salad. Thai cuisine again includes 

red and green curries, as well as a Spicy Pomelo Salad with Prawns and Chicken.

Humous and Okra with Tomatoes in the Lebanese selection 

and Tempura, Prawns with Sake and Steak Teriyaki in the Japanese sections are 

also part of the suggested fare.

She provides a celebrity spin in the signature dishes 

section, with entries like Shiamak Davar?s Chicken Soup for the Soul, Prahlad 

Kakkar?s Prawn Malai or ?going down on Monroe? and Chef Bill Marchetti?s 

Tiramisu.

But if you are an avid fan of Cook Na Kaho, 

and you fit the demographic, watch out for Simple Cooking for Smart Men.

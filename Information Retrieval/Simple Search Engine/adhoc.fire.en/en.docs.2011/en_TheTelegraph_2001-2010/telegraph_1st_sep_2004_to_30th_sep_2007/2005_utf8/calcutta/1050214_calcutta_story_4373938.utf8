 Campus ado over hint of of fee hike 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Jadavpur University faces a storm of student unrest over a fee hike.

 What has fuelled resentment among the students is a proposal by the university to ?rationalise tuition and hostel fees? in the engineering departments. 

 The authorities have listed the proposal in their budget requirements, submitted to the state government. 

 To start with, the students will hand over a memorandum to the members of the university?s court on Wednesday.

 ?We will request the court to give us a clear picture about the proposal and what ?rationalisation of fees? means,? said a member of the students? union in the engineering and technology faculty.

 ?We will be compelled to intensify our protest if the authorities fail to give a satisfactory reply,? he added. 

 Besides seeking a ?rationalisation? of the fees, the university has also proposed a number of steps to raise money for paying provident fund dues. The students claim that a portion of the money to be collected from them, post-rationalisation, will be diverted to the fund.

 ?Apparently, the authorities have not talked about raising fees. But the word ?rationalisation? implies upward revision,? said Abhranil Saha, general secretary of the students? union. ?We will resist any move to raise our fees ? tuition or otherwise.? 

 The authorities, however, have denied any move to hike fees. ?The students? fear has no basis,? emphasised Manoj Mitra, dean of engineering and technology. 

 ?We have only said that we will set up the fund as directed by the state government. It does not mean that we will divert the money earned from students to the fund,? he reasoned.

 The university?s decision to set up the fund follows a government directive that the institution must generate resources for its contribution to the employees? provident fund.

 The government has categorically stated that it will no longer bear the provident fund burden of the university.

 Three years ago, a series of movements had rocked the campus after the authorities decided to raise library fees.

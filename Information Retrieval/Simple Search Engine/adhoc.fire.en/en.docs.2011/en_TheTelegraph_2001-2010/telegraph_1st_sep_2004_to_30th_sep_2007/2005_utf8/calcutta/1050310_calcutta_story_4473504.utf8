White metal magic

With minimalism being the mantra in precious 

jewellery, platinum is increasingly finding favour, says Himika Chaudhuri

The glitter of gold might have grabbed attention of 

the fairer sex down the ages, but for the modern woman who wants to marry class 

with style, platinum seems to be the new metal to weave its magic. 

Be it Hollywood beauties like Drew Barrymore and Kate 

Winslet , who dazzled in platinum while walking the red carpet recently, or the 

working woman next door, the desire to possess the purest form of metal available 

is on the rise. 

And with prices of the pretty pieces falling like 

leaves from an autumn tree, jewellery caskets of the city?s fashion conscious 

are filling up with the subtle, white metal that was once within the reach of 

only the super rich. 

Goodlife checks out the latest styles in platinum 

jewellery.

Minimalist mode

?Platinum jewellery is essentially very minimalist. 

The heavy look of gold doesn?t gel with platinum,? says Brinda Ganguly Sirkar, 

designer of the A. Sirkar group, one of the few stores in the city that sell platinum 

jewellery. 

The other reason for the minimalist look is the high 

cost of the metal. ?Very heavy pieces would render the prices too high for most 

customers,? adds Ganguly.

To popularise the metal in Calcutta, Platinum Guild 

International (PGI) releases the jewellery through its franchisee counters at 

leading ornament stores of the city. And to ensure affordability, the pieces start 

from Rs 5,000.

Trend talk

Small is beautiful in the world of platinum and that?s 

evident from the fact that the highest selling pieces are wedding rings and chic 

pendants. ?A lot of young couples pick up wedding rings in platinum since the 

metal signifies purity and is eternal in appeal,? says Sanjay Modi of Orra, an 

exclusive designer jewellery outlet. One of the highest selling products at Orra 

is the Couples Collection that has one ring each for him and her and is priced 

at Rs 20,000.

The designs, be it of the earrings, pendants or rings, 

are essentially contemporary and not fussy. 

?It?s meant for the modern woman who wants to don 

an elegant look and is not into elaborate jewellery,? says Ganguly. 

While pure platinum pieces are the classic favourites, 

two-tone jewellery that pairs 18-carat gold with platinum is also in these days. 

?The gold is matt in texture and goes well with the understated look of platinum,? 

feels Modi. 

The latest collection released by PGI, called Dewdrops, 

is inspired by water and depicts the flow of water in the designs. 

?The collection has been created with feedback from 

clients across the country and tries to capture the free-flowing, calming and 

pure effect of water,? said Vaishali Banerjee on behalf of PGI at the recent launch 

of the collection in the city. 

atinum is also a hit among diamond lovers owing to 

the fact that it holds the stone best, even better than 18-carat gold. ?Diamond-studded 

platinum pieces are doing very well now,? adds Shivankur Roy Chowdhury of MP Jewellers. 

Pick-up points

Outlets stocking PGI hallmarked jewellery are the 

best destinations for buying platinum pieces. These give a certain assurance of 

purity of the metal and also offers the right prices. The outlets in Calcutta 

include PC Chandra, BC Sen amp; Co, Senco Gold Jewellers, MP Jewellers, A. Sirkar, 

Orra and Tanishq.

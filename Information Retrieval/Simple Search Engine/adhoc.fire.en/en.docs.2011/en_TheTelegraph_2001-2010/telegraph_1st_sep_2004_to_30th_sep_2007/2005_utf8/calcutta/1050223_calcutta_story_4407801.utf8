The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 I take the Metro every day, and often see commuters, mainly school students, 

standing on the vestibule and enjoying themselves. Surprisingly, notices warning 

passengers against standing on the vestibule are missing in several compartments. 

If the commuters are fined for crossing the white line on the platform while the 

train is not in station then they should also be fined for standing on the vestibule. 

People should be made aware of the fine through TV announcements on the platforms. 

Surprise checks should immediately be started on moving trains to prevent accidents. 

 Gunjeet Wadhwa, Rai Bahadur Road. 

 Several mails are delivered to our house every month that are not meant for 

us. Letters from Calcutta Municipal Corporation and government offices addressed 

to the previous occupants of the house are also delivered in our mailbox. Why 

can?t the civic body and offices update their records? Unless the postal department 

is employing inefficient people, so many wrong deliveries are not possible.

 Shiv Shanker Almal, Lower Rawdon Street. 

 It is unfortunate that buses in Calcutta continue to emit harmful exhaust, 

thus causing health hazards to millions of people. My friend?s wife, a German, 

developed breathing problems after a two-month visit to Calcutta. She succumbed 

to the ailment recently after fighting it for six months. The transport minister 

should ban smoke-belching buses to avert such tragedies.

 State Central Library near Ultadanga crossing meets the requirements of a large 

number of students and research scholars. However, some of the science and technology 

books available in the library are old editions. New books, in general, have not 

been purchased in the library for a considerable period. Repeated requests to 

the library authorities have not yielded any result. I appeal to the library minister 

to address the issue. 

 Rabindranath Kar, Sankar Ghosh Lane. 

 Traffic snarls are a regular feature in the Bagmari-Maniktala stretch between 

10 am and 11 am. The buses plying on Maniktala Main Road are the worst hit due 

to the snarls. As a result, college students, especially, get late and miss classes. 

A flyover between Bagmari and Maniktala can help solve the problem. 

 Prasit Sen, Hatiara.

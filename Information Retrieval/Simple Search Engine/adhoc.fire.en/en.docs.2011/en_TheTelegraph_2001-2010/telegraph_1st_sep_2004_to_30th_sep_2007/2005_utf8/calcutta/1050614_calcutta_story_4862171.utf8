 Bulging biceps, over-oiled beef-cakes and trainers in want of some serious training themselves. The image of the para gym is being eroded, one posh pumping address at a time.

 On Sunday, Golds Gym became the first foreign player to join the city fitness fraternity at 57 JL Nehru Road.

 The gymnasium is spread across 8,000 sq ft and boasts of world-class equipment procured from select brands across the globe, used at all Golds Gym outlets, spanning 27 countries and 670 franchises.

 Calcutta is Golds Gyms third stop in the country after Mumbai and Chennai. 

 India is in the process of transformation. From retail equations to the food business, the change is fast paced, observed Luis Campalans, senior vice president, franchisee of the chain that was born in California, in 1965.

 Calcutta is an under-served city in terms of fitness options, he pointed out. There is huge demand here but local suppliers have failed on the supply front.

 A handful of high-end options have come up in recent years, but if the companys research is anything to go by, there is a need for much more.

 Tracking feedback from fitness centres in town, retailers and the pulse of the youth, the multinational was convinced that Calcutta is ready and waiting for weighty, sophisticated workout destinations.

 And nestled in the heart of the city, Golds Gym hopes to fill that need gap.

 From Los Angeles to London, this gym could be anywhere by the virtue of its equipment and training staff, said Campalans.

 The emphasis is on overall fitness of the body. Besides bodybuilding, the gym offers fitness and nutrition evaluation, massage therapy, body composition testing and physiotherapy consultation.

 The training personnel here have been trained at Golds Gym Mumbai. They are well equipped to address the problems of the guests and provide them with advice, said Divya Himatsingka, director, Ideal Gymnasium Private Limited, a licensee of Golds Gym.

 Membership comes at a price of between Rs 13,000 and Rs 20,000, with a number of schemes on offer. It is open through the week from 6.30 am to 10 pm and 8 am to 8 pm on Sundays. Plus, a membership in Calcutta gives reciprocal rights in other branches around the world.

 Ace designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee, Calcutta brand ambassador, was also present at the inauguration.

 There is a lot of latent energy among the people of Calcutta but most of it is not utilised. The times demand that we give health the priority we give to other important things in life. You workout or you fall out, he said.

 The chain has even managed to flex its muscle as far as Kabul. After all the unrest was over, we were approached by a bunch of local entrepreneurs who were excited about the idea of starting a gymnasium chain in the city. We could sense a good business opportunity there, said Campalans.

 The gamble paid off. Youngsters in Kabul have reacted to the fitness centre very enthusiastically. On average, he gets four calls every month from Iraq. I have told them they can wait, chuckled Campalans.

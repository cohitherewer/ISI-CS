 Gadgets as simple as a remote

Debashree Chakrabarty: What equipment do we need to download DTH signals? We have heard that setting up a dish antenna is costly. Moreover, one must have technical knowledge to operate it.

 Anyone who knows how to use a television remote control can competently operate the DTH system. As DTH transmission takes place through KU band, only a 60-cm dish antenna, converter and set-top box is needed to watch television. The high-end equipment costs around Rs 5,000, while basic gadgets cost as low as Rs 2,200. The dish antenna is light and can be mounted on a wall. However, it should ideally be put up on a roof for signal clarity. Basic technical knowledge is required to set up the dish, but after that, watching television is child?s play.

 Verdict boon for realtor-harassed

 A STAFF REPORTER

 There?s good news for consumers harassed by promoters and developers. 

 In a recent judgment, the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission held that people facing such harassment can approach the consumer court for justice.

 The National Commission, while disposing of two revisional applications filed by a city-based promoter, held that ?fora under the Consumer Protection Act are not civil courts, though they have trappings of the court. Bare perusal of sub-section (I) of Section 12(A) of West Bengal Building (Regulation of Promotion of Construction and Transfer by Promoters) Act, 1993, would show that it creates a bar on jurisdiction of civil court and not the consumer fora?. 

 The commission was hearing a revision petition filed by developer Basudeb Banerjee. He had constructed a building at Behala and handed over the flats to intending purchasers. The purchasers alleged that even after paying the entire amount, the developer had not executed and registered the deed of conveyance in favour of respective purchasers.

 The purchasers then filed separate cases before the District Consumer Forum (South 24-Parganas). 

 Upon hearing the case, the forum passed the order in favour of intending purchasers. The developer filed an appeal against the order at the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, which upheld the directive of the district forum. 

 But the developer preferred revision before the National Commission against the order and raised questions as to whether such cases can be entertained by the consumer fora.

 Relying on the provisions of sections 6 and 12A of West Bengal Building Act, 1993, the petitioners submitted that it was only the officer appointed by the state government, who could have adjudicated the disputes between the parties, and the district forum had ?acted erroneously? in entertaining and deciding the complaints.

 Section 12(A)(1) of the Act states: ?No civil court shall have any jurisdiction to entertain or decide any question relating to matters arising under any provision of this Act or the rules made thereafter.?

 To resolve the controversy, the National Commission referred to two previous cases and dismissed the revision. 

 After noticing the provisions of Section 18 of Recovery of Debts to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993, Section 15 of Railway Claims Tribunals Act, 1987 ? which deal with the bar of jurisdiction and Section 3 of Consumer Protection Act, 1986, the commission stated that there was no bar on entertaining a dispute by consumer fora.

 ?Bare perusal of said sub-section (I) of Section 12A would show that it creates a bar on jurisdiction of the civil court and not the consumer fora,? the commission said. 

 ?There is no illegality or jurisdictional error in the orders passed by State Commission warranting interference in revisional jurisdiction under Section 21(b) of Consumer Protection Act, 1986,? it added.

 ?The judgment will clear the path for hundreds of aggrieved purchasers of flats who want to file cases against developers at the consumer forum,? said Prabir Basu, lawyer who appeared before the National Commission on behalf of purchasers Amlan Bhattacharya and others.

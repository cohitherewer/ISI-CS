 Couple killer close to family, say cops

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Narayan Biswas and his wife Nita of Baguiati were murdered most probably by someone close to the family, police said on Tuesday.

 Twenty-four hours after the bodies were discovered on Monday morning in the ground-floor bedroom of the two-storeyed house at Narayantala, police said: ?We are still not sure of the murderer?s identity, but it is evident that he was well-acquainted with the layout of the house.? 

 A team of detectives has left for Behrampore to take the probe forward.

 ?It is still not clear how the murderer entered the flat in the middle of Sunday night. We are going through some vital leads and it will take a couple of days more to ascertain the killer?s entry and exit route,? said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas.

 Narayan Biswas, 59, and his wife Nita, 47, were found lying in a pool of blood on their bed. Preliminary medical examination revealed that both had been hit with a blunt object on the head and shoulders. Their landlord discovered the bodies.

 Their only son, Sumanta, told police that he was sleeping in a room adjacent to his parent?s bedroom when they were murdered. He woke up around 4 am and noticed that the door of his parents? room, usually kept open at night because both were ill, was locked from outside.

 ?I became suspicious and went out through another door in the toilet, which could be directly accessed from my room. I then called our landlord, Gour Kirtania,? Sumanta, an artist, told police.

 Kirtania came down from his first-floor flat and opened the couple?s room, only to find them lying dead on the bed. A sum of Rs 35,000 was missing from the almirah. 

 After conducting a spot-investigation, police conjectured that the killer had entered the apartment through the terrace door. 

 They are going through Biswas? agro-products manufacturing business in Behrampore. A police team was sent there to find out whether he had any business rivals.

 ?We learnt that Biswas had sold off his nursery in Behrampore a few days ago. He took Rs 60,000 as advance from the buyer and bought a computer for his son for Rs 30,000. Now, we will have to check whether there was any other claimant of the nursery or not,? said an officer working on this case.

 Police are preparing a list of assets owned by the Biswas family. ?We are trying to find out whether Biswas made any deed of gift of his property,? said the officer.

 Police are looking for the Biswas family maid, Lakshmi Das. They are interrogating the Biswas?s two daughters and sons-in-laws. ?We will also have to verify Sumanta?s statement,? police said.

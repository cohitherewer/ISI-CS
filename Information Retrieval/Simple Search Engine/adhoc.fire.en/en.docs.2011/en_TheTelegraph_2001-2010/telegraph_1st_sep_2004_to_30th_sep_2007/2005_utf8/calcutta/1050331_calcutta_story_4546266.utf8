The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

From academic excellence to tripe

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Ironically, Prof Pradip Sinha?s words on the decline of research work in Calcutta that he had spoken at Asiatic Society only this Monday, could well apply to the institute itself founded by Sir William Jones on January 15, 1784, the ?bounds? of whose ?investigations?will be the geographical limits of Asia, and within these limits its inquiries will be extended to whatever is performed by man or produced by nature.?

 Asiatic Society was declared an institute of national importance in 1984, the year in which it celebrated its 200th anniversary. At that time, the Society was in such financial straits it could barely afford to pay its employees. Post-1984, its elevated status proved, in many ways, to be its undoing.

 Flush with funds though it was now, Asiatic Society was riven with politics, with the coterie that had the support of the ruling party in the state trying to gain the upper hand. Although the Society had gained its new status owing to the efforts of its then general secretary Chandan Ray Chaudhury, who was close to Indira Gandhi, his opponents made sure he was marginalised. With Ray Chaudhury?s death in 1997, there was hardly anybody left to resist the appropriation of the Society by the clique that was hostile to him.

 The Society, once pre-eminent internationally for pioneering research and publishing in Indological studies and science, has turned into a gravy train which nobody in the good books of the ruling clique would give a miss. More than academic excellence what matters is kowtowing to the powers that be.

 Asiatic Society once attracted scholars from all over the world. Now it has become so parochial that blessings are showered on the chosen few, mostly from the city itself, whose allegiance is unquestionable. 

 Although Asiatic Society has 45 research fellows (there are seven vacancies), their output is not worthy of consideration. The Society?s publications are hardly the kind one expects of a premier research organisation. However, there is still quite a large market for high quality books on the subjects that Asiatic Society was synonymous with. 

 Without going back to its glory days, in the not-too-distant past, too, the likes of Ashin Dasgupta, Suniti Kumar Chatterjee and Sukumar Sen, to name a few, worked here.

 Little wonder justice is not done to its invaluable collection of archival materials, journals, manuscripts, gold coins and artefacts. Seminars and workshops are held but they are not worth writing home about. From an institution that nurtured academic excellence it has dwindled into a school for assembly-line education.

 Reputable scholar Sukumari Bhattacharji laments the fall of the Society. Bhattacharji says: ?The quality of the Asiatic Society Journal was of such a high order it was appreciated all over. The best publications on ancient world used to be available there. This was the only place one could find them and that is the way it should be. Now there are few members who are Indologists.?

 During Suniti Chatterjee?s time there was hardly any money but the stalwarts were there, the octogenarian scholar stresses. ?Even a few dedicated scholars would have changed the state of affairs. Now we hear of irregularities and illegal activity. The Bombay Asiatic Society is much better by comparison,? although it does not get a fraction of what the Calcutta institute does. A view supported by Sharada Dwivedi, leading heritage activist and writer of Mumbai. 

 However, Dilip Coomer Ghose, general secretary of the Asiatic Society, sounds very upbeat about the activities of the institute. 

 Ghose reels off an inventory of his achievements, among them an escalating budget. The Society?s planned budget for 2002-03 was Rs 1.75 crore, non-planned Rs 3.05 crore. 2003-04: planned Rs 1.8 crore, non-planned Rs 3.45 crore. 2004-05: planned Rs 2 crore, non-planned Rs 3.9 crore. 2005-2006 planned Rs 2.8 crore, non-planned Rs 4.1 crore.

 For Ghose, accounts score over academics.

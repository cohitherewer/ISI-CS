 Tradition unleashes creativity

 - Disparate worlds: Contemporary artists work in tandem with craftspeople

 SOUMITRA DAS

 The head by Rameshwar Karmakar at CIMA

 Strange and unforeseen things may happen when traditional artists and craftspeople work in tandem with contemporary artists to create works catalysed by the interaction and collision of two apparently disparate worlds. The works could challenge our credulity. 

 Rameshwar Karmakar, a middle-aged Dokra craftsman, is not likely to have heard of Guiseppe Arcimboldo (1527-1593), the Renaissance artist based in Milan famous for his ?surrealist? faces composed of fruits, flowers and suckling pigs. But Rameshwar has produced a fantastic (in every sense of the word) visage of brass, composed entirely of lizards and geckos and slithering women. Was this mysterious similarity a mere coincidence?

 The sap of life pulsates though his other works, such as Plate 1 and 2 and the tiny village bus, but he took creativity to the highest pitch when he produced this visage. Rameshwar, along with several other craftspeople and urban artists, had participated in a recent workshop organised by CIMA Gallery. Some of its fruits are now for us to see at the gallery.

 The traditional techniques of craftspeople had inspired contemporary artists to venture forth in realms they had rarely been to before. Tapas Konar has exploited the form of a percussion instrument covered with taut, translucent leather to wonderful effect. Konar?s works are inspired by Nidhubabu?s tappa and are infused with the eroticism of those 19th century musical compositions.

 When backlit, Samir Aich?s huge disc looks like an organic form that could be tree rings or a giant fossil. Set up on an iron frame, Aich used fibreglass to create Memory I that allows him to stretch the limits of his creativity. When traditional woodcarver Shankar Das was told to work on the same theme, he wondered aloud if memories of the body were also implied. He created a serene face with memories unfolding around it like the petals of a flower.

 Hiran Mitra and Kartik Sutradhar, who makes Chhou masks, have together given a very contemporary look to the traditional images of Kartik and Ganesh. When Hiran works on his own, he uses the same bright colours, but the forms are entirely of his own imagining. As usual, his work looks very eye-catching and has the smartness of promotional material.

 Abhijit Gupta?s work, particularly the head in a beauty salon and the other more abstract form, have a similar surface gloss. His Ganesh in wood has a similar stamp of cleverness.

 Such are the strange and diverse workings of the creativity unleashed.

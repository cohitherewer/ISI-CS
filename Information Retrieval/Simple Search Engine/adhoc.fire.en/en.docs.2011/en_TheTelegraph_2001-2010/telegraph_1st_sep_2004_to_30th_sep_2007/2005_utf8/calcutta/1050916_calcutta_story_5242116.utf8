 Revenge tragedy

 A tale of vicious treachery, intrigue and strife, Bechara Pechara is an exposition of the eternal struggle between good and evil. Laying bare the unholy nexus that exists between politicians and the police, it also treats allied social, economic and political issues with a frank, bold outlook. The play begins with a tussle, on the eve of the local municipal elections, between Prabhas Choudhury, a corrupt minister, and Arjun, a young, firebrand leader. When Arjun is killed as a result of political rivalry, Sinjini, his admirer and former co-worker, secretly vows revenge. One evening, Choudhury, and his long-time confederate, Sourabh, a police superintendent, find themselves invited to an empty rest house, where Sinjini lies in wait for them. Direction: Debashis Basu.

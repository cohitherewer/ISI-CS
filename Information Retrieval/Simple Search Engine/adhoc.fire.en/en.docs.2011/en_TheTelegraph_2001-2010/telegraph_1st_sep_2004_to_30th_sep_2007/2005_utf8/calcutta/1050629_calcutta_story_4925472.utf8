 Stricter traffic norms ahead

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 Alarmed at the rampant violation of traffic rules and the rising number of accidents caused by rash driving and illegal entry of trucks during periods of restriction, the transport department and traffic police have taken a joint initiative to frame stricter traffic rules. 

 According to transport department officers, some drivers habitually flout traffic rules as stringent measures are lacking.

 The existing rules allow police only to seize the driving license or blue books of anybody caught violating traffic rules and charge a cash penalty of a maximum of Rs 500.

 ?If we can make the laws stricter with provisions for hefty cash penalty and enforce the rules stringently, we can reduce the number of violations,?? said deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Arun Sharma.

 ?We have started working on this matter in consultation with transport department officers. Our plan is to make provisions for arresting an errant driver and charging a penalty of Rs 5,000, besides impounding the vehicle,?? Sharma added.

 Transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury said he would soon hold a meeting with senior traffic police officers to prepare a plan of action to enforce the traffic rules and compel the vehicle operators to abide by them.

 ?If the traffic police and the transport department start a joint initiative armed with stricter rules, we may bring back order on the roads,?? he said.

 The entry and movement of trucks is restricted in the city between 9 am and 9 pm. Truck operators have to park their vehicles in truck terminals or at any specified place if they reach the entry points of the city during daytime. Goods vehicles can enter the city only after 9 pm.

 ?Yet some drivers enter the city by bribing police. At least 10,000 trucks from the districts and neighbouring states enter the city through different entry points. Those trucks ply within the city to deliver goods to dealers ensuring traffic congestion,?? said a transport department officer.

 Many truck operators illegally park their vehicles along the National Highway, instead of the truck terminal.

 A monitoring committee comprising officers of the transport department, Public Vehicles Department, and traffic police has been planned. It will keep a vigil on roads to ensure that all vehicles abide by laws and that no truck strays in during daytime.

 Police teams will keep a vigil on some major entry points to the city, including at Kona, Baranagar, Barrackpore Trunk Road, Barasat, Dunlop bridge, Diamond Harbour Road and Jessore Road, so that goods vehicles cannot cross the entry points during daytime.

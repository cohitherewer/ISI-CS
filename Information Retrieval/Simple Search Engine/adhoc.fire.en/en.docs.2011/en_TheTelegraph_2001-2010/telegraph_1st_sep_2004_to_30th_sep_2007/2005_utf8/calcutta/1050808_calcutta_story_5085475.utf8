 Make a trip, learn about Mother Nature

 - Enviornment study made more interesting with eco-excursions

 RICHA BANSAL

 Modern High School took its students on an excursion to the Sunderbans in April this year and will be taking them to the Kanha reserve forest, in Madhya Pradesh, in September

 Mahadevi Birla Girls? School will take its students to Kanha 

 St James School will be taking its students to a forest reserve in north Bengal in October.

 Lakshmipat Singhania Academy will take its students to Sat Tal in Uttaranchal, known for its rich flora and bird sanctuaries

 MP Birla Foundation will take its children to Visakhapatnam for an insight into the ship-building industry and the threats of industrial pollution, besides village tours, for an understanding of the importance of living in harmony with nature.

 With the introduction of environmental education as a compulsory subject, city schools have started eco-excursions to enable children to experience nature at first hand and to inculcate in them a concern for the environment.

 Some schools had organised trips even before, but with the introduction of the subject, the authorities are reorienting the focus of the excursions.

 T.H. Ireland, principal, St James School, says: ?I will leave it to my teachers to make the trip more relevant to the subject. Though we had arranged such trips earlier as well, there is a heightened consciousness now.?

 Educationists think first-hand experience of nature will have a greater impact on the children. 

 According to veteran teacher trainer Ayesha Das: ?When children read about green conservation, they are merely memorising words written by someone else. But when they realise the inter-dependence between humans and the environment, their innate feelings for nature get stimulated.?

 Anutosh Kanoria, a Class XI student of Lakshmipat Singhania Academy, couldn?t agree more: ?I always liked nature, but when I undertook a trekking trip last year and was taught how to treat forests, it was a new beginning.?

 Herbert George, principal, MP Birla Foundation Higher Secondary School, points out that students will have to make a project on each excursion. ?Assimilation and reproduction based on experience is far more meaningful than a project based on regular research.?

 Some schools are also working on sustaining the interest beyond excursions. ?The drive to create awareness about the environment must be sustained even after the trip,? says Anjali Razdan, principal, Lakshmipat Singhania Academy. 

 Razdan has made environmental issues a topic of daily discussion at the morning assembly. One of the topics discussed recently, after the heat wave forced the authorities to close schools, was ?global warming?.

 Sharmila Bose, principal, Birla High School for Girls, says: ?We have not organised any trip as an add-on to the subject, but we are working on a proposal to have a trip next year.?

 Penury, debts drive duo to suicide

 - Swimmers find body floating in pool

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The burden of debts and poverty drove two persons to take their lives in different parts of the city over the past two days.

 Prakash Ranjan Choudhury, 42, a resident of Madan Mitra Lane, in the Amherst Street area, went missing from his residence on Wednesday afternoon.

 While his family members searched for him, Choudhury went to Hedua and waited beside the pool. 

 He jumped in after the swimmers left the pool in the evening and the area became secluded.

 Choudhury?s family had, by then, filed a missing diary with the police and had also stepped up their search in the neighbourhood. 

 On Thursday morning, a few local youths noticed the body floating in the pool just before taking a plunge.

 ?We were shocked to find a body floating in the pool. We spotted it almost accidentally, moments before we were about to dive in,? said one of the youths.

 The police were soon informed. They arrived at the spot and fished the body out of the water.

 ?We did not know the identity of the person, so we contacted police stations to find if someone of a similar description had been reported missing,? said an officer from Amherst Street police station.

 Before long, it was revealed that a middle-aged man had been reported missing in Burtola police station. Family members later identified the body.

 They told police Choudhury was going through an acute financial crisis and had run up huge debts.

 ?He was unable to repay his creditors and was extremely depressed. That, probably, led to his suicide,? said a family member.

 No suicide note was found, police said.

 Poverty claimed another life in Bowbazar, where Mohammed Alauddin, 35, was found hanging from the ceiling fan of his residence on Thursday afternoon. 

 Alauddin had been without a job for the past few months. He had been trying his luck at odd jobs, but without much success. 

 Feeding his family of six had increasingly become a problem for him.

 ?He had expressed his desire to commit suicide several times, but his family members had persuaded him to desist. With the situation turning more hopeless for him with every passing day, Alauddin killed himself,? said Munir Alam, a neighbour.

 On Thursday afternoon, Alauddin locked himself in his house and hanged himself with a nylon rope. 

 His family members said that he had bought the rope a few days ago. His wife and children found the body.

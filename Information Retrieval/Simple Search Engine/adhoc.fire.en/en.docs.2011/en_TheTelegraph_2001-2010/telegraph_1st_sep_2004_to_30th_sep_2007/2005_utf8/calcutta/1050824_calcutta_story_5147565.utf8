The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Your home?s on an emap

 - Virtual mapping boon for driving directions, locating landmarks

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 Salt Lake (east Calcutta) postal code: 700091. Regent Estate (south Calcutta) postal code: 700092. House A: 250. Next house: 25?

 Whether it?s erratic postal codes, little-known localities or confusing house numbers, providing driving directions to your door is often a tough task in the chaos that is Calcutta.

 Not if eLocation is your tech tool. All you need to do is locate your home on a map on the Internet, choose the nearest well-known landmark, type in directions from there and email or SMS it to friends? (see box).

 ?The Indian addressing system is very complex. As a result, most mapping software breaks down on the last mile while providing directions,? said Rakesh Verma, managing director of CE Infosystems, which has launched eLocation.

 The way out: creating one?s own e-location and sharing it, virtually. The service is the latest from www.mapmyindia.com, a one-year-old portal offering maps of Indian cities on the Net.

 Launched last week, the free service has already attracted 400 users, claims CE Infosystems. The company owns both the data and the maps, on which it has been working for a full decade.

 ?Calcutta alone took a couple of years,? shares Verma. ?It?s an old city that has densely clustered buildings. As a result, compared to say a Delhi, the satellite images of the city of Calcutta were not useful to us. We had to do a great amount of physical verification.?

 The one saving grace for the city?s virtual mappers was that almost every lane and bylane here has a name. But some of the newer and developing areas, like Salt Lake and Rajarhat, proved to be big challenges.

 ?We plan to make the concept as popular as email and the more people join in, the better directions will be provided,? feels Verma. Besides email, the links can be sent via text or multimedia messages to mobile phones.

 The service is currently free, though for a step-by-step and detailed guide, with a high-resolution view of the map, one has to sign up for an annual membership of Rs 5,000.

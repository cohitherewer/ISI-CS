 It's Your Birthday So...

 You?re 

an adventurer at heart, always ready for something new and challenging. Being 

too sensitive may cause pain; try to forget and forgive more often. Although you 

are cautious at the outset of relationships, it doesn?t take much time before 

you give it your everything. A little more of self-discipline may help increase 

your efficiency. ? Kusum Bhandari

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Sudden impact, recounted

 A STAFF REPORTER

 It was all smooth sailing, till what seemed like a ?bolt from the blue? hit MV Moni, bringing the vessel to a sudden halt.

 Sitting in one corner of a room at the office of the River Traffic Police at Babughat, M.S. Barua, the 66-year-old master of the barge, recounted how his vessel hit Howrah bridge.

 ?I was at the steering wheel and I thought everything was going fine when suddenly something banged into our vessel,? Barua said. ?At that point of time, I thought some other vessel had suddenly emerged and hit us. It took me a few seconds to realise that the mast of our vessel had hit the bottom of the bridge.?

 Barua said he was navigating the barge when it hit the bridge. ?The impact was so great that my hands slipped from the steering wheel and I fell on the floor, lying sprawled for a brief while,? Barua said. 

 ?When I finally realised what had happened, I got up and tried to figure out how best we could get out of the mess,? added Barua.

 Shortly after the barge had been freed and it had been escorted to the Shibpur jetty, Barua was detained by the police to find out how the accident happened. Later at night, he was arrested.

 Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) officers said prima facie it appeared to be a case of negligence on the part of master Barua. CPT chairman A.K. Chanda said a complaint was lodged with North Port police station. CPT officers will examine the legal aspects of the case since a compensation for the damage to the bridge is being sought.

 Barua recalled that once he had regained control of the steering wheel, he sought to straighten the course of the vessel. But it was veering more towards the Howrah bank and pulling in the opposite direction. 

 ?It was a futile effort on my part,? Barua said. ?In any case, by then it was too late for me to do anything. The barge was stranded and so were we.?

 Barua said at this point it seemed that ?my brains had packed up and it was not possible for me to take any rational decision.? 

 He said it had even slipped his mind to instruct engine operator Prasanta Debraj to turn off the engine. ?The propellers were still spinning and so the barge moved in whichever direction it could,? Barua said. 

 Barua finally asked Prasanta to try and make the barge move in reverse gear. But even this did not work. It was only then that the crew decided to engage the services of another vessel to try and free the mast from the bridge. 

 When this did not work, CPT officials were alerted and they arrived to take charge of the operation.

 Pond catch draws crowds

 - Fishermen net unidentified animal after fall in fish count 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Residents of Bantra, in Howrah, converged on a fisherman?s house on Monday to take a look at an ?unknown? animal he had netted from a pond in Unsani.

 Srikanta Polley, the fisherman, lives in Brindaban Mullick Lane and sells his catch from a nearby shop. He usually fishes in the pond. 

 At midnight on Sunday, Polley, along with eight other fishermen, started looking for the animal, since it was ?eating up the fishes in the pond?.

 Around 9 am on Monday, the animal, which is yellowish in colour and looks like a species of monitor, was netted. One of the fishermen was injured while hauling it to land. 

 ?The animal lashed its tail against his hand. The portion has swollen up and he is in great pain. I took him to a local doctor, who prescribed some medicines. He will have to be taken to the hospital if the pain persists,? said Polley. 

 ?The number of fishes in the pond was declining steadily for the past few months. Some of the men who fish in the pond told me that unknown animals were living in the water and eating up the fish. We undertook today?s operation to catch the beasts,? he added.

 According to Polley, there are four more such animals in the pond.

 The news of the unusual catch spread quickly and the neighbours started trooping to the fisherman?s house for a glimpse. 

 ?People of all ages were visiting the house in alarming numbers. I was worried that the children might hurt the animal,? he said. 

 The family took good care of the catch. It was given fishes and water, which it consumed with alacrity. The animal was then put in a cage, much to its dislike. It sustained injuries near the nose and cuts on the head while trying to burrow out.

 Polley later alerted the forest department. Two officials subsequently took away the animal.

 ?It will be sent to our rescue centre in Salt Lake,? said Joydeb Mukhopadhyay, divisional forest officer (DFO), Howrah.

 Another forest department official conjectured that the animal could be an Indian Yellow Monitor. ?These monitors are one of the most endangered species in the world,? he stated. 

 The DFO, too, couldn?t confirm the identity of the animal. ?I haven?t seen it. From its description, it seems to be a rare kind of monitor. Such animals are classified as ?threatened?,? Mukhopadhyay said.

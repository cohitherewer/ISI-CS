Petal perfect

Dry and artificial flowers help liven up 

the interiors in summer, finds out Himika Chaudhuri

Few things surpass the beauty of a bunch of vibrant 

flowers when you want to add a dash of colour to your home. Bringing in nuggets 

of nature livens up the inner space instantly, ensuring a fresh and bright feel 

throughout the day.

And with city florists filling up their racks with 

imported beauties, the options are wide when it comes to decorating your home 

with floral fare.

But with the summer sun burning bright, doing up the 

home with fresh flowers can be quite a tough task. Maintenance is the key here.

Says flower enthusiast and arranger Parul Swarup: 

?It?s impossible to keep a flower arrangement looking fresh for more than a day 

during these hot months.?

While the solution to this problem can be sought in 

replacing the flower arrangements with potted greens, the routine of keeping the 

plants indoors and then putting them out in the sun can get quite tedious.

?You can?t keep the plants out in the sun for too 

long because they?ll shrivel and you can?t keep them indoors all the time because 

they will wither without light. You have to know the right time span and this 

comes with experience,? explains Swarup. 

So, a good option for amateurs during these months 

is to shift to artificial or dry flowers, combined with various accessories to 

brighten up the home.

Silky smooth

Silk flowers are the order of the day during summer 

months. Available in various shapes and colours, these look almost real ? even 

up close ? and are perfect for large showpieces. ?Silk flowers are mostly imported 

from Australia. These are washable and that?s what makes them very convenient 

to use for flower arrangements at home,? says Indira Agarwal of Ferns amp; Petals, 

a national flower boutique chain with an outlet on Loudon Street.

Meant to jazz up the dry summer months, these flowers 

are majorly in demand this season, reveals Agarwal.

Ferns amp; Petals has recently done up the Camac 

Street residence of entrepreneur Mukesh Bhansali with these artificial flowers 

in hues of red, violet and yellow.

?We wanted to add a dash of colour to offset the dryness 

of summer. We have also tried to give a lively feel to the rooms, which are otherwise 

stark,? says Agarwal.

Natural dyed

A bunch of artificial blossoms will add colour and 

zing to your house, but to make the most of their aesthetic value, you should 

ideally team them with ?dries? ? palms and other foliage.

These usually-white palms and leaves are coloured 

with natural dyes to lend them myriad tones ? from purple to green and everything 

in between. A coat of varnish lends a sheen to the more gorgeous varieties.

?These long and lean leaves can be paired with flowers 

to create the main arrangement for a room. Alternatively, they can be put together 

in a planter and placed in a corner to fill up a gap or kill unused space,? explains 

Agarwal. 

The Bhansalis display dries in tall containers in 

several corners of the house. While one arrangement in the lobby uses palms in 

white and red, the more elaborately done up drawing room flaunts these along with 

dry flowers in shiny metallic purple.

Jazz up

Accessorising an arrangement well lend it the professional 

touch, but an eye for aesthetics is all you need to flaunt those flowers. Professional 

flower arrangers mostly use coloured stones, jute sticks, ceramic, glass and plaster 

of Paris containers. But you can always find a way of using leftover knick-knacks 

to jazz up the plants. From unused glass containers to trinkets left over from 

other arrangements, use your creativity to make the most of what is easily available.

Nature?s best

Even as fakes take over naturals during the dry months 

and fresh flowers bid goodbye, there are a few hardy varieties one can opt for. 

?Some flowers like birds of paradise, lily and antherium can survive up to a few 

days in this heat,? says Agarwal. Swarup recommends cactii during the summer months.

Fortune fig

To add a dash of natural green to the room without 

having to spend hours looking after it, one can opt for the fortune bamboo. These 

look like real plants, but are much easier to maintain. This also promises good 

fortune if placed in the house according to Feng Shui rules, say those swearing 

by the ancient Chinese wisdom of home-making.

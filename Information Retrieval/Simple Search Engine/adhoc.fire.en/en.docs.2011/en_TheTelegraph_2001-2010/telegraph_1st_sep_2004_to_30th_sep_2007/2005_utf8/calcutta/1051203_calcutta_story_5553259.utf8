The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Outnumbered, inert

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Around 1 am on Friday, some 40 minutes after Rick?s body was spotted inside the septic pit, the phone rang incessantly at Behala police station. 

 That was the first time police learnt that the missing boy?s body had been finally traced, almost 14 hours after he went missing. 

 But with no inkling of the strength of the mob, the reaction was seemingly casual. A sub-inspector and three constables left for the spot, but they had no clue to the tension simmering on James Long Sarani.

 They were stunned when they reached the spot. A few hundreds had taken over the area and the narrow lane where the Boses lived off James Long Sarani. The small police team felt helpless.

 ?We immediately called the police station. We even told the officers to inform the control room at Alipore to send a larger contingent,? said one of the officers of Behala police station.

 What he didn?t add was the time it took for police to respond to this urgent call.

 By the time the first contingent arrived and had taken up position on James Long Sarani, the mob had already vandalised the two-room Bose house in the small lane leading to a huge pond. 

 The furniture was in pieces, the bed tossed away and documents were scattered all over. Rabindra Nath Bose had been dragged out, along with his wife Bela and son Kaushik.

 Initially, police tried to stop the mob but as hundreds had taken over, they stepped aside. Around 1.20 am, a message was sent to bring in a contingent of RAF. 

 This despite police being aware of the tension that was gradually building up in the area since afternoon.

 By 2 am, when the RAF arrived, the crowd was already mauling three members of the Bose family. Son Kaushik had fainted and his parents were struggling, even as crowds bayed for their blood.

 ?Around 2.40 am, when I stepped out, I saw a huge crowd beating up Bela and her husband. The two were lying on the road, as women beat them with chappals and others thrashed them with sticks. Suddenly, one of them set the two on fire. Police stood as mute witnesses. They were clearly outnumbered,? said Biswanath Das, one of the witnesses. 

 Police have a different story to tell. They claim that had it not been for the additional contingents, the area would have gone up in flames and the father-son duo could not have been saved.

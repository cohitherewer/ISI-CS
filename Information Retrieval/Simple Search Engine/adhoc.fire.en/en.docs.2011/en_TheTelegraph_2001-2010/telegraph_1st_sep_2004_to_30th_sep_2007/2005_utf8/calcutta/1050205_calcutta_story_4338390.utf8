 Spot-the-college scurry for grant

 - University screens names to recommend for Presidency-style UGC aid

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The Calcutta University authorities on Friday held an emergency meeting of its undergraduate council to draw up a strategy on how to select the second lot of colleges that it can recommend to the University Grants Commission (UGC) to avail of hefty grants under its ?Colleges With Potential for Excellence? scheme.

 Nearly six months ago, when the UGC had completed the first round of selection under this scheme, Presidency College was the only institution from the entire state to be awarded the status of a ?college with potential of excellence?. Each college that receives the award gets between Rs 35 and Rs 70 crore from the UGC. 

 Nearly 12 colleges in the city have applied to the university for their names to be recommended to the UGC in the second round, Ananga Mohan Chanda, inspector of colleges, said after the meeting. Among the applicants are St Xavier?s College, Loreto College and Scottish Church College.

 The university on Friday hurriedly convened the meeting as the UGC had sent a directive to the authorities last week, directing them to send the final list of names of colleges, latest by February 11. 

 After the meeting, university officers said: ?We are trying to make the selection procedure as brief as possible, considering the UGC?s February 11 deadline.? To expedite the process of screening the colleges, the council members attending Friday?s meeting drafted certain criteria. 

 ?We will take into consideration the applications of only those colleges that have received high ratings from the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC). We are rejecting the applications of those colleges that were rated below Grade B by NAAC,? said an officer.

 The council said colleges running postgraduate courses in emerging subjects related to bio-science will be given priority. 

 The council members strongly felt that the university should approach the UGC to extend the deadline for submitting the second list of colleges.

 ?Even though the UGC had posted on its website that universities across the country will have to submit proposals for receiving the grant under the scheme within February 11, the UGC has written to us about the deadline only a few days ago,? an official said.

 Sources in the university said Suranjan Das, pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs), who is in Delhi now, has already been asked to negotiate with the UGC to defer the February 11 deadline.

 Higher education department officials said the UGC had written to the state government to make arrangements for informing other universities in the districts to send in the names of their affiliated colleges to apply for the grant.

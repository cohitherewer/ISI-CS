 Stranger storms the town

 - Bachchan?s ?comeback? counters open big and busy

 Amitabh in Ek Ajnabee

 December 2, 1983: Manmohan Desai?s Coolie opens to historic advances and goes on to become one of the biggest hits of the decade. The USP? Amitabh ?coolie? Bachchan?s screen comeback after being critically injured during the shooting of the film.

 December 9, 2005: Apoorva Lakhia?s Ek Ajnabee is set to open to record advances across the country. The USP? Amitabh ?stranger? Bachchan?s screen comeback after being operated upon for diverticulitis in a Mumbai hospital.

 If the advances at the ticket windows in city cineplexes are anything to go by, history should repeat itself 22 years and one week later. Increased print prices, unprecedented queries and a sympathy wave should script another big Bachchan hit in a year that has seen him score with Black, Waqt, Bunty Aur Babli and Sarkar.

 ?Ever since Mr Bachchan has been hospitalised, Ek Ajnabee has become very hot among exhibitors,? admits Aroon Sharma, distribution head of INOX Leisure Ltd, which is handling the release in Bengal. ?The price per print has risen from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 2 lakh and we expect every print of the film to make Rs 5 lakh.?

 When the ticket counters opened on Wednesday, there was a huge clamour for Ek Ajnabee tickets, from the first plex (Elgin Road) to the latest (Hiland Park).

 While there are two other new releases this Friday ? sleazy Kalyug and yuppie Neal ?N? Nikki ? it is the ?angry old man? everyone wants to see.

 Within a couple of hours of the advances opening, more than half the tickets for the first weekend were booked at INOX and 89 Cinemas. ?Queries for tickets had started ever since he was hospitalised,? says Prashant Shrivastava from 89 Cinemas.

 Even the single-screen theatres recorded a smart start at the advance counter. Says Bimal Das, manager of Jyoti theatre in central Calcutta: ?The practice of advance bookings is gone but almost 25 per cent of Ek Ajnabee tickets have been booked.?

 If Bachchan the bodyguard is storming town this weekend, Bachchan the baddie will arrive two Fridays later, on December 23, in Rajkumar Santoshi?s Family: Ties of Blood. But will it end up being another Pukar, which released two weeks after Coolie and sank?

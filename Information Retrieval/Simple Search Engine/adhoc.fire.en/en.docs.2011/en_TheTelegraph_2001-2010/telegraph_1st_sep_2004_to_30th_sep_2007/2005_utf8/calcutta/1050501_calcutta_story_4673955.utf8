 Shelters well-earned by faithfuls who serve

 Sirajuddin Ansari has been serving fresh lime and beef steak to the members of Calcutta Rowing Club (CRC) for the past two decades. The Ansaris, having migrated from Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh, are now in town for seven generations, but they?ve never had a roof above the head they could call their own.

 Mohammed Shamshed Shah sleeps on the floor next to the club?s ethnic bar counter after the last guests have left. He has been doing so for 13 years now. All that is going to change soon. He can return to the warmth and security of his ?apna makaan?, to his wife and three kids. So can Siraj.

 All thanks to the members they so faithfully serve, in rain and shine.

 A rare initiative by the authorities of the rowing club has ensured that members of the staff have a brick-and-mortar shelter for themselves. The CRC management gifted a five-cottah plot of land to the staff, funded through donation from members, on which the employees are constructing a building to house 12 two-room units, complete with kitchen and bathroom.

 The building near Haridevpur under the Thakurpukur police station is coming up with the help of individual bank loans from Punjab National Bank. The Rs-600 house rent allowance from the club accruing to each employee is going towards EMI for repaying their loans, according to an agreement with the bank. 

 On completion of the project, the individual staff member will be the legal owner of each unit.

 ?We are only helping them in preparing drawings, selecting the contractor and ensuring quality of construction, which will be jointly supervised by our sub-committee members and staff members,? says Chandan Roy Choudhury, immediate past secretary and coordinator of the staff housing project.

 Twelve of the 40-strong workforce at the Dhakuria lake club who opted for the housing scheme are now a relieved lot. ?Most of them had come from Bihar or Uttar Pradesh and have been in Calcutta for generations. But they don?t have a home and stay in dingy rented places or in shanties and, hence, are extremely insecure,? observes Roy Choudhury.

 Now, Ful Mohammed, who has served CRC for the past 40 years, doesn?t have to worry about where to go after superannuating. Mohammed Shamsuddin Ali, on the club?s payroll since 1993, has a while to go before he hangs up his livery. But the thought of moving into his own home with family, by early next year, brings a contented smile to his face.

 Staff welfare has always been high on the agenda of this antique institution established in 1858. When Ali Mohammed, Shamsuddin?s elder brother, fell down and fractured his leg, he was rushed to a Swiss Park nursing home for treatment, cost borne by the club management. 

 A computer training programme has benefited those keen to pick up the basics. Now, Mohammed Abdur Rashid, a ?non-Matriculate from Bihar?, can handle the club?s billing system efficiently on the computer.

 It?s hardly one-way traffic, though. ?We look forward to the phataphati khichuri and begun bhaja they prepare for us on Saraswati Puja,? smiles a member. The vermicelli and parathas on Id are special attractions, too, at this idyllic waterside rendezvous.

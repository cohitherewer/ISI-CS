The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A memorable mastermoshai

 Now I can die a peaceful death.? These words were spoken by Gopal Chandra Patra, former headmaster of Baikunthapur Primary School, West Midnapore. The legendary mastermoshai had just been inducted into The Telegraph Education Foundation Hall of Fame at The Telegraph School Awards function on November 6 last year. 

 He embraced a ?peaceful death? the very next day in a nursing home in Ghatal where he was being treated for cancer of the gallbladder. He did not accept any gift on that day.

 Instead, he requested The Telegraph Education Foundation (TTEF) to distribute the amount to needy and meritorious students of the area. The foundation promised Gopalbabu that it would. It kept its promise on July 29, the death anniversary of Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar, mastermoshai?s role model. 

 Less than a hundred yards from his ancestral home in Dadpur, West Midnapore, TTEF distributed Rs 50,000 to about 140 deserving students of Ghatal subdivision, including Baikunthapur Primary School.

 Chief guest Swapan Pramanik, vice-chancellor, Vidyasagar University, speaking on the occasion, urged the local people to make Gopalbabu their idol. Trustee Sukanta Chaudhuri, highlighted the ?humble? efforts of TTEF and expressed a deep sense of gratitude to the representatives of Heritage, Biswanath Dasgupta and Partha Ghosh, who scout through the year to find teachers and students who have fought the odds and won. 

 Barry O?Brien, secretary of TTEF and the force behind Heritage, the organisation that manages the foundation, urged the awardees to discard their inhibitions and complexes that come with ?not being from the city?. ?You are as special and talented as any one of the city?s young stars and we will go deeper into the districts and villages of West Bengal to find more heroes like you,? said O?Brien. 

 In a letter to TTEF, after learning of the honour that awaited him, mastermoshai wrote: ?I shall die, but I hope that the torch I kindled will never be extinguished.? 

 If TTEF and other like-minded organisations continue to ?keep their promises?, it never will.

Life on a platform

 It was a bright summer morning and we were on the Ispat Express, on our way to Kharagpur, the venue of the youngest chapter of the Muktangan project. It is a partnership between Calcutta-based NGO Praajak and the Railway Protection Force (RPF) to provide non-institutional care to underprivileged children who earn their living from odd-jobs on railway platforms in Bengal and are in need of protection. 

 The children often shoulder huge financial responsibilities on behalf of their families. They are exploited, abused, and usually incur the wrath of the policemen who are assigned to keep the stations ?clean? and ?crime free?. Muktangan also endeavours to repair the relationship between the children and the RPF. By attempting to involve the RPF to start a preventive crime intervention programme with these railway children, Praajak aims at bringing about a symbiotic change to better the lives of these kids. 

 The project is spearheaded by the RPF, which provides basic infrastructure and facilitates the direct interaction of its personnel with the children. Praajak assists through technical, financial and logistical support, such as training the RPF personnel and equipping them with tools and techniques to effectively deal with the children and be sensitive to their needs. The Muktangan model of non-institutional care for children living on railway platforms has been replicated in stations in Burdwan, Sheoraphuli and Malda. 

 A blistering walk under the scorching summer sun and a rickshaw ride took us to the drop-in centre, where the platform children congregate after a morning of labour to participate in sessions with the RPF, take baths and afternoon naps, play games, learn the alphabet and numbers. We met Shankar, the solemn class monitor who was determined to put up a show of order and discipline, sitting stiffly and responding to our queries. Slowly, he lost his inhibitions and gave us warm smiles. 

 We learnt that many children shy away from these centres. Boys like Shankar can do little to convince them otherwise, as such attempts inevitably culminate in violent scuffles and brawls. Most of these children enjoy their independence. One of the things that draw them to the centres are meals, if provided. Boys like Shankar enjoy coming to the centre, but their presence here is almost always at the cost of earning enough to buy the day?s lunch. The RPF and Praajak are trying to make arrangements for food for the kids who regularly spend their afternoons at the centre. 

 More interactions with these children, and a few survival strategies were revealed. We were appalled to hear that some of them often spend nights on moving trains to escape the platforms, catching the earliest train back to Kharagpur from wherever the train leaves them in the morning. 

 A day with the children opened our eyes to their alarmingly severe addiction problems. Meet Sheik Soni, a lanky 15-year-old. He wears a lopsided grin, speaks with a slur, teeters and staggers as he walks and his eyes are wet and unfocussed. When he enters the room, you recoil slightly at the odour of Dendrite (glue) that wafts into the room with his arrival. Soni has a handkerchief in his hand, and every 15 seconds he stuffs it into his mouth and takes long drags from it, his body shuddering with relief and pleasure. 

 Throughout our visit, he keeps taking drags. When we take away his handkerchief, he licks and sniffs his fingers with savage urgency. He wants to become a waiter in a hotel, yet speaks as if he has given up on his future. There are other boys behaving similarly. Most blame their addiction on the impending and inescapable threat of withdrawal symptoms. What angers us is that the local paan shops are stocked with Dendrite and other addictive substances. Such easy availability of addictive substances is a major factor for their widespread use among the youngsters. 

 Consumption of such substances helps stave off hunger, often allowing them to go without food for a day. One Ludo game and some conversation later, I asked the boys if they were willing to work with ?uncles? who would help them do away with their addiction. They enthusiastically nodded their assent. Whether it was an obligatory attempt to appease visitors or a genuine desire to work towards de-addiction is a dicey question. 

 It had been only a few hours, but the children had shared some of their most intimate secrets with us. They sang, danced, raked up their painful past. The evening session winded up with everybody standing in a circle, solemnly singing the national anthem and signing off with cries of ?Bharat mata ki jai?. 

 Time for us to go. It was a difficult goodbye for the children, who shook hands with us and demanded to know when we would visit again. As the evening Ispat rolled out of the station, they tried to follow us as far as possible by jumping on and off the trains till it picked up speed. The smiling faces and furious waving receded into the distance. We took back memories, a heart-wrenching realisation of reality and a compelling desire to make a difference.

 Burning truth

 On July 29, the media reported the breakout of a fire on the fourth floor of Ashok Hall Girls? Higher Secondary School. Some gave exaggerated reports, some told the truth, and some told complete untruths. As a student of the school, I would like to tell the story as it happened. 

 Firstly, it was a very small fire and was under control even before it could practically start. It broke out in the staff room of the fourth floor, and the mechanic who was supposed to be fixing the gas cylinder fled the scene without attempting to control the damage. Not one student was hurt. Fire extinguishers were brought immediately and the fire was put out within seconds. 

 Students were immediately evacuated. The teachers, prefects and senior students took instant charge, making the rest of the students vacate the school building and taking care of some juniors who were inclined to be hysterical. Principal M. Kak was not in Calcutta and B. Bhattacharya, our vice-principal, and senior teachers took control of the situation. 

 The fire engines arrived, and so did the press. Anxious parents, who had already reached the scene, demanded that their wards be handed over to them. Within an hour, all of us were taken to Industry House. I am very proud of our vice-principal, senior teachers, all my friends from Classes XI and XII and Manjushree Khaitan. I have been in this school for 13 years, and I think I have never felt so proud of it as I do now. 

 The newspapers and TV news channels reported absolute chaos and confusion, which did happen initially, but was controlled within minutes. A mountain was made out of a molehill.

Corporate games

 The ongoing National Competition for Young Managers 2005 (NCYM) of All India Management Association (AIMA) got off to a flying start, with Tata Motors, represented by G. Ramaswamy, J. Mukherjee and Dev, winning the eastern regional finals, while Bokaro Steel Plant, represented by A. Prakash, S. Kumar and Salini Sinha, were the worthy runners-up.

 The theme for this year?s NCYM was ?The best of the best ? insights from leading international and Indian organisations?. Over 30 teams of working executives and managers represented companies like Tata Steel, Indian Oil Corporation and Aditya Birla Management Group. The participants gave presentations and deliberated on the best practices in the industry, their nature and feasibility.

 The winners were presented with the P. K. Sen Memorial Award, while the runners-up were presented with the Late Shalabh Tamotia Award. The two teams will now compete with the winners of the other three regional finals, at the National Grand Finale in New Delhi on August 20.

 Speaking on the occasion, Kamal Singh, director, CMD, AIMA, said: ?Keeping in mind the pace at which the market forces are changing owing to increased competitive intensity and technological breakthroughs, we realise a need for Indian organisations to come on a par with global practices. NCYM is a platform for the young managers to explore and learn from the best of the best practices of Indian and international organisations.?

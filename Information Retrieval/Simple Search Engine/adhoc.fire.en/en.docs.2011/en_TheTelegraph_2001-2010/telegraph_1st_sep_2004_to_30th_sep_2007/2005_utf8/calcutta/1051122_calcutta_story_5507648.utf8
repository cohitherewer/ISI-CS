The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 For laughter and for tears 

 She hasn?t had a hit yet, but the biggest of Bollywood makers are ready to put their money on the bubbly AYESHA TAKIA. Pratim D. Gupta asks her why

 ?It all depends on one Friday and one movie,? says Ayesha Takia, whose Home Delivery releases in December

 Home Delivery is easily your biggest release yet?

 You can say that. Everybody looks forward to something new in his or her career. The kind of film Home Delivery is, it is unlike anything I have done before. It is sure to be a very exciting release. It?s a comedy and it?s a love story and it?s turned out to be a very, very rocking film. Home Delivery took me back to the days of my debut film, Socha Na Tha, where I just had to be natural.

 You just had another comic release in Shaadi No. 1. How different is the humour from Home Delivery?

 The two comedies are very, very different. Shaadi No. 1 is out-and-out slapstick. It?s silly and very insane. Home Delivery on the other hand is a comedy based on characters. It has its own flavour.

 That must be due to writer-director Sujoy Ghosh. How was he to work with?

 Absolutely great. If I am offered 100 more films with him, I will definitely do each one of them. The best thing about him is that he lets you play your character your own way. So you become a part of the film and not just a cast member.

 Despite the film having you as the solo lead, there?s a Mahima Choudhary cameo, too. Was it awkward?

 I don?t know why people say there is always a problem between two heroines in the same film. Two male actors can have some problem on the sets too. Mahima is an intelligent and secure woman. So am I. She has a lovely role in the film and I also have a well-defined role. Both the characters are distinctly different.

 There?s everyone from Abhishek Bachchan and Naseeruddin Shah to Karan Johar and Juhi Chawla making special appearances in the film. Was it intimidating?

 It wasn?t intimidating at all. In fact, it was lovely to have so many people, and so many known people, being part of the film and encouraging everyone. Even if it?s a two-minute appearance, all those people were having so much fun just being in the middle of the action.

 Moving on, what was it like being directed by Naseeruddin Shah for his debut project?

 I just finished shooting for Yun Hota To Kya Hota. It?s an emotional film based on the 9/11 incident. So it?s sad and also serious. Working with someone like Naseeruddin Shah for so many days, I really got to learn so much.

 What other films can we see you in?

 There?s Shaadi Se Pehle coming in January, which is produced by Subhash Ghai?s Mukta Arts and has Akshaye Khanna opposite me. The film?s directed by Satish Kaushik. Then there?s another film opposite Akshaye Khanna, Salaam-e-Ishq, directed by Nikhil Advani. I am slated to do another film with David Dhawan to be produced by UTV. That has Zayed Khan opposite me. Zayed?s also opposite me in another film I will do with director Yousuf Khan.

 With so many Bollywood makers banking on you, do you think you have arrived?

 (Laughs) You can?t really say whether someone?s arrived or not. It all depends on one Friday and one movie and everything can change. People may start loving or hating you very quickly here. It?s a very insecure world.

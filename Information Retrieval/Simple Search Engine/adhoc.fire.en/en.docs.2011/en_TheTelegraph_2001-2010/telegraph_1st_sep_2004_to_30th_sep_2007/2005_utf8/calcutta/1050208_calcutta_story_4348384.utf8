Red riot in love lair 

With Valentines Day round the corner, 

Ipsita Deb spells out ways to create a romantic retreat at home

Why restrict romance to Valentine?s Day? The key to 

keeping the fires of passion fuelled all year round could lie in creating your 

very own little love nest at home. Being the place where people, on an average, 

spend one-third of their lives, it?s definitely worth to invest in your bedroom 

ambience. So, turn the bedroom into a beautifully romantic boudoir that is your 

own private retreat where you can indulge in all that?s fun, flirty and passionate.

With red being the colour of passion, a sizzling atmosphere 

can immediately be created by drenching the walls in bright scarlet or crimson, 

but keeping two of them white to tone it down a bit. 

The drapes should be kept as ?touchy-feely? as possible 

with velvet and satin being the obvious choices. Let these fall in folds to the 

floor and tie them back with silk scarves in pink or red.

For privacy through the day, layer a pretty white, 

pink or red voile underneath to let daylight filter through but still keeping 

out prying eyes. While flooring your man should be your immediate concern, make 

sure to keep the floors in sync with the walls. Use a comfortable carpet that 

matches the duvet covers printed with red roses, scarlet cushions and soft satin 

sheets.

After taking care of the practicalities, start accessorising. 

Be it anything from a telephone in the form of red, pouting lips to heart-shaped 

cushions to something naughty, yet nice. Avoid pillar candles and opt for tiny 

red glass votives scattered around the room to cast a seductive, flickering glow.

Fill up the senses

Most interior designers believe that the key to a 

romantic bedroom lies in its ability to appeal to all five senses.

Touch: The bed is obviously the focus of any bedroom 

and making it as cosy as possible is essential. Luxurious sheets and plush pillows 

are wonderful, but a comfortable mattress is the most important.

Sight: Lighting should be left soft and filtered as 

bright lights are rather unattractive and great passion-busters! Using low wattage 

lights are good, but for a special evening like V-Day, nothing works better than 

the warm glow of candles.

Smell: While aromatic candles are great, gently wiping 

your light bulbs with a thin coat of perfumed oil can also send calming or sensual 

scents throughout the bedroom. In addition, putting incense on your sheets and 

pillows is advisable as is keeping some scented sachets of lavender.

Sound: Soft music is one of the easiest means of elevating 

one?s mood. If your room is near a busy street, thick curtains can help muffle 

the noise. And, perhaps the biggest distraction of all ? the television ? should 

be kept outside the four walls of your romantic retreat.

Taste: For some late-night indulgence, place strawberries 

and whipped cream on a small tray next to the bed. Champagne and champagne glasses 

are expensive, but very romantic options for an evening in.

Zen zing

The south-west corner of the bedroom is the marriage 

corner. According to Feng Shui expert Pinky Kapoor: ?The elements of earth and 

fire must be in harmony within this zone. While the former denotes stability, 

the latter stands for passion. By keeping objects of both elements, one?s love 

life is bound to improve or be on the upward curve.?

Crystal objects and a bowl filled with semi-precious 

stones or an amethyst rock are ideal for the earth element, while the fire factor 

can be stoked by lamps, candles and photographs.

?Each person has a personal marriage direction that 

is a result of their date of birth and core number and an analysis of this, with 

regard to bedroom basics, is certain to enhance the love quotient within this 

retreat,? adds Kapoor.

The lighting level is also taken into consideration 

so as to ensure that it is not too harsh (yang) nor too dim (yin).

Decor delights

While excess on V-Day eve is often the mantra, what 

works the best is creating a simple something with almost nothing at all.

For starters, dig out those CDs that otherwise grow 

roots in the cupboard. Make sure the music is unobtrusive. If you?re going for 

the classical, harp and piano concertos are a good bet, otherwise jazz is a good 

option. Mushy love songs from down memory lane can be a clich?, but if they work, 

they work.

?The bed, too, should have a sense of romanticism 

and a touch of feminism. A soft headboard is ideal. Hang drapes over the bed by 

using saris or dupattas through a ring. 

Since people are not going to change their furniture 

for one day, get creative with billowy pillows and quilts, having a satin feel 

and indulge in candles, photographs, flowers and lots of subtle lighting,? suggests 

interior designer Anita Mansatta.

Candlelight has always been the light of love. It?s 

also cheap and easily available ? no fittings, bulbs, correct placing, etc. If 

you just switch off all the lamps and buy three or four pretty candles, it?s the 

ideal sensory stimulant to the scene. If you?re planning to accessorise with cushions 

and fabrics, then think about using a mixture of materials. The best bet is to 

use contrasting textures so as to layer them (example velvets contrasting with 

silk and satiny finishes).

Minimise clutter and make sure the room is cosy and 

warm. Cook something that smells good or keep floral scents. Never forget the 

flowers. Red roses mixed with other scented flowers are ideal.

So, go entice your Valentine with a love nest that?s 

snug, soft and sensuous.

Family has always been Koel Mullick?s fulcrum. And 

the darling daughter of Bhowanipore?s Mullickbari has got herself a grand 

New Year?s gift ? a Family in Mumbai.

A busy actress in Tollywood, Koel has landed a plum 

role in AB Corp?s forthcoming venture Family, starring Amitabh Bachchan 

and Akshay Kumar. She has been cast opposite Aryeman, son of Keshu Ramsay, the 

film?s co-producer. Family will probably be the first film to roll out 

of Big B?s AB Corp.

?All this was so unexpected. The producers called 

me up only day before yesterday, asking me to meet them in Mumbai. After the meeting, 

they wanted to sign me up opposite Aryeman, who is being launched in Family. 

The story revolves around a family and I will play a medical student with whom 

Aryeman falls in love. But I am not supposed to say anything about what Amitabh 

Bachchan plays,? revealed Koel on New Year?s Eve.

Rajkumar Santoshi?s directorial venture reportedly 

finds Big B in a negative shade. The script has been penned by Sridhar Raghavan 

and music scored by Ram Sampat, both of Khakee fame. Though not yet finalised, 

Hema Malini and Sharmila Tagore are being considered for the other female roles.

?I had never even thought of working in Bollywood. 

In fact, I was very content with Tollywood. It?s like a dream,? admitted Koel, 

busy wrapping up shooting for Probhat Roy?s Manik, opposite Jeet.

The year just ended was an action-packed one for Ranjit 

Mullick?s 22-year-old daughter. Koel not only finished with her B.Sc exams, but 

also came up with four Bengali releases in 2004: Shudhu Tumi, Devipaksha, 

Badshah and Bandhan.

From February, Mumbai will be Koel?s karmabhoomi. 

But reigning on home turf is her resolution: ?Tollygunge will definitely remain 

my ground.?

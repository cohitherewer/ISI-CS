 Raising a Potter storm

 Add to the Children rsquo;s Day celebrations by hosting a Harry do, says Riddhima Seal

 Childrens Day, a day full of fun and colour, a day most kids eagerly look forward to, is just around the corner. From celebrations in school to being pampered by parents, the day finds kids in the best of spirits.

 But this year, why not add to it more dollops of fun and call friends over for a little party at home? The theme ? well, every childs favourite, Harry Potter.

 GoodLife gives you a step-by-step guide to make the Potter party come alive. All it needs is some planning and preparation. 

 D?cor drama

 Keeping the theme in mind, you need to transform your entire place into a completely different world ? the world of magic.

 To begin with, paint characters and places from the Harry Potter series on chart papers, cut them out and have them pasted all over, on the walls and the curtains.

 so, keep the bedsheets and cushions in darker shades to enhance that magical effect of the Rowling creations.

 The lights need to be done very carefully as they are easily the most important in a party of this kind.

 Go for low lights of all kinds, as they will add to the mood of magic realism. Put into use all the stand lamps you have.

 You could also get a few hanging lanterns to do up your place. And just below your light shades, place cut-outs of burning torches.

 Skull-shaped candles of various sizes strategically placed could also add to the spooky feel. 

 Bright lights are a complete no-no.

Do 

 Do up the venue with large cutouts of characters from the Harry Potter series

 Create a spooky feel with skull-shaped candles and low lighting

 Hand out wands and witch hats at the door Ask the tiny guests to come dressed as characters from the series 

 Organise games like treasure hunts and musical chairs with names of Hogwarts houses 

Dress diktat

 Just like any other theme party, the idea is to dress up like characters from the Harry Potter series, be it Potter himself, his friends Ron and Hermione, Harrys competitor in school Malfoy, the headmaster Dumbledore or Hagrid, or... 

 And to top it all, you could appoint a tattoo-maker at your door. He or she would be busy painting interesting images of Harry and his exploits wherever your gang wanted.

 You could also place someone at the door to hand out wands and caps with Harry Potter images all over them.

 And do arrange for a little gift for the best-dressed character.

 Games galore

 A party for kids cannot be complete without games. And for a Harry Potter theme party, all you need to do is add a twist to the nature of the games.

 So, a simple treasure hunt could be transformed into a Potter game with twists and turns. You could hide the treasure in a place like the house of Muggles, the Hogwarts School. Drop vital clues with the names of Potter places or things leading you to the treasure.

 ternatively, play a game of musical chairs by arranging chairs with names of different places like Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, Slytherin.

 Food facts

 Finally, turn your attention to the right kind of food and drinks.

 To start at the very end, a platter of mouth-watering desserts is an absolute must. In keeping with the mood of the party, you could order goodies from Kookie Jar or Cakes in the shape of Harry Potter, the Hogwarts School and the like. Throw in lots of chips, prawn crackers, chicken pakoras or paneer tikka to keep the food mood going.

 Instead of regular soft drinks, add a dash of colour to them and give them some interesting-looking stirrers. Name these after potions from the book and see the little ones gulp them down with gusto.

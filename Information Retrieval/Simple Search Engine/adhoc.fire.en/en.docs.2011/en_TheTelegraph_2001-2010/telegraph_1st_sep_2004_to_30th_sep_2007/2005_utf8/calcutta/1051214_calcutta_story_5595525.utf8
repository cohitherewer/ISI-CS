The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Museum lines up science posers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Rave about the theory of relativity or contemplate the consequences of a falling apple. The year that was ? the world year of physics ? was the right year to do so.

 Rounding off the 2005 celebrations in the city, a physics quiz would see participation from schools in eight eastern India states.

 ?It?s the first of its kind physics quiz in India, which will see state champions battle it out at the finals on December 16, in Calcutta,? said Jayanta Sthanapati, director of Birla Industrial and Technology Museum (BITM), which is organising the day-long affair.

 The museum organises a quiz every year on science and technology, for school students in Calcutta and the districts.

 This year, the scale is much larger, with participation from 12 schools in states like Bihar, Orissa, Assam, Nagaland, Mizoram, Sikkim and Meghalaya.

 ?The quiz is open to students of classes XI and XII and would cover all aspects of physics. The 11 rounds will comprise oral and visual questions. Besides, participants will also be quizzed on experiments conducted on the spot,? Sthanapati explained.

 The quiz will include related areas such as astro-physics, geo-physics and bio-physics. The state-level preliminaries got underway in September with written and oral rounds. 

 The line-up for the finals in Calcutta comprises the winner and runner-up from the larger states, and only the winner from the smaller ones.

 The participating schools are scheduled to arrive in the city on December 15. 

 This year, BITM has organised several events to commemorate the year of physics.

 The recently concluded international workshop on demonstrations in physics saw participation from science museums in the US, UK, Australia, Japan and Malaysia.

 ?Through the workshop, we were trying to present various physics phenomena in an entertaining way to different age groups,? Sthanapati said.

 An exhibition on Einstein and the work done after him was put up at the museum in October, while a series of lectures entitled ?Fun with Physics? was held for schoolchildren in August.

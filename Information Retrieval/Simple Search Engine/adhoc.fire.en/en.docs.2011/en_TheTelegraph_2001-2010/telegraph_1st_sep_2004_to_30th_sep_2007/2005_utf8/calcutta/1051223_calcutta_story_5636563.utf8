 Winner voice, laurel list

 If only I could fly down to receive the trophy,? Navojit Mukherjee said wistfully. It was his teacher who had called him up from Swabhumi, late in the evening of December 17, to tell him that he was the Champion of Champions at Sona Chandi The Great TTIS Challenge.

 When the award was announced, most in the audience mistook an exhilarated youngster, screaming and jumping for joy on the dais, for Navojit. ?No, no, I am not Navojit. But we are very proud to accept the award on his behalf,? smiled Sourav Bhanja, the middle-school English teacher, at Methodist School, Dankuni.

 ?I was participating in my school?s annual day function when I got the news. I was ecstatic,? said the Class XI student. Winning the top spot was not exactly a cakewalk for this all-rounder. He had to slog it out, right from the prelims in early December to the finals of War of RJs, Turncoat, Ad Spoof and Antakshari.

 So, what exactly does it take to top a list of over 2,000 participants in the biggest school fest-cum-carnival in the city? ?I am a regular at debates and musical programmes at school. One has to keep trying out different things. Success is sure to come, some day or the other,? pointed out the Tom Cruise and Shah Rukh Khan fan.

 right Remix

 Fancy moves and small-screen stars came together at Xavotsav. The three-day St Xavier rsquo;s College fest culminated with a performance by the cast members of Star One rsquo;s serial Remix (picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya), which had the crowd screaming for more. Xavotsav had 30 colleges from all over the country participating, and creative madness was at its peak. The events that drew the most cheers were Footloose, the western music competition and western dance. Beyond Barriers, which is on Friday, promises to be a fitting end to the festivities.

Beyond Barriers, the annual musical extravaganza organised by St Xavier?s College Calcutta Alumni Association (SXCCAA), in association with The Telegraph, is all set to bring alive the St Xavier?s college grounds on December 23. The event will see Bollywood big names Vasundhara Das and Kunal Ganjawala regaling an expected crowd of 15,000.

 Beyond Barriers, which brings the curtains down on the St Xavier?s College fest, Xavotsav, also has a specific mission. All proceeds from the programme will go towards the St Xavier?s second campus, which is coming up off EM Bypass. ?Beyond Barriers has played a significant role in raising funds for our new, state-of-the-art campus. The funds that the previous shows had generated is proof of the solidarity amongst Xaverians the world over,? said Father P.C. Mathew, president of SXCCAA.

 The alumni association has roped in Xaverian Sourav Ganguly to unveil the plans for the second campus. ?The support we have been receiving for this initiative has been enormous. People from all over the globe have come down or have extended their support to us in myriad ways,? said Imran Zaki Siddiqui, secretary, SXCCAA. The programme will also see local talents Shayne Hyrapiet and Tritha Sinha belting out some popular tracks.

 Over the years, Beyond Barriers has been one of Calcutta?s prominent cultural programmes, besides espousing a number of humanitarian causes. Some of the biggest acts in the country have come down to the city and strutted their stuff on stage ? Strings, Colonial Cousins and even Hari Prasad Chaurasia, just to name a few. The seventh chapter of the programme promises not to disappoint. ?There has been even more interest this year, because of the proposed second campus on the Bypass. We are expecting a huge turnout,? remarked Siddiqui.

 With the right mix of past and future, Beyond Barriers 2005 is all set to be a runaway success.

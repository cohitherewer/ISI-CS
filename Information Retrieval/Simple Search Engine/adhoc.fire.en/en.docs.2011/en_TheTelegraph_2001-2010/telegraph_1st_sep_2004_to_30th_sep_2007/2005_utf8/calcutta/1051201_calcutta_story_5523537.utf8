The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cry against violence on women

 - BONDING FOR safety

 SEBANTI SARKAR

 ?It?s a myth that women are safe in Bengal, recent surveys indicate it ranks 4th in the number of domestic violence cases and incidence of rape in India,? Anuradha Kapoor, founder of Swayam, told Metro on November 25, International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women.

 Swayam, a 10-year-old NGO working on women?s issues, is one of those involved in a 16-day programme ? International Campaign to Stop Violence against Women and Girls ? launched on November 25. 

 Also participating are NGOs like Sanlaap, Sambhabana, Hive India, Saathi, Apne Aap, Association for Women with Disability, Sanchar, Sappho for Equality, Cini Diamond Harbour, Sparsha, School of Human Genetics and Population Health. 

 A series of events ? including seminars, street plays and displays ? are being held in and around Calcutta. Coming up are a poster-making session at Indian Art College and Draftsmanship (December 3) and ?That Takes Ovaries?, an interactive session at Women?s Christian College (December 7).

 ?According to the National Crime Bureau?s record of 2003, Bengal accounts for 10 per cent of all domestic violence across the country. It ranks 7th in dowry deaths (worse than Bihar) and 7th in incest. Bengal ranks a sad 12th on the scale of sexual harassment,? said Kapoor. 

 ?Violence against women has been around for centuries but definitely changes have begun. At least today we are not rebuffed as home-breakers. The veil on the issue is lifting and the silence is breaking as more people talk about it,? said Kapoor. 

 Even the educated and affluent classes are not immune. ?Violence cuts across classes ? the only difference is the higher one goes, more the shame and silence,? said Kapoor.

 Apart from vocational training and counselling, Swayam provides legal support for women to fight their own cases. ?Once the civil law guaranteeing equality becomes operational, women may be more able to counter attacks,? said Kapoor.

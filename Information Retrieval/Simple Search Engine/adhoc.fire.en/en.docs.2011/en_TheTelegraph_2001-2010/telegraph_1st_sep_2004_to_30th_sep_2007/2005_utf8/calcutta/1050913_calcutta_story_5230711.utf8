 Mother, daughter thrashed over deal

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Kanan Das and her daughter Sukla, both in hospital after allegedly being beaten up by goons 

 Samar and Kanan Das had hoped to buy a house with their life?s savings. But a year after paying an advance, Kanan and her daughter Sukla ended up in hospital, allegedly beaten up by criminals in a dispute over the deal.

 Samar Das, 50, a BSNL employee and resident of Basusree Bagan, in the Thakurpukur area, lived in a rented house with his wife and daughter. When they heard that their neighbour Daymanti Roy was planning to sell off her house, the couple approached her. 

 ?She agreed to our proposal and we paid her an advance of Rs 75,000 to buy the single-storey house,? said Kanan.

 However, the deal fell through after a few weeks, prompting Samar and Kanan to seek a refund. 

 According to a complaint lodged with Thakurpukur police station, unidentified men beat up Kanan, 45, and her daughter Sukla, 22, and both had to be hospitalised. 

 ?We are trying to verify allegations about Daymanti Roy having second thoughts over selling the house to Samar Das, and planning to sell it to a promoter instead. This might have led to the dispute,? said S.N. Gupta, superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas).

 In December, Samar Das paid the advance and Daymanti Roy had agreed to vacate the house as early as possible and get it registered in the former?s name by early 2005. 

 According to the police complaint, Roy later claimed that the process was getting delayed as an old tenant was refusing to vacate the house. 

 The Das family continued to pursue the matter, police said. ?After waiting a few weeks more, they asked Roy to return the advance,? said superintendent Gupta.

 When Roy did not do that, Samar sought the help of Rumki Chakraborty, a social worker who, in turn, took up the issue with local political leaders. 

 ?I met everybody concerned and told them that if Roy could not sell the property now, she should return the money,? said Chakraborty.

 On Saturday evening, Kanan alleged in her complaint, Daymanti and three persons suddenly dropped by. ?Daymanti was accompanied by a few men, who started beating up my daughter and me.? 

 But Daymanti?s son, Rahul, claimed they were always willing to return the money. 

 ?My mother did go to Samar Das?s house to tell him that she would return the money soon. But Kanan and some other persons attacked my mother and those who accompanied her. I took her to a doctor for treatment. She is in a state of shock and will not be able to speak to anybody,? said Rahul. 

 Superintendent Gupta said he has asked both parties to meet him on Tuesday to settle the matter.

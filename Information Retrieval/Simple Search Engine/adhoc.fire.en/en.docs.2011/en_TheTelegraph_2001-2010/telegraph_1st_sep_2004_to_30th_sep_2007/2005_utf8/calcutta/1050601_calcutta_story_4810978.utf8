 Colonel Sanders original recipe chicken made with a secret blend of 11 herbs and spices, is a closely guarded secret to this day, locked away in a safe in Louisville, Kentucky. From the 1930s, the legend of KFC has grown from one small restaurant in Corbin, Kentucky, to more than 12,300 outlets in more than 80 countries.

 And Calcutta is gearing up to tuck into its wide range of chicken-based products soon. KFCs much-awaited city stop ? a 70-seater restaurant in Salt Lakes City Centre ? is slated for a mid-June opening, and will mark the chains maiden foray into eastern India.

 Sharanita Keswani, director, KFC Marketing, Yum! Restaurants International, says: Our endeavour is to put a Yum! on every face and customers can look forward to some mouth-watering times at KFC.

 Calcuttans will be able to choose from a host of options on the menu that includes a selection of Chicken on the Bone, trademark KFC burgers, wraps, strips, vegetarian side dishes like spicy curry, pepper rice, fresh green salads and coleslaw, besides chicken and vegetarian thalis. The all-new dessert island will have a spread of sundaes and other sumptuous sweet endings.

 Besides offering a range of finger-licking and mouth-watering proprietary chicken products, KFC will serve a wide range of vegetarian products, promises Keswani. KFC will operate the city restaurant through franchisee Devyani International, also the franchisee for sister concern Pizza Hut in north and east India. 

 The chain also promises to bring to India its internationally benchmarked operations and procedures, training and best practices. With our maniacal focus on customer delight, we aspire to set new standards of service in the Calcutta market, Keswani adds.

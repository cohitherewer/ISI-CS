 With 48 hours to go for the crucial second Test, Team Pakistan members geared up in style on Monday. If the morning opened with a serious practice session at the Eden Gardens, the rest of the day ranged from hair-do to do-good, food feast to shopping lists.

 Post-practice, Shahid Afridi, Abdul Razzak (with wife Ayesha, daughter Amna and son Faad) and Arshad Khan headed for what the flamboyant Afridi described as ?his favourite salon? ? Eyecatchers, on Wood Street.

 Salman Butt, Kamran Akmal and ex-captain Aamir Sohail trooped into Starstruck, at Forum, for a Mughlai meal. Kadai Murg, Fish Tikka and naan were followed by a diet drink and rounded off with chocolate mousse, butterscotch and chocolate ice-creams.

 ?I don?t go out too much in Pakistan, it?s always easy to get these luxury treatments done in India,? admitted Afridi, getting his hair touched up with blonde streaks. Spinner Arshad decided to pamper himself with a hair wash and massage, but confessed: ?I have two sons and it?s their age to indulge in fashion. This is a one-off thing for me.?

 All-rounder Razzak was more copybook, sticking to a simple haircut and some styling with hair gel, before playing daddy to his two little ones, as wife Ayesha tried layers on her hair. On her maiden visit to the city, Ayesha was all excited about taking home a treasure trove of saris and jewellery. ?I intend to shop for saris, jewellery and shoes here,? she smiled. Ayesha could have Afridi for company, for the flamboyant all-rounder was keen to go sari shopping (?saris and shoes in Calcutta are very good. I intend buying some for my wife?).

 A bid to shop in Pantaloons had to be aborted as the crowds went crazy, so the gang picked Pizza Hut, also at 22, Camac Street, to polish off lunch.

 From chomp to charity. A consortium of Calcuttans and organisations like Rotary Clubs and Calcutta Foundation held an auction at Taj Bengal on Monday evening, to raise money for tsunami survivors in the Andamans. So it was time for CATS (Cricketers in Action for Tsunami Survivors), as the entire Pakistani team and a few Indian cricketers turned up.

 A T-shirt worn by Salman Butt went for Rs 15,000, a bat signed by the Pakistani team went for Rs 35,000. A bat signed by team members and given away by Afridi went for Rs 25,000. Another bat signed by both the Indian and Pakistani players was auctioned for Rs 65,000. A ball signed by Balaji and Harbhajan went for Rs 26,000, a T-shirt belonging to and signed by Irfan Pathan, as well as a ball autographed by him were given away by Usha Uthup for Rs 25,000. Finally, a pair of gloves autographed by Inzamam-ul-Haq, Afridi and some Indian players was auctioned for Rs 16,000.

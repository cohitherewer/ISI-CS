 20 years for clean water

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Taking the judges by surprise, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s government declared with a straight face on Friday that it required another 20 years to ensure that Calcutta and the rest of Bengal received quality drinking water.

 Following an earlier directive of Calcutta High Court, the government on Friday filed a report on the status of drinking water. 

 In the report, the government said it had undertaken schemes to supply pure drinking water across the state, including Calcutta, where the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) is responsible. 

 The plan will be implemented in 2025, government pleader Rabilal Maitra told the division bench, comprising Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice A.K. Ganguly.

 The judges expressed their surprise at the government?s statement. ?The country won its independence in 1947. Since then, 58 years have passed. Now your government says it needs 20 more years to provide pure drinking water to people!? the bench exclaimed. 

 The court asked the government, its public health engineering department, the CMC and Howrah Municipal Corporation to file an affidavit about the details of the pure-water schemes. 

 ?Inform us about the process undertaken by you to make the water bacteria-free. Also, let us know whether samples are collected from every locality and what have been the results of the tests,? the court observed. 

 It directed establishments with water reservoirs to be kept under strict vigil. 

 The judges asked the government and the civic authorities to regularly check whether these establishments were properly storing water, and whether or not the water was getting contaminated while it was being supplied from the reservoir. The case was initiated by environment activist Subhas Dutta.

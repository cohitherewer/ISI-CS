Culinary crossover

Kitchen Caper

Nisha Lahiri takes the lid off Atriums 

mix-and-match menu and explores the innovations behind the fusion flavours

Norwegian salmon with masala mashed potatoes, pasta 

with aubergine stew, Thai marinations cooked in the tandoor, Indian naan 

with Moroccan spices? A mix and match ? literally ? of world cuisine is the 

mouth-watering menu at Atrium, summed up in a sentence. 

Try pleasing the mostly traditional palate of a Calcuttan 

24x7, and it?s guaranteed to be a test of taste and time. So says Shaun Kenworthy, 

executive chef, The Park (picture above). ?If you ask 50 different people to cook 

yellow dal, each one will be different.?

The Britisher does what he can to keep the customers 

happy at the round-the-clock coffee shop of the Park Street hotel. Of course, 

it does help that the food comes in gigantic proportions at ?high street prices?. 

The USP of this restaurant is the changing menu, with constant innovations and 

improvisations to come up with not just fusion food, but ?modern Indian and international 

cuisine?. 

Experimentation might not always work, and certainly 

not with everyone. But it?s the motto of ?something for everyone? that Shaun feeds 

of. So, while the rabbit was short-lived, he bounced back with naan cooked 

with curry leaves and coconut to go with a south Indian dish, salmon in tomato 

gravy and pasta with a sauce containing cumin, coriander, mint and garlic.

?Indian cuisine hasn?t really changed in the past 

200 years. There are lots of different spices and ingredients available now, which 

can be used in many ways. For instance, sambar has a lot of vegetables 

in it, but no one really likes it with zucchini and babycorn. I love playing around, 

though, particularly with kebabs. In a coffee shop, you have more room to do so. 

In fact, I use the tandoor for a lot of different things, from Thai lobster 

to Portuguese chicken,? says he.

The ingredients pour in from around the world all 

through the day, starting at 6.30 am and going right up till 8 pm. First up are 

the breakfast breads and confectioneries (now it?s all from Flurys), followed 

by meats, spices and other items from various places, and ending with English 

vegetables like red capsicum and zucchini from Bangalore.

There?s a little bit of almost every country?s culinary 

culture in Atrium?s small but busy kitchen. Smoked duck from France, New Zealand 

lamb from the sheep country, Italian cheese (ordered two weeks in advance) and 

Norwegian salmon from Scandinavia are a few of the delicious delights. There?s 

a dish or two of Spanish and Mexican origins, a Portuguese offering and much more. 

Indian, Thai and Chinese cannot be ignored by any 

restaurant in Calcutta, but even these are cooked with a quirky twist to infuse 

them with unique flavours. Like paratha with zatar, a Moroccan spice, 

pasta sauces that have a tinge of curry taste and Thai dishes with a whiff of 

tandoor. 

The Tenderloin Steak and Pork Chops are high on the 

list of top five items at Atrium ? ?partly because they are not really available 

in most other places? ? as are Fish ?? Chips and sandwiches. But there?s an interesting 

story behind even this mundane menu: ?The pork?s local. There?s a lady a little 

outside Calcutta who breeds Suffolk pigs. I buy from her.?

And then there are the food festivals. Last year, 

they encompassed a whole range of world cuisine, with the spicy aromas of Mauritian 

munchies, the tangy taste of North Indian chaats and a retro tribute to 

Park Street food fare with the Prawn Cocktail festival to name a few. But there?s 

more in store, with plans for a Moroccan/Leba-nese festival soon.

This is a kitchen that never sleeps, much like the 

people who come here to eat, drink and be merry. So it?s in a constant state of 

mise en place (the process of preparation). The bulk preparation, like 

cooking pasta sauces, marinating and putting together the ingredients, is done 

in the lean times ? between breakfast-lunch and dinner-breakfast. The pantry prepares 

bread and fresh juices through the day, while the starter section does the snacks 

and appetisers. 

The kitchen is also a study in cultural crossovers, 

with a Thai chef, an Indian chef, an Italian-trained chef and other temporary 

taste-masters stirring up storms for the food festivals. Each one picks up tips 

from the other, fusing together elements to excite the senses as much as keep 

hungry tummies happy. 

?Indians are the hardest to cook for. They are stubbornly 

set against change. And the customer here is very much the king. If he wants it 

done some way, we do it. Only about five per cent experiments. But if you?re bothering 

to go out, then you might as well eat something new,? signs off Shaun.

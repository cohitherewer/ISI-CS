The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Trucks clog port pathway

 Goods vehicles in a traffic snarl on Circular Garden Reach Road. A Telegraph picture

S.K. Mainul: Commuting along Circular Garden Reach Road has become a nightmare. There is always a traffic snarl on the road at any time of the day. Have you thought of a way to improve the situation?

 Since the road is adjacent to the port, it is clogged by heavy vehicles. Earlier, there were railway tracks leading to the port and goods used to be ferried by trains. Now, the goods are transported exclusively by heavy trucks and trailers, which cause traffic snarls on Circular Garden Reach Road.

 The situation is so deplorable that even ambulances have to remain stranded for a long time. To protest the state of affairs, we organised a bandh on August 25. Several rounds of discussions have been held on the problem, but no solution has so far emerged.

 Chairman of Calcutta Port Trust Anup Chanda has taken the initiative and arranged for central funds to widen the road with the help of the public works department. But the situation is unlikely to improve much as there are no parking lots in the area. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation is looking into the problem.

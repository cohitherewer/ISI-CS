 The menu at La Terrasse, the multi-cuisine restaurant at The Oberoi Grand, wears a whole new look with value additions in all sections. The All New Menu, as the restaurant chooses to call the makeover, dishes out lavish spreads for breakfast, lunch and dinner, with world cuisine being the focus.

 For appetisers and salads, there are Haloumi Zucchini and Bell Pepper Stack with Balsamic Dressing, Saut?ed Scallop, Lemon-infused Bekti and King Prawns with Saffron Butter Emulsion, and a host of other inviting dishes.The soup section is varied, with Roast Pumpkin Soup with Goat Cheese Ravioli and Chicken Noodle Soup with Pakchoi and Ginkgo Nuts being the chefs choice. 

 Interesting options in the main course include Steamed Pomfret Fillet and Mussels in Miso Broth, and Grilled Polenta with Asparagus. 

 Indian delicacies include Galouti Kebab (minced lamb kebab with Awadhi spices) and Dakshina Yera Varuval (prawns stir fried with curry leaves, mustard seeds, onion and green peppercorn).

 Moving on to the sinful desserts, a range of home-made ice cream offers sheer delights like Dark Chocolate and Macadamia Nut, Banana and Passion Fruit Sorbet and Tropical Fresh Fruit Platter with Banana Bread and Honey Yoghurt. Also on offer are malpoa, tarts, cakes and pancakes.

 The buffet menu varies each day with dinner being a hearty display of soups, salads, desserts and on-site options. Lunch at La Terrasse is fun with live counters for pastas, pizzas, dosas, grills and omlettes, says executive chef George K. George.

 Pre-tax prices of the buffet are Rs 390, Rs 625 and Rs 525 for breakfast, lunch and dinner respectively. 

 Grilled grub

 No matter how you spell them, the kebab should taste its usual delicious self. For more of this skewered meat delicacy, head to 5, Camac Street, where the name of the shop might be Kebebs but the offering is worth a try. 

 The 18-covers restaurant looks more like a coffee shop, but serves a variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian kebabs. The vegetarian section includes Paneer Achari Tikka (spicy marinated Indian grilled cheese), Aloo Bharwan (potatoes stuffed with fresh cheese marinated in yoghurt and grilled), Makai da Jawab (prepared with fresh babycorn and Indian herbs).

 The non-vegetarian fare offers favourites like Murgh Hariyali Kebab (boneless pieces of chicken marinated in yoghurt and ground masala and flavoured with coriander leaves), Kadai Murgh (boneless pieces of chicken cooked with pepper), Makhan Murgh (leg pieces of chicken cooked in rich gravy), Gosht Roganjosh and Reshmi Murgh Tikka.

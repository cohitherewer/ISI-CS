 Buddha block bays for bookie blood

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Organised satta (gambling) gangs appear to be flourishing in the Karaya area, especially near the Palm Avenue residence of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.

 The area falls under the constituency of Trinamul Congress chairperson Mamata Banerjee. 

 According to reports, the satta bookies operate under the patronage of a section of local police officers.

 Unhappy with the role that Karaya police station has been playing in controlling the gangs, local residents have sent a written complaint to the chief minister and state government officials. 

 In the letter, the complainants have described how the police-bookie nexus operates.

 ?It is a matter of serious regret that criminals are operating satta in collaboration with Karaya police station personnel. Hundreds of complaints have failed to attract the attention of the police. It simply shows the callousness of your department,? states the letter, addressed to commissioner of police Prasun Mukherjee. 

 ?Finding no other way to seek redress, we, the local people, beg you to take some urgent steps in this regard and arrest the culprits. If you pay heed to our complaint, we shall be grateful,? the residents signed off in the letter.

 Reacting to the allegations, Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (south division), said: ?The local police station has been asked to collect information about those involved in the satta racket. A special drive will be initiated very soon.? 

 He added that it would be verified whether the local police personnel have links with the bookies.

 ?Karaya police station is appeased by a broker named Akhtar, who lives in Tiljala?s Shibtala Lane. Akhtar pays Rs 3,000 per week to officials of Karaya thana and it has become a regular practice,? the complaint elaborates.

 The letter goes on to mention the names of the bookies allegedly working in collusion with police: ?They are Chotka (one eye damaged), Feroz, Imtiaz, Daiyum, Gandhi and Noora. Pencillers like Rafique, Mumtaz, Jahangir, Alam and Bippo are seen writing satta pads every day near the Shiv temple in Shibtala Lane.?

 Javed Khan, mayoral council member (slum development), said: ?I have informed the police several times about the problem. They know everything, but have not done anything in several years.?

 The local residents have also alleged that the bookies indulge in other anti-social activities in the area.

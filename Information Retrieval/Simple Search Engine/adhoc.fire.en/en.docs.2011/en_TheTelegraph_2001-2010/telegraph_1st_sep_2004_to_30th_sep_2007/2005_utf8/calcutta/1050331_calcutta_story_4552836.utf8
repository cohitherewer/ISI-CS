Behind the Bar

Nothing quenches thirst on a summer evening better 

than some super cooler cocktails. Usually, I have seen that vodka-based cocktails 

are most popular during summer in Calcutta. But of late people have started drinking 

a lot of whiskey-based cocktails too. 

Whatever the base, the other ingredients should be 

added keeping the scorching heat in mind. It?s important that these leave you 

with a cool and fresh feeling. 

A lot of lemonade and other fresh fruit juices lend 

that refreshing feeling to a cocktail and also add sweetness, which goes down 

quite well with Calcuttans. There are some herbs, too, like basil leaves and coriander 

leaves that make you feel fresh. These can be used as garnish as well as blended 

into a cocktail. 

Fruit slices used for garnish make a drink look very 

cool and hence appeal visually during summer.

 I have provided three recipes of cocktails that are 

ideal for the summer. Two of them are vodka-based and one whiskey-based.

Summer Cooler

Ingredient: vodka 60 ml; Peach Schnapps 30 

ml; tonic water 150 ml; a dash of red wine; cucumber slices.

Method: Mix the vodka, Peach Schnapps and tonic 

water in a glass. Add a dash of red wine. Garnish with a slice of cucumber and 

serve chilled.

Hot pants on the rocks

Ingredients: vodka 30 ml; tequila 30 ml; orange 

juice 100 ml; pineapple juice 100 ml; fresh lime juice 30 ml and a dash of grenadine.

Method: Pour the vodka along with all the fresh 

juices in a cocktail glass over lots of ice cubes. Add a tinge of grenadine and 

serve on the rocks.

Whiskey Mac

Ingredients: whiskey 60 ml; soda; lemonade; 

basil leaves and coriander leaves.

Method: Blend the whiskey with fresh basil 

leaves and coriander leaves and pour in a glass. Top it up with soda and lemonade 

in equal proportions. Garnish with basil leaves and serve chilled.

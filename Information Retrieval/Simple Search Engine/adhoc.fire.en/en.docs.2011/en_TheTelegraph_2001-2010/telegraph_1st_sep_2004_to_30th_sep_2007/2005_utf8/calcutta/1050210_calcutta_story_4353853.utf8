 Bumpy ride, plus phone facility

 - CSTC, CALTEL INSTAL PUBLIC CALL BOOTH ON FIVE STATE BUSES

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The Calcutta State Transport Corporation (CSTC) is known to spend resources and energy on unproductive ventures. 

 That was once more in evidence on Tuesday evening, when state transport minister Subhas Chakraborty inaugurated five CSTC buses with public call offices (PCO).

 At a time when most Calcuttans carry mobile phones, the move drew flak from commuters. 

 ?It would have been of more benefit if the CSTC concentrated on repairing dilapidated buses and ensuring passenger comfort and safety,? said Amit Singha, who commutes daily by bus from Jadavpur to BBD Bag.

 The five buses have been equipped with wireless in local loop (WLL) handsets and call monitors, in a joint venture between CSTC and Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd-Calcutta Telephones (BSNL-CalTel). 

 ?This is nothing short of a visionary endeavour. If the project is successful, we will consider extending the facility,? the transport minister said during the inauguration.

 ?The mobile PCO service is being started on an experimental basis. We have paid Rs 1,000 for the registration of each bus and Rs 500 per month per unit as service charge. BSNL will get 75 per cent of the profit,? said CSTC managing director Askoke Bhattacharyya.

 ?Passengers will be able to make local calls only, and the buses will ply in the areas under the jurisdiction of CalTel. The service will be beneficial to those who don?t use mobile phones, especially in emergency situations,? he added.

 According to Bhattacharyya, a formal review of the service will be conducted after six months, before it is decided whether the service should be extended on a commercial basis.

 Sarada Prasad Chakraborty, chief general manager of BSNL-CalTel, explained that wireless mobile services make use of CDMA and GSM technologies. 

 ?The WLL mobile phone uses CDMA technology and has an antenna that receives radio signals, with the main instrument fixed to the console. A computerised charge slip will be handed to the user after a call is made,? he said. The units will be housed on the left of the bus doors and will have foam pads on the sides for protection. A CSTC official will tend to the mobile booths and spot reviews will be made after 15-day intervals.

 Sutanu Lal Chakraborty, deputy managing director of CSTC, said that the project aimed to make the travel experience a unique one.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 ?Just formula item songs with our touch?

 After creating magic in the background for blockbusters like Bhoot and Dhoom, music directors SALIM and SULAIMAN are rocking big time with their ldquo;first commercial soundtrack rdquo;, Kaal. The talented twosome talks to Pratim D. Gupta about all the musical dhamaal

 Shah Rukh Khan and Malaika Arora Khan perform the Kaal dhamaal number

 Aren?t you a very unlikely choice for a Karan Johar film?

 Then, Kaal isn?t exactly a typical Karan Johar film. We were very excited when we got the offer. Can?t really say that we were on top of the world but we did realise that it was the right time to showcase ourselves and our music to the audience. It was an opportunity and to be honest, such opportunities don?t come often. So, it was a great moment for us, to be able to bring to our listeners our own form of Bollywood music ? what Bollywood is to us.

 So, that way Kaal is your first real film soundtrack?

 Yes, you can say that. We did songs for Bhoot, for Darna Mana Hai and of course, loads of background scores for everything from Dhoom to Hum Tum to Ab Tak Chhappan. But you can actually call Kaal our first commercial release. 

 Salim-Sulaiman

 It was supposed to be a songless thriller?

 Yes. At first, we were involved just for the background score. Then (director) Soham and later Karan asked us to do two main songs, one background song and a couple of theme songs. And the songs couldn?t have had any effect on the theme since they were more or less outside the movie. Kaal dhamaal was the title track for the film which comes with the opening credits, more of a packaging exercise with Shah Rukh and Malaika. And Tauba tauba comes with the end credits. So they are more like proper OST songs meant to start and finish the film.

 Would you call the two songs item numbers turned into videos?

 We were briefed to make commercial hits. Karan wanted the songs to be played all over the country. So they are more like formula item songs. What we did was put ourselves in it and try and make them sound interesting. Doing songs like that is a done thing ? adding commercial flavours to the tracks. The challenge was to try out different things within the generic format. So, in Tauba tauba, we gave a qawwali twist with hip-hop beats and Kaal dhamaal was more of a pop song with rap-rock influences? Just our touch to two commercial songs.

 And what about the background score, which is your forte?

 The background score of Kaal is very tribal with lots of jungle flavours, interesting jungle flutes, voices of African tribes and even Indian shlokas. In fact it is the shlokas which give a unique texture to the Kaal score. We have used the Mrityunjay mantra at many places in the film. It is usually chanted at the time of death. The word Kaal means time and also death. So the mix of tribal sounds and Indian mantras make for very interesting listening.

 You have also used lots of Punjabi sounds. Is that an effort to reach the disc consoles?

 These days Punjabi music is getting international recognition. It is getting popular all over. So they weren?t forced or anything, just the current flavour of the season.

 Tribal chants rule the background score of Kaal, starring Vivek Oberoi, Ajay Devgan and John Abraham 

 Your music in Manish Jha?s Matrubhoomi is also creating waves in the festival circuit?

 Matrubhoomi will present a completely different Salim-Sulaiman to everyone. It is a very, very powerful film. Both of us were really touched when we saw the film. The music in Matrubhoomi is a blend of orchestra and rural colours ? lots of north Indian flavours. It?s our touch to different traditions. Such projects keep us going.

 What?s next from you two?

 Having done the background score for Hum Tum, this time we are doing the complete soundtrack for a Yash Raj film, to be directed by Arjun Sablok and starring Uday Chopra and Tanishaa. We are also doing loads of background scores of which two are out-and-out comedies, David Dhawan?s Maine Pyar Kyun Kiya and Boney Kapoor?s No Entry. Then there?s the Saif Ali Khan-Naseeruddin Shah starrer Being Cyrus and Urmila Matondkar?s new film Naina. We are also working individually on some underground music, collaborating with the biggest names in international music.

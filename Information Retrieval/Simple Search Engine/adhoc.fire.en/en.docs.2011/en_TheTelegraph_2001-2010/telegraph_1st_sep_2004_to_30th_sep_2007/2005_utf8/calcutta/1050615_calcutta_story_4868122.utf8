The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 School buses fined

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 In a morning raid on the Howrah end of Vidyasagar Setu on Tuesday, officials of the Howrah Motor Vehicles fined two buses and four minibuses that ferry students of city schools. 

 The six vehicles, none of which had permits, were among the 15 fined or impounded during the raid.

 Howrah?s Regional Transport Officer (RTO) Sukumar Dutta expressed concern about the way city schools were using buses without permits.

 ?During the raid, we found that two buses and four minibuses, that ferried students of some renowned south Calcutta schools, did not have valid papers. If any of these vehicles meet with an accident, insurance companies won?t pay a paisa to the victims,? RTO Dutta pointed out.

 ?Parents and school authorities should be aware of the grave risks they are putting the students in,? he added.

 Four government cars were also among the vehicles fined or impounded. Three of them belong to the public health engineering department, while the other is from the South 24-Parganas zilla parishad.

 ?The government cars didn?t have permits and were evading taxes,? Dutta stated. ?Two four-wheelers, including a government Ambassador, were impounded, while the other vehicles were fined.?

 The RTO complained that several cars of the Central and state governments were illegally transporting passengers. 

 ?The government drivers also use the beacon to evade toll tax while crossing Vidyasagar Setu,? he alleged.

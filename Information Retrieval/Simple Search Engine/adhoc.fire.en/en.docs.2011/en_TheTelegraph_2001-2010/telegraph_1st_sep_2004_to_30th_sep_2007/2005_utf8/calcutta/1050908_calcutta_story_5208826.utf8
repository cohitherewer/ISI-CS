 Lakbir - Mixologist, Gossip, the restopub at Udita

 Gossip, the recently-opened restopub at Udita, hosted a Cocktail Night on September 2, where we showcased our wide repertoire of concoctions. The list included our very own Barmans Specials, apart from the other regular offerings. 

 Our cocktail menu is split into several sections ? A Sudden Attack, Club Cocktail, Traditional Drinks and Temptation. 

 The Sudden Attack section offers cocktails like the B53 Bomber Shooters and Brain Haemorrhage. Our Club Cocktail includes Angel, Coco Jumbo, Sex on the Beach and Sunrise. There are the usual Temptations of Bloody Mary, Screw Driver, Gimlet, Tom Collins, Planters Punch, Daiquiri and Brandy Toddy. Add to this the traditional drinks like Mai Tai, Long Island Ice Tea, Blue Lagoon, Manhattan Martini and Negroni.

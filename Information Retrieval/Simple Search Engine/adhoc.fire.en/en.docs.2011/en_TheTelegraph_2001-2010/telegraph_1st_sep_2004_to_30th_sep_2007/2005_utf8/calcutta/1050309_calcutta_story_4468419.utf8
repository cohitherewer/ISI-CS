 Bigger show for infotech

 A STAFF REPORTER

 More participants, more exhibit area and a bigger push to Bengal?s information and technology movement. 

 These are the promises from Compass 2005, the annual IT exhibition organised by Computer Association of Eastern India (Compass).

 The event, in its 10th year ? second successive year on the Maidan ? will be held between March 11 and 15. ?Compared to last year?s 300 stalls, we will have 370 stalls this year,? said Neeraj Agrawal, secretary of Compass. The exhibition will cover 2,200 sq m, against 1,800 sq m in 2004.

 Most hardware and software majors are likely to be there at Compass 2005. The list includes Microsoft, Seagate, Intel, AMD, Via Technologies, Canon, HP, Sony and more. 

 ?Tally, the accounting software, will present its value-added tax (VAT) compliant version at the fair, and Dataquest magazine will launch its weekly newspaper DQWeek in the east,? said Agrawal.

 On the hardware front, Syntech Group of Companies is scheduled to unveil its Isyn brand of PCs and laptops.

 According to Agrawal, VAT will help computer sales grow ?five to 10-fold? in the near future, owing to more computer usage. 

 At Compass 2005, the organisers are expecting better business than last year. 

 ?We had business worth Rs 20 crore last time and expect the figure to touch Rs 30 crore this year,? Compass president N. Dhanuka added.

 Award Net, a recognition of best brands, will crown winners in categories like best PC, best software and best channel partner. A regular feature of Compass, the awards will include consumer feedback for the first time this year.

 Compass is also trying to set up an interaction through video conferencing with free software champion Richard Stallman. ?We haven?t received a confirmation from him yet, but we are trying our best to have him at the fair,? Agrawal added.

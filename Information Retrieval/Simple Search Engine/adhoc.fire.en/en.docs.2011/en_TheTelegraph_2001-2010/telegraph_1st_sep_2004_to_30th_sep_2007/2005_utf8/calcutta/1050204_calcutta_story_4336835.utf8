The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Of life and laughter 

February 1 and 2 saw Madhusudan Mancha come alive with 

gleeful chatter from young ones. Juggling, dance, art and craft ? some of the 

activities at Ikri Mikri, a fair. 

 It?s a three-day Festival of Fairy Tales 

for the tiny tots of Kangaroo Kids. Thursday was a special treat, with actress 

June joining in the masti. Picture by Pradip Sanyal

Vikramshila Education Resource Society (VERS) celebrated 

15 years of its work through the fair. Participating were children from the Nabadisha 

project jointly administered by Calcutta Police and VERS. Beneath the merriment 

was a serious note. The highlight of the two-day mela was a play, written and 

performed by the children from the schools run by VERS in Cossipore, Bowbazar 

and Lake Thana. 

It was based on a script which had evolved through 

workshops with Debshankar Haldar of Nandikar. ?We held workshops. Through story-telling 

sessions, I tried to understand what the children would like to work on. They 

wanted to do something based on their own experiences,? explains Haldar. 

?We were asked what had touched us most in recent 

times. It was the tsunami,? says Swarupa Mondol, from the Nabadisha school near 

Lake Thana. The play explores the friendship that springs up between Munni, a 

girl from a slum, and Jhimli, a girl from a neighbouring highrise. Their friendship 

is frowned upon by Jhimli?s mother. Munni is then forced to move away as she is 

evicted. 

She moves to Andaman with her family. It is here that 

she meets Jhimli again. The town is struck by the tsunami. Munni saves Jhimli?s 

life. The play ends with a reversal of fortunes, where nature makes both families 

equal. Jhimli?s family is left as hungry and miserable as any other. ?We hear 

of so many people left homeless for various reasons. When they ask for help, people 

tend to shoo them away. We wanted to tell people to avoid being selfish and think 

about everyone?s plight,? says Madhumita Naskar.

Something these youngsters know well. The children 

of the Lake Thana school live under the constant threat of eviction. Their homes 

are the shanties that line either side of the railway line near Dhakuria station. 

?We understood the children?s trauma. We felt the need for a creative outlet which 

would have therapeutic value,? explains Bhasvati Nag of VERS. 

Three-year-old Amrita sums it up: ?I like dressing 

up and acting. I like the claps I get at the end for talking on stage,? she giggles.

VERS, an organisation funded by CRY, has been using 

its volunteers to help the children develop their skills, both academic and otherwise. 

While students from Jadavpur University and Loreto College tutor those who have 

gone on to formal schools like Future Hope, there is also a volunteer from NUJS 

conducting classes in elementary Bharatanatyam. 

Swarupa is a Class III student of Future Hope, with 

a keen interest in academics and extracurriculars. ?My mother was very encouraging 

about acting. She says maybe I?ll make it to TV serials one day,? beams Swarupa. 

But she sobers up when speaking of the eviction. ?How do I know I?ll be able to 

continue with all these things if I have to move away?? 

Srabanti Basak, a teacher, adds: ?What disturbs the 

children is the sudden break up of a community.?

WHats on your mind this week

Sibyl

I am one of those

Who could squat by the tracks

Bundled in dulled rag chadar,

Lost to reality ?

While Time grates by,

The world clamouring to be on board ?

Wrinkled cataracted eyes

Hardly bothering to blink at this hulla,

Dead brown skin expressionless, numb.

Would it be unnatural to do so?

Her Diary

It was early in the morning,

The sun woke without a warning! 

She swept the room and she wiped the floor, 

She made the tea and opened the door. 

She rubbed the greasy pots and pans 

And fetched the heavy milk-cans. 

Her legs ached and her head throbbed, 

And yet her leisure had been robbed 

To cook eggs for the breakfast 

And water the plants from a jar with rust. 

She was a girl from the village with a long braid, 

The city folk really needed a maid. 

Her dreams often put her in a school, 

But she is only a fool! 

She wishes to paint with colours bright 

And sleep on a soft bed in the night 

She yearns for a paper and a pen 

God bless her; she is only ten!

Stampede

(Based on the stampede at mandhardevi temple) 

When the seas failed to take me,

Myriad feet upon the marble almost did. 

Indebted to the celestial power 

For sparing my earthly life, 

I prayed. 

How could He then subject me,

To such a contingency? 

Countless philistine beings. 

Jolted suddenly out of their oblivion, 

Rushed over my tender self. 

Can I forget that moment of agony? 

Oh! I cried with those I saw crying. 

Mothers with their tender ones lay 

About me lifeless. 

Many dying every minute, 

upon the cold marble. 

My own self racking, 

my soul shattered, 

Refusing to depart. 

God still had use of me.

Asta...

Play with Building Blocks... 

And so the carriage grinds the night 

And the insect crackles in the embers 

Within the hollows of the boat 

Asta will you come home in the evening? 

The last drops of the lemon 

In the forehead 

Spells out the murderer?s name 

Who flew in like a bat 

In the midst of the night 

and tore your wheels 

While you shut yourself 

In the hollow of a tree 

And thought of God 

and smelt the tears 

Of the dear that ran by the lake

To the gates of the garden 

Asta will you go to the bees? 

You too heard the song of the dust 

As it drowned your bells 

and the mother?s prayer 

But the lonely lunatic 

Who crawled up the drains 

And threw his eyeballs at your feet 

Still fondles the nerves from his forehead 

In the fist of his hand 

Asta will you stop crying?

2005

The two-day fest of the Institute of Technology and 

Marine Engineering (ITME) held in association with The Telegraph, was an event 

to showcase talents. Day One started off with an innovative antakshari, 

where participants were judged for their singing, acting and dancing skills, by 

none other than the audience.

The choreography competition ensured everybody shook 

a leg, on and off stage. The main attraction of the day was kept for the last. 

Krosswindz, Lakkhichhara and Fossils rocked the evening. Tomay Dilam, a 

tribute to Gautam Chattopadhay, the father of Bangla rock, was the theme.

Day Two started off with a creative quiz, where participants 

were judged on general knowledge, reasoning and creativity. Next was the band 

competition. Participants were permitted two songs only. A special western dance 

performance by the students of the host college livened up the atmosphere. The 

final event was Bangladeshi rock band Miles rocking the campus.

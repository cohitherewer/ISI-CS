The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Protest barrage against practice bar

 - Doctors line up rallies to focus on Act amendment, quacks 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 After squatting on the footpath, the doctors have decided to stall traffic on April 30 by organising rallies across the city to protest the government?s decision to stop medical practice in pharmacies.

 On April 1, doctors owing allegiance to the Calcutta branch of Indian Medical Association (IMA) had attended to the ailing on a footpath at Raja Subodh Mullick Square to mock the government decision.

 ?Where will the doctors go if they are not allowed to practise in pharmacies? We will now take our campaign to the people,? warned Sudipto Roy, IMA national president-elect.

 The IMA has embarked upon a signature-collection drive to create public opinion on the bar. ?Once the signature collection is over by mid-April, we will start a bigger campaign in the form of public rallies in the city. The first rally will be held on April 30 near Metro cinema,? R.D. Dubey, IMA joint secretary (headquarters), said on Thursday.

 The IMA has also questioned the government?s lack of initiative in stopping quacks from practising in the city.

 A few years ago, quacks, holding false medical certificate, practised predominantly in the districts. More and more quacks are now moving to the city, especially in pockets of Rajabazar, Mullickbazar, Beleghata and other parts of central and south Calcutta.

 ?Instead of stepping up the campaign against quacks, the government is after qualified doctors, which is extremely unfortunate,? lamented Dubey.

 On April 30, the doctors will raise their voice against another government move ?asking them to re-register with the health department.

 Earlier, the doctors did not need permission from the states after obtaining a registration number from the Medical Council of India. 

 The government, however, has made re-registration mandatory. 

 The health department announced on Thursday that it is determined to stop doctors from practising in pharmacies.

 ?It?s just mid-April now. We have made elaborate plans and will start action against doctors violating the order in a few more days,? said a senior health department official. 

 The officials will first visit pharmacies where doctors attend to patients and slap notices on them. 

 If the doctors do not respond, the state Medical Council will be informed. Police help might also be sought.

 The chief medical officer of health and the vigilance cell of Swasthya Bhavan have already been asked to start the drive against doctor practising in pharmacies.

 According to an unofficial estimate, nearly 10,000 doctors attend to patients in pharmacies. Officials believe the figure is much higher.

 Following amendments in the Clinical Establishment Act, the government has made it clear that private practitioners can only practise in chambers. ?Several doctors are at the end of their professional lives. What is the alternative for them?? asked president-elect Roy.

 Whenever I pass by the main gate of Raj Bhavan, I find that the posse of policemen 

posted there do a lot else other than be on guard. On several occasions, I have 

seen some of them dozing, while others were busy chatting on the benches. At times, 

some were busy solving the crossword puzzle in the newspaper. I have even heard 

some of them pass lewd remarks at ladies passing by. The exception is on days 

when a VVIP is scheduled to visit the Raj Bhavan. The building falls in a high 

security zone in the city. Therefore, these guards should not only be alert and 

dutiful but also well-mannered.

 Mother Dairy booths sell paneer manufactured by the dairy and also market 

the Bhagirathi brand cottage cheese. However, while the latter is available at 

the booths on the very next day of manufacture, Mother Dairy?s paneer is 

supplied two days later. The dairy should improve its distribution network and 

ensure that its products reach the market at the earliest.

 Soon Dakshineswar will have to be declared one of the most polluted tourist 

spots in the state. For a long time, an overbridge is being built there. The amount 

of dirt and dust the construction work is producing is taking a toll on people 

living in the area and visitors. The municipal body concerned should take necessary 

action to complete the work as early as possible and curb other sources of pollution.

 A 150-metre stretch of Prince Ghulam Hussain Shah Road, near Bengal Lamp bus 

stop, has 37 potholes of diameter varying from 8 inches to 30 inches. Such is 

the condition of the road that most vehicles now ply along the side of the carriageway 

and not along its middle. These potholes have for company two shallow trenches, 

about 50 metres apart, cutting right across the road. Usually, while one is a 

muddy pool of water, the other serves as a speed-breaker. Moreover, in the absence 

of vats, garbage is strewn all over the place. The road witnesses a heavy traffic 

flow throughout the day as those entering Jadavpur prefer to avoid the pandemonium 

at the 8B bus depot. Can the civic body do something about this ? 

 D. Kar, Address not given. 

 The Corporation has been planning to convert a few electric furnaces to ones 

powered by gas. But why waste the electric furnaces that are worth Rs 80 lakh 

each? Instead of replacing them, the new furnaces can be added.

 Shiv Shankar Almal, Lower Rawdon Street.

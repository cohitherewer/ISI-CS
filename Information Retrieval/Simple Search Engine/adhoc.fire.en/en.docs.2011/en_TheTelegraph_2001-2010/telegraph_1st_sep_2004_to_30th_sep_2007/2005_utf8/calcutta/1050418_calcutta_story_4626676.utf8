 Trees wed to ward off evil

 Two suicides, a murder and an unnatural death in a space of four months ? enough for the residents of Bagha Jatin to suspect that an evil eye is on the neighbourhood.

 And to ward it off, they could think of nothing better than to hold a ?sacred marriage? between a banyan and a peepal. The wedding was held on Saturday and the boubhat is scheduled for Monday.

 The venue was Vidyasagar Block I, where the Kalibari Samity had convened a meeting a few days ago to decide on ways to restore God?s grace on the para. ?Only a marriage between the two old trees can drive off the evil spirit,? pronounced the ?high priest? at the conclave.

 The people of the locality were so rattled by the recent developments that they did not think twice before falling for the suggestion. Such is the sense of fear among a section of them that children and women are not allowed to leave home after sundown.

 Once the gathering approved the idea, elaborate plans were laid for the wedding. More than Rs 50,000 was raised and the wedding reception was attended by around 5,000 people. Machher kalia, khichudi, alur dom, rasogolla and payesh were on the menu.

 However, with the civic election being round the corner, the Opposition CPM cannot but see a ploy in the whole exercise by the Trinamul Congress to appease the voters and cling on to power. ?Everything has been organised by the Trinamul. This is nothing but a political game,? said Khana Ghosh, CPM councillor of ward 103.

 Trinamul councillor (ward 99) Nirmal Kanti Das, the man behind the grand show, is unfazed by the allegations. ?We are getting ready for an even bigger boubhat. The incident has brought together all the residents of the locality, something which politics never can,? argued Das.

 Sushanta Ghosh, one of the organisers, said the people had come forward with whatever they could manage ? from ornaments to cash to even almirahs. ?One must realise the significance of the event.?

 Khana Ghosh, however, is unrelenting. ?The antics will not bring the Trinamul a renewed mandate. The people are sure to vote for change.?

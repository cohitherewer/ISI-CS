 ?I am not a young kid looking for a break?

 Returning to celluloid after 12 years with My Wife rsquo;s Murder, SUCHITRA KRISHNAMURTHY tells Pratim D. Gupta that she is restless but ready to wait for the right roles

 Why did you stop acting in the first place?

 After Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa, I decided not to do any more movies primarily because I wanted to concentrate on my music career. Then I got married, had a kid and never quite thought of getting back to films again all these years in the middle.

 Then what made you change your mind?

 You can say I got a little bored (laughs). I am at such a stage in my career that I need to do things interesting enough to keep me going. So, I just opened myself up to work again. I met a few of my friends in the industry ? people like Kundan Shah and Ram Gopal Varma. I told them that I need to work and that I was getting really restless. So Ramu had this script ready with him and he offered me this interesting part. I was a little surprised, but his confidence in me made me confident and I took it up.

 What was it like returning to the sets after this long?

 Initially I was very nervous. But it wasn?t like I just walked back on to the sets one fine morning. I had lots of rehearsals, workshops and discussions with Ramu and the director Jiji Phillip. We had readings with other actors. So by the time we started shooting, we were well-versed in the script and knew exactly how our emotional graph worked in the film. I went in prepared.

You ended your first innings with a veteran like Kundan Shah and are starting your second with a newcomer like Jiji Phillip?

 Oh, he may be a newcomer but he was always sure of what he was doing and what he wanted. And I have always considered film to be a director?s medium? So I completely entrusted myself to his vision. He was very particular about the tautness of my body language, the exact pitch in which I would throw my voice, the saris I would wear? I used to interact with him a lot. He was very sweet and used to call me ?madam? on the sets. Also, he allowed the unit to be very democratic, with everyone?s suggestions paid attention to.

 But wouldn?t you have been happier returning with a lengthier role rather than play the wife murdered within the first few reels?

 It?s of course not a full-fledged role, but it was a challenge all right. I had to be completely deglamourised to look the character. Sheela is at a stage in her life when she has stopped caring about how she looks. She is quite manic, whereas I am used to being a little vain (laughs). So I would be made to remove by blush. When I would come to the sets with my hair blown dry, Jiji would make me wet my hair and look out of sorts.

 Almost all your scenes are with Anil Kapoor. How was he to work with?

 I have interacted with him socially for quite some time, but this was the first time I actually worked with him. And I was pleasantly surprised with his tenacity and dedication. He is also a very generous co-star, as in he always has the bigger picture in mind. He is experienced enough to know that everyone is important to the film. And he works towards that.

 Will My Wife?s Murder be a one-off assignment or are you here to stay?

 I don?t know. I have my mind and heart open to it. But at the same time I am not jumping around for work? I am not a young kid looking for a break. The best thing in Bollywood these days is that there are more than just teenage love stories that are being made. There are more characters to play. Also, I have a very young child to take care of? I want to be around her. So I can?t just go off on long outdoor schedules. And today in film-making, the stakes are so high that it?s not feasible anymore if it doesn?t work for everyone.

 You are also into painting and have a musical lined up?

 Yes, my art exhibition went off really well, and now we are finally getting together for Candlelight, the musical I was working on. It got delayed a bit, but we hope to start rehearsing by end-August and premiere by February next year.

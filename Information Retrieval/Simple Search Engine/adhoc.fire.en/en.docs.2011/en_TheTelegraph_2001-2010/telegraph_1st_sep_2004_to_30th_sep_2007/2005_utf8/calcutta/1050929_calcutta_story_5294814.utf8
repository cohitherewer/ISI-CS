 Building proposals pending sanction

 - NEW TOWN MONITOR AWAITS DELHI NOD

 The state government?s move to set up a development authority for New Town has run into rough weather, with the Centre sending back the proposal and seeking clarifications for the second time.

 The lack of a development authority has put on hold the framing of building rules and sanctioning of construction plans for the Rajarhat township, prompting the government to amend the Town and Country Planning Act. 

 Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya held a meeting on Wednesday to discuss the amendments, which seek to empower Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco), the implementing agency of New Town, to frame building rules and approve of plans. 

 ?The rules will be finalised within a fortnight. Plot-owners will be able to start construction during the festive season. By the time the buildings will be ready, the township will have a competent authority to provide civic services,? said Hidco general manager Pradyut Biswas.

 The government wants to set up New Town Development Authority (NTDA), on the lines of Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority, for supervising development work in the township and providing civic services to residents till a full-fledged municipal body is established. The Authority is to comprise bureaucrats, engineers and people?s representatives.

 The proposal for the Authority was sent to the Centre for the President?s consent three months ago by Hidco. ?We could have issued an ordinance on our own, but we sought the President?s consent to avoid any legal or administrative problems in future,?? said Biswas.

 But the Centre wrote back to the state government in August, asking for clarifications on the proposed Authority. 

 ?We had replied to all the queries and also outlined the purpose of setting up NTDA. The Centre, however, sought some more clarifications, which we submitted without delay. We hope the President?s consent will arrive soon,? said Biswas.

 Hidco officials blame the absence of a development authority for the problems the authorities are facing on framing building rules and sanctioning construction plans. ?A statutory body, like the Calcutta Municipal Corporation or Bidhannagar Municipality, is a must for New Town,? an official pointed out.

 Hidco has been flooded with complaints from individual and cooperative plot-owners, who have not been able to start construction as their building plans are yet to be sanctioned. Sources said around 2,000 people, who have got residential plots in Action Area I, are waiting for the nod to start construction.

 Joint venture companies, however, are better off as their plans, officials claim, have been sanctioned by Hidco itself. So are plans for schools, markets and information and technology units.

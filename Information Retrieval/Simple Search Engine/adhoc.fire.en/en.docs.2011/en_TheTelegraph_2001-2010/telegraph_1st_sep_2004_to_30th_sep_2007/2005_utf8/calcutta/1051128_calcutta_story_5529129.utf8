The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Assembly poll on camera

 DEBASHISH SEN, chief electoral officer of West Bengal, met readers of The Telegraph on Thursday to answer their queries. Participants included Surajit Neogy, Rajesh Jaiswal, Sourish Misra, Gopal Krishna Chakraborty, Tarun Chowdhury, M.L. Ray, Raja Kar, Diptimoy Ghosh, Sandip Banerjee and Ishan Deb Chatterjee

Sourish Misra: The Election Commission (EC) does not allow people with Electoral Photo Identity Card (EPIC) to vote unless their names are on the voters? list. What then is the use of the EPIC ?

 The EPIC is a proof of identity. According to the law, a person cannot vote unless his or her name appears on the electoral rolls.

 The electoral rolls are continuously revised. The names of those who move out of town, go abroad or pass away are deleted from the list.

Raja Kar: Will we have video cameras inside polling booths during the next Assembly elections?

 Yes, we will instal video cameras in some booths, but we are not announcing where.

M.L. Ray: What should I do if I go to the booth and find that my vote has already been cast?

 If someone else has voted in your name, you can cast a tender vote. Tender votes are cast on ballot paper and are sealed and locked away. They can only be opened on the instructions of the court.

 The presiding officer of the booth is legally bound to let you cast a tender vote. But don?t leave the booth without casting your vote. You can?t return later and cast a tender vote. 

G.K. Chakraborty: Why doesn?t the EC deploy polling teams from other states during elections in Bengal? Can?t we expect neutrality from the EC?

 Polling teams are picked in the most neutral manner. Selection is done randomly, using a software developed by the EC for this exclusive purpose. Observers from outside the state run the software to pick the polling teams.

Diptimoy Ghosh: State government employees are generally reluctant to go on election duty. They say even if rigging occurs, they are powerless to prevent that. What do you have to say regarding this?

 Not all state government employees are unwilling to go on election duty, since they are paid a daily allowance. Let me stress that there is never a security threat on presiding officers. The few stray incidents that have occurred are exceptions. Having said that, some government employees might be put off by the prospect of a long journey.

Diptimoy Ghosh: So you are saying that the presiding officers are not scared of violence?

 The presiding officers have powers equivalent to that of magistrates on poll day. The election handbook says a presiding officer can command the police during election. 

Ishan Deb Chatterjee: Names of voters are being randomly deleted from the electoral rolls. Recently, my grandfather?s name was deleted from the rolls.

 Maybe he wasn?t in the city when the intensive revision of rolls was conducted. We even did door-to-door surveys.

 We have been asking people to go to polling booths and check whether their name is on the electoral rolls. If you cannot find your name, get a Form 6 and fill it up. Once you submit the form, your name will be included in the rolls. 

 Revision of rolls will be carried out after December 3, which is the last date for submitting applications. 

Ishan Deb Chatterjee: Was my grandfather?s name deleted because he is 82 years old? 

 We haven?t instructed election officials to delete names of people over 80. However, the EC does prescribe that the whereabouts of people above 80 be checked. Inquiries should be made about whether they are alive or not. If someone has passed away, the name is deleted from the list.

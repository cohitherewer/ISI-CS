 Probe into route violation 

 - Not more than five to a taxi, top cop warns drivers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Commissioner of Calcutta Police Prasun Mukherjee on Thursday ordered a probe into Wednesday?s accident, in which a truck entered Taratala Road, closed to such heavy vehicles, and collided with a taxi carrying 10 passengers, killing eight of them.

 ?I have asked deputy commissioner (traffic) Arun Sharma to conduct the probe and find out how the truck entered that road. We could not deploy enough traffic policemen at major intersections because a large number of policemen were posted on the routes of the Prime Minister?s convoy,? said Mukherjee, at the opening ceremony of Calcutta Police Sports Meet at Alipore Bodyguard Lines on Thursday.

 He said taxi driver Rajeshwar Sharma, who was killed in the accident, had violated rules by carrying 10 passengers. ?Officers of the traffic department have been asked to strictly enforce the existing restriction ? not more than five passengers in a taxi,? Mukherjee stressed.

 Preliminary investigations conducted by the fatal squad of the traffic department revealed a major lapse on the part of policemen deployed at the Taratala crossing. 

 ?According to existing norms, trucks are not allowed to cross the Taratala intersection from 8 am to 9 pm. Yesterday, there was a special instruction for police not to allow a single truck at the crossing. The Prime Minister was scheduled to attend a programme at National Library, only three km from the spot of the accident,? said an official of the traffic department.

 Immediately after the accident, Mukherjee held a meeting with joint commissioner (traffic) Banibrata Basu and Sharma. ?We have decided to extend the divider on Taratala Road. Apart from this, the number of traffic policemen will be increased in front of popular spots like the Alipore zoo and Victoria Memorial, where taxis carry passengers violating the norm,? said Basu.

 Basu warned taxi drivers: ?From now on, taxis will not be allowed to carry more than five passengers. If anyone is found violating this rule, stern action will be taken.?

 Elsewhere in the city on Thursday, two persons were killed and half-a-dozen injured in separate accidents.

 A motorcyclist, identified as Nilkrishna Pal (28), died when a container-truck knocked him down on Paharpur Road, in the port area, around 8.30 am. The driver fled and police impounded the vehicle.

 In the Regent Park area, Biswajit Ghosh, 42, was run over and killed by an unknown vehicle on NSC Bose Road in the morning. 

 Three persons were injured when an SBSTC bus collided with a taxi on Rajendra Lal Mukherjee Road, in Beleghata. The injured were admitted to NRS Hospital where their condition was said to be stable. 

 Narayan Chakraborty, a rickshaw-puller, was injured when a Maruti van hit him on Raja Manindra Road. The driver managed to flee with his vehicle. 

 Another cycle rickshaw-puller, Ram Charan Kayal, was hit by a private bus on Dum Dum Road. He was admitted to RG Kar Hospital.

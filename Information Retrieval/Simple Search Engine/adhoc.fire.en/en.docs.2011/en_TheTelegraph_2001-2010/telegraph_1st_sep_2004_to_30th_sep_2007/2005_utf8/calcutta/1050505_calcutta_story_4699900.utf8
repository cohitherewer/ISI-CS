Kaals about preserving nature

Screen On amp; Off

From Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and Pinjar to Waqt and Kaal, 

cinematographer SANTOSH THUNDIYIL has captured some of the best frames in the 

business. He speaks to Pratim D. Gupta about the clean richness of Waqt, 

the clean chit to Kaal and why Rakesh Roshans next film Krrish is a must-watch

 Amitabh Bachchan in Waqt

 When it comes to cinematography, FTII alumni still 

rules?

Yes, I graduated from the Pune school in 1993 and 

then started working in both Mumbai and Kerala. My first film was in Mumbai with 

one of my director-batchmates of FTII, Sirendra Singh, starring Kareena Kapoor 

and Sanjay Kapoor, which got shelved midway. I had shot a song composed by A. 

R. Rahman and written by Gulzar. After that I went back south and did a Malayalam 

film.

 Where did Karan Johar discover you?

Karan was looking for fresh people who had time and 

were also able. When Renu Saluja was editing my rushes (for the unfinished film) 

Karan had come inside the room and seen my work. He offered the film and there 

I was shooting for Kuch Kuch Hota Hai within two years of my passing out 

of film school. 

 Did you face any difficulty?

It was very tough. I was not exposed to the Hindi 

film shooting structure. We shot the college song (Yeh ladki?) in our first 

schedule and I was really anxious, but let my instincts take over. The toughest 

schedule for Kuch Kuch Hota Hai was, however, the one in Ooty where we 

shot for around one month with 100 kids. Kids and animals are always the most 

tough to shoot. And to be on an outdoor schedule with them in the middle of mist 

and rain was really challenging.

 Why did you go back to Kerala despite the massive 

success of Kuch Kuch??

I left Mumbai because I wasn?t excited about working 

there. Also I wanted to come back and do some good work in my home state. But 

once back, I realised that things weren?t good there too. I had to go back to 

Mumbai and I did films like Tera Jadoo Chal Gaya and Hello Brother.

 You again shot to fame with your work in Pinjar?

I was always fascinated by period films. One of the 

very reasons I came to cinematography was because of my love for period films 

since my school and college days. Period films have this photographic brilliance 

that other films cannot have. So when I learnt that I could visually translate 

Amrita Pritam?s novel, I was very excited.

Rok Sako To Rok Lo must have been a bizarre 

experience?

(Laughs) Art director Sameer Chanda put me 

on to Arindam Chaudhuri. He wanted to experiment with the medium of film-making 

and my job was to guide and help his efforts as much as I could. I couldn?t possibly 

experiment myself when so much experimentation was being done around me by a new 

set of people.

 Did you watch the original Gujarati play before 

starting your work on Waqt?

No, I didn?t. Waqt was largely a simple movie 

with no complication. Director Vipul Shah wanted a clean and rich look for the 

film. It was my first working opportunity with Amitabh Bachchan. So on the first 

day of shooting I told him: ?I?m nervous.? He replied: ?I?m nervous too.? Such 

is the greatness of the man that he still treats every film as a fresher. Akshay 

and Priyanka, too, were fantastic on the sets with no tension around.

 How was it returning to the Karan Johar camp with 

Kaal?

It was fantastic. We finished the film before time. 

I wasn?t disappointed that he didn?t ask me to do Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham 

and Kal Ho Naa Ho because I wasn?t available then. Kaal, of 

course, is unlike anything Karan has done before.

 Did you actually shoot in the non-permitted areas 

of the Corbett National Park?

That?s all nonsense. Knowing Dharma Productions and 

also director Soham for some time now, they do everything very systematically. 

All the permissions were processed one year prior to the shooting schedules. All 

the planning was done very meticulously with the script given to the cast and 

crew seven months before the start. Even BBC shoots where we shot. It?s not that 

you can?t shoot there but you can?t get down at all places and can?t use the lights 

and reflectors everywhere. We were in our cars and had our camera on. There was 

a forest official always with us and he was even recording what we were shooting. 

If you look at the film, Kaal is all about preserving nature and not destroying 

it.

 You are also doing Rakesh Roshan?s next film Krrish 

with Hrithik and Priyanka?

It will be a benchmark of sorts with Tony Ching directing 

the action sequences. He had earlier called the shots for films like The Hero 

and The House of Flying Daggers. The post-production will be done in Los 

Angeles. We have shot in Kulu Manali after a 90-day shooting schedule in Singapore. 

There?s still 150 days of shooting left and the film will only get ready by December.

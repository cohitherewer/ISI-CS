The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Queen Elizabeth II 

You are not one to look back; you push forward, making new friends and showing the world how dependable and cooperative you are. You are friendly and easy to get along with, even for your rivals. You rarely feel threatened by challenges because you are sure of yourself. You don?t take on projects unless you are certain of success. ? Kusum Bhandari

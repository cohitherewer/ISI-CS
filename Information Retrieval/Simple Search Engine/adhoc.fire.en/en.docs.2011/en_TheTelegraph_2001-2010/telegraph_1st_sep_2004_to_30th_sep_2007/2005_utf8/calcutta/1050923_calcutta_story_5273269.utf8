The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Frowns greet new fares

 - Transport operators pitch for relief in cess, sales tax

 OUR BUREAU

 Come Mahalaya and commuting by public transport would be dearer, with the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government announcing a hike in the fare structures on Thursday.

 Bus and minibus fares will increase by 50 paise at each stage. The minimum taxi fare will be Rs 20, up from Rs 17. Every subsequent 200 metres will add Rs 1.80, an upward revision of 10 paise. Calcutta Tramways Company and Calcutta State Transport Corporation buses, trams and water transport will also charge 50 paise more at every stage.

 State transport minister Subhas Chakraborty announced the new fare structures at Writers? Buildings following a nod from the Left Front, which cleared the proposal in a meeting at Alimuddin Street on Thursday morning.

 ?The increase in fuel prices has compelled us to revise the fares. We have discussed the matter with transport operators,? the minister said after the announcement. 

 The last hike in public transport fares was on January 24 this year.

 Chakraborty also said he had told the transport operators to pay salaries to bus drivers and conductors, replacing the commission system.

 ?In many cases we find that the unions are running the show, instead of the bus-owners. We have told the owners they have to rein in the drivers and conductors. Only then can they be made more accountable for maintenance of the vehicles, accidents and other matters,? the minister said.

 One of the main grievances of the operators was that the traffic police were slapping exorbitant spot fines on them. ?Come what may, I have asked them (the operators) not to pay spot fines. Let them get the cases registered and contest them, because every bus is forced to shell out an average of Rs 5,000 a month as spot fines alone,? minister Chakraborty pointed out.

 Many unhappy transport operators, however, have threatened to agitate against the fare hike and to push their demands after Puja 2005.

 Bengal Bus Syndicate president Swarnakamal Saha said: ?We want relief in cess and sales tax, not increased fares. Also, commission for drivers and conductors must be calculated after deduction of fuel costs. Though we are accepting the new fare structure now, we will meet the minister on October 14, placing our demands afresh.?

 Bimal Guha, general secretary of the Bengal Taxi Association, said: ?We fear that there will be fewer takers for taxis due to the fare hike. We will announce in a week whether or not we intend to start an agitation after Pujas.?

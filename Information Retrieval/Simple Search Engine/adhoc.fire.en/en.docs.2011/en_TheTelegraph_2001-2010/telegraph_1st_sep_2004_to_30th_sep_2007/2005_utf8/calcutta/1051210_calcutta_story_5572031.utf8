The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Rush for study in spirituality

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 When life hits the fast lane, the need to take a breather grows by the hour. This fact is now backed by figures, given the number of applications piling up for the meditation course that the Ramakrishna Mission has introduced.

 The authorities at the Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Educational and Research Institute (deemed university) had thought that 50 seats would be enough for the two-year diploma course on meditation and spiritual life, launched at Belur Math on Friday.

 But as applications started pouring in, the seats had to be increased to 116 in a month. After 200 application forms were distributed, the university decided not to issue any more.

 ?When we took the decision to introduce the course, probably the first of its kind in the state, we felt 50 seats would be enough. Our expectation was that only retired and elderly persons would be interested,? said vice-chancellor Swami Atmapriyananda.

 The monks were pleasantly surprised on finding that the applicants were from almost every walk of life and age group ? engineers, doctors, lawyers, management executives, businessmen, teachers and students. Only 14 of the 116 candidates are 60-plus.

 ?We are passing through a phase in which people, irrespective of their position in society, feel that they must have a strong mind to stand on their feet. This, I think, is one reason why so many applicants from such diverse backgrounds are willing to join the course,? the vice-chancellor explained.

 ?The teachers, around one-fourth of the admission-seekers, said at the interview that they wanted to be acquainted with their higher selves to impart better training to their students,? a monk told Metro.

 Each applicant had to face an interview, during which the monks examined whether he/she was serious about delving into spirituality.

 This was necessary as the students have to go through a regular academic procedure, attending class and appearing for unit and semester exams. There will be no practical session on meditation.

 The monks? expectations were, however, belied on one count. They had hoped for a good response from housewives, but only six of them sought admission.

 The course has no age bar for candidates, though they need to have passed the Higher Secondary examinations.

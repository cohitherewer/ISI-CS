 Venue hunt for hangman film

 Two days after the Nandan authorities abruptly ? and arbitrarily ? stopped the screening of One Day from a Hangman?s Life, director Joshy Joseph is still looking for a suitable venue for his documentary film.

 Passed by the censor board without a single cut, the film ran for six shows till Monday evening when chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee allegedly asked the Nandan authorities to drop it. The film?s posters were also pulled down immediately.

 The official line at Nandan was non-feasibility. ?The film was drawing an audience of 10-12 people per show, a maximum of 20, at Nandan II,? stated director Nilanjan Chattopadhyay.

 So do many other films at the state-run auditorium. What prompted the pullout, claims the film-maker, was the chief minister taking an exception to the film?s posters and the portrayal of the hangman.

 Joseph insists that his film doesn?t glorify Nata Mullick. ?It?s a character and social study, not a biopic,? he clarifies. ?I have demystified the hangman from a highly fictionalised story surrounding him. Nata Mullick was providing the media with extremely morbid and macabre stories surrounding Hetal Parekh?s family which were mostly invented.?

 The documentary is based on June 24, 2004, the day when Dhananjoy Chattopadhyay?s death sentence was deferred to a later date, says the self-taught Malayalee film-maker who shifted to Calcutta some six summers ago to make films on the Northeast. Joseph is now a director with Films Division. Two of his documentaries on Manipur have fetched national awards.

 ?It?s a film against capital punishment but it is also a personal psychological study of a strange character. I tried to show how a hangman became a celebrity and the spokesperson for the system. I have tried not to be cruel to him and also showed his sense of insecurity,? adds Joseph, who had assisted Adoor Gopalakrishnan in the making of Shadow Kill, the feature film on a hangman.

 So more than looking at Mullick the person, Joseph has shaped his film as a critique of the media for ?the hype it created?, the government for its ?unholy stand? and the hangman for his ?intention of squeezing money out of every comment he made to the media?.

 The bulk of the footage for the film was canned at Mullick?s south Calcutta home and the gallows of Alipore Central jail. Dhananjoy?s presence is limited to bits and pieces from newspaper clips.

 Joseph had started the film on his own but later Drik India helped him out with the finances. One Day from a Hangman?s Life will also be screened at the British Council Digital Film Festival later this year. For now, the 83-minute documentary has been selected as an entry for the national awards.

 Don hired to extract dues

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Extortionist Gopal Tiwari, arrested in Hyderabad on May 22, has revealed during police interrogation that at least on nine occasions over the past year-and-a-half, businessmen from Burrabazar and Posta had engaged him to mop up their dues ? running into lakhs ? against hefty payments.

 Generally, Tiwari would entrust his hand-picked men to carry out the orders that he would give through his cell phones from Hyderabad.

 The chilling confessions forced the city police detective department to double-check the facts with some of Tiwari?s associates. 

 Accordingly, Manoj Sharma, alias Manojia, one of Tiwari?s men in Burrabazar, was detained on Thursday. During intense grilling, Manojia confirmed on Saturday night that Tiwari had worked for several traders and even named a few.

 Cops have now launched a hunt for the traders but are tight-lipped about further details. ?We are interrogating him. Our probe is on and we will not comment on it,? said Damayanti Sen, deputy commissioner of police, detective department (special).

 Police have also learnt that for his ?client-servicing?, Tiwari would seek the help of associates of his ?friends? like Sheikh Vinod and Rashid Alam, alias Gabbar ? two of the city?s most dreaded extortionists who were arrested only recently. 

 By his own admission, among those who visited his plush house in Hyderabad were Hatkata Dilip and Sheikh Vinod.

 ?In 2003, Tiwari had struck a deal of a few lakhs with one of his clients sitting at a popular restaurant in Maniktala. He later pumped the money into a betting racket,? said an investigating officer.

 Tiwari has reportedly admitted trying to set up base in Mumbai, before moving to Jaipur and then to Hyderabad.

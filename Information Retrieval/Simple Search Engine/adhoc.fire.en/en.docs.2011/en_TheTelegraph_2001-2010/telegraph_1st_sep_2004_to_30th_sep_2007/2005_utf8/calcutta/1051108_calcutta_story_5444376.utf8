 Rickshaw licence breather 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The state government might have decided to do away with hand-pulled rickshaws by November 15, but the city civic body is still not averse to renewing their licences.

 On August 15, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had announced that the hand-pulled rickshaws must go as ?the sight of a human being pulling another for a pittance does not enhance Calcutta?s image?. The rickshaws would stop plying in three to four months, he had asserted.

 Civic commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay, however, said on Monday: ?The mayor has directed me to accept prayers for the renewal of licences of hand-pulled rickshaws, but not to issue new licences.?

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) Act of 1980 grants the municipal commissioner the power to grant licences to hand-pulled rickshaws.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya had said earlier: ?It is an inhuman scene from the Middle Ages ? a man riding on another man?s shoulders. It is an eyesore for Calcutta, as well as the nation. We must get rid of this ugly system.? 

 According to official estimates, there are 20,000 hand-drawn rickshaws and carts in the city. The actual number is double that and more.

 A CMC licence officer claimed that 70 per cent of the hand-pulled rickshaws are owned by constables and havildars of Calcutta Police.

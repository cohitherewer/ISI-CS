 All you ever wanted to know about real estate in and around town is now just a mouse-click away. 

 The Confederation of Real Estate Developers? Association of India (CREDAI)-Bengal announced the launch of its official website on Thursday.

 Unveiling the website ? www.credaibengal.com ? state urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said: ?This is a commendable effort and will help us market the city better. It will also help people from remote areas to track property stock in Calcutta.?

 The website is aimed at creating a ready reckoner for all queries related to real estate and other related topics and in a ?first-time attempt?, carries a vector image of the city, courtesy CMDA.

 ?It offers detailed information on all real estate matters and allied sectors. The site is an eye-opener for the lay man, who is often intimidated by the complicated legal and financial matters of buying a home, and offers detailed solutions,? said CREDAI-Bengal president Jugal Khetawat.

 Forum secretary Pradip Chopra observed: ?The website has some unique features and our apex body, as well as its other members, are planning to replicate our model.?

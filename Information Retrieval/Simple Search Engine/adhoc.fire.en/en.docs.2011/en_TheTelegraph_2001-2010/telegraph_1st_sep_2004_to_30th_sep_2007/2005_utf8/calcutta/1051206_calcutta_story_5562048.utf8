 Prison path paved for rogue drivers 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Drivers breaking road rules will no longer be able to get away with a fine or a punched licence. The traffic department is trying to ensure that guilty drivers spend some time behind bars and are not let off without a long legal battle.

 The existing policy is to book errant bus and minibus drivers under the Motor Vehicles Act. The offenders will now be arrested and tried in court. 

 In a meeting last week at the Lalbazar police headquarters, it was decided that cases of ?rash and negligent driving? would henceforth be recorded under section 279 of the Indian Penal Code, instead of section 184 of the Motor Vehicles Act.

 While the law was always there, it was never exercised to protect police stations from taking on the extra load of traffic cases.

 ?In any incident of rash and negligent driving, the traffic department will now lodge a complaint against the driver with the local police station. The concerned thana will file a case against the accused, under section 279 of the IPC,? stated a senior officer of the traffic department.

 Under section 184 of the Motor Vehicles Act, a person guilty of driving rashly or speeding dangerously is fined between Rs 400 and Rs 1,200, depending on his offence record. The licence can also be punched, but on no account is the driver put behind bars.

 Under section 279, a driver can be arrested for the same fault and the case pursued in a court of law. Even though the offence is bailable, the offender might have to spend a few hours behind bars, until the court opens and he or she finds a guarantor.

 According to the cops, after a case is initiated, the accused would have to turn up in court during trial and might be sentenced to six months? imprisonment. 

 ?The fact that the offender will have to spend a few hours in the lockup and face the trouble of turning up at court during trial should act as deterrent. Besides, slapping a chargesheet in such a case is not difficult,? opined a senior police officer.

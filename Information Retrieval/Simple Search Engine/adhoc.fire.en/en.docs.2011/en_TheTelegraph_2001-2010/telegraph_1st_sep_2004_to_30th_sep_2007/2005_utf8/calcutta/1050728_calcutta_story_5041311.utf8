 Housing eyes PSU-locked land

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The housing needs of the city can only be met by making use of the land now under the control of the defence ministry, railways, Port Trust and public sector undertakings (PSUs), feels the state government.

 ?We have been asking the Centre for some time to unlock the surplus land under the control of the various departments and PSUs, and ensure that the pattern of their use changes,? state housing minister Goutam Deb stated in the Assembly on Wednesday.

 ?Only some bold policy decisions can help provide homes for people living in Calcutta and its suburbs in the coming years. Otherwise, it will be a tough job to set up 90,000 residential units every year for the next two decades,? the minister added.

 As per estimates, 22 million people will live in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area in 2025. They will require about 5.46 million houses. The present pace of construction needs to be increased to meet the target.

 According to Deb, the national housing policy acknowledges some of the requirements, but the Centre is yet to take concrete measures on them. The state government, too, will be required to unlock the lands controlled by several of its PSUs, the minister said.

 ?The other requirement is to have a much better flow of funds at cheaper rates, along with a long gestation period. Only if loans, which can be repaid over a long period of time, are offered at reasonable interest rates, can the lower income group afford houses.?

 Deb said that around 75 per cent of the population in the state belonged to the middle or lower-income group or come from the economically-weaker sections. 

 ?Even if the steps to boost housing do not appear beneficial, they will ultimately yield good results. Growth in real estate will have a multiplier effect since the industry is so labour-intensive. The entire economy will ultimately benefit,? Deb explained.

 The minister cautioned that with families becoming smaller, the need for houses would increase further. The average number of persons per dwelling unit is expected to decrease from 5.1 now to about 4.6 per unit in 2025.

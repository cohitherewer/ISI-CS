The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Eyeline giants in skyline sully 

Billboard bane of Maidan

 - Civic body, Metro Rail allow massive billboards to dominate Maidan vista

 A STAFF REPORTER

 For Rs 30 per sq ft a year, the civic authorities are allowing indiscriminate encroachment of the Calcutta skyline. And the Metro Railway is their partner in aesthetic crime. 

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya and municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay feel the time has come to rein in the outdoor advertising agencies. 

 ?An important point to ponder is that the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) earns only between Rs 12 crore and Rs 13 crore annually by allowing billboards to be put up,? stated Bhattacharya.

 ?There are so many avenues to popularise a product. Why is there a scramble among advertising agencies to put up billboards?? he wondered.

 There are about 8,000 billboards in the city, offering a minimum advertisement space of 4.8 million sq ft. 

 Mayoral council member in charge of information and cultural affairs Faiyaz Ahmed Khan said his department would soon set limits to the number of billboards that can be put up in different parts of the city. Areas with rich heritage will be declared billboard-free zones, he added.

 Chief municipal architect and town planner Anindya Karforma has been asked to identify the zones where billboards will not be allowed.

 The Metro Railway, though, is blas? about the billboards that it has allowed to dominate the Maidan vista.

 When contacted, deputy chief operating manager of Metro Railway A.K. Samanta said: ?Talk to our public relations officer.? 

 Senior Metro Railway public relations officer Surya Kumar Basu maintained: ?Billboards messing up the city skyline is not that great an issue. I have so much other work to do. It is not possible for me to say how many billboards have been put up on Metro stations in the Maidan area or whether we have received any instruction from the state government to pull them down.? 

 Custodians of the Maidan, the army, is, however, concerned about the scores of billboards atop the Metro stations in the area. At a civil-military liaison conference attended by the principal secretaries of the state government, the director-general of police and commissioners of the CMC and Calcutta Police, GOC Bengal area Major-General Z.U. Shah asserted: ?The Maidan area has been sullied by the hoardings.?

 He said the billboards had been allowed as the Metro Railway had pleaded that it was facing a financial crunch. ?What stops the Metro Railway from tearing down the hoardings, now that it is not doing as badly as earlier?? continued the GOC.

 Another senior army officer asked: ?The entire stretch of the Maidan, from Victoria Memorial to Esplanade, is being beautified by various state departments and private organisations. Why should billboards mar the view??

 State home secretary Prasad Ranjan Roy said: ?We?ve written to the Metro Railway authorities several times regarding this, but did not receive a response?, prompting GOC Shah to suggested an ultimatum.

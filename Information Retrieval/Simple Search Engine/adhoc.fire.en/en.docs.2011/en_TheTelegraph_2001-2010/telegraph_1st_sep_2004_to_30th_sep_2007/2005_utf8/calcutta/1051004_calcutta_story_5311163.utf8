 - GERMAN ENVOY TAKES INITIATIVE

 ?I remember where I was and what I did when Kennedy was assassinated, when man landed on the moon, when the Berlin Wall fell and when the twin towers of the World Trade Centre were struck down.?

 Now, as G?nter Wehrmann, new consul-general of Germany in Calcutta, settles down in his office (marking the 15th anniversary of German Unity Day at a star address on Monday evening), he is keen to strengthen ties with ?an exciting city on its way up?.

 An accomplished photographer who has travelled extensively around the globe to capture striking images that articulate the character and nuances of a place, he is eager to spread the good word about Calcutta. Besides freeze-framing the ?fascinating contrasts?, Wehrmann, who comes off a stint in Boston, Massachusetts, has already kicked off an initiative to portray the positives back home.

 Having put ?everything down on a fact-sheet? and mailed a diplomatic cable for the benefit of the business brass in Germany, Wehrmann?s next mission is trying to get German business correspondents to write about Calcutta. ?It?s important to understand that there is no Mr Birla or Mr Tata in Germany. The business community simply studies trends in various zones across the world. These people would like to know, for instance, what the market for ball bearings in Calcutta is like, or how much an acre of land costs in New Town. That?s why it?s crucial to have the city featured in the economic press.?

 Wehrmann is buoyant on the birdie-biz mix as well. ?The Consular Corps golf meet-cum-business seminar presents a wonderful opportunity to project the state as a viable business site. Instead of confining the delegates to five-star hotels, which are really only gilded cages, it?s pertinent to show them around. For instance, the swank Sector V and a magic mall like City Centre, which saves you the airfare to Europe or America.?

 From the city?s subway trains (?as good as any Tube system anywhere in the world?) to the freshly-launched Subway sandwiches outlet, Wehrmann finds pluses in every step he takes in new Calcutta. ?The fact that Subway ran out of bread is a hugely significant pointer to the fact that the city is ready. And it?s an opportunity for Germany as well, since we make some of the world?s finest breads,? he says with a smile.

 And in all this progress, the consul-general, who had been posted in (then) Madras in the early 80s, is eager to trace a common thread with his homeland. When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 and then on October 3, 1990, Germany was reunited after more than 40 years, Wehrmann was stationed in New York.

 ?The night the Wall came down, our New York office organised a reception and I had just read Freedom at Midnight. We decided to call it Liberty at Midnight! Now, as we celebrate 15 years of the momentous occasion, we are aware that Calcutta has followed the sequence of events closely and identified with the fall of the Wall passionately. The relevance of October 3 goes much beyond Germany,? feels Wehrmann.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A city he?ll despise

 A day after Aftab Ansari was shifted to Alipore Central jail, the prison authorities were on a security high drive, shifting Rashid Alam, alias Gabbar, from Alipore Central to Presidency jail on Friday. 

 Gabbar, one of the most dreaded extortionists now behind bars, was shifted around 11.30 am in a prison van, heavily guarded by armed police. Prison officials claimed the shift was aimed at cutting down chances of two ?high-risk prisoners? meeting up in the same jail and working out an escape plan.

 ?Jahan bhi ho, Kalkatta kabhi nahin.? An hour and a half after his release from Presidency jail on Friday, Shakil Mullick just can?t get over Calcutta. 

 After having suffered three years in a dingy cell, only to be told that he was in no way linked to the American Center attack, Shakil did not hide his contempt for the city and its police. So, even if he thinks he has no place in the world outside, he vouched never to return to the city. 

 ?Five days after I was picked up by Jaipur police on February 9, 2002, and taken to Jalupura police station, some officers from Calcutta arrived and told me they wanted to know a few things about my uncle Jamiluddin Nasir. I was brought to Calcutta by the Jodhpur-Howrah Express and taken to a place called Laal? The next day, I was produced in court,? Shakil recounted. 

 ?For the next 14 days, the officers would take me out of the lockup to a room, make me sit through the day and then send me back. No questions, nothing. On the 15th day, I was packed off to Presidency jail. That was February 28, 2002,? he continued. 

 Accompanied by his lawyer, Shakil was answering queries in a Ripon Street house.

 ?Jo badnami ho gaya, yeh abhi mitney wala nahin. Hum to Aftab Ansari ko pehechantey bhi nahin (It will take time for the blot on me to go. I didn?t even know Aftab Ansari),? Shakil asserted. 

 ?I first saw him at Bankshal court. I have not been to school and was not even aware what papers were required to buy a car. But I was charged with helping Aftab?s team buy a jeep,? he added. 

 In a white round-neck T-shirt and faded green trousers, the father of a six-year-old daughter expressed the fear that he would not be able to earn a living. ?I had learnt embroidery in Delhi and then joined Mumtaz Embroidery in Jaipur. This is the only job I know, but who will now employ me? I will return to abbu and amma and think of my next step.? 

 His voice wavering, Shakil said: ?Mera koi kasur nahin saab (I am innocent, sir).?

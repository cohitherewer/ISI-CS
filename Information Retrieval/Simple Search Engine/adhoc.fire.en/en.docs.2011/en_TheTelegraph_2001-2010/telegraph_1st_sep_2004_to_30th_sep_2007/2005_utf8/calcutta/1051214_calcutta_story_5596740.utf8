The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Scholar at Writers?

 A STAFF REPORTER

 It was a dream come true for the man from Milan.

 The scholar who interpreted myths to a packed GD Birla Sabhagar on Monday evening was taken on a guided tour of Writers? Buildings the morning after.

 ?I have been fascinated by the historical significance of this building. I have wanted to come here for quite some time,? said Roberto Calasso after the tour.

 He arrived at Writers? around 11.30 am, accompanied by Italian consul-general Augustino Pinna. Calasso later said that he was immediately struck by the character of the building. 

 The writer and his entourage walked through several passages and corridors, including the seats of power on the first and second floors.

 Calasso would have liked a more thorough tour. He was told that he would require permission in advance for that.

 Asked if Calcutta would figure in his future works, the scholar said it was inevitable since the city had touched him deeply. He expressed his desire to come back. The author of Ka and K left the building after a courtesy call on the chief secretary and home secretary.

Life

 Its back to basics, 25 years on

 UB40 bassist EARL FALCONER speaks to Pratim D. Gupta about how the band stuck together through the decades, the new album and Indian influences on their ever-changing tune

 UB40 at a recent performance and (below) the cover of Who You Fighting For, the bands new album released to mark 25 years of making music together 

 In 1978, a gang of eight childhood friends formed a band in the Moseley area of England. From performing cover versions of their favourite reggae stars, the electric eight went on to become one of the most popular bands across the world ? UB40. 

 Now at 25, having stuck together through the years, the group is still trying to create new music. They have no choice ? they get bored with anything old. In this exclusive telephonic chat, Goodlife got to know more about the boys from Birmingham.

 UB40 has released 23 albums in 25 years. How have you been able to balance quality with quantity?

 Thats what we do really. When we are ready with an LP, we want to share it with the world. Then once the album is out we get bored and start creating new music all over again. Some songs turn out to be good, some turn out to be great and some are not so good (laughs). 

 Sometimes we look back in hindsight and realise that a particular song could have been better. But then again once we finish an album, we are always looking to start something new.

 How do you think the words and music have changed over this quarter of a century?

 Its largely remained the same. We still try to say the same kind of things. But times, of course, have changed. The Berlin Wall has come down. Communism has died. Mandela has been freed. So there have been lots of changes and we have made the necessary changes in our music.

 Is it as exciting to create music after all these years?

 Oh yes. For our new album, we went back to our basics. Usually, we work on the computer first and then get our songs together. But this time we got together in Birmingham to rehearse in a cellar and got as many as 40 songs. Then we started cutting down so that we could include the best tracks for the new compilation. 

 Your new album Who You Fighting For has a track named Reasons by the Dhol Busters. Why did you go for such a distinct Asian flavour for such an important album?

 We have dabbled in Asian music before. One of our popular songs Dont break my heart was done by a Pakistani guy. We got to hear the track Reasons through a common friend named Mambo who manages Apache. He was the same man who was instrumental in getting us to India for a Bollywood awards night. When we heard the number, we liked it and tried our demo version. It turned out really well and we decided to include it in the final line-up as well.

 So are you keen followers of Bollywood music too?

 We have all listened to a lot of Bollywood music. Our lead singer (Ali Campbell) is a big fan of Bollywood music. He even has Indian drums at home. He is a very good percussionist and wanted to play the drums. But that wasnt possible because he was also the best singer amongst the eight of us. So he couldnt end up a drummer. We are also in touch with a lot of Bhangra music. We have loads of friends in Bhangra bands. We just love good music in any form.

 Your covers like I cant help falling in love and Red, red wine have been bigger hits than some of your originals. How different is it to render a remake number from an original track?

 We just did reggae versions of the songs. Both the songs happened by chance. We were asked to do I cant help falling in love for a particular movie but our version was rejected. But the song had been made and we kept it in the album. It was a big accident and it turned out to be a sweet one.

 You have sung for the United Nation AIDS Awareness Campaign and also the English rugby teams official song. How important is it for UB40 to be associated with such assignments?

 In both the instances, we were invited to do the songs. Thank God, the English team won the World Cup (laughs). We are no rugby fans. But it was another fantastic freak incident.

 You have collaborated so often with big names. Dont you feel the spotlight shifts?

 We do it for the song. If the song needs it, so be it. Like we did it with Chrissie Hynde (for the Free Nelson Mandela concert).

 How come all eight of you have stayed together for 25 years when bands split up every second day?

 UB40 is a band of friends first and then a music band. We have been in school together. We were always real friends, much before the band was created. And its a democratic band. We all get paid the same amount of money. So there is no chance of an argument. We also know where we are coming from. We came from nothing.

 When free tickets to the LIVE 8 charity concert started appearing on eBay for a hefty price, those committed to the cause of alleviating hunger and poverty in Africa made themselves heard.

 A record-breaking two million SMSs were received for a lottery for free tickets to the London concert. Every message sent raised pound;1.5.

 But when the tickets started appearing on the Internet auction site, success quickly turned sour.

 Bob Geldof, the Irish rocker behind the Hyde Park extravaganza featuring Pink Floyd, U2, Sting (picture right) Paul McCartney, Coldplay, Madonna, Robbie Williams and REM amongst others, called eBay an ldquo;electronic pimp rdquo;, before asking fans to bombard the site with inflated bids to sabotage any attempts at resale. 

 When bids running into millions of pounds were registered, the authorities finally got the message and decided to step in to prevent scalpers from attempting resale.

 This was after it earlier refused to take action, as their is nothing illegal about the act.

 ldquo;We have listened to eBay rsquo;s community of users and the message has been clear mdash; that they do not want the tickets to be sold on the site. Once we are made aware of any Live 8 tickets being resold they will be taken down, rdquo; an eBay spokesperson told Reuters.

 Geldof, who organised the hugely successful Live Aid fundraiser 20 years ago for famine-stricken Ethiopia, condemned the people selling the tickets as well as the site for allowing it.

 ldquo;The people who are selling it are wretches. But far worse is the corporate culture which capitalises on people rsquo;s misery, rdquo; he had said.

 Amen to that.

 At age 24, tabla player Abhishek Basu rsquo;s motto is to reach Indian classical music to his generation through Ism. The band, formed in 2003, has already held concerts at several venues across the city.

 ldquo;Young Indians are interested in western music. I want to revive classical Indian music through Ism and reach out to them, rdquo; says Abhishek, who creates compositions for the band. ldquo;I started training under percussionist Bikram Ghosh at age six. Later I also trained under his father Shankar Ghosh, rdquo; he adds.

 Ism (short for Impromptu Symphonic Mind) comprises Ratul Shankar Ghosh on drums, Indradeep Ghosh on violin, Sourav Roy on keyboards, and vocalists Shounak Chatterjee and Amrita Ghosh. Outside Ism, Abhishek has played alongside sarod exponent Tarun Bhattacharya in a couple of concerts in the US. Ism has a concert slated for July 23 at Netaji Indoor Stadium.

 Cash sops for green switch

 SIMI KAMBOJ

 The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government is contemplating an offer of financial sops to coax taxis and autorickshaws to switch to green fuel.

 In a proposal tabled with the finance department last week, the transport department has suggested a waiver of a year?s road tax for autos and taxis if they convert to LPG. 

 The department is also willing to forgo a conversion fee of Rs 100 for each vehicle switching over.

 Currently, autorickshaws are required to pay an annual road tax of Rs 600, while for taxis, the amount ranges between Rs 1,400 and Rs 1,600, depending on the seating capacity of the vehicle. 

 The road tax waiver would mean a revenue loss of Rs 3 crore for the government if most commercial vehicles in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area were to switch over.

 The proposal follows a meeting of transport department officials with environment secretary Asim Barman and finance secretary Samar Ghosh at Writers? Buildings on January 27. 

 ?We have to offer transporters some incentives to convert to green fuel. We know the amount isn?t much, but it underlines the government?s sincerity in promoting green fuel in the city,? transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury said on Sunday. The proposal is pending clearance from the finance department.

 The government has been forced to take this step since there aren?t too many takers, especially among taxis, for the LPG kits on offer. Not a single taxi has converted to LPG so far, while only 10 new LPG taxis have been purchased in the past 10 months.

 According to Hindustan Motors officials, the prod from the government for conversion to LPG was lacking till recently. They cited the example of Delhi, which offered a 100 per cent sales tax waiver in order to push CNG in the public transport sector.

 ?We?ve priced LPG cars on a par with diesel Ambassadors. We?re also offering a discount of Rs 40,000 to the first 100 customers. We had hoped the government would come up with matching concessions to make the city greener,? said Ashwani Dubey, executive vice-president, Hindustan Motors. 

 The firm had recommended waiver of sales tax on LPG, which the state has ruled out, citing ?budget constraints?.

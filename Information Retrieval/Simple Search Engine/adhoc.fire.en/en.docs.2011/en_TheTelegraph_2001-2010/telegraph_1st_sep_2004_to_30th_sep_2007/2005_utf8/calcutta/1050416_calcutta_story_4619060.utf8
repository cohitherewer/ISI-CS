 Green suit for riverfront

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 A few social organisations have decided to file a public interest litigation (PIL) in Calcutta High Court, seeking the green bench?s intervention in beautifying the riverfront.

 ?Both the Central and the state governments have ignored our repeated appeals to remove the garbage dumps, old godowns and closed factories from the banks of the Hooghly,? said Subhas Dutta, general secretary of Howrah Ganatantrik Nagarik Samiti, one of the organisations spearheading the cause of the city?s environment.

 ?Now, we have decided to move court seeking an order asking the governments to take appropriate steps in this regard.? According to Dutta, Calcutta?s riverside has turned into a den of criminals. ?Both Howrah and Calcutta are deprived of the advantages enjoyed by riverside cities across the world,? he alleged.

 Recently, a survey conducted jointly by Howrah Ganatantrik Nagarik Samiti and Save Calcutta, another organisation, found that abandoned godowns and closed factories dot almost 60 per cent of the riverside areas on either bank of the Hooghly.

 ?Only the judiciary is considering the environment issues with sympathy and forcing the governments to act properly. The areas around Victoria Memorial Hall and Brigade Parade Grounds are being developed because of the court?s intervention,? said Ratan Roy, a member of Save Calcutta. ?So, we are hopeful that in this matter, too, the cour t will pass the necessary directives,? he added.

 As part of the first phase of a riverfront beautification programme undertaken by the urban development ministry earlier, Millennium Park was constructed.

 An official of the department said: ?The government is well aware that beautification of the riverfront is a necessity. That is why our department had undertaken certain programmes.? Calcutta Port Trust (CPT), which controls a portion of the riverfront, also claims to have beautification plans.

 ?We have been hearing about the government and CPT?s plans for the past 10 years. We want beautification of the entire area,? said Dutta.

 He will also plead with the court to ask the authorities to shift burning ghats from the riverside.

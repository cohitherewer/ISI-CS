 Campus cry for fast unto death

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Jadavpur University is back on the boil, with students of the engineering and technology faculty embarking on a fresh agitation to protest the decision to suspend five seniors.

 A fast-unto-death from June 12 and the boycott of the semester exams rescheduled for June 15 were the protest points chalked out on Friday. 

 The semester exams, earlier scheduled for end-April, had also been boycotted.

 The faculty of engineering and technology students? union (Fetsu) organised a series of meetings on campus over the past three days to finalise an action plan. 

 ?The meetings of the general body are on and we will be in a position to finalise our decision on the second phase of the movement only after taking into account the opinion of as many students as possible,? said a Fetsu leader.

 The call for the second round of protests by Fetsu is a serious cause for concern on campus for the university authorities and officials of the state higher education department.

 ?We are monitoring the developments in Jadavpur University through media reports. We have so far not stepped in to tackle the students? agitation, as it is being handled by the university, an autonomous body. But we may have to intervene if the situation on campus worsens,? state higher education minister Satyasadhan Chakraborty said on Friday.

 Sources in the government said the turmoil at Jadavpur University was recently discussed at a meeting of senior officials of the higher education department. The report of the one-man inquiry committee, on the basis of which the five students were suspended, was also deliberated upon.

 On campus, confusion and tension reigned. ?We are shocked by the reports on the fresh movement by Fetsu. It is surprising that the students did not inform us about their decision even after we saw media reports about their agitation ending,? said Manoj Mitra, dean of the varsity?s engineering and technology faculty.

 ?It is time the students concentrated on their studies and realised the consequences if they unnecessarily start a fresh movement,? added the university?s acting registrar Subir Chakraborty.

 Boost for bird haven

 SANJAY MANDAL

 It has been a haven for more than 100 species of birds and animals for decades, but was in danger of being converted into a housing estate. However, the chief minister?s intervention has saved the day for Koyaler Bagan, in Narendrapur.

 On finding out that the area could not be turned into a sanctuary due to lack of funds, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee asked the finance department to disburse Rs 3 crore to the forest department so that the 18-acre plot could be bought from the owners. 

 ?The conversion of the plot into a bird sanctuary will start soon,? said Atanu Kumar Raha, director of the Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve, on Thursday. ?The West Bengal Forest Development Corporation will be entrusted with the task.?

 In addition to setting up an ecological park, there are plans to dig a pool and grow fruit trees to attract more birds. The entire area will be fenced to protect the animals and birds. 

 ?The sanctuary will be the nearest to the city, hardly 10 kilometres from its heart,? observed Raha.

 Civet, mongoose, jackal, jungle cat and various reptiles and amphibians are found at Koyaler Bagan. Kingfisher, woodpecker, parakeet, green pigeon, Crested Serpent Eagle, oriole, cuckooshrike, minivet, and drongo make up the bird population. A wide variety of butterflies can also be seen in abundance.

 Migratory birds, mainly from the Himalayas, also fly in. These include Scaly Thrush, Tickell?s Thrush, Verditer Flycatcher, Tickell?s Blue Flycatcher and Grey-headed Canary Flycatcher. 

 ?There are very few places around the city where such a concentrated population of animals and birds can be seen,? stated Kushal Mukherjee, secretary of Prakriti Sansad. ?It is vital to save the spot to preserve Calcutta?s bio-diversity.? 

 V.K. Yadav, deputy chief wildlife warden of forest department, felt that once the land is acquired, it could be protected from encroachment. ?We will conduct an awareness programme with the help of NGOs,? he declared.

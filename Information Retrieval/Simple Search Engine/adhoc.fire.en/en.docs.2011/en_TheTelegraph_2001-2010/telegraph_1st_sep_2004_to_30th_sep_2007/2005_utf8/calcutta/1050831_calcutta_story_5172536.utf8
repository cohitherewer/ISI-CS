 Curtain code for passion play

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 RED RULES: The southern part of the house that is connected with name, fame and recognition is best energised by hanging red curtains. They bring passion back into a marriage when hung in the south-west corner of the bedroom

 Q: I have been growing money plants in my house for the last four years. Some believe that they bring in wealth, while others say they invite diseases. Please guide me on this and also the directions they should be placed in. I would also like to know whether hanging red curtains in the house is Feng Shui-friendly.

 Meetali Das

 THE SOLUTION: Growing money plants in the house is fine and they are believed to bring wealth, as the name suggests. They do not bring diseases for sure. They are best placed in the east and south-eastern part of the house.

 Red is a vibrant colour that suggests liveliness. But caution should be taken that it is used in moderation, as overdose of it can be too strong. 

 The southern part of the house that is connected with name, fame and recognition is best energised by red curtains. They bring passion back into a marriage when hung in the south-west corner of the bedroom. 

 Cabinet call

 Q: We will be moving to a new house in a few months. We are getting the interiors done now and would like to carry a large cabinet from the present house that would store a television set, music system and crystal decorative pieces. I also have some beautifully-framed mirrors and a very heavy stone sculpture that depicts a couple dancing. Please suggest their proper placements in the new house so that they bring in good luck. 

 Sharda Agarwal

 THE SOLUTION: The large cabinet can be placed against the west wall of the living area. This is the best place for television and music system. Add some silver artefacts with the crystal pieces as the ruling element of this area is metal.

 Mirrors can be best placed on the northern and eastern walls of the living and dining areas and in the corridors, hallways and narrow passages. 

 They bring positive energy in abundance when they are made to reflect a beautiful view from outside. Care should be taken so that they dont face the main entrance.

 Door dilemma

 Q: We live in a flat where the entrance is from the south-west. A big portion of this area falls out of the house, which is the common area for other flat-owners. Please guide as to how the entrance can be made auspicious as I have heard that entering a house from the south-west is not good.

 Manasi Gupta

 THE SOLUTION: South-west is ruled by earth energy, which is known for its steadiness and stability. Placing the main entrance here is usually not recommended as the constant movement in this area destabilises it. 

 The positive way to look at it is that this area being connected with marriage encourages happy marital energy to flow in. Extend this area by installing a large mirror on the interior west wall of the south-west corner. You can spread an earthy-coloured floor covering outside the entrance to include the cut corner. 

 Personalise this space by adorning the walls with beautiful paintings, placing heavy terracotta or stone pots with potted plants near the entrance. Do not forget to illuminate this area well in the evening.

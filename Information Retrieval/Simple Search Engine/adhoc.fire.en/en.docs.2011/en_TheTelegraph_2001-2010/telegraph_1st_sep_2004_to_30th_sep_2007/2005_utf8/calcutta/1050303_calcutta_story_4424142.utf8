 Environmentalist Sunita Narayan, 12-year-old Shukla Mondal of Dhapa, legal activist M.C. Mehta, middle-aged clerk Bapan Das... What binds the disparate individuals is a concern for the environment. And all of them had turned up at the recently-concluded, four-day-long green fair at Science City, where the organisers had recorded a footfall of 25,000. 

 Buoyed by the response, the West Bengal Pollution Control Board has decided to make the fair an annual event. ?The response has exceeded our expectations. Even people from the other states are curious about it,? said board chief Sudip Banerjee.

 While several industrial units demonstrated ?live? how they control toxic emissions and effluents, government agencies such as All-India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health explained to visitors the technique of detecting arsenic in drinking water.

 The stalls of non-government and voluntary organisations were major crowd-pullers. An official explained: ?Most people still believe that the industrial units do not practise what they preach regarding environment. On the other hand, they feel connected with non-government and voluntary groups.?

 Among such organisations, some stood out for their variety, some for innovativeness, while most excelled in presentation.

 Gontra caught the imagination of the visitors for their display of paddy seeds that are fast becoming extinct. City-based Environment Governed Integrated Organisation tried to present the views of the common people, especially of the urban poor, on issues related to environment and health.

 Sabujer Abhijan, from Chandernagore (which has the distinction of organising the state?s first green fair), was unique in documenting the effect of war and other military activities on the environment. Bhadreswar Municipality showcased the working of its cost-effective bio-gas crematorium. 

 While the visitors were unanimous in hailing the fair, they also pointed out a few drawbacks. ?People manning the government stalls did not seem happy responding to the visitors? queries. Perhaps, they considered it beyond their call of duty to sit in the stalls for such long periods,? alleged Krishna Das, a resident of Bansdroni. 

 Green activist Subhas Dutta felt the pollution control board could have roped in a few more experts. Another visitor complained that most seminars were ?technical?. For an average visitor, he said, the organisers could have held interactive sessions.

 Admitting to the drawbacks, a board official said: ?It was an inaugural effort and we can only improve.?

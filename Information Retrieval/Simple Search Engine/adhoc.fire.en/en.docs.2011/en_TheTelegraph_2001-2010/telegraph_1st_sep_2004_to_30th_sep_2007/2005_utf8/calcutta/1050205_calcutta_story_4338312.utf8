 Bail for in-laws in suicide wrangle

 R.VENKATARAMAN IN NEW DELHI

 The Supreme Court on Friday granted bail to the accused in the Chandni Agarwal suicide case. The order followed an intervener?s application by Chandni?s father, Joginder Bansal, who sought cancellation of the anticipatory bail granted to her in-laws. 

 Chandni was married into a Calcutta-based family. Her parents stay in Ludhiana. 

 She committed suicide in October 2002, allegedly after being tortured by her husband Gaurav and in-laws for dowry. The defence team, however, is arguing that she had been suffering from mental disorders.

 While delivering the ruling, the division bench of Justice N. Santosh Hegde and Justice S.B. Sinha said it had restricted itself to the question of whether the accused deserved bail. 

 The merits of the case ? whether torture by the in-laws was responsible for Chandni?s death ? would be dealt with by the trial court. 

 The defence had claimed that Chandni had been treated for ?schizophrenic psychotic depressions? and that she had attempted to commit suicide more than once. 

 The judges pointed out that both sides were trying to ?create documents? to vindicate their arguments and claims. The ?correctness? of the documents, they observed, could be examined only during a ?full-fledged trial?.

 The court ordered the accused to furnish a bail bond of one lakh rupees each and a surety for the same amount, to the satisfaction of the trial court or the arresting authority. The media was cautioned not to try case itself. 

 Referring to a feature Doomed by Dowry, which appeared in a local magazine, the bench stated: ?Materials therein (in the write-up) are all that may be used in the forthcoming trial in the case and we have no hesitation that this type of articles appearing in the media would certainly interfere with the administration of justice.?

 The judged warned the publisher and the editor of the magazine, and the writer of the piece as well, against conducting a ?trial by the media?, especially when the issue is sub-judice.

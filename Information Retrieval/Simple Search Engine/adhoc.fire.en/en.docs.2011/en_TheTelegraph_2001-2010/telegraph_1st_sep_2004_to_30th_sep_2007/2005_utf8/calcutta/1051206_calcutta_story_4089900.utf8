 What: Aaja Gunaah Karle, a Bollywood theme night.

 Where: Tantra.

 When: Saturday night.

 D?cor: The entrance was done up with posters from old Hindi films ? Caravan to China Gate. Actors from yesteryears smiled down on the crowd that was jostling and nudging its way in. 

 Crowd: For a change, the family factor ? uncles, aunties, bhaiyyas and bhabhis ?took over from the teeny boppers. 

 E-quotient: It was not till midnight that Ashiana, Harshada and Shivangi, specially flown in from Mumbai, decided to burn the bar-top with their sizzling steps. The reveal revelry kicked off with Piya tu ab to aaja and the mercury rose with steamier stuff as the mobile cameras worked overtime. One of the dancers threw Tantra into a real tizzy with her predictably provocative moves to Choli ke peechhe kya hai.

 Liquor mix

 What: The launch party of Pine Cask beverages.

 Where: The Park banquets.

 When: Saturday night.

 E-quotient: The party started with a stand-up comic act by Mir. The climax of the evening comprised the dance numbers performed by Sanobar Kabir of Meri beri ke ber fame. She moved to hit numbers like Dhoom machale, Dus bahane and Kajra re.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Sporty feel in feet fashion

The comfort factor and casual appeal of 

sneakers make them the most preferred footwear both on the field and off it. Zeeshan 

Jawed finds out what the big brands have to offer in this segment

Whether you?re a sports freak seriously into cricket 

or soccer, a fitness enthusiast doing jogging rounds of the neighbourhood park 

daily or a cool cat flaunting your denims with a kurti ? a pair of sneakers 

is most likely to adorn your feet on every occasion. Meant primarily to be sportswear, 

sneakers today have become universal in their appeal. The comfort factor, combined 

with the casual appeal, makes it the preferred choice of footwear among men and 

women of various age groups.

In Calcutta, till about a decade ago, the hunt for 

sneakers would take you on a trek down Bentinck Street or Esplanade. But thanks 

to international sportswear labels, as well as local footwear brands, men are 

now spoilt for choice in this segment. While fairly comfortable sneakers in attractive 

colours are on offer from good ol? Bata or local player Khadim?s, if you are looking 

for more advanced features for specific sports, you should ideally opt for sports 

majors like Nike, Adidas and Reebok. Not only do these offer a larger variety, 

special features incorporated in the footwear also ensure better care for your 

feet.

?Before purchasing a pair of sneakers one must make 

sure that it fits well. The arches should be perfect and there has to be sufficient 

space near the toes. The most important aspect is the air sole as it absorbs all 

the friction while running or jogging. Regular friction, if not absorbed properly, 

can put stress on the feet, ankle, legs and spine, which in due course might lead 

to arthritis,? warns orthopaedic surgeon Arindam Ganguly.

The other major problem that?s taken care of by the 

big brands is that of foot odour. ?Any attempt to reduce foot odour has to address 

both the feet and the shoe. There should be proper ventilation on top of or inside 

the sneakers so that the sweat evaporates fast before it interacts with the bacteria 

in the shoes. Regular accumulation of sweat can lead to fungal feet infection,? 

cautions Ganguly.

Both Nike and Adidas have shoes with technology that 

prevents foul air emanating from the feet. The Nike sneakers have breathable mesh 

fixed on the upper part of the shoe that facilitates constant air regulation, 

while the Clima-cool ones from Adidas facilitate 360-degree ventilation.

Goodlife tries out various kinds of sneakers...

Multiple use

Cross-training sneakers is the most popular variety 

for its all-purpose usage. These can be worn as easily off the field as on it, 

but not for all kinds of professional sports. This variety is ideal for casual 

wear as well as during workout sessions, meeting the basic comfort level and providing 

cushioning, stability and durability. They are not recommended if you are actively 

into running or jogging since the cross-training shoes are heavier than normal 

running shoes. Moreover, they do not provide the level of cushioning and flexibility 

required for power running. Sneakers meant for running should be very light and 

flexible and it?s important to get the size and weight just right.

?An ideal cross-training shoe has air capsules inside 

the sole, so the body weight doesn?t fall on the sole but on the air capsules. 

As a result, it provides a certain level of cushioning,? says Amlan Chowdhury, 

store manager, Nike, in Forum. The cross-training shoes are available at all the 

outlets of Adidas, Nike and Reebok. Prices start from Rs 2,500.

Specific sports

If you are actively into cricket, you are required 

to own a pair of sneakers that suit your needs. And if you are an all-rounder 

at that, you ought to own three different kinds. ?The spikes under the shoes for 

batting, bowling and fielding are very different. All the three activities require 

different types of grips on the ground,? says Sandeep Chopra of Adidas.

The batting shoes have rubber spikes so that the batsman 

does not harm the pitch while running; bowling shoes have metal spikes for better 

grip while running in; fielding shoes have both rubber (towards the toe) and metal 

spikes (on the heels). These shoes are available at all Adidas outlets, priced 

upwards of Rs 3,999.

The requirements for soccer shoes are very different 

from that for other sports, as these have to be extra tough. Soccer sneakers come 

in two materials: leather and synthetic. The material you choose depends on the 

level of the game you will be playing, your skill and the weather of the place 

your are in. 

?Soccer involves a lot of running around. Moreover, 

we also have to hit the ball quite hard. The footwear really has to be very tough 

to take the strain,? says soccer player Douglas D?Silva. But the footballer opts 

for less tough varieties when he flaunts them at a party. ?I usually prefer to 

wear sneakers even when I am going for a party. I have quite a few pairs that 

I match with my shirts. The cushioning and right fit is very important to me,? 

he adds.

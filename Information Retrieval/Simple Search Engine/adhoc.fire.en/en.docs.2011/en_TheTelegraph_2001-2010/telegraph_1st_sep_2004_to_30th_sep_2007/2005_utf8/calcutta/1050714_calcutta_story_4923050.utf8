 New-age envoys bring Tagore to small screen

 SUDESHNA BANERJEE

 Picturisation of a Rabindrasangeet in Farmhouse

 ?Amra nutan joubaneri doot?? It is not the ship-wrecked prince and merchant introducing themselves in Tagore?s dance drama Tasher Desh but a pack of urban youngsters singing outside a village farmhouse to bring a romantic tale to a happy ending.

 Tagore is turning out to be a safe bet for small-screen directors who are using his music in their serials or films ? in most cases on their own terms.

 The latest in this line is Farmhouse, which is set to be beamed on Tara Muzik. The telefilm has seven songs in 80 minutes of screentime. Of them, four are Rabindrasangeets. 

 ?Tagore is appropriate for modern love stories as well. But the application has been lacking in the way it has been sung over the years. We are merging Rabindrasangeet with youthful energy and smartness,? says director Arindam Dey. 

 So there will be Shankar Chakraborty marching in and saluting his lady love to the beat of Premero joarey bhashale dohare in military gear (he is an army personnel). ?A dhoti-clad bare-torsoed Bajrasen is what the song reminds us of. To break away from that visual image, we have used an orchestrated feel with string arrangements and drums while keeping the tune intact. If Shakespeare?s Romeo and Juliet is accepted in a mafia world in the Leonardo di Caprio-Claire Danes film, why can we not overcome our touchiness about Tagore if no disrespect is shown?? argues singer Neepabithi Ghosh, who is in charge of the music in Farmhouse. 

 Indranil Sen, among the busiest of today?s Bengali vocalists, is ?relieved? that Rabindrasangeet is being used so frequently for playback. ?Have you heard the kind of language that passes off as lyrics in Bengali films??

 Sen points out that Tagore?s repertoire is so mature that there are choices of songs for every emotion and situation. 

 There are practical considerations too. ?It comes cheaper. You don?t have to pay either a composer or a lyricist. Often it so happens that a situation has not been picturised with a Rabindrasangeet in mind, but at the last moment one is pushed in,? Sen says.

 Says Rupankar, who has sung a parody of Kharabayu boy bege for a fishing sequence in Farmhouse and is about to release a Rabindrasangeet album: ?Tagore has been heard earlier in serials like Tero Parbon and Sonar Sansar but what is novel about this new wave is that voices not known to sing Rabindrasangeet are being used.?

 The effect is there on the screen ? fresh arrangements, new styles of singing and innovative picturisation, yet Tagore nonetheless. ?He is so close to our heart that it becomes easy to connect to the audience,? says Neepabithi.

 Healthcare charts new territory

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 From a state-of-the-art eye hospital and nursing college to infection imaging and radio frequency ablation facilities ? hospitals in Calcutta are breaking new ground in healthcare.

 First up is Calcutta Medical Research Institute, which is investing nearly Rs 2 crore in a specialised eye-care facility. LV Prasad Eye Institute is its collaborator in the project.

 ?We are starting the department on November 1. Once it?s up and running, we want to build an eye-care hospital,? said Amit De, chief executive officer of Calcutta Medical Research Institute.

 AMRI Hospitals is also in expansion mode, with a nursing college coming up in a separate building across the main facility. ?The building is ready at a cost of Rs 2 crore. The college is expected to be inaugurated early next year,? said AMRI president S.B. Purakayastha.

 Another Rs 1.5 crore will have to be spent to make the college operational.

 Eko X-ray and Imaging Institute has already launched its fusion and infection imaging facilities.

 In fusion imaging, the anatomic information obtained through CT scan or MRI is combined with functional data from gamma cameras. The images can be obtained promptly, enabling quick diagnosis and treatment.

 Fusion imaging is a recent advance in nuclear medicine. Doctors hope it will pave the way for molecular imaging. 

 Infection imaging, on the other hand, utilises radio labelled white blood cells (WBCs) to pinpoint the site of infection, when other imaging options fail. 

 The new technique is extremely useful for diagnosing fever of unknown origin, bone and joint infections, infected prosthetic joints and inflammatory bowel diseases. 

 The procedure involves separation of the white blood cells (WBCs) from the other components in a blood sample drawn from the patient, and radio labelling them. The labelled WBCs are injected in the patient?s bloodstream.

 ?We have received the approval of the Atomic Regulatory Board of India to practise these image modalities. It has been our endeavour to provide state-of-the-art facilities to the people in the city,? Dr S.K. Sharma, director of EKO said.

 With liver cancer emerging as the primary form of cancer, Apollo Gleneagles Hospital has introduced a technique known as radiofrequency ablation to treat the disease.

 ?The facility has been made available for the first time in this part of the country. It will be a boon for critical patients,? opined Dr Mahesh Goenka, head, Institute of Gastroenterology at Apollo.

 Electricity of radio frequency range from 200 to 1,200 Khz is used to treat patients during the procedure. Electrodes are inserted into the tumour before the power is switched on. The electricity causes ionisation or separation of tissues into positive and negatively charged particles, leading to frictional collision resulting in generation of considerable heat. The heat causes destruction of the tumour.

 Carlifter arrested

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Liluah police on Tuesday arrested Raju Rai, from Bihar, for involvement in an inter-state carlifting racket. 

 Superintendent of Howrah police Mihir Bhattacharya said the cops raided a hideout in the morning after receiving a tip-off that Rai and his associates had assembled there. 

 Two false number-plates, lock-breaking equipment and a bunch of master keys were seized from the hideout. 

 ?We are interrogating Rai for information about the others involved in the racket,? Bhattacharya added. 

 Rai, a resident of Vaishali (Bihar), was reportedly associated with the gang for more than five years.

 Job shun for challenged candidate 

 SANJAY MANDAL

 A physically-challenged youth has been knocking on the doors of the railway authorities with his appointment letter for four long years, but, despite a court order, is being denied a job.

 Raja Mitra of Baranagar, with 40 per cent hearing impairment, received an appointment letter for a Group D post from the South Eastern Railway (SER) on January 11, 2001. The authorities of the Chakradharpur division of SER, however, refused to let him join on the plea that the rules regarding candidates with hearing impairment had changed since Raja applied.

 The Calcutta bench of the Central Administrative Tribunal has recently issued an order, directing SER to immediately employ Raja. ?The rules applicable for the applicant are the rules that existed at the time of issue of the advertisement for vacancies,? the judges observed in their order.

 ?We are looking into the matter. It has to be seen whether there is a need to move a higher court,? an SER spokesperson said on Sunday.

 Raja?s family is frustrated over the stalemate. ?We have fought for four years and even after a court order in my son?s favour, he has not been allowed to join work,? lamented A.K. Mitra, Raja?s father. 

 Mitra, who is retired, used up the money he had saved for his daughter?s marriage to fight the case.

 When Raja had applied for the SER job, those with 40 per cent to 70 per cent hearing impairment were being considered for Group D posts by the authorities. 

 Raja, as per the medical certificate issued by RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, had 45 per cent hearing impairment and, therefore, was eligible to apply for Group D posts under the physically-handicapped quota.

 A subsequent medical test at Central Hospital of the railway, in Garden Reach, revealed that Raja was suffering from 40 per cent hearing impairment. After a written test, followed by an interview, he was empanelled under the handicapped quota and received his appointment letter.

 The problems started after Raja was declared ineligible for jobs under the hearing handicapped quota, as per the changed rules.

 He wrote to the Chakradharpur authorities seeking reconsideration. When he received no reply, he moved the central tribunal, which, in January 2002, directed the railway authorities to consider Raja?s application. He later filed a petition before the Calcutta bench of the tribunal in 2004.

 During the hearing, railway lawyers submitted that there were other candidates with a greater degree of hearing impairment than Raja and so his appointment was cancelled.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 IT, tourism boom fuels airport take-off

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Calcutta airport is in the fast lane ? thanks to the IT and tourism boom in the state. 

 ?The flourishing of the IT and tourism industries in the state has contributed significantly to the growth of the airport,? Rajendra Pal, airport director, told Metro.

 While the international aircraft movement at the airport has increased by 14.2 per cent, the domestic sector has registered a 9.2 per cent hike.

 There has been a 7.8 per cent increase in the number of passengers travelling abroad from Calcutta airport compared to the previous year and a 13 per cent increase in the number of passengers taking domestic flights from the airport during the same period. 

 Officials said the favourite destinations of the international passengers were south, Southeast and West Asia, and Europe. 

 ?The competitive rates offered by airlines are also luring passengers,? observed Anil Punjabi, chairman (east), Travel Agents Federation of India.

 In Southeast Asia, Bangkok, Malaysia, Singapore, Colombo and Maldives emerged as the most favoured destinations, while London, Paris and Frankfurt were the favourite tourist spots in Europe. In West Asia, the majority of the passengers travelled to Dubai last year, said Punjabi. 

 According to officials, the airfares to these destinations have come down by almost 40 to 50 per cent compared to last year. 

 Capacity enhancement has also contributed to the growth in passengers. All the airlines operating in Southeast Asia have increased the number of flights and their capacities.

 Thai Airways has increased operations to Southeast Asia from three to five flights a week, while Indian Airlines has increased weekly operations to Bangkok and Yangon from five to eight. The hikes for Singapore Airlines and Druk Air have been from two to four and from two to five, respectively.

 In addition, Malaysia Airlines has introduced five weekly flights from Calcutta. 

 Officials predict that the number of passengers and aircraft movement will grow even more during 2005.

 Air India (AI) is planning to start operations to Southeast Asia next year. ?We have plans to offer flights to Southeast Asia. Hopefully, things will be finalised soon,? confirmed an AI official over phone from Mumbai. The airline is set to start its direct flight to London from June 4.

 Thai Airways, too, has plans to add to its flights from the city from November this year. Airline officials, however, refused comment on the issue.

 ?More people are now travelling from Calcutta to various places in Southeast Asia. Both leisure and business traffic is increasing steadily,? a Thai Airways spokesperson said. 

 He added that a lot of bookings are being done from Calcutta on the Bangkok-New York flight of the airline started this month.

 ?This shows how fast the passenger traffic from the city is growing,? he commented.

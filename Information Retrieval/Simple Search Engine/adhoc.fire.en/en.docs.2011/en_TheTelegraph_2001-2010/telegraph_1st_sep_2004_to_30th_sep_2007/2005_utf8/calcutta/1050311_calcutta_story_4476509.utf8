 Canvas of humanity

 The role of mankind in the universal scheme of things has been the subject of discourse of almost all great thinkers and philosophers. Characterised by a profound desire to comprehend the course of collective human destiny, the art works of Madhubanti Banerjee (The Man; picture left) and Dip Banerjee also provide viewing pleasure by virtue of their simplicity of style and a natural, spontaneous expression. The ongoing exhibition of their paintings and drawings represents a tribute to humanity by the two artists, who have the highest veneration for the value of human life. Inspired by the ?still, sad music of humanity?, the works on show, lyrical and elegiac in tone, texture and temper, attempt to put into perspective the universal human condition. A mood of meditation, introspection and contemplation mark all their characters, who, interestingly, look towards science and learning as the means through which they can improve their lot.

 Event: Exhibition of paintings by Madhubanti Banerjee and Dip Banerjee

 When: Till March 12, 3 pm - 8 pm

 Where: Academy of Fine Arts, New South Gallery

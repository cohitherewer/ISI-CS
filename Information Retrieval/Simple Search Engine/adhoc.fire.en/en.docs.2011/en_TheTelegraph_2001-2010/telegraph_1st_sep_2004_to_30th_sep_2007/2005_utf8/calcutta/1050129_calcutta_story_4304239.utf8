P24 Kanungo Park, opposite Padmashree cinema near 

Garia, may seem an unlikely address for a meal stop, but that?s just the way it 

is. For, Dishes is the effort of a young couple promising to offer ?proper dining 

facilities? to a part of the city starved of food stops.

 Owners Indraneel and wife Rupannita, both residents of the area, have cooked up this 24-seater Continental and Chinese destination to fill in the blank for eat-out options in zone Garia. 

 ?We never seemed to find a place to go out for a quick weekend lunch or dinner. We thought there must be other people as well who share our predicament, especially a lot of young, working couples who live in the area,? shares Indraneel. ?With the Udita apartments just a five-minute drive away, we are getting a lot of footfall and home delivery offers as well,? adds Rupannita.

 Done up with fancy furniture, subdued lighting and vibrant, textured walls, the food point looks fetching. The menu comprises everything from momos, Korean Fried Rice, Shepherd?s Pie to Fish and Chips in Tartar Sauce. Garlic-flavoured Noodles, an in-house speciality, is a hot favourite, followed by Chicken Black Pearl and Prawn Schezwan, all rustled up by chef Uttam Kallabi. 

 And to top it off there is Honey Noodles served with a scoop of ice cream.

Wood work

 Gone are the days when doing up your house meant the ubiquitous trek down BB Ganguly Street or hobnobbing with the neighbourhood carpenter. The mushrooming of branded and upmarket furniture stores has made setting up home a lot smoother ? and smarter.

 Usha Lexus at 62B Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Road is another stop to consider while on the furniture trail. On offer here is a wide range of comfortable and stylish sofa sets, smart and compact bar cabinets, bookshelves, magazine racks, side tables and much more.

 One can choose from various packages available here, conceptualised by students of National Institute of Design. These include the international Heritage Range, the sophisticated Oriental package, the glamorous Louis XIV Range, the comfortable Manhattan package and the all-wooden Manhattan Classic. Usha Lexus has also introduced imported leather sofa sets in stylish black and classy camel textures.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fly out further, cheaper

 - Carrier offers summer tourist round trip to Kuala Lumpur for Rs 8,000

 Rs 3,999.50 for a one-way ticket to ? no, not Delhi by the Rajdhani, but to Kuala Lumpur by Singapore Airlines.

 With the price in the sky plummeting further, an increase in connectivity, a rise in the number of flights and frequency, Calcuttans have more reasons than ever before to fly high and fly further. Most flights are full this summer holiday season. But the special offers, schemes, discounts and promotional fares just keep falling from the skies.

 The latest in line is Singapore Airlines, which operates four non-stop flights a week from Calcutta (on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays). The carrier has been continually cutting fares to most destinations from Calcutta. Now on offer is a round trip to Kuala Lumpur for Rs 8,000.

 Singapore City, Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur have been competing for low fares, on the wings of their national carriers. And it just got cheaper this summer, giving Calcuttans further incentive to go international rather than scramble for apex fares to make national travel pocket-friendly.

 ?With a round trip to Bangkok, on Indian Airlines, costing around Rs 7,500, it just does not make sense planning holidays within the country. And the Calcutta traveller is catching on to this international-travel trend,? said Manish Sood, director sales and marketing, Giananey Travels and Tours.

 Through June and July, Singapore Airlines has a special offer to Kuala Lumpur, London and New York, with the seats limited in numbers, dates and flights. ?Most flights are full, but on those where there are seats available, we will have say three or four flights for that fare. If you call your travel agent, they?ll look it up on the system. If you?re fast enough, then you can grab the seats at the lowest price,? explains Bharat Mahadevan, manager, eastern India, Singapore Airlines.

 The Lucky Fares offer, effective from June 3, will find around 10 seats up for grabs this month ? the peak season ? to be almost doubled in July. The scheme also applies to London, with a round trip at Rs 24,999, and to New York for Rs 39,999.

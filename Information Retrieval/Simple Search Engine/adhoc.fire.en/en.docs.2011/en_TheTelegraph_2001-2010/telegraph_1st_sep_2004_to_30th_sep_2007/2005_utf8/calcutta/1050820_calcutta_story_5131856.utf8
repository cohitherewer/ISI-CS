 Colours of life

 Capturing the myriad colours of life on canvas, Raga ? harmony of colours, the ongoing exhibition of paintings, attempts to understand the core values and ideas that dominate contemporary life. Featuring works by Apurba Biswas (one of his paintings appears left), Ashok Adhikary, Saumya Kanti Mukhopadhyay and Shantanu Banerjee, the show offers an interesting insight into life through a study of its various moods, manners and expressions. More than a critical survey of the human world, the exhibition brings to focus the conflicts, discords and disparities by which it is characterised. The paintings on show depict qualities like virtue, piety and compassion alongside flaws in human nature that manifest themselves in corruption, depravity and immorality. The artists, nevertheless, retain an archetypal faith in humanity, which is evident in their celebration of human relationships and of the simple, everyday activities of life.

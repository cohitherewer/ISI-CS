The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Reconstruct route for remedy 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Mrinal Chakraborty (name changed on request) had to have his jaws removed after a malignancy was detected in his mouth. Thanks to micro-vascular reconstruction (MVR), he now has a new set of jaws and is leading a normal life.

 The spread of cosmetic surgery in the city is proving to be a boon not only for oral cancer patients, but those suffering from other types of trauma-related disfigurement. 

 ?Reconstructive surgery was uncommon in Calcutta even a few years back. But it is fast becoming a regular feature,? said city-based plastic surgeon Arun Ganguli. 

 In case of head and neck cancer, the oral cavity and lymph nodes of the neck are removed. The general procedure involves amputation of a part, followed by its reconstruction, using portions from the neck, hand or chest. 

 With the help of MVR, a single-stage procedure, any part of the body can be reconstructed in its entirety. As part of the surgery, arteries are joined with tissues taken from various parts of the body.

 According to surgical oncologist Goutam Mukhopadhyay, MVR has been gaining ground fast. ?It gives excellent results and comes in handy where routine reconstructive procedures are found wanting. In case of major resections for head-neck cancer, not just survival, but quality of life is a major issue,? stated Mukhopadhyay. 

 MVR is effective for congenital birth defects, like cleft lip and cleft palate, and for deformities in the external ear and facial injury. 

 Reconstructive surgery is being increasingly opted for in leading city hospitals following burns. Reconstruction of fingers and thumbs is also quite common. 

 ?If a person loses a finger, it is important that he preserves the severed part and the surgery is started within six hours,? said Rajan Tandon, plastic and hand surgeon.

 ?The severed portion of the body should be carried in a plastic bag, kept inside an ice-filled plastic container. The idea is not to allow direct contact of the part with the ice,? he explained.

 Apart from reconstructive surgeries, cosmetic surgery to improve appearance is also popular in the city. The number of facelifts, hair transplants, tummy tucks and breast reconstructions are increasing every month.

 ?We are also getting cases of male breast surgery (gynaecomastia). More and more men are approaching plastic surgeons for this kind of surgery,? said Aniruddha Bose, plastic, cosmetic and reconstructive surgeon.

 He had a word of caution. ?Cosmetic surgeries need good infrastructure and skilled doctors,? Bose stressed.

 The surgeon claimed that even people from the lower economic strata are availing of the benefits of cosmetic surgery.

 Among the hospitals, Belle Vue Clinic has started a super-speciality plastic and reconstructive surgery unit. Others that offer MVR include Apollo Gleneagles Hospital, AMRI, Woodlands, SSKM, CMRI, West Bank, Genesis and the Thakurpukur cancer hospital.

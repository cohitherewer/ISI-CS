 Table talk for workplace wonders

Feng Shui Matters

Pinky Kapoor

 The table in an office chamber should never be 

placed in the centre as this represents a floating arrangement. Ideally, it should 

be placed diagonal to the entrance with one side of the desk touching a wall

Q: I am a computer software developer and the 

office I occupy is quite spacious. There is a small balcony attached to it, which 

I want to include in the office space. Will this be in accordance with Feng Shui 

rules? Also advise me on the placement of the table here.

Srikant 

 The Solution: Balconies are usually projections from a building. Please ensure that you don?t land up sitting in the projected part. Doing so you will get segregated from the rest of the office and develop a feeling of insecurity. As a result you could lose authority over the office staff gradually. It is important to level out the floor so that it doesn?t slope towards the balcony. You should place the table in such a way that you sit diagonal to the entrance with one side of the desk touching the wall. But never place the table in the centre of the room as this floating arrangement symbolises a boat rocking in the middle of the ocean. Make sure that there is no passageway behind your chair. There shouldn?t be any doors or windows behind your chair. Also ensure that there is no mirror or toilet directly in front of or behind the table.

Q: I appeared for the Civil Services Exam in 

May last year. My date of birth is December 14, 1980. I would like to know whether 

I have chosen the right career for myself. I would also like to know whether my 

relationship corner is weak and if so, how I can strengthen it.

Manju Natarajan

 The Solution: According to your pillars of destiny, your metal element is very strong and this makes you a strong-headed person. You have a rigid mind that creates problems in maintaining relationships with people around. Keep away from a metallic environment and balance yourself with softer elements like water and wood. Fire element is also important for you, as it is powerful in controlling metal. You are making the right career choice. Introduce water element in the north of your house to boost your career, and wood in the east to strengthen relationships. 

Q: I am building a house in a posh locality 

on a plot facing east. I would like to utilise the maximum space for construction 

and leave little open area around. Please suggest some guidelines for getting 

optimum benefits from the plot.

Manjit Singh

 The Solution: With rising property costs buildings are being built without wasting even a single square foot of space. As a result the house is being deprived of vital breathing space. Open space in front of a house is known as a bright hall where the auspicious Chi collects in abundance before entering the house. It protects the house against the attack of winds and expands perspectives and futures of the residents. The open area should not be too spacious or too narrow. It should be in proportion to the size of the building. If it is too narrow it will limit opportunities flowing in. On the other hand, a very wide space will allow the Chi to disperse without entering the house. Ideally, it should not be more than three times the size of the house.

Q: Our elder son is getting married soon and 

he wants to accommodate a bed, wardrobes, a study table, a cabinet and a sitting 

arrangement in his room. Right now he has a small room and we occupy the master 

bedroom. But we are thinking of shifting to his room while he occupies ours.

Is this advisable? Also, which is the best direction 

for a master bedroom? 

Sudeep Kejriwal

 The Solution: You should not shift to a smaller room and vacate the present one for your son. Parents uprooting themselves from their present positions for the sake of their children is not considered auspicious. The master bedroom should always be occupied by elders, while children must stay in smaller rooms. The master bedroom should always be located in the south-west, which is the marriage direction. This keeps a couple residing in it happy and helps sustain harmonious relations with their children. Its door should never directly open to the main entrance, a long corridor, a bathroom or kitchen. There should not be any direct sky light or a dangling light above the bed. These symbolise danger that can manifest itself in the form of headaches and mental pressure.

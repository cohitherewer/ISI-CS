The taste of tradition treats

Tongue Twister 

Nondon Bagchi

An iftar meal, after the day-long fast 

during Ramazan, is practical and nutritious, creative and delicious, says musician 

and foodie Nondon Bagchi

at an iftar meal; Nondon Bagchi at the feast; one of the items from the 

spread 

In July 1999, while writing Taste Case ? an 

earlier avatar of Tongue Twister ? I had been invited on a particular Sunday, 

at lunchtime, to partake of a traditional Bohri meal of the kind that would mark 

a special occasion.

The meal was served on an enormous circular platter 

or thaal placed on a cloth ? dastarkhwan ? which was laid out on 

the carpet.

We sat around the thaal observing the correct 

order and manner of sitting ? it is not done to cross ones legs; they must 

be folded under, with hips resting on the heels, Japanese style, or with legs 

folded under, but slightly away to the right.

Prior to this there had been the ritual washing of 

the hands and the meal itself began with the youngest among us offering around 

a vessel of salt, a taste of which cleanses the taste buds, assists digestion 

and acts as a purifier. The same ritual was followed at the end of the meal.

The fare was varied and exotic, with sweet, sweet-and-sour 

and savoury items interspersed. There was Sodanna, Husseini Buti, Kalimra, Dal 

Chawal Paleeda, Mutton Kari Chawal, Kharak Ka Halwa and Hulba, a coolant and digestive 

whose origins can be traced to the cuisine of Yemen, which along with countries 

such as Egypt and Arabia, has elements in common with Bohra cuisine.

My host that day was Mudar Patherya, who usually gets 

in touch when something interesting is cooking ? not necessarily food. Mudar was 

in touch again recently ? hed had the excellent idea of asking me around 

to the house of a friend of his to partake of an iftar meal, which is taken 

after day-long fasting during the month of Ramazan. A meal as prepared within 

a household of the Bohra community.

The two experiences were vastly different, though 

equally memorable. If the Sunday lunch was festive fare, the iftar meal 

was more austere; the emphasis was on appropriate nourishment, keeping in mind 

that whatever was eaten must not be harsh on the system. No rice or any form of 

bread was served for these would add bulk and ballast to the body. The idea was 

to have small portions packed with nutrients and to progress gradually, with the 

rich items coming last.

It made perfect sense, then, to start with a soothing, 

warm drink called Hareera, made with the milk blended with ground pistachios, 

almonds, butter and/or ghee and seasoning. Packed with goodness, subtle to taste 

and going down very well. Hareera is a centuries-old tradition and is also a refresher 

during long nights of prayer in the month of Ramazan.

The thaal was arranged with about 18 different 

items in moderate quantities. No individual would of course have all, but one 

could choose and help oneself, moving through the milder to the stronger flavours. 

Dal nu Salad was an item in which nothing was cooked ? a combination of moong 

dal that had been soaked in water, chopped cucumbers, coriander leaves, green 

chillies, lemon juice and salt.

Chana Bateta was boiled chick peas (the smaller, darker 

variety) and boiled potatoes tossed with a chutney made with jaggery and tamarind 

and garnished with chopped onions. Sufoot is a dish formed in layers. The base 

is bread soaked in mustard-flavoured yoghurt. Then comes a layer of boiled minced 

mutton combined with spring onions, coriander leaves and seasoning and the dish 

is topped with boiled eggs, boiled potatoes and tomatoes. Dahi Kaleji is mutton 

liver boiled with ginger and garlic, salt and pepper and combined with yoghurt 

seasoned with chopped green chillies and coriander leaves.

A most unusual item was something simply called Korma, 

but bearing no resemblance to the dishes we associate with that name. This was 

dehydrated chicken ? chicken cooked with ginger, garlic, green chillies, salt 

and turmeric ? cooked and woked (dry-roasted on a griddle, I think), till all 

that is left is a fluffy, light residue that has a coarse powdery consistency. 

I had never had anything like it.

More familiar items were mutton or vegetable stuffed 

samosas, their envelopes wafer thin and crisp, Shami Kebabs, Bohri-style, 

that is cylindrical in shape, the mutton cooked with ginger garlic, green chillies 

and salt, ground to a paste, shaped, dipped in egg, crumbed and fried.

There was also Dal Pakoras, Bateta Pies (mashed potato 

shaped around a stuffing of minced meat, egged and crumbed and fired) and also 

another crumb-fried item made with mutton ribs.

Among sweets there were dates stuffed with a mix of 

pistachios, almonds and reduced milk and an item called Sev na Laddoo ? a delicious, 

not over-sweet item made by shaping into spheres a combination of fine vermicelli, 

reduced milk, ground almonds and pistachios.

This item was typical of Surat, the city from which 

the first members of the Bohra community came here, more than 150 years ago. They 

came to be known as Bengaliwallas and this even evolved into a surname. They came 

as traders in mainly textiles and hardware. By 1890, the census stood at 90 people 

and although I am not aware of what was the maximum figure, I am told that at 

present it is just below 4,000. In between, some traders also established a connection 

between Calcutta and Kobe in Japan to set up a safety match factory in Calcutta. 

Memories of my iftar meal will stay for a long 

time. Practical, scientific, highly nourishing without being over-filling and 

at the same time creative and delicious.

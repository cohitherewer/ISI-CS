Life

 Crossover sound

 In town recently, singer Jay Sean spoke to Pratim D. Gupta about his childhood influences, a brush with Bollywood and the forthcoming album

He didnt get to perform at Fusion (for a visa problem!) during his recent trip to Calcutta, but his mere presence in the crowd sent the winter Celsius soaring. As his hit tracks blared in the background, Jay Sean pranced around the Golden Park restobar to hoots and whistles that would do a Bollywood star proud.

 Few are aware that the handsome hip-hop star could have become just another anonymous doctor in some UK clinic. But Kamaljit Jhoothi ? yes, thats his real name ? had other things to do.

 So he gave up a career in medicine and took up music, instead. See, studying medicine is a realistic dream, says Sean. You know, you get your grades and you are in. But music is more of a gamble. To get a recording deal with a major label was a big challenge, he explains.

 It was not until age 11 that Sean found his footing in the world of music. His grandfather was the only singer in the family, so Sean was exposed to all kinds of music, especially Bollywood. 

 I remember during my childhood days in England, I was privileged (!) enough to listen to songs from Hindi films like Aashiqui and Saajan, and, of course, all the Amitabh Bachchan movies, he recalls. 

 Then again, growing up in an English atmosphere, I also listened to a rich cocktail of music ? rap, rock and R amp;B.

 But when it came to his own music, Sean started straightaway with hip-hop. Hip-hop made me write my music, he says.

 I found that I was writing my own song lyrics for the first time. Now, Bhangra being part of our culture, that got into my music too. I always used to sing at home. When there would be relatives at my place, mom and dad would ask me to sing something...

 And somewhere from the sound of music was born Seans dream. I envisioned a day a young Asian would be singing in English on a global platform, he reveals. We have had plenty of Indian singers ? Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhonsle ? but none of them had actually sung in English. I wanted to be the first.

 That he became when Dance with you (Nachna tere naal) hit the charts everywhere from Mumbais hippest nightclubs to UKs urban underground. It was brilliant to have my songs playing at nightclubs and people dancing to it, smiles Sean. 

 Then the songs are also on the radio and everyones listening to them on the move. The most important thing was that my brand of music, a fusion so typical and obvious of two different cultures that I represent, became so popular.

 The music videos helped Sean tip the popularity scales and soon he was wooing Bipasha Basu, no less, in the Stolen shoot.

 Whats more, he got to sing for an Indian movie, Kya Kool Hai Hum. Bollywood is such a big part of Indian culture, something which brings Indians across the world together, he feels.

 Bollywood and chicken tikka, he adds. We all enjoy going and watching a Hindi film from time to time.

 So even as his agents try and strike a new Bollywood deal, Sean is set to launch his next album, Deal With It

 We are discussing which should be the first single to go on air and feature in the video, he says.

 Get ready for another round of Sean-tillating stuff!

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Actor, artist, musician...

 - project report

 All of 11 years old is Parag Bhatnagar (picture left), but the youngster is well on his way to fame, fortune and stardom. The St James student is currently playing the part of Waheeda Rehman?s grandson in Aparna Sen?s 15, Park Avenue. But the Class V student has other claims to fame, too. The Pokemon and Spiderman fan won the TTIS storytelling competition recently, and is also a prize-winner at inter-school creative writing contests. The budding actor is also an accomplished artist. He spent many a Sunday at Swabhumi ? on the management?s invitation ? sketching portraits of patrons for free. 

 Acting Parag describes as ?new, fascinating and exciting?, but his first love is art. The tabla is another hobby, which he learns in earnest and finished the first year with distinction. Parag has just finished filming for Rudra Dasgupta?s docu-feature on two brothers traumatised by terrorism, in which the youngster plays the lead role. His face is also on billboards and TV ads. It?s all in the family, with his younger brother Madhur, a Class II student, working with Prosenjit in the film Raju Uncle.

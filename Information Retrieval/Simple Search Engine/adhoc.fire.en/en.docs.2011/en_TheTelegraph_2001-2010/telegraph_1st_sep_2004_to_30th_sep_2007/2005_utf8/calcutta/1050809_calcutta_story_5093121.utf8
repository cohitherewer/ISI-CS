 Reese Witherspoon: Legally high

 She might have worn the very Indian earrings for the premiere of Mira Nair?s Vanity Fair but Reese Witherspoon is still best known as Elle Woods of Legally Blonde fame. And now Elle is back in the sequel to the successful movie in Legally Blonde 2: Red, White and Blonde, to be shown this Friday on the small screen.

 The film, which grossed $90,186,328 at the box-office, is all about animal rights. When Elle discovers that her beloved dog Bruser?s mother is being used for animal testing, she decides to go to Washington D.C. to get an anti-animal testing bill passed. Working at the office of Republican Senator Victoria Rudd (Sally Field), Elle quickly learns that to be heard in the capital, being yourself is the best.

 Even as you check out Reese?s moves as Elle on STAR Movies at 9 pm, watch out for the different wigs she sports in the film. Since Reese was just growing out her shorter hair from filming Sweet Home Alabama, she couldn?t shoot with her original hair. Also look out for those shoes, with Jimmy Choo, the shoe designer, making as many as 63 different pairs for the film, all out of man-made materials.

 Shahid and Ila: Mix and match 

 In the latest co-branding coup on the small screen, Fame Gurukul has tied up with Clinic All Clear shampoo making Shahid Kapur a part of the popular talent hunt on television. If you haven?t seen it already, the telly tube will soon be bombarded with the new commercial that has Shahid in a tete-a-tete with Gurukul headmistress Ila Arun. While Shahid says, ?Jo spotlight mein all clear, woh fame ke near?, Ila seconds him by saying, ?Jo all clear hain, use fame hum denge.?

 A new show on TV can help you buy a brand new washing machine worth Rs 20,000 for just Rs 20. Hosted by star comedian Sajid Khan, Super Sale on STAR One will feature three contestants challenging each other to collect Super Sale Rupees (SSR) and buying attractive items at special Super Sale Prices (SSP).

 Joining Sajid in this fun game show is Neeti Mohan, the multi-faceted singing star of pop band Aasma. The game begins with 20 SSR being handed over to each of the three contestants, with right answers getting them 5 SSR and wrong answers setting them back by 5 SSR. 

 At the end of it all, the contestant with the most SSR gets the chance to go shopping through eight levels of items. Super Sale starts August 15, Monday to Friday at 7.30 pm.

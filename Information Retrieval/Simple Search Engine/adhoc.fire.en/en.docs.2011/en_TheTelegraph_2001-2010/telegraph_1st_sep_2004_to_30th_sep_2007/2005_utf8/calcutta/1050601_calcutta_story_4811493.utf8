 Boy missing for four days

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 A six-year-old boy is missing since May 27, raising fears that he may have been kidnapped to settle scores with his father, who owns a string of tailoring shops. 

 Sk Sajjan Hossain was last seen playing with his friends in the afternoon of May 27 in a park near his Malipara house, under Rabindra Nagar police station area, off Garden Reach, on the southern fringes of the city. Four days after he disappeared, Sajjan?s father Javir lodged a missing diary with police on Tuesday. 

 All the while, cops claimed, Javir was trying to negotiate on his own, taking calls from the abductors, who started off with a demand for Rs 25 lakh as ransom, and later scaled it down to Rs 4 lakh. 

 ?Even though the boy has been missing for a few days, we received the complaint only today. The district police superintendent has been asked to probe the incident after taking account of all factors, including that of the child?s father?s business,? said Harman Preet Singh, deputy inspector-general of police (Presidency range). 

 As on any other day, Sajjan, according to neighbours, had returned home from school with his mother in the morning. In the afternoon, he went out to play with his friends. 

 Since the park is close by, no one bothered to keep an eye on him. Towards the evening, when Sajjan didn?t return, his mother went out to look for him. When he could not be found, his father and his staff looked for the boy for three hours. Police are investigating the case.

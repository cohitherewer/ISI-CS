 Onus pinned on engineers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Officers of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) will no longer be able to get away by passing the buck on illegal construction, if we can take mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya?s word for it. 

 He will hold the assistant and sub-assistant engineers responsible for any unauthorised construction coming up in their respective areas.

 It will be the borough engineer?s duty to inform the civic headquarters about illegal construction in his locality. 

 The borough engineer will be showcaused if it is found that he had not informed the civic authorities in advance after receiving a complaint from local people. 

 Bhattacharya and his mayoral council member (building) Dipankar De have already held a meeting with director-general (building) Pranab Basu, city architects Soubrata Seal and Somnath Pal and executive engineers of the 15 boroughs and conveyed their decision to them.

 According to the CMC?s estimate, at least 300 minor and major illegal constructions are coming up in the city at any point of time. 

 ?By illegal construction, we don?t mean minor additions and alterations in an existing building. I don?t believe that a whole building, or an additional floor in a building, can be constructed illegally without the knowledge of an assistant or sub-assistant engineer of the locality,? Bhattacharya stressed.

 Civic building department engineers said illegal constructions thrive and flourish in slum and colony areas. New Alipore, Chetla, Topsia, Tiljala, Kasba, Picnic Garden, Chowbhaga, Behala, Jadavpur, Kidderpore, Garden Reach and Ekbalpore are spawning these structures.

 According to the civic assessment department, in the colony areas alone, more than 1.25 lakh unassessed flats have materialised. These enjoy all civic amenities without shelling out any property tax.

 Building department engineers held politicians, particularly local councillors, responsible for illegal constructions.

 ?I have my doubts about Bikashbabu ever succeeding in this endeavour of his. His own CPM leaders will rein him in if he goes too far,? said a former director-general (building).

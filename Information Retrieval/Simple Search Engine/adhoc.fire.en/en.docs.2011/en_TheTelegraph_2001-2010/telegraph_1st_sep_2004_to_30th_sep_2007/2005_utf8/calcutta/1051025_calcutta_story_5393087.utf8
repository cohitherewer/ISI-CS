Cooking it up with caution

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

Q: We are moving into a new duplex house 

where the kitchen is in the south-east corner of the first floor and the kids 

room on the floor above it. I would like to know the placement of the stove, sink 

and the colour it should be painted in. Also, is it fine to have the kids 

room above the kitchen?

Ambika Banerjee

THE SOLUTION: The ideal placement for the stove is 

in the east and the sink in the north of the kitchen. They should never be placed 

opposite each other as that causes clashes among family members. 

As fire and water are two primary, and at the same 

time clashing, elements in the kitchen, it is important to make them compatible 

and friendly by introducing wood element lavishly. This can be incorporated by 

painting the kitchen in tones of green and by decorating it with green plants, 

flowers, green jars, green serving trays and cane baskets. 

This element also helps to soften the environment 

that has lots of metal in the form of heavy utensils and cutlery. Do not keep 

knives exposed in the kitchen. It is best to store them hidden in drawers. 

It is extremely important to have good lighting under 

the overhead cabinets that will keep the counters well illuminated as this is 

the place where energy tends to stagnate. 

It is not advisable for the kids to occupy the 

room above the kitchen because this way they will be sleeping directly above fire. 

This might make them short-tempered and volatile. 

Wood worries

Q: I am going through a very bad phase in 

my life. I dont share a good rapport with my father. Of late I am having 

a lot of problems with my friends. I never get my due importance anywhere and 

always get overshadowed by people. My family is also going through a financial 

crisis. At work, my boss is not very impressed by me. I want to know what I can 

do to improve the situation. Also, what are my marriage prospects? My date of 

birth is 19.01.82.

Ekta 

THE SOLUTION: There is a clash between the rabbit 

and the rooster this year in your 10 yearly pillars. The elements that are in 

power are metal over wood and wood represents your mind. This means there will 

be unnecessary pressure on your mind this year. The best solution would be to 

surround yourself with shades of green to strengthen your mind and carry a picture 

of a dragon in your bag. 

Next year you will step out of this phase and enter 

one where you will get a promotion in your office and also get married. Place 

your photo with your father in the east of your bedroom to strengthen your relationship 

with him. 

Your problems with your friends will be sorted out 

by energising the north-west of your bedroom. Make a circular collage of your 

friends on a white background and give it a gold border. 

Write a note of affirmation in bold letters saying 

that you enjoy healthy relationship with all your friends and paste it on the 

top and visualise it really happening in your life.

Career course

Q: I am doing my masters in human rights 

and journalism simultaneously and want to know in which field I will be successful. 

On the personal front, I am very bad at handling relationships and end up losing 

my loved ones because of misunderstandings. Please advise. My date of birth is 

03.01.84 at 2.20 pm.

Debyani Bose

THE SOLUTION: You are a weak fire person and have 

five elements of water that signify a very high status for you in life. 

This status is definitely connected with journalism. 

Water element represents media and communication, and you should excel in this 

field. 

Strengthen your weak self fire with vibrant colours 

like red, maroon, purple, mauve, peach and pink colours. Supporting and nourishing 

elements of wood means you will do well in paper and printing related profession.

Q: I am a working woman living alone in 

a small house. It has very minimal furniture without even a single picture on 

the wall. At times I feel like buying a few paintings and artefacts, but somehow 

I am not attracted towards them. Does Feng Shui recommend having these in the 

surroundings? 

Smriti Ganeriwal

THE SOLUTION: The interiors of the house along with 

pictures, paintings and artefacts occupy an important place in Feng Shui. 

Bare walls are more likely to make the residents feel 

lonely or depressed because there is nothing to attract them back to the house. 

It is very difficult and depressing to live in a totally 

bare house. A well-decorated home on the other hand keeps the residents cheerful 

and happy. 

It is not a nice and welcoming feeling to enter a 

house where a blank wall confronts you. In contrast, the view of a beautiful painting 

on entering makes you feel happy and keeps you well focused. 

Moreover, these beautiful objects attract the inflowing 

cosmic energy and help it to anchor, which then happily circulates in the house.

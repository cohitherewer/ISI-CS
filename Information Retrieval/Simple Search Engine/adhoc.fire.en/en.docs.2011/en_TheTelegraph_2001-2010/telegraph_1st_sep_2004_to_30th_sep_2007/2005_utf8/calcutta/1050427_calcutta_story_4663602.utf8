 Strings of melody

 Continuing its endeavour in spreading the wealth of Indian culture and making it a part of our daily lives, Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre hosts an evening of veena recital by Geetha Krishnamurthy. Trained in classical instrumental music by her mentor, Dr. A. Chittababu, she has performed to great acclaim at concerts in India and abroad for nearly two decades. Krishnamurthy?s forte lies in her simplicity of style, which helps her generate an awe-inspiring musical ambience. This evening, she commences the presentation of her Raaga-thala, a selection of 10 classical pieces, with Saraseeruhasana priya-naata, composed by Puliyur Doraswami. Saraseeruha nayane - amruthavarshini, Kamalapthakula - brundavana saaranga, Annapurne visalakshi - saama, Jagadoddharana - kaapi and Dhanasri raga thllana are some of her other offerings.

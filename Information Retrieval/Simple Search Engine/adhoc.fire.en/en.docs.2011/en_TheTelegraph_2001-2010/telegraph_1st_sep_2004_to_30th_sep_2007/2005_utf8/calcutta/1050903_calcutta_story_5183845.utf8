 Poll shadow on panel

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The exercise to regulate the functioning of English-medium schools affiliated to the private boards has run out of steam with the government becoming reluctant to make a tough call on institutions failing to meet the minimum quality criteria.

 A 12-member committee has been entrusted with the responsibility of framing guidelines for the gradation of the ICSE and CBSE schools.

 The backtrack on the part of the government is apparently for the benefit of the students, many of whom would suffer if schools are closed down by the government.

 Sources close to the 12-member committee, however, maintained that the government strategy is prompted more by next year?s Assembly elections than by concern for the welfare of the students.

 The committee met for the second time on August 29. No work could be done during the meeting because the required documents could not be found.

 After making the other committee members wait for more than an hour, government officials in the panel told them that the keys to the cupboard where the documents were kept were not available. The sources described the loss of keys as ?intentional?.

 ?We were shocked at the manner we were made to sit idle through the meeting. How could the education department be so callous when the issue of fee hikes needs to be settled as early as possible,? asked a committee member. The panel will meet again on September 8. 

 The government had promised in the Assembly that the committee would complete its work in three months. It held its first meeting on August 10 this year.

 Ardhendu Sekhar Biswas, head of the panel and commissioner of school education committee, highlighted the problems the students might face if the schools are penalised by the government for irregularities.

 ?The government already has the power to withdraw the no-objection certificates granted to the ICSE and CBSE schools. But a stern action will only jeopardise the careers of innocent boys and girls. On an average, each school has a strength of about 1,500 students,? Biswas said.

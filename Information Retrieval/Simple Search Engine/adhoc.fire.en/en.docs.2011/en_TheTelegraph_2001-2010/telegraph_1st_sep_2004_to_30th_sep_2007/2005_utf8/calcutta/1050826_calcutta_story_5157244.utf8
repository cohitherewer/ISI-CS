 Torture cry over protest 

 - Outspoken cadre in hospital after night in jail

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A former CPM activist, who had been vocal against a nexus between the party members and promoters in the Kalabagan area, was allegedly tortured in custody by police on Wednesday night.

 Md. Bakhtiyar, 30, is now fighting for life in Medical College and Hospital. He is a resident of Madan Burman Street, in the Jorasanko police station area.

 Bakhtiyar?s friend Md. Sabir, a fruit vendor, said around 7 pm on Wednesday, some officers had asked them to visit the police station.

 ?On reaching the police station, we found an influential CPM leader of ward 39 sitting there. The officer-in-charge asked Bakhtiyar why was he protesting development of the Kalabagan area. The officer then tried to intimidate him. When Bakhtiyar remained unmoved, the cop threatened him with dire consequences,? Sabir alleged.

 He added: ?The leader asked the officer-in-charge to beat up Bakhtiyar, who was soon booked for attempt to murder and involvement in bombing during the civic elections.? 

 Bakhtiyar?s elder brother Md. Tamanna stated: ?My brother was actively associated with the CPM before the civic elections. After the polls, he dissociated himself from politics after a dispute with the local party leadership. He also started to speak out against the nexus between local promoters and CPM activists.? 

 Bakhtiyar was produced in Bankshal court around 2 pm on Thursday. He complained of chest pain in the court lock-up. He was helped to the courtroom, but then shifted to hospital on the instruction of the judge.

 Police rubbished the allegations of torture. ?Bakhtiyar has criminal records,? claimed Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner (central division). 

 Sabir alleged: ?When we reached the hospital, some officers of the police station told us not to make a hue and cry about the torture. They promised to let Bakhtiyar out on bail if we did as they said.?

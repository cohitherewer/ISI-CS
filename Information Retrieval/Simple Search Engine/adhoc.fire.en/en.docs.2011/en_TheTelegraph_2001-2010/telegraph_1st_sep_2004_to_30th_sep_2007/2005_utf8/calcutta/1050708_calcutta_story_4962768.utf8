 CM prop for JU cops

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 There were no police excesses on Jadavpur University students on the night of June 10, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said in the Assembly on Thursday, while replying to a call-attention motion.

 The government has come to the conclusion, he added, on the basis of the findings of an inquiry by the additional director-general of police (law and order).

 ?We are against deploying police for ending students? movements. But on June 10, the cops had to be sent in as the condition of some of the students on a fast-unto-death had deteriorated. There could have been a casualty if we had not broken the fast,? Bhattacharjee said.

 ?Students are free to organise movements, but we cannot allow them to take suicidal steps,? he stressed.

 Recalling the chain of events, the chief minister said the superintendent of MR Bangur Hospital had examined the fasting students around 10 pm on June 10 and recommended that they be shifted to hospital immediately.

 Thereafter, a team of officers from the South 24-Parganas police tried to persuade the students to follow the advice of the superintendent. 

 But the group turned down the plea, and soon, around 400 students gathered on the spot and prevented police from taking the protesters to hospital.

 Left with no alternative, the cops forced the striking students into an ambulance and drove them off to hospital.

 Bhattacharjee also clarified that police had not entered the campus, as the protesters were camping outside.

 The chief minister?s statement triggered resentment among the faculty of engineering and technology students? union (Fetsu) members, who reiterated that they had been victims of police excesses on the night of June 10.

 ?The statement is based on reports by officials, who had evidently lied to the chief minister. Police had beaten us mercilessly and a huge contingent had been camping on the campus since evening,? said a Fetsu leader.

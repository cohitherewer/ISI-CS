The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Knifed, yet not yielding

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Ignoring the repeated stabbings on his shoulder and legs by a robber, a businessman held on to his accomplice, who raided his sari shop on Muktaram Babu Street in the Jorasanko police station area, and handed him over to police on Wednesday evening. 

 Around 8 pm, the two brothers and partners, Vishal and Suresh Jalan, were attending to two customers. Two others employees were showing the saris, said a Jorasanko police station officer.

 A man in his late 20s entered the shop, pretending to be a rich customer. 

 He asked Vishal for a particular sari. ?The employees showed him a number of saris but he was not satisfied,? said the officer.

 After 15 minutes, another youth entered the shop and whipped out a revolver. The moment he went close to the cash counter, where Vishal was sitting, and demanded the cash, Vishal pounced on him, said an officer of the detective department?s dacoity wing.

 Vishal went across the cash counter and pinned down the goon on the floor. ?The other man, who had entered the shop posing as a customer, took out a knife from his trouser pocket and stabbed Vishal,? a police officer said. 

 ?He first stuck the knife into Vishal?s shoulder. When it didn?t work, he stabbed Vishal?s legs repeatedly,? he added.

 But Vishal?s grip did not loosen. ?Suresh and other employees raised an alarm. On hearing the ruckus, officers of Jorasanko thana patrolling the area in a jeep rushed to the spot and arrested the robber, whom Vishal did not let go. The other robber managed to escape,? said another officer of Jorasanko police station.

 After conducting preliminary investigations, police feel the robbers may have come from neighbouring states, such as Bihar and Jharkhand. 

 ?They were speaking colloquial Hindi. There are several cases in which gangs from the neighbouring states have been caught in the recent past,? said an official of the detective department.

Amber, without a hitch

 Amber with Hitch co-star Will Smith: New innings

She?s a supermodel, but that?s not a label Amber Valletta wants. After playing bimbos and dead bodies in Hollywood, the flame-haired beauty is all set to scorch the screen in her latest film, Hitch, with a meaty role.

 ?I think it?s pretty true of all men really, but maybe more so of American men,? said the Arizona-born actress when asked whether American men are not generally smooth. Why? Because ?men here are not groomed to be, uh, men as much?. Listen up boys, too much machismo, beer-drinking, TV-watching and sports do not necessarily make a man.

 The 31-year-old?s idea of a real man is a guy with intelligence, confidence, a protector in a non-physical way (not aggressive enough to start fights), honour, integrity and most importantly, humour. Above all, ?he doesn?t have to be, you know, a jerk?. 

 The mother of one has no illusions about American men. ?Some of the European men are more travelled and more cultured than, I think, some of the American guys and I think that is really, really charming for a woman ? a guy who can talk about books and films and art. And American guys aren?t as knowledgeable as Europeans are and maybe even Australians? In the rest of the world, the schooling is better. Our schooling in America is terrible. That makes a big difference.? 

 The face of fashion houses like Prada, Calvin Klein, Armani, Gucci, Versace and Chanel admits to being ?terrible? at the dating game, but wishes she had dated more in her 20s. Living the life of a high-flying fashion model and having no roots was a hampering factor. ?And now I think, gosh, I would really like to go out on dates. How fun would that be? I?ll make my husband take me out!?

 Her reticence helped her play the character of the millionairess in Hitch, who is being wooed by a chubby accountant, played by Kevin Smith (the small screen?s King of Queens). Ostensibly out of his league, he sets out to woo the love of his life, with some help from his boss, played by Will Smith, who offers New York men tips and tricks to win their women.

 Was it difficult to find dates, because some men are intimidated by attractive women with successful careers? ?I?m sure that plays into it, part of the reason why I wasn?t asked out. But I also think that women protect themselves a lot, because we are scared to be harassed or we?re scared to be used by a man. Women put up a lot of guards, so you don?t look available. So then a man won?t approach you,? said the model-turned-actress of her personal experiences. 

 ?I put a lot of work into the character, but I put a lot more work on the inner work of her, because you can do a lot to your outsides, but if the insides aren?t alive, you?re not going to believe the character.? 

 Apart from fitting into the role, the model since age 15 put in her own inputs into the look of the sexy millionairess. ?I was allowed to help with the clothing and the hair and make-up. We all talked and, you know, everybody put in their inputs and I would say ?I like this, I don?t like that.?? 

Amber Valletta: Getting real

While bringing out the inner character is important, so is the outward appearance, physically and symbolically. ?I think it?s in certain scenes you want a certain look to help send a message. Towards the end of the movie, the curly hair was really different from the rest of the film. Her outfit was different. There were reasons behind that. In the boardroom I, kind of, look like a little girl. That?s how she felt.?

 Amber might not be as big a fan of romantic comedy as she is of comedy, but the touch of reality in Hitch is what had her hooked. ?I think the love stories are endearing because they?re not typical. You get people who really are trying to fall in love for the right reasons. And it?s not this whole glossy image. You?ve got Kevin and I, who look so different but the hearts are what attract each other. And that?s really what life is about. It?s not the Hollywood polished, perfect thing.?

 A model is not how she wants to describe herself. It?s time to move on and do different things, feels Amber. ?I don?t really consider myself just a model anymore, because this last year all I did was acting. It was very interesting and I had a really great time doing fashion and I learned a lot and was given a great life and a great opportunity to see the world. But there?s only so many things that I can do in the industry? Now that I?m acting, I?ll still be doing it.?

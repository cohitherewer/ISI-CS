 Campus trio, joint degrees

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 A joint degree, by three universities, all 148 years old. Seems improbable, but will happen soon. 

 The universities of Calcutta, Madras and Mumbai ? as part of their 150th anniversary celebrations, to begin in 2006 ? have come together to offer joint courses and degrees in select undergraduate, postgraduate and doctoral courses. 

 The degrees will bear the logos of all three institutions, set up in 1857. 

 ?This is a unique move. We will be the first group of universities in the country to offer collaborative courses and award joint degrees,? Mumbai University vice-chancellor Vijay Khole said on Tuesday. The view was echoed by his Chennai counterpart S.P. Thyagarajan.

 They were in the city to finalise the memorandum of understanding, which will be signed shortly after the Calcutta University (CU) syndicate approves the proposal next week.

 To begin with, the joint degrees will be awarded at the doctoral level. ?We will examine the marketability of the doctoral courses and then launch similar courses at the postgraduate and undergraduate levels,? said CU vice-chancellor Ashis Kumar Banerjee.

 Once the system is in place, the syllabi of the joint courses will be prepared by all three universities. ?The courses will be run through interactions between the universities,? Banerjee said.

 The other proposed areas of collaboration include faculty exchange, library networking and organising cultural events.

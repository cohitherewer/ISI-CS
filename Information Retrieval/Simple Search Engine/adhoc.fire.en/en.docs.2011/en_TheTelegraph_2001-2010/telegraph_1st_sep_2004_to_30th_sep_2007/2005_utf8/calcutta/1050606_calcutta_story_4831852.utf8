The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 ... who?s the busiest of them all?

 Some believe in numbers, some in the names. Some have passed their prime, while others are just beginning to make a mark. 

 Metro takes a look at the films that will keep the Tollywood heroes and heroines going this summer

 Swastika, Prosenjit and Sayantani take a break on the sets of Nayak

 Four on the floors and six to hit the screen ? Prosenjit?s tally is unbeatable. But hot on his heels in popularity count is Jeet. Slowly inching close is strong contender Jisshu, while Sabyasachi Chakraborty and Tota Roy Chowdhury have carved a niche for themselves. But giving all the men a run for their money is Dada from Ooty.

 Though she?s constantly on the move, Rituparna Sengupta still manages to churn out the maximum number of films. But Rachana Banerjee is no less popular with the district cine-goers. Yet the one seemingly poised to nudge out both is Koel Mullick, not in terms of numbers but blockbusters. Raima Sen is content being just there, while the newcomers wait for the box office tests.

 Behind the bar

 A popular drink at theme bashes, punch is pleasing to the eye, easy to make and store as well. The word comes from the Hindi word Paanch, meaning five, and was conjured up when British soldiers set foot in India. 

 It originally comprised five basic elements ? sugar, a bitter aperitif, lime, beer and alcohol. But with time other ingredients were introduced to the drink, giving birth to various kinds of punches.

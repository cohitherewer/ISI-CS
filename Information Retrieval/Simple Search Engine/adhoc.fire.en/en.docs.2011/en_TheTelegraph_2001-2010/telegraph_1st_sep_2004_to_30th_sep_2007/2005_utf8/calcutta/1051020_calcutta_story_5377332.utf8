The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Rising to a new challenge

AAMIR KHAN opens up only when he has a project to discuss. 

His latest talking point: 

the six-in-one Toyota and the heart-warming Coca Cola ads. His listener: Pratim 

D. Gupta

 Images from the new Coca Cola commercial 

featuring Aamir Khan, and (below) Aamir in one of the brand promotions for Toyota 

He has been billed as anti-media ? by the media. Reason? 

He doesn?t wash his linen ? dirty or clean, depending on which camp you belong 

to ? in print or on satellite. But Aamir Khan has been consistent in his stand: 

?I only talk to the media when I have some project of mine to talk about.?

So, when you text-message him requesting a brief chat 

about his six-role blitzkrieg in the new Toyota Innova commercial on the small 

screen, you, at best, hope against hope that the little giant of the big screen 

might just respond. 

Hope dips as your mobile remains mute for half an 

hour. And then, it?s time for the rising.

Of hope that is, what with a ?private number calling? 

flashing on the the cell screen. A feeble ?Hello? is greeted with the trademark 

roll of the tongue: ?Hi, this is Aamir Khan. You had texted me.?

Well, yes! Okay. Right. Hang on. But, of course.

Breath back, the Q amp; A finally starts rolling.

We don?t get to see one Aamir Khan. And now there 

are six of them all over television?

(Laughs) When the agency head, Mr Gullu (Gullu 

Sen, chief creative officer, Dentsu India), came to me with the Toyota campaign, 

he had this entire script all worked out. And the script was one of the reasons 

that I agreed to the endorsement.

The advertisement wanted to exploit the versatility 

of the actor in me. So they wanted an actor who had done different kinds of roles 

in his career. What amazed me was the way Mr Gullu intertwined all my characters 

in the same situation.

What was it like, playing six of the characters 

you have lived at certain stages of your life?

It was this make-believe world where these six characters 

intersect with each other. There?s Bhuvan from Lagaan, Munna from Rangeela, 

Akash from Dil Chahta Hai, Siddharth from Ghulam and ACP Ajay Singh 

Rathod from Sarfarosh and my current look, which you will get to see in 

Rang De Basanti. 

It was extremely difficult for me since there was 

nobody in front of me. Usually, when you do a scene there?s someone with you and 

you react to the other actor. But here it was all in the mind, as I had to imagine 

how Akash or Munna would react to Siddharth Marathe. The whole ad was shot six 

times, with the six characters, one by one. It was very tricky, especially the 

facial expressions. Overall, it was a unique concept, which I found very challenging.

Your new Coca Cola commercial also is quite different 

from what you have done before?

That?s what I liked about it. It was very emotional. 

People expect another humorous ad from us. But when Prasoon (Joshi, national creative 

director of McCann Erickson) narrated this new idea, I could immediately see people 

connecting with it. The commercial touches the emotional chord in you.

How was your lecture session at Cambridge University?

It wasn?t a lecture really. I was one of the panellists 

in a discussion on cinema. It was more essential for academics and fellow technicians 

in the thick of film-making. It brought out a very different point of view, a 

very theoretical point of view towards cinema. Lots of sociologists were there, 

too. There were two topics in the session I was in. One was Kurosawa and the other 

was Indian cinema.

Have you pushed back the shooting dates of Kunal 

Kohli?s Fanaah to get back into shape?

(Laughs) I had a gap of around three to four 

months from the time I finished shooting for Rang De Basanti to the time 

I started shooting for Fanaah. So I decided to let go and get back to shape. 

Yes, I am on quite a strict diet at the moment.

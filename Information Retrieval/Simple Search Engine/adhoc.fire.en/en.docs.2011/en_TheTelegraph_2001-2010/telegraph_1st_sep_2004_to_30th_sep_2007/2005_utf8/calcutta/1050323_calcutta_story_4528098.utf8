The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 What?s the big idea?

 The Business Baazigar judges grilling the contestants

 If you are thinking of starting a business, forget a bank. Ignore the financial institutions. Knock on the doors of Zee TV. If the channel likes your idea, it might provide the financial backing. 

 The channel has come up with a reality show which issues an open invitation to bring innovative ideas and get rewarded for them ? ?Ideas lao, paise le jao?. It even goes a step further. The show does not end with the prize distribution. The winning idea is to be taken forward in the form of an actual enterprise, replete with risks and with an eye on the bottomline. 

 ?Business Baazigar is a brainchild of our chairman Subhas Chandra. Many people have the ideas but not everyone gets the opportunity. We are providing a platform for plans that are unique, viable and capable of leading somewhere,? says Abhijit Saxena, president, Zee TV, on a tour of Calcutta. 

 The show was conceived in September, soon after which ideas were solicited on beam. Thousands of entries poured in, including about 15,000 from Bengal. ?They ranged from the humble to the outrageous. One wanted to institutionalise the kabadiwala trade. Another wanted to start a lightning fast transport system,? he smiles. The people who have written in ranged from students to housewives to retired personnel to professionals? 

 A panel of judges sieved the ideas and met the budding entrepreneurs. The 50 who made the grade were flown to Mumbai. 

 The execution takes the contestants outside the studio. ?They will be put to numerous tests. Say we give one of them Rs 10 and ask him to travel from Calcutta to Jamshedpur. Some will try to increase the amount before starting off while others will look for cheap ways of travel. Some may make it but someone else may do so faster and with Rs 500 in the pocket.? 

 There will be no shortcuts as the contestants are staying as the channel?s guests. The camera will be following them all along. ?As eliminations happen in every round, people become desperate and forget the camera. We have had a girl who tried fraudulent methods to make a person lend her money. She was asked to leave the show.? Neither can people get friends to lend them money on the sly as they are grilled on how they earned every rupee. ?This way we want to see their skills of survival, how quickly they can adapt to changing circumstances and their capacity for coming up with innovative solutions.? 

 The winning idea will be backed by Zee TV, which has tied up with a venture capitalist for finances. The judges will be Chandra himself, Mahesh Murthy, CEO, Passionfunds, and a guest with a background in management, law or accountancy. 

 Once the year?s Business Baazigar is chosen, the channel follows him closely as he embarks on his business. ?The next season of the show starts with how he is doing.?

 Agreeing that the venture is replete with risks, Saxena points out that Indians love rags to riches stories. So how much is the channel investing? ?Mark my words, this is the most expensive reality show in India yet,? is what Zee has to say till the April launch.

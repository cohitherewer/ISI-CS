 Atanu Chatterjee: Bright record to bleak future

 As a child, Atanu Chatterjee would take time out from gully cricket to study. He wanted to become a doctor or an engineer, and knew hard work was essential. But now that his labour has reaped just rewards, all the teenager can do is turn his back on a bright future.

 Atanu has done well in Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) 2005, getting through to both the medical and engineering streams. But there is little to rejoice. The son of a retired group-D staff cannot pursue further studies for lack of finances. ?My father can no longer support my education. My days of studying with borrowed books are over and now I have to support my family. I have to look for a job in my father?s office,? sighs the boy from Bally, in Howrah.

 He has ranked 163 in the medical entrance exam and can choose to study in top medical colleges like NRS Medical College and Hospital, RG Kar and Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital, when the counselling for general category students gets underway. 

 Atanu, who had never taken tuitions for mathematics, also decided to try his luck in the engineering entrance exam. A rank of 314 means he can study either at Bengal Science and Engineering University, Shibpur, or information technology or electronics at Jadavpur University.

 ?We never expected my son to do so well. He was always a good student, but this is excellent. He was very casual when he took the engineering exam,? says father Sujajyoti. Left with no alternative, the proud father decided to take a bank loan, but was told he did not qualify. 

 ?It?s sad. We wish we could have done something for Atanu. He has always been a bright student,? says tutor Amiya Maiti, who runs the AK Maiti Educational Foundation in Entally, from where Atanu took help for his JEE preparations. 

 But his success is the cause of Atanu?s unhappiness, taunting him with dreams he can?t turn into reality. ?What will you do by becoming a doctor? Take up some odd job and support your father,? was the latest advice from a relative. 

 ?Sometimes I think they?re right. Why did I take the exams in the first place? And why did I get good results?? he laments.

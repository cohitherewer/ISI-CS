 Eat mutton to heart?s content

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A mouth-watering piece of news for those who love mutton, but are forced to shun it because of its high fat and cholesterol content, which often leads to cardiac and other ailments.

 A team of scientists from Jadavpur University?s food technology department claims to have developed a formula to reduce the fat and cholesterol content in mutton by at least 70 per cent.

 ?After much research, we have developed the fat-reducing process. It is very simple and requires ingredients that are cheap and easily available,? said Utpal Roychowdhury, head of the university?s food technology department.

 Elaborating on the procedure, he said: ?Make a mixture of cold tea liquor and honey, and dip the mutton pieces into it. After around 30 minutes, take the pieces out and treat them with garlic paste and honey. Wait for 15 minutes and you have ready-to-cook mutton without the harmful fat or cholesterol.?

 Fat content in mutton is pegged at 40 per cent, against 25 per cent in chicken. Given the scientists? claim that their formula can reduce the fat content even by 90 per cent, mutton treated through the process could be healthier than chicken.

 And not just fat or cholesterol, the process can even rid mutton of bacteria. 

 ?We have found several other reagents by which the fat content can be reduced, but they are very costly and not easy available. Besides, it is not advisable to add strong chemicals to food items. So, we have developed the process with desi ingredients,? Roychowdhury said.

 The University of Chicago and scientists from the USA, the UK and Germany have approved the process, he claimed. The research paper will be published next month in the journal of Food Science and Technology International, USA.

 The university is also exploring ways to put the invention to commercial use, by involving unemployed youths and industrialists. ?Anybody can process the meat using the formula at home. But certain expertise will be required to prepare the reagent. We have already applied for a patent and expect to get it soon,?? Roychowdhury told Metro. 

 A workshop with unemployed youths will be held in the first week of March. The youths will be encouraged to set up units to produce the reagent. 

 The university will provide the technology and also assist the youths to market the products.

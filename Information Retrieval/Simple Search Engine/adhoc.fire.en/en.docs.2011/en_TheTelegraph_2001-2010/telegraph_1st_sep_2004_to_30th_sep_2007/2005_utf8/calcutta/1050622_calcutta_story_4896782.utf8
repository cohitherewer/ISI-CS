 Chiselled insights

 With a spontaneous understanding of the nuances of visual language, Sujit Kumar Karan is one of the few sculptors of our time to have ventured successfully into the various mediums of sculpture. The ongoing exhibition of his works bears testimony to the variety of his creative repertoire. Besides bronze and stone, he has recently crafted some terracotta pieces (Mother and child; picture above) in collaboration with traditional potters. Innovative in design and contemporary in style and substance, his creations sometimes find the artist attempting to bridge the gap between the traditional and the modern. An evocative, formal approach, distinguished by a deliberate avoidance of extraneous, stylistic devices, marks him out as an artist trying to reach out to a large cross-section. Mainly depicting forms and objects from nature and the world around us, Karan breathes fresh life and energy into a form of art often conceived as abstruse and belonging to the exclusive domain of the elite.

 Event: An exhibition of sculptures by Sujit Kumar Karan

 When: Till today, 3 pm - 8 pm

 Where: Academy of Fine Arts, North Gallery

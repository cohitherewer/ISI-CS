The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Health, waste pitch in policy shift

 JAYANTA BASU

 With eyes firmly set on next year?s Assembly elections, the Left Front government has decided to bring about major policy reforms in the urban sector, with environment and health being identified as the key areas of concern.

 As a first step in implementing the policy initiative, urban development and municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya and environment minister Manab Mukherjee on Wednesday launched the State Solid Waste Mission.

 ?Apart from the mission, we are also working on an urban health policy and an urban drinking water policy,? Bhattacharya told Metro.

 ?The policies are in various stages of preparation and once ready, we will place them before the Cabinet,? he added. 

 After they are approved, the government will approach the Centre, as well as international agencies, for funds.

 The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority has been identified as the primary implementing agency for the solid waste mission.

 ?Solid waste management has been a major problem for the municipalities and even the Supreme Court has stepped in on the issue. That?s why we have launched the solid waste mission,? said an urban development department official. 

 A committee has been formed under the chairmanship of the chief secretary to finetune the policy initiatives. Representatives of various stakeholders, including some government departments, are on the panel.

 ?Though we expect financial assistance from various sources, funds are not everything. We have seen how some low-cost initiatives on waste management have become successful because of proper planning and people?s participation,? said a municipal affairs department official. ?Kanchrapara and Kalyani are models worth emulating.?

 As for health, the other key area of concern for the government in urban centres, the officials are collecting inputs from experts for a health policy, in which immunisation, couple protection, infant mortality and lifestyle diseases will be given special emphasis.

 A month ago, the government, with help from Unicef, had launched Urban Health Initiative. Rudolf Schwenk, Unicef?s representative in the state, said the initiative was aimed at ?ensuring that all children in the urban areas are fully protected against polio, as well as the other vaccine-preventable diseases?.

 Signing off, minister Bhattacharya said: ?Technology and people?s participation will be given equal importance in the formulation of policies and their implementation.?

Little India: exclusive line

ZONE

If Forum has been the biggest factor for the emergence 

of Elgin Road as the city?s new shopping hub, there are many other relatively 

smaller addresses on that stretch that have further fuelled the frenzy. And the 

one that tops the list of these fashion stops is Little India ? the multi-label 

studio housing designerwear from all over the country.

The 2,500-sq-ft studio at 7A Elgin Road is home to 

some of the finest pret and couture labels of India, including big names like 

Rohit Bal, Rajesh Pratap Singh and Raghavendra Rathore.

?The interest in designer labels is rising very fast 

among Calcuttans. A multi-brand outlet like Little India caters to people of diverse 

tastes and varied budgets,? says director Krishna Raja. 

Label line-up

From the very outset, the studio has been offering 

ensembles by Rohit Bal, Rajesh Pratap Singh, Raghavendra Rathore, Anuradha Vakil 

and Priyadarshini Rao.

Bal?s Balance label presents a wide range of cotton 

and linen shirts for men and salwar kameez, churidars and kurtis 

for women.

Rathore?s royal range of clothing includes long kurtas 

and intricately-embroidered fusion silhouettes. Vakil?s salwar suits in 

Maheshwaris, pure silks and cotton silks, and Rao?s asymmetrical skirts and tops 

in fruity shades are high on the wearability ladder. 

New names

The store added a few new labels to its racks during 

the Pujas last October. K2 by Krishna Mehta, Le Spice by Suneet Verma, AND by 

Anita Dongree and a line by Wendell Rodricks were the additions in the pret segment.

Collections by Zooni from Mumbai and Calcutta-based 

designers Sayon Mitra and Abhishek Dutta were the other valuable additions to 

the store. 

Young talent

The store also provides a platform for young and upcoming 

designers, whose creations share rack space with the bigwigs. 

These include works by designers Natasha, Neha Jain, 

Suchismita Dasgupta and Priyanjali Ray.

A wide array of ethnic wear including salwar suits, 

saris, kurtis and lehngas, and western garments like ponchos, skirts 

and tops by these designers throws up stylish picks with relatively low price 

tags.

Just gem 

A line of jewellery by designer Eina Ahluwalia provides 

options to accessorise the outfits.

Her label Breathing Space offers ornaments in pearls 

and semi-precious stones, in chunky tribal as well as sleek modern designs. A 

recent addition is a range of costume jewellery by Priyanka Punjabi. 

Accessorise it

Designer bags and shoes complete the fashion story 

here. While Priyanka Khosla offers a range of embroidered party bags, designer 

Sarika has launched a line of Jaipuri cloth totes. A collection of embellished 

chappals, also by Khosla, can be teamed with the bags. The men can pamper 

themselves with regal leather shoes by Rajesh Pratap Singh.

 Cabbie turns killer after licence loss

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A taxi driver goes berserk on discovering his driving licence and a few hundred rupees missing from his pocket. He picks a fight with two youths he suspects and beats them up with a bamboo stick, leaving one of them dead. 

 The incident occurred on Narkeldanga Main Road early on Friday. The driver, Shravan Yadav, has been arrested.

 According to police, a number of local residents witnessed the two youths being beaten up by Yadav, but none came forward to their rescue. 

 ?The way he was beating up the two suggested that he had gone mad. The residents did not dare resist him,? said an officer of Phoolbagan police station.

 Yadav, who sleeps on the pavement, woke up around 5.30 am and found his licence and the money missing from the pocket of his shirt. 

 ?He had taken off his shirt before retiring for the night and kept it beside him. After discovering what he thought to be a theft, Yadav went to Babu Biswas, who ran a roadside tea-stall. Biswas was a resident of Duttabad, Salt Lake,? Jawed Shamim, deputy commissioner of police (eastern suburban division). 

 As Biswas, too, slept on the same pavement the previous night, Yadav suspected he had stolen the licence and the money. 

 ?He came in front of the stall and asked Biswas about the missing items. Biswas denied any knowledge of them,? Shamim added.

 But Yadav did not believe what Biswas said, and, instead, accused him of stealing the money and the licence. 

 ?Soon, an altercation broke out between the two,? said another officer of Phoolbagan police station.

 Yadav suddenly turned violent. He ran to a nearby playground and picked up a bamboo stick. Several bamboo poles were dumped on the ground, where a religious meeting is scheduled to be held on Sunday.

 Yadav ran back to the stall and started beating up Biswas with the stick.

 Hearing his screams, Biswas?s friend Rakesh Ghosh came to his rescue. ?Yadav immediately turned to Rakesh and hit him with the stick. Rakesh slumped to the road and passed out,? said the officer. ?Yadav continued his assault on Biswas, even after he fell unconscious.? 

 Seeing blood oozing from Biswas?s mouth and nose, Yadav fled. 

 This time, however, the residents gave him a chase and pinned him down. 

 Another group took Biswas to NRS Medical College and Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

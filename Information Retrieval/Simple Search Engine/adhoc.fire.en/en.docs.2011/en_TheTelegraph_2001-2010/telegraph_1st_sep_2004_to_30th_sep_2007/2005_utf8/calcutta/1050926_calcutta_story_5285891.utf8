 You share your birthday with...

 Serena Williams 

Your magnetism is hard to resist. Daring and inquisitive, you come up with the right answer at the right time. Others see you as a cool person. You are very understanding and don?t expect everyone to live up to your expectations. You dislike emotional outbursts. You have a realistic, respectful rapport with co-workers, considering everyone a source of inspiration rather than a competitor. ? Kusum Bhandari

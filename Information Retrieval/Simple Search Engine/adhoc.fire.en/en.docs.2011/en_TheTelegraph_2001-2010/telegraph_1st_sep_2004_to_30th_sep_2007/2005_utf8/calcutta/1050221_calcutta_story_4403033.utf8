 Salt Lake frown on pavement gardens 

 SANJAY MANDAL 

 The civic authorities in Salt Lake have a new problem on hand: the tendency of a section of residents to beautify their premises by gardens.

 A large number of house-owners have been charged with encroaching on part of the footpath or the road in front and converting them into gardens. Flooded with complaints, the authorities are planning action against the ?encroachers?.

 ?We have been receiving complaints and will soon launch a drive to demolish the unauthorised constructions and boundaries guarding the gardens,? said Dilip Gupta, chairman of Bidhannagar Municipality. 

 ?There are a few such boundaries on footpaths of main thoroughfares, but the problem is much more serious in the blocks,? he added.

 According to civic officials, the gardens with boundaries of grille and bamboo-fencing are the main cause of concern. 

 ?We have demolished a number of such unauthorised constructions, but most of them are back in place,? said an official. ?The residents have to understand that what they are doing is illegal.? 

 ?Senior citizens and morning-walkers are among those who bear the brunt of the problem,? said Ajit Chatterjee, secretary of the Salt Lake Senior Citizens Association. 

 ?It is unsafe to walk on the roads and one can hardly use the sidewalk because of the encroachments,? he pointed out.

 A council, comprising six organisations of senior citizens of Salt Lake, will submit a memorandum to chairman Gupta, urging him to take steps against the errant house-owners. 

 There are allegations of footpaths being encroached upon for other purposes, too. ?Often, a part of a sidewalk is used as parking space for two-wheelers,? said Sabyasachi Dutta, Trinamul Congress councillor from ward 10. 

 The Bidhannagar Welfare Association, however, feels that the residents are being forced to raise the gardens. 

 Admitting that the gardens are posing problems, Ramen Das, vice-president of the organisation, said: ?They deter people from dumping garbage and committing nuisance in front of the houses.?

 He claimed that only a few gardens have encroached the sidewalks. Most of the gardens, he said, are in the blocks where footpaths have not been constructed.

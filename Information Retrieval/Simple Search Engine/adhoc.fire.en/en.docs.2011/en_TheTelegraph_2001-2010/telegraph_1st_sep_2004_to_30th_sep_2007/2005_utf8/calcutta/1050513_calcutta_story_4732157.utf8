The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Relay fast, exam boycott

 - Two-pronged protest paralyses varsity campus

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Seven members of the faculty of engineering and technology students? union (Fetsu) at Jadavpur University started an indefinite relay hunger strike on Thursday.

 Others who came to the campus in support of the strike, called to protest the suspension of five senior students, stayed away from the semester examinations.

 ?The first group of students started the relay hunger strike at 11 am. Before that, we met the registrar and handed him a letter informing him about our move,? said Amit Chakraborty, general secretary, Fetsu. The registrar did not react to the move, the student union leader said.

 ?The third-year students had exams today, but no one appeared for them either on the main campus or in Salt Lake,? he added.

 The engineering and technology faculty classrooms remained empty as the students braved the heat and staged a sit-in through the day.

 Many students also planned to stay on campus through the night in support of the seven fasting protesters. A fresh group is to take over the fast at 11 am on Friday, Chakraborty said.

 Students from the arts faculty have expressed their sympathies as have members of the science faculty students? union, according to Fetsu.

 ?We wanted to show the authorities that the entire student community stands united in this agitation,? Chakraborty said.

 Meanwhile, Arnab Roychoudhury, the final-year student of civil engineering who was suspended for his involvement in the September 2003 agitation, spoke out about submitting his confession in writing to the varsity authorities.

 ?I had written to the vice-chancellor exactly a week ago requesting him to consider my case with sympathy,? Arnab told Metro. He apologised for his role in the protest in which a university official was manhandled on campus by a mob of students. ?I clearly stated in my letter that my mother is very ill and this furore at the university is affecting her health,? he said.

 The crisis at home means the student is banking on a job he has secured through campus recruitment. ?I cannot afford to lose a year and miss this opportunity,? said Arnab.

 He and the other four students are awaiting official notification about their suspension, but the authorities have told Arnab that he would be permitted to sit for the supplementary test scheduled two months later.

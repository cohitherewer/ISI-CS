 Overnight bank rob bid by errand boy

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Employees of a bank in Howrah, opening up for the day, were taken aback on Friday morning when they found a man loitering inside.

 Middle-aged Lakshmi Naskar, who would run errands for employees of Gramin Bank in Sankrail, had managed to sneak into the bank the night before. He had even fortified himself with food for the night-long operation of clearing out the bank?s strong room.

 However, Naskar failed to break into the strong room safe and could only manage to break a lock. He was arrested and taken to Sankrail police station for interrogation during the day. 

 ?We have to find out how he entered the bank and whether someone else was helping him or not,? said Basab Dasgupta, additional superintendent of police (rural), Howrah.

 On Friday, the security guard and a few employees of the bank were astounded to find Naskar in the bank. 

 ?He seemed to have given up hope about breaking into the bank?s strong room and did not make any attempt to escape,? said an employee. An iron bar used to break one of the locks was recovered from a corner of the premises. Naskar had probably thought that a crowbar would be good enough to break all the locks, the employees added .

 Naskar, however, kept his silence. Around 10 am, the police were summoned by the bank manager and soon, Naskar was whisked away to the police station. 

 He left behind an empty tiffin box, the food inside apparently eaten by him a few hours earlier. ?When he failed to rob the bank, he tried to escape but failed, as the main door was secure and there was no other way out,? said a senior officer.

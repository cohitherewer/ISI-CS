 Kalyan Mukhopadhyay: Kosovo?s keeper of the peace

 Meet Kalyan Mukhopadhyay, 38, a West Bengal Police Service officer of the 1995 batch.

 Once a deputy superintendent of police in Purulia, where he was sent to crack down on Naxalites, he now deals with crimes in violence-scarred Kosovo ? from dacoity to murder to rape.

 Kosovo, torn apart by ethnic strife, has been under UN rule since the Serbian forces were forced to withdraw in the end-1990s. Mukhopadhyay is the only Asian representative in the 13-member Regional Crime Squad (RCS), based in Kosovo?s Pristina.

 In the city on a week-long leave, Mukhopadhyay recalled his experience of dealing with the law and order of what was once the most troubled spot in the world. ?The situation is volatile. The violence has subsided, but the province, with its demographic mix of 85 per cent Albanians and 15 per cent Serbians, is still sitting on a powder keg,? he told Metro. 

 Even a simple dacoity can spark a riot. ?There is practically no civil administration in Kosovo, which is run by police and para-military forces controlled by the UN,? he said.

 Mukhopadhyay went to Kosovo as a member of the UN mission in September last year. Initially, he was a patrolling officer in Mitrovica, the northern-most town of Kosovo. He was then guided by Bharati Ghosh, who was the station commander of Kosovo Polje.

 Competing with officers from 47 countries, Mukhopadhyay soon made it to the RCS, whose writ runs through nine police stations in the province. The squad members have around 40 Kosovo Police Service officers under their command. 

 ?If a crime is committed, we have to probe whether it has any link with the ethnic conflict. If such a link is established, our next task is to ensure that it does not snowball into a riot between the Serbs and the Albanians,? Mukhopadhyay said.

 ?We have to be extremely cautious if a serious crime, such as murder, takes place in a mixed zone, where both Serbs and Albanians have a significant presence,? he added. In such situations, UN military service K4 comes to their help. 

 The risk of working in Kosovo as a law-enforcer can be gauged from this anecdote. Once, in the middle of night, Mukhopadhyay received a call from one of his fellow officers that he was in trouble. 

 The officer was having dinner with a Serbian interpreter at an eatery in an Albanian-dominated neighbourhood. ?When we rushed to the spot, we found they were surrounded by a group of men who were staring threateningly at the duo. If we did not rescue them in time, they would probably have been lynched,? Mukhopadhyay recalled.

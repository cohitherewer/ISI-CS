 Schools in line of fire

 - Vulnerable private institutes risk losing certificate 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 English-medium schools in Calcutta and the rest of Bengal need to ensure they have proper fire safety arrangements in their institutions. 

 The state government plans to withdraw no-objection certificates (NOC) from a few dozen English-medium schools identified by it as vulnerable to fires during a study organised by it after the Kumbakonam tragedy last year. 

 Education department officers said the move to withdraw NOCs was being taken because many of the private institutions lacking fire safety devices are reportedly doing nothing to rectify matters. 

 The NOCs are given to private schools to seek affiliation from boards like the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) and the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE).

 ?English-medium schools have been set up in every locality. We may have to withdraw the NOCs if the schools fail to take proper fire-fighting measures,? an officer in the education department said.

 Citing examples in the government findings of how schools are exposed to fire hazards, education department officers said a CISCE school on Ripon Street has only one staircase, though it has an enrolment of more than 1,500 students. A school on Free School Street and another near Park Street have very narrow staircases. 

 According to fire safety rules, staircases in schools must be a minimum of eight metre wide. But in many schools, these are only three feet wide. A CISCE school in the Dum Dum area is housed in a building that shares a boundary wall with a petrol station.

 Some schools are located in narrow lanes. ?These schools need to be more cautious about their fire-safety arrangements, because one cannot rule out a stampede in case of a fire. We may ask them to relocate themselves if they do not adopt the required fire-safety measures,? asserted Kanti Biswas, state school education minister.

 And, waking up to the state government?s ultimatum, the CISCE, which has Calcutta?s largest number of English-medium schools ? 100-plus in the Calcutta Municipal area alone ? will bring to book institutions violating fire-safety rules laid down in the council?s safety manual in 2002.

 ?Many schools in Calcutta are like tinder boxes. They are death traps,? said Ismail Nehal, senior teacher of St James School and president, Association of Teachers of Anglo-Indian Schools.

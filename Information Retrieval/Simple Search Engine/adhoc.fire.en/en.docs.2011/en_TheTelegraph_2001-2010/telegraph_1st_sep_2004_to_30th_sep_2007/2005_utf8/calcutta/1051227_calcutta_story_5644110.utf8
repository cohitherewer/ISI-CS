 Young or old, cookies have been favourites with all ages. And for Calcuttans, theres now a brand new sort they can munch on ? freshly-baked Australian cookies called Cookie Man.

 We stress on quality. The goodies are an assortment of authentic Australian varieties. We use no preservatives and our ovens and ingredients, like the chocolate chips, are imported, says Anshuman Agarwal from Cookie Man.

 After Bangalore, Chennai, Mumbai, Noida and Gurgaon, City Centre in Calcutta is the newest destination for Cookie Man.

 And it is not just another shop but a huge bright yellow trolley with a makeshift place for accounts, storage and displaying the delights. But whatever the place or wherever they sell from, the focus essentially is: Be it six or 60, the idea is to cater to all.

 Brandy Snap, Choco Chip, Coffee Walnut?there are 15 varieties in all. From paper boxes to plastic holders to packs of two, the packaging is quite interesting. The family barrels and party barrels are all about an assortment of cookies. The tin ones with messages for special occasions serve as perfect gift options.

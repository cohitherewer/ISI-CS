 The etiquette of wine drinking and serving was the topic of discussion at an interactive session with some prominent ladies of Calcutta at the ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton amp; Towers on Tuesday afternoon.

 Hosted by Sopexa, the food and beverage marketing and promotion board of France, the session had wine expert Poh Tiong Chng educating the select audience on the various nuances of wine drinking at the West View Bar and Grill.

 The likes of Anju Talwar, Jan Subramaniam, Manju Mazumdar, Rita Bhimani, Payel Nath and Pratiti Sarkar, along with hotel general manager Ranvir Bhandari, attended the workshop.

 In town just for the session, Chng started off by demonstrating how one can open a bottle of champagne without a pop and the fizz. She moved on to uncork bottles of white and red wine from different regions of France, using different techniques for each.

 It is very important that you match the right wine with the right food. Ideally, white wine goes best with vegetarian food and red wine with meat. This kind of knowledge makes you a good host, said Chng, as the ladies busied themselves in sipping the wine on offer ? the right way.

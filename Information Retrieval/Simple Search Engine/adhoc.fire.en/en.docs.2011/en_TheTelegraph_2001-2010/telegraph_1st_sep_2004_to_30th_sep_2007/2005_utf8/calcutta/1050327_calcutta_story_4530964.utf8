The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Computers amp; compassion!

Customer relationship management is the latest buzzword, 

but a relationship without a heart is hypocritical

SHILOO CHATTOPADHYAY

This 

was last week. The afternoon flight for Mumbai left Calcutta on time. Despite 

strong head winds, the arrival at Santa Cruz was also on schedule. Many cups of 

coffee later, I was sitting in my hotel room with a few colleagues. We were all 

reviewing a presentation that had to be made the next day. Our concentration was 

intense, our attention undivided on the slides on view.

The message alert from my mobile caused more irritation 

than anticipation. I had already been welcomed by all the mobile companies in 

Mumbai. Who could it be? Was it one of those ?you forgot to take your toothbrush? 

messages from home or was it office reminding me to call back for an urgent consultation?

It was impossible to ignore or postpone, especially 

because the alert tone was intermittent but persistent. I picked up the mobile. 

The message was not from any of the expected sources.

My favourite airline was informing me that its flight 

left Calcutta at 1.54 pm and reached Mumbai at 4.29 pm. The message had reached 

me at 8.54 pm! That the message came four-and-a-half hours after touchdown was 

curious. More interesting was the fact that the message was being sent to a person 

who was on that flight.

Then there was this unfortunate accident. My car had 

to be sent for major repairs to the only authorised service centre of the automobile 

major in Calcutta. It took a good 10 days for the car to get back into shape.

On the sixth day, from the same authorised service 

centre, a sweet voice called me up. I thought she was calling about my car repair. 

I wanted to plead for a speedier repair service. I was really missing my car. 

When I picked up the phone, the voice at the other 

end courteously reminded me that my car is due for servicing. I asked her to peep 

through her window and tell the boss of the repairing section that.

Customer relationship management or CRM is the latest 

buzzword in marketing. Do not judge the importance of a customer by the rupee 

value of his last purchase, the doctrine recommends. Consider the lifetime value 

of a customer by the business he can give you over a long period of time. So retain 

him by building an intimate relationship with him. Address his peculiar needs. 

Service him with a smile. Let him know that you know that he likes his egg single 

fried and sunny side up.

Noble thoughts these. To do this to hundreds and thousands 

of customers is too much of a task to leave to the service team. They might end 

up serving hard-boiled eggs to the customer who loves a fluffy omelette. So technology 

is brought in to help systematise the customer-servicing requirement. The letters 

are automatically sent, numbers to be called flash on the screen, the mobile phones 

are automatically programmed to emit those update SMSs. Brilliant solutions to 

a difficult problem.

It is just that aberrations are tell-tale. A misplaced 

SMS or a stupid telephone reminder, like the ones I experienced, strips the veneer 

of the relationship management system. Ugly bare bones of technology become visible.

The moral of the story is very simple: an intimate 

relationship without a heart is hypocritical.

And please do not expect the brain of a computer to 

behave as its heart.

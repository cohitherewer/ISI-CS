 A historic blog

 Aamir Khan and Rani Mukherjee in Mangal Pandey: The Rising

 HI! I am in my space now and I am really enjoying reading what you guys have posted. To those of you who have been so appreciative of my work ? thanks for all the love and support. Much appreciated. I?m going to pick now at random some of the blogs and react to them individually. Mangal ho! (May all be well)?

 With two days to go for the mega release of Ketan Mehta?s Mangal Pandey ? The Rising, the man of the moment known as an introvert sits in front of his laptop to write to his fans on his personal blog.

 The blog, Me and My Space, has been specially created by MSN India for Aamir Khan to interact with his fans on the making of the film. Log in to www.msn.co.in/mangalpandey and the moustachioed Mangal is just a click away.

 ?We were approached by the producers of Mangal Pandey to promote the film as MSN accounts for 12.5 million users every month. As part of the promotions, we have created a blog for Aamir Khan where he is writing in his experiences during the making of the film. He is responding to around 10 mails a week,? said Krishna Prasad, head, programming, MSN. The portal has earlier promoted films like Parineeta and Kisna.

 MSN has also floated a Mangal Pandey lookalike contest where users can upload their pictures sporting Aamir?s moustache, hairdo, jacket and turban. ?The best-looking lookalike will attend the premiere of Mangal Pandey at INOX Mumbai on August 12,? added Prasad.

 An online quiz revolving around the character of Mangal Pandey is the third attraction. This has four multiple-choice questions and a clue. This apart, users can also check out and download movie and production stills and images of the music launch from the website. A separate section is dedicated to the film?s music, scored by A.R. Rahman. Set against the backdrop of the Sepoy Mutiny, Mangal Pandey chronicles a tale of love, betrayal and friendship co-starring Rani Mukherjee, Amisha Patel and Toby Stephens.

 And the last word from Aamir on the blog: ?You will be surprised how relevant History can. Wait and watch.?

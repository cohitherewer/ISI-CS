The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 VAT will scale down prices

C.M. BACHHAWAT, commissioner of commercial taxes, met readers of The Telegraph at his office on Thursday to answer their queries. 

Participants included Saileswar Chakrabarty, Kishan Tantia, Sujoy Sarkar, Bipin Ghosh, Kallol Dasgupta, S.S. Dey and Sandip Banerjee

Kallol Dasgupta: What is VAT and when is it going to be imposed?

 VAT is the acronym for value-added tax, which is a new form of commercial tax, to be imposed from April 1.

 Currently, a trader has to pay turnover tax, surcharge on sales tax and additional surcharge. With the introduction of VAT, all these taxes will be abolished. In addition, the central sales tax is going to be phased out, resulting in a fall in the prices of commodities.

 In the 1960s, VAT was introduced in Brazil and in some Asian countries. Such a system of taxation exists in China and Sri Lanka.

S.S. Dey: How can you justify the imposition of VAT?

 There are problems of double taxation and multiplicity of taxes in the present sales tax system. This results in a cascading burden on traders and consumers.

 For instance, raw materials and the finished product are both taxed under the present system. But VAT takes into account previous purchases as well as input taxes.

Sandip Banerjee: How will the introduction of VAT bring down the prices of commodities?

 It is not possible at this point to say precisely how the prices of commodities will decrease after the introduction of VAT. 

 But the traders and manufacturers would get input tax credit/rebate and the manufacturers would get a heavy rebate on the tax paid earlier, once the new system is in place. Therefore we can expect manufacturers or sellers to decrease the prices of their goods.

Kishan Tantia: We get rebates on taxes in cities like Delhi. Would tax rebates become a thing of the past once VAT is imposed?

 The basic concept of VAT has been carefully worked out by an Empowered Committee to put an immediate stop to the unhealthy tax-rate war and trade diversion among states. It has been observed that such a war has an adverse effect on many states. VAT will definitely help strike a balance in sales tax rates across the country.

Bipin Ghosh: What are the commodities on which VAT will be imposed?

 VAT will be imposed on 550 items. The rates will vary from 4 per cent to 12.5 per cent. There will also be a category of tax-exempted goods and a special VAT rate of 1 per cent on gold ornaments.

 Nearly 270 of the 550 items will be placed in the 4-per cent category. Liquor, lottery tickets, petrol, diesel, aviation turbine fuel and other motor spirits will be kept out of the purview of VAT as their prices are not fully determined by the market.

 A total of 46 commodities, which are exempt from taxation, will also remain out of the purview of VAT. Moreover, VAT will not be implemented on additional excise duty items like sugar, textile and tobacco for a year because of organisational hurdles.

Sujoy Sarkar: Do you have any printed publication on VAT or other commercial taxes?

 Our website www.wbcomtax.nic.in has all the required information. We also have a public relations wing in our Beleghata office.

Saileswar Chakrabarty: I work for a multinational bank. The bank has not deducted professional tax from my salary for the past decade. Do you have an audit system in place to assess such lapses?

 We have an assessment wing, but we do not ask for an audit report unless there is a gross discrepancy. However, if we receive complaints, we generally hold an inquiry and take legal action, if necessary.

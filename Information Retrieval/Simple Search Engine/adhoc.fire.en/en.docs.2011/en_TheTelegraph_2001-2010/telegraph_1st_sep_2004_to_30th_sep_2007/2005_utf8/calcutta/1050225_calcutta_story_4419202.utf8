 Dramatised choreography

 A dynamic medium of self-expression, the performing arts thrives under conditions of constant experimentation, evolution and change. Ranans production of Girish Karnads well-known play, Naga Mandala: The High Life, represents an innovative attempt to synthesise the language and rhetoric of classical dance with text-based drama in a way that explores the power of spoken words vis-?-vis the ornate, heavily stylised gestures and physical movements of dance. Set in an isolated, exclusive community, whose inhabitants live only for the sake of indulging their pleasures and fantasies, the play serves as a comment on the Epicurean way of life. Weaving together two Kannada folk tales within its plot, the performance simultaneously operates on several overlapping levels. Involving theatre actors, along with Kathak and Odissi dancers, it creates a verbal and visual drama that imbibes the structural nuances of each art form, at the same time allowing creative exchanges among the different styles, imparting to the presentation a unique artistic dimension. Concept and direction: Vikram Iyengar.

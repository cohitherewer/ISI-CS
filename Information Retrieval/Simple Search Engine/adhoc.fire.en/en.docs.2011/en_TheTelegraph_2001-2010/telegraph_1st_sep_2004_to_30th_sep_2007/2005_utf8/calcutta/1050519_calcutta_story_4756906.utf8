The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cop trio taken off the job 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 What began as a visit to a seriously-injured colleague in hospital ended with three policemen themselves committing a number of offences. 

 They used a police vehicle without authorisation, got drunk, and when the vehicle was involved in an accident, suppressed the fact for 24 hours.

 As the incident came to light, the three policemen of the traffic police department were suspended on Tuesday for tarnishing the image of the force. 

 ?The trio has been suspended on disciplinary grounds. They were found guilty of violating basic rules,? said Arun Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (traffic).

 An officer said the trio had gone to Calcutta Medical Research Institute hours before the death of Subrata Chowdhury, a constable of the south-east traffic guard who was seriously injured when a mini-truck knocked him down on St George?s Road last Saturday during an anti-pollution check. 

 Though all three were off duty, they went to the hospital in a traffic department jeep without telling anyone.

 ?After five minutes, they left the hospital and went straight to a bar in the New Market area. All three downed several pegs and left,? said the officer.

 Then, the vehicle hit a tree in Watgunge. ?All three were injured. One of them was bleeding profusely,? said another officer of the traffic department, adding: ?Straightaway, they took the jeep to a garage and asked its owner not to disclose that it belonged to the police.?

 Next, they went to a private hospital on Sarat Bose Road. ?On seeing three drunken men, the doctors refused to treat them. Then, they went to a heart research centre, to be refused again,? the officer said. 

 ?Both hospitals asked them to register a case with the police before coming for treatment. But they did not,? disclosed the officer.

 Next, they went to Calcutta Police Hospital. Again, they were advised to register a case first. So they went to a private health clinic and got themselves treated. One of them needed 12 stitches.

 Only after 24 hours did the office of the deputy commissioner (traffic) get to know about the incident on Tuesday. Initially, the trio was showcaused. When no plausible explanation was forthcoming, the deputy commissioner issued a suspension order. They were asked not to join duty till further orders.

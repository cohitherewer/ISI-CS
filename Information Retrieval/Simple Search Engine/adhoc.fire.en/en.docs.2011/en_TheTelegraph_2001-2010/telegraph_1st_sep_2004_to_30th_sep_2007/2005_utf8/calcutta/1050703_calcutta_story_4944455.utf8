 Stay home to play games

 Of the many games people play, 

 board games have endured through the ages, despite the onslaught 

 of the digital medium. And of these, there are certain classics 

 that have become global phenomena, refusing to go away, 

 entertaining generations of children and adults alike.

 As the monsoon sets in, it?s time to stock up on indoor diversions. Get a group together and get going. Metro on Sunday takes a look at the trivial pursuits that Calcutta seems to be most at home with.

 Monopoly: Fancy picking up prime property for a few hundred dollars? Not only has Monopoly survived over 70 years, the game invented during the Great Depression has not been touched by inflation! Considered the highest-selling board game in the world at over 250 million sets sold, Monopoly was officially launched in India in 1995. It has been a roaring success ever since, and in 2004, Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore and Chennai even held local rounds of the World Monopoly Championships, held every four years, just like the Olympics!

 Scrabble: This game too was born during the Depression, and would not have seen the light of day had its inventor not painstakingly created thousands of handcrafted sets. It went on to become the most popular word game of all time ? having sold over 120 million boards. And it?s not just for the brainy. Any fool can tell you that longer is not necessarily better when it comes to the Scrabble board. Cornering those triple word scores will get you much further, as will working in those rare letters. If you are looking for tips or some serious competition, contact a Scrabble club near you.

 Pictionary: Take a break from words with pre-verbal communication. You don?t have to be Leonardo Da Vinci to perfect the art of Pictionary ? caveman-style rudimentary drawings and stick figures will do just fine. This team game is much like Dumb Charades, without all the frenzied gesticulation and disastrous attempts at acting. Wannabe artists pick a card, get a word and have to draw it out, with their partners trying to beat the clock to guess what the doodle is supposed to stand for.

 Trivial Pursuit: Why watch a quiz show on TV when you could have a face-off of your own in the living room? If you aren?t feeling lucky enough to give KBC2 a try, this 23-year-old game could be the Big B?s biggest rival. Test your general knowledge with questions on literature and history, science and the natural world. Or go for a special Star Wars edition, if the force has you in thrall. Watch out, though, because some of the local editions do not pay the same attention to quality of questions as the international editions do. But it is still a treat, especially for quiz-crazy Calcuttans.

 Cluedo: If you want to play detective, this one?s for you. Reverend Green, Miss Scarlet, Professor Plum, Mrs Peacock roam about a murderous house of intrigue. Figure out the room, the weapon and the murderer by a process of elimination. Master the sleuthing technique without ever leaving home.

 Scotland Yard: This is 

 another option if you fancy joining the sleuthing squad 

 in earnest. In this challenge a wanted criminal is on the 

 loose in London. One player is the dastardly Mr X, who skulks 

 around the city leaving clues. The others are on the Scotland 

 Yard team and have to catch the crook to win. Or else, evil 

 prevails.

 Deep intense eyes, chiselled features 

 and a charming smile ? Milind Soman has the best of everything. 

 No wonder, girls drool and guys gape wherever he goes. And 

 on Friday, he was here in town.

 From being a swimming champ to a rage on the ramp, the career move for Milind was surprising but not unexpected. He was undoubtedly the first supermodel of the country, lending a face ? and what a body (!) ? to many a brand in the country.

 ?There were quite a few established names in modelling in the Eighties but somehow the media developed a liking for me. I enjoyed the success which modelling brought,? admitted Milind, now busy making modelling a career option for many an aspirant.

 After an illustrious career as a model, he switched to the small screen with his first serial, A Mouthful of Sky, in the mid-Nineties. The next step naturally was Bollywood. But this time he could not whip up the same magic. ?I gave up modelling in 1996 to concentrate fully on movies. But unfortunately the roles that came my way were very mediocre. I picked and chose the best roles,? recounted Milind.

 His role in 16 December brought him critical acclaim and Rules: Pyar Ka Superhit Formula made today?s teenagers flip for him. He then stunned critics with a nuanced performance in Arjun Sajnani?s Agnivarsha.

 The Made in India man seems to have hit a purple patch again. Some good projects, including his second home production, Phir Zindagi, are keeping him going on screen. His co-stars in this movie are Gul Panag and Waheeda Rahman.

 Add to that the relief over the court dropping charges against Madhu Sapre and him for the Tuff ad in the buff, about a decade ago. ?The acquittal has come as a major relief, but I could not fathom the hullabaloo over the ad campaign. It?s high time everybody forgot about the entire episode,? said the man behind the python.

 Things are also looking up on the personal front with love blooming with co-actor Mylene Jampanoi on the sets of Valley of Flowers. ?We have been seeing each other for a year now. I am enjoying being in a relationship. We hit it off instantly,? said Milind, flashing that smile.

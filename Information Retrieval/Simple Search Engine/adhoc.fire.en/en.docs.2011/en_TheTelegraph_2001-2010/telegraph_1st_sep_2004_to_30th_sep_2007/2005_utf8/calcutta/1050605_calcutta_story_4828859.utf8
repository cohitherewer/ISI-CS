 Mini mall within a mall

 Grab a bite at Hangout, watch a flick at INOX and run through the racks at Shopper?s Stop. If you thought you were through with City Centre, hold on tight to your shopping baskets.

 The second floor of the mall in Block A, which was an isolated corner in total contrast to the bustling mall, is all set to cater to customers who want to lay their hands on economically priced domestic items and clothes.

 The 10,000 sq ft area, situated just below the Royal Bengal Room, has been turned into a mini mall within the main mall. ?We had plans of the smaller mall within the main mall since the inception of City Centre. As a result, the provisions and area were kept aside for the smaller mall in the initial plan,? says Vineet Verma, CEO, City Centre. 

 The mini mall will officially be unveiled on Sunday, also the first birthday of City Centre. In one year, the Salt Lake address has emerged as a popular hangout and redefined how residents of the township shop for provisions or brands, how they eat out or go filmi. Yet, the conversion rate ? of footfalls into sales, of time spent into money spent ? has been a cause for concern.

 Is the mall within a mall a clever ploy to transform visitors into shoppers and set things right? ?Every mall takes some time to establish itself. We have crossed that period and contrary to general belief, the sales at the mall are phenomenal,? claims Verma.

 ?A mall within a mall is a brand new concept in the city,? he adds. ?People in Calcutta have come to associate the mall with lifestyle accessories and high-priced items. So we decided that shops in this area would stock economically-priced household items, gift items and garments.?

 It would also be an opportunity for the local and smaller entrepreneurs to display their merchandise in a mall that boasts of the Cartiers and the Armanis.The smaller mall, designed by Mumbai-based Kapil Bhalla, has 28 shops that have already been leased out. The shops would stock a wide range of ?economically-priced products? used on a daily basis in the household.

 For example, if you are out to make a killing with a shoestring budget, consider stepping into 66 to 99. This shop stocks most miscellaneous items on a shopper?s list, with a price tag varying between Rs 66 and Rs 99. 

 Then there?s a shop taken up by Sanlaap, an NGO, to stock ethnic saris sourced form various states of the country. 

 And women can spend quite some time at Ritwik, stocking daily-use appliances ranging from modular kitchen to crockery. Krishna Vatika would be selling accessories like gift trays and ribbons. There?s a good bargain in the bag for kid?s wears, ladies? western wear, gift items and leather accessories, too.

 ?The objective is to provide people with the ambience of a mall and merchandise that suits their pocket,? concludes Verma.

 Creator and the creations

 Nineteen thirty-eight. A giant sculpture of a naked woman has become the talking point at Santiniketan. The creator of the abode of peace comes across the creation and asks the smirking bystanders to send over the man who has given shape to it. They send the man, hoping that he would be admonished for his experiments with stone. Instead, Rabindranath Tagore advises him to carry on with his work and never look back.

 This turning point in the life of Ramkinkar Beij, illiterate son of the rural backwaters, inspired the title of Samaresh Basu?s biography of the great sculptor, Dekhi Nai Phire. The book in turn is inspiring a play on Ramkinkar?s life.

 Neel mati, lal kankor: Shilpi Ramkinkar, Atmar aloran premiered at Rabindra Sadan on Friday. ?People like Ramkinkar are thought to be too complex for comprehension. Their ideologies are thought to be obsolete in this world,? says director Kaushik Bandyopadhyay. ?On reading Dekhi Nai Phire, I was fascinated by the person who would work only for his own creative satisfaction, untouched by popular perception and criticism.?

 The book though is just a starting point for the play that follows Ramkinkar through his life?s journey, from his Jugipara home in Bankura, his shift to Santiniketan, his initiation into world art through his Kala Bhavan teacher Nandalal Basu, his tumultuous and unbridled personal life, right till the end. 

 Three actors bring alive Ramkinkar through the years ? Dipak Haldar, Anup Mallik and Ranoj Ray ? each having to pick up the local dialect of Bankura that the sculptor used to speak in.

 Artist Samir Aich is doing the sets for a stage production for the first time. ?I have taken a contemporary approach. You will not see a thatched hut or a tiled roof. There will be abstract designs on the background walls to catch his poverty and pain.? 

 As Santiniketan taught him western forms, there will be triangles and squares. The last scene also shows him passing through a series of life-size circles into oblivion. All around is a vibrant sunflower garden, reminiscent of his comparison with Vincent Van Gogh. Two of Ramkinkar?s sculptures will find rough replication on stage ? Dhanjharai and Koler Banshi. 

 ?There is no message that I am trying to get across. I know I cannot be like him. So through this production I am trying to touch his ideals, however briefly,? says the director. The second show takes place on Sunday.

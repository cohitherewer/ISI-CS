 Mayor veto for tax panel

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Salient features of the proposed tax reform:

 Five per cent extra rebate if a house-owner deposits the property tax for all four quarters within the rebate period of the first quarter

 No role for assessment inspectors in determining the tax of a building 

 A house-owner will get 30 days to lodge complaint against property valuation

 No complaint will be entertained if property tax remains outstanding 

 Property tax to be revised every three years 

 Parameters for determining the unit-area value of a building: location, type, use, structure, occupancy and status 

 Property tax not to be less than six per cent or more than 20 per cent of the annual valuation

 The owner of an unassessed building or a property tax-payer who has added or altered his premises may submit self-assessment return certified by a CMC-enlisted valuer 

 Suppression of facts will be a penal offence in case of self-assessment

 Municipal commissioner will be empowered to order suo motu assessment or reassessment 

Mayor Subrata Mukherjee is opposed to the composition of a proposed municipal valuation committee as it ?encroaches upon the autonomy? of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC).

 The panel, to be appointed by the state municipal affairs department, will function like the central valuation board in municipal areas and fix property tax in Calcutta.

 The six-member panel, to be headed by the municipal commissioner, will be constituted and notified by the state government every three years. The other five members will be nominated by the government.

 ?By forming the committee, the government wants to take away from the civic body the right to impose tax on landed property,? alleged CMC deputy chief law officer Shaktibrata Ghosh. ?The CMC, however, will still be responsible for delivering civic amenities to the tax payer.?

 Mukherjee argued that the government could even place people from outside the city on the panel. ?They will hardly appreciate the problems faced by Calcuttans.?

 Congress leader in the CMC Sailen Dasgupta went a step further and alleged that the CPM would stuff the panel with its cadre.

 The mayor, however, has no problem if the government agrees to consult the civic authorities before appointing the members. 

 The proposed Calcutta Municipal Corporation (Amendment) Bill makes the municipal valuation committee responsible for the assessment of annual valuation of landed properties in the city, fixing the annual property tax and its periodic reassessment.

 The civic body will publish the panel?s recommendation in the official gazette and two newspapers (one should be vernacular). The Bill is lying with a select committee of the Assembly.

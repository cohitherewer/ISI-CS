The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Build road, shift abattoir to tannery town

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC)?s decision to shift all slaughter houses to Bantala has been prodded by repeated appeals from the Asian Development Bank, the principal provider of funds for the city?s development.

 An abattoir-cum-meat processing plant will be set up on a 27-acre surplus plot of the Bantala leather complex. The plot will be handed over to the civic body by ML Dalmiya amp; Co, promoter of the leather complex project. 

 In return, the civic body will part with a stretch of land for the company to lay a 15-km road, which will connect the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass with the complex (Basanti Road). 

 The company will realise the cost for laying the road and its maintenance by collecting toll tax from vehicular traffic.

 The bank had elaborately pointed out how the slaughter houses in the city had been vitiating the environment.

 Six years ago, it had even pledged to offer a soft loan of up to Rs 25 crore for the construction of a modern abattoir-cum-meat processing plant.

 Mayor Subrata Mukherjee, who thrashed out the Bantala deal at a meeting with Jagmohan Dalmiya (of ML Dalmiya amp; Co) on Thursday, said the new centre would enable consumers to get quality meat products, prepared hygienically.

 The plant, to be built at a cost of over Rs 30 crore, is likely to be operational within two years. ?It will be set up on a turn-key basis. We will decide later whether it will be managed by us or leased out to a private firm,? Mukherjee said. 

 Each animal at the abattoir, he pointed out, will undergo ?thorough ante-mortem and post-mortem examinations? by a veterinarian.

 The plant will comprise four sections:

A stock yard or lairage, where animals will be kept under observation for at least 

24 hours

A slaughtering and flaying unit 

A processing hall (the processed products, after being salted and spiced, will 

be kept in a refrigerator in food-grade polythene packets

A rendering plant, where the viscera, head, feet, bones and other inedible offals 

will be collected and converted into tallow.

 According to the civic body?s deputy chief law officer Shaktibrata Ghosh, private slaughtering is banned in the city under the CMC Act, 1980. 

 All sellers of beef, meat, pork and chicken should get their animals or birds slaughtered at abattoirs run by the civic body.

 The CMC runs four slaughter houses ? in Tangra, Halsibagan, Allen Market and on Govinda Khatik Road. 

 Cow and buffaloes are slaughtered only in Tangra, which facility is more than 100 years old. The Govinda Khatik Road slaughter house is exclusively for pigs.

 Mayoral council members Javed Ahmed Khan and Samsuzzaman Ansari were categorical that the slaughter houses were anything but hygienic. ?A dilapidated hall, open killing, clogged surface drains and swarms of flies ? that sums up the killing chambers,? said Ansari.

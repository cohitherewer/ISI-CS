The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Lines down, ATMs dead

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 When Mumbai faces a flood, Calcutta confronts a cash crunch. Banking turned into a horror story for several Calcuttans on Wednesday, with ATMs on the blink and other facilities flopping.

 Private banks headquartered in Mumbai were ravaged by the rains, crippling customer service in Calcutta. For their ATMs, all these banks use MTNL leased lines, which were down.

 ?We have approached MTNL and they have said the network will be restored earliest by Thursday afternoon and latest by the evening,? said some bank officials, holding out hope for a return to normalcy.

 HDFC Bank, with nearly 60 ATM units, was hard hit. ?There are several lines connecting Calcutta with Mumbai and all of them are down. Even our main server in Mumbai is not functioning,? said regional manager Surendra Chawala.

 Bank sources said 24 ATM units attached to its branches and 32 other independent ATMs were affected. Around 4.30 pm, some of the machines became functional as a few lines were restored.

 For those with multiple accounts, returning to good old nationalised banks was the only option on Wednesday. ?When HDFC refused cheque transactions, I turned to UBI to bail me out,? said a harassed senior citizen.

 UTI Bank has the maximum ATM counters in and around town ? 100 in the Calcutta metro region and 52 in the Calcutta suburban area. ?Our on-site ATMs were functioning, but the rest were facing problems due to VSAT connectivity. We are helping customers with emergency withdrawals,? said S.K. Mitra, senior vice-president and zonal manager (eastern).

 IDBI Bank, whose ATMs were down in the first half, resumed operations in the afternoon. Baisakhi Banerjee, cluster head, (Bengal and Orissa), said: ?Cheque-clearing services have been affected, with Tuesday?s cheques being cleared on Wednesday.?

 State Bank of India officials said the functioning of 73 branches linked to the core banking solution platform in Mumbai were affected.

 ICICI Bank claimed to be better off, while Standard Chartered and Citibank reported no disruptions.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 The compound adjoining the Natmandir next to the Sovabazar Rajbati is used 

as a garage but it seems better looked after. The Rajbati itself is badly in need 

of restoration. The terrace is falling apart and huge cracks have appeared on 

the floor. All the beautiful stucco has come off the succession of arches and 

naked brickwork is exposed to the vagaries of nature. What is even more horrifying 

is that this heritage structure associated with such personalities as Raja Nabakrishna 

Deb, and where Vivekananda was felicitated after his return from America, is rented 

out for weddings. I shudder to think of the impact of huge crowds and cooking 

on this fragile structure.

 It would be deserving if the Central Metro station is renamed Bidhan Sadan 

station after Dr B.C. Roy as he had visualised the need for a faster mode of transport 

in the city long before Metro actually came into existence.

 Recently, I witnessed the ordeal a family of an accident victim faced at SSKM 

Hospital. After a long wait, the doctors declared that the treatment couldn?t 

begin as a bed was not available. Another hour-and-a-half was spent acquiring 

the no objection certificate from the police and getting the ?discharge on risk 

bond?. Finally, the patient was admitted to a private hospital. Equipping its 

hospitals with sufficient infrastructure to handle emergency cases should be the 

state?s first priority.

 On behalf of Ramakrishna Math, Baranagar, a money order (no. 4616) for Rs 300 

was sent to Krishna Sharma of Agra on February 26, 2004, via the Baranagar Post 

Office. When the money-order was not received by the payee, the post master of 

the post office and the Post Master General were intimated. The customer care 

centre of the postal department assured that ?arrangements are being made to issue 

a DMO? (duplicate money-order). But so far nothing has happened.

 Pranab Kumar Chakraborty, President, Ramakrishna Math, Baranagar. 

 This is with reference to the letter by S. Dutta published in this column on 

February 9. In case the writer is talking of the booking counters at the computerised 

reservation system in the new building, it is true that the building does not 

have toilets as it falls under the non-ticketing area. The ticketing area, which 

comprises the platforms, the booking offices on it and the waiting halls, has 

public toilets. There are as many as four on the Sealdah station premises, on 

platform numbers 1, 5, 8 and in the Sealdah South station. There are toilets in 

the three waiting halls on the first floor of the station building. Signages showing 

the location of the toilets are also there.

 S. Majumdar, Chief Public Relations Officer, Eastern Railway.

 Varsity duo gears up for assessment 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The Union human resources development ministry, which has earmarked Jadavpur University (JU) and Bengal Engineering and Science University (BESU) for upgrade to IIT status, will conduct inspections of the institutions on Thursday and Friday.

 A four-member team of experts from the ministry will arrive in the city on Thursday to assess the infrastructure, quality of faculty, examination system, performance, placement and research facilities of the two universities. The team will visit JU on Thursday and BESU on Friday.

 ?All preparations have been made. Today was a busy day for all of us, as the central team is expected to make an all-round inspection,? said BESU vice-chancellor N.R. Banerjea. 

 ?Each and every aspect of the infrastructure will be examined. The team members will also interact with the students and faculty,? he added.

 There was hectic activity in JU as well. Senior officials of both universities held a series of meetings during the day to chalk out ways to present the university in the best possible manner before the team. The vision plans were also discussed.

 ?Our university had submitted a detailed proposal to the ministry of human resources development after it selected us for the upgrade, from 200 engineering institutions across the country. During tomorrow?s inspection, the central officials will assess how we can transform our vision into reality,? said Partha Pratim Biswas, a senior teacher of JU and a member of the university?s executive council. 

 The inspection is significant because if the team is satisfied with what it sees, the state government will have to take a call on the upgrade issue. It is waiting for the institutes to secure a final recommendation from the Centre, before it spells out its stand. 

 According to sources, the state government fears that the terms and conditions of the Union ministry for accepting the upgrade offer ? particularly the ones regarding more financial and academic autonomy to the institutions ?may not be acceptable.

 The team is expected to submit its report to the Centre within a month.

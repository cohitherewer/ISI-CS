 Sightless in Tagore search 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A Gujarat-born blind scholar from the US is in the city for research on Tagore and his ideas on individual identity.

 Sejal Sutaria, professor of colonial and post-colonial literature at the University of Michigan and Kalamazoo College, USA, has 100 per cent visual impairment since birth, but that has not deterred her from obtaining a doctorate and pursuing research.

 According to her, Tagore?s idea of personal identity was superior to that of Gandhi?s.

 ?Gandhi envisaged a united India, where all residents will be Indians ? first to last. Tagore?s vision embraced the idea, but he also believed that the nation must provide space for individual, regional, ethnic and religious identities,? explained Sutaria.

 She has received international acclaim in colonial and post-colonial studies. ?My Ph.D was on writers between 1900 and 1947 but Tagore was the subject for one complete paper,? Sutaria stated. 

 The current trip has provided her with the opportunity to make her first visit to Santiniketan. ?I was thrilled to be there and get a feel of how Tagore implemented his ideas.? 

 The scholar held forth on her interpretation of Tagore?s views in a lecture organised by Shakespeare Society of Eastern India in collaboration with Tagore-Gandhi Institute for Cultural Studies and Service Learning. 

 ?Tagore?s vision of global inter-connectivity and interdependence was spiritual, rather than economic. He wanted to transcend the narrow parameters of nationalist ideologies,? Sutaria stressed.

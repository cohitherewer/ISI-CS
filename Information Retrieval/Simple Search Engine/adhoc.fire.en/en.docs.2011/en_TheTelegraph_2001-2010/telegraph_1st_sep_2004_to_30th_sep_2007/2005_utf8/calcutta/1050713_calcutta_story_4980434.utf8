 Parents beware: this Saturday, there is not a moment?s peace to be had once dawn breaks. Get ready to rush to the nearest bookstore or else?

 Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince will be unveiled at 6.30 am, and not 10 am, as originally planned. A ?continuous barrage of requests from bookstores? to bring the magic moment forward convinced Penguin to ease its embargo on the 10,000-book Calcutta first consignment and let the sales officially begin three-and-a-half hours ahead of schedule.

 The witching hour may have been the moment bookstores wanted to unveil the sixth edition of J.K. Rowling?s record-breaking series, but they have to be satisfied with an early start, instead. ?The midnight launch would have required special permission from the publisher, but this is our attempt to bring the launch as close to the UK release as possible,? explains Nirmalya Roychoudhury of Penguin, distributors for the Bloomsbury book in India.

 ?The embargo on sales is till Friday midnight, London time, so what is the logic of starting sales here only at 10 am?? asks Gautam Jatia, CEO, Landmark. The Lord Sinha Road store is opening at 6.30 am, with refreshments for shoppers. ?Even if it doesn?t add to sales, it will build the hype and aura around the event? And it is early enough for kids to pick up their copies before getting to school.?

 So, while stores here may lose out on an all-night party, where feet would be stepping in time with the jingle of cash registers, they are now counting on kids? powers of persuasion and competitive spirit to lure pestered parents out of the house before breakfast.

 ?Those kids who haven?t pre-booked their copy are likely to force their parents to come early. Not only is waiting an irritant for them, they would want to call up their friends and tell them they got a copy first,? explains Rajiv Choudhry of Oxford Bookstore. The store was the site of quite a few tantrums during the release of Order of the Phoenix, and a similar craze this time around is what the trade is counting on.

 Even if the early opening doesn?t significantly add to sales, stores now have little option. ?No one wants to miss the boat,? explains Crossword?s Sidhartha Pansari, who expects no more than a ?five to 10 per cent sales push here or there?, thanks to early birds.

 Organised retailers will reap more benefits than others, he adds. Big stores will remain open, and at that hour of the morning, customers will care more about safety and convenience than saving a few rupees by travelling to places like College Street, feels Pansari.

 ?Children are excited. Even if they read it later, they want to be able to say that they got their copy first,? points out Ashok Barman, owner, Family Book Shop. Last time too, in 2003, the Park Street store had jumped the gun ? or maybe the broomstick ? and opened shop at 6 am, calling all clients who had pre-booked their copies.

 ?For us, it is more of a promotion. With so many big stores opening up all around, we want to let people know the small players are still playing (the Pottermania game),? he says.

 With just four days to go, almost all stores are busy working out the logistics of designated Potter checkout counters, more in-store manpower and beefed-up security. For Landmark, it involves mobilising the entire mall?s support services, like AC crew and lift operators.

 But then, it?s hardly too much to ask for the 15-year-old boy wonder of the publishing world.

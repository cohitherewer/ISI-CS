The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Court issues clear-footpath fiat

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 ?When I visit a temple a few yards from my residence, I have to negotiate phuchkawalas and paanwalas on the footpaths. If this is the condition of the pavements in front of my house, I can well imagine how other roads in the city are.? ?Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar on Friday.

 The indictment of the police and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) came during the hearing of a case relating to problems faced by pedestrians because of encroached pavements. The division bench of the chief justice and Justice A.K. Ganguly directed police and the CMC to take all possible steps to clear the footpaths of eight major roads in the central business district.

 ?The CMC and police will first launch a joint action against shop-owners keeping goods on the footpaths. Then, they will remove all unauthorised structures. Both will have to report on the progress of work after three weeks,? the bench ruled.

 It also ordered police and the civic authorities to take steps against shop-owners encroaching on the roads by extending their establishments. It asked the departments concerned to take penal action against anyone found plying vehicles in the wrong direction.

 The court?s focus is on Brabourne Road, NS Road, Mahatma Gandhi Road, Chitpur Road, Kalakar Street, Kali Krishna Tagore Street, APC Road and CR Avenue.

 Earlier, the court had constituted a five-member committee, led by former deputy commissioner (traffic) Arun Sharma, to inspect the roads and suggest ways to make them free of hawkers and other encroachments.

 The other members of the committee were Subroto Mukherjee, Tapas Bhanja, Debasish Kar Gupta and Arindam Chatterjee, all advocates of the high court.

 The committee?s report had mentioned that the pavements of the eight roads had been encroached on by either unauthorised structures or goods of the adjoining shops. The committee recommended that the obstacles needed to be removed to ensure ?smooth movement? of pedestrians.

 The flurry of activity had been set off by a public interest litigation by environment activist Subhash Dutta, who alleged that the city?s vehicular traffic was being affected because of the ?faulty signal system?. He also alleged that pedestrians were being forced to walk on the roads, because the pavements were all occupied by hawkers.

 Wear what Rani Mukherjee does as she cuddles up in Shah Rukh Khans arms in their forthcoming flick Paheli. Priced at Rs 113,000, the neckpiece that the queen bee of Bollywood sports in the film is up for grabs at Tanishq stores across the country. The kundan creation is studded with red semiprecious stones and purple droplets. Other period pieces showcased in the Amol Palekar film are also on display.

 We were approached by the films production unit to help them create the 19th Century Rajasthani look for Ranis character, said Dwaipayan Sen, regional manager, Tanishq. This is the companys first foray into Bollywood.

 The Paheli collection was launched in the city with actress Konineeca Banerjee donning the star jewels on Wednesday. There are about 100 designs in the collection and around 40 of them are available at our stores in the city, added Sen.

 Kundan and polki (uncut diamonds) highlight the jewels, which draw inspiration from Rajasthani art and craft. Though the look is heavy and the design traditional, improvisations have been made keeping in mind the needs of the modern wearer. The sets are priced between Rs 80,000 and Rs 3 lakh.

 Tee time

 Teeing off in style has never been easier. The efforts of Artisana, the Calcutta chapter of the Crafts Council of India, has brought together women who have possibly never worn T-shirts themselves to design tops that can give big labels a run for their money.

 Just Tees, the exhibition on at the Chowringhee Terrace outlet till June end, features creations by underprivileged womens groups on one hand and designers and fashion stores like Diverscity, Sravasti and Design on the other.

 From kantha and sequin work to hand-painted Kalighat pat, batik, block-print and stones ? which are all the rage in boutique fashions ? the repertoire is wide and varied. 

 We realised that the only way to bring art and craft closer to the younger generation would be to feature them on items of daily use, and T-shirts are a good option in this regard, said a spokesperson for Artisana.

 The inauguration of the exhibition on Wednesday drew a cross-section of entertainers in the city. Musician Nondon Bagchi, actress Chaiti Ghosal and model-painter Piu Sarkar were among those who dropped by.

 The hand-embroidered and painted pieces created by the womens group Howrah Pilot stand out for both workmanship and price. The range comes at between Rs 150 and Rs 500.

 Book worming

 Landmark on Lord Sinha Road inaugurated its Bengali book corner on Tuesday. The section, launched by Sunil Gangopadhyay, will stock around 1,500 titles, from Bengali classics to works by contemporary writers.

 The Publishers and Booksellers Guild wanted to display its books but was not getting a decent place in the heart of the city. Landmark was interested in an extensive collection of Bengali literature but we were lacking proper knowledge of how to procure good books. So we decided on a tie up, explains Gautam Jatia, CEO, Landmark.

 Also on at the lifestyle store is a sale on all its products. The store has turned five last year, and we have a tradition of thanking all our loyal customers for their support, he adds.

 The prices are being slashed by up to 70 per cent on bargain books, with more moderate savings of between 10 and 30 per cent to be had on other titles. The shop, which also stocks music, toys, home and other lifestyle products, is offering 10 to 25 per cent off on everything else.

 Brand wagon

 Calcutta is fast catching up on the sales charts of Lee Cooper. The casual wear player set up shop in town 10 years ago, but over the past four years, city sales have been outstripping the southern region by far.

 For the last three years, the business has been tremendous in Calcutta, said Vishal Gupta, senior manager, sales and marketing, Indus Clothing Limited, which makes apparels and accessories for Lee Cooper in India.

 Gupta was in town to discuss the performance of the British brand and talk about its new products. Currently, about 50 per cent of revenue is generated through denim.

 Our flagship store in City Centre has registered phenomenal footfalls and sales have been high, he added. The mall boom in coming years has the company eyeing more property, too.

 Our strategy in Calcutta would be to target malls as this is where the retail revolution is taking place. Slowly, fashion streets will fade away because of the maintenance and parking problems they face. Malls, on the other hand provide a swanky and comfortable shopping option, explained Gupta.

 In the coming months, Lee Cooper wristwatches and eyewear will soon hit its standalone store as well as multi-brand outlets in the city. Innerwear for men and women, which has been a big hit in Delhi and Mumbai, will also be on a shelf near you.

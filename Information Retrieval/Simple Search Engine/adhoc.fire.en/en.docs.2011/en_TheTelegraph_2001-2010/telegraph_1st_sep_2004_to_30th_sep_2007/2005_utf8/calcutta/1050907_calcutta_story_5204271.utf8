 Room rules and business basics 

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 According to Feng 

 Shui, having the 

 master bedroom in the south-west of the 

 house is auspicious 

 for couples. The 

 kitchen should be 

 in the eastern part, 

 while the toilets shouldn rsquo;t be placed in any of the four corners of a house. Feng Shui also recommends that the corners of a house meet at right angles, thus making it a regular-shaped dwelling

Q: We got married five years back and are presently residing in a rented flat. We have decided to buy a house of our own. I would be glad if you could provide us with some important guidelines that we need to keep in mind before finalising our dream nest.

 THE SOLUTION: Look for a good and a pleasant location that is close to a park and away from a cemetery, police station or a prison. Choose a regular-shaped flat where all the four corners meet at right angles. Cosmic energy that manifests itself in the form of good luck and prosperity moves productively and unhindered in such perfect-shaped flats. 

 The main entrance should not open into a cramped area or confronted by a wall or a toilet on the opposite side. Having the master bedroom in the south-west is the first priority for a married couple. There should not be toilets in the four corners of the house, especially in the north-east, south-east and south-west. 

 Kitchen is preferred in the eastern part, with large windows towards the east. Last but not the least, ensure that the floor level of the flat inside is not lower than the common corridor level outside.

 Work worries

 Q: My father has a transferable job and hence stays out of town most of the time. My mother is not keeping too well of late. What can we do so that he gets a job somewhere in the city since we need him to stay with us?

 THE SOLUTION: According to the floor plan of your house, there is a big cut in the north-west. This area is ruled by male energy and a cut here means the house lacks this energy. This could be the reason your father stays away most of the time. 

 To get back the male energy, which will help attract your father back in the house, install a mirror on the west wall of the north-west corner. 

 Throw a soft light from the window focusing towards the void and leave it on for two to three hours every evening. 

 Finally, strengthen the weak area by keeping a heavy earthen or a metallic statue in here. The toilet in the extreme south-west corner drains away the ruling feminine energy. This is affecting your mothers health. Keep the bathroom door closed always. Again, keep a heavy boulder in the south-west corner of the bathroom. This will protect the earth energy from being sapped.

 Match making 

 Q: I have recently got engaged and will be getting married this December. My fianc? was born in the year of the rooster and I belong to the ox sign according to Chinese astrology. I am familiar with the characteristics of my own sign but have no idea about my compatibility with my partner after marriage. Please interpret the readings of our partnership.

 Siddartha

 THE SOLUTION: You, being a ox person, have a quiet and balanced nature and have the ability to keep your word once you have made a commitment. Your decisions are built on firm grounds, offering your partner reliability and security. 

 Your partner being a rooster is known to have a charming and charismatic personality and this will bring lots of fun and happiness into your otherwise quiet and drab life. 

 She will take an active interest in personal clothes, colours and designs and will also encourage you to experiment with these. She will have a strong independent personality, but somewhere within she will always look for protection. 

 Since you have a steady and dependable nature you can offer her emotional support. And this is what will appeal to her. This will make for a happy and long lasting relationship.

 Jewel jam

 Q: I have recently started my own jewellery business. I operate from a spare room in my flat. This room is in the west of the house. The entire stock is stored in the south-west of the room and my table is in the north-west, where I stand facing south while showing jewellery to my customers. The problem is that customers admire and appreciate the ornaments but do not buy. They mostly leave with the promise to return later. I have invested my personal savings into this business and if it doesnt pick up I will be at a great loss. Please help.

 Maya

 THE SOLUTION: Without wasting time rearrange the set-up of your jewellery outlet. Stabilise yourself and your business by placing your table in the south-west of the room and face north while showing the jewellery. 

 Having your back towards the north, which is directly connected with business, is symbolic of refusing any business opportunities flowing your way. 

 Store your valuable collections in the north-west cupboard of the room. This area being ruled by movement will help move away all your pieces of jewellery without leaving any dead stock behind.

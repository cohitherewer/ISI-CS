Two faces of torture: Varnika, home and not 

alone; Guria, home in cruel company 

Torture of domestic helps has become commonplace in 

many a household. Even a World Health Organisation official and his wife found 

nothing wrong in torturing Guria. She was rescued last November due to the efforts 

of a few selfless students and Sister Cyril of Loreto Day School, Sealdah. 

 Soon after, the death of 17-year-old Sunita Sau was reported. She, too, was a victim of torture. An apartment in Bhowanipore witnessed mob frenzy over the incident. Inquiry into the matter, however, was not expedited. 

 What is unfortunate is the media coverage of the heinous acts do not send any message to the perpetrators. In the absence of deterrent laws, they go unpunished. Had there been legal provisions to curb the menace, another Gudiya would not have face the rage of her employer?s Alsatian. 

 How insensitive are we to the rights of these wretched fellows! From Day One, we are shamelessly callous about their basic minimum requirement, though we tether them to service round the clock. We deny them the minimum wage fixed by the government. Food and lodging provided to them are not fit for human beings. To top it all, filthy language is rained on them to squeeze out their last iota of energy. 

 There must exist strict rules to monitor the condition of the domestic helps. Before they are engaged in service, the employer must consult local committees and Nagarik Samitis, which can keep a tab on their well-being. To ensure the safety of domestic helps, they must be allowed to have community discussions at least once a month. 

 It is heartening that Gudiya has managed to conquer her destiny (Doubts hound girl?s fate, March 11). Now she must be rehabilitated. But the administration must see that she is not trapped in another ?happy home?. 

Subhankar Mukherjee,

Borehat.

Apropos the report ?Child beaten, hair yanked off?, March 17, it is disheartening to note that today?s teachers lack compassion towards their own students. The teachers often punish youngsters so brutally that it makes the headlines. It is high time to rein in teachers from torturing students in the name of punishment 

Sunil Banerjee,

VIP Road. 

It is shocking that a teacher has not only mercilessly 

beaten up a five-year-old student but also yanked off a tuft of hair from her 

head. This was supposedly a punishment for not carrying her art work. If the teacher 

is found guilty after investigation, she should be punished in an exemplary manner. 

Sourish Misra, 

 Salt Lake. 

The way Varnika Gupta was tortured by her teacher 

is quite frightening. Her behaviour was barbaric and she should be made to pay 

for it. 

Prahlad Agarwala, 

 Majdia, Nadia. 

Good teachers seldom raise their hands on their students. 

Art teacher Ruma Pal?s inhuman treatment of a five-year-girl who did not listen 

to her highlights only her incompetence. The way the student was treated has brought 

infamy to the school. The headmistress of Our Lady Queen of the Missions in Salt 

Lake should ensure that such an incident is not repeated. 

Bhupen Bose, 

 Dum Dum. 

The art teacher?s act of brutality on a nursery student 

sends shivers down the spine. How could Pal dare to inflict such inhuman punishment 

on a child when physical punishment has been banned by the Supreme Court? Is she 

bereft of all human feelings? 

Govinda Bakshi, 

 Budge Budge. 

The media coverage of the Varnika Gupta incident and 

the public reaction has been disgraceful. The extent to which we have distanced 

ourselves from common sense and logic is quite frightening. It should have been 

obvious to everyone that if Varnika Gupta had been beaten up and a tuft of her 

hair pulled out, she would have been in terrible pain. There would also have been 

signs of injury on her head. It is apparent from your report that Varnika was 

fairly okay when she went home, hours after the alleged incident. A proper medical 

examination would prove that the hair loss was due to some other reason. I do 

not claim that Ruma Pal is innocent, but I strongly believe that the media should 

have been more mature while covering the incident. It is dangerous if the media 

starts to indicate that someone is guilty before he or she is proven so. 

L. Biswas, 

 Salt Lake. 

Incidences of students being tortured by teachers 

are becoming increasingly common. Can Ruma Pal ever punish her children the same 

way she punished Varnika? It is quite likely that Varnika?s parents pack her schoolbag, 

so in case she forgot to bring something, her parents should have been informed. 

Teachers who ill-treat students do not command respect and deservedly so. 

Dinabandhu Mukherjee, 

 Behala. 

Some people have said in Ruma Pal?s defence that it 

is very difficult to handle 30-40 children of Varnika Gupta?s age in class. They 

should remember that the teachers are paid to handle children with care and affection. 

Govinda Das Dujari, 

 Diamond Harbour Road. 

It is sad that people like Ruma Pal are coming into 

the teaching profession. It is sadder that there are schools which employ such 

people. 

Shiv Shankar Almal, 

 Lower Rawdon Street. 

Teachers and school administrators need regular psychological 

help to behave properly with children. The government should make counselling 

mandatory. 

Hara Lal Chakraborty, 

 Arabinda Nagar. 

The allegation that a teacher of our school pulled 

out a tuft of hair from a five-year-old?s head is preposterous. The teacher is 

appreciated by parents for being motherly and concerned for the well-being of 

her wards. A section of the media and people with vested interest are blowing 

the incident out of proportion. 

Teachers of Our Lady Queen of the Missions School, 

Salt Lake. 

The photograph ?My grandmother and her past?, a prize-winning image, was mistakenly credited to Gopal Ganguly in the story ?Click tribute to diversity?, April 5. The photograph was taken by Subhasish Banerjee.

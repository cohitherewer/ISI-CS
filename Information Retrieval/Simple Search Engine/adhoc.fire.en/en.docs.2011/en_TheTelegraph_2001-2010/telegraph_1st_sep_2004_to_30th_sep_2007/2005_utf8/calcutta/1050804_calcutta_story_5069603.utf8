 Murmurs of medical JEE alternative

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Nibedita Roy, a post-doctorate degree-holder from a US-based university, is now a scientist in genetic engineering. Had she been a heart surgeon, she would have considered herself more successful.

 The former zoology student of Presidency College had scored more than 90 per cent in her ISC (bio-science) examinations. She had taken the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) twice but failed to make it to the merit list for studying medicine.

 Keeping in mind high-performing students like Nibedita, the state government is toying with the idea of filling its 1,105 seats in medical courses on the basis of marks obtained in the Higher Secondary, ISC or CBSE examinations. 

 The new selection procedure, if implemented, will replace the nearly three-decade-old system of admissions through the JEE.

 ?We are examining thoroughly whether we should introduce admissions on the basis of marks obtained in Higher Secondary or its equivalent examinations,? state health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra said on Wednesday.

 The Tamil Nadu government had abolished the JEE for admission to medical courses from the current year. But Madras High Court had set aside the decision on admitting students on the basis of their X+II marks.

 Students aspiring to enrol in medical courses have demanded admission on the basis of high school marks, as even Medical Council of India rules do not make it mandatory for the state governments to conduct a centralised entrance test for admission to undergraduate medical courses. 

 It is, however, compulsory for the states to admit students to postgraduate medical courses through entrance tests only. 

 ?Students who score very high marks in the X+II examinations and yet fail to qualify for the medical courses will definitely benefit if the JEE is abolished. We have to find out whether the move will aid the maximum number of candidates,? the minister pointed out.

 He, however, added that the main hurdle in admitting students on the basis of X+II marks was the different examinations and marking patterns followed by the school boards.

 The government is working on a proposal to evolve a system to fix a certain percentage of marks for various boards to aid the screening process, Mishra said.

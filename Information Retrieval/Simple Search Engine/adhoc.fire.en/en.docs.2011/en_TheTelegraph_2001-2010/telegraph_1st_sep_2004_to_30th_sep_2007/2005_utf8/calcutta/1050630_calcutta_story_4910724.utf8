 A look into the Spencers Hypermarket at Malad, Mumbai 

 More than 120,000 sq ft of convenience retail space spread across four distinct formats and six superstores ? all inside the next financial year. A change of guard at the top and a fresh focus on its flagship metro have combined to trigger a supermarket surge by RPG Enterprises, and the Calcutta customer is set to reap the harvest of the rapid acceleration on the spear-tip of the Spencers brand.

 Shopping for rice and staples and other KVIs (known value items) in air-conditioned comfort is now par for the course. As the only pure grocery-format player in the country, we can add an emphatic better-quality and fair-price assurance to the touch-feel experience, said Sumantra Banerjee, president amp; chief executive, retail group of RPG Enterprises. 

 The four Spencers models being readied to roll into Calcutta are the 25,000-sq-ft and more Spencers Hypermarket, the 8,000-12,000-sq-ft Superstore, the 4,000-sq-ft-odd Supermarket and a 2,000-sq-ft sub of the Supermarket called Spencers Fresh, dealing in just food and beverages.

 While the first three formats are convenience stores, the hypermarts will be destination stores, on the lines of those in Hyderabad, Mumbai and Visakhapatnam. By the last quarter of this financial year, we should have six Supermarkets/Fresh up and running in Calcutta, says Banerjee.

 These will be followed by the two Spencers Hypermarkets, at Mani Square on the EM Bypass next to Apollo Gleneagles (51,000 sq ft), and at the South City Mall (72,000 sq ft). 

 The group wants to follow the duck and duckling model in Calcutta, with two, maybe three Hypermarkets anchoring the flanks.

 Then, we can plug the holes in between with the smaller Spencers convenience formats wherever theres an opportunity and a need, adds Banerjee.

 Once the first flush of Spencers outlets are seeded in the city, the group is also contemplating a second destination store of MusicWorld, the RPG Enterprises music retail chain. 

 The south, preferably around the Gariahat area, could be a good location for a second big store, which can then concentrate on regional repertoire, while Park Street can focus a little more on international and Hindi stuff, observes Banerjee.

 The chain, which is scouting for properties in the city, is in fast-forward mode nationally as well, with a million sq ft of space to be operational by the next financial year.

 A typical Spencers Hypermarket, harping on its bada choice, chhota price slogan, stocks over 20,000 items including F amp;B, staples, chills and frozen, garments, home and play, FMCG food and non-food, beauty and accessories, brown and white goods, general merchandising, home accessories and electrical fittings, and the works.

 The group is planning to open around 20 Spencers Hypermarkets by the end of next year and the objective is to book another million sq ft in the next 12-15 months, confirms Banerjee. 

 To shave costs and manage its high-speed stores more efficiently, the group is collapsing its backend and integrating merchandising operations.

 Are there enough challenging roles for our stage actors? Are young learners looking for shortcuts to fame? Does dedication take a backseat when there is no steady source of income? More questions were raised than answered at the seminar which kicked off Odeon 2005 on Friday.

 Where have the actors gone? was the subject of discussion at the fifth edition of the theatre festival, hosted annually by cell phone service provider Hutch, which found a bunch of theatre veterans from the city and beyond sharing their thoughts. 

 Konkona Sen Sharma compered the event at Crossword Bookstore, with mother Aparna Sen attending as chief guest.

 The speakers comprised stage director Arun Mukherjee, writer-director Gowri Ramnarayan, actors Dhritiman Chaterji and Jagannath Guha. Arts commentator Samik Bandopadhyay set the ball rolling, saying that the educational institutions did not quite match up to the requirements of theatre actors. 

 But veteran Arun Mukherjee lamented the lack of a professional platform even after so many years. 

 Utpal Dutt had quit his job to do theatre but he worked in films for a livelihood. If an actor doesnt get a minimum decent living why should he take up theatre as a career? Besides, are enough interesting plays being written to offer challenging roles to actors? wondered the director of theatre group Chetana.

 Jagannath Guha felt an actor could never resist his or her calling. When we started off, acting was a ticket to starvation, he reminisced. Recounting her experiences in Tamil Nadu, Gowri Ramnarayan shed light on the growing trend among young theatre enthusiasts to learn acting in the span of a month. And since you have chosen to do it, shouldnt you do it more brilliantly? she asked. 

 Dhritiman Chaterji, who does theatre in Chennai, felt it is necessary to differentiate between performance in front of an audience and performance as a development of ones skills. 

 The external practice has to generate money to sustain the internal practice, he observed. 

 And if actors move from one group to another, then what is the identity of a group? Is it the personality of the director or the success of the group that is its essence? This is a paradox and I dont have solutions, admitted Chaterji, leaving the listeners with many a point to ponder.

 Rustic art

 Hidden away in remote villages of Bengal, craftsmen toil to create aesthetic items for urban patrons. In an effort to showcase such talent, Nimble Fingers, a city-based NGO has organised an exhibition at the Academy of Fine Arts New South Gallery till June 30, from 3 pm to 8 pm.

 Among those present at the inauguration were Piu Sarkar, sculptress Uma Sidddhanta, jewellery designer Nilanjana Chakraborty, Odissi danseuse Sanchita Bhattacharyya and actress June. 

 Most of the artisans sell their work through middlemen and get very little for their efforts. This is a platform for them to get noticed, explains Shyamshree Sen of Nimble Fingers. 

 Rural artisans will be exhibiting a range of traditional products like dokra, terracotta, buffalo-horn craft, hand-made paper items, wood craft, papier mache, paper masks and madur (grass mat) amongst others.

 Bedspreads, oven mittens, aprons embellished with applique work are colourful, decorative and yet useful for every homemaker.

 There is also an interesting range of buffalo horn kitchen appliances,with the bird-shaped containers meriting special mention.

 The terracotta and shell jewellery are good buys for women with an eye for fashion.The shell belts are trendy enough to pack in for an evening out. 

 The terracotta sculptures, colourful pots and dokra show pieces are unique and definite eye catchers.

 A variety of photo frames, pen-stands and hand-made paper diaries with poems by the likes of Sunil Gangopadhyay on their covers could serve as perfect gifts.

 Paintings etched in clay and framed using mat and cloth are rare finds. And not to be missed are the soap carvings by Subhro Banerjee, a talented mentally-challenged artist.

 The price tag for the showpieces ranges from Rs 20 to Rs 4,500, while the dokra pieces start at Rs 45 and can go up to Rs 2,500. The jewellery is reasonable, at between Rs 20 and Rs 75.

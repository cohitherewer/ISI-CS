The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

You can?t get through this week without?

Going on a fruity diet

In case you hadn?t noticed while pigging on Poila 

savouries, summer coolers have arrived in the shape of juicy watermelons and slurpy 

mangoes. Makes sense to adhere to them for a while if you wish to fit into that 

bikini without snapping a strap.

Lapping up LIFW

You don?t have to be a fashion victim to take an interest 

in the style extravaganza of the year starting on Wednesday in Delhi. Root for 

the city designers at the Lakme India Fashion Week and hope it serves up another 

Pepsi. Even if you don?t feel tempted enough to place an order, at least you?ll 

be able to pick up enough tips to get your neighbourhood tailor to do a designer 

rehash at one-fourth the price!

Drooling over Zayed

As he shakes a leg at Fusion on Saturday. If you want 

him to utter the reassuring Main hoon naa, make sure you lose your partner 

before you venture out!

Watching Hazaaron...

With seven new films to choose from this week, it 

will be a tough choice, what with the Will Smiths and Sandip Rays jostling for 

attention alongside the Shilpa Shettys and Mahima Chaudhurys. Go for something 

immensely more sane, with a lot of sense and sensibility ? Sudhir Mishra?s Hazaaron 

Khwaishein Aisi. With sparkling performances by the lead trio of Kay Kay Menon, 

Chitrangda Singh and Shiney Ahuja, the film takes you on a politically charged 

power trip where three individuals charter their own courses through pain and 

pleasure and everything in between.

 Planning vacations

Go before the kids learn how to spell Switzerland. 

Once that happens, there would be no deterring them for you can trust the tykes 

to be aware enough that air fares are falling, falling and falling! So, go near 

or far, but make sure you do go someplace else this summer. Otherwise, what will 

the neighbours say, pray?

 They had left their home and hearth to explore better opportunities in an alien land. And over the decades, Calcutta not only managed to fulfil their dreams but also made their future generations stay on.

 Around 400 families from Jodhpur, settled in Calcutta over the years, celebrated the spirit of togetherness on Sunday through music, felicitation of elders and a website launch.

 ?It is essential that we keep these people together and develop a bond among them,? says Shekhar Mehta, president of the 40-year-old Jodhpur Association, which organised the get-together.

 Set up initially to help the new families arriving from Jodhpur find their feet in the city, the association now tries to play a greater role in facilitating interaction between members of the community.

 Around 50 per cent of the 400 families are second-generation Rajasthanis. ?At that time, Rajasthan did not have the resources to do justice to the talents of these people and Calcutta did,? says Mehta, whose father migrated to the city in the early 50s.

 Sunday?s programme, held at Vidya Mandir, saw the launch of a website and a monthly bulletin. 

 ?Called Marudhar (land of deserts), the magazine will contain information on members, their achievements and articles penned by them.?

 The website, www.jodhpurassociation.org, will host a database of the members and information on job opportunities for those wishing to move to Calcutta from Jodhpur.

 ?We also plan to launch a matrimonial section soon for those seeking prospects within the community,? adds Mehta.

 At Sunday?s event, the two oldest living past presidents of the association were honoured for their contribution over the years.

 This was the first programme organised by the association?s new executive committee, which took over in June. ?We plan to hold at least 12 such programmes in a year,? offers Mehta. 

 A cultural programme by the members on national integration, called Ma Tujhe Salam, is scheduled for August.

 As families continue to trickle in from the desert land, the association is trying to spread the word about Calcutta to the neighbouring districts of Jodhpur like Nagore, Pali and Osian.

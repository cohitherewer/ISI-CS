He has proven his worth as an actor, on screens big 

and small. Now, Arjun Chakraborty has taken the plunge into another creative world.

On January 1, Arjun launched his maiden solo album 

Mon Chai, a collection of six love songs, at a packed-to-capacity Rang 

Manch in Swabhumi, as part of the New Year party hosted by Harsh Neotia. 

?The songs have been addressed to an imaginary beloved,? 

smiles the charming actor-turned-singer.

They are based on various Indian classical ragas. 

The half-hour rendition on the day of the launch, with Calcutta?s elite tuned 

in, found Arjun unfazed. He sang in style with lyricist and music director Swagatalakshmi 

Dasgupta matching the occasional chord with him.

The album, released by Prime Music, has songs interspersed 

with dialogue, adding to the album?s nostalgic feel.

Bizzy bash

Glamour and glitz pervaded EZCC, Salt Lake, as the 

International School of Business amp; Media hosted Jamboree, its maiden annual 

carnival from January 1.

The open-air cultural complex was abuzz with activity 

from morning as students rushed around stitching together an event bringing some 

of the best institutes of professional studies and big names from various fields 

including designer Kiran Uttam Ghosh, dancer Alokananda Roy and actress Deboleena 

Dutt.

The first day of the fest kicked-off with a cricket 

tournament featuring the likes of Wigan amp; Leigh, Globsyn, Frankfinn and Heritage. 

The more interesting twist to the first-day tale came 

when enthusiastic students gave up their bats and pads for pots and pans, taking 

part in a cookery ontest judged by Rakhi Purnima Dasgupta of Kewpie?s.

Day Two offered a plethora of events starting with 

a business quiz conducted by Barun Das. 

Next on the cards were Antakshari and a choreography 

show, followed by mind games and a corporate debate, again moderated by Das. 

A fashion show put up by the students enthused the 

audience as well as guests. ?I am impressed with their professionalism,? observed 

Rita Bhimani.

Amit Ganguly and Bijoya Ganguly created nostalgic 

moments with their music, but it was Swastik, a band of Calcutta boys, that really 

got the crowd going on the dance floor. 

The two-day carnival sponsored by Airtel was crowned 

with a gala dinner.

?This is a case-study of students who work very hard 

to organise every minute detail of an event and then strategise on how to make 

it a super success,? said Sudhi Ranjan Dey, director of the institute.

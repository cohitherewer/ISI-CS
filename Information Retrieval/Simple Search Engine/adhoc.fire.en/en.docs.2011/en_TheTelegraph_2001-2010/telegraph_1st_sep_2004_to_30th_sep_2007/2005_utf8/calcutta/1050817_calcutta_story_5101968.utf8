 Scribbling on paper in this age of email and SMS might not be your style, but cute little monkey message holders just might be the inspiration for you to start writing once again. 

 Spruce up your study table or office desk with the interesting new message holders in electric splashes of red, yellow and brown. The cartoon animal holding the chit of paper adds a spark of humour to your messaging.

Its not just message holders that Mr Monkey adorns, there are mobile holders and a host of other stuff as well.

 Toothbrush holders with the adorable monkey smiling away to glory with a little pink tongue sticking out can be a great way of inculcating healthy habits in your kids. Just put these on the toilet racks and see how eager they are to brush their teeth, morning and night. 

 Made of polyresin, with fine finish and attractive colours, this imported range of monkey holders is popular with people of all ages, says Gautam Shroff of Archies Gallery at City Centre.

 With Raksha Bandhan round the corner, you can gift your kid brother or sister photo frames or table clocks with the monkey motif. The photo frames have the monkey sitting on top, striking many a pose with little monkey inscribed below. 

 l you have to do is add a photograph of your brother or sister for the complete picture! And the clocks have Mr Monkey carrying the dial on his back.

 Schools add glitter to green study

 Environmental education (EVE) textbooks are not up to the mark and the interest of students in the subject ? both new and compulsory ? is waning, leaving schools with no option but to devise ways on their own to make the topics appealing.

 In the absence of any training programme by the ICSE and CBSE councils on how to teach the subject, schools are hosting workshops for teachers to develop games and practical exercises to explain to students the necessity of preserving the environment.

 Sandhya Ray, biology teacher at Lakshmipat Singhania Academy, attended one such workshop organised by Trailblazers Environment Consultancy. ?Some very simple and effective methods of teaching EVE were discussed at the workshop. These can easily be implemented to make the subject interesting,? says Ray.

 The ideas discussed at the workshop include involving students in water audits (to measure water wastage) and building an actual food web (to help children realise the inter-dependence of biotic and abiotic elements). ?That?s not all. A lot more can be developed on these lines,? says Anjali Razdan, principal of Lakshmipat Singhania.

 Other schools working on ways to draw students? attention to environmental education are Mahadevi Birla, Modern High and Birla High for boys and girls.

 ?In fact, I have already made some of the students carry out a water audit,? says a teacher at Mahadevi Birla.

 Sharmila Bose, principal of Birla High School for Girls, says: ?We have introduced some methods to make the topics relevant to children. Besides, we have implemented a waste management programme and a compost heat system. A rainwater harvesting project is in the pipeline.?

 According to Mukta Nain, principal of Birla High School for Boys, the subject has been ?introduced so suddenly that we are still coping with the syllabus. By next year, we hope to improvise and supplement the teaching methods.?

 Ranjan Biswas, of Trailblazers, feels there is no other subject that can be made more interesting to students than environmental education. But, he adds, ?unless you show a child how he is affected by the environment, you can?t draw him towards it?.

 Joint entrance bar on switch 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The state joint entrance examination (JEE) board wants to ensure that all students studying in the two top-ranking engineering institutions ? Jadavpur University (JU) and Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur (BESU) ? are of the highest quality. To that end, the board has decided to hold simultaneous counselling for aspirants to engineering and medical colleges so that they do not switch courses later.

 Till last year, admissions to engineering courses were completed by mid-June, immediately after the announcement of the JEE results. Admission to medical colleges was held almost a month later. JEE officials said several students who had qualified for both engineering and medical courses first admitted themselves at JU or BESU, and then changed streams later.

 Medical students are admitted after engineering students as there is a rule stipulating that medical colleges can admit students only after the announcement of the Higher Secondary results. The state government is considering amending the rule, officials said. ?We want to abolish the old system because it often led to vacancies, as students quit midway. The seats then had to be filled up by students of lesser merit,? said N.R. Banerjea, vice-chancellor, BESU, and chairman of the JEE board.

 The counselling of students is likely to be held between June 8 and June 15 this year, Banerjea added.

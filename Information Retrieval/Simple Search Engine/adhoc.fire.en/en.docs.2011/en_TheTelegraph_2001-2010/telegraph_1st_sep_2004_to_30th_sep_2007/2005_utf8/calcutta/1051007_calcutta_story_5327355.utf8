The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cell swipers outwit cops

 PRONAB MONDAL

 Once again, a police claim is biting the dust.

 Cocking a snook at the ?elaborate security arrangements? at malls and stores, lifters and pickpockets are making a killing, just like every year, as the Puja shopping spree has reached its peak. The only difference this year is that instead of wallets, shoppers are finding their cell phones missing.

 According to police sources, the maximum number of complaints relating to cell phone thefts are being received from New Market, Sreeram Arcade, Metro Plaza, AC Market on Shakespeare Sarani, Gariahat and Bowbazar. 

 ?The police stations in these areas are receiving five to seven complaints daily,? disclosed an officer of the detective department. ?Altogether, 40 to 50 thefts are being reported daily at eight police stations. Unfortunately, we have not been able to recover a single stolen phone.?

 The thefts were first reported a couple of weeks ago, said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner (I), detective department. ?We had taken all precautionary measures to protect buyers and shop-owners from pickpockets and lifters. Still, a section of criminals is carrying on business, taking advantage of the crowd and the fact that most shoppers are inattentive to their belongings while sifting through the items on display.?

 Singh claimed that officers of the watch section had been stationed at all important markets. ?The police stations, too, were asked to deploy their men in plain clothes.? But the trained squads seem to be no match to the lifters? gangs.

 An officer of Shakespeare Sarani thana said lifters and pickpockets entered the crowded malls and stores pretending to be customers. 

 ?They position themselves close to their targets. The moment they spot a targeted buyer busy choosing items, they swing into action.?

 Not just malls, thefts have also been reported from stand-alone shops. ?A buyer has complained that he had lost his cell phone while purchasing clothes in a shop on Park Street,? said a sleuth. ?Lifters and pickpockets keep a close watch on shops that draw huge crowds before the Pujas.?

 To celebrate the brief Calcutta winter, Soumyas Creation at 57/9, Ballygunge Circular Road is hosting an exhibition titled Dress-up December. 

 The exhibition boasts a variety of home accessories and garments for the season.

 The home decor section includes ceramic ware, durries, framed Madhubani paintings and some stunning candles. The ornament collection is quite extensive with costume jewellery ranging from beads, shells, Swarovski crystals and eye-catching silver pieces to the more traditional ethnic designs with semi-precious stones.

 You can take your pick from a whole range of skirts and T-shirts in bright raw silk and cotton. 

 Besides, theres a host of Chanderi and Bangalore silk-based tussar saris.

 While the candles are made by Silence, an organisation for the physically challenged and hearing impaired, and Asha Niketan, a centre dealing with the mentally challenged, the Chanderi garments are part of a cluster development project impacting 200 weaver families.

 All my products are very reasonably priced, starting as low as Rs 30. You can call Soumyas Creation a budget destination for quality products, says Sudatta Chakraborty, proprietor, Soumyas Creation.

 The exhibition is on till December 26.

 Funds crunch hits civic services

 Subodh Roy: The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) developed the Baishnabghata-Patuli project and is still looking after it. But the residents of the township pay tax to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC). Due to this, the CMDA is probably suffering from shortage of funds and cannot provide civic amenities to the residents. Will you please throw light on the issue?

 It was initially decided that the CMDA would hand over the Baishnabghata-Patuli project to the CMC after its completion. The work was delayed due to various reasons, and as a result, the cost of the project escalated. The CMDA incurred the expenditure, but as the CMC is the sanctioning authority, residents pay tax to it.

 Consequently, the CMDA does not have enough money to maintain the project. To tide over the crisis, the CMDA and CMC have joined hands to provide the necessary services. I have decided to take up the issue after the Puja. I also have plans to undertake a survey with the CMDA and see if the CMC can take charge of the project from next year.

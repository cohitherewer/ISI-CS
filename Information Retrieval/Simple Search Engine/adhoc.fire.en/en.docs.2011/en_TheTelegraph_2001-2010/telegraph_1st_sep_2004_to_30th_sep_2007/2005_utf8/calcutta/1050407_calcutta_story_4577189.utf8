Wax and wick for wedding wonders

Feng Shui Matters

Pinky Kapoor

 According to Feng Shui rules, south-west is the 

direction associated with marriage. Placing a pair of candles in this corner of 

a couples bedroom and lighting them every evening energises this area and 

hence brings good luck to them. Placing a bowl full of water or salt in this area 

helps suppress negative vibes

Q: I have been married for the past seven 

months and live with my husband outside Calcutta. I have not enjoyed a single 

moment of happiness with him after marriage. My parents are prepared to support 

me if I decide to leave him and return to them. But since it was my own decision 

to marry him, I don?t want to think of divorce so early. Can you suggest ways 

to improve my position ?

 The Solution: Just as the physical body protects the soul, the home protects its occupants. We are connected to our environment so strongly that any kind of imbalance affects us. Most essential for you is to check whether the south-west corner (marriage area) exists in the house. Marriage becomes a mess if this area falls out of the house. If it is missing, bring back the lost energy by introducing a strong floodlight here. Next, check whether the Chi of every corner of each room is emitting positive vibes, particularly your marriage corner. This area should not contain objects that give out negative vibes like dustbins, brooms, mops etc. Sometimes, the room you occupy could also have negative Flying Stars existing. These stars cause a lot of unwanted friction, misunderstanding and fighting between its occupants. Keeping a heavy stone on the floor in the south-west corner of your bedroom will work best to suppress them. You can also try placing a shallow bowl filled with fresh salt or a pot of still water covered in this corner every evening.

Q: I had always wanted to energise the south-west 

corner of my bedroom after marriage with my wedding pictures, candles, crystals 

and objects that suggest unison. But a toilet occupies the south-west in my house. 

Should I energise it?

Name withheld

 The Solution: Don?t place anything related to your marriage in the toilet and certainly not your photographs. The marriage corner is already afflicted, so don?t strengthen it by keeping anything that suggests togetherness. Instead, strongly activate the immediate south-west corner of your bedroom with all the objects that you had wanted to display and highlight this area by lighting a pair of candles every evening. You can also display mementoes that you picked on your honeymoon.

Q: We have recently moved into a large flat 

where the entrance is from the north. The floor level of the entire flat is lower 

than that of the corridor. Can this invite problems in future? The flat is designed 

such that there are bedrooms in all four directions. The room in the north-east 

is the biggest and has a beautiful balcony with it. Can I convert this into the 

master bed?

 The Solution: It is definitely not in accordance with Feng Shui rules to enter into a depressed level from outside. It is symbolic of going down in life. The best solution would be to raise the floor level of the whole flat. If this is not possible, then at least the backside of the flat that includes the south-east, south and south-west should definitely be raised to give the required support. North-east sector is best used for a worship room because the pious energy prevailing here helps in meditation and mental well-being. But, if a married couple occupies this room then spiritual and material energy will mingle and disturb them mentally. They will have to try hard to balance spiritual bliss and worldly happiness. South-west rooms are considered best for married couples because the ruling earth energy blesses the occupants with its strength, gravity, tolerance and stability.

 Pay scale splits campus

 - JU science and arts faculty peeved at IIT status prospect

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Jadavpur University (JU) is now a campus divided over the potential disparity in pay packets.

 As the engineering faculty of Jadavpur University awaits its IIT status upgrade, the science and arts departments, located only a few blocks away, are peeved at the possibility of two sets of pay-scale rules creeping into the campus.

 The IIT tag is likely to come through after a visit by a three-member team of the ministry of human resource development last week.

 The upgrade would mean, among other things, better infrastructure and higher pay scales for teachers and non-teaching staff members of the 17 departments and nine schools of advanced studies under the engineering faculty.

 The Centre, however, is yet to clarify whether it would provide assistance for upgrading the science and arts departments as well, along with the engineering faculty.

 Teachers of the two departments are planning to protest the ?differentiation? in pay scales.

 ?The question of separate structures for the departments does not arise in a university where teachers have always remained under a single pay scale,? said Chittaranjan Mondal, a science faculty teacher and general secretary of Jadavpur University Teachers? Association. ?And the teachers want to remain under the same system in future, too,? Mondal added.

 The concern over the issue of lower pay scales had also figured in last week?s discussion between JU authorities and the ministry team, which had expressed satisfaction after the ?on-the-spot inspection?, sources present at the meeting said.

 Sources also pointed out that the university authorities have verbally assured the teachers that once the Centre approves the IIT upgrade, they would ask the University Grants Commission (UGC) for more funds to provide financial and other benefits to the science and arts departments.

 JU, like all other state-aided universities, follows UGC guidelines for pay scales and other facilities to all its three faculties. 

 ?At least on two earlier occasions, the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), which regulates all engineering courses in the country, had proposed to JU that it offer the council pay scales to the engineering and technology department teachers,? said a university teacher. 

 ?Though some of the benefits under the AICTE scales are better than the UGC ones, the proposals were not implemented,? he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Tiger Woods 

You are honest, patient and an idealist. You don?t make an emotional commitment easily. You are casual about your spending, but 

 punctual about 

 deadlines. You like to 

 work in small teams 

 and are made for 

 positions of power. 

 Your jovial nature 

 makes you 

 popular. ? Kusum 

 Bhandari

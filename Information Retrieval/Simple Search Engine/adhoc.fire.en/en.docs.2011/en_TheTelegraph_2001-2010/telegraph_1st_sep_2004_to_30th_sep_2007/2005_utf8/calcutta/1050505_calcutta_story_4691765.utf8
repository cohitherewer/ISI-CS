 Stopping short of success: Rok Sako to 

Rok Lo 

 This is apropos the article ?Balancing art amp; 

commerce? on Arindam Chaudhuri. Being involved with the film industry for 40 years, 

I have a few questions for this management guru. 

 I understand that he is making six Hindi and Bengali movies. The first one in Bengali is directed by ad guru (who despite a few disasters at the box-office, is showered with new projects) Rituparno Ghosh, starring Prosenjit and Konkona, which will, I believe cost no less than Rs 80 lakh. Then there is another Hindi film by the same man, for which the bill is slated to run to at least Rs 3 crore. The third is a Bengali film by another flop director Anjan Das with Mithun Chakraborty ? meaning Rs 1 crore. Another in Hindi by Aziz Mirza is in the pipeline, costing Rs 6 crore. I am sure our management guru will manage to arrange this money with a snap of his finger, despite dismal financial showing on his completed projects. But my question is, who are the chickens who are investing their money for his projects? In the article, he says ?I don?t mind if the film doesn?t break even.? I am sure he does not, because chances are it is not his money. 

 Film business is not like any other business, where terms like ?bullish? and ?bearish? make sense. This is a different ball game altogether. Management ideas do not work here, no matter how much hype you want to create. 

 This is a trade where Goopi Gayen Bagha Bayen is a greater success than Pather Panchali and Beder Meye Jyotsna is a much bigger hit than all of Ray?s films put together, for uncanny reasons. But Chaudhuri knows he has got nothing to lose.

The report ?Math minus phobia is new aim of teachers?, April 13, was heartening. Though I do not teach mathematics, for 16 years, as a class teacher, I have encountered the phobia in different degrees at various levels. Even parents are not exempt from it. Students who do not do well in the math exam, often perform miserably in the rest of the exams and I have seen students fall ill during math tests. Even the best students are not without fear of math. So, it?s a pleasure to know that teachers are coming up with ideas to help students love the subject. 

Kaberi Mukherjea,

Santosh Roy Road. 

Apropos the report ?Transfers trigger hospital tumult?, April 9, it was unbecoming of senior doctors to disrupt work at Nilratan Sirkar Hospital to protest the transfer of two professors. With state-run hospitals facing an infrastructural crisis, patients who do not have any option but to be treated there bank on the expertise of doctors there. If they, too, discontinue treatment on the plea of protest, then who would these patients turn to? 

Sunil Banerjee, 

VIP Road.

Apropos The City Diary item ?Parking fee case?, April 13, a writ petition was filed by Gitanjali Fee Car Parking Co-operative Society and others before Justice Soumitra Sen against the Corporation for suspending the tender floated without assigning any reason. The Fee Parking Employees Co-operative Society later filed a writ petition challenging the tender notice. Both were heard analogously on April 12. 

Jagadish Chowdhuri,

Jogendra Garden. 

We are thankful to Shyam Benegal for showing the courage to present Netaji as the national leader he was, when everyone else is in the process of forgetting him (Why should Netaji be Bengali hero?, April 14). I have another observation to make. On January 18, 2004, The Telegraph carried a report on the film and its stills. One of them showed Netaji wearing a tie with a ?triangular? knot. I do not think such a knot was prevalent during Bose?s time. 

B.K. Roy Chowdhury, 

Asoke Road.

Apropos ?Cop crime, no punishment?, April 12, it is shocking that two minors were crushed to death under the wheels of a truck speeding to escape police extortion . Most policemen in the state are corrupt, but they are rarely punished. 

Prahlad Agarwala, 

Majdia, Nadia. 

The picture published with the report highlights how 

deep-rooted corruption is in our system. I wonder whether our honourable chief 

minister takes into account the extortionists in uniform while declaring West 

Bengal to be an ?oasis of peace?. 

Rajdeep Guha,

Gol Park. 

Police are the most organised criminals in India and 

a threat to democracy. 

Sachindra Nath Mitra, 

Beleghata.

Apropos the report ?Army flip-flop on Eden?, April 27, the army takes all action after due deliberation. It reiterated its position that if the state government wished to reinstate the entry fee of Rs 2 to Eden Gardens, it should approach the ministry of defence. Cars parked on the Maidan have destroyed its greenery. The suggestion was therefore made that parking fee of Rs 100 be considered to dissuade car-owners from parking on the Maidan. The police commissioner has confirmed to the GOC Bengal Area that he did not make any statement implying that the Army was not communicating properly with the state government. It is requested that before publishing any news item regarding the army, a clarification be obtained from HQ Bengal Area. I am disappointed that the efforts of the army for a better and greener Calcutta are being projected in such a poor light. You may like to correct the impression your readers may have drawn from such a news item. 

Major General Z.U. Shah,

GOC Bengal Area. 

Metro replies: Major General Shah has not contradicted 

the contents of the report; he has reiterated the points made in it. 

 We have stated that it was decided at the meeting that the chief secretary of the West Bengal government would write to the defence secretary for reinstatement of the Rs 2 entry fee for Eden Gardens. What we have additionally written is that Gen Shah said that he was not opposed to the entry fee. This has been corroborated by several of those who attended the meeting. 

 Gen Shah has not denied that that he suggested that the police charge a fee of Rs 100 per car for vehicles parked on the Maidan. He has simply explained his reasons for doing so: that cars parked on the Maidan destroy its greenery. 

 Nowhere in the report is there any suggestion to project the army?s efforts for a better and greener Calcutta in poor light. We are extremely happy about the army?s concern for the Maidan. The report substantially deals with differences between the army and the state government on the issue of the entry fee.

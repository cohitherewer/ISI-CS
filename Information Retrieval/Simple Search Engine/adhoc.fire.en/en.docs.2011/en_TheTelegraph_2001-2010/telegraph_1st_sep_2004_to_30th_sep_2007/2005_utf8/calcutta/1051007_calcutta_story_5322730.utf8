 Dandiya dwindles 

Stick dance on sticky wicket

 - Curfew orders at Cinderella hour key cause of dance blast downslide

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 The dandiya is dwindling. After sweeping the festive crowd off its feet for more than a few years, the twirl of the sticks and the swirl of the ghagras are slowing down dramatically.

 From close to 15 big dandiya shows last year, the count is down to half this time. From all-night Navratri blasts, the dandiya din could be decidedly low-decibel this Puja.

 The reasons range from the curfew clampdown at Cinderella hour, the accommodation bar, the demand for transparency?

 ?We see to it that the organisers adhere to the norms laid down by the high court. The regulations regarding decibel count, the capacity of the venue and the fire-fighting arrangements have to be followed strictly,? said a source in Lalbazar. 

 Even Payal, a big name in the dandiya circuit, has dropped out after 12 crowd-pulling years. ?All the permissions were acquired, the artistes were paid and the venue was booked. Then, we were told that we would have to reduce the number of days to six (from their customary nine nights) and that the timing should not stretch beyond midnight. This is not feasible, as we get maximum footfall after midnight,? said an official in the organisation.

 Similarly, popular dandiyas at Aquatica and Lake Land Country Club have also pulled out. But some event managers, responsible for pushing up the dandiya glamour count in town by bringing in celebrities from Mumbai, see the authorities? point of view.

 Among those pulling out is RGV Events.

 ?Dandiya is the most exciting thing happening at this time of the year, but the mammoth footfall creates problems,? says RGV spokesperson Gurpreet Kaur Sethi.

 Many event managers feel the administration cannot be blamed for making permissions mandatory, as some organisers lack transparency, continue their events past the deadline, let in more people than the venue can accommodate and do not make proper fire-fighting arrangements.

 ?Footfalls more than 30,000 sounds good, but is a logistical nightmare,? says Anil Bhutoria of The Stadel Hotel, which organised a dandiya at the helipad grounds of Salt Lake stadium last year, but has decided not to go in for an action replay.

 ?Anybody who pays a couple of hundred rupees can walk in and that creates trouble. I faced problems last year, so, if I organise another dandiya, I will be extra careful,? he adds.

 Then, there are those who blame it all on the cops. ?Last year, we got the nod just an hour before the dandiya started. This year, we are yet to get police permission. All the artistes, DJs and technicians have been paid. If I do not get the permission, I will suffer huge losses,? says an event manager who has been organising dandiyas for the past three years.

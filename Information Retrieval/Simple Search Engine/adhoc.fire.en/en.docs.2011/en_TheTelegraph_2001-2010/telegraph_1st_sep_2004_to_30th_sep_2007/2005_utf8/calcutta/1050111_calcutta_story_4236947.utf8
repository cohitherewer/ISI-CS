 Reverse painting Stories Retold by Nalini Malani, being exhibited at CIMA Gallery

 CIMA Gallery?s current exhibition, entitled Special Works, covers a whole range of artists, beginning with a master like Jamini Roy and ending with contemporary artists Anju Dodiya and Nalini Malani.

 To begin at the beginning, Jamini Roy?s gouache on board belongs to the period when he painted under the influence of the Post-Impressionists. It is easy to recall the great Europeans of that period in the neat row of trees.

 Tortured bodies and souls symbolised by the huge dark cavities that are their eyes, their mouths gaping in pain, are trapped within the confines of Somnath Hore?s colour etchings going back to the early 60s and in his attenuated sculptures. The titles of these prints, such as Fire Victims, Widows, The Cry and Massacre, are indicative of the excruciating experience of their lives.

 Jogen Chowdhury has executed a superb work with pen and ink and pastels on paper of the body of a dead man, its face and carcass distorted to the point of being a caricature. Only the gaping wounds are too real to have anything comical about them.

 Nalini Malani?s reverse painting, entitled Stories Retold, is large ? 155 cm by 100 cm. It is a colourful work and the fables are worked around a mythical fruit-bearing tree. 

 Anthropomorphic tigers, crocodile, hares, whale and other denizens of the animal world are in communication with women with amorphous bodies ? each suggestive of a fresh take on age-old stories, charmingly guileless, yet tantalising.

 In Circus Insomnia, Anju Dodiya uses acrylic on a shiny velvet mattress with tiger-skin print. She uses visual puzzles, such as the conjoined heads of clones, bodies in embrace juxtaposed with a lamb all depicted in black lines that at times merge with the tiger stripes in an obvious post-modern exercise. Its title, too, is so clever. 

 One of the few artists who takes obvious delight in unbridled eroticism, and is quite happy to depict priapism in man and animals, is Andhra-based Laxma Goud. A dryad emerges from a grove of ithyphallic trees. A woman, with her vulva clearly delineated, stands in front of a man in a dhoti. It is a fine and stimulating pencil drawing.

 Yogesh Rawal?s white-on-white etchings on zinc are meant to be minimalistic. But such a design is used too often. 

 Prabhakar Kolte plays with circles in two small acrylics on mount board. This artist always finds his own way of saying things. Shakila?s huge collage of Ganesh testifies to her mastery over the medium.

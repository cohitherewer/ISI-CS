 No way. Rather, the multiplexes are caught in a bind. Distributors are happier with us. Multiplexes charge 50 per cent of the sale as rent while single-screen theatres take 10 to 18 per cent, depending on the hall?s condition. For instance, in a multiplex, if sales are of Rs 10 lakh, distributors have to pay up Rs 5 lakh. For the same volume of sales, they will have to pay us barely Rs 1 lakh. So they take home much more. Because of their facilities, multiplexes charge exorbitantly. That way, their clientele is restricted to the upper class. Now, to woo the other classes they are reducing ticket prices. If they do that, distributors will hardly make much money. Also, if rickshawwallas start to walk in, will a corporate executive want to go to a multiplex?

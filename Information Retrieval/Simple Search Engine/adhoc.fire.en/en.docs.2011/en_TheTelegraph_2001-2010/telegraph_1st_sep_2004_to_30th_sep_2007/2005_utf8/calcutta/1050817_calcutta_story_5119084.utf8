 Beauty paegents are no longer restricted to young fashionistas alone. The PC Chandra Swarnapriya contest 2005, in association with Red FM at The Senator Hotel on August 13, saw six contestants from the corporate world, home front and college campus display glamour and poise in fair measure.

 The judges for the event were Jisshu Sengupta, Jimmy Tangree and U.K. Chandra, joint managing director of PC Chandra. The contest was based on a six-week activity between June 27 and August 7 aired during the radio programme Red Adda.

 Each day announced a winner, who were then interviewed to choose a weekly winner. The six weekly winners made it to the finals where they donned their dream attire with matching jewellery.

 Questions like how will you explain that jewellery is a symbol of strength for todays women? and what excuse would you give your husband for buying you a jewellery piece? were answered with aplomb.

 While all six finalists received gold earrings, PC Chandra Swarnopriya winner Navita Gupta was awarded a wedding collection worth Rs 30,000. It was real fun being here and all the contestants shared a very good rapport, said Navita. 

 DJ don

 He made Bollywood retro a rage with tracks like Keh doon tumhein, Main hoon don and Disco 82. Now he is back with his latest remix in Kajrare that is already topping the console charts.

 DJ Aqeel was in Tantra on Saturday night jamming and scratching like he does.

 People might have individual music preferences but when it comes to dancing in a disc, Hindi songs are the universal favourites. This, I say from my personal experience because I have played in every part of the country, said he, in between tracks.

 The DJ from Mumbai took control of the console after midnight and kept at it till 4 am. Besides his own remixes, the revelry repertoire included numbers like Boom boom, Aap jaisa koi meri zindagi mein aaye and Nach baliye.

 He is not only a master at what he does, he also interacts with the crowd by cracking jokes and talking about the latest craze in music, smiled a party animal.

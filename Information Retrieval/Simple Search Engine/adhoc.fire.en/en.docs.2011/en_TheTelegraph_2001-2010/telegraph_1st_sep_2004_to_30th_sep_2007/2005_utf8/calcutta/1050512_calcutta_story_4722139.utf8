 Time to step up for a refreshing terrace tea party. Camellia Tea Bar, that opened its fifth outlet on the first floor of The Samilton Hotel on Wednesday, offers a fresh rooftop hangout.

 Some revitalising Qahwa or Rose Petal Tea, or a cup of chilled Mango Cha or Litchi Tea along with Walnut Pastry and Baked Bean Sandwiches is the model fare on offer at the 37 Sarat Bose Road address.

 Camellia Tea Bar, a venture of Assam Tea Company, has other outlets in Saturday Club, Calcutta Swimming Club, CC amp;FC and Woodlands Medical Clinic.

 This is our first commercial venture. There is a need for more zones in the city where people can escape from all kinds of pollution. We decided upon a terrace tea bar because it gives the place a distinct identity, different from other coffee and tea bars. Though mostly youngsters are known to frequent tea bars, we are trying to make the ambience as versatile as possible here, said a spokesperson. 

 The menu is a mix of hot and cold tea, brownies, cookies, sandwiches, pizza and south Indian delights.

 Mango tango

 Mango is back to being the seasons favourite fruit and to herald its annual return, the coffee shop at The Oberoi Grand has whipped up a mango festival for the month of May. And its not just restricted to the dessert section but spills over to the starters and main course as well.

 One can start the mango feast with Smoked Chicken Breast and Mango Salad with garden greens and black olives. Moving on to the main course, one can opt for a fish, duck, pork or prawn preparation. The Pan-Fried Snapper Fillet with Mango Glaze, served with spicy rice noodles, and the Red-Legged Prawns on Garlic and Herb Spaghetti with grilled asparagus and mango chive cream sauce are delectable options for fish lovers. The Roast Peppered Duck Breast Slices and Confit of Leg with Thyme-Braised Mango is a must-try for those wanting a taste of duck. The Pork, Prune and Mango Ragout with pink pepper sage mash and candied garlic is another item on the list. 

 Mango is a fruit that takes on the flavour of meats very fast and vice versa. The result is a novel taste. And, May being the welcoming month for this fruit, we wanted a festival that highlights all the goodness of mangoes, said manager of the eatery, Nupur Chhibber. 

 The fruit finds more legitimate use in the dessert section with Mango Melba (chocolate cups filled with diced mango and home-made mango ice-cream with caramel sauce and almond nougat), Mango Club (rum-soaked sponge layers filled with mango jelly, fresh mango and ice-cream) or Mango Cheesecake. For those whod rather stick to more home-grown tastes there is Mango Kulfi and Mango Lassi. 

 Two people dropping by for a mango tango here will run an average bill of Rs 1,200.

 Summer gear

 Understated elegance has always been designer Sayon Mitras style and thats precisely the look that his spring summer 2005 line flaunts. Womens western wear has been his forte so long, but a first from the young designer this time is a line of mens shirts.

 I have been looking to debut in mens fashion for some time now. This summer I am launching a line of lounge wear shirts for men, reveals the designer. Structured shirts in mulmul and linen with hand-texturing, pleats, straight machine lines and herringbone stitches comprise the new line. The colours are vibrant ? yellow, red, rust and orange.

 The womens range is a more subtle affair with tone-on-tone threadwork adorning the neatly-cut western silhouettes like tops, shirts, trousers and skirts. Soft-flowing fabrics like chiffon, georgette, crepe, linen and the traditional Chanderi come in fresh summer hues like white, off-white, beige, pink, blue and green, and some brighter ones like red and rust.

 My collection for women this time is totally different from what I have done so far. Unlike my typical structured cuts, this line is made of more body-hugging flimsy fabrics, says Sayon.

 Both the collections start from Rs 3,000.

 Fill in 

 Its not quite how a croissant is shaped, but Criss Cross is a name that fits on the tongue easily. The croissants at the promotion so named at The Atrium Caf? in Park hotel melt in the mouth just as easily. 

 On till May 15, the menu is offering a wide array, which features square-shaped croissants along with the traditional crescent-shaped ones, perhaps to do more justice to the theme.

 Croissant, which is predominantly eaten for breakfast, has been transformed into a complete dish by itself suitable for lunch or dinner through the addition of sumptuous fillings, explained a spokesperson.

 One can dig into South Indian choices like Mutton Pepper Fry in Curry Leaf, Coconut Croissant and South Indian Potatoes in Chilli and Mustard Croissant. 

 Those opting for the richness of the North-West Frontier taste can try Shatoosh Chicken Tikka bits in Pistachio and Almond Croissant.

 If you like your croissant strictly Continental, there is Munich Sausage with Caramelised Onion in Butter Croissant, Fricassee of English Veggie in Butter Croissant and the like. 

 Italian croissant-pizzas like Mediterranean Grilled Vegetables and Mozzarella Croissant Pizza, a truly innovative inter-continental concept, combining the two all-time favourite breads of France and Italy with a filling inspired by the culinary dexterity of the Mediterranean region, provide more variety.

 For a taste of the Orient, the Seafood Thermidor in Rosemary and Garlic Croissant and Spicy Oriental Chicken Croissant are definitely worth a try.

 Finally, a croissant for sweet lovers ? the chefs speciality Hot Buttery Mangoes with Ice-cream in Ginger Almond Croissant.

 The fare is priced between Rs 135 and Rs 290. 

 New sparkle

 They count Maneka Gandhi, Yookta Mookhey and Nikita Anand among their old and new clients. Now the 80-year-old diamond store AP Jewellers has now shifted base to a more happening address of 21 Camac Street from its original station at 59 Muktaram Babu Street. 

 Apart from diamond jewellery, the store also caters to the demand of the moment, that of more versatile pieces studded with semi-precious stones. Be it violet amethysts, wine red rubies or green emeralds, one can find the preferred choice of stones mixed and matched with diamonds for an interesting effect. 

 The diamond has become an intrinsic part of the bridal trousseau and its elegance has replaced the chunky gold pieces of yesteryears. These precious gems have their own attitude and design philosophy, said a spokesperson.

 Proprietor Arun Poddars wife Meena and daughter Adhishri assist in the buying process with a personalised chat wherein the taste and budget of the client is taken into account. 

 So, if one cannot find the necklace of their dreams, one still has the option of getting it custom-made.

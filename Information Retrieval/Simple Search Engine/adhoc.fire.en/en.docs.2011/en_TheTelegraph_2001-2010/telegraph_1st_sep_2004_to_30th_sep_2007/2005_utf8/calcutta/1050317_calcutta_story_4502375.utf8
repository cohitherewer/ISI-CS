 Beans spilt by kidnap driver 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Mukesh Singh, an accused in the Roma Jhawar abduction case, told the Salt Lake sub-divisional judicial magistrate on Wednesday that he had witnessed mastermind Gunjan Ghosh murder Arvind Bhai, another abductor. 

 Singh, who dropped off Roma after the ransom was collected, said he had not tried to resist Gunjan out of fear.

 Singh claimed before magistrate Bipasha Mondal that he had no clue about what Gunjan and his gang were up to, till he saw the girl and later, witnessed the murder over sharing of the booty.

 ?I could make out that something was wrong but didn?t dare to speak out, since Gunjan and Pappu (another accused) were carrying arms. I had to follow their orders,? he reportedly told the court.

 Singh was hired by Gunjan to work as a driver. He reportedly added: ?While waiting outside a garage at Kadapara, I saw Gunjan bump off Arvind. He asked me to dump the body in a canal near Science City.?

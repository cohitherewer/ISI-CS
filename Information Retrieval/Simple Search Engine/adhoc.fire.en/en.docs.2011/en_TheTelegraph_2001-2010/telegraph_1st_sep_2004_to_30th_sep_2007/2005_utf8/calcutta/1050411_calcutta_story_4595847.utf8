The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Travelling bright

 Taj Mahal is under the scanner in BBC?s Fast Track

 The capital hosted one of the biggest international travel and tourism industry summits from April 8 to 10. The World Travel and Tourism Council?s (WTTC) sixth global summit had a series of sessions with CEOs of airlines, managing directors of the biggest travel agencies and tourism ministers. India beat China and the US to host the coveted event.

 Also on the menu was a focus on India as a tourist destination. Among the media showcasing the event and the host country was BBC World, which has two shows lined up for later this month. The first, to be broadcast at noon on April 17, is a summary of the summit. And on April 24, the show is on the Incredible India campaign run by the Indian tourism ministry, highlighting the country as a holiday hotspot.

 The two shows will be aired as part of the channel?s travel and tourism-industry-related programme Fast Track. The weekly worldwide round-up of travel news for both the leisure and business sectors is anchored by Akhtar Khan. In Delhi for three days, the correspondent wrapped up the two half-hour shows.

 ?The WTTC summit started on a very buoyant note, with the President of India?s speech. The focus for our show, apart from a summary of the various sessions and debates, will be the effect of the tsunami on the tourism industry,? Khan told Metro. ?But we will also look at how such a global summit will impact India.?

 The second show takes a look at efforts to sell India as a tourist destination. ?We would have done a show on the country anyway, but the timing of the campaign was perfect. Apart from an interview with tourism minister Renuka Chowdhury, we will highlight certain aspects, like how states within India are promoting themselves. In that context, we will focus on Rajasthan and its heritage as an attraction,? explained Khan.

 The programme will also shed light on the progress of medical tourism in India. On a lighter note, one segment will look at the age of the Taj Mahal. ?It is the 350th anniversary, but how old is it really?? he wondered. ?People are still fascinated by the monument.?

 Khan added that India was increasingly gaining popularity internationally as a tourist destination. ?At international fairs and travel marts, India usually has huge stalls with lots of visitors. I?m from Hyderabad myself, which had a wonderful stand at the World Travel Mart in London. People want an exotic, refreshing, peaceful and calm destination for their holidays. And India offers all that, as well as lots of colour and culture,? Khan signed off.

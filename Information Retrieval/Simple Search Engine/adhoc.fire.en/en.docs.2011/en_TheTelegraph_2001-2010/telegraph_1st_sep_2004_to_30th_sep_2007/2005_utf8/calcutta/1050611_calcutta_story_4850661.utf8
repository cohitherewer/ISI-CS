The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Some operators of the new Euro-II compliant buses have rearranged the seats to earn more revenue by carrying vendors? luggage. To free up space behind the driver?s seat, the leg room between the other seats on the row has been reduced, causing great discomfort to passengers. Also, in some buses, boxes have been constructed underneath the seats, making it impossible for passengers to stretch their legs. The problems are most common in buses plying from Howrah to Lake Town and Salt Lake. The transport department should immediately investigate the matter and take steps against the guilty operators.

 While taking the Steel Express to Howrah from Tatanagar on May 25, I was pleasantly surprised to hear an announcement that the first four compartments of the train had been reserved for those holding passes and season tickets. The railway authorities deserve accolades for the novel and helpful initiative. I hope the system is introduced in other trains as well.

 A relative recently withdrew Rs 5,000 in cash from a nationalised bank. The bank paid him the amount in Rs 500 notes. Later, when he tried to use the notes at a city nursing home, he was shocked to hear that one of the notes was fake. My relative immediately returned to the bank and showed the note to the cashier who had serviced him. The cashier inspected the note and agreed that it was a fake but denied giving it to my relative. To avoid such incidents, all banks should have a a machine which the customers can use to test whether the notes they have been handed over are fake or not.

 During a recent visit to the Indian Museum, I was shocked to see that names have been inscribed on the fossils of animals.What is surprising is that nothing was done to remove the traces of vandalism. We are living in an age when such incidents can be prevented with the help of the surveillance equipment. The museum authorities, however, do not seem to care.

 Ajit Pandey,

 Belur. 

 It is sad that in this era of globalisation, our passport department works at a snail?s pace. On inquiry, I was told that a minimum of three months is required to obtain a passport. It will be of great help to those who have to go abroad at a short notice if the department picks up pace. 

 Rabindra Nath Kar,

 Sankar Ghosh Lane.

 Woofers, digital amplifiers, mp3 players, VCD and DVD systems, touchscreen television? Not for the home, but in-car audio and video systems for the complete entertainment experience. Thats what Wheels, on Purna Das Road, offers.

 The south Calcutta shop has been around for seven years, slowly but steadily gaining ground among the citys car and electronics connoisseurs. And after a revamp and expansion, theres now a second floor with a display area in a total of 500 sq ft.

 A premium dealer for German company Blaupunkt and a preferred dealer for Sony systems, proprietor Anand Bhawnani is on the fast track to growth. The market is good for expensive car accessories in Calcutta. People like this stuff. I sell about 100 pieces a month, he said at the inauguration of the new-look outlet on Sunday.

 And what he offers doesnt come cheap. The recently-launched Rs 1.25 lakh digital video system, with in-car video, digital amplifiers and central speakers, has already sold six pieces. Seven of the Rs 25,990 woofer speakers have been sold, as have Rs 37,990 amplifiers (Rs 75,000 a pair). 

 But 93 per cent of my sales is mp3 players. People usually come back to upgrade and add more. For instance, theyll buy the VCD system, and then the speakers, amplifiers and monitors (headrest ones for the back seat and rooftop for the front). The next thing were going to release is the touchscreen monitor, added Bhawnani. 

 The facelift of the store was done to cater to the upmarket lifestyles in todays fast-changing society. And even in Calcutta, theres plenty of demand. Bhawnani explained that while Delhis grey market makes it too dubious to calculate, Calcutta is just after Bangalore and Mumbai in Blaupunkts India sales. 

 An in-car electronics extravaganza is not the only luxury accessory that Wheels offers. It redesigns the interiors of cars to suit individual taste (people like a lot of colour). The leather that adorns the inside is sourced from Stanley, the same in the hot wheels of celebrities like Amitabh Bachchan, Sachin Tendulkar, Dilip Chhabria and Vijay Mallya.

 One wall on the ground floor of the store is a collage of around 50 images of Bhawnanis design work, which come at Rs 16,000 onwards for imitation leather (also by Stanley) and Rs 30,000 and above for the genuine article. The designs are taken from international catalogues that are imported. Another service offered is engine modification.

 Picking up pace are car safety and theft-stopping measures. The central door locking system is among the fastest-selling items.

 A new product is the camera and screen safety set for reverse gear at Rs 30,000. The tiny camera is attached to the back of the car, which is automatically activated when in reverse gear. The two-inch screen is fixed to the rear-view mirror, so the driver doesnt have to turn 180 degrees to catch a glimpse of the rear end. The in-car video entertainment systems are mostly bought by big cars (SUVs), because people use them to go on long drives. We re-do the interiors for all types of cars. For smaller cars, especially second-hand ones, people are really willing to spend on upgrade, said the 25-year-old.

 Bhawnani is sure of success in the Calcutta market: People want this stuff. All you have to do is tell them its available.

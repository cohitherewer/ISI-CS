 You share your birthday with...

 Asha Bhonsle 

You are among those who are useful to everyone at all times. You are the most satisfied when deep in work, and using all the skills you have. Your tact and diplomacy are so good that even competitors admire you. You have a youthful curiosity, which enables you to enjoy everyone?s company, regardless of age or class. Outdoors appeal to your senses and help you relax.? Kusum Bhandari

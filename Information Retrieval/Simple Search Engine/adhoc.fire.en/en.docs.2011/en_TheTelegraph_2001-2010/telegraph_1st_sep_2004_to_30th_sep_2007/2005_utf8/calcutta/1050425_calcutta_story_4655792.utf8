 Shabd charade

 Zayed Khan boogeying the night away at Fusion.

He may not be on the Bollywood hit-list, but Zayed Khan isn?t short on shabd. On a whirlwind breeze through the city on Saturday night for a jig at Fusion, he would have done the bigger Khans proud when it came to letting his tongue loose on a rip-roaring rampage. With three flops (and counting?) and just a Shah Rukh-doctored hit, Zayed, whose greatest claim to fame is the boogie-woogie in DJ Aqeel?s Disco 82, was into sonorous soliloquies on ?pseudo intellectual pursuit of scripts? and ?greater good of capitalist market and society?.

 But Zayed does regret the failure of Shabd, which was billed as his big ticket to Bollywood?s senior league. ?Some films are done for the heart and some are done for the stomach. I did Shabd for the heart and the commercial success of the film was not there on my mind. Sometimes actors do some movies that they truly believe in without understanding what lies between fact and fiction.?

 Then comes the candid confession: ?I do feel bad that even after juicing the orange, I couldn?t connect with the audience. We were tackling such a complex subject and I still honestly feel that Shabd was ahead of its times. But then again, that?s an actor?s version and the failure of the film is something to seriously ponder on.?

 And so now, Zayed?s matured ? in picking movies. He is doing three multistarrers so that he wouldn?t have to bear the brutal brunt if the films bite the dust again. ?I know that failing actors do multistarrers and growing actors are into single-starrers. But you also have to look into the feasibility of the economics of the film industry. You have to completely understand who you are and the kind of market you are catering to. You have to adapt to the changing business environment. Either you are savvy or you are obsolete,? he argued.

 The enlightened Zayed, who debuted in Sangeeth Sivan?s solo-hero film Chura Liya Hai Tumne, doesn?t mind sharing the spotlight anymore. ?If the script and character excite me then the multistarrer aspect doesn?t play too much on my mind. And if the idea is executed well, it?s a favour well done. If a single-hero film happens, it will surely come my way. In fact, there are talks of a one-hero film named Idiot,? revealed Zayed.

 But up next is the Nitin Manmohan-produced Anubhav Sinha?s Dus, which has half of Bollywood in the star cast including Zayed. ?It will be our way of answering to Mission Impossible 2. It is a very entertaining action-oriented film, the kind of cinema you would go out to see in a summer vacation.?

 And there?s David Dhawan?s Shaadi No. 1 and Sohail Khan?s Fight Club, directed by Vicky Chopra. ?Shaadi No. 1 is fun to the core, really insane comedy which will have the audiences pulling their hair out at the end of it all. Fight Club is a youth-oriented cool action flick about teenage relationships, deceit and betrayal.?

 Before leaving his hotel room and joining a packed Fusion floor and dancing away till late in the night, Zayed did go off the filmi track for a moment. ?Just like my character in Shabd who fell for someone who?s older in age, I also don?t believe in the age factor. With the kind of fathers Fardeen and I have, age is just a number to us. And love is such an unconditional thing that there can be no barriers whatsoever.?

 Is anybody listening out there?

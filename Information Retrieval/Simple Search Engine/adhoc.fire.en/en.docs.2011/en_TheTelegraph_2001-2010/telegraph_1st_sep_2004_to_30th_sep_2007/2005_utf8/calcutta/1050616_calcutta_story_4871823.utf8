The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Malaysia?s three-prong tourism bait 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The number of Indian tourists to Malaysia in 2004 rose by 20 per cent. In the first four months of 2005 alone, the figure jumped by a ?remarkable? 20 per cent. And that?s before the count for the peak period (May to June) is in. 

 The expectations are a growth of around 18 per cent this year, to 200,000 Indian arrivals. With 64,000 already accounted for, the going looks good and the target is set to be crossed, according to officials. 

 To entice travellers, a new deal is on offer from Malaysia Tourism Board, starting July, with Singapore Tourism Board and Star Cruise.

 The 6-sixer offer, valid till September, is a land-and-cruise package for Rs 16,999. The seven-day-six-night trip includes two nights in Kuala Lumpur, two nights on Star Cruise and two nights in Singapore. Applicable only on Star Cruise SuperStar Virgo, it provides accommodation on a twin-sharing basis with breakfast, half-day city tours in both Kuala Lumpur and Singapore and airport transfers.

 The ?first-ever? joint initiative of two national tourist organisations and a cruise company to develop and attract potential travellers to the region is targeted at holidaymakers, as well as the meetings-incentives-conventions-exhibitions (MICE) segment. 

 ?July to September is the season when the Indian MICE category moves abroad. So, we are promoting this package as part of our corporate campaign,? says Bhupesh Kumar, marketing manager, Malaysia Tourism Promotion Board. 

 ?Most firms nowadays offer incentives like holidays to their employees after a convention, so it should go down well,? he explained.

 To facilitate tourist travel, a visa collection centre has been opened in Calcutta from June 6. 

 ETA Travel Agency, the general sales agency for Malaysia Airlines, has been granted permission by the consulate-general of Malaysia in Chennai for online submission of tourist visa applications.

 The centre, on the fourth floor of Chowringhee Court, is open 10 am to 1 pm. The papers will be processed in Chennai in three working days.

 Since the launch of Malaysia Airlines direct flights from Calcutta to Kuala Lumpur, the volume of Calcutta tourists to the region has picked up. Holiday package deals like the 6-sixer are aimed at increasing the numbers. This promotion is available from Star Cruise private sales agents.

 A bonus for travellers during this period is the annual mega sale carnival from July till September, the Colours of Malaysia festival and the Food and Fruits Fiesta.

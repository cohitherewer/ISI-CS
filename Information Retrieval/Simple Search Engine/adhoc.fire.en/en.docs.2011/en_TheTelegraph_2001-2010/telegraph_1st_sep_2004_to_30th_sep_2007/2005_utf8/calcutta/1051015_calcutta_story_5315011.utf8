 There lies the substance...

 bard beckons: Kevin Spacey 

 nWhat was the first Shakespeare play you ever saw? What do you remember about it?

 It was a high-school production of Othello. In retrospect, I realise the impact it had on me, to watch a group of 17 and 18-year-olds performing a Shakespeare play. 

 Every day in rehearsal was like a Shakespeare masterclass. It made me want to play Iago, which I did a few years later. Pretty soon after that I began my first high-school Shakespeare class, so I was introduced to his writing fairly early, though maybe not as early as British students are, and I guess I fell in love with his work then. I remember I bought myself The Riverside Shakespeare which is a great examination of his work, with incredible photographs and illustrations, and examinations of the plays. In fact I still have that edition to this day.

 nWhich is your favourite Shakespeare play?

 I don?t have a single answer to that one. One can see a production that you thought you knew, and rediscover it, and it can suddenly go to the top of your list. So first I?d have to claim split loyalties. 

 Having said that, I would pick out Henry V. It?s a powerful play with extraordinary roles and examines both the futility and the camaraderie of war. I?ve seen many productions of it. One of the great strengths of Shakespeare?s writing is that you can see different kinds of productions, different interpretations, different attacks on a play and, whether they work or not, the plays survive. The plays are in that sense elastic, no one really knows what Shakespeare?s intentions were and the writing comes through almost any interpretation.

 nWhich is your least favourite Shakespeare play? Why?

 This is not a question I can answer. Even if there are plays I know less well, or don?t connect with as well as others, I wouldn?t say I dislike them. I really like Love?s Labour?s Lost, for example, a play a lot of people have trouble with, but I think it?s a beautiful play.

 nEveryone thought you were going to play Richard III. Why did you choose Richard II?

 It wasn?t a play I knew well at the outset ? it?s not produced as often as some of Shakespeare?s more famous plays. I guess one of the first motivations for me was the discovery that Trevor Nunn had never directed Richard II. I found that a very compelling argument for doing it because it meant that we?d have an opportunity to discover the play together.

 I enjoy the excitement of the unexpected and the challenge of doing something that audiences might not think is the obvious choice. It?s a play that has real resonance today, with its examination of the corridors of power, the struggle for supremacy between rival leaders, the rituals of pomp and ceremony, the meaning of monarchy. 

 What?s interesting about the play, and I hope about this production, is that the audience?s sympathies will shift throughout the evening between Richard and Bolingbroke.

 nWhat?s your favourite line in the play and why?

 My favourite line is ?There lies the substance?. The play encompasses two spheres of experience. From the beginning of the play until that line we?re very much seeing the external view of Richard. From that line forward the play shifts to examine his internal experience, so it is a key moment when Richard realises that the place he needs to go to, to explore, the place from where his life flows, is inside himself.

 nYou are working with the legendary Trevor Nunn. Please describe him.

 Encouraging, funny and exclusively denim. But of course that doesn?t do him justice. He is the kind of director who not only is remarkably supportive, but his ideas and suggestions are spot-on and very specific, and always seem to come at exactly the moment I?m ready to hear them. 

 He has been remarkably attentive to the process that I?ve been going through with respect to tackling the language, to understanding the double and sometimes triple aspects of Richard?s character, the conflicts that he experiences and the nature of his personality. It has been a truly rewarding time, and also to be part of an extraordinary company of actors, many of whom have great experience of Shakespeare, and who have been immensely generous to me.

 nWhat is your favourite American Shakespeare performance?

 In a way my choice illustrates the elasticity I mentioned earlier. Probably one of the greatest Shakespearean performances I ever saw was when an actress called Diane Venora, who movie audiences may know from her role as Al Pacino?s wife in Heat, played Hamlet in Joseph Papp?s production at the New York Shakespeare Festival. It was a remarkable piece of work.

 nApart from the accent, do you have to think about acting Shakespeare differently from O?Neill or Miller?

 No, the language is a technical exercise, you have to fulfil the requirements of any role and in this case of course I?m playing an English king. But the internal life, the emotional connection that you want to achieve with a character, that doesn?t differ from writer to writer.

 You have to be aligned with a character?s experience. If the emotional life is there, and if it is true and rich, and if the internal motivations and contradictions are alive, then the journey is the same, whatever the play or whoever the writer is.

 nWhat?s the best production of a Shakespeare play you?ve ever seen?

 Hands down, Mark Rylance?s production of Twelfth Night at the Globe. An example, as they did of course in Shakespeare?s time, of men playing all the parts. Mark?s production, and his performance as Olivia, was one of the greatest, funniest, most illuminating productions not only of that play, but of any Shakespeare play that I have ever witnessed. It was a piece of genius and wonderful that so many people had the opportunity to see it. 

 nWhich is the character in Shakespeare that you would most like to play but hope you never will?

 The Fool in King Lear.

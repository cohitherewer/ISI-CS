 Forgers in rail dragnet

 PRASUN BHATTACHARYA

 The police have kicked off a drive to bust a racket of railway ticket forgers. The group is reportedly out to take advantage of the Puja passenger rush.

 The Howrah GRP is finalising the details of the raids to be conducted by a special team. Nineteen people were arrested in Howrah station on Monday night for travelling with forged tickets. 

 An RPF officer said they had accosted a group of 22 at the new complex of the station. ?Three of them fled. The rest were caught and 25 forged tickets were recovered from their possession,? the officer added. They were later handed over to the GRP.

 The forgery bore hallmarks of professionals. ?The old yellow, cardboard tickets were kept in water for some time, before the engraved dates were rubbed off and new dates typed in with a conventional typewriter. It took a lot of time to detect the forgery. An inexperienced ticket examiner could easily have been duped,? the RPF officer said.

 ?We have launched an investigation,? stated J.R. Bhagat, additional director-general, railway police. ?Interrogation of the group has confirmed that they have links with a large, organised racket. We suspect that the racket is based in Burdwan,? said a Howrah GRP officer.

 He added: ?We are planning to send a special team to Burdwan to blow the cover off the racket. We are yet to draw up the final action plan of the raids. Interrogation of the group members is still on. We must find out more details before we send our team.?

 According to railway officials, with the increase in passenger rush during the Puja, criminal activities in the stations also go up. The number of touts and ticket forgers also increase. ?The Puja is a menace for us,? commented a GRP official.

 ?Our passenger count increases by 30 per cent during the Puja. This year, we are running 128 special trains to tackle the rush,? a South Eastern Railway official stated.

 An officer of Eastern Railway said: ?We will carry 140,000 extra people during the Puja month. More than 100 special trains will be pressed into service.?

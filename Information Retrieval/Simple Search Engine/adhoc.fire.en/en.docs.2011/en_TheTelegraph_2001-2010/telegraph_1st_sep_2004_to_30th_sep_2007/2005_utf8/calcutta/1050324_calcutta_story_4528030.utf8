 Crossover choreography

 Continuing its creative experiments with literary and artistic forms and techniques, Ranan presents Crossings: exploring the facets of Lady Macbeth, which brings together the languages of dance and text-based drama. Exploring the several facets of Shakespeare?s Lady Macbeth with interesting parallels drawn to other woman figures of Indian mythology like Putana and Kali, Crossings examines the conflicting traits in Lady Macbeth?s character with a view to understanding the motives of a woman, often misjudged in interpretation. Analysing the meanings of femininity and being ?de-feminised? within the boundaries of her personality, the production skillfully transcends the borders between crossings that exist between and within people, concepts of gender and identity, and of communication through words and gestures, both in the content and style of its presentation. Performed by exponents of Indian classical dance and music, as well as folk artistes and actors, the production weaves together four strands of narrative (verbal, visual, musical and symbolic) into a beautifully choreographed item. Concept and direction: Vikram Iyengar.

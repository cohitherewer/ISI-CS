 Corporeal art

 A uniquely daring artist who specialises in the aesthetic representation of human forms, Papia Ghoshal comes across as a modern revivalist who triumphantly carries forward the illustrious tradition of the Renaissance masters. Forbidden Dreams, the ongoing exhibition of her paintings, appears as a series of observations of the human body, exploring its sexual grace, strength and sadness. Though pursuing the Western tradition of Michelangelo, Leonardo Da Vinci and Raphael, her nude studies present a surprisingly fresh view of masculinity. Ghoshal?s structural visualisations of the female form depend on more than spatial dimension and proportion to create in them an aura of power, vitality and spirituality. The sheer intensity of insight that she puts into developing her characters makes one certain that she paints not just what she sees but what she feels of the human body. Nevertheless, the strange, almost magical, transformation of her human forms goes beyond anthropology to enter the realm of poetic metamorphosis.

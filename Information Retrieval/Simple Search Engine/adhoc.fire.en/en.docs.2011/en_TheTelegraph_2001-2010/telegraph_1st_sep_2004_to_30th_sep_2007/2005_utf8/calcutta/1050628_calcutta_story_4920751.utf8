 Metal mayhem in interiors

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 According to Feng Shui, a metal framed bed amplifies electro-magnetic radiation flowing from electrical equipment present in a room. Hence, it is advisable to have 

 wooden beds as 

 these are more comforting and induce sound sleep

Q: My son (DOB 25.04.71) will be getting married later this year. We are planning to do up the interiors of his bedroom. He is insisting on having metal furniture, but we are not sure whether that will be beneficial for him. Can you please look into his birth chart and guide us regarding this? Also, please suggest a colour scheme for his room.

 The Solution: According to his pillars of destiny, he is a very strong metal person and needs to be balanced by water and wood elements. Metal elements should be strictly avoided in his immediate environment. Otherwise it will aggravate the already existing excessive metal element in his body. Moreover, metal-framed beds amplify the electromagnetic radiation flowing from electrical equipment present in the room. On the other hand, wooden beds are more comforting and help to induce sound sleep. Surround him with a blend of blue and green colours, which can be introduced in the form of curtains, furnishings, linen, bedspreads, rugs or carpets, flowers and decorative objects.

 Q: I recently got married to a man seven years older to me. He is dedicated to his religious guru to such an extent that he meditates for two hours every morning and evening. This definitely makes him a mentally well-balanced person, but I feel I need more attention, time and love from him. Our room has his gurus pictures on every wall. Can you please suggest changes in the room d?cor that can bring about marital happiness?

 The Solution: According to Feng Shui, each room of the house has its own energy. For example, the temple has its pious energy that cannot be mixed with the materialistic energy of a bedroom. You can definitely have pictures of a god or a religious guru in the room to give you mental strength and support, but they should not be so prominent that they start giving the effect and vibrations of a temple or a meditation chamber. In a master bedroom, pictures of your marriage or vacations spent together should be prominently displayed in the south-west, which is the love corner, along with objects that symbolise unity. These can be anything in pairs like birds or ducks or simply small crystal vases or bowls filled with semiprecious stones. Do not ignore your husbands sentiments and, with mutual agreement, shift his gurus pictures to the north-west wall, which is associated with mentors.

 Q: I have a large cabin in the south-west part of my office where I sit in the centre with my back to the south wall. On my left is my personal toilet. On my right, in the south-east corner, is my safe that contains all my important asset documents and cash. The entry to my chamber is from the north of the north-east corner. My business is doing quite well, but the performance is inconsistent. At times I feel like closing it down completely. Is anything wrong with my sitting arrangement?

 The Solution: Placing the table in the centre of an office is called a floating arrangement. It is very similar to a boat rocking in the middle of an ocean. To get stability in business, one must sit in the south-west corner where one side of the table touches solid wall. In your case, the toilet door that cuts through your table is also acting as a negative feature. To remedy this you can place a tall screen at a distance from the toilet door and attach one side of the table to this. Secondly, your safe is facing the entrance door, which is a sure sign of money being drained. You can shift it to the south-west corner close to you, where the ruling earth energy will help to stabilise your financial condition. 

 Q: We got our lobby painted in shades of red recently. This is the place where the whole family spends maximum time together. The new colour has definitely brought a lot of liveliness and vibrancy in the house, but has led to everybodys temper rising sharply. Is the colour of the lobby the cause of all the arguments in the family? 

 Yasmin

 The Solution: Excess fire energy created in your house by painting the lobby red could be provoking heated exchanges in the family. Red belongs to the fire element, which is directly associated with heat that gives it an explosive quality. Excess fire energy can be cooled down by hanging a large mirror with a black frame on one of the walls. Mirrors represent water element and hence are powerful in controlling uncontrollable fire energy. You can also weaken its effect in a subtle way by exhausting it with earth energy. Introducing earthen artefacts and adding furnishings in shades of beige, cream, yellow and rust should help.

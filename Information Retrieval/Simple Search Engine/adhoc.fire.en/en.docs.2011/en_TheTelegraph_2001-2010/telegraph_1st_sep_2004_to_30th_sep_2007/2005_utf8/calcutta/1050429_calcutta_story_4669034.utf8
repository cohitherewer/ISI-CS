 The Birla Industrial and Technological Museum (BITM) has launched a survey, Impact Assessment, to gauge the level of understanding of science subjects among schoolchildren.

 Students, when they visit the museum or take part in various scientific programmes, will be asked questions on scientific theories and their varied applications. 

 Around 80,000 students from schools in the city and its adjoining areas visit the museum annually.

 The BITM move is based on deliberations at the recently-concluded Congress of Science Museums in Rio de Janerio.

 ?Our project aims at gauging the extent to which students imbibe scientific phenomena when they visit the museum and check out the exhibits. The feedback on their understanding of natural phenomena through scientific models and audio-visual interactions will be used for our assessment,? said museum director Jayanta Sthanapati.

 ?Most schools emphasise on theories, ignoring practical demonstrations. This leaves doubts in the minds of the students, that can only be cleared by real experiences,? he added.

 The survey, which started recently, involves student visitors answering a questionnaire framed by a team of experts. ?Here, the students can actually see the phenomenon being demonstrated through the models,? an education officer told Metro.

 The students will be asked to identify machine parts, like steam engine pistons, that they had earlier seen only in textbooks. They will also be asked to identify the scientific theory at work behind the demonstration. 

 Over the next year, all students visiting the museum will be handed the questionnaire, prepared in consultation with psychologists.

 ?Teachers will be asked a different set of questions, so that we also get their feedback. This will help bridge the gap of understanding between the students and teachers,? director Sthanapati added.

 Apart from the students, the museum records an annual footfall of nearly 1.2 lakh, comprising teachers and guardians. The assessment of the students? ability to comprehend science will also provide the young learners with an opportunity to plan their academic pursuit.

 For the museum, the survey will result in a wealth of information, which will be used to devise more models and exhibits.

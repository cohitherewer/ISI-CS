The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Free a crook, face flak

 - CPM frowns at ?irresponsible? siege by women?s wing

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A day after some members of the Ganatantrik Mahila Samity laid siege on Jadavpur police station and freed a crook from custody, CPM leaders on Tuesday took strong exception to the manner in which its women?s wing had ?overstepped? the limits.

 About 400 women and men on Monday stormed the police station, led by Swapna Basu, a key Samity member, and freed Bapi Dutta from custody.

 Bapi had been picked by police from his Ibrahimpur Road residence, in Jadavpur, late on Sunday for allegedly duping Shankar Prasad Baidya, an automobile dealer, at Baruipur, on the southern fringes of the city.

 Baidya initially lodged a complaint with Baruipur police station against the accused and his stepmother, Subrota Mukherjee, for cheating him of about Rs 1 lakh.

 Subsequently, he lodged a complaint against the duo with Jadavpur police station. Though Bapi was rounded up, his stepmother could not be traced till Tuesday.

 ?We are against interfering with the job of police. They should be allowed to function independently,? Shantimoy Bhattacharya, CPM secretary of South 24-Parganas, said about Monday?s incident.

 Anubhav Guha, secretary of the Naktala unit of Calcutta Nagarik Sammelan, also backed by the CPM, said it was ?unfair? for anybody to intervene in police work.

 ?We may have reservations about police action, but at the same time we must not stop them from functioning independently,? he added.

 Guha said he would ask Pranab Roy, secretary of the 96 ward committee, to find out the details of Monday?s incident from Swapna Basu.

 Other members of the Naktala unit, too, raised their voices against Monday?s ?irresponsible action?. ?It is unbecoming of members of the Mahila Samity to behave in such an irresponsible manner. This will definitely send a wrong signal about our activities to the people,? said a senior member, preferring anonymity.

 The police officer of Jadavpur thana, from whose custody the youth was freed on Monday, has been asked to submit a detailed report on the incident.

 District superintendent of police of South 24-Parganas S.N. Gupta said he was awaiting a report from the officer concerned. ?How could such a thing happen at a police station?? he wondered.

 Complainant Baidya, who was asked to come to Baruipur police station on Tuesday to meet Kankar Prasad Barui, sub-divisional police officer, returned home disheartened after a wait of six hours.

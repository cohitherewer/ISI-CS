 Crisis cry over cooking gas

 - Supply chain dry, oil firms rule out normalcy before February

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Check your stock of cooking gas before you throw a New Year party at home.

 The crisis in the supply of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinders, which broke out in September, will continue for another two months.

 Consumers are being made to wait about a month to get a cylinder. Dealers are not registering bookings within 21 days of the supply of a cylinder and are taking another 10 days to supply a refill.

 Officials of oil companies, even while claiming that LPG supply has improved, ruled out normalcy before February. 

 Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), which coordinates with four oil companies, attributes the crisis to irregular supply of cooking gas from refineries. 

 ?The LPG for the city and its surrounding areas comes from refineries in Haldia and Jamnagar. Some amount is also imported from Malaysia,? IOC deputy general manager A.C. De said on Friday. ?The supply from Jamnagar has dried up since the closure of the refinery, but we are trying to meet the demand by importing more gas. Once the refinery restarts operation, the crisis will end.?

 According to IOC officials, there are around 2.7 million LPG consumers in the city. Around half the requirement of cooking gas comes from Jamnagar, 30 per cent from Haldia and the rest from abroad.

 ?We need 25 truckloads of cylinders every month, but are getting only around 15. There is no alternative to delaying supply. Consumers are directing their ire at us but our hands are tied,? said Kushal Ghosh, an LPG dealer in Survey Park, in south Calcutta. ?Earlier, the oil companies would push us for increasing the sale. Now, they are effectively curbing it.?

 Dealers in Salt Lake, Lake Town, Baguiati, Jadavpur, Behala and other areas voiced much the same grievance. ?Unless normal supply is restored, we cannot promise timely delivery,? they said, almost in unison.

 And taking full advantage of the crisis, a section of dealers is selling cylinders at a premium. While a bona fide customer has to wait for weeks for a refill, blackmarketeers are ensuring prompt delivery at Rs 500-700 a cylinder (the actual price is Rs 300).

 Alarmed at the wanton diversion of cooking gas, oil companies met police brass last week to prepare an action plan. 

 ?We know a large quantity of cooking gas is being diverted to garages, restaurants and road-side eateries. We have sought police help to track down the culprits. The enforcement branch has assured us of cooperation,? said an IOC official.

 A few days ago, members of the Ganatantrik Nagarik Samity organised a demonstration in Howrah to protest blackmarketing of cylinders.

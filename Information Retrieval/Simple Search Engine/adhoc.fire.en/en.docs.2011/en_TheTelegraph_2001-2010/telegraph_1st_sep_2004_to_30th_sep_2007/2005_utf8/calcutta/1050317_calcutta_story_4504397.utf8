In ?That?s just the way it is? (February 20), Shiloo 

Chattopadhyay has raised an interesting question: ?Can a self-selecting sample 

be representative of public opinion?? and in his opinion, ?True public opinion 

can only be gauged by knowing the views of every member of the public?. 

 The very existence of a democracy depends on free and fair election. However, voting is voluntary. Those who reach the polling booth comprise a ?self-selecting sample? out of the electorate. When the size of this sample is large enough, it reflects the opinion of that population. It does not mean that those who vote, do that only out of ?extreme emotions?. In fact, most do it from a sense of duty. When we express our opinion, it is always a mixture of logic and emotion. Sometimes, however we vote (or do not vote) out of compulsion. By and large these are small exceptions. Similarly, it is incorrect to say that those who do not vote ?are happy criticising the system?. The reasons can be many, such as absence, sickness or laziness. 

 In the case of Indian Idol, the method was televoting, limiting the population to those with access to phones. On different dates the votes registered varied between 15 lakh and 35 lakh. There are about 10 crore phones in India. But a substantial number are in workplaces, which were closed when this voting took place. Therefore, the sample size was significant and hence, represented the opinion of people using phones. 

 I observed an interesting phenomenon over a contestant from Punjab. The juries were not very impressed with him, but the public was. Here emotion reigned over logic, when the public gave weightage to his humble background. Eventually, however he was eliminated. The public has an uncanny ability to see through a maze. 

 Chattopadhyay writes, ?what if you find it too expensive to make long-distance call from the landline?? When one dials the televoting number from the landline telephone of BSNL or MTNL, only a unit of call is charged. This is a new service from BSNL.

 The fall guys: A tree being chopped down 

on the streetside 

I was sorry to read the report ?91 trees face axe to make a wider road?, February 18. Thanks to the media, it is well known that coastal areas with trees in Tamil Nadu were spared during the tsunami, but we refuse to learn from experience. Though tsunami is unlikely to strike Calcutta, the trees marked for slaughter render valuable services. In the US, under similar circumstances, the trees would be uprooted and transplanted elsewhere. All efforts must be made to save greenery. 

C.V.K. Moorthy,

Alipore. 

I am astonished to see people objecting to the felling 

of trees. Can a narrow road be widened without cutting the trees on its sides? 

I am a resident of Budge Budge and I feel the road should have been widened earlier. 

Without proper infrastructure, how can we have development? And a few trees should 

surely not come in the way. 

M. Venugopalan, 

Budge Budge.

Apropos the report ?Safety drill, deadly roads?, February 18, mishaps are natural on city roads, but accidents due to the apathy of the administration are hard to accept. The government has no right to take road tax and levy a cess on petrol and diesel. Mere penalising of jaywalkers and errant drivers are not enough. Among other things, footpaths need to cleared of encroachments. 

Subhankar Mukherjee, 

Borehat. 

Apropos the report ?Pilots back at work on court prod?, February 19, it is sad to see that the pilots have no concern for the people they fly. Do they think that they are above the law of the land? The government should take a tough stand against the guilty pilots. 

Biman Saha,

Lake Town. 

Apropos the report ?Mother faces defence barrage?, February 22, as the public prosecutor in the Rajnish Patel case has pointed out, documents pertaining to medical treatment should be handed over to the patient?s relatives. Section 1.3 of the Code of Ethics Regulations at the Medical Council of India mandates that doctors/hospitals have to maintain the medical records of a patient for at least three years and the documents have to be handed over within 72 hours if requested by the patient or his legally-authorised attendants. Why should a court order be needed for this?

The report ?Chided teen hangs herself?, February 23, highlights an alarming trend of teenagers committing suicide following altercations with parents. The parents are indirectly responsible as they do not spend quality time with their children. Instead, they measure success and failure in terms of marks in exams. 

Sunil Banerjee,

VIP Road. 

 Football lovers would rejoice on reading the report ?Game goes to classrooms?, February 24. With a population of 100 crore, it is shocking that India lags behind most Asian countries in terms of football standard. Providing coaching to students of city schools is definitely a step in the right direction. 

B.N. Bose, 

Dum Dum Park.

 Apropos the report ?Roma points out captors?, February 24, police often find it difficult to take criminals to task because of lack of cooperation from victims. Roma Jhawar should be praised for pointing out her abductors in an identification parade. 

Hara Lal Chakraborty, 

Arabinda Nagar.

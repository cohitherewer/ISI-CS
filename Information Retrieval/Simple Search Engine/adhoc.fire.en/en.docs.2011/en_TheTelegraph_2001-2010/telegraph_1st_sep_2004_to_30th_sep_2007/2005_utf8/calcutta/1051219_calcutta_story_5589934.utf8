The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 24x7 feed for tech township

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 After offices, it?s time for the 24x7 bug to bite the support systems ? two multi-use complexes and food courts ? in the state?s tech hub.

 According to the plan, the common-facility complexes will come up on 4.2 acre and 1 acre plots, while the food courts will take up 1.5 acres and .25 acre.

 The complexes will house bus, taxi and autorickshaw terminals, shop stops, medicine stores and PCOs. Restaurants, fast-food stalls, dhabas, coffee shops and ice cream parlours would find space in the two food courts.

 The state urban development department officials said the projects would be implemented as joint ventures between the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) and private companies.

 The CMDA will provide the land on which the private parties would build the complexes, and maintain and operate them on a 30-year lease. They will also pay an annual licence fee to the government body. The lease will be renewed periodically after performance assessment.

 ?We have invited expressions of interest from reputed builders and developers. We expect to complete the formalities within a month and start work early next year,? said CMDA secretary Anil Verma.

 Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said the project would provide basic facilities to people working in Sector V or visiting the area. ?We have started work on turning Sector V into a full-fledged industrial town, the first of its kind in the country. We want to make Sector V a model IT complex,? the minister added.

 Sector V, also known as Saltlec, is spread over 400 acres. The urban development department handed over 155 acres to Webel, the nodal agency for IT projects, for development and allotment of plots to companies. Webel and the department have allotted plots to 175 and 159 industrial units, respectively.

 Poor transport facilities, lack of eateries and markets are a pet peeve in Sector V.

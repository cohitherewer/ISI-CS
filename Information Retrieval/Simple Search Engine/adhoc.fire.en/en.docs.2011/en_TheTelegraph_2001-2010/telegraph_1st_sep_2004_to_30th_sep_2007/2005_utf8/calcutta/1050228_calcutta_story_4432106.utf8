The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

You can?t get through this week without...

Waking up early to catch the Oscars

The biggest celluloid event of the year is here at last! On Monday morning, watch 

the Oscars select the best Hollywood and foreign films of the year gone by and 

then wait for the winners to come to the city (if at all). If you are not a serious 

movie buff and are still sitting on the fence between Scorsese and Eastwood, just 

watch the stars sashay down the red carpet. With the likes of Johnny Depp and 

Kate Winslet on the nomination list, it?s bound to be a feast for the eyes. Don?t 

forget to root for Ashvin Kumar, the Indian (and Ritu Kumar?s son, at that) nominated 

in the Best Short Film category.

Accessorising your summer stock

Picking up some stylish accessories is a must as you get your summer wardrobe 

ready. With femininity being in sharp focus in the coming season, chunky neckpieces, 

bangles, earrings and anklets will ensure you?re in sync with the fashion mood 

of the moment. So hit the malls and roadside stalls to stock up enough to match 

the colours and motifs in your wardrobe.

Raving and ranting about the Budget

Oscars are not enough, better pay close attention to the winners of Budget 2005, 

too. It will rule discussions from boardrooms to boutiques, so get your basics 

right about how PC has performed. Did he bow to pressure from the left? Did industry 

smile or shrug? Nothing wrong in increasing outlay for the social sector, but 

are we playing safer than we should be? Know the right questions before stepping 

out of home on Monday evening.

Taking a Bewaafa break

After Bhansali?s Black, it won?t be a bad idea to return to Bollywood?s 

standard masala fare. So catch Dharmesh Darshan trying to recreate the 

Raja Hindustani magic with a star-studded cast including Anil Kapoor, Akshay 

Kumar, Kareena Kapoor and Sushmita Sen. As for the story, it?s a rehash of Hum 

Aapke Hain Kaun with fewer songs and more tears.

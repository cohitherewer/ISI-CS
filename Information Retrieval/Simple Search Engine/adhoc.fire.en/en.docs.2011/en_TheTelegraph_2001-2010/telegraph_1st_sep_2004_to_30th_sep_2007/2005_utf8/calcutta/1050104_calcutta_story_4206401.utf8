The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Straight from the heart

 Tens of thousands of lives have been lost and several more hopelessly ruined by the recent earthquake and tsunami. In an effort to assist in the relief and rehabilitation of the survivors of the tragedy, Prajna (a cultural forum), in association with Bhavna Records amp; Cassettes, is hosting an evening of Rabindrasangeet and readings from Tagore?s works. What is all the more heartening is that NRIs, like Dr Ananda Gupta (UK) and Sudeshna Basu (USA), have come forward to help the cause in their own way. This evening, Gupta?s devotional songs, like Asim aakashe aganya kiran, Jaage nath, and Safala karohe prabhu, seek courage, strength and solace from God to help overcome these distressing times. Basu?s Na banchabe amay jodi, Rudrabeshe kemon khela and Jaare nije tumi bhasiyechhile, acknowledge the superiority of Nature over mankind, at the same time asking for divine forgiveness and mercy for sins committed. The three songs, among others, have been selected specially in memory of tsunami victims. The programme also features readings by Sunil Gangopadhyay and Saoli Mitra from Tagore?s selected works.

 Event: An evening of Tagore songs and reading from his works

 When: Today at 6.30 pm

 Where: G.D. Birla Sabhagar

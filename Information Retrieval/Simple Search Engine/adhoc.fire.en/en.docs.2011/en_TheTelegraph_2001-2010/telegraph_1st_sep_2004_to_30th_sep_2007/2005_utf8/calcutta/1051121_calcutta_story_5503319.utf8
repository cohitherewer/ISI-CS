The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Goldie Hawn 

You are compassionate, yet practical. You are always ready to explore and willing to please, but you can?t handle rejection. Usually, you are a little timid to ask for help. You have a knack for doing the right thing at the right time. You value time and never miss an opportunity. You understand the value of money. You must learn to fix your emotions rather than fight them. ? Kusum Bhandari

 True, the 120-odd ?live? performers ? not just musicians, but fire-eaters, ventriloquists, magicians and the lot ? that regaled Park Street every night in the Sixties and Seventies can?t be resurrected in a contemporary context.

 But, a carousal corridor can still be recreated along what once used to be the first avenue of entertainment in town, feels Calcutta?s music fraternity. The return of live strains to Park Street on the back of Fete de la Musique, or World Music Day, even if just for an evening, is seen as an encouraging omen by most.

 As a pilot project, the city event is a great initiative, a big thumbs-up to live music, feels Nondon Bagchi of Hip Pocket. The outfit will perform classic rock covers at The Atrium on Tuesday evening as part of the World Music Day celebrations, presented by The French Association with The Park and Seagrams.

 ?However, to arrive at a sustainable model, it?s important to broad-base the concept of entertainment and also look at duos and trios, Bangla bands or even small acts, like a quiz contest, inside eateries. Standalone restaurants, which can?t afford a live band, can beam concert DVDs on in-house TVs,? suggests Nondon, enthused by the new buzz on Park Street.

 Jayshree, lead vocalist with Skinny Alley, slated to do an alternative/retro repertoire at Sourav?s to mark the occasion, agrees with Nondon that it?s a great platform for interaction. ?The underlying concept of Fete de la Musique is to communicate through various forms of music and this platform gives us a chance to do just that,? she acknowledges.

 The French Association is keen to provide the props for the motley melodies to mesh. ?This is usually a period of lull in Calcutta and we thought a basket of options in live music can create some excitement to plug that gap,? says Emmanuelle De Decker, deputy director, cultural affairs.

 The association is also contemplating wrap-around events, like interactive caf?s and short films on music, to bolster the World Music Day celebrations next year, not ruling out the possibility of a three-day carnival involving all stakeholders.

 But, World Music Day can?t be seen in isolation, if Park Street is to rock again, most concur. ?This is a great kick-off initiative, but we must also remember that here?s a brand new audience cooking and we can?t just wait for one June 21 to happen every year,? quips Nondon, seconded by talking drums exponent Kesivan Naidoo.

 Monojit of Orient Express, the countrys ?first and only Latin band?, feels it?s important to do gigs dedicated to issues and causes to be able to connect with the people. But, is the audience ready and receptive? ?Today, they only want fast numbers and cheap remixes,? laments Paul Mullick, blowing western classics on his romantic sax on Park Street for decades.

 Jayshree isn?t as dismissive, but concerned, nonetheless, about the lack of listeners. ?Life is so complicated that people hardly have the leisure to appreciate good music these days. All they seek is background pitter-patter most of the time,? she says. Still, a revival refrain resonates through Park Street, even if the song isn?t the same. And new pads are sprouting. Rahul Guha Roy of young acoustic rock duo Lightside is buoyed by ?the coffee houses? new propensity towards live bands?, for instance.

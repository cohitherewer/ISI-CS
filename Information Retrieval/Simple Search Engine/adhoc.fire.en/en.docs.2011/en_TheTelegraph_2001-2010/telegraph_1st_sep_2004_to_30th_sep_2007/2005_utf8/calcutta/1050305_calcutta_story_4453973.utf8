 A STAFF REPORTER

 With computer penetration in the east on the rise, local manufacturers are entering the market eyeing a significant share of the sales of personal computers (PC) and laptops. 

 ?We will be launching our Isyn brand of PCs and laptops on March 11 during the annual fair of Compass,? announced Dilip K. Banerjee, director, marketing, Syntech Group of Companies. 

 The 10-year-old IT solution provider is targeting both the home and the small business segment with its product offerings. It has also tied up with Webel, the state government?s nodal IT agency, to tap the government sector. 

 According to the company, the turnover target for the year 2005-06 is around Rs 102 crore, 40 per cent of which will come from the sale of PCs and laptops of Isyn brand. 

 While the company will continue selling other brands, like IBM, it has set an ambitious target of selling around 2,000 boxes a month by the last quarter of 2005-06. 

 The PCs ? three varieties: Novo, Prodigy and Trigger ? will be priced between Rs 18,000 and Rs 29,000, while the laptops will hit the market with a price tag of less than Rs 50,000. 

 ?Besides being price-competitive, our products will also match the established Indian brands in terms of quality and we will offer best possible after-sales service to our customers,? asserted Rakesh S. Ghosh, the company?s director in-charge of sales. 

 To augment production capacity ? the products will soon be launched in Assam, Orissa, Bihar and Jharkhand ? the Syntech group plans fresh infusion of capital to set up a state-of-the-art factory in Salt Lake?s Sector V.

 ?We have already been given land by Webel and we plan to start creating the infrastructure by April this year,? said Ghosh.

 As good as the best B-school products

 Budding managers from the Indian institutes of management (IIMs) can be compared with the best in the world and they can hold their own anywhere in the world, under any circumstance.

 Suresh M. Sundaresan, Chase Manhattan Bank professor of finance and economics at Columbia University, declared so at Joka on Monday.

 The renowned professor, an 8th batch student from IIM Calcutta, was in town to kick off the distinguished alumnus lecture series at his alma mater. He made a presentation on ?Consumer and Corporate Defaults: Lessons from Asia and Western Hemisphere?. 

 ?My experience suggests that our students are as good as, if not better than, the pass-outs from B-schools like Harvard or Stanford. Their depth of knowledge is beyond question. But, at times, there are complaints about their narrow focus,? Sundaresan told Metro on Tuesday afternoon. 

 Between his teaching assignments at Columbia University and extensive writings on finance and economic issues in leading magazines, Sundaresan is an accomplished trainer and has the experience of grooming executives at leading corporations like Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs.

 According to him, students from a wider cross-section ? in the West, one will even find management students with a background in music ? will help in broadening the horizon of the management graduates here.

 While delivering his address at the packed IIM Calcutta auditorium, Sundaresan recounted how the ?tumultuous 70s? ? Naxalite movement, India-Pakistan war, refugees from Bangladesh ? helped in broadening his perspective during his students days on IIM Calcutta?s BT Road campus.

 ?I came here as a qualified mechanical engineer, but the informal discussions on contemporary developments around us facilitated my development,? recounted the 1973 pass-out from the oldest IIM in the country. 

 Elaborating on the importance of learning beyond classroom, he gave the example of Columbia University, where students are exposed to foreign culture and language to make them global managers. 

 Though Sundaresan was happy ? on the basis of feedback from his friends in industry and academia ? with the way management education has evolved in the country in the past few years, he would like the IIMs to diversify their resource base. 

 Financial strength is a must for a management institute with global aspirations, he stressed.

 ?You need to have deep pockets to attract and keep scholars,? he said, suggesting that the IIMs look at new avenues like endowment from the alumni. ?I believe that there are a lot of grateful alumni around. Let them know they are wanted.? 

 Shekhar Chowdhury, director, IIM Calcutta, said the institute was working on strengthening its ties with old boys and girls.

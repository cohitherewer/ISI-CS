 Break in blade battle

 The Blade Breakers, not the animated but the actual ones, have taken a break. They have been beaten back by the book (read: school examinations).

 But this might just be the lull before another Beyblade storm. For, Takara, the Japanese producer of the top, is resuming manufacture.

 Says Sagarnil Ganguly, spokesperson for Funskool, distributor for the spinning top here: Beyblade came to India a year-and-a-half after it caught the imagination of youngsters abroad. It is now pass? in those countries. As a result, Takara had stopped manufacturing the toy. But now with such huge demand in India, it is resuming manufacture. The supply would be continuous.

 The recent lull is confirmed by Ganguly. The phones do not ring as often as they would till a month back. But once the exams are over we expect to face a demand rush, as most of our distributors and the shops selling Beyblade have huge pre-orders for the toy.

 The spinning toy had been in the local market for some time, but the craze caught on only after a show by the same name was aired on Cartoon Network in the month of June.

 Since then, the demand for the top with blades has been double that of supply. Funskool, importers of the toy into India, has struggled to cope with the demand because of an erratic supply flow.

 And the Beyblade boom has reached far and wide. From Bandel to Burdwan to Kharagpur, the demand for the latest boy toy has spun out of the city limits.

 We were flooded with calls for the toy from the suburban areas, too. Children have been calling us from Howrah and Hooghly. We could only allot 700 pieces for the districts from the total of 3,000 pieces that we received in our last consignment, says Ganguly. 

 Even the shops are doing their bit to stoke childrens interest and fuel demand. If Landmark hosted a Beyblade competition on August 15, which saw hundreds of boys queuing up to spend I-Day evening engaged in the big fight, Crossword has now pushed up supply and pulled down prices.

 It had become impossible to meet the demand, both for the importers and for us. So, we decided to import the toy on our own. We are giving two Beyblades for Rs 199. The response has been very good and we are not turning away anyone, says Sidharth Pansari of Crossword.

 The next consignment of Beyblades to hit the store in mid-September would be the advanced version of the top.

 The Beyblade show on Cartoon Network has four versions of beyblades that keep on moving forward after a particular time. We are introducing the second series of Beyblades that would coincide with the one on television so that children can buy what they see in the serial, says Ganguly.

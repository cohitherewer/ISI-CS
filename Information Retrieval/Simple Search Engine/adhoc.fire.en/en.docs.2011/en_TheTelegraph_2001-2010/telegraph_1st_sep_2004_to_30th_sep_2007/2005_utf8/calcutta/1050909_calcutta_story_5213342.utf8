 Senco Jewellery Palace of Lake Market, in collaboration with the Diamond Trading Company (DTC), is playing host to a Diamond Ring Utsav till the end of the month. 

 The festival, showcasing more than 1,000 diamond rings for both men and women, was inaugurated by Tollywood actress Sudipta Chakraborty and singer-turned-actor Saheb Chatterjee on September 7. 

 Diamonds are usually perceived as expensive buys. We will offer diamond rings at great bargains, adding them to the shopping list of the middle class, says Premjit Sengupta, eastern area manager of DTC. 

 The range on display includes solitaires as well as cut-diamonds of various carats. Brands like Aasmi, Sangini, Nakshatra, Vanshi, Ekka and in-house creations are all part of the Utsav.

 The right blend of affordability and great designs makes these rings apt for gift items as well as personal buys, says Arjun Sen of Senco Jewellery Palace. The price starts from Rs 2,500 and goes into lakhs.

 To add to the fun, a contest called Guess the Diamond Weight gives buyers a chance to walk away with a ring by gauging the weight of the diamond embedded in it. 

 so on offer are exchange schemes allowing customers to exchange old gold or silver ornaments for diamond jewellery.

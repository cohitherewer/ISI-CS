The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Crushed on pavement

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Hari Ram Verma, in his late 60s, was run over while walking down the pavement of New CIT Road, near Todi Mansion, a few yards from Lalbazar, around 11.20 am on Tuesday. 

 A minibus on the BBD Bag -Airport route hit him from behind. Profusely bleeding, Verma was rushed to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

 Police intervened and prevented a mob from setting the bus on fire. 

 The enraged people, however, managed to smash the two windscreens.

 A little over a week after eight people were killed when a taxi collided with a truck at Taratala, the death toll in street accidents continues to rise. Tuesday?s accident was the second of its kind to occur near the Calcutta Police headquarters in recent times. 

 The last one occurred a few days ago, when a middle-aged man was killed after he fell under the wheels of a bus. 

 If figures are any indicators, the four months between November and February have always been harbingers of death for the city. 

 Last year, while January witnessed the death of 40 people on the roads, 36 had died the month after.

 On an average, while the death rate remained 36.83 per month in 2003-2004, it shot up to 38.75 per month during the ?winter months?.

 ?While vehicles usually move slower in the area around the police headquarters, the crowd on the street is very dense. One can?t make changes overnight,? claimed Arun Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (traffic). 

 The driver of the killer bus was arrested, and traffic police have launched a probe to find out if the vehicle was properly maintained. 

 The probe, incidentally, is in line with a string of changes that are in the offing. 

 ?Certain steps have already been initiated, but we are still in the process of finalising a few diversions,? said a senior officer of the traffic department. 

 ?As a wake-up call, we have placed dividers on the road in front of the Lalbazar police headquarters, and even movement along the adjoining pavements has been regulated,? said another officer of the department.

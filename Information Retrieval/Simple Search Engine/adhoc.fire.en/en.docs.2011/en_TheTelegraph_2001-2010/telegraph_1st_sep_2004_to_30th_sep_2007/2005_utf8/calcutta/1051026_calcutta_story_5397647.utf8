The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Twin city alert on wood brigands

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 With two raids unearthing over Rs 1-crore worth of contraband sandalwood in less than a week, the forest department is planning a major crackdown to blow the cover off an international racket of sandalwood smugglers active in Howrah and Calcutta.

 Acting on tip-offs, the sleuths of the department?s Howrah wing, led by Howrah divisional forest officer (DFO) Joydeb Mukhopadhyay, raided Jorabagan, in north Calcutta, and Amta, in Howrah. The first raid was conducted on October 18 and the second last Thursday.

 A huge consignment of red sandalwood, worth well over Rs 1 crore, was unearthed in the first raid, while the second yielded about Rs 10-lakh worth of white sandalwood.

 ?It seems that a big racket is active in Calcutta, with its tentacles spread in the adjacent areas,? Mukhopadhyay told Metro on Tuesday.

 In the first case, the sandalwood was carefully concealed on the premises of a transport company. In Amta, it was hidden in the home of a local resident. 

 The forest department officers are planning to activate ?all machinery? to look into the matter.

 ?We are holding a high-level meeting on the issue. Police will have to be consulted,? the forest department officer said.

 Initial investigation by the forest department has revealed that the consignments of sandalwood are hoarded in the Burrabazar area. Smugglers make use of road transport, trains and occasionally ferry services. 

 ?We are trying to pinpoint where the racket originates. Probably, the consignments are carried to Calcutta from Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh. The consignments enter Howrah on their way to Calcutta along National Highway 6, popularly known as Bombay Road,? the officer said.

 Forest department officers think big-time operators belong to the gang. 

 ?We think we are going to stir a hornet?s nest. Heads will roll if we can bust this racket,? the officer said.

 Primary investigation suggests that the leaders of the racket are based in various pockets of Calcutta and Howrah.

 He said there is a huge international demand for Indian sandalwood. 

 ?We have only begun to guess the scale of the entire business.? The Howrah forest department plans to set up a special task force to deal exclusively with this menace, a department officer said.

 A forest department official said that there may be more than one racket active in Calcutta and its adjacent areas. 

 DFO Mukhopadhyay said his department had already initiated an ?in-depth? investigation into the matter. 

 ?We will need police help. We will very soon sit and chart out a course of action,? he signed off.

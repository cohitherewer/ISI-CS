The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Snips and styles

Himika Chaudhuri, Zeeshan Jawed

Calcutta 

got yet another specialised hair destination at City Centre (D109) in Salt Lake 

on Monday. The new AN John outlet at this address is a one-stop solution for all 

hair treatments, from tips to styles and cuts. 

 Well-known hair stylist Raman Bharadwaj is offering his expertise to create everything from contemporary hair designs to classic coiffeurs at this plush studio. ?Calcuttans are becoming more conscious about their looks and are ready to invest time and money on their appearance,? felt Raman. 

 A detailed examination of a client?s hair type followed by ways to make it beautiful and healthy is the promise on the cards. ?The tips will be very personalised and we will offer advice depending on the hair quality and the lifestyle of the person concerned,? offered Raman.

If one wants a complete pamper package, this is not 

the place to head for, however. ?Skin is not my forte but we do intend to introduce 

nail art at a later date, which is also very creative,? said the hair stylist, 

who was among the six Indian stylists to participate in the L?Oreal Professionel 

hair show in Paris last year. 

 Fabric feel

 This nondescript shop next to the Elgin Road post office, a stone?s throw from the bustling Forum, can easily be missed. It?s only when you step into this tiny outlet that you realise what a treasure house of natural fabric Anushree is. 

 The store that celebrated its silver jubilee anniversary recently, remains a favoured destination for designers and design students alike, who drop by to choose from a vast collection of cottons and silks here. 

 The store stocks weaves brought in exclusively from Bhagalpur and one can expect to find anything from cottons in bold colours and cotton dupion to matka and other silks in a variety of colours, all in the price range of Rs 30 to Rs 200 per metre. 

 ?We sell at wholesale prices, which makes it easy to buy fabric in bulk,? said owner Nirmal Fatehpuria. 

 Interesting gold prints, butis and coloured prints in cottons ranging from subtle pastels to vibrant pinks and blues are on offer. A lot of the fabric has been textured either with zari for a rich look or with another fabric of a different colour for a dramatic effect. 

 ?While the plain fabric sells best, we also have salwarkurta sets and matching dupattas made from the same fabric, designed and stitched by us,? added Nirmal. Salwar-kurta sets are priced at Rs 190 and above, while dupattas start at Rs 50 onwards. 

 Spa span

 Next time you find yourself stressed out, head for The Kerala Ayurvedic Health Spa on 28/A Bokultaia Lane in Kasba, opened recently. 

 ?Ayurvedic treatments help relax the body and mind like no other. Our products are 100 per cent natural. All the oils and powders we use are plant extracts,? claimed Harshajeet Kuroop, director of the spa chain. 

 This is their first venture in Calcutta, but the spa has been enjoying good patronage in cities like Delhi, Chennai and Bangalore for a while now, says Kuroop. There are six outlets in Bombay alone. 

 Some of the massages that can be enjoyed here are as follows:

 Navarakizhi: Special medicated rice 

is blended with milk and herbs and then tied into a cloth bag and pounded on the 

body. The therapy is believed to augment muscular strength and stamina.

 Elakizhi: This is a herbal leaf pouch 

therapy, which is said to reduce aches and pains. It is believed to be helpful 

in treating arthritis and muscular-skeletal diseases. 

 Shirodhara: It involves pouring a steady 

stream of a soothing concoction of oils and herbs on the forehead for complete 

stress relief and nourishment of the entire nervous system.

 Udwarthanam: This therapy with medicated 

powders is used for glowing skin and weight reduction.

 The massages, which cost Rs 450 and above, are supposed to be done by trained professionals from Kerala.

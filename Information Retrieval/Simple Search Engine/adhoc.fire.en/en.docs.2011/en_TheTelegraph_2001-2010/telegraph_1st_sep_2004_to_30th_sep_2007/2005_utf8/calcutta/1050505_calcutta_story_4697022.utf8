 Vagrant home shift for nine patients

 Ousted by in-laws, dumped by husband and shunned by relatives, her only solace is the five-month-old girl lying beside her in the Dalhousie Ward of Calcutta Medical College and Hospital. 

 Meet Manju Mandal ? a patient today, a likely vagrant tomorrow.

 She is not alone. Eight other patients have been languishing in the hospital for at least six to seven years, though their ailments were cured long ago. They have nowhere to go, no one to turn to.

 The hospital authorities on Wednesday decided to move the vagrancy court and seek a directive to shift the nine to homes for vagrants across the city. The hearing is scheduled for Thursday.

 ?We can?t provide shelter to them for an indefinite period. The patients have all recovered from their ailments and are now occupying place, which could have been allotted to those in need of urgent treatment,? said deputy superintendent Amarendra Biswas.

 ?If they are declared vagrants, they will at least find a home to live in,? he added, justifying the hospital?s decision.

 On Thursday, the nine will be picked up from various wards, including CB Top at the old emergency building, and taken to a vagrancy court in an ambulance van. The court will be held at Dhakuria Vagrant House, Haltu.

 The history of each of these patients will be narrated before the magistrate. Once declared ?vagrants?, they will be sent to new addresses. 

 ?I am not sure where they will dump me, but wherever it is, I will not take my daughter there. She should be allowed to grow up in a proper place,? said Manju. 

 Around her bed in one corner of a small room, gathered several others who were helping her pack her belongings. 

 ?Pata nahin ab kya hoga,? Manju broke down, inconsolable.

 Most in the hospital could sense that a grim fate awaits Manju and the rest. At the hospital, even the nurses admitted, they had never complained, even when asked to spend nights on the floor.

 Besides two assured meals a day, the nine would often have the company of the ward boys and attendants, who would help them forget their nightmarish past. 

 ?It was late at night. I remember, my wife carried me to the emergency outdoor as I was crying in pain. That was the last time I saw her. Since then, I have been confined to this ward,? recalled Tapeswar Singh, the oldest in the group of nine.

 With his left arm and leg paralysed, Tapeswar has been lying in the male ward of CB Top since September 1997.

 Health officials claimed that Calcutta Medical College was not the only hospital that would move the vagrancy court. 

 Almost all medical colleges in the city are planning similar moves and are waiting for the nod of the department of social welfare.

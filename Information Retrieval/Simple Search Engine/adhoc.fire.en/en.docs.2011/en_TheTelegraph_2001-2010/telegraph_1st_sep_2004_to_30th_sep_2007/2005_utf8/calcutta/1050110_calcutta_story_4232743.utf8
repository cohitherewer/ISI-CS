 Plans to refurbish the beleaguered Academy of Fine Arts, one of the city?s oldest art galleries, have received a setback. 

 Former trustee board president Russi Mody?s resignation has led to a financial crunch and administrative problems. 

 The ex-boss of Tisco had resigned on October 6. Since then, the Academy has not had a president, although S.B. Ganguly, chairman of Exide, has been elected chairman of the board of trustees. 

 ?The president will be elected in our next annual general meeting,? said Col (retd) A.K. Das, Academy director. 

 Mody took over as president in 1997, at the instance of Lady Ranu Mookerjee, who had been the Academy chairperson since the death of her husband, Sir Biren Mookerjee.

 According to sources, Ashok Krishna Dutta, a senior vice-president of the Academy, will chair all meetings as president till the next annual general meeting. 

 ?Since Mody?s resignation, the executive board and board of trustees are not working in tandem,? alleged Jahar Das Gupta, one of the vice-presidents. Hence, development work of the Academy was being hindered. ?Both the bodies should work in unison to save the Academy,? agreed Pradipta Kanungo, another vice-president.

 The Academy began in a small room of the Indian Museum on August 15, 1933. Maharaja Prodyot Kumar Tagore was the first president. 

 The present building on Cathedral Road came up in 1960, on a 1.25-acre plot leased out by the state government. 

 However, shortage of funds has dealt a severe blow to the Academy. Vice-president Das Gupta said its museum, which has an invaluable collection, has no proper records.

 ?We fear that several artefacts, paintings, garments and manuscripts have gone missing as proper records are not maintained in a non-existent security system,? he said. 

 Besides, the condition of the five art galleries and the 735-seat auditorium is deplorable. ?There is an immediate need to overhaul the auditorium,? said theatre personality Rudraprasad Sengupta. 

 ?The boards of the stage need to be improved and made more compact. The stage must be equipped with a proper lighting system,? he stressed. 

 The auditorium of the Academy, where the national theatre festival has been held for the past 21 years and renowned groups like Bohurupee and Nandikar were born, needs to be urgently modernised. 

 ?People must come forward and help the Academy,? Sengupta asserted.

 Mayor Subrata Mukherjee said: ?I will definitely extend help. Calcutta Municipal Corporation has waived 50 per cent of the tax dues through our waiver scheme.? 

 However, director Das said the tax dues were worth several lakhs. ?We still owe Rs 12.5 lakh to CMC and Rs 15 lakh to Life Insurance Corporation for a group gratuity scheme,? Das elaborated. 

 So, the Rs 3.5-crore revamp plan has gone awry. 

 It envisaged the setting up of an air-conditioned gallery of international standards, overhauling the museum, upgrading the auditorium and giving the building a fresh coat of paint.

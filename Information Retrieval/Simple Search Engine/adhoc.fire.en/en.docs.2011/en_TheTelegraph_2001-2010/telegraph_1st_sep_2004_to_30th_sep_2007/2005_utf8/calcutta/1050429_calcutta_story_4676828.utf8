The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Rolling in success

 They skated their way to victory with panache and a mix of speed, skill and creativity. Young Metro catches the stars in action.

 A bowl and saucer balanced on her head, Sprihi Kanoria does a full camel on the glistening sheet of ice. The strains of Chariots of Fire echo in the rink and strobe lights paint dreamy patterns on the white canvas of the surface. Cutting circles around Sprihi, Mayuri G. and Sayan Chaudhuri glide au pair, in synchronised harmony. Soon after, a bevy of colourful skaters takes over. The movements get more vigorous as Tata Young urges on ? Dhoom macha le.

 The audience, comprising Sunday evening revellers at Clown Town, breaks into applause at this show of artistic skating from the students of Zenith Roller Skating Academy. 

 The show was the pi?ce de resistance at the prize distribution ceremony of the 1st Roller Skating Championship at Patuli on Sunday evening. After the 30-minute exhibition of gliding grace, the viewers gathered outside for the prize distribution. 

 Two mornings had tested their skills in three categories ? speed skating, artistic skating and fun skating (for beginners). Saloni Bagaria, Ridhi Virmani and Shramana Bhattacharya were all excitement, watching others take the stage. Yelling out the name of their academy in chorus every time a winner from their ranks was announced, they were soon rich with a couple of medals each. While for the two Class V students of Mahadevi Birla Girls School, it was ?fun? that justified the time spent on wheels, Lakshmipat Singhania Academy?s Ridhi had ?picking up something new? as her reason. 

 When Roopkatha Ganguly received her gold for having scored a record 90, she ran off stage to hug her mother. No skates were needed for that sprint. The Class III student had performed Odissi on skates. In fun skating, little Brishti Ghosh had stolen a march over the others ? including a Cinderella, a Christian Bride and many Santas ? with her costume of leaves. The Jungle Girl therefore was no surprise winner in the category that required beginners to roll in fancy dress.

 Rishabh Nahata of MP Birla Foundation may have lost the gold but won many hearts. The diminutive Class IX student was the only one in the tournament to take the rink without a coach. ?When Clown Town was at its earlier address near our house, I used to go and learn from the trainers there. I heard about the competition two days ago. Those two days were enough for practice,? he said. 

 The star was Sprihi. With two golds and a silver plus a trophy, the Class XII student declared that she was now set for the national roller-skating contest. Exams were clearly not an immediate concern. 

 The evening belonged to the two coaches ? Shubhro Ganguly and Madhuchhanda Mookerjee, of Palm Avenue Skating Rink and Zenith, who were crowned the best coaches in speed skating and artistic skating, respectively. 

 ?There are more good skaters in the city, who were missing. Next year, we will make it an open championship so that skaters can sign up individually, without endorsement from coaches,? said Clown Town director Sanjay Maheswari. ?And yes, this will be an annual event.?

 What?s on your mind this week

 Pressure point

 The generation-gap issue,which had taken a temporary backseat, is back in the spotlight. Tiyasha Biswas?s suicide points to the gravity of the improper educational atmosphere in most schools. Her case is an indication of the frustration many students face in school. The truth is, both teachers and students are losing patience with each other. But this would not have happened if teachers had been more patient. The mistreatment of a young girl by another reputed school?s teacher is an indication of that. Parents share responsibility for the situation. When adults fail to embrace children just as they are, telling them what they lack and what is expected of them, they are at a loss. They suffer from low self-esteem and impatience. Young adults constitute almost half the country?s population. Yet, the importance of imparting healthy education to ensure a bright future is yet to be realised.

 Killer wheels

 Heal the world, make it a better place/For you and for me and the entire human race

 These lines seem inappropriate in a city where children die regularly on the roads because of negligence of traffic personnel. Trucks and heavy vehicles often break rules. The ghastly death of Asha and Pushpa Mahato on April 14 is not a stray incident. It brings to the forefront a vicious cycle of corruption between drivers and cops who jeopardise lives for paltry sums. It?s time the authorities stopped blaming each other and took steps to remove the malaise.

 United in chaos

 It is disheartening to see JU students boycotting exams. That unity is strength is well known, but its application in situations like these leads to ruin. CU?s Part-I, English (hons) exams are scheduled from June 7. So are other BA (hons) papers. On a visit to College Street recently, I saw students hunting for last-minute tips. With changes in syllabi, students seem not to have a single minute?s rest. I hope everything works out well for CU students.

 US and them

 The US is again attempting to impose an imperialistic policy. The difference in this decade is that Russia is absent. America?s persistent interference in the affairs of the UAE symbolises its intentions. America?s attack on Iraq could be justified by the excuse of attacking grassroots of terrorism. The US wanted to benefit from the oil-rich nation, but is now interfering in the political processes of the country. Now, it is also meddling in the affairs of Lebanon and Syria. Freedom of Lebanon is justifiable provided the US does not have any evil intention. India?s agreement with Iran on setting up a gas pipeline also met with strong US opposition.

 Water woes

 Violence lurks everywhere today. Anderson Club (The Indian Life-Saving Society), is an example. I feel sympathy for the tiny tots who are in tears when forced into the water by the instructors. It is shameful. These clubs should curb their money-making tendencies. Calcutta has a long way to go before it can be called a metropolitan, in infrastructure and mentality of the people. It is time Calcuttans realise the ethos of a disciplined and well-educated society.

 A rainy Saturday evening

 Carve me out of touchwood, 

 paint me with hope 

 and give me a rainy Saturday evening. 

 One moment, devoid of anything else 

 but the texture of entwined fingers

 One moment 

 devoid of anything else 

 but the faded background music, 

 unimportant, 

 through the silent blizzards in the brain 

 covering up wounds fresh or old... 

 And ten million stars of gold 

 pretending to make prophecies 

 for... 

 One moment. 

 Teach me your words 

 dare me to dream and... 

 Give me a rainy Saturday evening. 

 Pale light, pale light 

 beckoning from so far 

 like a hopeless will-o-the-wisp 

 Or the illusions of 

 a rainy Saturday evening? 

 In a month Ive played with too many knives 

 scooped out celestial hypocrites 

 carved many a deceptive doll, clown-faced... 

 Tell me, have I overdone? 

 Ive stabbed the lost, guileless poet inside 

 Hes gone... 

 How long before these stains of blood fade? 

 Like the pair of faded blue jeans, 

 torn, weathered... treasured in the closet 

 to be dragged out on the night 

 of the hunt for nirvana 

 On the night of atonement and confessions 

 of forbidden dreams and wishes 

 and purging of the sins 

 ...of a rainy Saturday evening.

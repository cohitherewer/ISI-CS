 True taste of China in town

 Its perhaps the most experimented cuisine in the citys gourmetscape. If the posh restaurants dish out tempered variations and the small haunts in every other lane cook up the Chowmein-Chilli Chicken staple, its the eateries at China Town that offer the most authentic selection of Chinese cuisine in the city.

 Goodlife treks through the dingy lanes of Tangra in east Calcutta and checks out a few of the favourite destinations.

 Kimling 

 Restaurateur Monica Liu gifted Tangra its first air-conditioned eatery way back in 1991. She opened Kimling when her family leather business got into a rough patch. 

 Cooking was always a passion. When the business was closed down, opening a restaurant was the only option left for me, says Liu. 

 Kimling came up on 13 South Tangra Road with a seating capacity of less than 50. Now, it can pack in as many as 200 covers. 

 The personal touch in the fare at Kimling is the restaurants success mantra, believes Liu. Visiting the market to shop for fresh ingredients is part of the ladys daily routine.

 The various provinces in China offer different cuisines. But since Calcuttans have a taste for spicy food, we offer more of Szechwan, she reveals. 

 Most of the recipes used in the kitchen are picked up by Liu during her extensive travels in China and Hong Kong. 

 And not just recipes, some of the ingredients are also sourced from the east. While the local markets supply the fresh materials, sauces and spices such as Oyster Sauce, Hoisin Sauce and curry pastes are sourced from Hong Kong and Thailand.

 Liu rates the soups high among the Kimling favourites and lists Pepper Fish, Pepper Prawns, Chicken Crispy Fried Wanton, Mongolian Chicken, Chicken in Pak Choi, Prawn with Black Bean Sauce and Fish with Green Pepper among the must trys. 

 Beijing

 Liu gauged the success of Kimling for eight long years before she decided to delve deeper into the culinary business. Her second venture Beijing upped its shutters on 77/1 Christopher Road in 1999. 

 Despite the restaurant boom in other parts of the city, the demand for the Tangra brand of Chinese was always on the rise. We were not being able to accommodate the footfall pressure in Kimling and hence we decided to expand, she remembers. 

 With bright crimson interiors and 300 covers, Beijing remains one of the most popular eateries in the hub.

 In Beijing, the stress is on specialities that usually dont feature on the menu of other restaurants. These recipes are kept secrets in our kitchen, she smiles. 

 Liu recommends delicacies such as Fried Meatballs, Peking Chicken (breast of chicken cooked in Hoisin Sauce), Thai Chicken (boneless pieces of Chicken cooked in Thai leaves and other spices) and Steam Fish. 

 Kafulok

 Quite a long trek from the main food hub, Kafulok is tucked away in one of the bylanes of Tangra. But that doesnt prevent the restaurant from having a full house on weekend evenings.

 Located on 47 South Tangra Road, the eatery doles out the routine Chinese fare thats splashed on the menu of every other restaurant. But its the low price tags and large portions that make Kafulok a popular pick. 

 We dont believe that you need to spend a fortune to have a good meal. Our prices are economical and suit almost all pockets, says manager H.Y. Chen.

 The crispy pieces of Spring Chicken and Pepper Chicken are the star items in the starters here. Garlic Prawns, Chilly Garlic Prawns, Chicken Stir Fried with Vegetables and Cantonese Chicken rule the roost in the main course.

 Big Boss

 A relatively new addition to the Tangra stable, this sprawling 300-seater eatery tells the tale of yet another tannery-turned-restaurant.

 I had worked in Waldorf earlier in my career before joining my fathers leather business. The business was not doing well so we closed it down and opened Big Boss, says owner Xie Ying Xing. 

 Started off on a small scale, with rising footfalls this double-storey restaurant on 54C Matheswartala Road is now one of the favourite hangouts in China Town. 

 The fresh quality of our food has made us so popular. In this highly competitive market one cant afford to make mistakes, smiles chef Joseph Lai. The food offered is high on spices to suit local taste buds. 

 What marks out Big Boss from other Tangra haunts is the wide range of vegetarian dishes it offers. Specialities like Kung Pou Paneer, Singapore Paneer and Hakka Paneer are among the bestsellers. 

 Like many Tangra restaurants, the spread steers clear of beef and pork, with fish and prawn being the mainstay of the menu.

 Bamboo bounty

 SANGITA SULTANIA G. ROY

 Enjoy good health, wealth and a steady marriage, all because of an innocuous little plant. So says Feng Shui of tiny bamboo trees that unsuspecting souls mistake as purely decorative pieces. 

 The cluster of bamboo shoots, usually bunched together in a glass bowl with colourful pebbles at the base as sold in gift shops, do look very ornamental indeed. 

 aced on table tops, mantelpieces or any forlorn nook and cranny in the house, these lend a dash of nature and perk up the mood of the room. 

 But Feng Shui professes to put them to better use by placing the apparatus in key directions with significant implications. If you place three stems in the east you are supposed to enjoy good health, while four stems in the south-east is all you need to get wealthy!

?The east and the south-east directions are ruled by wood energy,? says Feng Shui expert and Goodlife columnist Pinky Kapoor. But what is health and wealth without love? Not to fret, if your marriage has been on the rocks, just steady the boat by tying two stems with a red ribbon and placing it in the south-west direction, which is believed to be the marriage corner. 

 Add to the lucky charm and the beauty of the whole thing by placing it in a crystal bowl and dropping blue and green marbles in it. ?This helps attract the energy of the elements as well,? advises Pinky. And the best part is, the plant requires little care for all its lofty services. Keep it indoors and just change the water once a week to preserve all its bounty.

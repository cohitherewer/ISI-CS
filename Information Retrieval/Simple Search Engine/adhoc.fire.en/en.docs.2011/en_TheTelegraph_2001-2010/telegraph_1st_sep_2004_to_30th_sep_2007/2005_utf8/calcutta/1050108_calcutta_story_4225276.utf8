 The colour photographs by Ahmed Ali show three generations of the Haywards posing before St Paul?s cathedral. The paterfamilias, Sir Anthony, seems to tower over the rest. He is a big man. His wife, Jenifer, standing next to him in a flowered dress, looks plump, cheerful and homely. 

 The third generation of Haywards, seven little boys and girls, are all dressed in casuals unlike their parents. They smile shyly. It is their first visit to India, and they wanted to make the trip with their grandparents, who besides being old India hands themselves, visit Calcutta every year.

 Last Monday, Sir Anthony and Jenifer celebrated their golden anniversary at the cathedral, where they were married, and were photographed by the selfsame Ahmed Ali.

 Comfortably ensconced in a capacious chair in his Bengal Club room on Friday morning, Sir Anthony admits he could not recognise the photographer after 50 years. His daughter Charlotte was there to keep him company. 

 Sir Anthony, who lives in Sandwich, 100 km from London, says he first visited India in 1948. He was with the Royal Navy Squadron then and earned 11 shillings a day. His father promised to double his salary to Rs 500 if he joined his business. Thus began his association with Calcutta, that lasted till 1978. 

 His father sold his business in 1959. He joined Shaw Wallace in 1970 and left it eight years later as burrasaab, when he was knighted. He makes light of the Indian order of chivalry which gave Calcutta the name of ?City of Dreadful Knights?.

 His father-in-law was Dr Frank McCay, who practised in Calcutta. His mother was born in Madras in 1900. Her father was the chief presidency magistrate of Madras. His daughters Charlotte and Emma and son Simon were born in Calcutta, while Charles?s birthplace was Madras.

 Life in Calcutta was easy. At the colour-coded clubs (?A great mistake obviously,? he comments) they danced till daybreak. He took 15 to 20 minutes to drive from his Alipore home to 4, Bankshall Court Street office. Messages from London came in coded cable. ?My first job in Shaw Wallace was to decode cables,? he recalls. One had to wait for six hours for trunk calls to get through. ?Bedrooms had air-conditioned cubicles. The machines chugged away and if you were lucky, it would be cooler inside. Khus khus tatties were put on the roofs of cars.? Teleprinters were a godsend when they arrived in the 60s. Faxes followed in the 80s.

 Though both he and his daughter are shocked at the manner in which beautiful old buildings are being pulled down, they both agree that Calcutta is a city with individuality.

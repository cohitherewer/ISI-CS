 Fun return: Mark Waugh will be part of Toon 

Cricket

 Cartoon Network is all set to raise the heat on the fun barometer this December with Toon Cricket 2005 ? The Tri-Toon Triangular Try Anything Tournament ? a combination of cartoons and cricket. Now in its fifth year, Toon Cricket 2005 promises to be even more exciting, as former Pakistan skipper Wasim Akram and former Australian cricketer Mark Waugh join the battle for this year?s trophy. Toon Cricket 2005 will see the best spinners, batsmen and fielders from the world of toons, kids and international cricket on the field. Two lucky winners of Toon Cricket 2005 on-air ?Apna Yaar? contest will get the chance to lead one of the teams in the finals in December 2005 against Akram and Mark Waugh. 

 Announcing the event, Anshuman Misra, managing director, Turner International India said: ?We are extremely excited that this popular and signature event will see our toons battling it out with international cricketing legends, Wasim Akram and Mark Waugh this year.? 

 An interactive on-air and off-air promotional campaign featuring Waugh and Akram will precede the fun-filled extravaganza. Toon Cricket 2005 representatives will visit over 100,000 kids through a 200-school contact program in select cities that will include exciting pre-event activities and prizes. 

 To pitch their team against those of Waugh and Akram and also win cricketing gear autographed by the cricketing champions, kids need to tune in to Cartoon Network daily from 4 to 7 pm and catch the cricketer of the day. Kids can enter the contest via SMS, on-line or via post. 

 In the past, Toon Cricket has received an overwhelming response amongst kids ? with a live audience of over 60,000 present at the Toon Cricket 2003 match at Mumbai.

 Fully filmi: Missed Call

 It is a film by two directors, driven by one dream. ?Missed Call is a film by Gaurav Sengupta (the protagonist). It is all about this young man, Gaurav, who dreams of making that perfect film. And to catch life in the raw, he always has his Handycam on. The film is entirely from his perspective and to some extent developed by itself? We don?t really exist,? Mridul Toolsidass, one of the directors of the film that opened in the city on Friday, tells Metro.

 Mridul, 28, who has co-directed and co-written the script with Vinay Subramanian, is originally from Kutch but was born in Calcutta and studied in La Martiniere before going to Delhi to do his ?Masters in finance?. He moved to Mumbai in the hope of getting a chance to make films.

 ?For two years, I got involved in all kinds of technical projects working with editors and cameramen to learn the ropes? I had half-written the script when I met Vinay at a Mumbai dhaba. He had done a film-making course and had assisted in ad films; he was also associated with Prithvi Theatre. When I narrated the script to him he identified with it immediately and in fact every time we narrated it to the actors or to the crew, they felt it was their story and so it grew. The budget was very, very low but the film was possible because many people charged only half of what is usually due to them.?

 Missed Call has Ankur Vikal in the lead, with Naseeruddin Shah?s daughter Heeba. Both Ankur and Heeba are from NSD and actors from Naseer?s theatre group Motley. But they both have had some screen experience ? Ankur in Mahesh Dattani?s Mango Souffl? and Vishal Bhardwaj?s Maqbool; Heeba in several appearances on the small screen.

 Heeba tells Metro from Mumbai: ?These two young directors, who are now good friends, had come to see a play of ours. They needed Ankur for the lead and then they saw me and asked me to join. I play just a small role, the love angle. But I loved the script and the character Gayatri, the girl Gaurav falls in love with. She is a lot like me, though with a different name. We finished the film in just 12 days. It was good fun working whole nights sometimes.?

 Is this the kind of role she is looking for in films? ?I don?t think I should limit myself by saying I will do only these kind of roles, because I look forward to doing more and different kinds of films, but I did enjoy working with these new directors.?

 And the obvious question, does the film have anything to do with mobile phones? ?Well, there is something about a phone but you have to see the film to really understand the title,? says Mridul.

 There may not be any really big release till Diwali but that shouldn?t stop you from heading for the movie theatres. To counter the post-Puja fatigue and the absence of the new blockbusters, INOX has come up with reduced ticket prices one day of the week.

 So, on all the remaining Mondays in October ? 17, 24, 31 ? you can catch the films at INOX (Forum) and INOX (City Centre) after noon for Rs 79 and Rs 99 only. The morning shows, of course, come cheaper than that.

 ?We have seen that between Puja and Diwali, movie-watching really dips,? says Subhashish Ganguly, general manager of INOX (City Centre). ?So we are starting this special offer to attract as many people as we can to watch the films during this phase.?

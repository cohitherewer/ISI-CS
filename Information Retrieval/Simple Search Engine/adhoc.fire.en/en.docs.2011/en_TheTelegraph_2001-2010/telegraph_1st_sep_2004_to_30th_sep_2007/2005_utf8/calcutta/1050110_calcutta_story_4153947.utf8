 Dud drugs being pushed

 - Pharmacy-firm nexus propels sale of inferior substitutes

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR 

 Sanjay De Bakshi, a city-based surgical gastroenterologist, had put a patient on levofloxacin, a high-quality, infection-control drug that costs more than Rs 100 a tablet. The pharmacies the patient?s relatives went to said the drug was not available, but one of them sold the relatives a substitute, costing Rs 5, and assured them it had the same composition as the prescribed drug. 

 By the time De Bakshi learnt about it, the infection level had increased significantly, prompting a switchover to a higher group of antibiotics and immediate hospitalisation.

 Across Calcutta, a pernicious nexus has developed between some pharmacies and drug companies, resulting in inferior substitutes of popular drugs making their way into homes and hospitals. Hospital associations, doctors and the drug control directorate are concerned at the situation.

 Of the 340 medical companies operating in Calcutta and the districts, only 125 are ?live?. All the products of the remaining 200-odd companies are not of the highest quality, admit officers of the Directorate of Drug Control (DDC). 

 In the city and fringe areas, 100,000 prescriptions are written, accounting for sales worth Rs 1. 25 crore per day in the 2,500-plus drug stores. Every year, 100 new drug stores spring up and the nexus between the lesser-known companies and the stores strengthens. 

 In Calcutta, according to DDC officials, there are over 8,000-10,000 frontmen licence-holders in the wholesale medicine business. ?Neither the distributor nor the retailer realises that the young men with the pack of medicines do not have any idea about the composition or quality,? said a deputy drug controller.

 In Calcutta, cheaper substitutes of most antibiotics and heart ailment medicines are readily available, and pharmacies, induced by substantial cuts from lesser-known companies for pushing their products, have no hesitation in switching a higher-quality drug with a cheaper substitute.

 If antibiotics like ceftriaxome sodium and cefuroxime axetil are regularly switched, there are many substitutes of paracetamols manufactured by multinationals. 

 Even multi-vitamin Becosules are substituted by cheaper alternative drugs.

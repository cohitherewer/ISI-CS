 Twilight games

 In a society denuded of family values, aged parents often suffer from lack of love and care from their grown-up children. Exploring with gentle sympathy and compassion the helplessness and insecurity felt by senior citizens, Aparanher Alo also shows them the way to counter their problems. Having reached the twilight of their lives, three friends, Akshay, Bhaktibhusan and Sarbajaya, lead their lives in happy tranquillity in remote, secluded Phool Doongri, far from the din and hustle of the city. They are not married and as such they have no social obligations to fulfil. They are content to enjoy a peaceful, reclusive existence, which they find most suitable for their age. However, the pleasant rhythm of their lives is disturbed by the arrival of Anadi, who has left home after being treated badly by his son and daughter-in-law. This sets off within the group a peculiar medley of games, fun and frolic through which they help one another come to terms with the problems of old age and try to make sense of their place in an indifferent society. Direction: Dilip Basuthakur.

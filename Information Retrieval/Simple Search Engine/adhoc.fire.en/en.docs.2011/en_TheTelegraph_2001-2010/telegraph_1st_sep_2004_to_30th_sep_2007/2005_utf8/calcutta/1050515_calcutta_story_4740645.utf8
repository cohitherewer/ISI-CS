 Next weekend you can be at ... 

Similipal

 Tigers are elusive, and their numbers are dwindling fast enough to sound alarm bells. So to be on the trail of the tiger is not only being adventurous, but also sharing a worldwide concern, as we discovered on our trip to Similipal, in the heart of Mayurbhanj, Orissa. 

 It is spread over 2,750 sq km of dense tropical forest, with flora ranging from semi-evergreen to dry deciduous. Stately sal trees and Santhali women foraging for barks and twigs for firewood are quintessential images of Similipal. 

 Not many animals lurk on the forest?s periphery, but as one goes deep into Similipal, there are birds and spotted deer, and the shrill cries of cheetahs and the barking of the muntjacs reverberate in the deep jungle. From May to June, it?s orchid time at Similipal. Fox-tails are the most spectacular, with foot-long chains holding hundreds of flowers. Similipal has 87 varieties of orchids in the park. 

 Daytime temperatures are soaring, the evenings are pleasant. The ruggedness is palpable at the Ramtirtha Crocodile Rearing Centre. But only the lucky ones can sight the wild cats.

 Before you go tiger tracking, you need to be prepared. Take plenty of time and make your plans known well in advance to the field director, Similipal Tiger Reserve. There are countless salt licks that the animals frequent. Some of these ?energy reservoirs? are artificially created by forest staff.

 Similipal doesn?t encourage elephant rides, despite a large number of tuskers. But there are other attractions ? a large population of sambar, spotted deer and wild boar.

 Then, there are the waterfalls. The spectacular Barhipani falls, with a drop of 400 m, was one of the reasons we checked into the Barhipani Falls View log cabin.

 This is the richest watershed area of Orissa and perennial rivers like Buddha Balanga, Khadke, Khairi-Bhandan, Salandi and Sanjo flow through it, re-creating a water spectacle.

 Don?t forget your entry permits. Also, do not expect top-end jungle hospitality in Similipal, though you can be assured of comfortable bungalows, hygienic food, clean toilets and breathtaking views. 

 The terrain is demanding and one could lose track of one?s game trail, thanks to the wayside attractions.

 It is advisable to go to Similipal through a tour operator. There are outdoor adventure management training and lectures on star-gazing to ornithology. Similipal today represents something of an energy reservoir for visitors. 

 Going: 

 By road, Similipal is 220 km. By rail, Balasore is six hours. Then, another 56 km by road

 Staying: 

 The park is open for tourists from November 1 to June 15. Reservation at the Forest Rest Houses and lodges, in person or by post (30 days in advance). Or book through a tour operator like Silent Valley Wilderness Tours (14/1 Karaya Road, 22802893/7811, silentvalleycamphotmail.com). The two-night-three-day package costs Rs 3,000 per person, inclusive of accommodation and safari

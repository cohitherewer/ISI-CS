The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 I was shocked to find that the floor of a covered rickshaw that carries schoolchildren 

was made of planks of wood tied together with wires. There were gaps between the 

planks ? big enough for a kid to stick his/her foot out. In the process of wriggling 

the limb back in, the kid might get hurt. Why don?t guardians check the vehicles 

that they hire to transport their children to and from school? Fortunately, some 

of the covered rickshaws are of sturdy built and are safe if the rickshaw-puller 

follows road rules. 

 S.S. Almal, 

Lower Rawdon Street. 

 A stretch of the footpath along Vivekananda Road (approach road to Maniktala 

police station) was dug up by CESC for some repair work in mid-April. Work over, 

the trench was filled up with debris. Over the last few days, the ground at that 

spot has started caving in. Will the civic body repair it at the earliest? 

 Kalyan Ray Chaudhuri,

Maniktala. 

 ong-distance passengers who arrived at Howrah and Sealdah railway stations 

suffered a lot during the recent taxi strike. Local residents are usually informed 

beforehand about a strike. However, it is the newcomers who are caught unawares. 

The taxi associations should provide a certain number of taxis at the two railway 

stations and the airport at all times. Transport is akin to an emergency service 

to them. 

 B.N. Bose, 

Dum Dum Park. 

 Street lights in the Temple Street area are inadequate. Over the past few months 

quite a few of them have become defunct. Some others are left switched on throughout 

the day but are left unlit after sundown. The authorities should conduct monthly 

inspections. 

 Aurobindo Bose, 

Temple Street. 

 The Lake Town post office can be declared a model post office. The counters 

open on time and service is rendered always with a smile. The sincerity of the 

staff deserves praise.

 Debaprasad Mukherjee, 

Nayapatty Road. 

 On May 7, we went to watch Nishijapon at Mini Jaya. We were frequently 

disturbed by the ringing of cell phones and some people were having long conversations 

on the most trivial of topics. Strict rules should be made to restrict use of 

mobiles inside cinemas. 

 Rimli Datta, 

Salt Lake.

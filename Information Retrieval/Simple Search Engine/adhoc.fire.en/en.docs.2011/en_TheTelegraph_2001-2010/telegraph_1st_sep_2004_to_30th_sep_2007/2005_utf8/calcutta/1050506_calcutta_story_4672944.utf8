 Infertility in adults, growth halt in kids 

 - ALARMING SPURT IN LEAD POISONING

 JAYANTA BASU 

 A four-month-old, fed on breast milk, develops complications like anaemia and retardation of body growth. Lead poisoning is found to be the cause, and the source is the mother?s metal ring, which the baby often bites

 The husband is a middle-aged executive, the wife a socialite. The husband complains of a host of health problems that are all traced to lead poisoning. The cosmetics used by the wife are identified as the cause

 Lead poisoning, almost unreported in the city even five years ago, is now threatening to turn into an epidemic. And the factors responsible for its rapid spread are changing lifestyle, poor personal hygiene and foul air.

 ?Till 2001, we virtually had no patients. But the situation changed dramatically over the past few years,? says Krishnajyoti Goswami, associate professor of biochemistry at Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratishthan and director of the state chapter of National Referral Centre for Prevention of Lead Absorption in India.

 ?Around 50 patients with lead poisoning symptoms are now being referred to us annually. Almost half of them have lead content in blood above the permissible limit, which is 10 microgram per decilitre,? Goswami elaborated.

 According to Thuppil Venkatesh, head of the National Referral Centre for Prevention of Lead Absorption in India, around 51 per cent of children below 12 years in Calcutta carry more than permissible lead in their blood.

 The findings are from Project Lead-Free ? launched in 1997 across seven Indian cities ? that covered around 22,000 children and adults.

 According to experts, the mental and physical growth of children with high lead content in blood is severely affected. ?Lead poisoning can persist through adulthood and may be irreversible,? said an expert.

 Another city-based study, covering 370-odd males between 24 and 55 years, shows that lead concentration in around 50 per cent of males is 10 microgram or more. ?The rise in the level of lead is causing a corresponding rise in infertility and irritability among adults and a drop in IQ among children,? the experts added.

 ?There is no doubt that the rate of infertility is on the rise and the role of environmental pollutants, including lead, cannot be ruled out,? observed gynaecologist S.M. Bhattacharya. 

 ?Patients from fringe areas like Sonarpur, Baruipur and Canning are suffering more from lead poisoning because of their dependence on low-cost cosmetics, which are rich in lead,? he added.

 ?Even ayurvedic medicines, food additives and cow milk have been found to be contaminated with lead. Lead-based paints have been banned in developed countries, but no restriction has been imposed on their use in India... Recently, nine out of the 10 samples of turmeric powder in the city were found to contain significant amount of lead,? says Venkatesh.

 A study among traffic cops pinpointed Calcutta?s environment as a principal factor for the spread of lead poisoning. The study, by the National Referral Centre for Prevention of Lead Absorption, revealed that carboxyhaemoglobin value (which indicates the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood) rises significantly among policemen during duty hours.

 Experts blame continuous intake of lead from air for the rise in the carboxyhaemoglobin value. The element tends to replace the iron in the body and, in turn, reduces the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood.

 ?You have about 2,000 landmines in the city,? warns Venkatesh, indicating areas in the city where either lead smelter units or battery dismantling units are located.

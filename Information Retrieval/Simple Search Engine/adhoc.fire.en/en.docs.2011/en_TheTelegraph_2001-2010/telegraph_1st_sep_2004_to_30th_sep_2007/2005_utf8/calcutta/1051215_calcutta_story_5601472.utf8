 Less than 24 hours left for the settlers at Gobindapur rail colony to leave, the administration on Wednesday resolved doing everything possible to ensure the process was not tainted with blood.

 Senior officers of the city police and their counterparts in South 24-Parganas met with Government Railway Police (GRP) top brass at Lalbazar and agreed on a blueprint for peaceful implementation of the Calcutta High Court order on vacating the colony.

 Police, sources said, would try not to force out a single individual but would ensure not one stays back. A tact-force mix is what officers will apply on the settlers, from eight in the morning till midnight. 

 In keeping with this strategy, the officers decided to increase the number of camps from five to seven and to work closely with GRP and the Sangram Committee.

 ?From Friday, police will start demolishing the structures. If anyone refuses to leave, we will evict him/her,? asserted Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters). 

 Till Wednesday, police records revealed, around 1,400 of the 2,729 settler families have collected token certificates, that will help them in the rehabilitation process. The rest are expected to do so by Thursday midnight.

 ?If there is any discontent, we will try to explain that we are only following a court directive,? said N.R. Babu, deputy commissioner (south). 

 Murmurs of discontent were, however, palpable in the colony on Thursday. ?The space in Nonadanga cannot accommodate all of us. Where will the rest go?? wondered Anil Majhi, a settler. 

 ?Have you been there? The place has nothing. How can we live there?? asked Aparna Das.

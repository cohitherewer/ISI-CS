 Lift overhaul for CM smooth ride

 SIMI KAMBOJ

 The chief minister won?t have to walk up the stairs of Writers? Buildings for much longer. 

 The public works department (PWD) has decided to ?thoroughly overhaul? the VIP elevator that Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee uses about four times a day. The elevator had tripped thrice in the past week, forcing the chief minister to take the stairs or the general lift to reach his first-floor chamber.

 ?Some accessories in the VIP elevator are malfunctioning, due to which the doors are not closing properly. The manufacturer is on the verge of bankruptcy and cannot provide us spare parts or men to repair the lift. Hence, we have decided to go for a system overhaul,? said a senior official of PWD (electrical wing) on Wednesday.

 Tenders inviting interested parties to renovate the lift will be floated in January. The work will be taken up the next month. The project is expected to cost around Rs 20 lakh.

 ?The lift will look the same, but you will feel the difference once you board it. The ride will be smoother and more comfortable,? the official added. 

 However, Bhattacharjee will have to put up with some inconvenience before he gets to enjoy the ?smoother? ride. ?During the renovation, the chief minister and the other VIPs will have to use the general elevator near the Central Gate. This elevator, too, will be renovated in January at a cost of about Rs 15 lakh. Work orders have been issued already,? said another official of the PWD (electrical) wing. 

 The breakdowns of the VIP elevator had reportedly irked the chief minister. ?Last Thursday, after a Cabinet meeting, he complained to the PWD minister about the snags in the elevator. The day before, his private secretary summoned senior PWD (electrical) officials, to find out what was wrong with the lift,? said an official. 

 According to PWD minister Amar Chowdhury, all the four elevators in the main block of Writers? Buildings are at least 20 years old. ?Our first priority was to repair the VIP lift. We?ve now decided to renovate it totally. We?re also thinking about repairing the other three elevators. Work orders are being issued for Lift no. 1 and the general lift near the Central Gate,? he stated.

 Flagged off in 1997, abandoned in 2000. On February 26, the unfinished Kidderpore flyover received a revival prod. Now, it has been decided that construction of the flyover will resume in September.

 ?We have already invited expressions of interest from the builders to select a reputed company to which the contract will be awarded. We are in the process of shortlisting the companies and expect to complete the formalities by the end of this month. We want to start work from September without fail, and target to complete the work in two years,?? said Sadhan Banerjee, vice-chairman of Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC), the implementing agency of the flyover.

 The government had okayed the renewed Rs 34-crore project and the funds will come from the HRBC?s own coffer.

 ?We could have resumed work much earlier, had we got the government?s approval in time. We waited for about a year to get funds from the government, but our request was turned down on grounds of a financial crunch,? HRBC officials said.

 ?Later, we urged the government to grant us permission to spend the required money to complete the project. Ultimately, we got the permission but after about six months,?? they added.

 HRBC has Rs 100 crore in hand. Its source of income is collection of toll tax from Vidyasagar Setu (Rs 25 crore to Rs 30 crore a year) and recently, it has earned Rs 3 crore by selling advertisement space on the three JBIC-funded flyovers. 

 Construction of the Rs 20-crore Kidderpore flyover began in 1997 with a target to complete it by 2000. But construction was abandoned after detection of a design fault. Since 2000, the bridge has been lying half-finished, but only after about Rs 4 crore went down the drain. Later, the HRBC prepared a new design with an escalated cost of Rs 34 crore.

 The flyover will be a pre-fabricated steel structure, like the Park Street flyover, instead of the earlier concrete structure. It will take off around Fancy Market, on Garden Reach Circular Road, and come down to earth near the approach to Vidyasagar Setu. From there, commuters can take either Race Course Road or AJC Bose Road. 

 Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty said it was a shame that the government failed to build a flyover even in 10 years. He blamed the finance department for the delay in implementing the project. 

 ?What will the HRBC do if it does not get the required funds from the government? My officers and I are tired of urging the finance department to disburse funds,?? he signed off.

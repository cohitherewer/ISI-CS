The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cops in lens focus on airport artery

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Policemen manning traffic on Kazi Nazrul Islam Avenue (VIP Road) will soon be put under the scanner, with the help of closed-circuit cameras. The cameras will also track movement of VIPs along the road, to and from the airport.

 The first phase of this ambitious project got underway on Wednesday with the installation of a camera each at Baguiati and Kestopur. A control room was also set up at Baguiati to keep the stretch car crawl-free.

 ?Traffic congestion is a major problem on VIP Road, especially along the three-km stretch between Kestopur and Teghoria. However, easing traffic snarls is not our only objective. We will also be able to keep a watch through the cameras on traffic policemen on duty,? Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas) told Metro.

 He added: ?As all activities on the road will be caught on camera, we will be able to pull up officers for committing mistakes and laud them for good work.?

 The district police are planning to instal cameras along the entire length of the road. Senior officers feel this will improve the traffic flow on VIP Road considerably.

 ?With the rise in the number of flights, traffic flow to and from the airport has increased. We want to make the journey free of snarls. We are also preparing to manage VIP movement along the road more efficiently,? Kumar elaborated.

 According to the police, each camera will allow them to watch over 200 m of the road. They envisage cameras every 200 m along the eight-km stretch. 

 For now, it has been decided that a group of officers will man the control room at Baguiati. ?The cops in the control room will issue instructions to policemen deployed at various points on the road to ensure smooth flow of traffic,? explained a senior officer.

 Policemen often fail to prevent bumper-to-bumper pileups on the airport artery, one of the busiest roads in the city, with over 2,000 vehicles plying the stretch per hour at peak time. To worsen matters, the cops are missing from their posts most of the time.

 ?This project will provide us with an opportunity to study and analyse where we are going wrong,? stated another senior officer.

 Officer-in-charge of Baguiati police guard Manik Ganguly expressed satisfaction at the development. He will look after the operation of the cameras and functioning of the control room for the time being.

 ?We have started the project on an experimental basis, but we plan to broaden its scope,? said the officer-in-charge.

 Similar projects have already been undertaken at Salt Lake?s Karunamoyee and Baranagar.

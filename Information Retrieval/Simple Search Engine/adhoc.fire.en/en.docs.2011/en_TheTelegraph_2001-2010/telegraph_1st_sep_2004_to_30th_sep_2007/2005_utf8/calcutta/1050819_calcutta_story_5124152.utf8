 Teach English minus tears

 - Training course devised for primary school instructors

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Since a large number of teachers are unfamiliar with modern methods of teaching English in the lower classes, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s government has decided to launch a training course for them. 

 The project involves at least four organisations ? the state-controlled Institute of English, Calcutta University, British Council and UK-Oxford Brookes University. 

 This quartet and the school education department will in tandem implement the course, that will not only allow teachers to brush up their English but will also train them on how to present themselves while teaching the subject. 

 ?The proposed course aims at making teachers confident about their English-teaching skills,? said Suranjan Das, pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs), Calcutta University. 

 The time and date for launching the course will be finalised after Oxford Brookes University fixes its consultancy fees with the government. 

 The university has asked for nearly Rs 5,90,400 as consultancy fees for a single course that will last approximately four months. The government had initially earmarked Rs 12,75,000 for the entire course. 

 Those who teach English in state-run primary schools had very little acquaintance with the language for more than two decades. 

 Till last year, the subject was not taught at primary level, thanks to the Left Front?s government?s no-English policy. English was reintroduced in Class I only from the 2004-05 academic session.

 Before reintroducing English, the state government had organised short-term programmes for teachers so they could brush up their English. But only a small number could attend the programme.

 ?There is a dearth of good English teachers,? a senior officer of the school education department said. ?Most teachers know about communicative language teaching, but they have little idea how to put it into practice in primary classrooms,? he added.

 The involvement of Calcutta University in the scheme is significant. This is the first time in recent history that the 158-year-old university has been associated in organising a course exclusively for primary schoolteachers. 

 Oxford Brookes University is a pioneer organisation in offering quality teachers? training programmes.

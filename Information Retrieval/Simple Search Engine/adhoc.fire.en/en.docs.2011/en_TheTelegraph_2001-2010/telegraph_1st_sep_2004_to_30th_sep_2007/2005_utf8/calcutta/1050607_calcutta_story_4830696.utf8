 Elegant golf villas with a formal forecourt and easy access to the nine-hole signature course. A broad, twin-level riverfront promenade, with high-energy retail. A 15-acre industrial park and convention centre. World-class medical facilities and education?

 All this, just a 20-minute drive from New Alipore. Even as New Town, Rajarhat, continues to hog all the real estate limelight, Batanagar, home of Bata India Ltd, quietly gears up for a modern makeover. 

 One of the countrys earliest structured industrial townships, Batanagar is clearing the decks for a total urban renewal, which promises to turn it into a coveted residential rendezvous, and the initial contours of the mutation model are now emerging.

 ?We had engaged leading master planners The HOK Planning Group, St. Louise, US, for the proposed redevelopment plan and the first-flush solution is in,? Sumit Dabriwal, managing director, Riverbank Holdings Pvt Ltd, the joint-venture company with Calcutta Metropolitan Group and Bata doing the makeover, told Metro. The infrastructure planners for the project are L amp;T.

 The first part of the Rs 1,000-crore project?s vision is to transform the existing 260-acre Batanagar into a ?well-integrated mixed-use development?. Besides providing residential, commercial, non-polluting industrial, institutional and recreational facilities with an efficient infrastructure system, it will also maximise an active pedestrian riverfront environment.

 ?The second objective is to ensure regeneration of the manufacturing and support infrastructure of Bata India Ltd,? said Nandu Belani, director, Riverbank Holdings. 

 Funding will be through internal resources and borrowings. The developers hope to be on ground by this year-end and complete the township transformation in five years.

 According to the HOK master plan, the done-again Batanagar will be segmented into three distinct territories. Zone A will comprise institutional buildings, a hospital, schools, exhibition ground and retail. Zone B is earmarked for the golf community and golf course, the industrial campus with dedicated garments, building materials and IT/ITES sections, and low-density residential component. Zone C will have riverfront retail, the high-density residential component and the convention centre.

 Construction of the township dates back to 1937 and most of the staff housing is crumbling from poor upkeep. At present, 42 per cent of the 1,428 dwelling units are vacant, 32 per cent of those family accommodation in one, two, three and four-bedroom houses of varying sizes for managerial and non-managerial staff.

 ?While rehabilitating the employees into alternative residential accommodation, we will be careful so as to cause minimum dislocation and disruption,? promised Dabriwal. 

 The high-density waterfront-area residential neighbourhood will have G+3 and G+5 buildings, pedestrian-friendly streetscapes with connections to the water-focused parks and plazas. 

 ?We want to encourage intimate dialogue with the river at all levels,? he added.

 While Riverbank Holdings hopes to firm up the architect/s for the project in the next month, efforts are on to get a leading golfer to do the course. The draft land-use plan also includes a three-acre clubhouse, a contemporary school and hospital, a bus terminus over 1.35 acres, flea market, puja ground/multipurpose space and a ?well-appointed? social club.

 Water to the refurbished township will be provided from the Garden Reach Waterworks and a major portion supplied to the golf course will be used for irrigation.

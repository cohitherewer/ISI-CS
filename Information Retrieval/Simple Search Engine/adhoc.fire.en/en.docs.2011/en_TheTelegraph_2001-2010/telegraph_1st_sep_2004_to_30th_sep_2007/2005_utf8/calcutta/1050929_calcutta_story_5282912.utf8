 Theft before hotel closure

 BARUN GHOSH

 Three days before its final closure, the arrest of an employee on the charge of stealing valuables has caused considerable resentment among the 400-odd employees of the state-run Great Eastern Hotel. 

 In a notification, the authorities said all operations of the 165-year-old hotel will stop from October 1 in view of the government?s move to restructure the hotel through private participation. However, two bar-cum-restaurants, Sip-n-Bite and Maxim?s, will remain open till October 31. 

 Mohammed Islam, who has been working in the hotel?s pantry for more than 30 years, was caught by Hare Street police three days ago while stealing copper plates from the defunct solar-power electrical system. State transport minister Subhas Chakraborty had installed it during his tenure as tourism minister. The system did not work. 

 Islam, now in jail, appears set to lose all his benefits under the early retirement scheme (ERS). ?The employee concerned has to forego all his benefits admissible under the ERS,? Jagannath Bag, hotel member-secretary and chief executive officer, said on Wednesday.

 Bag, who has issued a circular warning employees against such thefts, said departmental proceedings had been initiated against the accused. ?The theft of valuables from the hotel is really a sad development before its final closure. The copper plates are quite precious and we have brought it to the notice of Calcutta Police so that thefts do not recur,? he said, adding: ?The government has taken a serious view of it, as the hotel has a number of antiques.? 

 However, the Intuc-controlled Great Eastern Hotel Staff and Workers? Association and the CPM-led Staff and Employees? Union are not happy with the treatment meted out to an old employee for his alleged involvement in a theft case. ?To deny him retirement benefits is too harsh a step,? said Atiar Rahaman, general secretary of the association.

 The hotel?s employees are uncertain about the payment of their dues under the ERS. ?Though the hotel is being officially shut from Saturday, we don?t know when we shall get the ERS dues. We request the authorities to pay us the benefits by October 31,? Rahaman said.

 Hotel member-secretary Bag said employees will get their dues in November. 

 ?We shall select a venue from where employees can collect their ERS dues by November 11. We have earmarked over Rs 15 crore for payment of ERS benefits to 420 employees, including 54 casual workers?, he added.

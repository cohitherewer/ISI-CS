The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Recently, I happened to enter Victoria Park on Rawdon Street. The park is to be revamped after construction of a boundary wall around it by Calcutta Municipal Corporation, using Asian Development Bank funds. It seems the pace of the work is extremely slow. A few unauthorised structures have also come up along the waterbody there. Also, why is garbage being allowed to accumulate in and around Victoria Park? Why isn?t the tank kept clean?

 On June 6, the ceiling fan in one of the rooms in Asutosh College?s new hostel fell on one of the inmates, a student of English Honours. His Part I examinations were to begin the next day. When the boy was taken to SSKM Hospital, the authorities refused to admit him without a letter from the college. He is presently at his aunt?s, undergoing treatment. The incident has set off a scare in the hostel where around five to six students stay in a room. The new hostel doesn?t have a proper bathroom either. The food is below standard. The college must take up the responsibility of safety and welfare of the students staying in its hostels.

 Of late, I have to make frequent visits to AMRI Hospitals from Sarsuna. Though I always follow the same route, taxis charge me anything between Rs 109 and Rs 170 for every trip. I observed that the fare doesn?t necessary depend on the traffic situation. On being questioned, the caustic taxi drivers urge me to lodge complaints against them with the police as they are certain that the cops would do nothing. Also, the cabbies queueing up in the vicinity of the hospital are reluctant to go to Sarsuna.

 Biren Roy Road (West). 

 Every summer, before the onset of the monsoon, Barrackpore Trunk Road under Dunlop bridge is dug up and a huge crater remains for weeks. As a result, vehicles only have room to move in a single file. This causes a massive traffic jam during rush hours every day. Can something be done to avoid this?

 Sarbeswar Nayak,

 Bentinck Street. 

 I purchased a few cassettes and CDs of Tagore songs sung by well-known singers. To my dismay, I found that the tunes and the tempo of the numbers have been drastically changed. It was almost like a bad remix. How do the artists and connoisseurs tolerate such distortion? 

 Pijush Banerjee,

 Sarsuna.

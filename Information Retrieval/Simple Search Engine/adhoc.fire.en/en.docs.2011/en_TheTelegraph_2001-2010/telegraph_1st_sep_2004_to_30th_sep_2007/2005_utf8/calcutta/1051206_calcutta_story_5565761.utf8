Bitter truth

Screen On amp; Off

 Neem is bitter but the bitter makes it better/so lets try beta/to make our lives a bit better ? if these lines remind you of the old nursery rhyme about Betty and her bitter butter, it?s part of the message-with-a-smile mission. And it?s from no ordinary messenger either.

 Mouthing these lines is Jaya Bachchan. Starting next week you can see the reticent Bachchan spreading the N-word among a group of kids seated in the shade of a neem tree (?where it is always 10 degrees cooler!?).

 This is one of six 30-second campaigns to be launched on STAR channels by the Mumbai-based Neem Foundation. Established in 1993, the foundation has really stepped up promotional activity with the Greening India with Neem project. Getting recognition for the ecological and medicinal values of this ?Indian plant? and in the process channelising the growing environmental concern to positive action, is its aim.

 Neem trees from two to 10 crore (i.e. one neem tree per 10 Indians) is their goal. The Neem Foundation?s venture won the nod from the normally reclusive actress who is as picky and choosy about her screen appearances as her husband is not.

 ?It is an indigenous plant and Indians are forgetting all about it,? says Jaya.

 The other five Neem promos find her explaining how farmers need not commit suicide just because their lands are barren or there is a drought. They can instead plant neem trees whose deep roots make it hardy enough to withstand super cyclones and whose seeds have commercial value in making an effective and eco-friendly pesticide.

 Yet another slot finds her singing, ?Kabhi neem neem, kabhi shahed shahed? the Abhishekh Bachchan-Rani Mukherjee number from Yuva. And mama Bachchan says neem can never be honey, but its bitterness is a valuable truth.

 Notice slap for building law breach

 A STAFF REPORTER

 To check illegal constructions on rooftops and unauthorised renting out of terraces, the civic authorities have decided to slap notices on buildings in Jadavpur, Behala, Santoshpur and parts of south Calcutta.

 The authorities will first try to regularise the illegal constructions against a penalty, but may demolish the structures if the infringements are found to be beyond the limit of regularisation.

 Once flats in an apartment building are sold, the buyers collectively become owners of the structure. They become responsible for illegal constructions on it or running of unlawful business on the premises, said mayor Subrata Mukherjee. 

 ?We have received a number of complaints regarding unauthorised constructions on the roof of apartment blocks or running of eateries-cum-bars on terraces of commercial buildings. The practice must be stopped,? he added.

 The civic authorities have decided to take up the matter with the housing board before drafting an amendment to the civic building rules.

 ?The trend of unauthorised constructions in apartments and promoters letting out roofs can be checked if it is made mandatory for plot-owners to submit an undertaking that they will cease to enjoy any special right to the roof after the construction,? said mayoral council member (building) Swapan Samaddar. 

 According to director-general (building) Ashok Roychaudhury: ?As per the Calcutta Municipal Corporation building rules, it is not the promoter who has the final say in a construction proposal. He is nothing but a temporary agent, contractor and broker of the landlords. Building construction proposals are processed and sanctioned in the name of the plot-owners.? 

 It is common practice among promoters or landlords to retain rights to the roof even after the flats in a building are sold. But such a practice is illegal, asserted deputy chief law officer Shaktibrata Ghosh.

 ?A flat-owner does not only purchase a limited carpet area; he purchases a proportionate share of the plot, including the vacant space, super-built area and the roof. Hence, the flat-owners in a building become the owners of the plot,? Ghosh explained.

 ?Permission is required from all of them for subsequent construction work or for letting-out of the premises for commercial purposes,? civic deputy chief law officer Ghosh signed off.

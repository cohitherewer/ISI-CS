 Movie mission: A few good men to man edit table

 The machines are there, but not the hands to man them. ?It has pinched us for a long time that we have not been able to create the technical resources in the city,? says Rabiranjan Maitra, editor of films such as the under-production Aparna Sen production 15 Park Avenue and Bengal?s digital debut Nil Nirjane. 

 Maitra was speaking at the launch of a course on non-linear editing at Digital Academy, the four-month-old city chapter of a Mumbai institute. 

 ?The B amp;W film laboratories here never planned for upgradation, leave alone going colour. So when colour films arrived and the government set up Rupayan, hardly any local hands could be found. In contrast, Madras Film School had a course in printing technology and it is from Chennai that most of Rupayan?s technicians came. We should take a lesson from that experience,? he said.

 Filmmaker Gautam Ghose too was present to welcome the effort. ?We need technicians who can work on a digital platform,? he concurred.

 The academy already runs two courses, in animation and visual effects. The three-month training, starting June 6, will cost Rs 24,499. ?Two batches have already enrolled. We will provide them exposure to the latest editing platforms,? said Arvind Chopra of the academy.

 In comparison to the two-year courses offered at the SRFTI or the FTII, Pune, three months may seem too short. But Maitra, a Pune graduate, has an answer. ?Students with a passion for films go to film schools. They spend a year learning the basics of cinema. I have seen those enrolled for technical subjects like sound engineering get frustrated having to spend time watching films or shooting. In a short-term course, one comes looking for a profession. As one learns the craft, the interest in cinema is grinded into them.?

 ?Such a compact course will also be of use to linear editors who want to pick up the non-linear system,? Ghose added.

 Rupam Majumdar, an ex-student of Quality Cine Lab, India?s only authorised training centre for the editing software Avid, is taking charge as faculty. ?Such is the state here that caretakers of yesterday have become editors today. This is resulting in myriad technical problems, be it in colour temperature and audio level or by leaving digital glitches in pictures.? The reason, he explained, is that the people had picked up the work by watching others and lack a technical background. 

 ?The experts cannot be there to check on assistants all the time,? Majumdar said, adding he himself could do with a couple of trained assistants for his independent assignments.

 light of a century: Howrah station in makeover decor. Picture by Pradip Sanyal 

 The complexities of modern life are increasing the gap between generations, and the elderly are getting isolated as a result (Interact with aged, learn to care for kin, November 19). So much so that harmonious relationship between members of a family has become a thing of the past. 

 These days, young couples prefer to live on their own after marriage. The bride, thus, does not get a chance to be properly acquainted with her in-laws. 

 The parents of the couple are often neglected and forced to lead lonely lives. Their children are even prevented from forging a relationship with the grandparents, quite a few of whom are left with no option but to seek shelter in old-age homes. 

 Monetary matters also play an important part in this dissolution of relationships. The aged, who are neglected at home but do not have the means to move out, are the worst sufferers. 

 What the young forget is that they too will one day grow old and their children might treat them in the same manner. The kids of today are taught neither to respect the elderly nor care for them, so they can hardly be faulted for their actions then. They will merely be following the footsteps of their parents. 

 Some schools have thankfully taken the initiative to teach boys and girls how to behave with old people. The Helping Hands project aims to instil the right values among children and help them maintain good relations with Generation-Ex. 

 The training, if conducted properly, will leave a lasting impression on young minds, and enable them to enjoy the affection of their grandparents. 

 This is also the best way of preventing old people from sinking into depression. More schools should start such programmes as people do not easily forget what they learn in childhood. 

 Such attempts are nothing short of social reform and will ultimately bring about improvement of the system. Through the programmes, the kids will learn to love old people and might even convince their parents to take better care of their grandparents. Harmonious familial relationship is just one possible offshoot of this noble endeavour. 

 Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

 Behala. 

 Apropos the report ?Sunshine rerun at Howrah station?, No vember 28, the area around Howrah station is filthy. I have been to Mumbai?s Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, Chennai?s Central Station and the main rail stations of Bangalore, Lucknow and Allahabad. All their surroundings are a lot cleaner. 

 With the Howrah station building celebrating its centenary, the approach to the landmark must be given a sophisticated and pleasant look. Of late, snacks stalls to hooch vendors have taken over the area. There are even complaints of prostitution. The time is rife to turn a new leaf. 

 B.N. Bose,

 Dum Dum. 

 Apropos the report ?Entry fee debut at Botanical Gardens?, November 18, the decision by the garden authorities to impose an entry fee, in compliance with the directives of the high court, is welcome. The fee should have been introduced much earlier to recover some of the maintenance expenditure. 

 But why should a distinction be made between Indian and foreign visitors? Will the Indians have to carry identity cards to prove their nationality? And is there a guarantee that foreigners won?t be allowed in for Rs 10 when there are no Indians around? The move might also hurt the sentiment of tourists from abroad, who are, after all, our guests. 

 Biman Saha,

 Lake Town. 

 It is unfair that visitors to the Botanical Gardens will have to pay an entry fee from now on. The authorities should have looked to improve the amenities for visitors before introducing the fee. 

 Prahlad Agarwala, 

 Majdia, Nadia. 

 Apropos the report ?Buddha revamps safety roadmap?, November 24, it is wonderful that the state government is taking an initiative to improve the traffic management system of Calcutta. But it should first instruct the traffic department to be stricter with drivers, as they are responsible for most of the mishaps. The pedestrians are forced to walk on the roads as the pavements have been taken up by hawkers. 

 Sourish Misra,

 Salt Lake. 

 It is most unbecoming of the traffic department to try and fix the blame for road mishaps on pedestrians. It is true that some people walk on the road with little regard for rules, but they cannot account for the majority of the accidents in the city. 

 There are many reasons behind the mishaps. Defunct traffic signalling systems and lack of road repair are two of the main ones. Besides, there is hardly any footpath left in the city for pedestrians. The number of traffic cops, too, is far from adequate. 

 The Motor Vehicles Department is perhaps the biggest contributor to the rise in the number of accidents. It is corrupt and issues licences indiscriminately on payment of hush money. 

 Arindam Basu, 

 Bisharpara. 

 The traffic police are quick to point out the mistakes made by pedestrians, but can they locate a pavement in the city, where one can walk freely for more than two minutes? Also, what actions do they take when conductors force passengers off buses in the middle of roads? 

 Anup Gadodia, 

 Amar Basu Sarani. 

 The pedestrians cannot be blamed for getting off buses in the middle of roads. They can?t get off, unless the buses stop in the middle of roads. Bus bays are unlikely to solve the problem. Heavy fines are the only way out. Something should also be done to make buses and cars stop at zebra crossings, which have become meaningless in our country. 

 Kabita Roy, 

 Howrah. 

 Reckless pedestrians are responsible for many an accident. The return of the Rs 50-fines would act as a deterrent for habitual violators of road rules. 

 Abul Fateh Kamruddin, 

 Hooghly. 

 The report ?Faces fall with wickets?, November 26, captured the mood shift at the Eden Gardens with South Africans overcoming the Indians with ridiculous ease. The crowd, taken aback by needless experimentation on part of the home team, resorted to barracking. 

 Sunil Banerjee,

 VIP Road. 

 Apropos the report ?Big screen beckons again?, November 12, the film festival is an integral part of the bustling cultural calendar of the city. Its scope should be expanded in the years to come. 

 Dalim Kumar Datta,

 APC Road.

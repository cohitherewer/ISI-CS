 Wow your walls 

 Scottish checks, funky graffiti, texturing, rustic charm or gold leafing mdash; all 

 these can find their rightful place, discovers Shradha Agarwal

 HOUSE PROUD

 Mirror, mirror on the wall is facing huge competition. Not from the fairest of them all, but from the wall itself! Gone are the stark whitewashed days that could give any toothpaste ad a run for its smile. Also pass? is the creams or peaches look. Its time to bid adieu to the one bright wall phase too, as walls these days are being dressed up like never before.

 Scottish checks, Verdigris, rough textured, stripes, crazy graffiti, gold leafing, antique? the choices are endless and your walls and ceilings can almost resemble a go-as-you-like fancy dress show.

 Wall effects could well be the perfect solution to fill in the blank ? when a painting is not what youre looking at and a vibrant turquoise stretch isnt exactly your style. These effects come in a variety of form and finery.

 GoodLife presents three distinct looks to suit your space and style.

 Minimal mode

 ean, straight lines with no frills in the form of carvings and intricacies attached, the minimalist no-fuss look still finds many takers. And if this look soothes your sensibilities then maybe you can also introduce some subtle drama through your walls. 

 The neo-classical look appears very nice in the minimalist mode. It primarily deals with tone-on-tone design effects, says Jaya Chatrath of Perfect Finish, wall and furniture effects specialists. Minimalist walls essentially revolve around light hues though one can sometimes introduce deeper hues to complement the rest of the d?cor. 

 Samir Ladsaria of Wall Texture recommends the wallpaper effect, going perfectly with the no-fuss feel. A plain matte colour as a background with smart patterns hand-printed or painted looks very chic, says Samir. 

 Interesting tools such as sea sponge or spatula can be used here, with the towel-finish look also a popular option. According to Samir, another idea to suit this style is Stucco, which gives a marble finish. It has a very glassy effect and is so smooth and slippery that water can easily run off it, he adds.

 According to Payal Sawhney, Jayas partner at Perfect Finish, smart stripes, checks, checker boards and Verdigris look great, too. We can also take a stencil pattern and choose two hues. Alternate the design for a positive and negative effect and repeat it through, explains Payal.

 Ornate appeal 

 Ornate wall designs go extremely well either with an area that is very dressy or to contrast with a seemingly simple space. The trick to achieve an opulent look lies in choosing the right colours and theme.

 Silver and gold leafing are the most commonly used designs for a rich look, says Jaya. Prices, per sq ft, varies wildly, depending on the weight and quantity of the elements used.

 If the look required is very dense, its obviously very costly, but a lighter version isnt all that expensive, assures Payal.

 Another interesting twist is achieved by lending a distressed effect, which when worked on with metallic hues lends an old-world charm to the interiors and is very rustic indeed. Stenciling also goes well with the ornate look. Here, we paint the patterns in metallic shades, says Payal.

 According to Samir, the pearl finish appears very ornate. This effect is very nail-polish like and hence is shiny and smooth.

 Fun and flash

 From fun-filled graffiti to cute cartoon characters, from heavy-duty texturing to crazy splashes of fluorescent paint ? there is no limit to flashy wall decorations.

 While Samir suggests a bright colour wash in two shades of crimson to add funk to your homes, Payal recommends dividing a wall into four and building a pattern from the wall to the ceiling. 

 Wall defects can also be covered up by giving them a funky twist. Rough texturing, some freehand painting, a game of knots-and-crosses are some other fun formulas. We can also create the lapis lazuli or the malanite stone effect or give an illusion of cracks, says Jaya.

 The most creative and the easiest route to acquire a funk-filled wall would be to have a graffiti party ? just dont time it before your home is due for a paint job.

 Bare basics

 While your natural tendency would be to concentrate on a single wall, leaving the others bare, all for that dazzling effect, Payal does not quite regard this as a thumb rule. One wall could be the focal point in a room, but an L-shaped design will also look just as good. In fact, if the furniture permits, you could also decorate all the four walls of your room.

 Wall designing is all about balancing the act. Other than managing the visual balance, wall effects can go a long way in complementing or contrasting the rest of your room d?cor. Paisleys or stripes from your upholstery could be incorporated into your wall designs, suggests Payal.

 The maintenance is simple ? all you need is a wet piece of cloth to wipe the walls clean. Though you should avoid harsh soaps and chemicals, these walls really dont need too much pampering. Touch-ups arent advisable for these walls since they end up in patches.

 And, finally, before you select a theme, interior designer Ajay Arya suggests a thorough study of the colours and patterns.

 Whether you want to contrast a certain look or complement the existing feel, the texture, design and colour combinations should form the basic theme for your wall effects, explains Arya.

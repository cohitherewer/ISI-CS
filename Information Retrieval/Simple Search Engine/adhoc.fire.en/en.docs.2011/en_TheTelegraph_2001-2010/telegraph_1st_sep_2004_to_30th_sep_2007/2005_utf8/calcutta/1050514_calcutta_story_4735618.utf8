 Glut forces lab to refuse samples

 KINSUK BASU

 Unable to handle the number of samples being sent for examination every day and with no place to dump those that have been examined, the state?s only forensic laboratory, in Belgachhia, has shut its doors to the police. 

 Police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee has been briefed about the situation and a message has been sent to all police stations asking the officers-in-charge not to send viscera for examination, even if the test is crucial for a case, for the time being.

 The laboratory authorities, groping for ways to handle the crisis, have shot off a letter to home secretary Amit Kiran Deb seeking his intervention. 

 ?With the new rules on handling bio-medical waste coming into force, it has become difficult for the laboratory to dispose of the viscera that have already been examined. We have no space to accommodate new samples,? said Dhurjati Sengupta, assistant director (toxicology) of the laboratory. 

 Scientists working at the laboratory said it was impossible for outsiders to comprehend the situation. 

 Nearly 1,500 jars of examined samples cannot be disposed of, while 4,000 samples are in the queue for the test,? they added. 

 ?Even in cases of accidental deaths, doctors are not willing to take chances, fearing complaints to the human rights commission. They send viscera for examination even if it is not a must. The number of viscera reaching the laboratory from the districts is also very high,? said a senior scientist of the laboratory. 

 As in the past, this year, too, the laboratory officials had initially fallen back on the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) to help them dump the examined viscera samples.

 When the CMC pleaded helplessness, the laboratory officials sought help from the pollution control board. 

 After rounds of deliberations, the board informed the laboratory about a Howrah-based agency, which has been authorised to handle biological waste like viscera samples. 

 ?The agency carried out a survey on Thursday and we are now waiting for an official offer from the agency,? said assistant director Sengupta.

 ?It would cost the laboratory around Rs 40,000 to dump the samples through the agency. We are looking for ways to ensure that we receive the necessary funds from the state government,? he added. 

 But the experience of this year has acted as an eye-opener. To prevent recurrence of a similar situation, laboratory officials have started lobbying to ensure that in future, police send viscera samples only for examination and not just for verification.

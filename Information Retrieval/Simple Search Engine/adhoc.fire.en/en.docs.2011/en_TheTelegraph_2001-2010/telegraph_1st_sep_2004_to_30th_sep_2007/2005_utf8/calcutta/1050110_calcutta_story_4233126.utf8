 Large-format condominium complexes are in, standalone properties out. The average age of the Calcutta home-seeker is no longer 45-plus, but more like 25-30. With easy availability of home finance and the spiral in the number of double-income families in town, the buyer profile is changing by the day as more and more young couples go house hunting in earnest.

 Property Fair 2005, presented by Credai (Confederation of Real Estate Developers? Association of India), Bengal chapter, at the Ice Skating Rink (January 7-10), has seen a ?filtered footfall? unlike the more ?general crowd? at the Maidan show last September. A large chunk of the walk-ins comprised young professionals in the age group of 20-30, the organisers maintain.

 ?We have had over 1,000 enquiries, with the maximum interest shown in the Rs 15-30 lakh product bracket,? says Amit Jain, senior manager, marketing, of real estate agents N.K. Realtors, showcasing 35 properties at the housing exposition.

 Jain feels the demand for sprawling formatted projects is on the rise with customers valuing the comprehensive basket of amenities, attractive landscaping and exhaustive safety and security measures that smaller properties find difficult to match.

 Both South City and Sherwood Estate, two high-profile mega-scale properties on display, hope to generate sales of 100 apartments each, following up leads from the four-day expo. There are 36 stalls hawking more than 100 projects valued at over Rs 1,000 crore. The organisers expect a total turnout of 20,000.

 ?We had more than 60 applications, but this venue couldn?t hold more than 36 stalls and we are hamstrung as Netaji Indoor Stadium is under repair and unavailable,? says Credai-Bengal secretary Pradip Chopra. The developers? body has now decided to roll out four property expos every year to meet the demand ? ?one big-bang show and three smaller ones?.

 Most city developers find this interface with buyers and financial institutions a happy hunting ground. ?With the cost of advertising becoming prohibitively expensive by the day, this provides the best platform for us to showcase our products,? observes Sushil Mohta, managing director, Merlin Group, and vice-president, Credai-Bengal.

 The home-seeker, too, sees value in the mortar mart. ?At a glance, we can see all the buildings coming up and speak to the promoters and financiers under one roof. This way, the transactions remain transparent and we can pick and choose from a wide array of options,? says Dipak Bhotika, visiting the fair on Sunday.

 The bankers, too, are happy with the response. ?We are confident of meeting over 60 per cent of our target business, and condominium projects seem to be the flavour of the season. There?s also a healthy interest in Rajarhat,? says Manoj Kumar Das of HSBC.

 Projects in New Town have evinced a steady stream of enquiries. ?We have already sold 30 brochures for the HIG segment and blocked 13 townhouses at the fair,? says a representative of Hiland Woods, a joint-venture three-tier residential complex coming up in Rajarhat?s Action Area II.

 Bungalows are in, as is evident from the throngs at the stalls of the Sanjeevani Group and the Space Group, both coming up with bungalow projects in Rajarhat. 

 ?This buoyancy in the market translates into a contribution of over Rs 1,500 crore to the state exchequer every year in the form of stamp duty only,? says Chopra.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Eagle eye on rail ticket racket

 RADHEYSHYAM

RADHEYSHYAM, divisional railway manager of Sealdah, met readers 

of The Telegraph at his office last week to answer their queries. Participants 

included Jitendranath Das, Parvez Akhter, S.H. Khan, Swapan Bharati, Diptimoy 

Ghosh, Chandan Dey, Aparesh Bhattacharya, Mir Adam Rahim, Md. Imdaduddin, Sandip 

Banerjee and Smriti Bhattacharjee

 Swapan Bharati: Can one buy a combined monthly ticket that can be used to commute by the surface railway as well as the Metro and Circular railways?

 No, we do not have tickets that can be used to avail of the services of two different railway systems. But you can avail of the facility of multiple rail transit mode by buying separate monthly tickets.

S.H. Khan:On long-distance trains, travelling ticket examiners often take bribes to reserve berths for passengers without providing any receipt. What are you doing to counter such malpractices?

 Such incidents have come to our notice and we have started anti-fraud checks on trains to counter, and eventually, weed out criminal and corrupt activities. 

 We have also stepped up our vigilance drives so that we can keep a tab on unfair practices among our personnel. However, a section of passengers are also responsible for the rise in the number of such incidents.

Aparesh Bhattacharya: Most of the taps on the railway platforms are dry. Are you doing anything to solve the problem?

 Water and toilet facilities at the railway stations are meant for the use of bona fide passengers. 

 However, apart from the passengers, residents of shanties beside the station and along the railway tracks also utilise the facilities. They draw their drinking water from the taps on the platform. 

 Due to overuse, such services are breaking down. 

 We do repair the taps from time to time and try to maintain them, but unless unscrupulous use of the station facilities is stopped, the situation will not improve significantly.

Md. Imdaduddin: There is an open drain along the 200-m footpath between Khodar Bazar and Baruipur rail gate. The footpath is used by innumerable people to reach the station. Many of them have fallen into the drain accidentally. Can?t the drain be covered? 

 We generally do not encourage the construction of roads intersecting railway tracks, or even in close proximity of the tracks, to avoid such accidents. 

 I don?t know about this particular problem, but I will inquire about the viability of covering the drain. I must stress at the same time that it would be best if people avoid using such routes.

Sandip Banerjee: The Khardah level-crossing never closes on time, forcing local trains to halt for several minutes. Why does this happen?

 We have to keep some busy level-crossings open till the last minute to prevent traffic congestion. I feel there is no way to avoid such things. We will look into the matter to ascertain the exact cause of the delay of passenger trains. Moreover, we are building road overbridges at such level-crossings.

Md. Imdaduddin: Many local trains, specially the ones that run between 3 pm and 5 pm, do not stop at Narendrapur and Park Circus stations. Why?

 Nearly 88 EMUs on both Up and Down routes are scheduled to stop at the stations. We found that it was sufficient for a smaller number of local trains to stop at the stations.

Aparesh Bhattacharya: Several long-distance trains halt for some time before entering Sealdah station, even if the signal is green. Smugglers utilise the opportunity to unload goods. Railway and security personnel work hand-in-glove with the criminal elements. Why aren?t you doing something about this?

 We don?t know of such activities. It is a crime to not move after getting the green signal. We will look into the matter and take action.

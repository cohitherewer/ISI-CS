 Almost 60 per cent of the jute manufacturing units at Baureah have shut down 

because of labour problem. A few that are struggling to survive are facing many 

problems because of the pathetic condition of the road from Launch Ghat to the 

mills. Potholes render the stretch unusable during monsoon. Often autorickshaws 

break down in the middle of the road and worsen the situation. Good transport 

infrastructure is the one of the basic needs for any industry to flourish. Only 

if the government solves this problem will the jute manufacturing units here be 

able to survive in the tough market.

 Rice is the staple food of the people of our state. However, most types of 

rice sold in local markets have impurities despite the high price. As the commodity 

is not a luxury item, the food inspectors of the civic bodies should conduct checks 

to ensure that the rice retailers do not make profit through unfair means.

 The various organisations of photographers in the city should organise exhibitions 

on cricket and soccer, especially of pictures taken between 1940s to 1970s. This 

will help the new-generation sports-lovers to get a glimpse of the sports in the 

past golden era.

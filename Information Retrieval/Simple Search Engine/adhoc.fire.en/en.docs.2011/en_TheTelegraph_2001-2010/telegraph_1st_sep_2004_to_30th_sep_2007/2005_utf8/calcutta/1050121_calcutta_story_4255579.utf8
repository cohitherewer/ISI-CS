The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Vibrant palette colours the season

HIMIKA CHAUDHURI, ZEESHAN JAWED

After 

a month?s lull, the wedding season is about to start in full force again. And 

if you have a few invitations lined up for the next couple of months, your wardrobe 

could do with one or two ethnic additions. 

 If you swear by the classic appeal of saris, raiding the racks of Raya?s boutique at 2/1/2 Rakhal Mukherjee Road (Bhowanipore), may not be a bad idea. The new collection at designer Rinku Ghosh?s six-year-old store has all the glitz and glamour one could ask for. Raw silks, tanchoi, crepes and tussars embellished with zardosi, kantha, aari work and sequins comprise all the options required for a great Indian wedding. The vibrant palette of firoza, emerald green, maroon, red and black adds to the mood of celebration.

 Worth special mention are tanchoi silks with intricately embroidered borders and kundan and metal bead embellishments. While these are good for one of those countless side shows in a wedding, a line of heavy zardosi-embroidered silks are good for the main do.

 If subtlety is more your style, tussars with kalamkari block prints or simple printed silks and crepes provide sober options.

 ?I have tried to innovate and experiment in this collection. I really enjoyed combining tanchoi with raw silk, for example, as also using floral prints and abstract motifs at tandem,? says Rinku.

Zardosi saris, priced at around Rs 10,500, 

are by far the most expensive. Tanchois come next, which cost between Rs 

3,000 and Rs 7,000. Tussars at Rs 2,175 pinch less, while printed silks 

at Rs 1,775 and Rs 2,175 form the most economical buys of all. 

 Leather light

 This may not be the perfect time to stock up leather in your wardrobe, but at Dolphin Leathers in City Centre (Shop C111), the sales don?t seem to be dipping. The collection of jackets, handbags, purses, belts and other accessories in Italian leather and export-quality craftsmanship seem to have captured the imagination of Calcutta?s fashion conscious. 

 The most striking aspect of the collection are leather jackets in fuschia, golden yellow and bright orange, both for men and women. ?Browns and blacks are also in demand but 70 per cent of the jackets sold so far are in bright colours,? says owner Imran Zaki Siddique. Priced at Rs 3,000, frock-style jackets for women with large collars and square-shaped jackets for men are other pop picks here. 

 Dolphin Leathers has been exporting its products across the globe and has now turned its attention to the domestic retail market. ?Today, Calcuttans can buy the same quality of products as their counterparts in US or European countries where most of our product is exported,? says co-owner Asif Siddique.

 The range of ladies? handbags priced between Rs 400 and Rs 1,000 boasts a mix of vibrant colours and trendy designs on the one hand and serious black and brown office bags on the other. While men?s bags are only available in the classic colours of black and brown, they are priced at Rs 1,500 onwards.

 Some innovative gift items like card-holders and jewellery boxes besides the usual collection of organisers and mobile phone holders are on the racks too. The USP of the collection is the impeccable finish. 

 Russian romp

 Witness some Russian revelry at Polo Club in HHI. Setting the floor on fire is dancer Nourah Sahmarani from Russia, who will provide some sizzling entertainment till February end. 

 Nourah learned belly dancing in Egypt and has been dancing her way across Cyprus, Syria, Lebanon and Dubai. But India is where her heart lies. ?I find maximum admiration for my dance in India,? says Nourah. 

 She sways to Arabic and Lebanese instrumental music in costumes she designs.

 To authenticate the Russian presence at the Polo Club two new vodka-based cocktails are being served. Sexy Lady is the concoction of vodka, strawberry crush and crushed ice and Tomboy combines vodka, Kahlua and ice. Both the cocktails are priced at Rs 400.

 Music mix

 Blazing beat and pulsating rhythm will mark the Calcutta Club International Evening this Saturday, presented in association with The Telegraph. Once the inauguration formalities are through, the music will kick off in earnest with Bikram Ghosh and Tanmoy Bose taking the stage to drum up a melody or two together, with support from their respective groups.

 ?This is only the second time that the two will perform together in this format and it should be a memorable marriage of the contrasting styles of these young and dynamic musicians,? says club president Bhaskar Sen.

 Once the tabla tandem is through, Bombay Vikings of Woh chali fame will take over to regale the carnival crowd for a two-and-a-half-hour concert, after which DJ Akash will keep the dance floor warm till the early hours of Sunday.

?We expect S.S. Ray to be the chief guest, while acting 

chief justice Altamas Kabir will be the guest of honour, quot; Sen adds.

 Apart from the music, food will be the prime draw. Consulate offices of Portugal, Thailand, Chile and the Philippines have confirmed participation through dedicated food stalls offering signature dishes from their respective countries. A combined Scandinavian stall will hawk Swedish, Danish and Finnish food.

 Besides, there will be 33 food stalls with representative cuisine from different countries set up by top eateries and star hotels of the city.

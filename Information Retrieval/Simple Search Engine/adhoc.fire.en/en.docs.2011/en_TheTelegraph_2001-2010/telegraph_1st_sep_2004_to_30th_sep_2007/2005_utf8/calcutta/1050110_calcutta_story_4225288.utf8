 Rajnis Patel: Cruel death

 ?I will not get my only child back, but I know who were responsible for his death and I want to see them punished.?

 Munni Devi Patel, mother of budding cricketer Rajnis, who died at 17 after five botched surgeries, is seething a day before the reopening of the case holding five doctors responsible for the death.

 She is to be summoned to the court of Alipore sub-divisional judicial magistrate (SDJM) Manjit Singh on January 11. The last hearing of the case was held on November 24.

 Rajnis died at SSKM Hospital on June 2, 2003, after five surgeries in four months failed to set right a shinbone fracture he had suffered during a practice match.

 Orthopaedic surgeon D.K. Majumdar and junior doctors Souvik Bardhan, Sandip Manna, Jayanta Mondol and Nirmalya Basu have been accused of medical negligence and held responsible for Rajnis? death by his family.

 There are a total of 53 witnesses who are to be cross-examined by the defence and prosecution lawyers. 

 Rajnis? father Manoj, the prime witness, has already been grilled for 26 days by the defence since the case started on May 19.

 Eight weeks after he was last questioned by defence counsel, Manoj is doubtful about how his wife will face the barrage of questions that will be fired at her. 

 ?I had to face a marathon interrogation by the defence, and it was not the best experience I?ve had. It?s painful for a parent, who has lost his only child, to relive the experience over and over again,? Patel said.

 ?I told the judicial magistrate all that I had seen. We want nothing except justice, without delay,? he added.

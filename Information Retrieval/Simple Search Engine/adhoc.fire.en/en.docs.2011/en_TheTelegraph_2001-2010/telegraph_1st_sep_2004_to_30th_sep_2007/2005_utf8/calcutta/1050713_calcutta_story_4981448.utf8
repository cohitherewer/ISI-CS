 Tollywood superstar Prosenjit 

 decides to go blonde. With the rains comes this feeling 

 of lethargy, mental drainage and a sense of boredom. And 

 what better way to spruce up your life than to add some 

 colour to it, says Sharmila Singh, owner, Floras 

 beauty parlour, at 29, Lake Road, where the star had his 

 hair transformed.

 Colour lends that rejuvenated 

 feeling and choosing the shade suited for you from a wide 

 palette is essential to enhance your features and give it 

 that added glow, she adds. 

 For Prosenjit, the colour for 

 the season is LOreals ash-blonde.

 Its not completely 

 blonde but has that Indian touch, giving the colour a natural 

 flavour, explains Sharmila. Its the most 

 happening look for film stars in Mumbai as well.

 Whats more, men ? fuelled 

 by screens big and small ? are becoming experimental with 

 their hair, and colouring is all the rage right now.

 The Tollywood kings crown 

 was coloured ash-blonde, in an almost banana-style, 

 with the rest of the hair being left black. This creates 

 a brownish tinge that looks more natural.

 Holy dip turns fatal

 A STAFF REPORTER

 An early morning dip in the Hooghly on Tuesday turned into a nightmare for a tourist from Patna after his child was drowned in the river. 

 In a bid to save the boy, the man himself nearly drowned. He was saved by crew members of a passing vessel.

 According to police, Satyendra Gupta, 28, was visiting a friend in the city. At dawn on Tuesday, he decided to go to Howrah Jetty ghat with his four-year-old son Ravi for a dip in the river.

 ?Ravi insisted on accompanying me. He was very excited about seeing the river. I don?t know how he drowned. My world has collapsed,? lamented Satyendra, still in shock on Tuesday evening.

 He was holding his son?s hand as they entered the water, but lost his footing and was thrown off balance.

 ?I lost my grip on Ravi?s hand as I fell in the water,? sobbed Satyendra. 

 Picking himself up quickly, he looked everywhere for his son, but could not find the boy in the water. Panicking, Satyendra shouted for help.

 Several people were bathing in the river within earshot. They rushed to the father?s aid. But the bathers, too, failed to find the boy in the water.

 Sensing that he was losing his son forever, Satyendra jumped into the river, even though he could not swim.

 ?He just would not listen to us. We feared that he, too, would drown,? recalled eyewitnesses. 

 The crew of a passing vessel, MV Tantia, noticed the commotion on the bank. Realising something was amiss, they steered the vessel towards the bank.

 On the way, the crew noticed Satyendra struggling to stay afloat. Some of the young members immediately jumped in and pulled him out.

 ?I don?t want to live without my son. Please save him,? Gupta pleaded, as he gasped for breath.

 A search was soon started by the river traffic police, but in vain. ?It was a freak accident, that ended in tragedy,? a river traffic police officer signed off.

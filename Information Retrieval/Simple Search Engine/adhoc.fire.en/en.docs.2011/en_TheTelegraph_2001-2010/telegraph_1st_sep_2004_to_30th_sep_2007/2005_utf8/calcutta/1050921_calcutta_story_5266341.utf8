 Hilsa boon for Puja

 - Policy change boosts imports

 PRASUN BHATTACHARYA

 Thanks to decisions by the central and state governments that have made import of hilsa easier than ever before, high price and availability won?t keep you from your favourite fish this Puja.

 Till recently, hilsa importers were only issued a single-entry Sanitary Import Permit (SIP). Renewal of the SIP was mandatory to continue import of the fish.

 ?The problem with the SIP was that we had to import the permitted amount at one go. For example, if an importer had a 1,000-tonne permit, he would have to bring in the entire amount in one consignment. That was impossible, as no importer could bring in so much fish at a time,? said A.S.A. Maqsood, secretary, Hilsa Fresh Fish Importers Association.

 The association is the largest body of hilsa importers from Bangladesh. It had lobbied hard in Delhi for multiple-entry SIPs for exporters.

 ?The decision was taken about 10 days ago by the Union government. We can now import the permitted amount of fish in multiple consignments within the validity period of the SIP,? added Maqsood.

 The state government, too, has pitched in by not going ahead with a proposed 50 paise levy for a kg of imported fish. 

 ?Instead, Rs 500 is being charged as tax for each truck of imported fish. A truck can carry up to 4,000 kg of hilsa,? Maqsood elaborated. He welcomed the move. 

 The policy changes have prompted hilsa importers affiliated to the association to nearly double their import during this Vishwakarma puja.

 ?The daily import hovers around 25 to 30 tonnes at this time of the year. This year, we imported nearly 55 tonnes of hilsa from Bangladesh every day of the Vishwakarma puja week,? said Maqsood.

 So will it be an all-hilsa affair this Puja?

 ?The signs are propitious. Now, it depends on the consumers. We will be able to meet the demand if Calcuttans decide to go all-hilsa this Puja. Availability won?t be a problem,? Maqsood asserted. 

 He predicted that the prices of the fish would drop significantly during the Puja, as import is on in full swing. 

 There are, however, stumbling blocks that his association wants the government to remove soon. 

 ?Now, we can only import hilsa through the Petrapole border. In case of unrest, the border is sealed. We are trying to obtain permission to import the fish through Ghushadanga, in Basirhat, and Changrabandha, in Siliguri, in case the Petrapole border is sealed,? stated an official of the association.

 The fish imported by it comes mainly from Chandpur, Barisal, Khulna, Chittagong and Cox?s Bazar.

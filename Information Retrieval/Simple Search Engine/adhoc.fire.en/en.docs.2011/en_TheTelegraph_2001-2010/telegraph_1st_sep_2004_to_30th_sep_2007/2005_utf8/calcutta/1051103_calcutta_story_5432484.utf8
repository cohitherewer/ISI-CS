 She walks in beauty

 The sheer enjoyment of creativity by experimenting with colours and lines made Anjan Bhattacharyya enter the world of art. His works reflect his fascination for innocence, beauty and romance, both in life and nature. To be inaugurated this evening at 5, an exhibition of his recent works showcases his acute sensitivity to natural colours and fragrances. The works on show depict the artist?s profound feelings of devotion and admiration when in proximity with the pure and gentle aspects of life and nature. Endowed with a combination of reality and fantasy, his canvases portray women figures of exceptional grace and beauty, perhaps of this world, or inhabitants of the artist?s ideal abode. Yet, for all their charm, Bhattacharyya?s characters are lonely and forlorn, and often in a weary and contemplative mood. Nevertheless, the purity of their characters rings through, articulating the artist?s faith in the natural virtues of life.

 Event: An exhibition of paintings by Anjan Bhattacharyya

 When: November 3 - 10, 2 pm - 7.30 pm

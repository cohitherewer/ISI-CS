The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 We Ask You Answer

 Cough up more for hall comfort

 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Today?s question: Should multiplexes charge more than single-screen cinema halls?

Amartya Bera,

In addition to a wider choice of movies, multiplexes 

offer customers shopping malls, restaurants, parking space and air conditioners 

that work. The picture and sound quality is also much better than single screen 

theatres. Plus, owners of multiplexes have to pay higher taxes to the government. 

Hence, they have every right to charge higher than single-screen halls. 

Sohini Roy, 

 Southern Avenue

It is more comfortable to watch movies at multiplexes 

than at cinema halls. To maintain the quality of infrastructure and services, 

multiplexes need to charge higher. 

Ashok Kumar Ghosh, 

 CIT Road

Multiplexes are a cut above single-screen theatres 

in terms of technology, quality of service and ambience. Maybe, over a period 

of time, after the initial hype and hoopla dies down, the ticket prices at multiplexes 

will become more competitive.

Anjan Chatterjee, 

 Graham Road

There is no justification for multiplexes to charge 

exorbitant rates for tickets. Most good single-screen halls in Calcutta are air 

conditioned and have Dolby digital sound, but charge much less. Multiplexes are 

meant only for the rich.

K.B. Goswami, 

Central Park

The issue basically is whether the government should 

set an upper limit to prices of movie tickets. At present, there is no such limit 

and and the ticket prices are determined by market forces. It is obvious that 

the businesses of multiplexes are not suffering due to high ticket prices. Single-screen 

halls also do not lose customers when they hike ticket prices for hit movies. 

So, if the people are not complaining, why grudge multiplexes the high ticket 

rates? 

Jyoti Agarwal,

 Lake Town 

The cost of maintaining a multiplex is much higher 

than the cost of maintaining a single-screen hall, hence multiplexes have to charge 

higher from customers. In fact, single-screen halls should also increase their 

ticket prices and improve their service, if they want to survive.

T.R.Anand, 

 Budge Budge

The capacity of theatres in a multiplex are less than 

those of single-screen theatres, hence multiplexes have to charge higher to recover 

their cost of operation. We should also remember that the advent of multiplexes, 

with high ticket prices, has given off-beat movies a lifeline. 

Debasree Mukherjee,

 Address not given

It?s true that, in general, multiplexes provide more 

comfort to viewers, but what about the seats in the first few rows? Multiplexes 

definitely need to cut down on their exorbitant ticket rates.

Vinay Dokania,

 Howrah

Multiplexes should charge higher than single-screen 

halls. But the amount should not be so high that it becomes unaffordable for the 

common man. The prices currently charged at multiplexes cannot be justified in 

any way. However, it must be admitted that multiplexes have set the standard for 

single-screen halls.

Joydeep Chatterjee,

 Shyambazar

Yes, multiplexes should charge higher than single-screen 

cinemas. Not only do multiplexes offer customers greater viewing pleasure, but 

also options to shop and eat. To maintain their quality of service, multiplexes 

need to charge higher than single-screen halls.

Kanai Saha,

 Gouri Bari Lane 

Single-screen halls cannot be compared with multiplexes, 

which offer better services, digital sound and high-quality visuals. The higher 

ticket prices of the multiplexes are justified.

B.N. Bose, 

 Dum Dum

The service and extra facilities that multiplexes 

provide over single-screen theatres do not justify the difference in ticket prices. 

The government should fix an upper limit to ticket prices at multiplexes. 

Saptadipa Ghosh,

 Bhadreshwar

Multiplexes offer a complete entertainment package 

to viewers, consisting of not just movies, but wonderful ambience and good food. 

They should charge higher.

Satyen Biswas,

 Behala

It is bad practice on the part of multiplex owners 

to charge exorbitant rates for tickets. The government should immediately take 

action against them. 

Sukanta Pachal,

 Howrah

No one is foolish enough to pay without getting anything 

in return. Despite higher prices, people are flocking to multiplexes because they 

are getting better service in return.

R.N. Sengupta,

 NSC Bose Road

Profitability is the most important aspect of any 

business. Those who have invested huge sums of money to build multiplexes with 

the best of facilities in posh localities, will charge high prices for tickets 

and target people with higher disposable income. Those who can?t afford such high 

ticket prices should visit single-screen cinema halls.

Naren Sen,

 Ramrajatala

Ticket prices at multiplexes should be reduced so 

that people from all walks of life can enjoy movies there. At present, only people 

with plenty of disposable income can afford to visit multiplexes. 

Chandan Ray,

 Sakuntala Park

It is obvious that multiplexes will charge higher 

since they offer better service. However, much of the charm of watching cinema 

has been lost due to the multiplexes, which treat films like a commodity. In the 

interest of cinema, the government should take steps to ensure that single-screen 

theatres do not close down.

Dalim Kumar Datta,

 APC Road

Multiplexes all over the country, and not just in 

Calcutta, charge higher ticket rates than single-screen theatres. The reason they 

haven?t reduced rates is that the high ticket prices haven?t deterred customers 

from visiting multiplexes. Better service and higher taxes also justify the high 

ticket prices to an extent.

Kalyan Kumar Ghosh,

 Baguiati

The kind of services that multiplexes offer does not 

justify their ticket prices, unless one considers being shown the seat by English-speaking 

ushers a special kind of service. One should remember that the food sold at multiplexes 

are also priced exorbitantly. To justify the ticket prices at multiplexes on the 

ground that they offer more options is silly.

Atif Ayaz,

 Serampore

Multiplexes and cinema-halls offer different kinds 

of services and target different classes of people. While cinema halls are meant 

for middle-class people, multiplexes try to attract people from the upper class. 

Hence, the higher ticket rates at multiplexes are quite natural.

Ronita Dutta,

 Jadavpur

There is wide gulf in quality of service between multiplexes 

and single-screen halls. Hence, multiplexes can charge higher ticket prices. As 

long as cinema halls lack even the basic facilities, multiplexes will not feel 

the need to bring down their prices.

Sandip Banerjee,

 Harish Mukherjee Road

Multiplexes can charge higher ticket prices than single-screen 

theatres if they provide a wider choice and better service to viewers. Single 

screen halls should follow the lead taken by the multiplexes if they want to survive.

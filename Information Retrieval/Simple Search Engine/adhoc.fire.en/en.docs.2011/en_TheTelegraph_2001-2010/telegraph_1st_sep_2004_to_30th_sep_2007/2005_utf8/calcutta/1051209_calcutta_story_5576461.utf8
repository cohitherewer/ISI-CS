 Mother custody vs father kidnap

 - Fallout and abduction later, sons returned to housewife by court order

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 After a lengthy battle marked by dramatic twists and turns, Calcutta High Court on Thursday awarded Sukanya Das permanent custody of her two sons.

 Sukanya, a housewife, has been engaged in divorce and custody proceedings with chartered accountant husband Indranil Das, who had kidnapped the two boys three years ago.

 Criminal Investigation Department (CID), on the basis of an earlier order of the high court, had rounded up Indranil from Mumbai last month and produced the children ? aged 13 and 11 ? before a division bench of the high court.

 Indranil sought two months? custody of his sons for them to complete their classes. ?Only two months are left for them to finish a session. The court should allow me to take them to Dehra Dun for two months only,? he prayed.

 But Sukanya?s lawyers ? Biswajit Basu and Sushenjit Banik ? opposed the prayer and told the court that Indranil would leave the country with the two children if his prayer was granted. The lawyers argued that their mother was quite capable of managing the boys? studies.

 The court accepted the argument and awarded Sukanya permanent custody of her children. Later on Thursday, Biswajit Basu said Sukanya had contacted the school authorities in Dehra Dun and confirmed that her two sons would continue to study in the same school, but under changed guardianship.

 According to her counsel, Sukanya and the boys had been staying with her parents in Garia when, in January 2003, Indranil managed to abduct his sons and flee. Sukanya had been granted custody of her sons by an interim order of a city sessions? judge.

 She then moved a habeas corpus petition before the high court and the division bench, presided over by Justice Ashok Kumar Ganguly and Justice Soumitra Pal, asked the CID to track down Indranil and the boys. After his arrest, last month, Indranil was produced before the city sessions? court and granted bail. But the judge asked police to produce the children before the high court.

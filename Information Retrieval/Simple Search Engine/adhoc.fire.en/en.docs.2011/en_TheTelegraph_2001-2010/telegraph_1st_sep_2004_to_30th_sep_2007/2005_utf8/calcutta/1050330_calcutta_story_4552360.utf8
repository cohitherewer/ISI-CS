 Nowadays exams are so result-oriented and parents are so demanding that I have seen friends worrying over what would happen if they score below the expectations of their parents. Even if their children have produced mediocre results all through, parents expect them to turn into one-pointers in the Board exams. They bring food, wake them up, make them sit at the study table, but they never talk to them to find out what is going wrong. Such parents certainly need counselling, to make them accept their childs potential. I wish our school had a trained counsellor. My friends would have benefited.

 If there is pressure at both home and school, then a student definitely needs a counsellor. I get freaked out before exams so I was lucky that my parents were supportive. In the absence of a counsellor in my former school, friends kept messaging and calling up each other to keep up our morale. Abroad it is common to see a counsellor. But here a visit is seen as a symptom of madness. Classmates would talk if someone visits a counsellor. It is easier if parents come along on the visit, that too outside school. A session could ease the pre-exam stress.

I had fared very badly in my pre-tests and was very 

depressed. That was the first time I went to the school counsellor. Since then 

I have been there 10 times ? mostly with friends who wanted to go. The sessions 

centred around tips to manage time and increase concentration and the assurance 

that results do not matter in the long run. What counsellors say hardly matters 

as it is up to the student whether it sinks in. I was back to my depressed self 

a couple of day after the pep talk. But it is good to have a counsellor.

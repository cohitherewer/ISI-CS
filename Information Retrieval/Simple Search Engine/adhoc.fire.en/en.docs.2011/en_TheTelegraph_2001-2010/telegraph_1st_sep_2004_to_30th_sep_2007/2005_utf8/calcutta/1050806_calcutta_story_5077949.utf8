 Working class hero shines on Broadway

 Over two decades after his death, the magic of John Lennon is being revived through a musical with a multi-racial, male-female cast. Allan Kozinn catches up with Lennon

 For Don Scardino, the idea of writing and directing a musical about John Lennon was impossible to resist, even though the pitfalls of undertaking the project could not have been clearer. He knew enough about the world of obsessive fandom to understand that however he presented Lennon, there would be choruses of objection. 

 Still, when Edgar Lansbury mentioned the prospect in 1998, Scardino signed on immediately. Lansbury, who has produced about 20 Broadway and off-Broadway plays, had the idea of producing a Lennon musical, and he had scheduled a meeting to propose the idea to Yoko Ono, Lennon?s widow, who controls the rights to the singer?s name and music. 

 From the start, Scardino said, he considered it crucial to focus on Lennon?s solo work. The principal selling point of Scardino?s proposal, though, was his reconfiguration of Lennon. Instead of having a single actor play him, Scardino proposed having the full cast ? nine actors, male and female and of various ethnicities ? slipping in and out of the Lennon role, each speaking his words and singing his music. He also decided that the dialogue, or at least the lines spoken by Lennon, should be drawn from the lengthy retrospective interviews Lennon gave throughout his life. 

 ?So many people have approached me and said, ?Can I do a musical of John,?? Ono said. ?It?s a very simple idea, you know ? wow, a musical of John! But I?ve said no. This time, I said yes, because I liked the idea of having these different actors playing John. Because in the years after John?s passing, John has transformed into something else. People in Asia think of him as their hero. People in Africa think of him as their hero. He was a hero for the whole world, and not just a white hero. So it?s great to have a black performer singing as John. For me, this play is a revolution, a quiet revolution.?

 John would have loved this so much. He always used to say, ?I wish I had a black voice ? they?re such great blues singers, we can never imitate them.? So now, a black John? He?d be jumping up and down.?

 For the record, the cast includes three white and two black men, and a black, an Asian, a Hispanic and a white woman. Ono, who attended auditions, said that efforts to find a male Asian cast member for her dream Rainbow Coalition of John proved fruitless. And a black Lennon isn?t the only identity bending here. And when the Beatles are seen performing, they are portrayed by the four women.

 Another attraction of Scardino?s script, Ono said, was the irreverent humour with which it touches on aspects of Lennon?s life, including his early-1970?s association with Jerry Rubin and other political radicals, and the FBI?s consequent decision to put him under surveillance. ?They could have done it all very seriously,? Ono said, ?but John was a funny guy. Even just the role changes are funny, but it?s the laughter of awakening ? realising, when we see a black actor representing the Ku Klux Klan, that we are all one, there is good and bad in every race. It?s that kind of awakening that makes people laugh.?

Ono added that in the late 1970?s, she and Lennon were writing an autobiographical musical, to be called The Ballad of John and Yoko. They never finished a script, but Lennon wrote several songs for it, most of which exist only on rough private recordings that have not been released. Ono gave Scardino two of them, India, India (which now accompanies a scene about the Beatles? flirtation with Transcendental Meditation) and I Don?t Want to Lose You, affixed to the section about Lennon?s 18-month separation from Ono starting in 1973. 

 Otherwise, Ono said, she has been fairly hands-off. ?I did make some suggestions,? she said. ?I was particularly concerned about how they portrayed Cynthia,? Ono said of Lennon?s first wife. ?I told them they couldn?t just use what John said, because he might have said things that were not that accurate, and it?s not fair to her. I wanted them to take the trouble of researching that, and they did.?

 When an early version of the musical ran in San Francisco, in the spring, it drew the critical fire that Scardino had expected. Cynthia Lennon, treated cursorily, was given a greater presence. It was also said that Ono was given too much of the spotlight and Scardino toned down her role. ?In San Francisco, people were saying, ?Oh, Yoko is all over the place,? ? Ono said, ?and I said, well, I was all over the place, in his life, because he wanted me to be.?

 There were also complaints about the absence of Beatles songs in the score, even songs that Lennon wrote on his own. It is not as though the Beatles are ignored. The first 50 minutes of the two-hour show take place before the Beatles? break-up. Their girl-group version is shown performing in their formative days in Hamburg and at the Royal Command Performance in 1963.

 The opening chord of A Hard Day?s Night drifts by at one point, and a stormy scene from the recording sessions for the Let It Be album ? during which Lennon expresses his contempt for Paul McCartney?s Maxwell?s Silver Hammer ? represents the band?s break-up. 

 As it turns out, Lennon?s solo songs are easily adapted to the story line, even that of the Beatles years. Instant Karma, for example, proves a perfect comment on the fracas caused by Lennon?s 1966 remark that the Beatles were bigger than Jesus; nothing in the Beatles? songbook captures quite the same feeling. Lennon?s mother?s death, a central trauma in his early life, is illustrated with Mother, a song he wrote after undergoing primal scream therapy. 

 And the Beatles? breakup gets a double dose ? How Do You Sleep, the 1971 slam of McCartney, and God, the 1970 song in which Lennon disavows everything from the Bible to the Beatles, and concludes ?I just believe in me ? Yoko and me, that?s reality.? 

 Other songs fit the story straightforwardly: Give Peace a Chance and Power to the People are the natural soundtracks for the section on Lennon?s political involvements, and songs from his 1980 Double Fantasy album do what they were written to do ? describe the dynamic between him and Ono in his last years.

 Scardino?s Lennon opens officially on August 14 at Broadhurst theatre.

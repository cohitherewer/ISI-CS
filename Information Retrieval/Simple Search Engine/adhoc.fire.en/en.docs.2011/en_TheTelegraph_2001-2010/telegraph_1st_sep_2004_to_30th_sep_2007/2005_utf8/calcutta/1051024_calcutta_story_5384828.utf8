 Shuffle to stem exodus

 - Teacher count revamp to focus on emerging areas of study

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 The state government has given Calcutta University a free hand to rationalise its lopsided and dated teacher-deployment policy to stem the exodus of postgraduate students.

 The worst-affected subjects include bio-technology, micro-biology, molecular biology, environmental science and bio-chemistry ? all identified as ?emerging areas? and popular among students because of the job opportunities they offer.

 The university, an official explained, has a fixed number of teachers ? many of whom are in departments that hardly draw any students ? which the government has refused to increase because of a funds crunch.

 The state council of higher education, which met early this month to discuss the issue, noted that teachers outnumber students in several postgraduate departments. 

 For instance, the Pali department, where two students on an average enrol every year, has five full-time teachers and a number of part-timers.

 Similarly, not more than a couple of students take admission to the MA course in Sanskrit. But the department has six full-time teachers. 

 Again, the Tamil department, where not a single student has enrolled in the past many years, has two full-timers. Six full-timers are employed to teach Persian and Arabic to a handful.

 In contrast, none of the ?emerging areas? have more than three full-time teachers. 

 According to Dhrubajyoti Chattopadhyay, dean of the university?s science faculty, the ideal figure should be many times more. 

 ?Why should the government spend such huge amounts for running departments for which there is no demand?? a senior official of the state finance department asked the council members at the meeting.

 ?The demand for subjects like bio-technology is increasing not just in the country, but also in the West. We must have enough good teachers if we want brilliant students to study emerging courses in our institution,? said Shyamapada Pal, a member of the university syndicate and the West Bengal Higher Education Council.

 The academics are welcoming the government?s move to bestow ?absolute powers? on the university to cut down on the number of teachers in departments that have little demand and simultaneously increase the number in those that are much in demand. 

 ?We are interacting with the departments and trying to figure out how best to adjust and share the existing posts,? said Chattopadhyay.

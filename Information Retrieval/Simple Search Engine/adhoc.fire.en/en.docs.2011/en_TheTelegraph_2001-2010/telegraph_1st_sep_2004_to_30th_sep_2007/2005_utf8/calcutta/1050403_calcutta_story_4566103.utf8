 Lifestyle dons a new avatar. The weekly event at Sourav?s: The Food Pavilion, Lifestyle Kolkata, has entered its second leg by bringing to the fore the talents of jewellery designers. After providing a platform for more than two dozen budding fashion designers over the last month-and-a-half, funky accessories are now in focus at the Park Street address.

 The ladies who showcased their creativity this Friday night were Eina Ahluwalia, Vasundhara Mantri and Shreelekha Pradhan. Models June, Ishika, Sulagna, Barnali and Anushmitra strutted the classy fourth-floor lounge flaunting an entire range inspired by national and international styles ? from simple and elegant silver pieces created by Shreelekha to Moroccan-style fossil pendants from Eina, and Vasundhara?s contemporary designs.

 Music mania

 Those in BED on Ballygunge Circular 

 Road on Friday evening tuned in to the sounds of truly international 

 music as French DJ Neuromotor dished out high-on-beats electronic 

 music ? something new to Calcutta.

 After playing in Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Pune, the Frenchman made the city?s party people rock till the early hours of Saturday with high-energy beats of some pulsating music.

 Bold paintings in neon colours on black cloth hand-painted by Rajasthani artisans helped to ring in the mood of the evening that was soon sent soaring by bartender Irfaan?s cocktails.

 Flat fizz

 It was an April Fool trick that 

 was not meant to be. Liquor major Bacardi drew the party 

 people of the city to what was touted to be the official 

 high-profile launch of Rigo ? the newest RTD (ready-to-drink) 

 offering from the Bacardi stable. 

 A full house of Tantra regulars waited in anticipation of a rerun to the hugely-popular launch party of Breezer, hosted at the same venue a year ago. What they had to make do with, instead, was a show that was poorer than the first party?s poorest cousin.

 Having been lured with promises of witnessing Salsa dance performances by international dancers skilled in the art, the crowd was forced to watch a group of dancers from a local troupe.

 Funnily enough, the show was strikingly similar to half-a-dozen other low-profile promotions of the drink that had been taking place across nightclubs of Calcutta for over a month now.

 ?These dancers were there in Starstruck Retro Lounge a month back for the promotion of Rigo. Why were we invited to watch the same thing again?? a peeved party hopper complained.

 The final swallow ? with nothing new about the launch or the drink, it was more rig than Rigo.

 All attitude

 Keeping your attitude at all times 

 is the key to some party action. Tantra and Channel [V] 

 have joined hands to kickstart a series of fun-filled weekends. 

 Attitude Weekend Jam Sessions, as they?ve been labelled, 

 lay the stress on music by churning out chart-toppers in 

 the commercial, R amp;B, Hip-Hop and dance arenas.

 Just as Saturday?s launch was attended by VJ Sarah-Jane, the first weekend of every month will have a different VJ. What?s more, the choice of VJ can be decided entirely by the party hopper and depending on popular consensus, he or she will be brought down to rock the weekend.

 In-house DJs Vishal, Sammy and Oblix will complement every jam session with their trademark dance, R amp;B and an eclectic mix of popular tracks. 

 So, if early partying is your style, and jam sessions your haunt, strap on your attitude and stroll into Tantra these weekends.

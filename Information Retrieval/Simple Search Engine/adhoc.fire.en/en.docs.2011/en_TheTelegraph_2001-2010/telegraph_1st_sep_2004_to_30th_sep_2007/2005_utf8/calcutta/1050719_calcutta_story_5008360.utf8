 It?s got the look

 If you thought Tollywood?s masala movies could never ever be a patch on the pomp and show of Bollywood, it?s time for a reality check. Currently on the floors with its second schedule, Probhat Roy?s Shubhadrishti is riding high on the trademark glitz of Sooraj Barjatya and his Rajashri Films, which is co-producing the film with Shree Venkatesh. With a screenplay cramming in two weddings, lots of drama and plenty of emotion, director Roy is upbeat about bringing out the best from his star team of Jeet and Koel Mullick.

 The storyline has much in common with the Madhuri Dixit-Salman Khan-starrer Hum Aapke Hain Kaun?! ? a Rajashri blockbuster ? in the first half. But Roy has spiced up the drama with several twists and turns in the second half to suit the Bengali palate.

 ?The Rajashri people had watched some of my films like Lathi and wanted me to direct this film. They have given me enough freedom to direct the film as I wish. Since it?s a film revolving around a family and bonding, we are trying to infuse an old-world charm. But it is very fast paced,? says Roy, now busy with the second schedule after a bit of a break. The major part of the first schedule involved sequences of two weddings shot on the sets (meant to be Koel?s home) created by art director Indranil Ghosh at Technicians?. ?The sets had a lot of detailing and the costumes were also very gorgeous,? adds Roy.

 While Ghosh gave Koel?s home a lavish look, her costumes were jazzed up with a designer touch. She sports a girl-next door image and so hangs around in colourful and chic churidar kurta.

 ?Probhatda wanted her look to be glamorous but realistic. She?s a traditional Indian girl,? says Sudeshna Roy, who has been helped by NIFT student Tuli Ghosh in creating Koel?s wardrobe. A pink brocade sari, a gold and yellow tissue sari are the highlights of the collection. For her own (screen) wedding though, which was canned in the first schedule itself, Koel got to wear a red zardosi Benarasi.

 In sync with all the glitter and glamour, Anjali Jewellers has decked Koel up with casual and wedding ornaments. ?Since it?s a family story and has several weddings, we opted for a lot of gold polish with stones. Some pieces are chunky to go with the zardosi sari. We have given Koel a pink tourmaline neckpiece with layered jhumka, the kind you had in Veera-Zaara,? says Ananya Chowdhury of Anjali, working on her second Bengali feature film after Chokher Bali.

 There?s also antique silver jewellery on black thread and a stone-studded heart-shaped pendant for the heroine.

 Leading man Jeet will be seen flooring girls in an exquisite silk kurta designed by Sharbari Dutta. ?The kurta has intricate hand embroidery and Jeet is very fond of my clothes,? says Dutta. For casual wear, Jeet?s wardrobe is filled with Indo-Western outfits, including party shirts and pants.

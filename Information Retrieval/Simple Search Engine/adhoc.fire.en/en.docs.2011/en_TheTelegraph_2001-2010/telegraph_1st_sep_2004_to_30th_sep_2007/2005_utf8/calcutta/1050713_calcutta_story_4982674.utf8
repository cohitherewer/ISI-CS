 Signal snag delays trains

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Train services at Howrah station were disrupted for an hour on Tuesday evening due to a snag in the route relay interlocking system. Schedules of Eastern and South Eastern Railway were affected.

 ?Train services were disrupted due to a technical fault in electronic relay circuit of route relay interlocking cabin,? a spokesperson of Eastern Railway said. ?Engineers rushed to the spot and detected the fault. It has been repaired,? he added. 

 The fault affected the signalling system in Howrah, which in turn, disrupted train movements. The problems started at 6.45 pm. The trains were stalled till 7.50 pm.

 Several long-distance trains were stuck as a result of the snag. Services limped back to normalcy late in the evening.

 Minutes before the fault, 2323 Up Howrah-New Delhi Superfast Express and T-95 Up Howrah-Tarakeswar local had left the station. Both were stranded at the Howrah yard after the signalling system went bust. 

 The trains remained stuck for more than an hour at the yard. They resumed their journey around 8 pm.

 Several other long-distance trains, including 3005 Up Howrah-Amritsar Mail, 2311 Howrah-Delhi Kalka Mail, 3023 Up Howrah-Gaya Express and Howrah-Varanasi Bibhuti Express were stranded at the station. They departed behind schedule.

 ?The rakes of these trains could not be brought to the platform from the yard before the snag and so their departure was delayed,? an official explained. 

 The first Eastern Railway train to leave Howrah station after the fault was repaired was a Howrah-Bandel local. According to officials, three pairs of local trains had to be cancelled due to the technical problem. Ten pairs of long-distance trains leave the station between 6.45 and 7.50 in the evening.

 ?Except those trains, the rest departed on time,? an official said. 

 Long-distance trains run by Southeastern Railway were also stranded at the station. A pair of local train had to be cancelled, while others ran 30 minutes late on an average. 

 Besides, 2810 Howrah-Mumbai Mail, via Nagpur, left 25 minutes behind schedule, while 8003 Howrah-Yeshvantpur Express was late by 40 minutes. Howrah-Chennai Mail was stuck and the departure of Howrah-Sambalpur Express was deferred.

 The snag caused harassment to thousands of daily commuters on their way home. ?We have been stranded at the station for more than an hour,? complained L.N. Chakraborty, a state government employee.

 The Rs 3.5-crore route relay interlocking system was commissioned in September 2003. The station had to remain shut for a day for the commissioning. Within 30 hours, the system developed a point failure, disrupting train schedules. However, the earlier speed limit of 15 kph for first two kilometres was raised to 30 kph, officials said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Sit-ups for tease on Metro

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A youth was made to do sit-ups holding his ears after he clutched a girl?s hand at the Esplanade Metro station on Monday afternoon. 

 Metro officials meted out the punishment in the station manager?s office. Police action was not initiated, as the girl refused to lodge a complaint.

 Around 2 pm, the girl was taking an escalator to the platform, when the youth tugged her hand. Her co-passengers reacted fast to her cries and caught the youth. 

 They took him to the station manager?s room. The girl accompanied them.

 ?In front of the station manager, the girl identified the youth and admitted that he had pulled her by her hand,? said a Metro official. 

 The staff initially informed the Hare Street police station, but soon called up the cops to ask them not to come, when the girl refused to lodge any written complaint. 

 ?The matter was amicably settled. The girl said that she had forgiven the youth, and so we did not seek their identities,? the official added.

 The youth, however, was not allowed to go scot-free. He had to do a round of sit-ups holding his ears and seek the girl?s apology before being allowed to leave.

 Metro Rail police officers later visited the station manager?s room to investigate the incident. They filed a general diary.

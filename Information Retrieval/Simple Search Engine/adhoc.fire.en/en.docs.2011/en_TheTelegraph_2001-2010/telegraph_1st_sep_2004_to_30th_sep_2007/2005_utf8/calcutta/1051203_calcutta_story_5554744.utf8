 You share your birthday with...

 Julianne Moore 

You are a deep reservoir of emotions. For you, love means everything. You are devoted, open-minded and never give up when the going gets tough. You like to work in a planned and organised manner. You diligently adhere to duty even if a job doesn?t appeal to you. Regardless of your occupation, your efficient and conscious nature makes you a good superviser and analyst. ? Kusum Bhandari

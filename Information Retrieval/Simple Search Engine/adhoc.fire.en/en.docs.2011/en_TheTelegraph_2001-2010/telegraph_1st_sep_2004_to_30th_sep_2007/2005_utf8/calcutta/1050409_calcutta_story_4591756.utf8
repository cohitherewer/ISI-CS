 How many uses can you put crystal to? Ornaments, chandeliers, decorative items ? But certainly not stamps, the kind that takes letters from one place to the other. A visit to the stamp fair happening over the weekend at Charnock City in Salt Lake will convince you to the contrary.

 Six droplets of crystal ? Swarovski, no less ? adorn the surface of a couple of Austrian stamps, priced at 3.75 Euros.

 ?Mind you, the current standard postal tariff in Austria is about 0.55 Euros. So the stamps are basically meant to generate philatelic interests,? smiles Kalyan Negal, general secretary, Indian Philatelic Traders? Association. 

 If a stamp with crystals catches your fancy, also ask for a bit of embroidered cloth, issued courtesy Swiss Post.

 Switzerland, which has a long tradition in the art, brought out the world?s first embroidered stamp in 2000, using a machine that did 200 revolutions a minute producing 340 stamps in one embroidery pass. 

 Stamps can also do magic. Negal produces an envelope bearing one brought out by Royal Mail. ? Stare at the dot for 30 seconds then at a white wall?, suggests the 68p UK stamp. The dot is supposed to vanish. Others in the series, commemorating 100 years of Magic Circle, have other tricks up their perforated sleeves.

 ?Countries like Bhutan and Tonga have been producing stamps using non-conventional material (gold and silver foil, plastic etc) since the 60s and 70s. But philatelists did not take them seriously then. Now that sale of stamps is on the wane, there is a conscious effort worldwide to revive interest. Using such material is part of the plan,? Negal explains.

 The exhibition, attracting dealers from all over the country, is also rich in conventional rarities. K.M. Singh of Allahabad shows an envelope bearing an impression of Mahatma Gandhi under which a George V one-Anna stamp has been affixed. ?This was posted in 1922 from Malaysia, where a sizeable Indian population lived. The gesture amounted to outright treason. Only two such stamps exist,? he said, though refusing to divulge the price he was quoting for it.

 A. Shafiq Khan of Kanpur comes to the fair every year. ?Calcutta is a good market,? he nods, organising the 5,000 stamps he has brought over. Other articles vital to the hobby are also on sale.

 The show ends with an auction on Sunday evening, sure to have bidders locking horns over prize buys.

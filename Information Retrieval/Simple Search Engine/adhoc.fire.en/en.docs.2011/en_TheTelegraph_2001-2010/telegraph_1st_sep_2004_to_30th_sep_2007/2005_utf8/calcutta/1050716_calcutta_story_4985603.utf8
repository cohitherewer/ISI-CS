 The remix rage will not last

 Debuting on television, the Pal singer KK talks to Pratim D. Gupta about guiding fresh talent and the ballad bias of his new album

 MUSIC ZONE 

 You are seen more these days than heard. Why did you agree to be part of the Fame Gurukul jury?

 I had never done television before. There have been offers for more than three years now from a lot of TV shows. But I didnt want to do another anchoring job. It makes sense to do a show on the small screen only when its substantial. 

 When Sony Entertainment Television told me about the show, I was really excited. Fourteen aspirants living and being taught in a secluded area; I thought it would be really like a school. The concept of a gurukul sounded very traditional, representative of our culture. Of course, it had to be modernised, otherwise no one would have watched it. 

 so, the fact that the other jury members were Javedsaab and a friend like Shankar Mahadevan gave me the impetus.

 Now that you have shot a couple of episodes, has it turned out the way you had imagined?

 Yes, we have shot three episodes and its turning out to be very good. I was in a mall some time back and people were coming up to me to say how they liked the show. 

 I think its the reality quotient which is at work here. Of course, a little bit of it is dramatised, but very real. When I got to chat with the participants I could realise how serious they were. Obviously not all are equally talented ? some are very good while others are not so. 

 In a way, I am getting a chance to do my bit and help realise some dream. There have always been so many eager aspirants asking for guidance. Through Fame Gurukul, I can at least tell some of them what to do and what not to do.

 Your song Pal had become phenomenally popular when the Indian Idol finalists sang it together hellip;

 The song is so phenomenal and the lines so evergreen that even after 10 years it wouldnt sound dated. It was one of those songs which I got to sing, thankfully. I know the Indian Idol thing did make Pal an anthem of sorts. Now they are doing another song of mine, Yaaron. 

 People had come up and asked me whether I had a problem with them singing my songs. I said that after I have sung a song and it is out in the market, anybody can sing it. I would only want them to sing it in tune!

 Pal was, kind of, born again. It had been playing for five years on the radio channels in Mumbai, but it got a whole new life for sure.

 Why don rsquo;t we get to hear more Bollywood numbers from you?

 I have never been a very prolific Bollywood singer. Too much Bollywood is not good ? then you dont have much to say about the songs. Like my songs in No Entry are quite nondescript. But the Dus title track has been a big hit. And there are more good songs coming up from Vishal and Shekhar and Sandesh (Shandilya).

 Your second independent album has been long overdue hellip;

 I swear? its been six years since my debut album. But I have my reasons for it. It has to be good. Even my music company, which has been after me for three years, has realised that its no use pushing this guy. 

 The album is turning out well, though. Mehboobs writing the lyrics again. The reason I went easy on Bollywood is so the album could get a hold on me. We are looking at an October release. 

 It wont be very different ? not very out of the box. It would have ballads mostly, along with some peppy numbers. It would showcase my space.

 How do you plan to combat the sagging private album market ruled by the remix invasion?

 I think we are at a stage where every artiste or music company needs to take stock of the situation and not pass the buck. I know I have a lot of responsibility and I am under a lot of pressure. But deep down inside I want to do something good. 

 There is a lot of remix music which we can do without, especially the videos. I know there is still a definite market for original music. I travel a lot and people keep asking me when my next album is coming out. 

 I am sure that the remix rage is not going to last and we will go back to old-school melodies. Also, the videos which are getting worse everyday, will reach a limit.

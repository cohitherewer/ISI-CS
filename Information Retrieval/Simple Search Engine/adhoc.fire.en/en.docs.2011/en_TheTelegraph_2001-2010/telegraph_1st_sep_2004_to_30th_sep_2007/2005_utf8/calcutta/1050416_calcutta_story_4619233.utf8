 A hand to teach and set ?em on course

 NISHA LAHIRI

 An annual programme put up by Turning Point

 Amitendra had trouble sitting still for long. His time at the rehabilitation centre was spent in restlessness. For the past couple of weeks however, Amitendra, suffering from a mental illness, has found peace and an occupation. He is learning to make handicrafts out of jute, thanks to the Learn And Earn project started by Turning Point.

 He isn?t the only one. Rinky Sengupta is steeped in creativity, learning embroidery and dance amongst others. But the jute workshop has also provided her a source of income. ?I really like it,? she smiles.

 Started earlier this year, the project aims at providing economic independence to people suffering from problems like mental illness, the handicapped and even the disabled, says founder-director of the NGO Turning Point Ishita Sanyal. 

 ?The idea is to make them productive members of society, for their own satisfaction and to make people aware that they are also capable of contributing. For those suffering from mental illness, being able to learn and earn is a reason to get up every morning. We hope to extend and expand the project in due course,? adds Sanyal.

 The project kicked off with a pottery course. Most of the products made by the attendees of Turning Point?s Jadavpur rehabilitation centre were sold at exhibitions and through a store called Akriti in Salt Lake?s City Centre. 

 The month-long jute workshop is being conducted in association with the National Centre for Jute Diversification, with support from deputy jute commissioner and executive director Saurabh Kumar Das. The training and raw material are being provided by the centre. Although the classes began on March 28, the official launch with some fanfare was held on April 14.

 From 10 am to 4 pm everyday, they work in unison at Turning Point. Anirban proudly displays his door hanging, completed after a few hours worth of effort. It?s the first time he?s done something like this. ?It looked easy at first, but was a little difficult when I got down to doing it. But I?ve managed to finish it,? he says.

 ?Even something like tying the knots helps improve their concentration. So it helps them in many ways. The products will be sold through NCJD?s outlets and Akriti. We already have orders for things like shoes,? sums up Sanyal.

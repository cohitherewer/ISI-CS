 No-parking pitch to fill up terminals

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The state government has decided to declare stretches of Kona Expressway, Mumbai Road (from Kona to Dhulagarh) and Delhi Road (up to Bally) no-parking zones by mid-April.

 The entry of trucks into the city from the districts and neighbouring states, in violation of rules, and parking of the vehicles on the National Highways has forced the administration to consider this measure.

 ?Many truck operators park their vehicles on the highways, instead of parking them in the terminal. But so far, we were unable to take any steps against them as the stretches were not marked as no-parking zones. So, we have decided to declare some areas at the entry points of the city no-parking zones,?? said additional director-general (ADG) of police (traffic) Tapan Chattopadhyay.

 The district magistrate of Howrah will soon issue the necessary notification in this regard, he said. ?Once the areas are declared no-parking zones, police will take action against offenders and impound the vehicles,?? Chattopadhyay added.

 Senior state police officers, including the ADG and deputy inspector-general (traffic), on Wednesday held meetings with the Howrah district police at Dhulagarh to prepare an action plan to curb the parking menace on highways.

 The move comes in the wake of complaints from the Dhulagarh terminal authorities that the truck operators from the districts and other states avoid the terminal and park their vehicles on the roads.

 Nearly 55,000 vehicles enter the city from different districts and states every day. According to the rulebook, trucks are not allowed to enter the city between 9 am and 9 pm. But, a large number of trucks allegedly bribe police and violate the rule.

 ?We are chalking out a plan of action. It?s just a few days? wait. From April 14, trucks won?t be seen parked on the roads, instead, they will be inside the terminals,?? ADG Chattopadhyay said.

 Three truck terminals have already been built in Dhulagarh ? a joint venture with Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation (TIDC), Kona ? built by Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority ? and Budge Budge ? built by TIDC. 

 The government aims at imposing a total ban on entry of goods vehicles into the city.

 ?I have sought chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s intervention in the matter as I found that trucks are not parked at the terminal despite the facilities. I tried to convince him that the concept of building truck terminals will not be fruitful until and unless the government can ensure that the trucks enter the terminals,? said Ramratan Chowdhury, managing director of Dhulagarh Truck Terminal Limited.

 ?What is the utility of a terminal if the trucks are parked on roads at night and then enter the city during the day???

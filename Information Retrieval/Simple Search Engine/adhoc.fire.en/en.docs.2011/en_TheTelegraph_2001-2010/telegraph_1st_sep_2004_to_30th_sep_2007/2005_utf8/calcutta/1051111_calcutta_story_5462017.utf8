 Siblings in suicide rerun

 - Teenager returns from play to hang herself like brother

 A STAFF REPORTER

Tragedy knocked on the Banerjee door for the second 

time in five months on Thursday. In the evening, the 15-year-old daughter of the 

house, Sangita, ended her life in exactly the same manner as her brother in May 

this year (picture left).

 After playing with cousins the entire afternoon in their apartment, the girl returned to her family?s ground-floor flat in the same building, in Purbachal, Kasba, around 6 pm, only to commit suicide. The parents were away and the flat was empty, except for the two pet dogs.

 When Rama Banerjee returned in the evening, she found daughter Sangita?s study room bolted from inside. When repeated calls failed to elicit a response and the dogs kept barking frantically, she called the neighbours. The caretaker of the building was also summoned.

 The door was brought down and the teenager was found hanging from the ceiling fan.

 ?She left no note. Even a few hours earlier, she was happy and playing. She had no financial problems to worry about. This is a complete shock for us,? said Rama.

 Sangita?s teenaged brother Sandeep had committed suicide in the same room by hanging from the same fan under equally inexplicable circumstances. 

 Cousin Supriyo Das Sanyal said: ?Sangita used to mix freely with people. We went partying together during the Puja. No one had a clue that she was suffering from depression. Maybe she missed her brother??

 Sangita studied in Class X of Garfa Dhirendranath High School, while her brother was in Class XI of Haltu High School.

 ?Sangita was gregarious, but Sandeep was an introvert. The siblings were very close and both did well in their studies. Since the family didn?t have any financial problems, it might be that academic pressures drove both of them to this end,? added Supriyo.

 Father Shyamal is a trader in Kasba. The children had lost their grandfather last December.

 VAT block in water pipes

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Confusion over value-added tax (VAT) has led to a severe shortage of pipes at the civic water supply department. 

 Depletion of the stock of poly-pipes at the central store of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) is denying residents of the southern and eastern fringes of the city the benefits of the booster pumping stations in Kasba, Ranikuthi, Bansdroni, Garfa, Kalighat and Bagmari.

 The pipes are required to supply filtered water to households from the booster stations. 

 Around two months ago, the CMC had placed a Rs 1.5-crore order with an Orissa-based company for supply of poly-pipes. The delivery was delayed by the strike over VAT. 

 The company had said the pipes would be delivered on April 1, but the consignment is yet to reach the civic store. 

 The CMC water supply department needs 24 km of pipes of various diameters. A fund of Rs 1.5 crore had been allocated for the purpose.

 Mayor Subrata Mukherjee said the order for the pipes had been placed months ago and it was the responsibility of the mayoral council member in charge of water supply to pursue it. The member, Sovan Chatterjee, said the mayor should allow spot purchase of the pipes.

 The pipes will be used to lay a water distribution network in Behala, Garden Reach, Jadavpur, Kasba, Tiljala and Bosepukur. Besides, the damaged pipes in Ultadanga, Topsia, Bowbazar, Bagbazar, Nimtala, Sovabazar and Kalighat need to be replaced.

 ?We have issued work orders to the contractors and informed the central store two months ago,? said Chatterjee.

 The distribution network cannot be laid before the civic polls if the pipes are not procured in a week, water supply engineers said.

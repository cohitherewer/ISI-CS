The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Of pain amp; the present 

The poems have been pouring in as usual from Young 

Metro readers and writers. Here?s a special selection, addressing a variety 

of issues 

 The Absurd Festival was inaugurated with 

an exhibition and theatre performance at Oxford Bookstore on Wednesday. Picture

Droppings

I get born a hundred births 

I die a hundred deaths. 

Yet when I look at the pool of blood 

I see, 

Your soul caressing your corpse... 

The fangs of technology penetrate deep inside me 

And froths of pain ooze out, 

I lap it all up 

As I have all I have to have ? 

Gormandising delicately 

And I drink my spirit 

The one imprisoned in a green bottle

With dead letters 

Then I lick my lips and say 

I?m lovin? it... 

My eyes catch a stray wink 

Was it dream dust? 

Nights... 

Stormy nights... 

Blessings from the sky.

 Help

Silenced by pride

Asking for help

Selling a piece of me

Tainted and taunted

Thrown in my face

Asking for help

Weak and pathetic

Pushing my buttons

Exploiting fears

Lowest common denominator

What do I deserve?

Feeling less than worthy

Asking for help

Most human of qualities

Needing help

Pure and simple

Born needing help

Crying out for help

Feed me

Hold me

Love me

Help me

I would rather starve

Cut off my nose

To spite myself

And everyone who dares to look at me

Alone and suffering

Rather than ask for help

I will die alone

With what is left of my pride

Or feel so low

To consider asking for help

I will die of shame

Perfect double-edged sword

Placed in my grip

By doubt

Which side will cut me deeper?

I?ll have to answer that

Myself

Rather than

Ask for help.

 Trina Dasgupta

 Present Perfect 

I have not! I have not! 

We always pine; 

(and) If I lose my precious 

Is the fear undying. 

But, what do we do, 

With the present we find? 

Do we really live it, or leave it ?

For the future, undefined. 

(The poem is inspired by a letter by Rittika Bhattacharya published in Young 

Metro).

 Poetry 

The whisper of the winter breeze while the sun dims,

And the wide-eyed ocean water past the sand swims? 

Lovers walk me by, I stop, smile, and move on, 

I try capturing the moment before it?s gone? 

I see many rushing past but none stop by, 

As I scribble yet another verse before I die, 

For those who in aloneness shall remember these days, 

Obviously, long after I?m gone, the poet says?

 Theirs is Sorrow 

(for lack of an appropriate name)

Theirs is Sorrow ?

Pure,

True ?

The kind you wrap in a chillum

And smoke up,

Giving a miserable high

Which decays and corrodes,

Kills from inside;

Not just metaphorically.

Belittled by their pain

(while using it for my paltry ends).

The rest is plain amusing.

What?s on your mind this week

Teacher 

torture

After Varnika Gupta, it?s Tiyasa Biswas. She committed 

suicide, refusing to get enmeshed in the web of tuitions. It is a bitter truth 

that teachers today often vent their fury and frustrations on students. Even parents 

force their wards to take up tuitions. But they don?t ask themselves whether the 

students are capable of handling the dual pressures of school curriculum and coaching 

classes. Tiyasa had to bear the psychological torture by her teacher for two years. 

When I was in school, a teacher mentally harassed one boy (my classmate) for refusing 

to participate in the annual school function. He backed out as the exams were 

immediately after. Participating meant going for rehearsals and missing classes 

for three weeks. This ordeal continued for a year. The boy became an introvert 

and started faring badly in school. He was a good student once. Tiyasa?s case 

is more unfortunate because despite being an intelligent student she chose suicide. 

The charges against the teacher of Tiyasa?s school must be investigated and if 

found guilty, she must be punished.

 Clueless?: Sourav Ganguly in the eye of controversy

Cross-border bonds

?An eye for an eye makes the whole world go blind?? 

Mahatma Gandhi. This quote is applicable to the volatile relationship between 

India and Pakistan. But at last friendship and common sense seem to have prevailed. 

The recent Test matches and the ODIs between the two countries is testimony to 

it. The camaraderie between people on either side of the border is heartening 

and I pray that this cross-border bonding proves long lasting.

 Critic culture

Lady Luck is certainly frowning on Sourav Ganguly. 

Nothing seems to be going right for him. First, he faced brickbats for his pitiable 

performance with the willow, and now the match referee has fined him for a slow 

over-rate during the third ODI. His captaincy is in jeopardy. The Indian skipper 

failed to impress again. But so did some of the other Indian batsmen. The media 

has its hands full with Dada, so the others are given a miss. No one can refute 

the fact that the aggression in the Indian team nowadays is the handiwork of Ganguly. 

Has there ever been such a spirit of bonhomie amongst the players? All this and 

more can be credited to the captain. The funny thing is that once Sourav comes 

out of his slump, the very same media will go gaga over him. Before victimising 

a sportsperson at the drop of a hat, one should remember that every player has 

a lean phase. Ganguly?s fans are sure that once he regains his poise he won?t 

take time to swing his bat and reveal his true colours.

 Captain courageous

To many, he is Captain clueless now. Questions are 

being raised on his abilities both as captain and batsman. Is this the premature 

end of Sourav Ganguly?s cricket career? For the last few months nothing has been 

going right with Captain courageous. He is being baselessly accused by the voracious 

vultures of Indian cricket, led by some former players like Bishan Singh Bedi. 

We feel pity for the likes of Charu Sharma (has he ever played cricket?), Krish 

Srikkanth and Atul Wassan (they need to examine their own career records). Making 

any comment against Mandira Bedi or Roshni Chopra raises the eyebrows of feminists. 

Why not invite knowledgeable women like Purnima Rao or Jhulan Goswami to give 

their expert comments? These members of the Indian women?s cricket team know what 

it takes to perform. The comments of these so-called critics are blasphemy against 

cricket. It is more painful when former players like Mohinder Amarnath or Bishan 

Singh Bedi makes such comments. Do we hear Kapil Dev or Sunil Gavaskar saying 

such things? It?s time for the critics, not Sourav, to leave. Sourav is to be 

saluted.

 Minority matters

Can the Supreme Court?s notices to the Centre and 

the Delhi government on a petition questioning the validity of Section 377 of 

the IPC that punishes homosexuality mark a U-turn for the gay movement in India? 

A homosexual has to go through so much ? first coming to terms with his sexuality, 

then coming out to his parents, friends, relatives, colleagues and so on. This 

isn?t easy. Sometimes he loses his near and dear ones just to stay true to his 

own sexual orientation. Homosexuality is touted as a criminal offense in our country 

and as a result of this archaic law established by the British way back in 1868, 

many men have to cope with a lifetime of repression and even sham marriages. While 

homosexuality is not a crime in most countries and some have even legalised same-sex 

marriages, holding back on the issue is adding to the plight of this stigmatised 

community. Can the lawmakers be rational and sensible enough to give them equal 

rights? How can we call ourselves a democracy when the majority sits in judgement 

on the rights of sexual minorities?

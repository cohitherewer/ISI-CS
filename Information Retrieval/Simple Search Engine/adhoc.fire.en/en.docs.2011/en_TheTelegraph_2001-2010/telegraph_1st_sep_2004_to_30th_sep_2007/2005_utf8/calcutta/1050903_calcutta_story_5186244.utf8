 Tradition fused with modernity is the fashion focus at Srejoni, the north Calcutta boutique whose Puja collection was unveiled by film-maker Rituparno Ghosh on Friday. 

 The store has stocked up a variety of saris in tussar, cotton, crepe, chiffon and georgette in block prints and kantha work. The novelty this season is the ikkat-bomkai sari adorned with intricate kantha work and crystals, costing around Rs 8,000. 

 I get the saris from weavers in Orissa; the kantha work is done in Santiniketan by tribal girls. Crystals and beads are later encrusted in my factory, says Arpita Chatterjee, the creative force behind Srejoni, at the Shyambazar five-point crossing.

 The launch of the festive collection also marked the boutiques fifth anniversary.

 For georgettes, we have used the spraying and dyeing technique and embellished it with beads and zardosi work. The soft tussar can be worn round the year and it is ideal for women with a heavy build. Tussar doesnt cling so much to the body as chiffon, adds Arpita, who started the boutique five years ago with kidswear.

 Tussars and pure silks are designed with block prints in floral and geometric motifs with the dominant shades being bright red, rust, green and pastels. Block prints are also available in crepe, chiffon and georgette. 

 The price tag starts from Rs 1,980. The mulmul variety in Dhakai jamdani is pegged at around Rs 17,000, making it the most expensive item on display. Srejoni also stores salwar kameez in cotton and tussar.

 Wax work

 Mohua Mondal has been dabbling in handloom textiles for the past six years, with taant, Dhakai and other handwoven fabrics being her forte.

 But for this festive season, the designer who had fought and lost the CMC elections earlier this year, has treaded on brand new turf by launching a collection of wax-batik worked saris in silks, chiffons, georgettes, crepes and cottons. 

 The line was unveiled on Friday at a three-day exhibition at the Genesis Art Gallery on Middleton Street. The exhibition, on till Sunday, was inaugurated by Mohuas father Ajit Panja.

 Keeping the word he had given his daughter, the veteran politician took a break from his legal duties to spend some time at the art gallery, posing for pictures and urging the two models, Bindu and Priyanka, to showcase Mohuas creations.

 The exhibition showcases tie-and-dye on cotton saris teamed with Kutchi blouses, aari-worked Tangail saris, block-printed tussar saris with hand-painted pallus and borders, ornamental kantha work touched up with sequins.

 The collection is very chic and each piece is extremely wearable. The palette is vibrant, in keeping with the mood of the season, says Mohua, who retails from her boutique at Doveland Court in Ballygunge under the label Mohaniya Ensembles.

 The prices range from Rs 2,200 to Rs 2,500 for the crepes, Rs 1,500 for chiffons, Rs 2,200 to Rs 3,200 for tussars and Rs 650 to Rs 1,650 for cottons.

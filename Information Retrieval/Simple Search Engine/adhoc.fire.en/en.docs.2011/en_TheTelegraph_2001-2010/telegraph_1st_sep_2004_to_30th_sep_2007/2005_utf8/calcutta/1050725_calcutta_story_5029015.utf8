 Refund for migrating cars

 - Vehicle tax guidelines drafted for two and four-wheelers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 If you need to move your car to another state after paying the five-year tax on the vehicle, you need not lose out on the money. 

 Owners of migrating vehicles can now apply to the directorate of public vehicles (PVD) for refund for the period of their absence.

 Responding to a plea by vehicle-owners, the state government has prepared guidelines for refund of vehicle tax when the owners migrate to other states. A notification to the effect was issued last week after the finance department cleared the proposal on Wednesday.

 The refund rules will apply to both the lifetime tax (for two-wheelers) and the one-time five-year tax (for four-wheelers).

 In Calcutta, the PVD director can straightaway allow refunds below Rs 20,000, while for a higher amount, he will have to seek the concurrence of the transport department. 

 In the districts, sub-divisional officers and additional district magistrates have been authorised to refund tax below Rs 20,000. For a higher amount, the transport department?s approval will be needed.

 This is the first time since the introduction of the ?one-time tax? and ?lifetime tax? in September 2003 that the government has drafted guidelines for a refund.

 According to PVD officials, 200 vehicle-owners per month seek no-objection certificates for migrating to other states. ?The annual figure for the city is around 2,400. The refund decision has come as a major relief for these vehicle-owners.?

 However, owners of buses, trucks and other commercial vehicles will not be entitled to a refund if they shift their vehicles temporarily.

 ?Transporters frequently move their buses or trucks from Bengal and ply them elsewhere. In such cases, the vehicle is deemed to be in use during its absence. Hence, we have decided not to allow refund for this period,? said a transport department official.

 According to state government officials, the guidelines had been framed in a way that the refund will be hassle-free.

 ?There has been a refund provision in the Act since the beginning, but the process was very tedious in the absence of clear guidelines. Knowing this, vehicle-owners didn?t approach the authorities,? said an official. 

 Earlier, the local authorities could sanction a refund of only up to Rs 5,000.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Star rooms, 1,000-plus too few

 - Hotels in full boom, guests sent away as luxury addresses eye additions

 PRATIM D. GUPTA

 A couple of years ago, the count was 591. Today, it is 1,064. By 2007-08, the industry is eyeing around 2,000 rooms. Star hospitality in Calcutta has grown, but all it takes for a space jam is one major conference or festive fervour.

 Thanks to the 42nd conference of the Indian Academy of Paediatrics, Pedicon 2005 in the happy hospitality season, all five five-star hotels in the city (ITC Sonar Bangla, Hyatt Regency, Taj Bengal, Oberoi Grand and The Park) have a house-full board hanging till January 10. Even the second rung, in the form of Hotel Hindusthan International and The Kenilworth, is sold out till Sunday.

 With over 5,000 delegates camping in town, all star hotels have had to turn down walk-in guests and respond in the negative to endless telephonic queries. ?Since the rooms were booked well in advance, around four months ago, we were able to inform our regular corporate accounts. But we have had to refuse those looking for rooms now,? said an official from Hyatt Regency.

 When ITC Sonar Bangla and Hyatt Regency opened doors in Calcutta a couple of years ago, there was a question mark on whether there was enough business in Calcutta. As a spokesperson for Taj Bengal put it: ?Our existence was questioned when they came up, but our business never suffered. ITC has done well and Hyatt, with an initial hiccup, is doing well too. The business, rather than the tourism, sector has flourished. Even last year, all hotels were sold out due to a medical conference. This has to happen more often for other hotels to start business here.?

 But adding rooms with a view on growing demand is on the ITC Sonar Bangla agenda. ?With 1,000 rooms, the city comes into the reckoning for hosting national-level conferences,? said Ranvir Bhandari, general manager, ITC Sonar Bangla. ?Between October and March, the hotel business in Calcutta has been very big? With the growing boom in IT, FMCG, infrastructure and now foreign direct investment, by 2007, the city should double the number of luxury rooms. We could set up another tower on the six acres in the Sunderbans area to house 150 more rooms,? he added.

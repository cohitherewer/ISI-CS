 Vandalism after death

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Inhabitants of Gobindapur slum, in Lake Gardens, vandalised 

the Jodhpur Park house of Kamala Gupta, 72, on Tuesday. Gupta?s 19-year-old maid, 

Deepa, allegedly set herself on fire on Monday, and died the next day at MR Bangur 

Hospital.

 Soon after news of the death spread, slum-dwellers attacked the Gupta house and alleged that the family had abetted the suicide, though police have not found any merit in the charge.

 Deepa reportedly doused herself with kerosene and set herself ablaze. Her body has been sent for post-mortem. The girl?s parents, in Bangladesh, have been informed and a police picket has been posted outside the Gupta house.

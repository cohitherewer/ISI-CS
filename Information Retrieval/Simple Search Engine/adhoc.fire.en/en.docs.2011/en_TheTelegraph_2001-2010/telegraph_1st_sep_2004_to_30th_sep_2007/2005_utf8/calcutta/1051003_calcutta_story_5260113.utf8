 No forecasting body-dictating dos and donts a year in advance, no preview on the ramp a season ahead and no rub-off effects from global runways. Durga puja does not follow any of the usual rules governing fashion trends, but it remains one of the biggest mass style extravaganzas in this part of the world. It is guided by a rather rare set of dress codes, with the one fairly constant influence being Bollywood.

 Some Puja milestones ? the lacy pink frock and the slim-fitted Chinese-collared kurta with a floral pattern on one side sported by Bhagyasree in Maine Pyar Kiya in 1989; the see-through georgette kurta worn over a bustier and teamed with loose trousers by Madhuri Dixit in Dil To Pagal Hai in 1997; the traditional Bengali sari drape with puff-sleeved lacy blouse flaunted by Aishwarya Rai in Devdas in 2002.

 After a lull of a couple of years, Bollywood is back in fashion with a bang, riding high on the success of the Bunty Aur Babli look ? fitted thigh-length kurtas with collars, paired with loose Patialas, accessorised with a sling jhola bag. Sported by Rani Mukherjee throughout the Shaad Ali romantic comedy, this fashion statement has permeated every layer of the fashion industry this Puja. So, be it middle-level designer or the Vardaan Market store churning out the style in silks and crepes or the Gariahat shop replicating it in cotton and cheaper fabrics, the October look dominates every fashion space.

 GoodLife gets into the Puja fashion groove.

 Cothes

 The biggest trend this time is the Bunty Aur Babli salwar suit, confirms designer Agnimitra Paul. These are collared kurtas stopping mid-thigh with three-quarter sleeves. These are either plain or patchworked in very vibrant colours. The lowers are in the form of Patialas. The collars and the Patialas are the highlights of the look, she explains.

 The other trend in salwar suits is the heavily-embroidered churidar with a relatively plain kameez. The focus is totally on the lowers. The churidars are either embroidered fully or till the knee, says Megha Dalmiya. The young designer has combined this with the Bunty Aur Babli look. I have embroidered the Patialas very heavily and teamed them with plain kurtas, with the collars and cuffs in the same colours as the lowers. These are my hottest-selling items for the Pujas, says Megha.

 The poncho of last year has made a comeback, but in a slightly longer avatar, as kaftans. Mostly in chiffons and georgettes, the knee-length flowing uppers are worn either with full lining or over a bustier for a more see-through feel, gathered at the waist with a broad belt. These are paired either with churidars or cigarette pants. Kaftans are very in right now and they have become more popular than ponchos with Calcutta women because it hides figure flaws, feels Agnimitra.

 The other silhouette that continues to be a rage this season is the long skirt. Be it the flared gypsy one or the long straight side-slit skirt, the popularity of the garment hasnt waned in the least.

 The sari segment has thrown up a few surprises this Pujas, with chiffons, georgettes and crepes ruling the scene. 

 The look is cocktail, with sequins, stones and embroidery adorning the saris. The traditional fare, too, has a new twist, with silks and taant in Patli-Pallu designs ? the pleats and the pallu wearing a different look from the rest of the body. The filmi focus is evident here, too, with blouses influenced by the Vidya Balan look. The traditional Bengali puff-sleeved blouses are back in style, thanks to Parineeta, says Agnimitra.

 Accessories

 The it item in this segment is the belt, which wears a brand new look this season. Broad cloth tie-on belts worked heavily with mirrors, sequins, shells, metal chips and loads of other embellishments are to be worn with just any garment. Be it a kaftan, a poncho, a skirt, jeans, or even a sari. The belts are a hit with the young crowd. They are flying off the racks at my studio, says Megha. The idea is to go slow on jewellery and let the belts be the focal item.

 If you are a jewellery person, bold and chunky are the keywords for you. So, whether its heavy gold jewellery a la Parineeta, or the Paheli look with semi-precious stones, the bigger the better is the style mantra. But all this only if you are donning complete ethnic gear during the festive days.

 To team up with fusion wear, or for a day wear look, think asymmetrical or geometric shapes ? circles, squares and pentagons ? in vintage brass or shiny silver, combined with glass beads, stones and sequins. Costume jewellery with coloured stones in floral patterns is also in.

 For bags, think beyond leather. Patchworked cloth jholas (again thanks to Bunty Aur Babli) embellished with sequins are quite a rage among the young brigade. For a more sophisticated evening look, the sequinned and stone-studded potlis have replaced the stiff clutch bags.

 The key fashion mantra: mix and match from yesterday and today.

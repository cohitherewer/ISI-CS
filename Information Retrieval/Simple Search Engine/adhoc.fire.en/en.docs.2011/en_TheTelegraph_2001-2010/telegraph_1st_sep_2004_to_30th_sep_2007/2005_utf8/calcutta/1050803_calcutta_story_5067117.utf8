 Five teens go missing

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Five teenagers ? four from the city?s Regent Park area and one from Howrah ? have gone missing in the past four days.

 Mamoni Hazra, Rakesh Hazra, Sonu and Riya Roy, all aged between 12 and 13 and residents of Pirpukur, in the Regent Park police station area, had gone out with an acquaintance, Bishnu Joshi, on Monday morning. After they remained untraced for over 24 hours, the father of Mamoni and Rakesh lodged a missing diary with the police station on Saturday, prompting cops to launch a hunt. 

 ?We are trying to trace the children based on information from our sources. We are keeping all options open but it doesn?t appear to be case of abduction,? said S.N. Gupta, police superintendent of South 24-Parganas. 

 Joshi, who had earlier a rented house at Pirpukur but later shifted to Sonarpur, turned up in the village on Monday morning, and started chatting up the four children. Around 11 am, he invited the four to a long trip. When the kids agreed, he disappeared with them. 

 ?The parents didn?t object, since Joshi was a familiar face and he had given them the word to return soon,? said a Regent Park police station source. When the kids didn?t turn up in the evening, the search began. 

 A team of local people visited Joshi?s house but failed to find him there. A second round of search was carried out. By morning Sunu Hazra, the father of Mamoni and Rakesh, had lodged a complaint. Police claim that Joshi used to be engaged in trafficking children. 

 In Howrah, a 16-year-old boy mysteriously disappeared from his residence. 

 Rajat Chauhan got out of his house in Mahendra Nath Roy Lane, under Howrah police station jurisdiction, around 10 am last Friday. 

 The next day, his parents received a letter from his abductors demanding Rs 5 lakh as ransom within 10 days. His parents lodged a complaint with Howrah police station on Monday night. 

 ?We have launched an all-out investigation into the matter,? said Kalyan Banerjee, additional superintendent of police (town), Howrah.

 Rajat is an unlikely victim. His father, Rajesh Chauhan, is an employee of a lubricant company in the Hooghly Dock area at Salkia, in Howrah. He earns Rs 2,500 a month 

 His mother, Kajal, earns daily wages of Rs 40 at a spice factory.

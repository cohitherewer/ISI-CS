 Starry launch and Turkish delights

Whenever I buy any product, I just look for 

discounts, smiled Mahima Chaudhury as she launched a new range of LG products

He was the first to bring Italian and Mexican cuisine to the city with Kurry Klub. And now chef and restaurateur Pradeep Rozario has taken his novelty quotient a notch higher with KK?s Fusion ? a restaurant and lounge that is serving world cuisine ranging from Greek, Turkish to Italian, Mexican, Indian tandoor and Chinese. 

 The three-month-old plush eatery next to 89 Cinemas is hosting its first food festival ?a Turkish spread that is proving to be Calcutta?s first real exposure to this low-on-spice and high-on-variety fare. 

 ?I wanted to give Calcuttans something that would appeal to their sense of taste. And Turkish food with its range of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes seemed like the right option,? says Rozario. So, you can dig into Grilled Samak (fish) or savour Lahm ki Okra (Mutton with ladyfinger in tomato sauce) and Mixed Fruit Rice. The vegetarian section has lip-smacking options like Turkish Grilled Kebab made from cottage cheese.

 ?Though the essence of this place is innovation and we mix-and-match tastes of different cuisine to create one fusion platter, the Turkish food for the festival has been kept authentic,? claims Rozario. On for dinner and lunch, the festival continues till April 10. 

 Myth amp; matter

 It all originated about six months ago when city-based photographer Leena Kejriwal decided to host some entertaining and innovative workshops. Thus Shivoum was born, an organisation dedicated to bringing arts and creativity closer to people.

 ?Our group of expert teachers organise workshops on subjects ranging from mythology to ballet, painting to architecture,? says Leena. 

 The first workshop on Flamenco dance held in September last year by Spanish teacher Rossanna Maya received a great response. And Shivoum is back with its next round of activities. Indian dance forms are gaining precedence over international styles now. ?So, this time we are having a multi-disciplinary workshop with mythology as a theme, that will depict various mythological characters as well as the rasas of Indian dance forms,? explains Leena. 

 Mandakini Trivedi, who has been a professor of dance for almost a decade in Bombay University, will be giving lecture demonstrations on the romantic mythological hero. 

 ?The participants will be treated to a wholesome combination of dance and myths,? adds Leena. Devdutt Patnaik, a renowned mythologist, will be conducting sessions as well. 

 The workshops will be held on March 9, 11 and 12 at the Padatik Little Theatre on AJC Bose Road. Registration for the workshop can be done through Shivoum on 9830748418.

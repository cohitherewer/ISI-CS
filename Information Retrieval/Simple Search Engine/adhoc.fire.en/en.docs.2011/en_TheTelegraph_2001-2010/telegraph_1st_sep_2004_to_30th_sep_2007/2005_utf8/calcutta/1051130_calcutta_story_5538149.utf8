 Low on show, high on style

 Just when Calcutta was starting to stand up to to its more glamorous counterparts (read, Delhi and Mumbai) with its very own annual fashion extravaganza, the hottest ramp affair has chosen to go missing from the citys winter style calendar.

 For, the organisers of Stylefile have decided to give the fashion show a miss this time. The much-awaited lifestyle event in the citys social diary will be restricted to a one-day exhibition of fashion and art on December 4.

 But the gap will be well filled up, promises Preeti Goenka, one of the ladies behind the joint venture. This will be a totally different experience for Calcutta and once you see it you will not be sad about the ramp show not happening, assures Preeti.

 We have tried out this crossover experience for Mumbai twice in the past and both have been very successful. So, we wanted Calcutta to experience it. Also, this is very much a fashion event; even the art works are on lifestyle objects and not canvases, stresses Sumedha Saraogi, the other half of Stylefile.

 The day-long event titled The Stylefile Exhibition 2005, at The Oberoi Grand Ball Room between 11 am and 7 pm, will showcase designer wear, jewellery, fashion accessories, home decor items and objects dart. 

 The designers displaying their fall-winter collection include big names like Sabyasachi Mukherjee, Anamika Khanna, Kiran Uttam Ghosh, Priyadarshini Rao, Kavita Bhartia, Anjali Kalia, Gauri Bajoria and Sabina Singh.

 Artists who will present their works on unique home decor objects are Arzan Khambatta, Chandra Bhattacharjee, Paresh Maity, Prashant Harlekar, Rajeshree Thakker, Shipra Bhattacharya, Shuvaprasanna and Sunil Padwal. On display will be 100 exquisite pieces like spice boxes, trays, planters, wall decorations, vases and candle stands featuring their artistic touch.

 The idea is to be able to flaunt art all over your home ? your coffee table, dining table and nooks and corners. Art doesnt have to be restricted to framed canvases on your wall, explains Sumedha.

 The exhibition will also have a special display of fusion jewellery by Falguni Mehta, silver ornaments by Uma Khaitan and Bindu Swarup of Regalia, and formal and casual bags by Dipika Sanghi.

 The Calcutta audience will be losing out on the oomph factor on the ramp, but this doesnt seem to make too much of a difference to the designer brigade. 

 Says Kiran Uttam Ghosh: Its true that some people will be disappointed not to be able to see a ramp presentation of the collections, but the exhibition serves our purpose just fine. The idea is to present some great autumn-winter collections from across the country to Calcuttans. True buyers of fashion, I am sure, will queue up from early morning.

 The organisers hold out hope of the catwalk being back next year.

 The original Stylefile format is a ramp show followed by an exhibition the next day. Though this year we are experimenting with a new format, theres no reason to think that we are totally doing away with the fashion show. Itll be back next year, in all likelihood, smiles Sumedha.

 Till then, the Calcutta couture crowd must make do with Stylefile being low on show, high on style.

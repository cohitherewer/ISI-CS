The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cows are gone, the step remains

 - BACK IN A CITY WITH PROBLEMS OF THE WORLD

 Eighteen years may have passed since G?nter Grass? last trip to Calcutta, but it took him only 30 minutes to find his ?Calcutta step? all over again.

 For the German Nobel laureate, coming back to the city where he spent around six months in 1986-87 was ?a little bit like coming home?. This was the city ? contradictions and all ? he had refused to ?whitewash?. And if Show Your Tongue, which the author calls the journal of his stay in town, met with controversy, this didn?t dent his affection for it.

 ?To walk in Calcutta can be a little difficult, but in half an hour, I had found my Calcutta step,? smiled Grass on Tuesday evening, in town for a series of events, including a talk on ?The Segregation of Cultures in the Contemporary World: Clash, Convergence or Cooperation??. He will share the Kala Mandir stage on Thursday with Amitav Ghosh, Lahore-based journalist Najam Sethi and professor T.N. Madan, moderated by Girish Karnad, in an evening organised by Max Mueller Bhavan and The Telegraph.

 While Grass ? who, in addition to being hailed as Germany?s most important living author, is a poet, activist, sculptor and painter ? was finding his feet, he noticed that something was not quite right. ?There was something missing somewhere. I was definitely missing something. Then I realised ? it was the cows! The cows weren?t on the streets any more,? he laughed. Cows in the Calcutta he remembers would serve as a ?traffic regulation?, as they would sit in the middle of the road and no one would touch them.

 Grass may discover in the days to come that cattle haven?t strayed too far from the pasture they have made of the streets of Calcutta. These are the same streets that had widened his perspective. 

 ?It is a city that had the problems of the entire world.? Gandhi?s stay here, Netaji vs Gandhi, Partition of India? this was a ?melting pot of ideas to be discussed?. Its impact has been profound: ?Even when I am not here, my mind keeps racing back.?

 The ?city is growing?, though the ?old machines? can still be spotted everywhere. With ?more and more machines meaning more and more unemployment?, Grass hopes these don?t make it to Calcutta.

 After two days in the city, the 77-year-old appeared at his first public event ? a poetry-reading that featured Grass? work in German and Bengali translation, as well as the verse of Nirendranath Chakravarti, Nabaneeta Dev Sen and Mandakranta Sen.

 The author of The Tin Drum is looking forward to his trip to Baruipur, where he spent much of his last visit. ?I am glad to be going back to the garden house, the gardener, his wife and son. My wife (Ute) has some presents for them.? 

 The gardener, recalls Grass, protected them from the prying eyes of an aggrieved German magazine he had refused an interview.

 In the past, Calcutta may have moved Grass? creativity, but there is no new book on the anvil. He is ?not sure? if he will be writing another work set here. ?But maybe, I will surprise myself.?

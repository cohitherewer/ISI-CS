 City Lights

 Fitness, feel good amp; fun

 Shower or shine, Kamna Saraf and her 12-year-old son hate to miss their thrice-a-week jazz and salsa classes. The mother finds them a fun way to keep fit; her kid just laps up the extra hour of recreation.

 For those in the city just waking up to the joys of dancing, jiving to music is proving an excellent way to de-stress, keep in shape and have fun. And at Vishal Kanoi?s studio off Lansdowne Road, one does not necessarily need nimble feet to learn to dance.

 With a clientele comprising bankers, businessmen, doctors, software engineers, fashion designers and housewives of all ages, Kanoi takes dance classes in separate groups of ?kids, teenagers, ladies and couples?. The module has everything from various versions of jazz to salsa, rock ?n? roll, hip hop, merengue and cha cha cha. Kanoi puts his students through stretching and toning exercises, before jiving to Bollywood and bhangra beats, with a good measure of remix medleys thrown in.

 ?My classes mix entertainment with fitness, so people look forward to them. Besides, they also want to get their steps right when they party. Many like to show off their salsa moves. Kids who take the classes get over their shyness,? says Kanoi, who trained under and performed with Shiamak Davar before starting out on his own.

 ?You need to move in the groove when you are in a discotheque. And I wanted to get my steps right and also stay fit at the same time. Just exercises can be very boring,? concurs Kamna Saraf.

 Beginners start with jazz, salsa and rock ?n? roll, and move on to hip hop and others at the advanced levels. The module spans a month-and-a-half, but many prefer to continue after that. Kanoi teaches three to four batches a day, with each batch counting around 20, and the hours are kept flexible to suit students.

 ?The two hours I spend there are a great way to unwind. I am fresh and full of energy when I return home,? says Ruchira Bajoria, who is busy with her boutique through the day.

 It takes two to Salsa

 If salsa trainers have their way, sprightly Calcuttans would rather take the Latin American route to the dance floor.

 Vive la Salsa, a community formed to promote salsa worldwide, has now come knocking on the Calcuttan?s door, urging him and her to get hooked to this hot dance.

 ?Salsa is a good stress-buster. In Delhi, people are preferring it to gymming as it?s much more fun and interactive,? says trainer Aditya Upadhya of Vive le Salsa, who will conduct a four-day workshop at Hotel Rutt Deen on Loudon Street from October 6. Once the workshop creates a buzz, the organisation will roll out structured weekend classes at the hotel. A kids-only module is also in the pipeline.

 The course content will have basic footwork, partner work and partner turn patterns, styling and moves. ?We had huge success with a workshop at XLRI Jamshedpur which went late into the night. We plan to hold a similar workshop at IIM Calcutta,? says Raghu Upadhya.

 As part of the dance programme, Vive la Salsa will bring Bachata, a popular guitar music from the Dominican Republic, to the city for the first time. Though the emphasis is currently on school and college students, the trainers could soon get the city?s professional circuit dancing to their tune.

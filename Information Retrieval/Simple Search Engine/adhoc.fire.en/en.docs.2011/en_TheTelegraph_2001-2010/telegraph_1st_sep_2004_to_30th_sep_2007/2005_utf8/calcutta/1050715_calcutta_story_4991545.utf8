The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bread, book amp; song 

Calcutta loves its books 

 - Calcuttan top spender in eating out, reading material and music

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Here?s something to chew on ? Calcutta spends more on eating out and on books and music than her fellow metros.

 The Consumer Outlook Survey 2005, conducted by KSA Technopak (Kurt Salmon Associates) across 20 cities, pegs the Calcuttan?s share of the wallet in dining out at 10.8 per cent, against the national average of 6.8 per cent. For books and music, the Calcutta spend is 7.8 per cent, again well above the country mean of 6.1 per cent.

 ?This is an emphatic indication of the opportunities that lie in these areas and Calcutta retailers have been quick to cash in,? says Saloni Nangia, associate director, KSA Technopak. Vacations, savings and home textiles are the other segments where the city has its nose ahead of competition, as revealed in the survey.

 Across the categories of eating out and music and books, the city business fraternity hails the verdict. ?The number of diners must have doubled in the past couple of years,? observes Baba Kothari, president, Hotel and Restaurant Association of Eastern India.

 The proprietor of Bar-B-Q feels Calcutta ?wont look back?, as does Nitin Kohli, director, Grain of Salt, to whom, the KSA study doesn?t come as a surprise. 

 ?The Calcutta market is a new baby and still blooming, whereas Delhi and Mumbai have reached some point of stagnation. With new classy places opening up every other day and more and more people opting to dine out, the euphoria should sustain for another five years at least,? says Kohli, secretary, Restaurant Association of Calcutta Region.

 The city?s love affair with books is best reflected in the vitality of the annual Book Fair, ?the most unique open-air retail congregation in the world?, feels Gautam Jatia of Landmark. 

 ?With its intrinsically-educated population, Calcutta has always been a great market for books, and the same goes for music, with an eclectic taste and penchant to experiment,? he adds.

 Sidharth Pansari of Crossword agrees. ?This still is the intellectual capital of the country and historically, children have always been encouraged to read. Organised retail thrives against the backdrop of College Street and also because Calcuttans are culturally so aware, the romance of the written word will never fade here,? says Pansari.

 The share of books and music in the total spending pie has grown from 5.3 per cent in 2001-02 to 6.1 per cent in 2004-05. In absolute terms, the category has exhibited ?phenomenal growth?, according to Nangia.

 Within regular spends, experiential spends such as films, theatre and music are showing an increasing trend. The share of mobile phone, not surprisingly, is about five times what it was in 2001-02.

 The survey annually covers 10,000 respondents, providing ?definitive and authentic insight? into shopping and spending habits and future outlook. The Consumer Outlook is in its sixth year of running in India and is part of KSA?s global initiative of similar nature in the US, Europe and Japan.

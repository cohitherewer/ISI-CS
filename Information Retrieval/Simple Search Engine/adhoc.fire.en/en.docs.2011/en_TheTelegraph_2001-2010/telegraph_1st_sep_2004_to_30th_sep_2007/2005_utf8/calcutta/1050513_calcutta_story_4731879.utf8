 CU course eyes foreign students

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta University on Thursday decided to introduce a course in business studies from the next academic session, slated to begin in July-August. Five of the 35 seats will be reserved for foreign students.

 Officials say this is the first time the university has opened a ?full-time two-year degree course, master in business administration, with a view to attracting foreign students?. 

 In no other postgraduate course run by the university is there a reservation of seats for foreign students. The total number of seats and the quota for foreign students will be increased over the years.

 ?A study has revealed that there is an increasing demand among students of Saarc countries to pursue studies in financial management. We hope a good number of students from the neighbouring countries will enrol in the new course,? said pro vice-chancellor (academic) Suranjan Das. 

 Officials said the course would be self-financed. An Indian student will have to pay Rs 20,000 per semester and a foreign student, $1,250 dollars.

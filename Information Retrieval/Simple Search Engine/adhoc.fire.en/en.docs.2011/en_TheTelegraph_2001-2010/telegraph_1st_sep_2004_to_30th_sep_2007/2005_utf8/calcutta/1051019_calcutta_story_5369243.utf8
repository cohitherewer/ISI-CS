 The goddess herself is getting overshadowed by the flurry of theme-based pujas. The pandals and lights are for Devi Durga, not the other way round. It is true that a couple of years ago, we too had veered towards themes. But it was sad to hear people say that they come to see Dilwara temple (which we had replicated) and not the idol. A puja need not become a platform for art. It is true organisers are under pressure to stay in the prize race. But last year, when we shunned themes, we won two major prizes ? one for the idol and the other for organisation. And our sponsors never meddle in whether it is a traditional or a theme puja. If the idol is beautiful, nothing else is required ? no gimmickry of pandal materials or theme.

 Time not ripe for terminal

 - Passenger dispersal system falters, funds crunch cited 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The fate of the much-hyped third railway terminal at Chitpur, slated to be operational from late 2005, became uncertain as the government failed to develop the passenger dispersal system.

 Eastern Railway officers said work on their part of the project, including building a station, platforms with all amenities and track repair, providing drinking water, sewerage and sanitation, is on in full swing, and already about Rs 100 crore has been spent. 

 The Chitpur railway terminal was planned as an alternative to the overcrowded Sealdah station. Then railway minister Nitish Kumar had announced the project in 2002. 

 According to the understanding between the state government and Eastern Railway, the state will take the responsibility of improving the passenger dispersal system, including road connectivity and transportation, and the railway will help construct station buildings, lay tracks and provide passenger amenities. 

 ?We are running as per schedule and work on the project is on in full swing. We are ready to ply trains from May, as decided,?? said chief operating manager of Eastern Railway Subhas Thakur.

 But, officials said, the new terminal could not be put into operation as the state government has not developed the infrastructure to enable passengers to reach the station.

 The road alongside Circular and New Cut canals, from BT Road to Beleghata and on to the EM Bypass, has been earmarked as the main passenger dispersal route.

 In the first phase, the state government will have to repair and widen Canal East, Canal West and Canal South roads, construct a small flyover and an underpass. The estimated cost is Rs 67 crore. 

 The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Agency and Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC) were assigned the job. Work has just started after the HRBC allotted Rs 8 crore to repair Canal East Road. 

 ?It needs at least Rs 200 crore to build a proper passenger dispersal system. Where will we get the funds from? We could have completed the work in time if the total investment was Rs 5-10 crores,?? urban development secretary K.S. Rajendrakumar said on Wednesday. 

 ?If the railway does not provide any funds, it is impossible for us to bear the entire burden,? he added.

 He could not give any assurance when the project will be completed. Engineers said it could take at least six months.

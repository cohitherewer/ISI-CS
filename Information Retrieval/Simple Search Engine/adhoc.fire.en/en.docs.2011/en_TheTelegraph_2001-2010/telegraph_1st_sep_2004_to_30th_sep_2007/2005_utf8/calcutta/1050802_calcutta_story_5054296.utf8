 Games, interface to grant life skills

 Session 6: Advertisements for a telecom service provider and for a fairness cream are played in a class. Children are made to assess which of the two they like and why. The facilitator uses the responses to steer the discussion towards ?good ads? and ?bad ads?. Each group is then asked to make a good and a bad ad. They are also encouraged to maintain a scrapbook of all good and bad ads. In the process, they learn what is acceptable to them. 

 Session 8: A class is divided into groups. The students are told they are marooned on an island. They are asked to make a list of 10 must-haves for survival. They?re allowed only three. As the role-playing continues, children learn to prioritise between their needs and wants.

 Gone are the days when moral science was taught from textbooks, the rights and wrongs spelt out in black and white. Value education has a new form, which encourages children to discover their value systems through games, role-playing and interactivity.

 A few city schools like Lakshmipat Singhania Academy, Birla High School for Girls, Akshar, Learnium and Vidyanjali are practising the method.

 Comprising a total of 16 sessions to be taught over a year, the programme is called ?Footprints ? Small Steps for a Big Cause?, designed by Child Relief and You (CRY) and Education and Technology Services Ltd. 

 The sessions, particularly for Classes VI and VII, when children are about to enter adolescence, make them aware of their rights, of the equality of one and all, and of larger issues like media influence, child labour, water conservation, discrimination and war and peace, without lectures.

 Anjali Razdan, principal, Lakshmipat Singhania Academy, says: ?The method is not judgmental. For instance, the same thing can be good or bad at different times. ?Footprints? helps build life skills, which enable a child to take the right decision on his own.? 

 Sharmila Bose, principal, Birla High School for Girls, adds: ?It makes a child accountable to himself, which is far more effective than telling him what to do or what not to do.?

 The programme is also an attempt at combating the growing materialism among affluent children. CRY spokesperson Mohua Chatterjee says: ?We do not want the child to feel guilty for being privileged, but we want him to realise that there is more to life.? 

 Leslie D?Gama, of Education and Technology Services Ltd, says: ?It is a sustained system and the results will surface over the years.?

 Sreelekha Mitra in performance: Dance dance. Pictures by Aranya Sen

 What do the stars do behind the scenes? What happens during shooting? Is it more work or play? Well, a section of the city?s star-struck crowd did get some of the answers at the Rabindra Sarobar stadium this Sunday with a ?live cinema? show.

 Beating the blazing sun, thousands of fans thronged the grounds for an eyeful of the stars ruling their cable homes, night and day. The backbenchers, dissatisfied with a bird?s eye-view of the performers on the makeshift open-air stage, abandoned their seats and scurried forward to squat on the ground, even whipping out umbrellas and munchies.

 The show was slated for 2 pm, but minutes flew with the stage being readied. Finally, it was time for a bunch of actors and actresses to show their audience what goes into the making of a film in Tollywood. Called Janto Chalochchitra, the show was part of the daylong Poila Mela organised by ETV Bangla.

 The scene of action was a shooting spot, furnished with all the gadgets ? camera on a trolley, boom and lights. It all started with a producer (Kharaj Mukherjee) out to trap an unsuspecting moneybag into funding a masala movie. The fun started when the suburban trader, played quite convincingly by TV serial-maker Jishu Dasgupta, arrived at the shooting site to keep an eye on the goings-on. From the self-obsessed heroine to the snooty hero, the modest villain to the hapless spot boy, the incorrigible trouble-maker to the hassled director, there was every character worth a sample. The script was tight and hilarious, and even took a dig at the film-making process.

 Locket Chatterjee: Green glory

 After Sreelekha Mitra set the ball rolling with a sizzling dance number, a traditional tear-jerker of an emotional scene actually found Dipankar De, Rita Koyral and Locket Chatterjee misreading their lines and cracking jokes. As a gawky Dasgupta stared on, the sari-clad, sindoor-smudged Locket walked in wearing a slick black outfit, smoking a cigarette. Next, Pallavi Chatterjee rushed in with a bunch of goons led by Rajesh Sharma on her heels. Enter, Abhishek Chatterjee on a bike, beating the bad men black and blue before breaking into a jig with the damsel no longer in distress.

 The stunt scene was left to macho man Tota Roy Chowdhury, who crashed through a wall (made of thermocol) to save Sreelekha Mitra and her father Dipankar De from the clutches of villain Bharat Kaul. The comedy cuts were reserved for Shubhasish Mukherjee.

 What made the show, close to two hours, special was the wholehearted participation of all backstage hands, from the spotboy to the lightman, make-up artiste to hairdresser.

 Scripted by Rangan Chakraborty, the skit was directed by film-maker Subrata Sen (Ek Je Achhe Konya, Nil Nirjane) and executed by Golden Moments.

 James Spader: Top notch

 Abstract visual music

 A painter, printmaker and muralist of extraordinary talent, as well as a competent art historian, late Amina Ahmed Kar specialised in non-figurative, abstract visual compositions. The ongoing exhibition presents an anthology of her works, created before she took self-exile from the art world. Generally cryptic and ambiguous in design, her works are spiritually rich. Springing from the Jungian collective unconsciousness, her paintings appear to be fragments of dreams and memories and, at times, deeply introspective interpretations of everyday happenings. From them, unseen and unobserved shapes emerge, that are organically woven into her compositions. Kar?s rendition of geometric imagery is unique. In some of her works, non-figurative structures within shapes are exposed with verve and skill, while in others, there are remnants of figures embedded on the surface. Appearing at one moment and disappearing the next, they are similar to the notes of music, light and fluid in texture, yet contributing to the total visual harmony.

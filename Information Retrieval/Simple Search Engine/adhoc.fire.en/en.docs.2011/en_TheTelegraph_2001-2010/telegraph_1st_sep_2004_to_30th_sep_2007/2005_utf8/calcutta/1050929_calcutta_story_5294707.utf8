 Expressions of identity

 Turkish-German cinema has proved to be immensely enriching for the general film culture in Germany. In its paradoxical combination of familiarity and foreignness, of understanding and obstinacy, it allows the viewer to take a close look at the social reality of the country; a look that German cinema in its core is in danger of losing. Present, third generation Turkish migrants can neither completely withdraw into the illusion of returning to their homeland, nor find acceptance in mainstream society. The ongoing series of screenings of films on third generation Turkish-Germans voice their experiences as they search for identity and assimilation. They tell stories of alienation and rootlessness, about the yearning for freedom and for a homeland, and of living in two cultures but belonging to neither. To be screened today: Lola and Billy the Kid (direction: Kutlug Ataman); tomorrow: Tour Abroad (direction: Ayse Polat); October 1: Head On (direction: Fatih Akin).

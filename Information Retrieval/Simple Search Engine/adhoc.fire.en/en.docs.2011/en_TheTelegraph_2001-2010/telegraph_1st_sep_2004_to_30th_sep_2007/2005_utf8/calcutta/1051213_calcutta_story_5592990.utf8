 Suspend 

slap for five cops

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 Five police officials held responsible for the escape of six undertrials from the court premises in Salt Lake?s Mayukh Bhavan on Thursday, have been suspended.

 Police had managed to round up the fugitives in a hurry, but the officials were suspended on Monday for gross negligence of duty. 

 ?A departmental inquiry revealed that an assistant sub-inspector, three constables and a home guard on duty had failed to keep a watch on the undertrials. They were suspended after the preliminary enquiry report submitted by the additional superintendent of police of Salt Lake held them responsible,? said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas.

 The six men ? Ziaul Laskar, Rabiul Laskar, Hasan Laskar, Shaidul Mandal, Tinku Rai and Pintu Rai ? had slipped out of the court compound around 5.30 pm last Thursday after engaging in a mock fight and catching the cops off-guard.

 Five were re-arrested the same night, while Rabiul was picked up from his residence at Kakdwip on Sunday.

 ?We are checking out how prisoners can be taken out more securely from the court compound,? said SP Kumar.

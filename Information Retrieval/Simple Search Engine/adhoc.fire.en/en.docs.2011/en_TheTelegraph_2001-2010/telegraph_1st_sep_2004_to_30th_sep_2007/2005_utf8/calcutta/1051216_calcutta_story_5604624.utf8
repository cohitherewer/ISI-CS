 Xmas wows

 With Christmas knocking on the door, the Yuletide spirit is on a high. In keeping with the mood of the season, Sasha, at 27, Mirza Ghalib Street, plays host to Sasha Christmas Festival till December 24.

 The festival was inaugurated by actress June (picture by Aranya Sen) on Wednesday and followed by an audio-visual presentation by Madhumita Sinha of Panchachuli Women Weavers, enlightening the audience on the production of Pashmina shawls, the finish, the dyeing, and the hands that create them.

 The exhibition showcases handwoven Pashmina and lamb wool shawls, stoles and other woollen items by Panchachuli Women Weavers. Then you have an antique range of tribal silver jewellery sourced from the villages by Mahua Sarkar Sen. Also on offer are handcrafted bamboo and madur grass products.

 Christmas decorations include candles from Silence and Asha Niketan, tree decorations in the shape of bells and balls, angels and doves, hearts and embroidered Christmas cards. The price tag starts at Rs 40. The exhibition is an exclusive selection of crafts and gift ideas, says store executive Stella Mardi.

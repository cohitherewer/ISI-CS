 Neha Dhupia: 

 Pak-ing in

 When Neha Dhupia signed a Pakistani film, the word doing the rounds was how much she would be allowed to expose, considering her dare-bare track record in films like Julie and Sheesha. But surprisingly, the dance number picturised on Neha in the Lollywood production had her wearing a wardrobe of clothes.

 The film titled Kabhi Pyaar Na Karna is in fact an Indo-Pak co-production with the Pakistani film production company Kawaja Tariq-Ul-Fazal Tahir joining hands with Indian film producer Sheet Srivastava?s Overall Entertainment. While Neha only appears in a dance number, the film stars Pakistani actors Muammar Rana and Zara Sheikh. Muammar had earlier done a cameo in the Jackie Shroff-Mahima Chaudhuri-Raveena Tandon-starrer Dobara.

 Neha, who got to shoot in Mumbai for the Kabhi Pyaar Na Karna dance number, really enjoyed working with the Pakistani team. ?It was a great experience and we worked very well together,? she messaged Metro from London. ?They were very warm people and it almost felt like family. We shot for just four days and each time I think of the schedule, it brings a smile back on my face.?

 You do not have to be Narain Karthikeyan to have Sachin Tendulkar come and watch you play. That too with Shah Rukh Khan for company. That is what six Calcuttans found out on a Sunday morning in Mumbai. 

 The occasion was the final of AirTel Showdown, a campaign launched by the mobile service provider, where teams captained by the two celebrities took the field. 

 The fun trip unfolded on a note of surprise. ?I was working in office when I got a call from a voice claiming to be June?s telling me that I was to fly to Mumbai and have lots of fun.? For a while, Nivedita Bhattacharya took it to be a prank before the reality sunk in. 

 The 25-year-old mother of one took the flight with five others the next Sunday morning. Souvik Roy, a teacher of microbiology in Sarsuna College, played alongside her in the team. 

 ?Sachin came to meet us at the Taj Land?s End in Bandra and we had pictures taken with him,? recalled Souvik. ?The match took place in Film City, Goregaon, where Shah Rukh and Sachin joined us.? 

 The finale was also marked by the launch of King Khan?s Den and Master Blaster?s Pavilion ? a mobile fan club and exclusive content zone on the two superstars on Airtel Live. While King Khan?s Den was launched by Sachin, Shah Rukh inaugurated the Master Blaster?s pavilion. AirTel customers can log onto http://live.airtelworld. com to access the content.

 After international accolades in cinema, it?s time for desi television to be recognised in phoren territories. Smriti Irani, the K-bahu, recently became the first Indian to be invited as jury member in the mini-series segment of the 45th Monte Carlo International Television Festival. 

 The rest of the jury consisted of representatives from Poland, Japan, England and Lebanon and was headed by noted Polish film-maker Krzysztof Zanussi, who has been a regular visitor to the Kolkata Film Festival.

 Smriti not only got the chance to explore the international television programming patterns but was also invited to present a case to David Tomatis, vice president of the festival for the need to create awareness about the event in India. She also spoke to the festival?s honourary president Prince Albert II ? recently announced the ruler of Monaco ? in great detail about the television boom in our country.

 If that wasn?t enriching enough, Smriti became great friends with some truly global names in the world of showbiz ? Carol Drinkwater, a celebrated theatre and TV star and Ibolya Fekete, a Hungarian film director who is also the first recipient of the Satyajit Ray Award.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Screen On amp; Off

Those we miss the most on the big screen

Dream girls all, but not on celluloid. They rule the 

tennis court, stride the political stage, play games off the soccer pitch, write 

up a storm, rock the ramp... Metro urges them not to give the movies the miss!

 Faria Alam could so easily play the seductress in a crossover 

film rather than manage the English soccer manager

Ritu Beri should take a break from dressing up the fashionable 

people and take Bollywood by storm

 Priyanka Gandhi isn?t doing too badly as Congress heir, but 

we hope she doesn?t wait till Brinda Karat age to dabble in the politics of screen 

stardom

 If only Anna Kournikova had realised that tennis was not her 

thing, tinsel town would have found a blonde bimbette to boast of

 Maria Sharapova may be the best tennis player around but wonder 

how many flock to see her forehand and how many to gape at her good looks. Oh 

Maria, when do we see you play the Bond babe?

Jhumpa Lahiri could have done Mira Nair such a huge favour playing 

Ashima herself in Namesake

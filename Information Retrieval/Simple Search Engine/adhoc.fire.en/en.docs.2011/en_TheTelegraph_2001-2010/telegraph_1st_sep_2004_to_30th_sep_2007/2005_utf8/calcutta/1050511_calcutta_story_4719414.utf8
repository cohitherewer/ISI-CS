The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 The boulevard along Southern Avenue, between the junctions of Bompas Road and 

Lake Place, has been permanently destroyed. A huge brick and concrete structure, 

resembling a warehouse, with a hideous 12ft-high wall has come up here. The Calcutta 

Municipal Corporation is constructing a indoor swimming pool here without consulting 

the local residents. This, despite more than one swimming pool in the vicinity, 

near Rabindra Sarobar. This is a blatant defiance of citizen and environment-friendly 

town planning. Can this not be avoided? 

 Name not given, 

Southern Avenue. 

 All kinds of information are found scribbled on currency notes in our country. 

At banks, post offices and telephone bill-receiving counters, employees keep count 

of notes by scribbling the figure on top of the bundle to keep track of the money 

received. Bus conductors are also seen folding the currency notes into all shapes 

and sizes. All these reduce the longevity of the notes. No wonder, there is always 

a long queue at Reserve Bank of India for exchange of soiled notes. The government 

should campaign against this defilement of currency notes and introduce a ban 

on currency notes that have been written on. Automatically, people will stop the 

practice and also refuse to accept such notes from others.

 The halkhata ceremony on the Bengali New Year?s Day at Kalighat and 

Dakshineswar end in chaos because of overcrowding. Such unruly atmosphere, with 

jostling and petty quarrels, totally negates the spirit of the occasion. The local 

administration should have better crowd management at both the venues. 

 B.N. Bose, 

Dum Dum Park. 

 A few weeks back, I noticed a small neon signboard on top of the main gate 

of Goenka College, in Bowbazar, which read ?100 years celebration ? 1905-2004?. 

I learnt from the college office that the institution was founded on Nov 27, 1905. 

In that case, it would be turning 100 only this year. I hope that the confusing 

display on the signboard would be rectified.

 Apropos ?Facility hitch despite higher fare? in the monthly Point Counterpoint 

in this column on February 21, the letter seems to have had its effect. Mobile 

charging points are a reality now in AC 2-tier and 3-tier compartments. On May 

2, I found the facility available in Falakhnama Express. However, there is room 

for improvement of the quality of the plugpoints.

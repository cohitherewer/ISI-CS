 Drawing inspiration from the universal elements of fire, ice and earth, the NiFD (National Institute of Fashion Design) students from Jamshedpur displayed their creative talent in a presentation of their graduating collections on Saturday at the institutes Lindsay Street centre.

 The work showed off innovative western and ethnic cuts and styles of 127 students marking their entry into the professional world of fashion.

 Fire, the first sequence, captured the theme through symbolic colour. In a bright combination of reds and yellows, the style was typical of Gujarat, featuring banjaras combining an ethnic touch with a modern twist, the same effect achieved by mirror work on capris.

 Next came the Ice sequence, which unfolded ensembles in soothing whites. Using surface ornamentation and embellishments like sequins and aluminium foil, the collection stood in stark contrast with the shows early vibrance. Shades of pink, mauve, yellow, violet and lime green were also seen here.

 The final sequence was the earthy round with an array of colours like sky blue, sea-green, mauve, golden, yellow, pink and peach. The serenity of nature was the theme reflected in kaftan-like short garments with asymmetrical hemlines, embellished with beads, sequins, mirrors, flowers and bells. 

 The students were thrilled by the end result of all their efforts. We have used simple fabrics to create wonders. The designs have been conceptualised completely by us. Satin has been used on the fabric front for the Earth and Ice collections, while the Fire sequence uses georgette, some of the students explained.

 Tradition in the form of saris also came through in sugared pastels, yellow, orange, turquoise, red, white and pink ruling the colour roost.

 Crash course for drivers

 - Monday debut for training in road rules and traffic norms

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 The state transport department is organising training sessions for the drivers of private buses and minibuses.

 The decision was taken at a recent meeting transport minister Subhas Chakraborty held with senior officials to discuss ways to prevent road mishaps, on the rise of late.

 According to the plan, the sessions will be conducted by the Calcutta State Transport Corporation (CSTC) and the drivers will be trained in batches in various camps. The first camp, to be held on Monday at the CSTC?s Lake depot, will be joined by 70 drivers.

 ?The sessions will include lessons in driving, automobile mechanism, engine maintenance, and checking of fuel, radiator and engine temperature,? said CSTC managing director Ashok Bhattacharya. ?The drivers will also be taught about motor vehicle laws, traffic rules and pollution norms. After completion of the training, they will be issued certificates.??

 The camps will be held across the city, to be joined by 100 to 150 drivers. The transport department aims to train at least 10,000 drivers a year. 

 Though targeted primarily at drivers of private buses and minibuses, drivers of state buses whose records are not satisfactory will also be enrolled for the training.

 According to transport department officials, at least half the 30,000-odd drivers on various routes in and around the city are not fit for the job. Either they have not been properly trained or do not have the physical promptness required of a driver. Moreover, they know almost nothing about motor mechanics and road rules.

 ?As the drivers are engaged by operators, we do not have any say in their recruitment. There is also no system in the transport department to verify their efficiency, said a senior official. Despite poor knowledge of driving, they obtain licences by ?managing? public vehicles department officials. 

 ?A major reason for rising road accidents and violation of traffic rules is inefficiency of the drivers,? the official added. 

 Bus operators, too, feel that road accidents and flouting of traffic rules will be reduced if the drivers get proper training. 

 ?No driver intends to knock down or run over a pedestrian. That they do is because they are not trained. Also, some drivers indulge in racing with others,? said the president of Bengal Bus Syndicate, Swarnakamal Saha.

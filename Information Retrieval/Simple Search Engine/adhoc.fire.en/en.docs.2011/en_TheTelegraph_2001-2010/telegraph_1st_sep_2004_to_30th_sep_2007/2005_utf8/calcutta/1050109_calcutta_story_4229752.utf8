Tsunami you have brought us closer to God

We believe in Him now, more than ever before

From all the grief, tears and pain

Will rise again

A new world united in hope

And love again.

 Usha Uthup?s words, in a nutshell, summed up the gamut of emotions on display at Calcutta?s own Live Aid for tsunami victims, Our Planet, Our Life amp; Our Duty.

 Organised by Oxford Bookstore, the five-hour-long non-stop musical medley on the Apeejay Lawns was able to generate more funds than the combined efforts of many city clubs. 

 Some of the biggest and brightest forces of Calcutta?s music fraternity got together to do their bit for the countless lives snatched and savaged by the killer waves.

 It all started off with a new fusion band, Class Apart, which brought together two generations and two schools of musicians in Pandit Santanu Bandopadhyay and Neel Adhikary. 

 The jugalbandi worked well as pedestrians stopped in their tracks and crowded the Park Street pavement. The Raghupati Raghava number was the highlight of the session with eastern and western vocal strains striking a chord in unison.

 Wired was the next act as it rendered classic rock numbers. Let the music play and So glad you made it went down well but it was the popular Friends theme track I?ll be there for you that provided the maximum food for thought.

 Oxford volunteers were all over Park Street with their donation boxes and the contributions poured in, and in all colours ? rupees, pounds and dollars.

 The fund-raising initiative by the bookstore had started last week with drop boxes placed at the cash counters of the store across the country.

 As always, the highlight of Krosswindz?s performance was Tuki?s (Vikramjit) solo guitar act. The group mostly sang original numbers including the popular One world and Bengali tracks like Shundori kanya.

 The Dutts took over next. Father Anjan and son Neel took the stage with their guitars as requests for popular numbers like Bela Bose and Ranjana flooded the greens. But it was time for Blowin? in the wind as everyone present joined hands as a mark of support for the victims.

 Marianne followed, resulting in reassuring smiles on the faces of people lining the street. Neel followed his father?s act as he belted out a solo rendition of Bangladeshi singer Maqsood?s Majhi, which told the sad tale of a boatman caught in the waters.

 The two Neels, Dutt and Adhikary, then got together for a Neel amp; Neel gig with Imagine and Salt water.

 The contribution count soared in a big way when senior Dutt and Tuki personally went up to all the onlookers requesting them to donate for the cause. ?We are singing just for you to pitch in with your contributions,? they said.

 It was left to Ushadi to urge everyone to come together in this moment of crisis. ?We will stand hand in hand, bring peace throughout the land, fill us with love we pray, guide us oh Lord show us the way,? sang Usha Uthup. Eyes moistened and hands reached for wallets.

 The finale came in the form of Kolkata, Kolkata as Park Street came to a halt and voices joined chords to respond to the call of humanity.

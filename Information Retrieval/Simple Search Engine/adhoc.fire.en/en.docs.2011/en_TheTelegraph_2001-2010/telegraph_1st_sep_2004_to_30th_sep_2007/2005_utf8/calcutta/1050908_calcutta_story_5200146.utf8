 Rustlers on the roads of Calcutta? It may not be enough to lure cowboy legend Sudden to our streets, but a gang is getting the goat of cattle traders with its midnight swoops.

 Goons out to make a quick buck are using Tata Sumos, revolvers and the cover of darkness to block the path of goats or lambs lumbering down streets at night, lifting some of them into the vehicle and speeding away.

 A hard night?s day was enabling the goat gang to pocket anything between Rs 3 lakh and Rs 5 lakh, police said.

 The lid was blown off this latest form of hold-up a few days ago with the arrest of four gang members from near Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport.

 The arrest was a fallout of intensified vigil following police complaints lodged by three traders on how they had been robbed of their valuable animals.

 ?We have so far received three complaints and a group of goons, including the mastermind, has already been arrested,? said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner (I) of police, detective department.

 One of the complainants, Sheikh Moidul, narrated how he and two others were travelling down CIT Road one night with a Matador van full of lambs when they were stopped by a Tata Sumo that overtook them.

 ?A youth jumped out and whipped out a revolver. Then, he and one of his associates, who also emerged from the Tata Sumo, picked up a few lambs, walked back to the vehicle and sped away,? Moidul told the cops.

 Police say around 5,000 animals are moved through different parts of Calcutta every day ? mostly from late night to early morning ? to wholesalers and slaughter houses.

 Damayanti Sen, deputy commissioner (north division), agreed that robbing goats and lambs from city streets was a new crime trend.

 ?Among the arrested four, none is a professional criminal. The mastermind, identified as Pramod Majumder, alias Sanjay, from Baranagar, has a car-rental business. He used his car to steal the goats.?

 Elaborating on the modus operandi, another officer added: ?After the first attack, they shift the animals to a waiting van. After five or six swoops, they leave the city with animals worth a few lakh.?

 Police, however, admitted they have little information about these goons. ?It appears they are from the fringe areas of North 24-Parganas, Hooghly, Howrah and South 24-Parganas,? said an officer.

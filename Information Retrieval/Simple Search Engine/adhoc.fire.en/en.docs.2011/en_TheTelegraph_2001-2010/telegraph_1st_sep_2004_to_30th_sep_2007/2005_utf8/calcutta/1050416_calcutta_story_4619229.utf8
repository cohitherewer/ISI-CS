 Lives of eminence on CD

 - National Library eyes archive on Nobel laureates amp; others

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The National Library will set up an archive to preserve audio-visual material on the life and works of ?eminent personalities? like Amartya Sen and Suchitra Mitra.

 ?We have so far been gathering books and journals. And our collection boasts around 30 lakh of them. Now, we?ve decided to set up an archive to store the life and works of eminent personalities on celluloid. These personalities will speak for themselves and narrate their achievements,? said library director Sudhendu Mandal.

 ?The city has produced five Nobel laureates. Anyone can gather information about them from books or journals. But it is difficult to get hold of documentaries or short films in which these Nobel laureates speak about their life and work. Our measures aim at capturing the moods and achievements of such personalities and others,? he added.

 The culture department of the Union government has recently approved the proposal and sanctioned Rs 10 lakh for the project. More help has been assured for successful completion of the project.

 A senior library official said the authorities have decided to interview Amartya Sen, his mother Amiya Sen, Rabindrasangeet exponent Suchitra Mitra and academician Pratap Chandra Chunder.

 They also want to interview political personalities but are not certain whether they will get the Centre?s nod. ?If allowed, we will talk to Jyoti Basu and Phulrenu Guha, veteran Gandhian and freedom fighter,? the official added.

 Mandal, too, confirmed that interviewing politicians would require consent from the Centre. ?We cannot decide on our own. We have to seek permission from the department of culture.? 

 A new department ? oral history division ? has been set up to preserve the audio-visual material. 

 An official said the material will be preserved on compact discs (CDs). Any scholar or visitor will be allowed access to the treasure trove. 

 Though the National Library Staff Association has welcomed the proposal, it has expressed displeasure over the authorities? failure to fill up the vacant posts. 

 ?It will be difficult to run the department with the present staff strength. We have 781 sanctioned posts, of which 265 have been vacant since 1993. The Centre has cleared appointments to 11 posts, but none of the recruits has joined so far,? pointed out an association leader.

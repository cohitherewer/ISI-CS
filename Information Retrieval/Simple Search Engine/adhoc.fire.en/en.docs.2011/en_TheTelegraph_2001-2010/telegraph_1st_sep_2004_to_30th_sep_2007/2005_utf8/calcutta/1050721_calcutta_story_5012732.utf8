 Hormone therapy paves cancer path

 SAHELI MITRA

 The increased fascination for hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is one of the main factors leading to breast cancer among urban women, says R.A. Badwe, chief of surgery and breast service, Tata Memorial Hospital.

 Speaking at a seminar on ?Breast cancer: should we be worrying about it??, organised by BP Poddar Hospital, Badwe said: ?Breast cancer cases are on the rise because of hormonal imbalances. An increased fascination for HRT among the city?s upper and upper middle-class women is proving dangerous.?

 ?I was asked by a reputed beauty clinic to undergo HRT to reduce wrinkles and five years down the line, I ended up at a chemotherapy unit, diagnosed with early stages of breast carcinoma. My oncologist said it was the result of a hormonal imbalance induced by HRT,? says 45-year-old housewife Anoushka Sinha.

 In Calcutta, the most frequently reported malignancy among women is breast cancer (22.7 per cent), followed by uterine and cervical cancer (17.5 per cent), cancer of the gall bladder (6.4 per cent) and ovary (5.8 per cent). 

 Narayan Bhattacharya, chief medical officer of BP Poddar Hospital, reveals: ?Of the total number of patients admitted daily to our hospital, almost one-fourth are breast carcinoma cases.? 

 ?Contrary to popular belief that oral contraception causes breast cancer among urban women, it is HRT that?s the real culprit,? adds Bhattacharya.

 Badwe?s statistics also indicate that one out of every 30 urban women falls prey to breast cancer, compared to one out of 60 in rural India. Developing countries like India make up almost 50 per cent of global breast cancer figures.

 City oncologist Chanchal Goswami warns: ?Urban women above 40 should never neglect any painless lump in their breasts, as in 80 per cent of such cases, the lumps turn out to be malignant.?

 Factors like lack of breast-feeding among working mothers, obesity attributed to a wrong diet and a sedentary lifestyle, increased reproductive life span, late pregnancies due to late marriages also contribute to the increased incidence of breast carcinoma among urban women.

 According to Indian Cancer Society, age-specific incidence rates of breast cancer for most of the urban population in India were found to chart a steep rise till the menopause years.

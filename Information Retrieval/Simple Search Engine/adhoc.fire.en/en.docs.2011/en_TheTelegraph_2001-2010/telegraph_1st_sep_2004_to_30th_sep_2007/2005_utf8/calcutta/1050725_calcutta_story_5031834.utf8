The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Written on her forehead

 Jennifer Connelly with co-actor Ariel Gade in Dark Water, and (below) with husband Paul Bettany

 Jennifer Connelly studied Chinese, worked with Sergio Leone and modelled in high-profile ad campaigns ? all before reaching puberty. As an adult she wins Oscars, wakes up every morning next to Paul Bettany and stars in some of Hollywood?s most challenging films.

 The seriously talented ? and very serious ? actress? latest film Dark Water is a clever psychological thriller by the Brazilian director Walter Salles. Connelly plays the main character, Dahlia, a recently separated single mother who moves with her young daughter into a horrific tower block in Roosevelt Island, New York. 

 The flat is filthy and cramped, the lift has a mind of its own, thuggish teenagers roam the darkened corridors and in the foyer sits a sinister caretaker played by Pete Postlethwaite. The forces of evil are, of course, soon unleashed, mainly in the form of bad plumbing. Dark red water pours through the ceilings, the pipes spurt violently, lavatories flush without warning, washing machines explode, a bathroom tap runs with human hair? 

 ?I saw a near-to-final cut in an editing room on a little monitor,? Connelly says, frequently moving her tongue over her teeth and lips, tasting the air like a snake.

 ?The editor was waiting outside and Bill Mechanic, the producer, was looking in at me and waiting. Among people who know me, I am a really notoriously harsh critic, especially of my own stuff. So they are standing there with this look of dread, and I came out and I said, ?I like it. I really like it.? I mean, I was really surprised!?

 Connelly is right to be pleased with the film. This is the biggest part she has played since winning an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her role as the wife of the brilliant but mad mathematician John Nash in A Beautiful Mind (2001).

 She is very good at portraying emotionally frail, complex characters as well as brilliantly conveying the finer nuances of feeling. This works rather well in a horror film like Dark Water. And there is that extra feature in her face: a forked vein down the centre of the forehead that protrudes at moments of stress. 

 ?Walter was obsessed with that,? she laughs, stroking her forehead with one finger. ?He loved the vein and when I got upset it would pop out and he would go, ?Oh yeah, that?s perfect. I love it.??

 As Dark Water is a film about maternal love, Walter Salles wanted Connelly, who is 34, to play Dahlia partly because the actress has children of her own: Kia, aged seven, whose father is the American photographer David Dugan, and Stellan, aged nearly two, whom she had with her husband Bettany. 

 One of the real strengths of the film, and what lifts the otherwise gloomy tone of the proceedings, is the extraordinary bond between Connelly and her on-screen daughter Ceci, played by Ariel Gade.There are wonderful small touches of domestic familiarity ? the way mother and daughter nestle together on the sofa, how they link little fingers in the lift, how Dahlia holds Ceci up in the air so that she can put away a pan in the kitchen.

 Does she dissect every scene and every sentence as she once did with the literary texts? Connelly says she doesn?t. But she remains unforthcoming about the process of acting. ?I dunno. Walter was great to talk to and run ideas by and... I just tried different things.?

 Waking the Dead is an agonisingly sad love story. Darren Aronofsky?s Requiem for a Dream, where she plays a desperate drug addict who descends into the most depraved prostitution, is harrowing to watch. So, too, is Vadim Perelman?s beautiful film The House of Sand and Fog which ends with a double suicide.

 But now we are apparently in for a change. This time, when the actress returns to America, she will start filming something a little lighter: a satire about suburban angst directed by Todd Field. And soon, Connelly says, she would like to branch out into comedy.

 From someone so serious and self-improving, it?s a dumbfounding suggestion. But Connelly is a technically excellent actress and sense of humour has always counted for far less than determination. So, no doubt, we will see her centrestage in some uproarious romantic comedy pretty soon.

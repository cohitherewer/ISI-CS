The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The female aspect of divinity

 Durga is probably one of the world?s most powerful symbols of shakti, of yin, of raw divine female energy. Taken in the abstract form, it?s something that our culture and history has been able to preserve. Throughout the world, you can trace back to a time when female divinity was worshipped.

 But in most cultures, that was slowly superseded by very male-centric, less abstract religions and beliefs. The fact that Hindu culture, at very primal levels (though not always through its treatment of real-life women) has preserved and continued to worship the female aspect of divinity is something truly beautiful.

 I regret that I have never been in Calcutta for Durga puja, as it sounds like probably one of the most sensory and celebratory experiences possible.

 Only once, when I was in Delhi, did I go to celebrate Durga puja. I was seven years old and had no idea what to expect.

 I was overwhelmed by the crowd and the atmosphere, by the raw devotion and the festive mood. Not knowing what to expect, I was taken completely by surprise when I was thrust into a central area where a few people were dancing. I remember feeling very self-conscious and just wanting to get back out.

 But people insisted that I dance and a man came and handed me two large steaming pots with embers in them. So I held them and started to dance, focusing intensely on the Durga image in front of me, trying to forget all the people around me.

 If I had been more familiar with that set-up, it would have probably been ok. Here, really unprepared that I was, I felt so nervous dancing in front of all of them. But to be honest, it was nice after a while.

 This year, during Durga puja, I will be in the middle of touring the East Coast of the United States with my father (Ravi Shankar) and his Festival of India tour. We are about halfway through it now and will probably be on the road during all the wonderful festivities out there in Calcutta.

 At this point of time, I am also very excited with my new album, Rise, which has been a tremendous process of growth for me, musically and personally. It?s different from any of my previous records and is also the first time I?ve made an album full of my own compositions.

 It was a challenging position I put myself into ? composing, arranging, editing and also producing an album that features over 40 musicians recorded in five different cities around the world (including Calcutta, with Tanmoy Bose and Bikram Ghosh).

 I always knew I wanted my new record to be something special. So, I didn?t just hash out at a moment?s notice. Also, I wasn?t given the time by management and family to do that.

 So, finally, I insisted on taking a sabbatical from my touring. At that time, though, I didn?t know that I would end up working in my off time. But I needed some time to be away from my regular life and take stock of things, as to what I wanted to do next, musically. 

 Happily I got involved with the making of Rise and there was no turning back after that.

 Although not intentionally planned, it is only my good fortune that my album has been released at such an auspicious time.

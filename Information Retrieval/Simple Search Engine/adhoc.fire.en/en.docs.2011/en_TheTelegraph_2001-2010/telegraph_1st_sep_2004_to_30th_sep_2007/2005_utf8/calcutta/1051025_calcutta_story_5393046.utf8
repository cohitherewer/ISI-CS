 Aishwarya Rai?s gold pieces had sparked a Paro trend. Vidya Balan?s traditional yet contemporary Lolita look had pushed up jadau sales. Now, Jackie Shroff?s jewellery could run Soha Ali Khan?s nose ring close this Dhanteras.

 With the Antarmahal posters bedazzling billboards, the heavy jewellery of the zamindar and his Chhotobou has already caught Calcutta?s eye. 

 And as the filmi connection to festive finery continues, it?s time ? yet again ? to revisit yesterday to dress up today.

 New tales of tradition may be the line taken by Tanishq this season, but it sums up the jewellery juggernaut for most pendant players. Be it Tanishq, couturier Raj Mahtani or home-grown Anjali Jewellers, revisiting Indian tradition is the theme for the Dhanteras dream.

 Yesterday?s colours, cuts, designs and patterns will all be on display this Diwali ? with inspiration drawn back from Paheli to Antarmahal.

 ?The Antarmahal jewellery is based on royal lineage. Along with Soha?s nakashi, Jackie?s kada and brooch will be trend-setting pieces,? feels Anargha Chowdhury of Anjali Jewellers, where Parineeta had sent jadau sales soaring by 35 per cent.

 Anargha picks ?intricate hair accessories? as the next big thing in bejewelled style statement.

 For C.K. Venkataraman, COO, Rani Mukerjee?s ornate pieces in Paheli had brought Tanishq closer to the ?fine jewellery buyer?, the ?higher-end consumer base?.

 At Tanishq, the spotlight this season is on regional designs, like the Devadasi of Tamil Nadu and the temple jewellery of Kerala, amalgamating the richness of the past with the requirement of the present.

 Think jewels, think opulence and so think Mughal, is the design story of Raj Mahtani. 

 ?The Mughals were known for their classic appeal, with the table-cut diamonds, uncut emeralds, or vibrant hues. Their designs can be converted into super-modern motifs with a few cosmetic changes. These pieces then turn into a perfect style statement ? to complement both a Cavalli gown and a colourful lehnga.?

 But how big will the Dhanteras dhamaka be this Sunday?

 ?Though Dhanteras was primarily a non-Bengali festival, the cosmopolitan nature of Calcutta has pulled in most Bengali buyers, too. Many people eagerly wait for Dhanteras packages and so retailers expect a rise of 15 to 20 per cent in sales during this period,? says Chandrakanta Roy Choudhury of M.P. Jewellers.

 But all that?s gold might not be glittering because of the rates and rains. ?With gold prices touching close to Rs 680 and expected to cross the 700-mark after Diwali, sales are bound to be hit,? rules Anargha of Anjali.

 With the weatherman warning of another wet patch, the Dhanteras shopping spirit could definitely be dampened, especially in the districts. ?But we?re still looking at a 20 per cent hike in overall sales,? said a spokesperson for P.C. Chandra.

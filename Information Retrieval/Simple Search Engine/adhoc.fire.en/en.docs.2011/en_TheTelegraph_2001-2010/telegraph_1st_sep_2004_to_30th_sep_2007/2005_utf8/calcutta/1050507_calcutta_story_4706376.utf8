 With barely a day to go for Mothers Day, put your thinking cap on to figure out ways to show her how much you care. A day may not be enough to pamper the most loved person in your life, but its an excuse nevertheless to make a special gesture. Do it your way, but the marketing blitz mirrors the trends. Here are a few options?

 Chocolate love

 nIf you want to seize the occasion to baby her, Kookie Jar has baked a special Mothers Day chocolate cake along with a cute Teddy Bear cake. 

 Pure chocolate hearts, chocolate flowers and a chocolate box filled with goodies are other items worth pampering your mom with. 

 Priced between Rs 60 and Rs 375, the goodies available at all Kookie Jar outlets (Rawdon Street, City Centre and Alipore) are bound to win the heart or at least the stomach of every mother. In case she is not convinced, each item has a message stating ?from the heart?. 

 Sparkle in her eye

 nDiamonds come in handy when you want to profess everlasting love to your mum as well. The Ishis line of special Mothers Day jewellery makes it easy if you want to take the mush beyond the perishable cakes and chocolates. 

 ?How many of us have appreciated our mother for falling in love with us even before she saw us or for crying every time we got hurt or staying awake for every exam we wrote. This Mothers Day, we give you the opportunity to communicate your feelings towards your mother which are beyond words,? is the mushy promotional message from Ishis marketing manager Manoj Subramaniam. 

 The range includes diamond-studded rings and pendants with the word MOM and MAA featured on them. 

 Priced at Rs 4,500 and above, these are available at all Ishis outlets (Forum, Westside and Senco). 

 Meal magic

 nCap off in style by treating your mom to a fabulous meal. If you are yet to pick up your mothers culinary skills, fall back on The Hyatt Regency in Salt Lake that has lined up special menus for the day at its restaurants. 

 While Italian speciality restaurant and bar La Cucina will lay out a lunch buffet with wine, Waterside Cafe has a special Continental buffet for lunch and dinner. 

 Other attractions apart from the grub are the red and white wines, instant family photographs, gifts for every mother and an invitation for a complimentary Sunday lunch at La Cucina. 

 Later in the week, a beauty workshop for 30 moms with Kaya Skin Clinic will follow.

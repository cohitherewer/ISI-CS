The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Safety spine of mall makeover

 - High-tech surveillance system add-on for greater customer comfort

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Face-recognition software and a tracking device to monitor movement in the mall. High-speed cameras to record and store away number-plates. Hand-held computers and a ramp-less system to ensure pit-stop efficiency in parking. A built-in, e-purse loyalty programme?

 After giving Calcutta its first true taste of the mall experience, Forum, which turns three next March, is reinventing itself as the ?country?s safest, most intelligent and customer-friendly? shopping address through a string of upgrade steps.

 The 200,000-sq-ft mall on Elgin Road is adding another 50,000 sq ft of retail space over three levels at an adjacent block, set to be ready by June 2007. The annexe, which can be accessed from the main wing, too, will house a supermarket, a bookstore and a clutch of ?high-profile international brands? across the basement, ground and first floors.

 The new wing will also hold the Rs 15-crore, fully-computerised multi-layered parking lot to add another 550 slots to the existing 200.

 The showpiece of the mall makeover, though, will be the high-tech surveillance system, to be up and running in 45 days. 

 ?We are creating an intelligent backbone that will integrate a host of elements, like minimising threat of a terrorist attack, ensuring greater customer comfort, better energy efficiency and, of course, a whole new range of options at an adjacent wing,? Forum managing director Rahul Saraf told Metro.

 While sophisticated cameras will click and control car crawl at all ingress and egress points through a real-time clock, another intelligent tracking tool will pick up human faces and follow them through the contours of the property.

 ?By installing this level of automation, we can ensure a far greater level of security, which translates into a higher degree of customer comfort,? says Saraf. The face-tracking system will be matched against the mall management?s database of suspects? gallery, augmented by mugshots obtained from the police.

 Saraf, concurrently fine-tuning final plans for the giant Forum II, set to come up near Science City, is keen to fast-track some of the innovations lined up for his GeNext mall to the first-generation property.

 For instance, the food-court debit card will be upgraded to an e-purse model, over a crore will be spent to ensure a ?20 per cent reduction? in power bills and a 24x7 service corridor created for FMCG products that can be delivered only during daytime.

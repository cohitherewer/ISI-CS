The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Pak debut at cable show

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Team India?s Pakistan trip is still a month away, but a team from Pakistan is visiting Sourav Ganguly?s city as soon as next week.

 A delegation from Karachi-based Pakistan Electronics Media Association is the highlight of this year?s Cable TV Show, the annual cable amp; satellite-related exhibition, which starts on December 20 at Netaji Indoor Stadium.

 ?Relations between the two countries have improved and we are trying to take that forward by inviting the group from Karachi,? said Pawan Jajodia of the Cable TV Equipment Traders amp; Manufacturers Association (CTMA).

 The visitors would not only get a glimpse of how the cable and satellite trade functions here, but also ?explore business opportunities?, Jajodia said. The five-member team, headed by chairman Ibrahim Rana, is expected to reach Calcutta on December 19 and stay till the 22nd.

 CTMA had made a similar camaraderie call last year, inviting the Islamabad-based Cable Television Equipment Traders amp; Manufacturers Association. But last-minute visa problems played spoilsport. ?Those issues have been sorted out this time,? Jajodia said.

 Bangladesh, a regular at the exhibition, will be sending a 200-member delegation. Neighbouring states like Assam, Orissa, Bihar and Jharkhand will participate.

 A plea to the government for industry status and a special emphasis on direct-to-home are the other high points of the eighth edition of the Cable TV Show.

 ?We will make a formal request to the Centre to grant industry status to the cable and satellite industry, which is worth Rs 12,000 crore, nationally. We will also ask the state government to reduce VAT from 12.5 to 4 per cent, like in the case of IT,? Jajodia added.

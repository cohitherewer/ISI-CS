The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 For better amp; safer drugs

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 From exchanging views on research to sharing knowledge about the side-effects of a drug to advising the government on research and development policies, the Indian Society for Clinical Research (ISCR) is the first organisation in the country to perform all these roles and more to boost research and development in the Indian drug industry.

 Launched in the city on Wednesday, ISCR is the only broad-based association which provides a platform to clinical research professionals to exchange information and ideas on a speciality area fast becoming a crucial industry in India.

 While striving to achieve the highest standards in quality and ethics, the society will spread awareness on clinical research and facilitate its growth in the city. 

 ?Despite attempts, there has not been enough research and development in the pharma industry. We need more effective quality-control and research before a drug is launched. ISCR?s main objective is to help manufacture better and safe medicines and make the country?s drug industry a top-notch one,? said Santanu Tripathi, medical superintendent and vice-principal, IPGMER-SSKM Hospital and a key member of ISCR in Calcutta. 

 Major pharma companies and experts from various medical fields have joined hands to form the organisation.

 The society will create a storehouse of information on clinical research, which will be available on the Net. It will also monitor legislative and regulatory developments and make representations to the government and agencies on behalf of the clinical research fraternity.

 Patients and patient-support groups will be able to interact with each other through the society, which will also provide newcomers in the drug manufacturing field with ?expert training?.

 ?The trend in clinical research is to provide patients with an early access to life-saving therapies. The government is playing its part in evolving a regulatory regime, which is also conducive to research of the highest level. ISCR will try to unify all stakeholders and evolve guidelines on clinical development,? said Shoibal Mukherjee, society president and director (medical affairs), Pfizer Limited.

 In the next few months, the society will launch a number of initiatives and focus on patients, investigators and pharma firms, all aimed at raising the standards and quality of clinical research in India.

 Gupta was a model till she made the nation rock to her bump-and-grind routine of Babuji zara dheere chalo. Then, she invaded homes as a television anchor. And now, she is all set to adorn the walls as a calendar girl.

 After starring in a swimwear calendar with half-a-dozen other models, Yana now has a date with 12 months of her own ? The Lee Supermodel Calendar.

 The gorgeous Russian beauty has been shot by six of India?s best known photographers in interesting locales for what is being touted as the first fashion calendar of the country. Interestingly, the calendar being put together by apparel brand Lee has only weekend dates marked on it. 

 ?The product that had emerged is more like a piece of art, it?s only incidentally a calendar,? says Darshan Mehta, president of Arvind Brands, Indian partner of the international brand.

 Speaking from Mumbai, Yana who has just completed her photo sessions with the likes of Prabuddha Dasgupta, Subi Samuel, Nisha Kutty, Tarun Khiwal, Tejal Patni and Suresh Natrajan, sounded excited with her latest assignment. ?It was very challenging shooting for this calendar,? says Yana, after a hectic two-week shooting schedule across the country. 

 The master lensmen were allowed to portray Yana in various moods, just the way they wanted to. ?It was a big task to be able to portray the look and mood that the photographer had in mind,? explains the lady who claims that in many of the frames she doesn?t even look like herself.

 And who was the pick of the photographers? ?Each of them is brilliant and since I was working with most of them for the first or second time, it took some time to understand their working styles, but I enjoyed it thoroughly.?

 The limited edition calendar is going to be distributed only to the country?s who?s who and the company?s ?super cool? or extreme high-end customers. ?We have also shot a video on the making of the calendar which will be shown as clips on television,? says Mehta. 

 A high-profile party in Mumbai on February 24 will mark the official launch of the calendar.

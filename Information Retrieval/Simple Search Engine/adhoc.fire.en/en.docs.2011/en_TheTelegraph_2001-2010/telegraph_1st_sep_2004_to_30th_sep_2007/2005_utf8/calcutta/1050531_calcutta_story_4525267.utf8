 Mainstream catalyst for disabled

 Disabled schoolchildren march for their rights. A Telegraph picture

 Sayani Palit, a student of Class IX, regularly tops her section at Adarsh Balika Shikshayatan. She is blind, but that has never come in her way. 

 Yet, at the start of her academic career her mother had a harrowing time convincing school authorities ? Sayani had to change schools twice ? that visual disability should not deprive her daughter of mainstream education.

 This, despite the existence of the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act since 1995. Section 39 of the Act makes it mandatory for schools aided and recognised by the government to reserve three per cent of their seats for the disabled. 

 Currently, of the 1,538 government primary schools in the city, only 249 are admitting disabled children. And of an estimated 35,000 disabled school-going children (between five and 14 years of age), a mere 643 are receiving mainstream education.

 The government has been far from zealous in protecting the rights of the disabled. The Act was passed in 1995, but it was only in 1998 that the government had issued a circular to all schools enforcing the legislation. In the absence of a proper enforcement authority, the response from the schools has not been encouraging.

 Things, however, have started looking up, with the establishment of Integrated Education for the Disabled Cell (IEDC) in 2003. The cell has come out with an action plan aimed at ?mainstreaming? disabled children. ?Besides preparing the children, we will launch a mass awareness campaign and have approached the Centre for funds. Part of it has been granted.?

 The action plan has already made an impact. Till 2003-04, only nine schools used to admit disabled students. But the figure shot up to 249 by 2004-05. 

 Elaborating on the modus operandi, an official said the cell tries to identify the special needs of the disabled children and provide them with proper aids, train the parents in dealing with their wards, sensitise peers and organise orientation courses for teachers.

 Sayani?s mother Chandrani, for instance, has attended a teachers? training course for the visually-impaired at Narendrapur. 

 ?Sayani learns only through the verbal medium. She sits on the front bench and her teacher takes care to explain all the board-work to her. Her classmates, too, are very cooperative,? said Chandrani.

 An official added: ?The action plan has been drawn up after conducting a thorough study on the needs of disabled students. Like Sayani?s mother, we want to create key resource persons in all families to assist the child. We will also launch an awareness drive at the village or ward level through posters, graffiti and performances by folk artistes. We are also sending guidance material to the parents.?

 Though the cell is struggling with only seven resource persons and one coordinator, it plans to involve all disabled children in its programme by the turn of the decade.

 Protest path to stop park handover

Md. Dastagir: Mayor Bikash Bhattacharya has decided to introduce an entry fee for the Citizens? Park. As leader of the Opposition, what stand will you take in this regard?

 A new board often overrides policies of the previous one. Hence, the mayor is merely following tradition. Introduction of an entry fee is not a very big issue: what really matters is the handing over of the park, a public asset of Rs 100 crore or more, to a private party to mint money in the name of realising maintenance cost. That is exactly what has happened in the case of Millennium Park. It was developed by investing Rs 5 crore of taxpayers? money on a sprawling plot along the eastern bank of the Hooghly. Then it was handed over to a private party. If the civic board tries to play the same trick in connivance with businessmen with vested interest, we will protest and organise a movement to stall such a move.

 Petty thieves steal iron rods and pipes kept by the roadside along the stretch 

below the partly-constructed Chowringhee flyover. The government is spending so 

much money in the construction. Why can?t it also engage guards for the safety 

of the construction material? The zone has also become accident-prone. Recently, 

while walking down Chowringhee, I saw a huge iron beam fall off the flyover and 

miss a pedestrian by a few inches. Such incidents reveal a lack of proper planning.

 All over the Jadavpur University campus, anti-pollution hoardings and boards 

declaring the area ?Plastic free? have been put up. Ironically, all these boards 

are made of plastic. After a few years, these boards might end up adding to the 

pollution in the area.

 Four-wheelers are sold with a temporary registration, valid for a specified 

period, within which the buyer has to get the vehicle registered. But is this 

rule not applicable to two-wheelers? New two-wheelers with blank registration 

plates are often seen on the streets of South 24-Parganas. This is a dangerous 

practice. Such two-wheelers cannot be traced in case of a mishap or if the vehicle 

is used for some unlawful activity. 

 Tapan Pal, Batanagar.

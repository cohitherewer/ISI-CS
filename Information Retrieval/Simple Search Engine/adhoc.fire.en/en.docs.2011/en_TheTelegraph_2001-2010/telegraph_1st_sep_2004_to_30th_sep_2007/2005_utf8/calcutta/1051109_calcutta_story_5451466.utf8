The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Garments park to outfit malls

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s government has decided to set up a garments complex to cash in on the demand unleashed by the shopping malls and standalone apparel stores in the city, which depend mainly on large-scale supplies of readymades from Mumbai and Gujarat.

 An initiative of the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC), the Rs 60-crore complex will come up on a 10-acre plot near Chingrihata, off EM Bypass, said Gopal Krishna, managing director of WBIDC.

 ?We have finished the preliminary work, the designing part is over,? said Gopal Krishna, adding: ?Construction of the region?s first such complex will start next month and it will be commissioned after a gap of two years.?

 As things now stand, there will be a cluster of five buildings, covering over six lakh sq ft built-up area, in the complex. Each building will have modules of different sizes from 1,000 sq ft to 5,000 sq ft, which will be allotted to different garment manufacturers and traders.

 This apart, there will be adequate open space and a common facility centre for those who will set up units there.

 Officials said the cost of the space will be fixed soon in such a way that small and medium manufacturers, too, can afford it.

 ?The complex will boast all modern amenities. Everything related to garment manufacture, including stitching, designing, finishing and distributing, will be done under one roof,?? Gopal Krishna said.

 Owing to the lack of an integrated complex, hundreds of garments manufacturers, like the ones at Mahestala, are working in an unorganised manner.

 The WBIDC has engaged I-Win, a joint-venture company with it and ICICI, as the consultant for the project. I-Win prepared the project report, along with its design, which has been okayed by the WBIDC.

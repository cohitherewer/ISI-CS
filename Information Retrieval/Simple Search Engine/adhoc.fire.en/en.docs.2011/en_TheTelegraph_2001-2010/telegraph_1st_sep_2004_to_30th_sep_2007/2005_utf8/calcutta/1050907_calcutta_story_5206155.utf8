The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Boss booked for smut mail

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on Tuesday arrested a senior officer of a central public sector undertaking at his south Calcutta home on charges of sending obscene emails and making lewd calls to a female subordinate.

 The officer has been booked under the Information Technology Act and remanded in judicial custody for three days.

 Sleuths said the officer was the immediate superior of the complainant. ?She had no idea when she lodged the complaint that the culprit was her boss,? said a sleuth.

 The woman had complained to the CID a few days ago that she had been getting obscene calls and emails daily for the past four months. 

 ?Another sudden development was that some people, whom she never knew, started visiting her house,? said Rajeev Kumar, deputy inspector-general of police (CID-operations).

 Nilu Sherpa Chakraborty, deputy superintendent of the women?s grievance cell of CID, which recorded the complaint, said: ?First, we examined her email account and went through the obscene mails. We immediately contacted the Internet service provider and ascertained the telephone number used to send the mails. Our investigation revealed that the computer from where the mails were sent was in the woman?s office.?

 Experts engaged by the CID identified the computer, placed on the officer?s table. ?When we challenged him, he claimed that several of his colleagues had access to his computer and denied any knowledge about the obscene mails,? Chakraborty added.

 The sleuths then seized four more computers from the office, including the one used by the woman, and made a thorough check of the mails. ?We stumbled upon another telephone number used for sending the mails and located the computer in the officer?s house. After that there was no room for doubt,? Chakraborty recalled.

 Elaborating on the modus operandi of the accused, she said the officer had first created an email ID by using the woman?s name and surname. ?He visited chat rooms on the Net, pretended to be the woman, gave her telephone number to other chatters and invited them to her house.?

 After a few days, he created another email account and started sending mails to the woman.

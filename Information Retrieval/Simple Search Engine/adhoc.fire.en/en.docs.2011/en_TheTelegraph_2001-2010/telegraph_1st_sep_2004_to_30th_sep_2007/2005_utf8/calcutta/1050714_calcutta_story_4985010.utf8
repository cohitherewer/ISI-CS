 Crystal clear combo

 2005-06 collection of Swarovski in Hong Kong

 Immaculate forms in sparkling whites capturing the changing hues of frosted ice, transforming snowflakes into an ocean of crystals ? welcome to the Arctic world of the new autumn-winter 2005-06 collection from global crystal major Swarovski.

 Titled In the Mood for Ice, the collection draws inspiration from the distant and barren landscapes of the polar region, captured in the many magical facets of crystal and the myriad shades in its reflection.

 Three different lines of jewellery, accessories and home d?cor are strung together with the same thread of thought ? the shapes and changing colours of the frozen landscapes.

 The collection, to hit the racks of Swarovski stores around the world from August 15, was launched in Asia on July 6 with a sparkling fashion show and party at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre.

 The couture line called Daniel Swarovski and a diffusion line titled Swarovski Fashion have been created by Rosemarie le Gallais, artistic director of Swarovski Jewellery, who has drawn on her childhood memories of the cold North and her passion for travel. The home d?cor collection has been shaped by the art director of Swarovski Home Line, Darko Mladenovic.

 The way the pieces are constructed in In the Mood for Ice is divine architecture to me. The placement of the crystals has a rhythmic resonance of music in motion. The collection reminds me of Pink Floyds The dark side of the moon, said Markus Langes-Swarovski, a member of the executive board of the company and great-great-grandson of founder Daniel Swarovski.

 Couture line

 The Daniel Swarovski line combines crystal with fur ? fox, mink and precious pelts ? that give warmth to the stones, mixing shiny, matte and satin effects. An endless array of bags start with Raspoutine (fox fur with a patchwork of silver leather on its shimmering flap) and Rebel (closed by a flap in raw cut crocodile skin with gold edgings).

 Totes in crocodile skin sprinkled with gold, studded with large sunset-coloured crystals, and shoppers in crocodile and black trimmed fur, closed by a crystallised clasp in the shape of teeth and clovers are the highlights. Clutch bags in polished python or satin are decorated with oval multicoloured crystals. The Igloo evening case inspired by the traditional Eskimo habitat in white crystal bricks is a show stealer.

 The jewellery includes necklaces, earrings, bracelets and rings with the same frosted feel. A long necklace tiled with white opal crystals; bracelets, earrings and neckpieces made from crystal Dorado stones in all shapes and sizes; clusters of aurora borealis pearls cut in the shape of spinning tops mixed with white matte crystal pearls are some of the standout pieces.

 The highlights of this line are the Rococo (a large frosted necklace with crystals of all sizes that cascade into shimmering stalactites with matching earrings and bracelets), Romeo (a ring with a large facetted milky white crystal caught in four claws and set with fine stones) and Rigolette (a bracelet and long pendant with doll figures set in black, blue and white).

 While working on the theme we started with the colour scheme and then the shapes. It was a free approach without much thought for technicalities. Thats how I like to create, said Rosemarie, the petite old lady who has created magic with crystals at Swarovski since 1989. 

 Diffusion dreams

 Adding a new facet to the Swarovski crystal kingdom, the diffusion line is an extension of the trendy Swarovski collection. It is based on the couture lines codes, in a more accessible price bracket. The winter diffusion collection follows the same theme as the couture line.

 The jewellery pieces give the impression of snowflakes falling on the neck, shoulders and hands. Ice Floe, Iceberg, Infinity and Igloo ? words that reflect the polar image ? make up this collection.

 The Impact bracelet and bag of intertwined and intermingling crystal beads; Icicle necklace and earrings with long rods that reflect the low rays of the sun alternating with massive Glacier crystals; Ice necklace that sparkles around the neck; Illulissat necklace with Glacier drops and a matching clutch bag; Innu, a long necklace with interlacing chains, their links imprisoning crystals, are some of the eye-catchers here.

 Other interesting accessories include the Iceland shoulder strap bag and Anchorage watch, set with polar bear tracks moving across the dials.

 Home haute

 Crystal as solid as ice with bright, sparkling blue-tinged reflections form the new home d?cor line, recreating an arctic ambience.

 Theres a great synergy between the home d?cor pieces, the jewellery and the fashion accessories. All three combine to create a sparkling ambience, smiles Darko, the young Yugoslavian designer who has been frequently awarded for his astounding creations.

 The striking symbols that define this line are the iceberg and the polar bear, known as Iliiac and Nanuc in Eskimo tongue. These huge pieces impose their majestic presence as symbols of the Arctic desert. A stunning polar bear in clear crystal has a twin bear in chalk-white crystal, a first from Swarovski.

 A succession of other Arctic images forms the rest of the collection. The Milik set consisting of two matte porcelain vases and a bowl with huge crystals is inspired by the surface of a snowy winter landscape. The Smilla sets comprising a window decoration and a mobile holder resemble fragile crystallised tree branches. The fragility is also the focus in a candle-holder Nilac, slender as a stalagmite and sparkling with crystal beads strung on invisible thread.

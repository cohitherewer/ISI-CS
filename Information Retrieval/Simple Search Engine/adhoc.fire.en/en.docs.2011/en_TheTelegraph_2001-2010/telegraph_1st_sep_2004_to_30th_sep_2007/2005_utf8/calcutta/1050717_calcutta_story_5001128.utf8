 Talking up a cine storm

 If he ever wanted to re-make a film, it would be Devi Chaudhurani. If she ever got a chance to play her favourite character, it would be Julia Jentsch?s in Truffaut?s masterpiece Jule et Jim. 

 Some candid moments and a free-flowing chat between film-maker Rituparno Ghosh and actress Konkona Sen Sharma marked the interaction organised by Ladies Study Group at Ocio on Friday. And the two, for a change, fired questions at each other, besides taking a few from the audience. Metro on Sunday picks the highlights of the high-profile adda.

 Konkona asks Rituparno

You make quite a few films a year unlike my mother 

(Aparna Sen) who makes one after a huge gap. What do you feel are the advantages 

and disadvantages?

 It needs six months of undivided directorial attention to bring out a film. I have done three films in two years which I think is possible. Once I finish writing the script, 70 per cent of the creative process is complete. This is the period when I focus on thinking, planning and chalking out the film both creatively and logistically. During the shooting, I try to be very relaxed. I am not flooded with creative ideas while on the sets.

Of the various aspects that a director has to look 

into while making a film, say editing and dubbing, which do you enjoy the most?

 Actually conceiving the film. Chokher Bali and Dahan had come to me in the form of a screenplay. But in the case of others, it was an idea or an image that I had to transform into a screenplay. It?s very stressful when you are structuring the film in your mind. 

 After writing a script, I narrate the story to many people. It is during these sessions that the story actually grows, as I go on embellishing it with each story-telling session. 

 Rituparno asks Konkona

You have worked with two fine actresses, Waheeda 

Rehman and Shabana Azmi, in 15, Park Avenue. How would you compare their 

acting styles and did you feel any generation gap in the performances?

 I hardly saw them as actors because I am very close to Shabana as a person and I hadn?t seen much of Waheedaji?s films as a grown-up. As for the generation gap, I don?t feel it exists in performance. It shouldn?t, and even if it does, one must not make it evident.

 Audience asks Rituparno

You have worked with both mother and daughter. 

How different are they as actors?

 Rinadi is a perfectionist. Konkona has her own way to get into the scheme of things.

What has been your most challenging task?

 Directing Kiron (Kher) in Bariwali. She was playing a suburban domesticated woman and she needed to speak Bengali. She also learnt how to cook and make chapatis.

What has been your strongest influence?

 My advertising background which had instilled communication skills in me and a lot of values which I will always treasure.

 Audience asks Konkona

Are you more comfortable working with someone like 

Rituparno or a director you don?t know at all?

 You have to be able to trust the director to do your work with sincerity. And you have to try and make yourself comfortable, otherwise there is no creative bonding with the director. 

Which has been your most challenging role?

 Playing a girl obsessed with an older man in Ek Je Achhe Konya. I didn?t like the character and had a lot of resistance to it. I felt if I did the role well then people would think I was like the girl I was playing. I felt like crying and made it a torture for myself.

You were in theatre before you joined films. What 

difference has theatre made to you?

 Theatre gives you a hold on your craft and there is more consistency of character than in films.

Multiplicity mantra

At a time when the big names in movie exhibition and distribution are pitching their multiplex tents in Calcutta, Priya Entertainment Group (PEG) is planning to strengthen its base in the districts. Having already turned the Geetanjali theatre in Santiniketan into a movie-watching hub, Priya wants to repeat the success with the Krishti theatre in Memari and then convert the Annapurna hall in Sonarpur into ?the first rural cineplex?.

 ?It is getting difficult to match the corporate funding that is going into the city?s cineplexes,? admits Arijit Dutta, director of PEG. ?So we want to concentrate wholly on the districts and try to position ourselves in every divisional centre there. We want to show the rural audiences what is it like to watch movies in an air-conditioned hall and hear Dolby digital soundtrack.?

 Apart from exhibition, PEG has taken up film distribution in a big way and wants to distribute 500 films in the next five years. ?The jump-off will be from October-November and we would try to do the superhuman task of distributing two titles a week,? reveals Dutta. ?As far as Hindi films go, we will work with only corporate production companies like UTV, Shringar Films and Planman Life. Also, ours is the only office, perhaps in the world, to distribute both Columbia Tristar and Paramount movies.?

 The next natural evolution for PEG is film production. ?My father had produced some Satyajit Ray films like Aranyer Din Ratri, Pratidwandi and Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne under the Piyali Films banner. We want to revive the banner and get into movie-production again. I am already in talks with other production houses, both national and international, for joint ventures. We are looking at Hinglish and Benglish projects which have a foreign viewership apart from the local target audience,? says the man running Priya and Globe cinemas.

 Another of PEG?s ambitious plans is to get into eco-tourism. ?There is so much to see here in West Bengal that if we showcase all the physical features properly we don?t need to go abroad. We have the snows, the rolling meadows, the riverine areas and the dry patches. I see no reason why even shooting teams would need to go outside Bengal if we can nurture our locations properly,? concludes the man with a passion for nature travel in Bengal.

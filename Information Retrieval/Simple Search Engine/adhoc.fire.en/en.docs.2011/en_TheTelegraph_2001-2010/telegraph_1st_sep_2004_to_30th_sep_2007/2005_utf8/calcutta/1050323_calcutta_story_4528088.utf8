The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 We Ask You Answer

 Sympathy ear after stress years

 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Today?s question: Should counselling for parents and students at school be made mandatory in the run-up to the Board exams? More responses will be published next week

Suvadip Goswami,

 Maheshtala

Counselling before exams will not only benefit students 

and their parents, but also the Board. It can obtain valuable feedback from the 

counsellors and accordingly improve the examination system.

Biman saha, 

 Lake Town

If counselling sessions are held for at least three-four 

months before the Board exams, then the anxiety and fear of the candidates will 

be allayed to a great extent. Counselling sessions will also help improve communication 

between teachers, students and their guardians. Such sessions should be made mandatory 

all over the country.

Prahlad Agarwala, 

 Majdia, Nadia

The idea is good, but I suspect that working parents 

would find it difficult to attend counselling sessions. Given the scenario, counselling 

of students and their parents should not be made mandatory. 

MD Ayub, 

 Bright Street

Board exams are the most important tests a person 

has to write in his/her life. All kinds of assistance should be provided to students 

to allow them do well in the Board exams. Counsellors can provide valuable tips 

to help parents handle their children better during exams. 

Mehjibin Yunus, 

 Bright Street

Counselling will benefit students and their parents. 

Such sessions will provide an opportunity for school authorities to pick the brains 

of psychologists, parents and even the students. In the process, all concerned 

would benefit, not only during exams, but through the rest of the year. Counsellors 

can play a vital role in fostering a healthy relationship among teachers, students 

and guardians.

Ahasan Jahir Molla,

 Maheshtala 

The competitiveness and importance of the Board exams 

have increased manifold in recent years. To help students do well in the exams 

and prevent untoward incidents, counselling sessions are a must.

Sandhya Banerjee,

 Salt Lake

The time has come to replace the ridiculous parent-teacher 

meetings with counselling sessions for parents and students. The present education 

system demands regular interfaces with psychologists.

Debyani Basu,

 Birati

Different expectations from examinations are a major 

source of conflict between students and their parents. Almost every parent wants 

his or her child to be the best, but not all students are capable of being the 

best. This mismatch often results in mental problems in both parties. Counsellors 

can help students and their parents understand each other better. Psychologists 

can also teach students how to handle pressure.

Jayanta Chakravarty,

 Purba Putiary

Leave alone counselling, even a discussion with professionals 

on how to approach examinations would increase the confidence levels of students 

immensely. Students appear for their first Board exams at a very young age and 

hence need expert guidance. But I do not think counselling should be made mandatory 

at the Higher Secondary level.

Diptimoy Ghosh, 

 Salt Lake

Mandatory counselling can have an adverse effect. 

Students might start questioning why they are being counselled for no reason and 

not approach the sessions with the right mindset. Counselling will perhaps be 

more beneficial for parents. In fact, it would be a good idea to ask parents whether 

their wards need counselling.

Naren Sen, 

 Santragachhi

Counselling is important to help students approach 

examinations with the right mindset and also to help them chose the right career. 

Parents can learn from the counsellors to be more realistic while evaluating their 

children. It is the duty of schools to introduce counselling sessions for students 

and their parents.

Subhankar Mukherjee,

 Burdwan

From a very young age, parents tend to pressure their 

children to excel academically without bothering to analyse whether they have 

the potential. The pressure peaks during Board exams, and students definitely 

need professional help to deal with it. Counsellors can ease the burden on the 

students by helping parents realise their mistake.

Debashis Saha,

 Anath Nath Deb Lane

Counselling of parents and students is very important 

in this age of cutthroat competition. Psychologists can open up channels of communication 

between students, parents and teachers.

Ujjal Bhattacharyya,

 Entally

Mandatory counselling of students and their parents 

before Board exams would prove beneficial in the long run. Good counselling can 

definitely boost the confidence levels of students and motivate them. Factors 

that hinder the development of a student can be identified through such sessions. 

Counsellors can also suggest the right career path for students.

D. Bhattacharyya, 

 Sonarpur

I do not think counselling of parents and students 

at school will be of any help in the run-up to the Board exams. Parents and students 

will remain helpless if teachers do not do their job.

Arunava Bose Chowdhury, 

 Barrackpore

Counselling can at best provide a psychological boost 

before the Board exams. If a child is given enough opportunity to enjoy himself/herself, 

then there would be no need for a boost. In case of an academic or personal problem, 

he/she can easily seek advice from teachers and parents.

Sukanta Pachal,

 Howrah 

Counselling of both parents and students is the only 

way to help them cope with the pressure of Board exams. But the counselling should 

be done by professionals. 

Prasit Sen,

 Hatiara 

Counselling is needed for students as well as their 

parents in the run-up to the Board exams. When it comes to handling of pressure, 

parents are often worse than their wards. Guardians are known to get so anxious 

that they cannot direct the examinees in the right direction. Counselling is the 

most scientific way of dealing with the problem.

Anil Kumar Sen,

 Ram Chandra Chatterjee Lane

The stress on academic excellence and career has had 

an adverse effect on children. Under the circumstances, it is only sensible to 

make counselling sessions mandatory in schools in the run-up to Board exams.

Prasanta Kumar GhosH,

Barasat

Counselling should not be made mandatory for students and their parents. Except 

a few overzealous parents, most guardians maintain a normal atmosphere at home. 

Mandatory counselling will complicate the exam process. 

Ananya Das,

 Salt Lake 

Counselling should be made mandatory for students 

as well as their parents. The guardians often add to the tension of students regarding 

exams. Counselling can help students to deal with exam phobia while parents can 

learn to keep a check on their expectations from their wards. 

Debashis Pathak,

 Sura Cross Lane

Given the number of students who appear for Board 

exams every year, it is impossible to arrange counselling for each and every one 

of them and his/her parents. Teachers can, however, be asked to identify students 

prone to exam phobia or psychological disorders, and make it mandatory for them 

to undergo counselling.

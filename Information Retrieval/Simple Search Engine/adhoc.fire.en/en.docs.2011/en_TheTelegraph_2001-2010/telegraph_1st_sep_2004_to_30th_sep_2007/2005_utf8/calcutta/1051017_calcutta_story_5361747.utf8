 Before the Citu bandh managed to throw a spanner in the works for the industry in the east, the weather gods had played spoilsport for a big information technology (IT) exhibition in March.

 ?We lost around Rs 80 lakh when Compass 2005 was washed away on the second day at the Maidan and we had to refund money to the exhibitors,? said V.K. Bhandari, president of Computer Association of Eastern India (Compass).

 But the exhibition is back at a safer venue and with bigger plans this time. The theme for the four-day event ? Advantage East ? that gets underway at Netaji Indoor Stadium on October 21, echoes the state government?s IT initiative.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is scheduled to inaugurate the exhibition in the presence of IT minister Manab Mukherjee.

 Around 90 exhibitors would be occupying 195 stalls to display their products and services. ?We would have multi-national companies as well as national and regional brands,? said Bhandari.

 Global biggies like AMD, Intel, Microsoft, Seagate and HCL, as well as home-grown PC brands Aamar and Isyn are expected to set up stalls.

 This would be the seventh edition of the exhibition. ?In some cases, we have not been able to meet the demands from companies and had to offer them less space than they requested,? admitted Bhandari.

 Unveiling of new products and special schemes by IT vendors are some of the highlights of Compass 2005, where representation is expected from neighbouring states like Orissa, Jharkhand and Bihar.

 Another high point is a set of awards, based on a survey by research agency IMRB. ?The survey is being conducted among members to determine best products and services. There would be categories like best OEM, most popular product and best distributor. This will help both the industry and the consumer,? felt Bhandari.

 The results will be declared on the concluding day of the exhibition. There would be awards for Compass participants as well, in categories such as best display and best value for money products.

 In March, the fair ? spread across 50,000 sq ft opposite the Victoria Memorial ? had to be cancelled on the second day, after squally weather brought the structures down.

 This time around, the organisers expect to do business (including enquiries and bookings) worth Rs 100 crore, compared to last year?s figure of around Rs 80 crore.

 Today I shall take you through 

 some unique, interesting and lesser-known facts about the 

 animal kingdom! So, here goes?

 The unique

 Polar bears are left-handed: 

 The Inupiaq (IN-yoo-pack) have lived with polar bears over 

 the past several thousand years in the icy wastelands on 

 the North Slope of Alaska. According to the Inupiaq elders, 

 polar bears are left-handed. We urbanised folk don?t get 

 many chances to find that out, but when you do, remember 

 to duck to his right and avoid his lethal left!

 No two zebras have stripes 

 that are exactly alike: Their stripes are as unique 

 to them as your fingerprints are to you. According to zoologists, 

 while zebra stripes make zebras indistinguishable to other 

 animals, these stripes actually help zebras recognise one 

 another and distinguish who?s who in a zebra herd. Every 

 zebra has a slightly different arrangement.

 Do dogs sweat? Dogs have 

 the ability to sweat, but in places that are a little different 

 from humans. Their skin and armpit areas don?t contain sweat 

 glands like ours do. Dogs only have sweat glands on the 

 pads of their feet. Therefore, the only way they have to 

 cool off is through panting and through their feet.

 Dolphins sleep with one eye 

 open: Dolphins do sleep, but not quite in the same way 

 that people do. They sleep with one half of the brain at 

 a time and with one eye closed. Dolphins rest this way on 

 and off throughout the day, switching which side of the 

 brain they shut down. 

 During these periods, everything 

 inside the dolphin slows down, and the mammal moves very 

 little.

 A giraffe can clean its ears 

 with its 21-inch tongue: It is commonly known that the 

 giraffe is the tallest animal in the world, sometimes reaching 

 a height in excess of 18 ft. Along with its long neck, the 

 giraffe has a very long tongue, more than a foot-and-a-half 

 long, with which it can clean its ears!

 Basenjis don?t bark: Basenjis 

 have been bred for thousands of years to be silent hunters, 

 and do not bark like regular dogs because their voice box 

 is narrower and more uniform in diameter than most dogs. 

 But Basenjis are not mute and express themselves by growling, 

 howling, whining and screaming.

 The unbelievable

 Ants don?t sleep.

 At the end of the Beatles? song 

 A Day in the Life, an ultrasonic whistle audible 

 only to dogs was recorded by Paul McCartney for his Shetland 

 sheepdog.

 Cats have more than 100 vocal 

 sounds, while dogs only have about 10.

 When a giraffe?s baby is born, 

 it falls from a height of six feet, normally without being 

 hurt.

 A woodpecker can peck 20 times 

 a second.

 An elephant can smell water three 

 miles away.

 The blue whale?s whistle is the 

 loudest noise made by an animal.

 Fishes talk to each other. Some 

 of them communicate by making noises in their throats by 

 rasping their teeth, others use their swim bladders to make 

 sounds.

 A rat can last longer without 

 water than a camel.

 A cheetah does not roar like a 

 lion, it purrs like a cat (meow).

 A flamingo can eat only when its 

 head is upside down.

 A snail can sleep for three years.

 Oysters can change from one gender 

 to another and back again depending on what is best for 

 mating.

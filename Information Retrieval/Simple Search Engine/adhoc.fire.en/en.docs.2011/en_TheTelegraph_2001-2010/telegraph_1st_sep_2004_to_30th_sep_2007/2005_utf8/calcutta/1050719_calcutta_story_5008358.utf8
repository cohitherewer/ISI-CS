 What We are Watching

 Maine Pyaar Kyun 

 Kiya

 Dr Sameer (Salman Khan), afraid 

 of committing long-term to his lady loves, falls for patient 

 Sonia (Katrina Kaif) who wants him to divorce stand-in wife 

 Naina (Sushmita Sen). Sameer is on red alert with Pyaare 

 (Sohail Khan), Sonia?s neighbour, also in the fray.

 A hotch-potch remix of his old comedies like Biwi No. 

 1 and Deewana Mastana, director David Dhawan 

 tries to cover his inane and oft-repeated situations with 

 bust lines and biceps, forcing belly laughter at best.

 Barely okay in parts, Salman looks straight out of his CBI 

 question-answer session in most of the reels ? just not 

 there. He needs a loud wake-up call (tring, tring...).

 Loud sounds soft when it comes to character actors like 

 Rajpal Yadav and Beena Kak. An in-film advertisement of 

 Saridon would have been more fitting than the Vikram Phadnis 

 showcase. 

 Katrina looks fresh out of the sea waters and watching her 

 move to Just chill is, as they say, totaaaal paisa 

 vasool.

 Rather than flexing his muscles and threatening to make 

 a keema out of his enemies in every other movie, 

 Sohail looks more at home playing the cheeky chhokra.

 First weekend watch: 

 95% at INOX (Forum), 90% at INOX (City Centre), 88% at 89 

 Cinemas (Swabhumi)

 Last word: Stay 

 back home and turn on the Salman-Ash tapes on the small 

 screen. It?s more entertaining and definitely has more of 

 a plot.

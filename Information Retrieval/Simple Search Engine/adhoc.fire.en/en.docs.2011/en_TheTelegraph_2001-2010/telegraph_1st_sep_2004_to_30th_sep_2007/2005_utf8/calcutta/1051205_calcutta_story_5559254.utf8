 Deaths under wheels 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Speeding wheels claimed two more lives in separate road accidents in the city on Sunday.

 The first mishap took place around 8.10 am on Rabindra Sarani. A Matador van, carrying milk cans, hit a 40-year-old man while he was crossing the street near Natunbazar, off Beadon Street. 

 Witnesses said the vehicle was moving at a high speed. Being a Sunday morning, the road was relatively free of traffic. However, the driver failed to apply the brakes even after spotting the man from a distance.

 ?The air was still misty and the man was crossing the road slowly, to avoid stepping on the tram tracks. Only a few shops on either side of the road had opened. The Matador hit the man, hurling him quite a distance away, and then sped off,? said the traffic constable who was on duty at the time in the area.

 Local people rushed the man, with serious injuries in the head and arms, to RG Kar Hospital. Doctors said the victim had suffered severe internal bleeding and later succumbed to his injuries.

 The other mishap occurred around 2.50 pm at the Gariahat Road (South)-Prince Anwar Shah Road intersection. A private bus on route 234 hit a woman in her late 40s. 

 Police suspect the woman was a beggar and was trying to cross the road to collect alms when she was hit. 

 She died later at MR Bangur Hospital.

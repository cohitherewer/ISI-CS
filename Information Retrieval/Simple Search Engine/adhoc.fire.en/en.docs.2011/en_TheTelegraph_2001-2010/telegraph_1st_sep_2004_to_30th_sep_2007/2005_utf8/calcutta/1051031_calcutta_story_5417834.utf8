 JU students will study in Japan

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Jadavpur University students will enjoy the opportunity of studying in Japan from next year.

 Students enrolling themselves in any of the three faculties ? engineering, science and arts ? of Jadavpur University will be offered an opportunity to visit Momoyama Gakuin University of Japan, where they will have to attend a full semester.

 After completing the entire learning process for six months in Japan, the students will return to Jadavpur, where they will be able to continue their next semester. Jadavpur University will finally award the degree to the students after they complete their courses. 

 ?We are probably the first university in the country to have developed this kind of international credit transfer system,? said Partha Pratim Biswas, a senior teacher and a member of the executive council of Jadavpur University. ?An agreement has already been signed between us and the Japanese university in this regard,? he added.

 The university is negotiating with the Centre for its clearance to run this programme.

 According to the agreement, students of the Japanese university, too, will visit Jadavpur University to study a part of their courses. 

 What is special about this joint programme is that the degrees will be awarded to the respective students by the universities concerned. Usually, students are awarded joint degrees in such academic programmes between two universities, an official said.

 ?Imparting education through this kind of an exchange programme will enable students of both countries to share their infrastructure and teaching facilities,? he added. In addition, such a system of studying one semester in a foreign institution will help the students get better exposure in the job market. 

 Students of both undergraduate and postgraduate levels will be able to avail of this opportunity. The university is negotiating with the Japanese university to finalise the subjects in which this joint programme will be offered.

 Jadavpur University students selected to visit the Japanese university will be paid a stipend of 80,000 Yen per month. They will also be permitted to take up part-time jobs in that country, enabling them to earn another 20,000 Yen a month. This will be arranged by the university.

 The Japanese students will be provided free accommodation, food and education and also a stipend at Jadavpur. The amount of the stipend is yet to be decided.

 The agreement provides for exchange of faculty members as well.

 Civic flora on sale

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The parks and gardens wing of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) will promote its nursery products for commercial purposes. 

 As a first step, the CMC is organising a 12-day ?Treefest? expo-cum-sale in Chaplin Park as a joint venture with a private organisation. Mayor Bikash Bhattacharya will inaugurate the event on August 24.

 Saplings of potted plants, flowering trees, ornamental creepers and flowers will be displayed. Its main draw will be dozens of varieties of orchids, bonsai and fruit-bearing trees grown in pots at the Tallah civic nursery. 

 According to mayoral council member (parks and gardens) Faiyaz Ahmed Khan, 45 stalls will be set up in Chaplin Park, opposite the CMC headquarters, and a rostrum will be erected to begin an awareness campaign on afforestation. 

 The pollution control board and Paschim Banga Vijyan Mancha are keen to take part in the exhibition. Experts from the agri-horticulture society and botanists from different colleges will also participate. Besides CMC stalls, other privately-run nurseries, manufacturers of sprinklers and gardening implements will participate.

 A private collaborator will give the CMC Rs 50,000 from its earning by letting out stalls to different parties. 

 Mullickghat Phool Bazar Parichalan Samity recently started a dialogue with the CMC?s parks and gardens wing for cultivation of flowers for export.

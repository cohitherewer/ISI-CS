The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Tribute tour amp; field trip

 - Political point blurred, PM visit covers pilgrim points

 A STAFF REPORTER

 ?We are simple Bengalis at heart. We can?t think of living elsewhere,? one of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh?s two sisters living in Calcutta had told Metro earlier this month. 

 On Tuesday, their brother will be reaching Calcutta on a two-day visit that could be well described as the rosogolla tour embracing Bengali icons and a pet passion.

 The political focus of Singh?s first visit to the city as Prime Minister is, at best, fuzzy. He is scheduled to address a Congress workers? meet at Rabindra Sarobar, to which even the organisers are not attaching much political significance.

 Singh?s please-all visit, spread over two days, will take him to three pilgrim points ? the ancestral homes of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and Swami Vivekananda, and the ground of Bengal?s enduring sporting battle, East Bengal vs Mohun Bagan.

 When Singh visits Netaji Bhavan on Tuesday, he will be responding to an invitation from former Trinamul Congress MP Krishna Bose, also chairperson of Netaji Bhavan. 

 Singh, accompanied by Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi, will visit the museum dedicated to Bengal?s hero.

 Next stop, Swami Vivekananda?s ancestral house on Simla Street. 

 ?He said he wanted to be at Swamiji?s ancestral house on his birthday and the trip was planned accordingly. He will tour the house and visit the library on the auspicious occasion,? said Swami Vishokananda of Ramakrishna Mission.

 The Prime Minister?s third major Bengali stopover is the soccer field. Singh will kick off the ninth edition of the National Football League at Salt Lake stadium on Wednesday afternoon. ?Football is a game of the masses here and since he would be present in the city, we decided to request him to inaugurate the tournament,? said Subrata Dutta, secretary, Indian Football Association.

 Also at Salt Lake stadium, the Prime Minister will fete one of Bengal?s favourite footballer sons, former Olympian P.K. Banerjee.

 The scholar Prime Minister, however, will have one slightly dubious distinction to bear on his trip: National Library, where he will inaugurate the CII Partnership Summit on Wednesday, will be rendered off-limits for readers from 9 am to 1 pm, due to security reasons. 

 Sudhendu Mandal, director of the library, said on Monday: ?Readers are free to use the library once the Prime Minister leaves the premises.?

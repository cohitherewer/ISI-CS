 The City Diary

 Police on Tuesday claimed that Piyush Saha and Bimal Chakraborty, whose bodies were found beside a Kasba canal on Monday, had been killed by a professional assassin. Senior officers of the district police have not ruled out the possibility of a triangular love affair leading to the murder. The duo?s involvement in real estate business, too, is being looked into. 

 The two were murdered in a way that would camouflage the motive. The genitals were cut off and damaged to send across a message. We have found a few clues,? said S.N. Gupta, superintendent of South 24-Parganas police.

 he bodies of Saha and Chakraborty were found early on Monday, hours after they had attended a birthday party at a friend?s house. On Tuesday, police grilled the host of the party, Dilip Das, and two others to find if Saha and Chakraborty had dropped any hint about a simmering discontent between them.

 pposition leaders kicked up a storm in the Assembly on Tuesday, alleging that the murders were yet another pointer to ?slack policing? in the city.

 ?If candidates in an election could be outsiders, what?s wrong in bringing in cadre from outside for electioneering?? This is Subhas Chakraborty?s logic in support of his statement, on the eve of the Salt Lake civic polls, that his party would mobilise non-resident workers to conduct the election process.

 Even half of my colleagues in the Cabinet do not belong to their constituencies,? the transport minister pointed out on Tuesday. 

 e also cited the example of the recent Rajya Sabha polls, in which the Left Front had fielded Sitaram Yechury and Brinda Karat, both outsiders, from the state. 

 The office of the joint labour commissioner summoned the management and staff union of Blue Fox on Tuesday to hear their points of view on the closure of the property. The restaurant on Park Street downed shutters a week ago after the staff stopped serving guests over a wage dispute. The labour court may summon both parties again next week.

 An unidentified group shot at an employee of Titagarh Steel Factory on Monday evening. Joydeb Das, 37, was walking to the factory when the group shot at him from an autorickshaw on Old Calcutta Road, in Titagarh. Das was taken to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital in a critical condition. Police suspect the incident was a fallout of Das?s alleged affair with a married woman from the locality.

 The park and garden wing of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation will distribute 5,000 saplings and shrubs on Wednesday, in the presence of mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya and Opposition leader Javed Ahmed Khan. 

 A gang raided the house of a DYFI supporter in Sodepur, Sajal Bhattacharya, on Monday night and assaulted him and his family members. The gang also destroyed a TV set, a motorcycle, the telephone and some furniture. Local residents caught one of the criminals and handed him to Ghola police station.

 Representatives of all political parties on Tuesday mourned the death of CPM leader and economist Biplab Dasgupta. They laid wreaths on the leader?s body at the CPM state headquarters on Alimuddin Street. 

 Dibyendu Roy Chowdhury, civic chief engineer (water supply), said on Tuesday that the leaks in the pipelines in mayor Bikash Bhattacharya?s ward had been plugged.

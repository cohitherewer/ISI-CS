The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Killing us softly...

 The Jazzy Jane of Junagad is no more. While there is more a scramble for her sea-facing Juhu flat than a rush to claim her body, Parveen Babi?s straight-faced swaying to Jawaani jaaneman continues to evoke memories of a lonely girl gone lost in big bad Bollywood.

 Parveen Babi never quite earned the respect of critics nor did she pick up any awards but her dance numbers punctuated many a potboiler and stayed on as the lasting images of those films. Here are some of her best numbers, which will refuse to fade even if her disturbing and contradictory personality does.

 Dhuen Ki Lakeer was her second film and that too an average one but one glance at Parveen Babi in Teri jheel si gehri aankhon mein and you knew that just like her best on-screen partner, she was one lambi race ki ghodi. 

 The Lata Mangeshkar song Aankhen milayenge, nazdeek aayenge in Bhanwar was very restrained and soulful, one in which Parveen Babi?s eyes did all the talking, and how!

 All three couples were featured in the Humko tumse ho gaya hai pyaar song in Amar Akbar Anthony but there were no two ways about who all the public paid to watch. With Amitabh Bachchan by her side, Parveen Babi was the chosen one, way above the Neetu Singhs and Shabana Azmis.

 It was a shocker to see Parveen Babi opposite Shashi Kapoor in a film also starring Amitabh Bachchan, but the Suhaag tragedy was more than made up by her careening act to the Asha Bhonsle number Main to beghar hoon.

 You can call it the showstopper act but the Shaan title track saw Parveen Babi at her graceful best in cleavage-showing shimmering gown. After the grand lip-sync to Pyaar karnewale pyaar karte hai shaan se, the following car sequence of Babi and Bachchan engaged in wordplay was a Ramesh Sippy special.

 The film was Khuddar, a film very few bother to remember. But there was one song which stood out for the words and, of course, the one who mouthed them. While it went Angrezi mein kehte hain ke I love you, everyone in Calcutta waited for her to swing to the Bengali portion Bangali mein kehte hain aami tomake bhalobashi...

 Namak Halal will always remain a special for more than one reason. The Paga ghungroo dance, Bachchan?s angrezi blabbering, the Daddu sequences... But all seem so thanda when you turn back to Jawaani jaaneman and Raat baki, baat baki. The musical coming together of Bappi Lahiri and Asha Bhonsle with Parveen Babi, first in glittering gold and then in body-hugging black, was paisa vasool for even the repeat crowd. The recent remix videos might be swarming with come hither, skimpily-clad wannabes, but when it comes to Shikari khud yahan shikar ho gaya, there can only be one hunterwali. One with a beautiful mind and body.

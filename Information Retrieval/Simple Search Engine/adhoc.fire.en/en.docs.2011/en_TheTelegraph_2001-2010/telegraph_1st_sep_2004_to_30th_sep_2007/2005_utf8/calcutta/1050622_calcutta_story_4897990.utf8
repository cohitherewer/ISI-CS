 The citys favourite tearoom Flurys is enhancing its spread for the calorie-conscious and strictly vegetarian. For the first time in the Park Street landmarks history, an assortment of eggless and sugar-free cakes and pastries have made their way on to the menu.

 The goodness of fresh fruit and the sinful delight of chocolate can both now be had without the guilt, whipped up by chef Shaun Kenworthy.

 People today are more conscious about what they eat. In order to appease the calorie-watcher as well as the no-egg vegetarian, weve cooked up this dessert feast of sorts, said a Flurys spokesperson.

 A few of the eggless creations include the Deep Chocolate Truffle and the Cappuccino Slice. Fruit lovers can choose between the Wild Berry Slice, with layers of cherry syrup, dark chocolate and vanilla sponge topped with fruits or the Pineapple and Mango Dream, in which vanilla sponge is seeped in pineapple juices and topped with mango glaze.

 For those more interested in a sugar-free diet, the Mango Fool (fresh mango pulp, beaten with fresh cream and lightened with whipped egg whites) or Orange and Ginger Mousse (concentrated orange juice and candied ginger folded into fresh cream and lightened with whipped egg whites) are a great bet.

 The price pinch is Rs 40 per slice and Rs 600 per kg for those interested in buying the whole cake.

 Sea savour

 The thought of Goan food brings to the mind a lazy lunch at a beachside shack. Goan Prawn Curry, fried sea fish, steamed rice, some salad and Balchao with a few local, laid-back hosts for company?

 Most likely, vegetables wont appear anywhere in that wishful fantasy. But a few myths about Goan cuisine are being broken at the ITC Sonar Bangla, serving up some uncommon Goan fare at the Eden Pavilion buffet till June 26.

 While Goan food is believed to mean fish and more fish ? with some pork thrown in for good measure ? the platter is much wider, influenced by Kashmiri pandits as well as the Portugese.

 Goan food has two distinct divisions. The more popular one is the food cooked in Christian homes, which is spicy and predominantly non-vegetarian. The other, which has emerged in recent times, is Saswat food, primarily vegetarian and cooked by the Hindu population of the region, explains chef Raju.

 The range of dishes on offer covers the entire taste scale from the bland Valchi Bhaji, thats long beans saut?ed in a little oil for the main course and Chicken Peri Peri for starters, which is made with red chilli paste and is very spicy, he adds.

 Munchies like Potato Chops and Prawn Papad Roll (fried papad rolls filled with shrimp) are typical Goan specialities on the menu that should be tried out for starters. Follow that up with the classic Mutton Vindaloo or Prawn Curry.

 Dont forget to try the Bibenca, Guava Cheese and Godche for dessert. The lunch of dinner spread comes for Rs 650 plus taxes.

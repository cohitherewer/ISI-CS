 Soumyas Creation, a lifestyle store at 57/9, Ballygunge Circular Road, is hosting a pre-Diwali showing of costume jewellery and home accessories till October 31. The exhibition houses works by store owner Sudatta Chakraborty as well as various NGOs.

 Choose from beaded, costume or traditional jewellery pieces. The semi-precious line of ornaments, available Rs 400 onwards, comprises trendy corded chokers with stones such as lapis lazuli, tanzanite, smoky topaz and uncut red tourmaline.

 Home accessories include candles, durries, ceramic and wrought iron pieces, framed pictures, wooden trays and more.

 The range of durries is woven and comes in five sizes. Interesting wrought iron hooks with ceramic tiles are also on show. 

 A vast range of candles by Silence ? an organisation for the physically challenged and hearing impaired ? offers floating candles in various shapes, some of them beautifully embellished with peepal leaves.

 so on show are bags made by deaf and mute school children as part of their vocational training activity under designer Suman Saraogi. 

 Joining in are Asha Niketan with their Ying Yang candles and Self Help Womens Handicraft Society home products and apparels.

 This exhibition is a venture to help underprivileged groups showcase their talent. I am trying to organise permanent counters for these groups at the store. Also, I will make the exhibition an annual affair, says Sudatta.

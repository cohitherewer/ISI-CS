 The best things for Mohun Bagan are happening off the pitch. As one of the most famous football addresses in the country struggles to regain its glory on the greens, a band of young Mohun Bagan supporters is touting technology as a turnaround totem for the 115-year-old club.

 From tying up with cellular service provider AirTel for live updates on match scores through SMS to creating website (mohunbaganclub.com), the organisation, Green and Maroon ? A Group of Mohun Bagan Supporters, is rolling out a host of initiatives.

 ?Matches are played all across the country these days and unless there is a live telecast, one cannot keep track of the scoreline. Two of our members have been giving manual SMS service on match days, but to make the process hassle-free, we have tied up with AirTel,? said Partha Pratim Roy, media secretary of the fledgling fan society, while announcing the ?first such initiative in the country?. 

 The trial run for the SMS service ? one has to type in ?mb score? from an AirTel connection and send it to 646 ? is over and it will be formally launched on March 15 during the club?s National Football League match against Fransa in Goa.

 Not just live score updates, the association, with the objective of boosting the morale of the team and building excitement around the Mohun Bagan brand, is planning a host of programmes from merchandising to player recruitment back-up.

 ?Our agenda also includes facilitating election in the club and involving former players in the team?s selection process,? added Roy. 

 Realising the potential benefits from such an endeavour, the club management has extended full cooperation to Green and Maroon? According to the club?s assistant secretary Balaram Chowdhury, the supporters? initiative is a ?welcome change?. 

 It all started with a small push by Trinanjan Sengupta, an 18-year-old supporter, who developed the club website last year. ?It was a huge hit and aroused interest beyond borders. Now, fans across the globe are logging in, sending their suggestions and urging us to expand our scope of activity,? said Roy.

 The virtual war is hotting up, with arch rival East Bengal boasting two websites ? one managed by the club and the other by fans. 

 Both enjoy ?a large number of hits? from the expatriate community. Plans are on to dovetail the two and initiate more activities.

 According to Subrata Dutta, honorary secretary, Indian Football Association (IFA), use of the latest technology and communication tools is a must to expand the game?s visibility and reach.

 ?It is good to see a section of supporters uniting to do something for Mohun Bagan. This is a welcome development and if it leads to improvement in the team?s performance, it will do a world of good to the game?s popularity,? felt Dutta, spearheading a host of technology moves at IFA.

 Amit Sen, director, United East Bengal Football Team Pvt Ltd from the UB Group, is bullish about the benefits of using latest technology to create excitement, but stressed the need for continuity. 

 ?Clubs must keep the commercial element in mind and maintain continuity with professional expertise,? he summed up.

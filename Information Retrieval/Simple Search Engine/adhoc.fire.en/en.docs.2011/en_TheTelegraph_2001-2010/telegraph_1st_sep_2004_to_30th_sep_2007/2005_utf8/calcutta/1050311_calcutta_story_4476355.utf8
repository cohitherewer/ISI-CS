 Scanner on truck charge

 Flooded with complaints from truckers? bodies, the state transport department has asked the Howrah district administration to investigate the alleged illegal activities of a few non-technical motor vehicle inspectors.

 Presently, there are six non-technical and two technical inspectors in the Howrah motor vehicles (HMV) department?s enforcement wing.

 ?The khaki-clad, non-technical inspectors roam around in cars fitted with sirens. Whenever they come across an overloaded vehicle, they coerce the driver to strike a deal with them,? alleged an official of the Trailers? Association, a truckers? body whose members have alleged of being harassed by the inspectors.

 ?The raids are conducted in groups. So, it is impossible to believe that only one person takes the entire money,? said a senior Howrah motor vehicles department official, when asked about a particular non-technical inspector whose name features prominently in the allegations.

 ?The district magistrate will submit a report on the matter to us,? transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury said. Dilip Kumar Chattopadhyay, additional district magistrate (general), said: ?The department has asked for a report on the activities of an enforcement inspector of HMV. However, it would have been better if the charges against him were specified.? 

 ?From now, our additional regional transport officers (ARTOs) will be on the enforcement team. They will apprise me on the day-to-day activities of the inspectors,? said HMV?s regional transport officer (RTO) Sukumar Dutta.

 An overloaded vehicle has to pay a fine of Rs 1,000 for every tonne above the permissible limit, in addition to Rs 2,000. Around Rs 44 lakh was collected from defaulters between April 2004 and January 2005, which, officials say, is far below expected.

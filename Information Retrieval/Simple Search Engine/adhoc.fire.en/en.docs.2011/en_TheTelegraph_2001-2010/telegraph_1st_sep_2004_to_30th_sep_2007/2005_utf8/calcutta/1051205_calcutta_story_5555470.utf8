 Jubilee time

 Dr Prasanta Banerji, the homoeopath, has completed 50 years in his service to mankind. This occasion was marked by a felicitation by the PBHR Foundation at GD Birla Sabhagar. The evening first witnessed two Manipuri dance performances. Dr Banerji was then honoured with a bouquet and a certificate. 

 Dr Banerji spelt out his goal: to prove the science of homoeopathy on a global stage. Youngsters have too many distractions these days, they should concentrate on working hard and honestly, he said.

 People from various walks of life showed their support for the doctors mission by attending the function. Seen at the event were film-maker Aparna Sen, actress Debasree Roy and businessman Jagmohan Dalmiya.

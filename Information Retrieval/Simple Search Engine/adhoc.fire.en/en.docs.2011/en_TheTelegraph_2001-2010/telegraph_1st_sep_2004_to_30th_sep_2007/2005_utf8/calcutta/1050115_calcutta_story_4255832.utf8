 Stage bloc flays cop forced entry 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The dramatic turn of events on the Academy of Fine Arts stage on Thursday evening spilled over on to Friday, with claims and counter-claims.

 A team of officers from Regent Park and Hastings police stations had stormed the Academy auditorium on Thursday evening in search of TV actor Rudranil Ghosh.

 The cast member of the play Phataru being staged, accused of cheating and rape, was not present on the spot.

 ?The police team acted in accordance with an order issued by the sub-divisional judicial magistrate?s court in Alipore,? said deputy superintendent of police (town) Sumanjit Roy.

 ?A non-bailable warrant was issued against Rudranil Ghosh and the team had gone to execute that. The theatre group is not above the judiciary,? added Roy.

 The actor is absconding, clarified the deputy superintendent of police.

 The court order followed a complaint lodged by Oindrilla Chakraborty. 

 In her statement to Regent Park police, Oindrilla alleged that Ghosh had promised to marry her during the two years they had lived together.

 Realising that Ghosh had no intention of keeping his word, Oindrilla had filed a police complaint, stating that she had been duped and raped by him.

 A section of the theatre community came together on Friday to condemn the cop action. The turnout was thinner than expected, but the points of protest were loud and clear.

 Led by Debesh Chatterjee, director of Phataru, cast members and other theatre artistes gathered in front of the Academy of Fine Arts on Friday evening.

 ?We protest the way the police barged on to the stage and into the greenroom even as the play was on. They pushed me when I asked them the reason behind the raid,? said play director Chatterjee. 

 ?We will submit a petition to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Saturday, asking him to look into the matter,? he added.

 Theatre artistes Bibhas Chakraborty and Debshankar Halder, and Nabarun Bhattacharya, on whose novel Phataru is based, also condemned police excesses.

 ?The act was a violation of the sanctity of the stage,? claimed Bibhas Chakraborty.

 With the Academy area agog with talk of the chief minister?s force overstepping the line, police are running an internal check.

 ?I have asked the additional commissioner of police to submit a report furnishing all the details on the incident within 24 hours,? elaborated Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (south division).

 According to him, officers of Regent Park police station had sought the help of Hastings thana, under whose jurisdiction the Academy falls.

 A team from Hastings police station had then teamed up with some Regent Park officers to conduct the raid.

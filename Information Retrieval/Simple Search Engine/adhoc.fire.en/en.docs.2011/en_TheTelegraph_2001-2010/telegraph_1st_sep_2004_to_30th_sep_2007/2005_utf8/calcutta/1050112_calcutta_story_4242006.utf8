The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Stones didn?t roll, Sting won?t sing

 - Poor perception, reluctant sponsors, rude red tape and inert enterprise combine to rob Calcutta of mega gigs

 SUBHRO SAHA

MISSED 

Mick Jagger

Bryan Adams

 The Palace Grounds, Bangalore, yes. Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, New Delhi, yes. Andheri Sports Complex, Mumbai, yes. Salt Lake Stadium, Calcutta? No way? This city, it seems, just doesn?t rock.

 The Rolling Stones, Deep Purple, Roger Waters, Bryan Adams, and now Sting. Big-ticket rock and pop acts continue to give Calcutta the miss, even as far-flung Shillong registers a micro-beep on the gig-stops radar.

 What is it that keeps the city, which boasts a huge listener base of classic rock, jazz and blues music out of the fret-board fray? The answer seems to be a fusion of poor perception, reluctant corporate sponsors, rude red-tapism and lack of enterprise.

 ?The public image of the city as a place where nothing works has stuck as a stigma. I?m sure icons like Sting would love to perform in Mother Teresa town, but the feedback filtering out to the West is not always accurate,? laments Ananda Lal, who teaches rock music in Jadavpur University.

 Abeer Chakravarty, who, along with Lal, was part of ?Cause Calcutta, the voluntary core group that tried to get the Stones rolling towards Calcutta, feels the city deserves a break. ?Yes, Jethro Tull might have a niche audience, but for mammoth acts like the Stones or Sting, Calcutta surely fits the bill. Besides having a huge captive audience, we can draw the entire Northeast crowd,? he argues.

SET 

TO MISS

Sting

Norah Jones

DNA Networks, the agency responsible for bringing 

most of the top acts to the country, remains cold to Calcutta. ?The locations 

for these concerts are chosen keeping in mind the artistes? schedules. For reasons 

of logistics and routing, we chose Delhi and Bangalore for Sting,? claims T. Venkat 

Vardhan, DNA managing director.

Logistics is just part of the whole problem. Funds, 

for one, invariably fall flat. ?Ray Charles was keen to perform in Calcutta, but 

the thought of raising Rs 50 lakh simply paralysed us. One of the sponsors we 

approached felt it was wiser to get Amitabh Bachchan down at one-third the cost,? 

recalls Ashok Banerjee of Congo Square, which organises the JazzFest in town.

 City-based musician Nondon Bagchi, who was also part of the last-ditch effort to steer the Mick Jagger-naut towards Calcutta, feels the city misses the beat often due to the lack of a concerted initiative. ?If DNA had a willing partner here, Calcutta wouldn?t have been left out of the loop for acts like Purple and Sting,? he observes.

 Omar Haider of Showhouse, which jammed with DNA for the Vengaboys gig in town, and is pitching for a Norah Jones act in Calcutta, puts the no-show blame on the administration, not the audience. The ?lack of clarity and coordination? in corridors of power is enough to throw planning for a grand gig off tune.

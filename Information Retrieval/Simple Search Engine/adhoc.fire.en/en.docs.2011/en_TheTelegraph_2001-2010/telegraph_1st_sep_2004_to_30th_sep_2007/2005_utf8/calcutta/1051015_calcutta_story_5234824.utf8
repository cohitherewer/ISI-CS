 Anticipatory butler services for anything personal ? from movie tickets to flowers, laundry to packing ? a beefed-up Italian and Chinese menu, a sharp focus on the internal customer and the highest food-safety standards certification?

 Theres a fresh buzz at Taj Bengal and R. Pashupathy, the new general manager at the Belvedere Road star address, is banking on the right internal systems and guest feedback to carry the thread forward. I have come to Calcutta with an open mind, not with any pre-conceived notion, says the GM.

 Pashupathy started his career with the Taj Coromandel, Chennai, and has been with the group for over three decades. As GM of Taj Malabar where he assumed charge in 1987, he played an active role in the formation of the joint-venture company Taj Kerala Hotels and Resorts Limited and served on the board of directors till 2004.

 For now, retention of manpower is high on his agenda. Theres no denying the fact that competition is growing and Calcutta, in the next three to four years, will be up there with any other metro. Attrition rate will automatically be jacked up across the service sector. Our primary focus is our own human resources, because it always translates into good care of the guests.

 The exercise is not merely people-centric, though, even as the groups investment in HR is driven by the Tata Business Excellence Model (TBEM). Its equally important to have the right systems in place and adopt a process-oriented approach to ensure continuity of service standards, says Pashupathy.

 Many of the changes the GM is ringing in are in the F amp;B segment. The Hub, the 24-hour Italian eatery, has been boosted by the arrival of Antonella Medda from Genoa, who promises to tickle the Calcutta taste bud with a wok full of surprises after conquering London, Italy and Vienna! Not just the usual fill of pastas and pizzas, expect truffles and Tuscan delights often cooked with an unconventional slant.

 Chinoiserie, the Chinese speciality restaurant, also boasts a new master chef in Lian Yun Lei from Nanjing, China, who has brought in with him his interactive dining experience.

 From finding out the guests preference points to taking the order and preparing the dish itself, he often does everything himself. This constant dialogue with the guest is something we are trying to inculcate across all our F amp;B outlets, since it helps in getting critical feedback we can use to shore up services, the GM offers.

 Pashupathy is quite excited about the personalised butler service the property is set to launch in two months time. The butler will be a one-point contact for the guest, trained to take care of personal needs and focus on minute details like suits to be pressed, transport to be organised, or any other chores...

 Taj Bengal is the first hotel in the city to be awarded the HACCP (hazard analysis of critical control points) system, the highest international grading for food safety standards. This has always been a thrust area, and the certificate means a lot to us. We were also first off the blocks in setting up an in-house microbiology lab to screen food and ingredients in 2000, adds Pashupathy.

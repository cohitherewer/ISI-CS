The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Carnival call and colour splash

 The Great TTIS Challenge kicked off on Thursday with a rhythm razzmatazz. Revellers took the cue and made the most of the zestful line-up of events on Day One of the biggest school carnival in the city. Young Metro catches some of the star guests joining in the fun with participants at Swabhumi.

 After inaugurating the Sona Chandi The Great TTIS Challenge at Swabhumi on Thursday morning, Bikram Ghosh took the stage for a jugalbandi 

 Soon he had the crowd of youngsters cheering every beat. Performance over, it was time for the young audience to go autograph-hunting 

 A little later, model-cum-painter Piu Sarkar and artist Shuvaprasanna took the judges rsquo; seats for the T-shirt painting competition

 With a warm, winter sun overhead and a comfortable lawn laid out for them, the contestants were engrossed in having fun with colours . Pictures by Pabitra Das

Mirror magic for fair fortune

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 According to Feng Shui rules, circular or oval 

mirrors help the energy move fast. As a result, one cannot stand in front of such 

a mirror for too long. Square mirrors, on the other hand, reflect earth energy, 

which is stationary. This helps a person looking into such a mirror concentrate 

on his or her appearance

Q: I am a follower of Feng Shui and would like to know the rules one should follow while building the threshold of the house. Also, please let me know whether mirrors have an influence on us, especially when placed in the dressing areas.

 Debashree Banerjee

The Solution: The 

threshold is very important as it helps contain the energy flowing into the house, 

which then circulates all around nurturing every corner with its life-giving qualities. 

Care should be taken to ensure it is well illuminated in the evening. Solid stone 

or marble thresholds are preferred to wooden ones. It is inauspicious to have 

a cracked or broken threshold. Earlier, people believed the threshold should not 

be crossed with negative thoughts in mind. In fact, people in the West wish well 

for their house while entering. They believe if they love the energy surrounding 

their house, it will love them back. Indians also believe one should never fight 

with neighbours while standing at the threshold as it creates bad vibrations. 

Coming to mirrors, circular or oval ones help 

the energy to move very fast. As a result you cannot stand in front of the mirror 

for long. Square-shaped mirrors, on the other hand, reflect earth energy which 

is stationary, and will help you concentrate and focus on your appearance when 

you are standing in front of it.

 Nature nurture

 Q: We have been living in a dingy and gloomy flat for the last five years. We had to buy it due to money constraints. There aren?t sufficient windows and I feel suffocated and depressed living here. Please suggest a solution that can give me some relief.

The Solution: There 

are many ways of bringing warmth and sunlight into your house through the use 

of colours that give a feeling of sunrise. These can be vibrant shades like yellow, 

orange and touches of glowing red in the accessories. Surrounding yourself with 

images that portray life can improve your state of being. These can be pictures 

of gardens with beautiful landscapes, blooming flowers, cascading waterfalls and 

flying birds that represent nature?s beauty. These positive pictures will significantly 

improve your mental well being. 

 You can also use a large mirror on a wall that can reflect a window on the opposite side of the room and create the feeling of openness. Another way of bringing nature into the house is by placing fresh healthy plants on window extensions. Highlight them with soothing lights so that in the evenings you can illuminate them and feel connected with nature.

 Health hazard

 Q: My DOB is 16.02.1984. Currently I am pursuing my BA Honours in history. I am doing well in my studies, but serious health problems are hindering my future plans. Would I be able to pursue academics and a good career in future? Please suggest some remedies for my health problems and also let me know about my career prospects in the next five years.

The Solution: According 

to your pillars of destiny, you are a weak metal person and your supporting element 

is earth. Excess of water and wood elements drain your energy, resulting in weak 

stomach, liver and lungs. Next year, your health woes will come to an end and 

you will also do well academically. The ruling fire and earth elements will come 

as saviours to support you. Keep away from cool shades of blue and take the support 

of strong earthy colours like beige, cream, yellow and brown. Place a picture 

of a mountain in the south-west of your room to give you strength and support.

Prayer pick

 Q: I am moving into a new house and would like to have a separate prayer room. I would like to know where the door of the temple should be located and in which direction the idols should face.

Sangeeta 

The Solution: Entrance 

to a temple should always be from the centre of a wall, as they are the abode 

for gods. This is in contrast to having side entrances to homes and rooms meant 

for human beings. 

 The images should always be placed against the eastern wall facing west. With such an arrangement in place, we face the east while worshipping and this is auspicious.

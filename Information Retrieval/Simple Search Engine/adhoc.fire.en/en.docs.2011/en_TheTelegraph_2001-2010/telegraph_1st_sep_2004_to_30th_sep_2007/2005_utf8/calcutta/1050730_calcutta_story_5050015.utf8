The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 In most of the private buses in the city, there is no protective covering on the window grille and hand rails. These iron bars get rusted during the monsoon and get corroded. Passengers often find their hands dirtied and clothes stained by the brownish-red rust that comes off the rods. Will the public vehicles department see to it that the grille and hand rails inside private buses are covered with some protective layer, either made of plastic or rexine, as done in the new state buses. The transport authorities should pay more attention to these small but important details in public transport, instead of changing the colour scheme on the outside of buses.

 The intersection of Park Circus connector, Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and Hindu burial ground is particularly dangerous and has witnessed several fatal accidents in the past. It has been noted that no traffic policeman is posted here when the traffic is at its peak, between 7 am and 10 pm. Such an arrangement is absolutely necessary to reduce road mishaps on the stretch. The residents of the area would appreciate if the traffic police commissioner arranges for a constable on the spot.

 The stretch of Lee Road, parallel to Elgin Road, has become increasingly hazardous with frequent traffic snarls. Especially, the street on which Forum shopping mall is located, the area near the premises of the Calcutta International School, and the stretch to the west of the Nizam Palace are accident-prone zones. The vehicles of the car pool for students of the school occupy a major portion of the road. The footpath is mostly encroached upon by kiosks selling junk food. Pedestrians are the worst sufferers as they are left with no space to walk on. The situation is particularly bad during school hours. A little further along the road a vat makes matters worse. The stench from the vat increases manifold after every shower. The local administration should take remedial steps for hazard-free movement of pedestrians on this stretch.

 Jyoti Baksi,

 Heysham Road. 

 Kareya Kadambagachi railway station was opened in 1961, in the Sealdah-Basirhat section. Once, the station had even served as the location for the shooting of Bengali films. However, over the years the station?s condition has deteriorated. The amenities for the passengers have been steadily dwindling. Portions of the platforms of the station have been taken up by numerous small shops. The passengers have no sheds to stand under and are forced to brave rain and sun. I request the railway authority to revamp the station. 

 Prahlad Agarwala,

 Majdia, Nadia.

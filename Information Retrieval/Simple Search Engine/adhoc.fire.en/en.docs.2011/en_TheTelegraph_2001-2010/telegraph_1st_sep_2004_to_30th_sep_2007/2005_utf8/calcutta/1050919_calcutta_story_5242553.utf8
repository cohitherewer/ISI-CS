 If impracticality is the most common charge levelled against creations unfolding on the ramp, heres one fashion show that came out with flying colours on that count. Wearability was the keyword at a fashion show flaunting the new look from lifestyle chain Pantaloons.

 The present identity of the brand ? a fresh look, feel and attitude ? was showcased through a no-drama, no-frills catwalk at The Oberoi Grand on September 15. 

 Some of the countrys top models like Nina Manuel, Fleur Xavier, Viveka Babaji and Shayon Munshi shared the ramp with city catwalkers Sanjukta, Sreshtha, Ria, Devdutta, Tina, Pooja, Jessica, Neeraj and Amitabh among others. They paraded the fresh hues, trends and styles of the season.

 Instead of unveiling two collections a year, for spring-summer and autumn-winter, Pantaloons will launch a new line every 30 days. That way we will always offer our customers the latest international look and trends, said a spokesperson for the chain, explaining the idea behind the fresh focus.

 The show displayed a mix of westerns and contemporarised ethnics like trousers, shorts, capris, skirts of every length and style, tees, shirts, tops, jackets and salwar suits too. The look ranged from the hip to the girlie to the sporty.

 The ramp affair kicked off with a collection in aqua tints like blue, white and green and moved on to a vibrant line inspired by fresh floral hues. Printed floral motifs and shades of orange, green, magenta and red defined this look.

 The next one, drawn from the outdoors, came in earthy tones like browns and yellow. The action rocketed from the earth to the sky with a collection in fresh sky shades like a whole palette of blues and lilacs, with a liberal presence of denims. 

 The penultimate line came in pristine whites, while the grand finale provided mixed and matched glimpses of all the previous five collections.

 Show over, city band Dhwani took the stage to belt out some popular Hindi numbers. Their primary auidence: empty chairs. Most of the crowd had by then made a beeline for the food counters outside the ballroom.

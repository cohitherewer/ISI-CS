 Judge prescribes patch-up

 - Politician blamed for marriage rift; daughters hail court advice

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Justice came to the aid of a broken home on Monday. 

 A judge of Calcutta High Court directed an estranged couple, persuaded by a local leader to live separately, to patch-up for at least 15 days, and live together for the sake of their two daughters. 

 Last week, Justice Amit Talukdar had directed both Soumendra and Sabita Dutta to attend court, but without their minor daughter, as parental strife may affect her psychologically.

 Both Soumendra and Sabita appeared in the courtroom of Justice Talukdar with Sukanya, 22, their elder daughter, who lives with her mother, along with her 16-year-old sister Indira. 

 The judge decided to hear the case in-camera. 

 Swaswata Gopal Mukherjee, Soumendra? lawyer, told the court that his client was always ready to go back to his wife and daughters. 

 The lawyer told the court that a political leader of the Narkeldanga area was responsible for creating a rift between the couple.

 ?A local politician came to me and wanted to settle the matter against payment of Rs 14 lakh to the wife. He offered me Rs 2 lakh for taking the initiative to settle the issue,? the lawyer told the court.

 ?I ask both of you to think over the issue. You will find that both of you are equally responsible for this situation. As a result, your innocent children are suffering,? Justice Talukdar said.

 The judge added: ?I ask you to go home and stay together for at least 15 days and come to terms with each other. If there are problems, try to resolve them by discussing the issues between yourselves. After 15 days, you report to me.?

 Elder daughter Sukanya reacted to the court directive by hugging her father and requesting her mother to carry out the court order.

 After the hearing was over, the couple, along with Sukanya, left the courtroom. The younger daughter, Indira, who will appear in this year?s Higher Secondary examination, was waiting at home for them to return.

 After remaining married for 18 years, Sabita had lodged a case of cruelty and torture against Soumendra. 

 Local goons forced Soumendra to leave his rented flat in Beleghata, under Narkeldanga police station. Sabita demanded maintenance. The court had directed Soumendra to pay Rs 1,000 per month.

 Last week, when Sabita moved court in person, seeking a raise in the maintenance, the judge directed the couple to appear in court on Monday.

 It takes one to teach compassion

 Every time I visit Moitri Veterinary Clinic, I come back with several stories for my column. This time round, two stories stayed with me. The first, a heart-warming tale of two animal lovers who have made it their life?s mission to put an ailing dog back on his feet. And the second, a husband-wife-run NGO, dedicated to animal welfare.

 How I wish I had a teacher like Miss Uma Rao in school. She is the epitome of sensitivity and believes ?cats and dogs are only second to god?. A teacher in Carmel, every morning before going to school she feeds Kalu his breakfast and medicine wrapped in sandesh. Miss Rao has known Kalu for the past six years, as the local dog who would hang around the paan shop or the grocery store during the day and keep vigil at night.

 In April this year she found him lying on the tramlines, immobile from hip downwards. He had been hit. Raja, another animal lover, was called in and Kalu was taken to Moitri, where he was diagnosed with a broken hip joint. Since then, Kalu has been kept in a cage that has moved from place to place, currently stationed on the top floor of the new market complex in Lake Market. The cage has a soft bed made of cushions and a hotwater bag to prevent bed sores. Every afternoon and night, Raja feeds Kalu, exercises him, gives him physiotherapy and cleans him as well.

 Both Miss Rao and Raja refuse to take credit for Kalu?s steady recovery. Surprisingly, they don?t even think they are doing anything extraordinary because for them Kalu is family; a member they want to see walk again!

 My point: if you are a shopper at Lake Market or an animal lover, do your bit for Kalu?s recovery by feeding him, or call Raja to see how you can help. And for all you students at Carmel School, there is a lesson to be learnt from your teacher who treats human beings and animals with equal dignity and respect.

 Now to the husband-wife duo of Partho and Sritama Bhattacharjee running an NGO for animals called Mother?s Heart. It is housed on the ground floor of Partho?s uncle?s ancestral home in Behala. Initially, they started by picking up dogs and cats in scooters and taxis, for sterilisation. Now they have a Maruti van in which they do their rescue operations. Mother?s Heart houses about 30 dogs and 40 cats. Some dogs and cats are permanent residents here because their owners don?t want them anymore. Reasons cited by owners ? pet?s old age, loss of fur/coat.

 Mother?s Heart is run by genuine animal lovers with support from their area counsellor and other residents. Since they are relatively new (registered in June 2003), they are short-staffed and are in constant need of assistance. Students can volunteer with them for awareness drives and rallies. 

 My point: NGOs are meant for sterilisation, accident cases and handicapped stray animals who can?t be put back on the streets. When pet owners dump their pets on NGOs, the kennel space meant for strays is taken up by domestic pets, bringing the sterilisation programme to a standstill.

 P.S. To help Kalu, call Raja (24667663). Mother?s Heart: 9831476415/55261472.

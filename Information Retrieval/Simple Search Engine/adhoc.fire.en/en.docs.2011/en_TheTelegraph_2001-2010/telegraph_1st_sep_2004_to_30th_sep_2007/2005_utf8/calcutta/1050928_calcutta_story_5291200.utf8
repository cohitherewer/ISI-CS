Rattled by the growing problem of plastic waste management, the industry is trying to evolve a system to take care of indiscriminate dumping of plastic bags. 

 According to the proposal, every household in the 141 civic wards of Calcutta will be provided a huge plastic bag. It will be used to store smaller plastic bags. A local youth will purchase the bags from the households every week and sell them to recyclers. 

 The system has proved a success in Chetla and the mandarins want to replicate the model across the city.

 ?Charging a fine or banning the use of plastic bags in certain zones is not an answer to the problem. We have placed our proposal with state environment minister Manab Mukherjee and will also discuss the issue with the civic top brass,? said J.C. Agarwal, president of the Indian Plastic Federation.

 In Chetla, the federation members claimed, almost 1,200 households have been provided a plastic bag each, measuring 24 inch x 36 inch. Various plastic items are being stored in the bags. The bags are collected every week by a local youth, who also picks up plastic bags from parks and roadside bins. 

 The association members hoped that once more wards are made a part of the project, the collected plastic waste can be put to good use. According to sources, an attempt is on to use the waste to develop fuel. 

 Plastic waste management and a host of allied issues will be discussed when the captains of the industry meet in the city on Wednesday at Plastiscope ?05, a seminar on ?plastic fortunes?.

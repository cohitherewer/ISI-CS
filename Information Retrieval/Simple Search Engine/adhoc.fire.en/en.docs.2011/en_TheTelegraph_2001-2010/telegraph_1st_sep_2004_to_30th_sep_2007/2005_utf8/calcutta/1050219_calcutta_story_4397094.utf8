The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Confess cry in kidnap case

 - Mastermind claims he realised folly, seeks to make amends

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Gunjan Ghosh, prime accused in the Roma Jhawar abduction case, has voiced a desire to make a confessional statement before a magistrate. 

 With him are Guddu Yadav, alias Dinesh, Munna Sau and Ram Chandra Singh.

 The twist in the abduction tale came in the court of Bidhannagar sub-divisional judicial magistrate (SDJM) Alok Kumar Choudhury on Friday, just after Dilip Baidya finished making his confessional statement to judicial magistrate Bipasha Mondol.

 Roma Jhawar, 20, was kidnapped from near her Salt Lake home on February 4. She was leaving for college that morning when an armed gang intercepted her car and whisked her away. She returned home early the next morning, amidst conflicting claims of police rescue and ransom payment.

 All 11 accused in the case, including Gunjan?s parents Ashok Ghosh and Krishna Mitra, were produced before the court.

 The day?s proceedings, delayed by Baidya?s lengthy confessional statement, found the lawyers representing the defence appealing to the court to grant their clients bail. All have been remanded in judicial custody.

 The SDJM said Gunjan?s parents could not be granted bail, since he had told the court that he wanted to make a confessional statement.

 The judge observed that the statement could confirm or negate the theory of a nexus between Gunjan and his parents in the abduction.

 Outside the court lock-up, Gunjan?s wife Rumela stopped him to cry out: ?Are they torturing you in custody??

 ?Yes,? answered Gunjan, before telling her: ?Everyone commits mistakes, and I am only human. I have realised my folly, now I want to reform. Once I get out of prison, I will rectify all the mistakes, and we will live a normal life??

 There was no stopping Rumela. ?Everyone in my family has shunned us and my own parents are on the verge of disowning me?? she cried.

 On his way out of the courtroom, Gunjan told Metro: ?I have not killed Arvind. Pappu has killed him. I had no relations with Roma Jhawar.?

 Contradicting him a little distance away, wife Rumela said: ?I had heard about Roma, just like many other persons, from my husband. We are young and mix freely with others in our age-group.

 ?When Gunjan was arrested, the police also beat me,? she alleged, pointing at some bruises on her arm. ?The policemen had just barged into our house and pointed a revolver at my husband. I tried to shield him??

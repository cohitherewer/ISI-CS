 Concrete inches into conserved wetlands

 - SHUT ORDER ON THREE UNITS

 The high court may have banned concrete construction on the East Calcutta Wetlands, but that hasn?t stopped dozens of operators from setting up shop in this environmentally-critical zone.

 The West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB) has recently directed Mohan Udyog, Mohan Motors and Bothra Automotives ?to cease their activities? by end of May, on the basis of a public complaint.

 The units, the WBPCB order said, ?are operating in the East Calcutta Wetland areas which is totally prohibited as per the order of Hon?ble High Court, Calcutta?.

 The CESC and the local Tiljala police station have been requested to execute closure orders against the units on June 1 and send a compliance report to the board. ?The units did not disclose during the submission of consent applications that they are situated in the wetlands area,? senior WBPCB law officer Biswajit Mukherjee wrote in the order.

 The Institute of Wetland Management and Ecological Design, the nodal agency on wetlands in the state, confirmed the PCB finding that the units were in violation of the court order, which protected the region for its function as a waste-water recycling region, as well as other environmental considerations.

 While unit-owners were not available for comment, representatives of the companies claimed ?necessary permissions from the CMC? had been obtained.

 The problem, however, runs far deeper than the three businesses that have been hauled up. When Metro visited the sprawl off the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, at least another 14 units were spotted.

 Most were marble and granite traders, while a few car service centres were operational. They are located across a large stretch, starting just behind the Energy Education Park and extending till Basanti Road.

 All this construction has been allowed despite high-profile projects being shelved in the past, including those supported by the government, like Lake Lands IT village, Dimple Vincom Aquapark or mayor Subrata Mukherjee?s proposed Calcutta Gate.

 The 12,500-hectare wetlands was declared ?an international ecological site? by Wetlands International, which protects it under the Ramsar convention from any development. But the state government is yet to come up with a proper management plan, required of all Ramsar zones.

 ?All these illegal constructions and activities have come up in less than five years and despite my repeated complaints to various agencies, including the CMC, no action was taken before this WBPCB order,? alleges Javed Khan, member, mayor-in-council, who claims that ?75 per cent of the area belonged to the CMC?.

 Debasish Kumar, borough VII chairman, under which the area falls, said he has ?received the WBPCB order? and was looking into it.

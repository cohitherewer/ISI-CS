The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Govt pitches big with milk products

 A STAFF REPORTER

 In a bid to take on private competitors, the West Bengal Milk Federation has introduced lassi, kheer, peda, ghee and butter for the Calcutta market.

 Launched on Wednesday under the brand name Ben?s, a 200-ml lassi pouch is priced at Rs 6, a packet of two pedas Rs 6, a 100-g butter pack Rs 13, while a 100-g bottle of ghee is priced at Rs 24.

 That?s not all. ?We will soon introduce paneer and kaju barfi,? said an animal resources department official.

 The products, launched by sports minister Subhas Chakraborty and animal resources minister Anisur Rahman at Writers? Buildings, will be available at Mother Dairy counters, in addition to the 23 Surabhi counters across the city.

 Chakraborty offered space in government bus depots in and around the city for selling Ben?s items. ?We will also open counters at the Salt Lake stadium, Netaji Indoor Stadium, Siliguri stadium and Moulali Yuba Kendra,? he added.

 The products may also be made available on buses on long-distance routes, like the Calcutta-Siliguri one.

 With quality products coming with reasonable price tags, the federation is trying to cash in on the rapidly-expanding milk and milk products market. 

 ?We now want to market our products better, like the Gujarat Milk Federation. We?re also seeking bulk orders for products like lassi at major sports events in the city,? said Subesh Das, secretary, animal resources department.

 According to minister Rahman, milk unions in the state are facing stiff competition from big players like Amul, and are, therefore, trying to expand their market in the milk and milk products segment. 

 ?We want to set up a chhana factory and will soon make sandesh and other chhana-based sweets. We?re also planning to introduce flavoured milk,? the minister said.

 He urged the milk federation to emulate the distribution system of soft drink giants Coca Cola and Pepsi. ?Their products reach even the remotest village.? 

 Dairies in and around the city buy 450,000 litres of raw milk daily, and produce 900,000 litres of processed milk. However, it is in products like butter, ghee and mishti doi that the milk federation hopes to give rivals a run for their money.

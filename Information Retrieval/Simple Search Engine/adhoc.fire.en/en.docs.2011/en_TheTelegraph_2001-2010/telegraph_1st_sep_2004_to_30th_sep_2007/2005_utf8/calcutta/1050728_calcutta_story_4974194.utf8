The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

A few films to act in, many more to make

After Raghu Romeo, Rajat Kapoor is putting the finishing 

touches to Mixed Doubles, starring Konkona Sen Sharma and Koel Purie. He talks 

to Reshmi Sengupta about his first two films and everything in between

 Koel Purie with Konkona Sen Sharma in Mixed 

Doubles, and (above) with Rajat in the same filmRajat Kapoor 

Mixed Doubles is reportedly on wife-swapping. 

What is the focus of the film?

Mixed Doubles is essentially about marriage... 

I wouldn?t like to call it a film on wife-swapping. Konkona (Sen Sharma) and Ranvir 

(Shourie) play the main protagonists and it?s about their marriage. Wife-swapping 

is just one episode in the film. Koel Purie and myself play the other couple. 

I wanted to make a modern and urban film about Mumbai ? pick an upper-middle-class 

couple and look at their marriage. 

Can you explain your choice of actors?

We extensively auditioned for each and every role 

and finally selected Konkona, Koel and Ranvir. We also auditioned many actors 

for the character I am playing. Then I thought I would do it. 

How is Konkona in Mixed Doubles?

Phenomenal, as also the other two actors. I had seen 

Konkona in Mr amp; Mrs Iyer and Page 3. I liked her in Mr amp; 

Mrs Iyer. I didn?t like her in Page 3. 

Raghu Romeo fetched a lot of critical acclaim 

and travelled to several international film festivals, but didn?t succeed at the 

box-office. What do you think are the reasons?

I admit that Raghu Romeo was a flop but, it 

is not the only thing about the film. Lots of people have responded to Raghu 

Romeo. Some people have emailed me saying they have seen it a number of times. 

This film was meant for a different audience. It was funny and truthful and also 

a balance between real and fantasy. It appealed to city people mainly. A feature 

film will do very well at the box-office if you have Saif Ali Khan or Amitabh 

Bachchan in it. 

Mixed Doubles has a very different humour, 

but I think it goes a little further than Raghu Romeo.

What happened to your first feature film, Private 

Detective Two, made years ago?

It never got released. It was a small budget film 

and there were no multiplexes then. It, too, was about marriage and infidelity. 

But I made it more like a thriller. And in between making Raghu Romeo, 

I just tried to make whatever I could. I made a short film called Hypnothesis 

for FTII Pune which got an award. I also made a documentary called Tarana 

(on classical music) though I am not really a documentary kind of person. 

I like fiction and feature. 

Given a chance, would you like to make a blockbuster?

No, I don?t think so. I don?t understand what is meant 

by a blockbuster. For me, Gangs of New York is a blockbuster and I would 

like to do such a film. I definitely can?t make Bunty Aur Babli. I don?t 

believe in such films. But just a small budget does not make a film good. You 

might make a Page 3 and make lots of money, but that doesn?t make it a 

good film. A film must start with a passion not with an eye on making money. 

You became a film actor rather late in life?

I wasn?t trying to be an actor at all. It happened 

by chance. The only thing that happened by design in my life is film-making. I 

wanted to make films from the beginning and went to FTII Pune for that. 

So, how did Monsoon Wedding happen?

I think Naseer (Naseeruddin Shah) had suggested my 

name to Mira (Nair). He had seen some of my plays and commercials, too. 

Was the role (of an abusive uncle) challenging?

No, it was scary. Dil Chahta Hai was more difficult 

than this because one had nothing to do there. I did Kisna. Acting-wise, 

one or two films a year is fine with me. I have done a telefilm directed by Sourabh 

Shukla recently.

And you also balance theatre with acting and film-making. 

How do you manage?

Well, I have been doing theatre for the past 18-20 

years. We set up the theatre group Chingari in 1982-83 in Delhi. Some members 

later shifted to Mumbai, but we banded again and continued doing theatre. I act 

and direct for Chingari. Our C for Clown has been running for the past 

five years in Mumbai. We went to Bangalore, Hyderabad and everywhere except Calcutta, 

which is really bizarre.

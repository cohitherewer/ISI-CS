 Innovation, intricate work, geometric shapes and contrasting patterns are what designer duo Sudhir Nayak and Tapash Biswas of the label Stae has in store for you with their latest line of ethnic wear. Despite new ideas and concepts, comfort comes above all else. We also take proper care as per quality control, snappy clean cuts and sober and elegant styles, says Sudhir.

 Comprising saris and kurta sets, the collection is peppered with embroidery, geometric prints and a mix of heavy yet stylised embellishments ? mirror work, metallic objects and sequins. 

 Designed on light fabrics, usually georgette and chiffon, the feel is classy and flowy. The colour palette is a mix of pastels and bright hues with pink, stark red, turquoise, magenta and lime green. 

 The outfits are available by appointment at their studio at Lake Place. The prices are reasonable by designer standards. 

 Vibrant vibe

 The summer collection at M amp;S, the New Alipore boutique stocked with creations by Megha Dalmia, is vibrant and colourful. From waistline jackets and kurtas in cotton, chiffon and mulmul to a range of trendy skirts, ponchos and kaftans, the line is chic and summery. 

 Perfect for the young and the young-at-heart, Meghas creations pack in a whole lot of patchwork, sequins and embroidery. A dash of antique brought out through coins, as well as the use of mirror and gota is found in abundance. 

 Though fusion outfits have remained the forte of M amp;S since its inception two years ago, the designer has now forayed into bridal lehngas and saris. Megha uses different embellished panels in the same garment for her signature touch. Brocade, Benarasi and other silks have been used generously to add to the richness. 

 In keeping with the seasonal trend, the colour palette is bright. Pinks and oranges marry blues and violets in her creations to bring the festive mood of a wedding alive. 

 The lehngas are priced between Rs 5,000 and Rs 70,000. A range of accessories like jootis, batuas and artificial jewellery, to match the traditional outfits, are also on display.

 Tanjore tuck-in

 Tamarind, the southern speciality restaurant at 64 Sarat Bose Road, is hosting a Tanjore food festival along with an art exhibition. 

 Tanjore, situated some 300 km south of Chennai, is famous for its art. 

 A food festival of this kind is an endeavour to educate the people of Calcutta some more about South India. The southern part of the country is particularly famous for its food and art, hence the marriage, says Shafiul Ishaque, owner of the restaurant. 

 The non-vegetarian platter consists of Rasam (soup), Prawn Masala Curry, Chicken Curry, Kari Melagu Peratti (mutton pepper) and Meen Varuval (fried fish). 

 The vegetarian options include Palkatti Pattani Masala, Cabbage Poriyal and Thotta Kai Peratal (mixed vegetables). 

 Khus Khus ka Halwa and Payasam help end it all on a sweet note. 

 The veg and non-veg options cost Rs 195 and Rs 295 respectively. The festival is on till May 29.

 Hyderabad high

 A celebration of royal dining is what the Eden Pavilion at ITC Sonar Bangla has in store every evening till the end of the month. Labelled the Summer Cuisine of Hyderabad, delicacies from the city are being dished out under the guidance of culinary expert Kunwari Kulsum Begum. 

 Kulsum draws on her nawabi lineage while cooking for the festival. My family was very secretive about its khazana of recipes and wouldnt allow girls into the kitchen because they would pass the secrets on to their in-laws when they got married, shares Kulsum.

 After marriage, Kulsum went to Lucknow where she soon started missing her ghar ka khana. Her grandmother gave her 300 recipes which took Kulsum over six years to master. Each dish was season specific. 

 A choice of kebabs, like lamb-based Patthar Kebab and Chutney Kebab are ideal as starters, while Kairi Gosht, Murgh Khara Masala and Prawn Tamatar are other yummy non-vegetarian items. 

 For vegetarians there is Paneer Chutney, Moong Ki Meethi Dal, Aloo Hari Mirchi and more. 

 Desserts include delicacies like Sheer Qorma, Kharbooje Ka Kheer and Khobani ka Meetha. 

 Diners have to fork out Rs 650 for the meal.

 Skin shine

 One needs to take more care of the skin during the summer months to combat excess pollution, heat and dehydration. The need of the hour is a balanced beauty regimen to cleanse the fatigued and sunburnt skin. 

 On Thursday, Jooves, a herbal brand of cosmetics, launched a collection of its products at C3, the supermarket, at City Centre. 

 The range includes face wash, moisturising and suntan creams, facial packs and other skin treatment packages. 

 I have been using these products for a while and they really suit me, says beautician Koeli Sengupta who demonstrated the use of the products through a large number of facial massages she conducted at the launch. 

 Instant tan removal, under-eye treatment and gold facial to perk up ageing and pigmented skin are a few of the recommended treatments.

 The company offers a large selection of sunscreen lotions with varying degrees of sun protection for people with different lifestyles. These should be applied at least 15 minutes before stepping out in the sun or it might not be as useful, advises Koeli. 

 Priced at Rs 50 onwards, the products are available at C3.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 ?It?s difficult to face failure?

 From rustic lethargy to urban frenzy, from original creativity to inspired ideas, from Abhishek to Amitabh, director APOORVA LAKHIA has chartered a new course with Ek Ajnabee. The man on fire tells Pratim D. Gupta about his grown-up movie

 Amitabh Bachchan in Ek Ajnabee

 You had huge expectations from Mumbai Se Aaya Mera Dost. Were you upset it didn?t do well at the box-office?

 I was totally heartbroken. After Mumbai Se? I went through a process of finding myself ? what I want to do in life and what kind of a movie I want to make next. It gave me a different perspective to life. It is difficult to face failure. It made me a more humble and a stronger person.

 How did you come up with Ek Ajnabee?

 I wanted to set my second movie in a metro, make it modern and very fast-paced, totally opposite to Mumbai Se? There are no animals in the frame, not even a single matka. Then, like everyone else, I too wanted to work with the great Amitabh Bachchan. It was a big dream. Even my mommy wanted me to make my next film with Mr Bachchan. So I thought of Indianising Man on Fire. I went to him with the idea and only when he said yes, we started writing the script.

 Why did Amitabh agree to do the film?

 The thing I sold to him is that it is a stylised fast-paced film. My entire generation has grown up watching him bash up the bad guys. So I told him that I want to see you do action again. I think that?s what made him say yes.

 But why do you have to copy an English film?

 In life and in cinema, you will always be inspired by something. It?s all about the kind of story I want to tell. Since I am perceiving something, it will be told my way. And I have never tried to hide the fact that Ek Ajnabee is inspired from Man on Fire. From Day One, I have said that I am remaking the Denzel Washington movie. What?s the point in keeping it under wraps? People should know what kind of movie it is. There?s nothing to be ashamed about ? more than six directors wanted to remake Man on Fire.

 How have you Indianised the original?

 We have made Ek Ajnabee for the Indian public, here and abroad. We have focussed on the emotions. Indian cinema is about the underdog, it is about Karna. It?s about getting the woman or overpowering sin. That?s the Indian concept of film-making. 

 Why are you calling it Ek Ajanbee?

 Because it?s all about a stranger coming to town. It?s the first time that Amitabh Bachchan has come to Bangkok, in a film and in real life. The others too ? Arjun Rampal, Perizaad Zorabian, Vikram Chatwal ? went to Bangkok for the first time in their lives for the movie. I have been there 27 times (laughs). And Bangkok plays a big role in the movie. Everything happens on the streets, on location.

 Now that you have shot with Mr Bachchan, what was it like working with him?

 He gives you what you want. He brings that quality of professionalism to the plate. The best thing is that everyone pulls up their socks when he is around. And Mr Bachchan knows what he?s doing. There?s nothing that the man hasn?t done in his life. In Ek Ajnabee, he?s done action after a long time ? with guns, knives, hand-to-hand, everything? We have also given him a cool look to go with the stylish action. He has very few dialogues, but great ones. He blows up a car and says, ?Hamare yahaan isey kahete hain, Happy Diwali?.

Why did you cast someone like Arjun Rampal who hasn?t had a hit in Bollywood?

 Have I had a hit? He should be telling me, ?Who are you?? It?s a matter of fate, a matter of time. I have a lovely cast ? from Arjun to Vikram to Baby Rucha.

 Abhishek is such a good friend of yours. Weren?t you tempted to cast him again?

 Now, I will go to him once I have a hit under my belt.

 Are you anxious that you are clashing with a Yash Chopra release?

 Not really. Neal ?N? Nikki is an Archies kind of a film. We are slightly grown up. Ours is an emotional drama with action in it. I also believe there is enough space in our industry for 10 films to release at the same time.

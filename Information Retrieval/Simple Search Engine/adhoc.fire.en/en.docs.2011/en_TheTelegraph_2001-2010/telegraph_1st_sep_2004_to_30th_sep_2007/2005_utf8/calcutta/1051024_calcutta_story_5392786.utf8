 Mutual fund scamster made crore

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Suave and savvy, Brajesh Majumdar sweet-talked his clients into handing him cheques for putting in mutual funds. Invest he did, but in his own name. And he kept the profit on the maturity of the schemes.

 The detective department of Calcutta Police on Saturday night arrested Majumdar from a hotel in Gaya, Bihar, for masterminding the Rs 1 crore-plus scam.

 According to police, Majumdar, in his early 30s, claimed to be a sub-broker of a finance company dealing in mutual funds and shares of reputed companies. 

 ?We have arrested Majumdar on the basis of a complaint lodged by Jaideep Guha, an engineer of CESC,? said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner (I) of police, detective department.

 ?The con man had cheated Guha and his family of Rs 9 lakh. He had collected cheques from Guha and his family members, drawn in favour of reputed mutual funds. He even handed them fake certificates against the investments. Only when they approached the respective companies for redemption did they find there were no records of their investments,? said Singh.

 Majumdar was remanded in police custody when produced in Bankshal court.

 Apart from victims in Calcutta, a number of people in the districts have also fallen prey to Majumdar?s trickery and invested several lakhs. 

 Once he had the cheques from the clients, he used to fill up fresh forms of the mutual fund schemes in his name and deposit them along with the cheques. He would surrender the certificates before the maturity date and withdraw the entire money.

 ?Using the same strategy, Majumdar has duped a person in North 24-Parganas of over Rs 20 lakh. We suspect that the total amount Majumdar has amassed would be over a crore,? said an officer of the anti-cheating squad of the detective department.

 ?We knew that he had fled the city. Two days ago, we came to know that he had put up in a hotel in Gaya. Our team went and arrested him. We have recovered some valuable documents from his possession which will help us unearth more details about his criminal activities and accomplices,? said another officer.

 In the world of Bangla band music, it doesnt get bigger than this. Bhoomi and Chandrabindoo, the two most popular music groups in the city, are coming together for an all-Bengal band hunt contest on the small screen. 

 The two bands will not only judge the performances of the contesting musicians but also, for the first time, combine rhyme and rhythm to come up with the title track for the show titled Band Party.

 To be aired on ETV Bangla and produced by Black Magic Productions, Band Party will have auditions in different centres in West Bengal including Calcutta, Howrah, Siliguri, Bardhaman and Behrampore.

 We are looking at around 500 bands sending in their entries, says Debashish Sarkar, head of the television wing of Black Magic and director of the show. 

 From there, the judges ? Bhoomi and Chandrabindoo ? will pick the top 64 bands, who will go on air. Through more rounds of elimination, we will select the top band in the state, he explains.

 But the USP of the show remains the coming together of Bhoomi and Chandrabindoo, often dubbed the East Bengal and Mohun Bagan of Bangla band music. 

 Says Chandrabindoos Upal: We are aware of the huge expectations that the fans of both the bands have. We have to come up with something special, although we arent sure at this point of time how it will turn out. But I feel the song that we create together will have flavours of both the groups and that should come naturally? We dont have to put in an extra effort for that.

 For Bhoomi, too, the project is special. Fans have always pitted the two groups against each other, but in reality theres no enmity between us, says vocalist Surajit.

 In fact, we have always shared a very good rapport and thats the reason the project has been floated. Of course, if both Bhoomi and Chandrabindoo take the stage together somewhere, we would want people to say Bhoomi is better. Shekhane kono chharachhari nei.

 Director Sarkar was an FTII batchmate of Chandril, the wordsmith of Chandrabindoo, and thats how the partnership plot was hatched.

 Its a coup of sorts of getting the two biggest bands on the same stage, says Sarkar. But we also want to highlight the band hunt contest. We will try and make most of the talent pool we already have, thanks to shows like Rojgere Ginni, Pentathlon and Haun Maun Khaun. So we are expecting a chhotoder band, an all-girls band and even a housewives band.

 But making it to the top wont be that easy with hard task masters like the members of Bhoomi and Chandrabindoo around. 

 We will be looking at the music band in totality ? everything from presentation to originality to improvisation to talent, says Bhoomis Surajit. We are searching for an ideal band but thats hard to find. We want to find a band good enough to be groomed into one, he adds.

 While the pilot episode with the two bands has already been shot, the hunt will be thrown open only in August and the show will go on air some time in December or January. Meanwhile, the two bands cant wait to get jamming together.

 We have performed on the same stage before and it has always been such a pleasure, recalls Upal. 

 Im sure even the music that we create together will be something that well enjoy and our listeners will love.

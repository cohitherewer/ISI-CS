 Twirl the angel: HC

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court wants the bronze angel with a bugle, atop the Victoria Memorial Hall, to rotate once again. And from January 2006.

 During the hearing of a petition relating to the condition of the heritage monument, the division bench of Justice A.K. Ganguly and Justice S. Pal on Wednesday directed the Memorial authorities to take steps to ensure that the 3.5-tonne figure twirled again on its base.

 ?The authorities will have to start repair work by December 1 and complete it in six weeks,? the bench ruled.

 The order followed a report by Memorial curator C.R. Panda, stating that the figure had been static till 1985. Thereafter, it twirled on occasion, till it got jammed in early 1999.

 ?M. Bhattacharya, retired head of the department of mechanical engineering, Jadavpur University, was requested to find out the reasons for the jamming,? the report stated. 

 Bhattacharya was successful in ?revitalising the figure?, which moved for a few days before standing still again.

 Panda informed the bench that the figure ? of Gabriel, the angel of victory ? got stuck after lightning-induced current passed ?through the rolling elements, causing local spot welding?. 

 He pointed out that application of rhythmic torque on the axle, on which the angel is fixed, will make the welded spots shear away due to fatigue. But ?the process of fatigue-failure is time-consuming. In 1985, it took around six months?, the report stated.

 During the proceedings, the issue of the construction of a buffer zone around the Memorial was raised. 

 The bench observed that one of the two judges had paid a visit to Citizens? Park. ?It?s right that a large sum of money is required to maintain the garden. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation can consider charging entry fee from visitors,? the court said.

 The bench asked civic counsel Aloke Ghosh to sound out his client about the proposal and report its stand to the court.

 Petitioner Subhas Dutta drew the court?s attention to the slow pace of work at another park being constructed by the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC).

 ?We have noticed it. We are, hereby, asking the HRBC to complete the job immediately,? the bench ordered.

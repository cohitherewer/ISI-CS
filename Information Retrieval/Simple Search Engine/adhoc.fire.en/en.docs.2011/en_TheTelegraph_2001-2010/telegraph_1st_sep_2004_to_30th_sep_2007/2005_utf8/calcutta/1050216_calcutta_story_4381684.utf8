The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 ?Today, I am free to pick the roles I want?

of Morning Raga

 She had reached Bhutan before schedule to soak in the balmy breeze, drive down the picturesque Paro valley or just observe Aparna Sen in action behind the camera. When not busy with any of these, she would be lost in the new script she?s reading. 

 Reshmi Sengupta caught up with SHABANA AZMI in between the shooting for Aparna Sen?s 15, Park Avenue.

 You play a professor of physics and the older 

half-sister of a schizophrenic girl Meethi (Konkona Sen Sharma). What did you 

find so interesting about the role?

 Anjali, the character I play, is a person I completely identify with. She?s a divorcee and doesn?t have any kids. She is hard-pressed, does too many things at a time but is also very concerned about her younger half-sister. She is in charge of Meethi; more because her brother has gone his own way and her mother is too old to look after Meethi. 

 Anjali is contemporary, urban, intelligent and is constantly juggling roles. She can be bossy but there is a huge vulnerable side to her, too. She is very close to me. I, too, am a contemporary, urban person. And I am really very happy to have got this role. Very few films of mine have allowed me to play myself.

 You share a great rapport with Aparna and Konkona?

 Aparna is one of the finest directors in India and she is a very good writer as well. Last year I was working as an assistant director with Aparna in Gulel and I know how she operates. We have been close friends for a long time. We can actually pick up the threads of the last conversation even if we talk after a long time and that is very comforting. 

 Konkona was all of eight when I first met her. I think that was before Picnic, during the making of Sati. She was a little baby then. But I had told Aparna then that Konkona would be a very fine actress one day and I was the first to predict that! I admire Konkona for the kind of films she has done because that requires a lot of courage. She is very talented.

 What is your relationship vis-?-vis Rahul Bose 

in the film?

 My sister is in love with Rahul but I don?t approve of him. I think he is not capable of taking charge of a girl who will be on drugs for the rest of her life. I think he is too conventional to do that. 

 You know this film is about personal life, about relationships. It?s about the fragility of relationships. And ultimately, all of us are looking for something. It?s a quest for happiness, like 15, Park Avenue, which does not really exist in Calcutta. But it exists in Meethi?s world. 

Aparna prefers to hold rehearsals and workshops 

before starting a particular film. Do you need them?

 I always prefer rehearsals, at least four to seven days before going on the floors. I need that time to develop a bonding with the cast. If I play a family person I need to look like one as well. During the rehearsals, we do a lot of improvisations that remain in the background but enhance the on-screen chemistry. We have had rehearsals before shooting 15, Park Avenue, as well.

 Of late, you have worked on several women-oriented 

films with strong roles. Is there a steady trickle of such scripts?

 The script needs to touch me in some way. I need to say something through it. I think I am very lucky that I am getting roles of my age and I am really free today to pick only what I want. Earlier, it was pack-up time for actresses once they hit 30. Now so many films are being made on women of my age. For instance, all my films over the past few years like Godmother, Fire, Saaz, Tehzeeb or Morning Raga. And all these roles have come to me after I was 40. 

 I see it as a phenomenon trickling down with the women?s movement. We have travelled a long way. But you must have noticed a very odd thing. Working women are almost invisible in Indian cinema, despite the fact that most women in our country, urban or rural, are working. We need to bring more visibility to them.

 Your forthcoming English film Waterborne features 

you in a different light? 

 Waterborne is a Hollywood film about a terrorist threat to the water system in Los Angeles. I play a Sikh woman who owns a grocery store and is very racist. I don?t like my son going out with his American girlfriend. But post 9/11, I realise how important it is for us to get over such racist feelings and talk of reconciliation. I liked the script very much because it voiced an issue close to my heart. Most Indian English films being made today are based on identity crisis and I think there?s too much of it now. We need to move on.

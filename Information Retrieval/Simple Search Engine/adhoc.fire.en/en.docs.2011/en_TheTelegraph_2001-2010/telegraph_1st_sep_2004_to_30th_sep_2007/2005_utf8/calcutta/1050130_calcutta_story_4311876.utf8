The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Sold on the cell phone

All aspects of network services have acquired a consumer 

focus today, except one

Shiloo Chattopadhyay

Mobile 

phones have changed our lives in recent years. In its early days few owned it 

and fewer envied it. Mobile phones or cell phones then were cumbersome to carry, 

not too dependable and quite expensive to use. No one felt nice about spending 

double-digit sums per minute of talking. Worse still, you paid when you received 

a call as well.

The watershed was the decision to make incoming calls 

free. All the allegations about cell phones being a rich man?s toy evaporated 

overnight. Cell phones soon reached the current ubiquitous status.

The business of mobile phones is a tripartite affair. 

The consumer deals with the handset-makers (the Nokias and the Samsungs) and the 

service providers (the Hutches and the Airtels). Handsets and network services 

are interdependent businesses. Size of the market for mobile phones obviously 

rewards both these groups. Yet, in the early days they rarely joined hands to 

develop the market. Each spent considerable money on advertising but told stories 

that are quite independent of each other. More importantly, the messages were 

often irrelevant to the task of promoting a new habit ? using a mobile phone.

Remember the famous Ericsson mobile phone ad ? the 

elderly man sitting alone in a restaurant mistakes a young lady?s cell phone conversation 

as an invitation to him. He walks up to her; she switches off her phone which 

was so far hidden behind her lovely hair covering her ears. She looks up to him 

and says: ?One Black Coffee, please.? The embarrassment on his face is remembered 

even today.

This ad was selling the small size of the Ericsson 

phones. It is debatable whether the size of the phones was one of the prime deterrents 

to purchase at that point in a market like Calcutta. Indeed, here was a brilliant 

ad being used for the wrong cause. The service providers in the meanwhile were 

engaged in an even more curious media battle ? who has more number of subscribers? 

Each kept claiming the leadership as if that number is what will give non-owners 

confidence to go ahead and buy a cell phone. 

Today, however, the market is booming and cell phones 

are ringing everywhere. All the vital signs of this business are healthy. Indeed, 

marketing activities of cell phones ? SMS schemes, ring tones, cricket scores, 

music as a ring substitute ? have been nothing short of brilliant. Virtually all 

aspects of network services have acquired a consumer focus. Except one.

B.K. Soni with a net worth of Rs 234 crore uses the 

same service from Hutch or Airtel as the man who drives his Mercedes S class. 

Mr Soni gets no extra privilege from the mobile service provider .His phone does 

not have a special series number that immediately communicates his special status 

? a consumer with a deep pocket. His is not a limited-edition handset especially 

made by Nokia at the behest of Airtel for their very privileged customers. His 

calls are not routed through any electronic filter to help him avoid unwanted 

soliciting. A special subscription fee for all this would hardly be a bother for 

Mr Soni. It would indeed be a very small price for him to pay. Most likely he 

would welcome the opportunity to demonstrate that he is a class apart from the 

hoi polloi.

Segmentation at best of times is a strenuous marketing 

strategy. For Airtel and Hutch, whose cash counters are ringing so loudly today, 

the effort perhaps seems that much more unwarranted. Except that today seldom 

guarantees a tomorrow ? in life or in the marketplace.

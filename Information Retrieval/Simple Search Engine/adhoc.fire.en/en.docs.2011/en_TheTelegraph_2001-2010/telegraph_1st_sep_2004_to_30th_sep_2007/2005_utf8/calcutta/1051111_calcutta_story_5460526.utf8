 From darkness to light

 Presenting a fascinating world of vivid imagination peopled by lively faces and figures, be they animal or human, the paintings of Kishore Chatterjee are, to the discerning viewer, a sheer joy to behold. Their appeal to the aesthetically minded lies in their ability to emote expressions through their vibrant visual quality, with ingenuity, suppleness and grace. Besides capturing his unique forms with the full depth of their expressions, Chatterjee?s unmatched gift of style and technique allows him to delightfully blend all that is playful in his lines and strokes with what is visionary in his perception. In Darkness and Light, an exhibition of his paintings, he focuses his painterly vision on what he calls the ?two truths, two directions? of life. Representing life as an ?understanding of darkness? and a ?recognition of light?, he endeavours to strike a balance between the two, ultimately articulating Martin Luther King?s dictum that in death, our final moment of darkness, we really find light. Inauguration this evening at 6.30; inaugural songs by Manisha Murali Nair and Manoj Murali Nair.

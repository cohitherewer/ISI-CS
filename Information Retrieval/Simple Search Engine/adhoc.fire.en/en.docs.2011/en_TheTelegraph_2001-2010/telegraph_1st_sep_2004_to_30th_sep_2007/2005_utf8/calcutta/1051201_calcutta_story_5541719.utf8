 A fireplace to fuel fun and frolic

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 According to Feng Shui, fireplaces bring a lot of liveliness and cheer to a house. But since they are dominated by the fire element, one should be careful about their placement. The southern wall is considered to be the best option for setting up a fireplace, but it should not be reflected in a mirror on the opposite wall. The fire energy can be further boosted by displaying artefacts like oil lamps, candles, green vases and pebbles. A painting of a flying phoenix on the wall above also helps

Q: I have a fascination for fireplaces and though the Calcutta winter is not very severe, I want to build one in my home. Could you please guide me with its placement?

 Amba Sen

 The solution: Fireplaces bring a lot of liveliness and cheer to the house, but because of their dominating fire element they should be carefully placed. 

 The southern wall is considered to be the best option for setting up a fireplace, but care should be taken that it does not reflect in a mirror on the opposite wall. Mirrors should also not be placed on the southern wall above the fireplace as its water-like reflective quality would extinguish the prevailing fire energy here.

 Instead, boost its energy by displaying artefacts like an oil lamp or exotic candles in star-shaped candle holders or green tall vases with green pebbles and stones around on the shelf. A painting on the wall with a flying phoenix or cranes signifies attainments of great heights and honour. Caution should be taken that the fireplace is not built under or above the prayer room or where the bed is placed.

 Career call 

 Q: My son was born on 05.01.1978 at 10.24 am. I would like to know his element and kua number. At present he is eager to switch his job. Please advise whether this is the right time for him to do so and whether it will be worthwhile. Also, I want to know when he is likely to get married and whether he will be happy in his future life. 

 Rana Nag

 The solution: According to your sons pillars of destiny, he is a strong fire person and needs to be balanced with earth and metal elements, which are completely missing in his chart. The chart shows a productive change of job in 2007.

 Marriage is on the cards next year, but it is strongly advised to get the bride and grooms horoscopes checked before marriage commitments are made. This is essential to avoid bad relations later on, since the number of broken and unsuccessful marriages is increasing. 

 His animal sign is snake, kua number is five and his auspicious directions in order of preference are north-east, west, north-west and south-west.

 Gate guide

 Q: I am getting a new compound gate and a new main door designed for the house. Can I go for a main door that has two panels where one is larger than the other? I am also thinking of building a canopy above the main door to the house. Will this create a projection and spoil the shape of the house?

 J. Agarwal

 The solution: The compound gate should be a solid one as it gives us a sense of security. So, do not go for the design that sees through and through. The height should be such that it gives protection, but it should not be so high that it completely isolates the home from outside. This arrangement gives an impression of living in a prison. 

 It is best to have a rectangular gate, but you can also have an arch on the top. Never go in for a gate that has a dip in the centre, as it symbolises depression in life. 

 You can comfortably go for the main door with two panels, but ensure that the one that opens into the house should be the larger of the two. It should also open clockwise into the house when standing outside. 

 Projection in the form of a canopy above the main door will not spoil the shape of the house because only projections that are more than half of the length or width of the house leave the remaining sectors as cut. 

 In fact, having a canopy above the main door is considered extremely auspicious, as this acts as a shelter to the very threshold of the house.

 Success chart

 Q: My date of birth is 12.04.1990. I would like to know about my education prospects and whether I will be successful in life or not.

 Rituparna

 The solution: You have a brilliant chart and will do very well in your academics. The chart reveals that your educational pursuits will materialise from 2007 onwards and will continue till 2013. 

 Your weak fire self needs to be supported by tree (wood) energy. So, you can boost the Chi of your room by adding green in the form of a green soft board, table cloth, tapestry and fresh flowers. 

 East is linked with wood energy, so enhance it further by introducing a picture of sunrise on the eastern wall.

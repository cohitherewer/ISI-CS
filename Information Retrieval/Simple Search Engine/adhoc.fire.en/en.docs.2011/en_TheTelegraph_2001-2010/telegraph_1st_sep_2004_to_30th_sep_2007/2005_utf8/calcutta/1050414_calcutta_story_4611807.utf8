 Maim-and-beg bust yields baby girl

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Police on Tuesday busted a racket in which children were kidnapped and engaged to beg in street corners and on railway platforms, after their limbs were broken.

 The kingpin of the gang was arrested and a child rescued during the operation.

 The racket was unearthed after police started a probe into the kidnap of a girl from Belghoria. 

 One-and-a-half-year-old Sayesta went missing from her residence on April 2. 

 Her father, Mohammed Sorab, who runs a small tailoring shop in the area, informed police about the disappearance.

 ?He repeatedly visited the sub-divisional police officer of Belghoria and pleaded with him to rescue his daughter. Sorab even accused police of not taking interest in the case as he was poor. Sayesta?s recovery had become a prestige issue for us,? said Parveen Kumar, police superintendent of North 24-Parganas.

 A three-member police team was formed to rescue the child.

 After receiving a tip-off, the team had laid a trap at an illicit liquor den in Park Circus and arrested Mohammad Rafique.

 Investigations revealed that Rafique and his accomplices used to kidnap children, break their limbs and force them to beg on the streets. 

 ?Sorab doesn?t have much money. Hence, we realised that the motive behind Sayesta?s kidnapping was not ransom. Our sources told us that she had been abducted to be put in begging,? said Prasun Banerjee, sub-divisional police officer of Belghoria.

 The investigators were alerted about Rafique, a resident of the Park Circus area, who often visited Sayesta?s neighbour.

 Sorab later told police that Rafique had visited their neighbour the day his daughter had gone missing. 

 The manhunt began in earnest after police got hold of a photograph of Rafique.

 ?We knew that he operates from railway stations. So, we started our hunt from Sealdah station. One of the members of the investigating team spotted him begging three days ago with a girl in his lap. But he lost Rafique in the crowd and could not net him,? said a police officer.

 By interrogating Rafique, police have found out that he used to run a ?begging business? along with a few other youths. While he did the kidnapping, the others collected money from the children.

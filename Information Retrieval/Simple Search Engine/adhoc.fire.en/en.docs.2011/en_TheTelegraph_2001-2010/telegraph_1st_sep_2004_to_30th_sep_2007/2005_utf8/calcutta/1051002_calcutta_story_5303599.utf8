The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The other side of midnight

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 You must have heard this one before. There was this man who sold life insurance. He was not the well-dressed archetype of a salesman. His shirt was sweat-stained. His trouser was an inch or two short. His neckwear looked more like a thread than a tie.

 He arrived at the office of a senior marketing executive. A hesitant knock and a loud ?Come in? later, the salesman was face to face with his target. The host was surprised and inquired about the reason for the visit. A brief explanation followed. This was far from a fervent sales pitch. It was more a stuttering apology for his trespass. The marketing wizard was bewildered and amused. He had never experienced such poor salesmanship. He took pity on our man. For the next half an hour, he explained to his visitor how he should approach the task of selling life insurance.

 For every target, you must have a well-planned strategy, the marketing man suggested. That strategy should manifest itself not only in what you say but also in the way you dress, the time of the day you make the call, etc. The lesson was comprehensive. Our man was a good listener. Big chief was pleased with his new-found student. As a gesture of encouragement, he bought a policy, for a hefty sum. All papers were signed. The initial cheque was handed over.

 The insurance agent looked visibly overwhelmed. He thanked his target and his teacher profusely, shook his hands as if he was touching his feet. He then walked slowly to the door, turned back for the last time. The big boss repeated: do not forget what I told you, you must always have a strategy. The insurance agent replied in a trembling voice: Sir, for people like you this is usually my strategy!

 Personal selling has been an acknowledged marketing tool for many years. In the marketing world of today, however, it is a much less talked-about discipline. One major reason for this is that it is visibly dominated by the idioms of consumer goods. True, a corporation selling such goods has its sales team. But there is a bit of euphemism in that label. The task of a sales team in a soap and shampoo company demands more of distribution management skills than personal selling skills. Physical movement of stocks, collection of money from the distributors, providing them with POP support material or choosing hoarding sites in out-of-the-way locations ? these would be the main agenda of a salesperson. Human intervention is often not an imperative.

 Today?s world of marketing is limited by this FMCG construct. We forget that huge businesses are transacted elsewhere. When Boeing sells aircraft or Glaxo details prescription drugs or Thermax hawks its industrial ware, they too have consumers. They rely a lot on personal selling. It possibly is their most vital element.

 The man from Boeing is not just a salesman to its customers. He is the most animated advertising that Boeing could have ever produced. The ad has the unique ability to adapt his message in content and style to suit the idiosyncrasies of an individual customer. The Thermax salesman in turn is part of the product the customer buys. Often he is the man who will get the spares in time to run the machine. He is the man who will arrange technical support when there is breakdown.

 Those of us who wear designer suits and enjoy mid-day cocktails on the pretext of doing marketing often forget a simple truth in marketing ? there is that other side of midnight.

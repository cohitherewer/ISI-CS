 Television?s favourite family is back for its seventh hilarious season. Join comedian Ray Romano and his quirky family on Everybody Loves Raymond, which has bagged Emmy Awards for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series (Doris Roberts), Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series (Brad Garrett) and Outstanding Comedy Series.

 The trivia around the show is as funny as the show itself. According to Ray Romano, Patricia Heaton got the part of Debra because ?she was the only one willing to kiss him on the lips in the auditions?. Peter Boyle claims that he was aided in getting the part of Frank Barone by events prior to his audition in New York City ? he couldn?t find the location of the audition and was agitated and sarcastic when he finally showed up. 

 Everybody Loves Raymond, which premiered on October 3, will air on STAR World every Monday at 8.30 pm, Tuesdays at 3.30 am and 12 noon and Saturdays at 5.30 am.

 She has after-school activities and hobbies just like any other 11-year-old. But on top of studies and guitar lessons, Juniper Lee is responsible for maintaining the equilibrium between the world of magic and humanity. From comic book auteur, former The Real World cast member and creator/executive producer Judd Winick comes the latest Cartoon Network original series titled The Life amp; Times of Juniper Lee, an animated adventure-comedy packed with an array of characters from both the real and fantastical world. The new Cartoon Network series premiered on September 11, at 3 pm. The Life amp; Times of Juniper Lee will be available in English and Hindi. 

 Juniper Lee leads a pretty normal life but on top of the everyday pre-teen escapades, she is the Te Xuan Ze (The Protector), who must strike a balance between the real and magical world.

 Juniper?s behaviour hasn?t helped her earn many friends in high-school, but she has her grandmother, Ah-Mah, to guide her.

 Shilpa Shetty: Social call

 She may be kicking a**es aplenty in movies like Dus, but at heart Shilpa Shetty is a sensitive thinker, who?s never shied away from reaching out to a social call. Having spearheaded a film like Phir Milenge, Shilpa now has come forward for Haath Se Haath Milaa, the country?s largest AIDS awareness mass media campaign, organised by the BBC World Service Trust, in association with Prasar Bharti and NACO.

 To be telecast on DD1 and reaching out to over 58 million viewers, the show features Shilpa travelling to a village near Udipi in Karnataka, to meet Shanti Noronha, a 31-year-old mother of two who discovered she is HIV-positive five years back. Shilpa and Shanti join hands to bring a new level of awareness to the people of Padubelle village, through a dance competition and a screening of Phir Milenge.

 Now you know Shilpa can win over UP and Bihar with much more than her jhatkas.

 Ragas in soul-search

 Pandit Ajoy Chakraborty: Brainstorming ahead

 Are the pristine strains of raga sangeet on their way to extinction? Yes, feel several classical musicians and connoisseurs who are gathering for a two-day meet in the city to brainstorm on the way ahead.

 The Crossroads, an interactive seminar starting September 20, has been organised by ITC Sangeet Research Academy (SRA) to probe the various facets of Hindustani classical music and its present status, with a bunch of 18 panelists.

 ?In the past 40 years, we have lost most of our music stalwarts. With them, the quality of listeners has also fallen. And it?s also because today?s musicians are so impatient to impress their audiences. Our seminar will try and find a solution to this problem,? said SRA director Amit Mukherjee.

 The inaugural day starts off by looking back into the heydays of raga sangeet ? the first four decades of 20th century ? and the star vocalists and instrumentalists. The birth of conferences and the way it has affected the music will also be discussed. The speakers include Ashok Ranade, Buddhadev Das Gupta, Vijay Kichlu, Shruti Sadolikar and Ulhas Kashalkar.

 The second half of the day will dwell on the period 1940-1960, when a new economic condition and exposure to the West left its mark on classical music. ?Here, we will discuss the role of recording companies and the concept of marketability that came along with it,? said Mukherjee.

 Music in the past 35 years will be the focus of Day II. Experts will analyse the toll taken by globalisation and new channels of entertainment on this traditional performing art. Speakers include Arvind Parikh, Gajendra Narain Singh, Ashwini Bhide Deshpande, Ajoy Chakraborty and Bikram Ghosh.

 ?We will also elaborate on how the student profile has changed and how the lack of dedication and devotion has affected the quality of today?s music,? added Mukherjee. 

 An open forum has been lined up for the audience to share their thoughts with the panelists.

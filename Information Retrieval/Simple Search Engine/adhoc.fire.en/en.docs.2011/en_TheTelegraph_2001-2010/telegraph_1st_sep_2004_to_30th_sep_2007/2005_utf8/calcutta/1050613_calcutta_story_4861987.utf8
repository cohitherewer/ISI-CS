 Civic ire at illegal building boom

 - Convention against promoter raj in Rajarhat

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 After sanctioning 6,000 four-storeyed building plans over the past three years, the Rajarhat-Gopalpur municipal authorities have suddenly realised that they must stop promoters from taking over the area for constructing commercial and residential buildings. A dispute over a large plot of land that children in Rajarhat use as a playground has reportedly led to the realisation. The plot has been targeted by promoters.

 On Sunday, the CPM-led municipality, along with the local unit of Citu and the local citizen?s forum, organised a public convention against promoter raj and illegal constructions mushrooming in Rajarhat and adjoining areas.

 ?Some promoters and politicians have recently been trying to influence the functioning of the municipality and exerting pressure on us to turn a blind eye to their activities. Despite our earnest efforts, they are trying to grab a sports complex and an adjoining wetland, commonly known as dhapar math, in Baguiati,? said Tapas Chatterjee, chairman of the Rajarhat municipality. 

 The convention assumed added significance in view of the ensuing civic polls in the adjoining Salt Lake municipality. The show, the first of its kind, highlights political factionalism in the area. 

 Heavyweights like Rabin Mondal, former CPM legislator from Rajarhat, transport minister Subhas Chakraborty and CPM parliamentarian from Dum Dum Amitava Nandy run the show in Rajarhat.

 Local residents expressed scepticism about the timing of the convention. ?They should have done this earlier. There is hardly a ward among the 23 in the area where construction has not taken place flouting civic rules. The comrades put up posters during the elections, but are seen openly promoting buildings, violating all norms,? said Subhas Chatterjee, a lawyer.

 In addition to the 6,000 four-storeyed buildings that have been sanctioned by the municipality in the past three years, this year, nearly 1,800 building plans have been passed till date. 

 ?The promoters are taking over old buildings, demolishing them and constructing highrises. On an average, three dozen people occupy the space where four persons used to live earlier. As a result, sewerage problems have increased manifold. Drinking water scarcity is also plaguing the area,? complained another resident of the locality who attended the convention. 

 Amal Guha, former chairman of the municipality, confessed that during his tenure, a section of local political leaders had pressured him to sanction building plans. ?As I refused, I was removed from the post,? he alleged. 

 Police said the upward population graph in the area has become a problem. Three promoters were shot last year in the area. Many criminals have also been killed following disputes over supply of building material.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bus in hurry sparks ire of students

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Student action slammed the brakes on one reckless vehicle on Tuesday and looked poised to pursue a protest path till a stretch of APC Road became a safer place to be.

 Rajabazar Science College of Calcutta University came alive to a hit-and-run crisis around 10.30 am on Tuesday when the driver of a speeding private bus on route 230 left a passenger ? a final-year student of the chemical technology department ? bleeding on the road.

 The student, who is scheduled to take her M.Tech final examinations from Thursday, suffered injuries but was callously dumped at the bus stop. Her condition is stable, officials in the university said, refusing to identify her.

 As soon as news of the accident spread, a mob of students, teachers and college employees chased the vehicle, intercepted it and rounded up the driver and the conductor.

 The two were brought to the campus and the local Amherst Street police station alerted. Police later turned up and arrested the duo.

 Students and teachers also protested police failure in setting up a permanent posting near the college, ?one of the most accident-prone zones of the city?.

 A few years ago, a student of Victoria Girls? College had been run over at the same site. Two years ago, another girl student of Rajabazar Science College was seriously injured after a private car hit her.

 ?Tuesday?s accident could have been fatal. We are worried over the increasing tendency of buses to drive recklessly, despite at least five educational institutions being situated on this stretch of APC Road,? said Manab Kumar Sengupta, secretary of the science and technology faculty.

 Recounting the accident, university sources said the bus driver was speeding while trying to overtake another vehicle. 

 As it approached the Rajabazar Science College bus stop, the vehicle in a hurry screeched to a halt. 

 The student who was preparing to get off, was hurled forward and hit her head against a window.

 ?She was bleeding profusely, but instead of stopping to help her, the bus driver just dumped the girl in the middle of the road and sped off,? said a witness.

 Sengupta said the college authorities would meet deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Arun Sharma and appeal for all necessary measures to check rash driving on the dreaded stretch.

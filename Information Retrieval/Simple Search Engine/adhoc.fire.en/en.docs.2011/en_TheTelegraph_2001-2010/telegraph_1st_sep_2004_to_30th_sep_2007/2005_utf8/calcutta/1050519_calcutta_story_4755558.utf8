 Luscious lasagne is on the menu at The Hub, Taj Bengal, with wine on the side, at the ongoing lasagne and wine festival. Lasagne can be whipped up into various dishes. In its authentic form, it is foreign to many and our endeavour through this festival is to cook up a variety of this speciality item, says executive chef Surinder Singh. 

 Seafood-lovers can dig into the Lasagne Con Gamberone Nepoletano (sundried tomato pasta sheet cooked and layered with river prawns, capers, gherkin and fresh palati sauce) or Lasagne Marinara Con Bisque (saffron pasta sheet layered with bisque-flavoured seafood ragout). Those with a preference for poultry can try the Lasagne Con Poulet Griglia E Pesto (pasta sheet with chicken supreme served with pesto cream) or Lasagne Con Fagioli E Poulet Salumi (herb pasta with beans, chicken sausage and pommery cream sauce). 

 If red meat is your choice, dig into the Lasagne Al Ragu Bolognese (duram wheat pasta with lamb mince and tomato basil sauce) or Lasagne Con Ragu Filetto Di Manzo E Salsa Vino Roso (pasta sheet with tenderloin steak, baby onions and red wine).

 Seafood goes well with white wine, red meat co-ordinates perfectly with red wine, adds Singh. Each dish is priced from Rs 425 to Rs 475.

 Veggies can opt for the Lasagne Con Pomodoro E Vino Bianco A La Fagioli Pannocchia E Salsa Pomodoro (tomato and roast garlic flavoured pasta sheet with cheese beans, American corn and pine nut served with tomato sauce), Lasagne Carciofi Con Broccolo Salsa Pepperoni (whole wheat lasagne with lemon mustard-flavoured artichoke and broccoli confit) or Lasagne A La Valdostana (sundried tomato pasta with wine-flavoured shallots, green olives and capers with fontina cheese sauce). Cost: Rs 325. Theres a twist from chef Singh on the dessert front ? Crocchette Di Dattero Mandorla Con Maple Salsa (dates and almonds phyllo coil with maple syrup) and Lasagne Con Croccante Zucchero E Cioccolato Con Salsa Kahlua (meringue and chocolate lasagne with kahlua sauce). 

 Goan grub

 Planning a Goan getaway this summer? Well, there are Goan culinary delights on offer closer home at Masala Treat, 49/1 Gariahat Road, the sister concern of thematic restaurant Mirch Masala. Everyone wants to run off to Goa during the holiday season, so we thought wed recreate the food and ambience of the place within this restaurant, says restaurateur Joy Singhi. Till the end of May, chef Antony DCosta, flown in from the seaside resort, is cooking up specialities called my mothers secrets. 

 Special soups and mocktails are on offer. Sip the Goan Beauty (a concoction of pineapple juice and coconut cream), or try the seafood soup (a mixture of seafood and fish in a hot broth). 

 The choice for non-vegetarians is aplenty. Chicken Cafreal (Goan roast chicken in green masala), Chicken Xacuti (traditional chicken curry), Goan Fish Curry, Mutton Vindaloo, Crab in Goan Curry? yums the word! For vegetarians, the chef has options like the Mixed Vegetable with Coconut Milk and the Goan Mixed Vegetable. A meal for two would cost around Rs 300. 

 Dont miss the ambience ? anchors, wall hangings, candlelight and waiters dressed in Goan gear, complete with straw hats.

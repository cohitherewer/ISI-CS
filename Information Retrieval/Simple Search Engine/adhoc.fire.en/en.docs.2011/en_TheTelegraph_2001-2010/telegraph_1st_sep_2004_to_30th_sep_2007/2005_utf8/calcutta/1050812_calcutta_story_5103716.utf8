 Ministers bury hatchet over project 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee revealed on Thursday that if need be, he can sink his differences with land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah. 

 The complementary roles of the two were in evidence when Bhattacharjee, prompted by a recommendation from Mollah, effected a change in the construction plan of a commercial-cum-residential estate at Gol Park.

 The Rs 15-crore project is one of the largest public-private initiatives in the city.

 Officials said the chief minister on Thursday told them that the government circuit house, being built as part of the project, should be situated outside the main complex on grounds of VIP security.

 ?The chief minister wanted the circuit house to be a separate entity for administrative reasons, especially for the security of VIPs who will stay in it,? said an official associated with the proposed project on the Bedi Bhavan premises at 5, Southend Road. 

 ?Buddhababu suggested separation of the circuit house from the main complex and an independent entry and exit. The rest of the land might be used for commercial purposes in the proposed public-private partnership model,? he added.

 According to the officials, Mollah sought the chief minister?s intervention in the project a week ago, following objections by finance minister Asim Dasgupta.

 The finance minister wants the government to execute the project through one of its arms and had also found the idea of the circuit house in the main complex unacceptable. 

 ?I submitted the project to the chief minister for clearance, as the finance minister was not giving the go-ahead,? Mollah said. 

 ?The former chief secretary had submitted a note stating that the state government did not have enough funds for the project,? he pointed out.

 The chief secretary had advocated the public-private partnership model and accordingly, Mollah?s department had floated a tender inviting bids for the project. 

 The city-based Fort group was chosen to implement the project.

 The complex, to come up where the sprawling Bedi Bhavan once stood, will be one of the most spacious in south Calcutta.

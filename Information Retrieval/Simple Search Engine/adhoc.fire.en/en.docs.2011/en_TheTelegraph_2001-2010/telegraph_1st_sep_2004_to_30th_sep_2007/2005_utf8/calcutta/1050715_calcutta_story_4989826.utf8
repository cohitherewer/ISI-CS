 Birthday bites

 Till a year ago, many Calcuttans were largely unaware that there was a rich, extensive and delicious non-vegetarian food heritage in the south.

 Crispy dosas, fluffy idlis and the favourite sambar was about as far as the understanding of South Indian cuisine went.

 But the image has been going through a serious overhaul, and one of the main messengers of meatier matters has been Tamarind, a south Indian speciality restaurant, which opened its kitchen at 64 Sarat Bose Road a year ago. 

 Meen Varuval, Kari Melagu Peratti, Coorg Chicken? Here, the chefs thought to offer much beyond the regular Udipi fare dished out by most restaurants.

 Instead, the recipes brought together mouth watering meat, poultry and fish dishes from across the four states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala.

 ?People, not only in Calcutta but even in the rest of the country, were of the notion that South Indians survive solely on lentils and vegetables. Though this is not totally wrong, the repertoire of non-vegetarian preparations down south is just mind boggling. The biryanis and the curries prepared there are completely different from that of their northern counterparts,? explained Shafiul Ishaque, co-owner of Tamarind, at the first birthday celebrations of the eatery, on Thursday. 

 Though brimming with confidence, Tamarind offered this drastically different cuisine with some apprehension. ?It is sometimes very difficult to change the perception of the people. We were apprehensive about their reaction. So we decided to start on a very small scale and grow gradually,? added Shweta Ishaque, co-owner. 

 To begin with, there were around four dishes from each of the four states. Now, after a successful start, the menu includes over 80 dishes from the region.

 But the quantity has not affected the quality. ?To start with, we have a chef who is from the southern region of the country. The Muslim and Christian influence is quite evident in the food we offer. Most of the spices used in the kitchen are brought over directly from Tamil Nadu,? said Shweta. 

 Hyderabadi Biryani seems to have found favour with the Calcutta tastebud. Spicy Coorg Chicken and Chettinad food has also been well received by regulars.

 As a part of the first year celebrations, Tamarind is hosting a sumptuous 10-day buffet ending on July 24, which includes three non-vegetarian dishes, four vegetarian dishes and a sweet dish. The pocket pinch is Rs 250.

 LIFESTYLE ZONE 

 Way back in 1925, Satramdas Dhalamal, already an established brand in jewellery since 1880, set up shop on Park Street. The plush address has been catering to the cr?me de la cr?me of Calcutta ever since. Originally belonging to the Dhalamal group, the store is now owned by jewellery designer Raj Mahtani, who, after having spent years in Europe, came back to Calcutta a couple of years ago and took over the brand from his family.

 While the store houses the most stunning collection of precious stones that one would get to see under one roof in the city, the d?cor of the interiors is completely in sync with the Euro medieval Mughal mood of the jewellery.

 Heritage appeal

 The sprawling 3,800 sq-ft ground floor wears a look thats heritage and swank at the same time. The white marble flooring, the high ceiling and a 16th Century statue of Yashodhara that hits the eye as soon as one steps in lend a sense of history to the decor. 

 A black antique cabinet, a gift from the king of Thailand that houses some of the jewellery pieces, adds to the charm. As do some exquisite Turkish glass bottles in blue and gold that embellish nooks and corners.

 Paintings by renowned artists adorn the walls and lots of bronze artefacts thrown all over the place enhance the appeal. A small water feature in one corner is timeless touch.

 The other striking feature that creates heritage aura is a gallery of black and white photographs of the stores celebrated clients, most of them maharajas. These line the staircase that leads to the mezzanine floor. 

 I dug up these antique pictures from my grandfathers chest of drawers recently. Almost all of these are over 100 years old, says Mahtani.

 I treat jewellery as art and not a commercial venture. And so I have a melange of art forms decorating my store, all bound by the same thread of tradition just like the jewellery, explains the designer.

 Gem galore

 Precious stones set in gold form the mainstay of Mahtanis jewels. While some sleek diamond pieces also find space on the racks, the designers forte is big and chunky pieces. 

 I believe in big and striking jewellery that will occupy centre space and not just accessorise clothes, observes Mahtani.

 An abundance of real stones ? uncut diamonds, south sea pearls, aquamarines, rubies, emeralds, turquoise, blue, yellow and pink sapphires ? in fresh summer colours shape the bold designs.

 There are some pure gold ones as well. Most of these are in matte finish and mesh designs.

 My jewellery is very avant garde and can be worn anywhere in the world, with saris and just as well with gowns, feels Mahtani.

 Neckpieces, bracelets or bangles, earrings and rings make up a set, but each piece can be picked up as separates. 

 The simplest of the rings start at Rs 10,000, while a pair of earring ranges upwards of Rs 15,000. Complete sets start at around Rs 70,000, with the price tag shooting up to several lakhs.

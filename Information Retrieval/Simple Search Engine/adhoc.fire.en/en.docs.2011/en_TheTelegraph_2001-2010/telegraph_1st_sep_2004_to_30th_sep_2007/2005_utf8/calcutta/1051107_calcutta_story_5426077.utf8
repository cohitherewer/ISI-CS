 Little nothings, rich on fantasy

 Parents and teachers worldwide may be rejoicing in seeing kids glued to J.K. Rowling?s magic words. But is Harry Potter bringing children back to the book-reading fold?

 No way, feels Marie Desplechin. The French author, equally acclaimed for her works for adults and children, does not see a victory of the bibliophile in the success of either The Da Vinci Code or the Harry Potter series.

 ?Such a reader goes from one best-seller to another best-seller, at the most. He reads a book with the same mindset as cooking or swimming.? Nor does it arouse their interest in the subject. ?All they became interested in was the code, not the painter (Leonardo da Vinci).?

 Marie has built up her own loyal readership, though, among both age groups over the years. She started her writing career as a freelancer for newspapers while ?working and having children?. 

 At 34, her first book (for children) came out. She followed it up two years later with short stories for adults. With the publication tally standing at 20 for children and seven for adults, Marie feels she prefers writing for the former. ?You can be free with your imagination.?

 But it was the success of her light-humoured take on the little nothings of workaday life, Sans Moi, in 1998 that cemented the ground beneath her feet. Marie is on an Alliance Francaise-sponsored tour of India with the recent publication of the English translation of the novel that deals with the friendship between a divorced mother and a drug addict baby-sitter.

 ?I had a baby-sitter who I later found out to be an addict,? says Marie, admitting that she used a lot of life around her in her work. This practice though has meant that her children keep their secrets from her. ?My nine-year-old was going to a friend?s house. When I asked who, she said she wouldn?t tell me, as she feared I would put that in my book,? the flabbergasted mother recalls. 

 Calcutta has been full of amazements ? ?so much colour and smell?. ?I have seen little statues of Kali in houses of Indians in Paris but never thought they could be so big,? she says. Yet despite all the experience gathered on the tour, there is no India novel coming from Marie. ?Every country has its own story-tellers, isn?t it?? she smiles.

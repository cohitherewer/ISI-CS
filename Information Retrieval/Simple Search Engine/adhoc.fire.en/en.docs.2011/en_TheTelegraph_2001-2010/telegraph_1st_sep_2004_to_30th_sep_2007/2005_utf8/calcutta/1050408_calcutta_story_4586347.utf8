A property developer is robbed of Rs 20,000 and 

assaulted by a gang for resisting extortion.

He goes to a police station to lodge a complaint, 

but finds the officer-in-charge chatting with two of the gang members.

The officer demands that the realtor produce a 

medical report before his complaint is registered. On leaving the thana, the realtor 

is roughed up by the same gang again.

 The incident, which punches a hole in the chief minister?s claim of the state being one of the best policed in the country, occurred at Kantatala bus stop, off the Calcutta Leather Complex, on Thursday.

 The victim, Manas Biswas, is now lying in the surgical ward of National Medical College and Hospital with critical injuries.

 Biswas was on his way to the leather complex when a gang of youths, led by Swadesh Mondal and Khokan Biswas, blocked the way and asked him to get off his motorcycle. The two had been threatening Biswas for a long time over ?protection money?.

 As an altercation ensued, the gang members started assaulting him. Biswas slumped to the ground, after which Swadesh repeatedly hit him on the head with a revolver. 

 ?I could hear Khokan egging on Swadesh to shoot me,? Biswas later said. The gang then took out his wallet and left the spot, leaving Biswas bleeding on the road.

 With the help of local residents, Biswas returned home and narrated the incident to wife Anjali, who took him to Calcutta Leather Complex police station to lodge a complaint. There, the couple allegedly found officer-in-charge Rabi Kumar Chanda in conversation with Swadesh and Khokan.

 ?The officer asked me to go to a hospital first and get a doctor to ascertain the nature of my injuries. Only then would he allow me to file my complaint,? Biswas told Metro.

 As he was leaving the police station, some of Swadesh?s henchmen beat him up again. He finally reached National Medical College and Hospital with the help of family members and friends.

 Additional superintendent of police (rural) C.K. Dutta said: ?I shall probe the allegations and also ask the officer-in-charge to arrest the culprits at the earliest.?

 On henna call

SANGITA SULTANIA G. ROY

Mehndi and men don?t come together only on 

D-day when many a hapless groom is made to sport hennaed hands and feet. In a 

reverse case of gender bender, boys are now taking to the profession of applying 

mehndi.

 ?It?s all about the quality of your work,? shrugs Deepak Silodia, painstakingly making intricate patterns on the hands of a girl. The 18-year-old was initially drawn to the profession by the prospect of travelling widely, and so far he has been on henna call as far as Mumbai and Goa.

 If making a quick buck was another attraction, Deepak isn?t doing too bad, charging Rs 2,100 for a bridal and Rs 100 for a pair of hands or feet, otherwise. During peak wedding season, prior appointment for bridals must be made ?at least a month in advance?.

 There is absolutely no stigma attached to the profession for a guy, according to Deepak, but he does refrain from telling his friends exactly what he does, lest they laugh at him. 

 Coming from a family of professional henna artists, Deepak picked up the tricks of the trade from his mother and has added some trendy twists of his own to the art. If you hire his services on the occasion of a wedding in the family, he will create motifs like bride and bridegroom, a groom?s party, palki and other symbols of an Indian wedding. For other occasions, the trend doing the rounds is known by the name of Arabian mehndi with prominent borders and intricate fillings.

 Contrary to popular belief, the non-Bengali community is not the only one that keeps the likes of Deepak busy through the year. ?Bengalis have caught on to the idea of applying mehndi in a big way and unlike before, today the mehndi is a must in most Bengali weddings as well,? says Deepak.

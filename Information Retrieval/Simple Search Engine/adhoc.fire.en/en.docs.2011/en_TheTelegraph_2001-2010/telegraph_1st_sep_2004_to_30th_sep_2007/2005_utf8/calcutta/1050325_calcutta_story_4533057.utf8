The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Telecom agitation over, calls clog networks 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The telecommunications network in and around the city was limping back to normal on Thursday, following the withdrawal of the nine-day protest of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) executives.

 However, the one problem that still exists is congestion ? the result of the large number of calls subscribers tried to make during the agitation. 

 ?The congestion was caused because of the disproportion between the number of calls tried and the availability of the local junction network,? a CalTel official explained.

 Sources said network load increased sharply immediately after the agitation ended. 

 Several calls ? from landlines to cellphones, landlines to landlines and long- distance ones ? are not getting through because of the congestion. 

 The problem intensified between 11 am and 3 pm on Thursday, they said.

 ?Subscribers should wait if they cannot get through to a number at once and then try again,? an official said. 

 Restoration work, he told Metro, is being undertaken on a war footing and ?we expect things to become normal by Friday?. 

 The United Forum for BSNL Executives assured the telecom authorities that its members would work round-the-clock to ensure that the network was back to normal. 

 ?Our executives are engaged in repair work and 85 per cent of the work is done,? said Forum spokesperson Amit Gupta. 

 Sources said around 20 base transmission stations (network towers for cellphones) developed faults because of problems in the optical fibre link. 

 Besides, a number of lease lines, that connect commercial establishments and corporate houses with their headquarters and branch offices, did not function following snags in the copper and optical fibre cables. 

 ?The problems will be resolved by the end of the day,? assured an official.

 Superintendent of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital Pradip Mitra said: ?The phones are working smoothly now.? 

 Railway and airport officials concurred.

 The picture, however, is not so bright in the West Bengal Telecom sector. ?Wednesday?s storm and rain hampered restoration work,? said an official.

 The executives? protest had crippled the communication network in Calcutta and other parts of the state. Around 50,000 officials, including 4,000 from Bengal, joined the protest.

 The widespread disruption in basic telephone services and in some mobile phone networks had prompted chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to seek Union communication minister Dayanidhi Maran?s help to break the stalemate.

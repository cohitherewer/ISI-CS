The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 In defiance of indifference

 JULIUS GOMES 

 ?Our law-keepers have turned law-breakers, leaving us citizens with few choices. The police officer may have compromised on his duty, but I cannot sit quiet without doing mine.? 

 So said Rumki Chakraborty, who accompanied her friend Feroza Khatoon to the Bhabani Bhavan office of H.K. Kusumakar, additional superintendent of police (industrial), on Thursday.

 ?I had accompanied my friend, who had been sexually harassed, to lodge a complaint with Keorapukur police outpost, but I got harassed there myself,? Rumki said. 

 Rather than assist the two women and record their complaint promptly, duty officer A.K. Saha had allegedly implied that Feroza must have provoked her tormentor, Jiyad Ali Sheikh, in some way. He had also raised doubts about Rumki?s relation with Feroza, since she had accompanied Feroza instead of a relative. (Feroza?s father is a cancer patient and her mother is a housewife.)

 Late in the evening of March 9, Feroza was returning to her Haridevpur home, in South 24-Parganas, when Jiyad accosted her. Grabbing her by the arm, Jiyad had allegedly tried to molest her. Feroza managed to break free and ran home. The very next day, Feroza?s brother was beaten up when he confronted Jiyad. Since then, they are being terrorised by Jiyad. 

 ?Jiyad had threatened to kill me and destroy the lives of my relatives,? Feroza said. Pushed to the brink, she had confided in Rumki, and they decided to lodge a complaint with Keorapukur police outpost on Tuesday.

 Rumki had related an embarrassed Feroza?s story to the ?reluctant and casual? Saha, and also submitted some pornographic pictures wrapped in a plastic bag that Jiyad had been slipping into Feroza?s bathroom.

 Rumki?s complaint, submitted to Kusumakar, states that Saha had ?misbehaved? with her and had refused to lodge Feroza?s complaint.

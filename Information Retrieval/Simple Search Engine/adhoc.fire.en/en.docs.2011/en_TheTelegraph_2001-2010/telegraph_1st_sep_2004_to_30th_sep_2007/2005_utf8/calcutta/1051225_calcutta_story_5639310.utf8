 Of glorious uncertainties

 With Team India both the medium and the message, betting Rs 300 crore on it takes some doing

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 This was last Monday. The news was carried on the front pages. Sahara has managed to retain the sponsorship of the Indian cricket team. They won the contract by offering to pay over Rs 300 crore for the four-year period commencing 2006.

 There were of course murmurs; after all Rs 300 crore is not a small sum. Has Sahara gone overboard? Last time they had paid Rs 78 crore. What prompted them to quadruple the offer? The advisers to Sahara were confident ? ?the valuation of the current deal may look stiff, but do the cost-benefit analysis and (you will realise that) by any standard it?s a steal.? Such analysis must have been done by all the bidders in the fray. None of them quoted less than Rs 250 crore. So there must be some merit in the deal. After all, a petroleum major, a significant mobile service provider and a large ?infocom? company cannot possibly independently make the same mistake.

 In this deal, the real benefit will come from the TV exposure. The four-year period of the contract involves 110 One-Dayers and 44 Tests. That would add up to 330 cricketing days. A conservative six-hours-a-day exposure on TV would mean 2,000 hours or 120,000 minutes or 240,000 half-a-minute exposures ? the usual duration of a TV ad. The cost per exposure will work out to Rs 12,500. And this back-of-the-envelope calculation does not even include exposures through snapshots in newspapers, photo features in magazines, and the highlights programme on TV.

 Then there is more. The sponsor will enjoy exposure at moments when no other ad is disturbing the viewer. And what moments they are: Sachin?s century, Pathan?s jubilation, Dravid?s victory speech? They are rare combinations of celebrity presence and national glory. So by all accounts, Rs 300 crore for 2.5 lakh such moments would indeed appear to be a steal.

 There is just one issue. A sponsorship deal is different from, say, purchase of telecast rights of a cricket match. In the case of a telecast right, the major advantage is that the cost of a deal and its benefit ? advertising revenues ? are both measurable in rupee terms. The problem with a sponsorship deal is that you pay hard cash to get it but despite all the arithmetic of the preceding paragraphs, the real benefits remain soft and perceptual. This is so because the sponsorship only offers opportunity to expose. Exposure unfortunately cannot be the end goal ? what it does to the brand would constitute the real benefit. There lurks the danger.

 The Team India sponsorship deal allows a logo on the chest and the leading arm of each player selected in the team. This presumably means that the logo is the only communication agent permissible. That puts severe constraint on communication. For a start, a logo on the chest can easily become part of the scenery, robbing it of the power of sending signals to the consumer. Even otherwise, when Sehwag lifts Shoaib over third man for a six, what would we the viewers in front of a television set be focusing on? Sehwag?s grin, Shoaib?s glare, Inzamam?s sigh or the logo on Sehwag?s sweater? The Rs 300-crore question is, would the moments and the stars overshadow the logo?

 Finally, there is this issue about the medium and the message. This sponsorship is a case of the medium being the message. Team India is the medium and also the message. A winning India or at least a competitive India is thus a critical condition for the logo to deliver any value to its owners. Four years is a long time in cricket. Sachin?s elbow, Pawar?s election, Ganguly?s return, Raina?s talent ? all these are imponderables. So is the performance of the Indian team in the long run.

 As they say, cricket is a game of glorious uncertainties. Betting Rs 300 crore on it takes some doing.

 Merry Christmas!

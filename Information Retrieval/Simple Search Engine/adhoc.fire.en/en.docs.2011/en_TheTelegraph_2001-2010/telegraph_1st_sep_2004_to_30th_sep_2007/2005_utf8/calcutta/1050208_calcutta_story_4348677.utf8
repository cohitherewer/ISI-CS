The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 It's Your Birthday So...

 You?re 

a fine mix of materialism and spirituality. You have the ability to appreciate 

and uphold customs and traditions. You enjoy the company of erudite people. You?re 

very emotional and a romantic by nature. You?re happiest in your dream world. 

You work best independently. Others may misunderstand your actions, but not for 

too long. ? Kusum Bhandari

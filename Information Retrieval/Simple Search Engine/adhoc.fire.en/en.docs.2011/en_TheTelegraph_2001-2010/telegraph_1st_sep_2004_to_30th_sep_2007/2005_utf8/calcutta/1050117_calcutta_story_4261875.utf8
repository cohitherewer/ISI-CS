 Tip nets dacoit daughter 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A mother?s tip-off helped the police net her dacoit daughter.

 Piu Das, 20, was rounded up from Makardah, Howrah, on Sunday morning. Her mother, Susama, provided the raiding team with information about her hideout and a photograph that helped identify her. 

 Piu was wanted in connection with a dacoity at a primary health centre in Khaberia, Bishnupur, on the southern fringes of the city.

 An armed gang of seven, led by Piu, looted Rs 6.75 lakh from the health centre on January 3. Though four members of the gang had been arrested and Rs 2.3 lakh seized from them, Piu and ?husband? Buro Banerjee had been eluding police.

 Superintendent of South 24-Parganas police S.N. Gupta said Piu?s mother had informed the cops that the girl had taken shelter in her aunt?s house in Makardah. ?My men raided the house early in the morning and arrested her.?

 The four dacoits arrested earlier told police that Piu had married thrice. But she claimed during interrogation that she had married Asoke Mondal at 17, and had lived-in with the other two men. 

 Police have come to know that Piu had murdered her first husband with the help of another woman. 

 Superintendent Gupta said Piu changed her address quite frequently. ?We are looking for Buro and another person involved in the the dacoity.?

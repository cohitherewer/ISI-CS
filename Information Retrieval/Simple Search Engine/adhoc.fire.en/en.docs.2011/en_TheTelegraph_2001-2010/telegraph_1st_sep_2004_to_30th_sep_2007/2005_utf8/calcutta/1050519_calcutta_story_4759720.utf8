 Fan to figurehead

 Hayden Christensen, Ewan McGregor and Samuel L. 

Jackson in Revenge of the Sith

Throughout the 28-year history of the Star Wars saga, several actors have portrayed Darth Vader. But only one has fully brought to life the man behind the mask, Anakin Skywalker, a heroic Jedi knight ruthlessly manipulated into joining the dark side of the Force. Hayden Christensen first became Anakin in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, and he reprises the role in Revenge of the Sith.

 Christensen already has an impressive CV, starring Golden Globe and SAG Award nominations for his work in Life as a House and impressing critics with his role as shamed journalist Stephen Glass in Shattered Glass. He has also appeared on the West End stage in Kenneth Lonergan?s This Is Our Youth. But he says no role has been as highly visible or indelible as Anakin Skywalker.

 So, what?s different about Anakin in Revenge of the Sith? Well, he?s more grown up, says Christensen. ?Anakin was a petulant, impertinent teenager in Attack of the Clones, and in Revenge of the Sith he has grown up. He has a wife, he has responsibilities and he has ambition. He is also leading a secret life? and that?s very difficult for him.?

 Star Wars fans might have wanted Anakin to be ?wonderfully heroic, a perfect person?. But he?s a tragic hero, with flaws. ?He is tempted by a master manipulator and he succumbs. The reasons he goes to the dark side have their roots in very recognisable, very human emotions. He?s someone who wants to be great, but never will or can achieve that greatness.?

 And yes, for all you curious cats out there, the man is really under the mask in Episode III, when Darth Vader emerges. ?Getting the chance to be in the Darth Vader costume was something I was looking forward to from the day I found out I got the part. They created a new costume designed to fit me,? recalls Christensen.

 Vader is almost seven feet tall, so lifts were put in his shoes and a muscle suit was put on him to make the Hollywood hunk look even bigger. ?It was like walking around with 40-pound weights on your shoulders, and it wasn?t easy, but it was something I?ll never forget,? adds Christensen. 

 How he landed the part, convincing writer-director George Lucas to hire him after the audition at Skywalker Ranch, Christensen isn?t sure, although he attributes it partly to his own dark side. ?George gave me a hat and a mug? I still have them. I was living in Canada at the time, and I was fast asleep when they called to say that I had gotten the part. I thought I was dreaming. The first person I called was my mom, and she screamed at the top of her lungs. I don?t think I?ll ever forget that day.?

 Although a childhood Star Wars fan, the 23-year-old went over the previous movies religiously. It was the light saber duel with Obi-Wan Kenobi ? the climax to Revenge of the Sith ? that was one of the toughest tasks. ?I got to Sydney, Australia, where we shot the movie, three months before production began to get ready. I had to eat about six meals a day and work out almost all the time... The duel is very carefully choreographed, so there were hundreds of moves that I needed to learn. I?m really proud of the final result.?

 It?s a dream come true for the young star to be Anakin Skywalker and Darth Vader. ?It?s something I could never have imagined, and is more exciting than I can even begin to describe.?

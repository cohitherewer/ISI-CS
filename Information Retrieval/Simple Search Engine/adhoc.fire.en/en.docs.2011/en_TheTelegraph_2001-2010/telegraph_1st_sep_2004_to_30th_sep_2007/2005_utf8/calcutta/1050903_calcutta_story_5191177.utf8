 Police on Puja backfoot

 - Crowd-pullers refuse to toe cop festive line

 A STAFF REPORTER

 With little over a month left for the Pujas, organisers have begun bullying the cops into softening their stand on the imposition of festive ground rules.

 On Friday, after two days of a marathon meeting with police top brass, almost all mega-budget puja organisers across the city protested the proposed curbs. The grumbles against the guidelines ? ranging from road-encroachment bar on pandals to checks on billboards ? may not have been loud, but they were unified enough to not go unheard. And all that the police top brass could do was plead with organisers to abide by the directives.

 Police were clearly unprepared to hear mega puja organisers speak out in unison. ?We have called upon organisers to ensure that the directives are adhered to in the best of spirits. We are not trying to enforce our rules but urging them to help us run the show,? said Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters). 

 The organisers, on their part, have expressed reservations on a few issues, including encroachment of road space to set up pandals, the mandatory clearance of a 12 ft road, denial of permission to open stalls on pavements and carriageways, and finally, curb on the trimming of trees.

 ?Clearance and all that are fine but let us make one thing clear. We will surely abide by rules but if certain rules are imposed that would force us to curtail our elaborate arrangements, then we will think twice. It?s no joke. Ours is one of the biggest crowd-pullers in this city and we know how to go about it,? said Pradip Ghosh, organising secretary of Santosh Mitra Square Sarbojanin Durgostav. 

 Others may not be as defiant but they have their own points of protest. Organisers of the Simla Byayam Samity, for instance, say they would review the number of loudspeakers to abide by the sound norms. ?But we have our reservations regarding the strictures on road encroachment. We will do our best but it may not be in strict adherence to the norm,? Ashok Das, one of the key members of Simla Byayam Samity, another crowd-puller in the north. 

 On Thursday, some organisers from north and central Calcutta had expressed their inability to abide by all the rules. On Friday, their counterparts from the south and Port division along with those from the eastern end echoed similar concerns.

 ?Let the CMC and the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority ensure that the pavements near Lady Brabourne College are cleared and hawkers are not allowed to visit the park. We will then do our bit. There are different aspects which the agencies need to look at before asking us to look after ourselves,? said Raghu Dasgupta, one of the key functionaries of Park Circus Puja Committee.

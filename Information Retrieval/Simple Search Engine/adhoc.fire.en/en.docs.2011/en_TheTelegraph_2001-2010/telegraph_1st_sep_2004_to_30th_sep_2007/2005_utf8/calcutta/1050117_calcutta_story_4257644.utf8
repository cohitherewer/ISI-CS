 Love stories on canvas

 The ability to touch and relive the idyllic beauty and peacefulness of the past is a rare artistic gift that Atin Mitra uses with great elan in his paintings. The ongoing exhibition of his works in wash and tempera bears witness to this faculty, at the same time highlighting an absolute mastery over his chosen medium. Based on the Bengal school, the paintings on show depict themes from nature, mythology and divine love. While some portray platonic admiration, others deal with the romantic, aesthetic love between Lord Krishna and Radha. Mitra?s paintings of village belles in solitary contemplation or engaged in leisurely conversation with their companions, suggest a latent energy, excitement and longing underneath an air of repose and tranquility.

 Event: Painting exhibition by Atin Mitra

 When: Till today, 10 am - 7 pm

 Where: Chemould Art Gallery, 12F Park Street

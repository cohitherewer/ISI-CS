The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Virtual bazaar scouts city sellers

 TechTalk

 A chance to reach out to millions 

 of buyers across 33 countries at virtually no cost. That 

 was the offer from eBay as it invited ?Bengalis to become 

 entrepreneurs? on Saturday.

 The Indian subsidiary of the world?s 

 largest online marketplace ? formerly Baazee.com ? organised 

 eBay Academy, a session to spread awareness among potential 

 traders in Calcutta.

 ?Since March 2004, we have organised 

 around 18 such seminars which have been attended by at least 

 14,000 people,? said Samarjeet Singh, head, eBay Academy.

 The two sessions in Calcutta saw 

 over 400 people filling up the auditorium. Animated stories 

 and interactions with successful sellers were the tools 

 used to explain how eBay works.

 ?Students, housewives and people 

 on the verge of retirement or looking for an alternative 

 to the job they are presently doing, comprised the crowd 

 here,? said Singh.

 ?In terms of difference in crowd 

 profile, there are usually more traders participating in 

 cities like Chennai and Delhi,? he added.

 For those interested in learning 

 more, eBay offers a one-and-a-half-hour live online advanced 

 training package costing Rs 99. 

 The online platform allows many 

 to sell to many. Sellers can list their items on the site, 

 free of charge. When the items are purchased, eBay charges 

 the seller a five per cent ?value fee?.

 There are promotional schemes 

 that sellers can avail of as well, like placing their items 

 on the home page, said Singh.

 A rating system, where sellers 

 and buyers assess each other?s performance, helps to maintain 

 a standard and keep rogue traders in check. 

 The mental block of Indian shoppers 

 against online transactions is clearing slowly, feel some 

 of the sellers.

 But a few problems still remain. 

 ?Often some buyers treat the process as a joke and place 

 bids for fun, not recognising the time and effort spent 

 by us,? complained jewellery trader N.K. Gupta. ?The buying 

 community must become more mature.?

 From art and antiques to books 

 and magazines, computers to electronic gadgets and bikes 

 to jewellery, products spread over 2,500 categories are 

 available on eBay.

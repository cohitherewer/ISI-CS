With eye make-up travelling well beyond the traditional kajal and adding volume to eyelashes, changing the shape of the brows and even concealing the unwanted wrinkles around the eyes, its time to make sure that the world looks at you differently. With a number of Indian and international brands offering a wide variety, one can be spoilt for choice. The consciousness is on the rise and people are ready to upgrade their brands, moving from Revlon to Chambor and higher still, says Santanu Ghosh manager, Shoppers Stop, City Centre.

Beginners guide

 For those just starting out, its vital to understand what each product can do for the eye. Also crucial are the steps to a well made-up eye and the ingredients required to get that look. There are two types of eye make-up which require you to buy very different products, says make-up artist Aniruddha Chakladar. While the commonly-used one is the daily wear look that one can use in the workplace, the market and the movies, the other heavier one goes with the party look. For the day make-up, one should just use kohl and eye mascara, while the elaborate make-up would require eye foundation, eye-shadow, eye-liner besides the kohl and mascara, shares Aniruddha. 

 So, depending on which make-up you are more likely to don, you could tailor your shopping list. If you have spots or dark circles around your eyes, you need to pick up a concealer as well. 

Popular picks

 The largest range of colours in eye-make up is available in eye pencils (for kohl and contour) and eye shadows. Brands like Bourjois, Nina Ricci and Shiseido stock over a dozen different shades in both items, giving the wearer a chance to match make-up with every mood. Others like LOreal, Revlon, Maybelline and Lakme also have an impressive range. While blacks and browns do well with the conventional customer, the more adventurous opt for the mauves, pinks, blues and even greens, says a spokesperson for Royal in New Market. 

 These pencils are extremely handy on a regular basis since they can accentuate the look of the face, explains Aniruddha. 

 Eye shadows that help bring out the dressy look are available across all international brands including Pupa, Clarins, LOreal and Chambor, in both powder and cream forms. The creamy eye shadows are perfect for those who have dry lids, says Aniruddha.

 Some brands like Chambor, Nina Ricci and Shiseido have eye-shadow colours ranging from neutral shades to bright hues, including greens and shocking pinks, says a spokesperson for Shoppers Stop, City Centre, boasting sole counters of brands like Bourjois and Shiseido.

 Eye mascara helps give the lashes the desired length, volume and curls. The colours on sale across brands are black, brown, grey and blue, with some having wider palettes. Both Chambor and Shiseido have the all-in-one mascara that helps to add length, volume and curve to the lashes. 

 Those used to the liquid eye-liner can pick up the range of felt-pen liners, now readily available. These work like sketch pens and save the trouble of messy brushes.

Special tools

 While the range of products is similar across counters, there are some items available at only select outlets. You could pick up the Eyelash curler priced at Rs 375, the natural combing mascara priced at Rs 1,100, the eyebrow setter priced at Rs 1,200, and the eraser pencil priced at Rs 625, from the Shiseido counter. The transparent mascara that doesnt add colour to your lashes but lengthens it is available only at Bourjois, for Rs 400.

Price tag

 Prices differ with brands but for all international buys, one would have to dish out Rs 300 to Rs 1,500, on an average, depending on the label, of course.

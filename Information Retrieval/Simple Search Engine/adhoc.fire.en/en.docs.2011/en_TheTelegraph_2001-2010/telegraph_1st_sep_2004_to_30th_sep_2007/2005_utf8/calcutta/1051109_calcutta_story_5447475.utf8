The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 The security personnel do not pay much heed to the verification the identity of the porters at Calcutta airport. Beside, uniformed staff of private airlines are often allowed to go beyond the security check area without identity cards. What if the uniform is just a guise? Previously, there have been goof-ups at airports in India. And there is no guarantee that it wouldn?t happen again. There should be restrictions on entry of porters into the airport. The Airport Authority of India can come up with separate identity cards for porters who are allowed to enter the airport premises. 

 Sumant Poddar,

 Kyd Street. 

 We, the inhabitants of Ramkrishna Palli, under ward 109, are severely affected by lack of civic amenities like drinking water, proper sewerage lines and sturdy roads. This, despite paying taxes to the Corporation regularly. We request the local councillor and the civic body?s Jadavpur unit to take steps to redress our grievance at the earliest. 

 Sukumar Ghosh, Mukundapur. 

 During a recent visit to Guwahati, I found that the state bus service Rhino is of international standard. The air-conditioned vehicles have ample legroom and comfortable seats. The low footboards are a great help to the elderly, women and children. Surprisingly, the fares are very nominal. Why can?t Calcutta have such buses?

 Amit V. Sengupta,

 The civic board has abandoned its plans to review the scheme to redevelop College Street Market and adopted a softer stand in favour of the private developer. 

 The previous civic board had shown the green light to the joint-venture project. It will now be executed with some modifications of the terms and conditions.

 The modifications ratified in the civic house on Thursday include:

 4Reduction of lease period from 60 years to 30 years. The lease will be given to tenants and not the developer

 4A premium of Rs 2 crore to be paid at the time of signing the agreement. There will be no instalment facility

 4At least 60 per cent of the developer?s space has to be utilised to set up the book hub

 To ensure that there is a book hub in the revamped market, the developer will have to form an advisory board of noted writers and publishers from the state. The board will monitor the progress of the project.

 The private party will have to submit letters from at least seven noted writers and publishers, agreeing to be on the advisory board.

 The scheme to redevelop College Street Market was conceived as a joint venture between the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and the Bengal Shelter Housing Development Limited, a partner of the West Bengal Housing Board.

 Though the discussion started over the development of College Street Market in 2003, the scheme got the nod from the last civic board only 19 days before the June 19 municipal polls. The decision was conveyed (letter no. Con/com/46/2005-2006) to Bengal Shelter Housing Development Ltd. the same day.

 Then municipal commissioner Debashis Som, however, observed in his note that ?signing an agreement for redevelopment of the market requires approval of mayoral council as well as the CMC?. 

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya and his mayoral council, after assuming power, put the contract under the scanner. The board felt the pact should be cancelled because of lack of transparency.

 According to CMC insiders, the stance has changed due to two reasons: the previous board had officially conveyed to the private party that its proposal had been accepted and the private partner had already invested money in the project. 

 It has been decided that the 16.5-bigha Marcus Square, on Madan Mohan Burman Street, will be used to offer temporary rehabilitation of the 1,200 stall-owners of the seven-bigha College Street market during the period of renovation.

 The renovated market will come up on a build-operate-transfer basis. It will be the first time the CMC will replace a structure built during British rule.

 The CMC spends over Rs 3 crore a year to maintain College Street Market. The annual revenue from the market is Rs 22 lakh.

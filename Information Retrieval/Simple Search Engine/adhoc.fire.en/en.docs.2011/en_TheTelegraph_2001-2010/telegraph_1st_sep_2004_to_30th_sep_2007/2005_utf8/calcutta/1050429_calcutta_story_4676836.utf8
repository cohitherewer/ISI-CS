Mission education 

 In the Narkeldanga-Rajabazar area, population is dense, poverty is prevalent, proper education for the majority of children remains a distant dream and child labour is rampant. Therefore, an extra effort is required to bring these children into the fold of elementary education. 

 Keeping this in mind, Vikramshila Education Resource Society, Banga Education Society (working in the field of education towards the goal of universalising quality elementary education) and members of the local community will jointly hold an enrolment drive, with support from the state project office of Paschim Banga Rajya Prarambhik Shiksha Unnayan Sanstha. 

 The drive will be held in two phases, on April 30 and May 2, during Education for All week, which is being observed from April 24 to April 30. The theme will be ?Send My Friend to School?. 

 The idea behind this drive is to identify out-of-school children of the area. The school inspector from the state SSA office will be present and will issue green cards to the identified children for admission into government schools. 

 The drive will be spearheaded by the children of Nabadisha, a joint programme of Vikramshila, Calcutta Police and Child Relief and You (CRY). 

 This Saturday, the drive will start at 4 pm from Narkeldanga Police Station and end at 6 pm in the open ground adjacent to Momin High School in Narkeldanga. On May 2, it will kick off from the same destination and end at the Calcutta Municipal Corporation School on Raja Dinendra Street in Rajabazar.

 Township taps dry as mercury soars

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Summer has just set in and the taps are already running dry in pockets of Salt Lake.

 Large areas of the township are suffering from a severe water crisis, with reservoirs not getting filled up to even half their capacities. 

 Many residents are buying water for basic household chores. The situation is particularly bad in Sectors I and II, where residents allege that the water supply has reduced by two-thirds the usual quota. 

 P.N. Banerjee, secretary of AJ block residents? association, said: ?In most houses in this block, even half of the reservoir is not being filled up.? 

 At a block meeting held on Sunday, residents claimed that they were not getting water even for their daily washing and cleaning.

 ?Some don?t even get enough water to bathe. Cleaning the ferrules several times has not helped in improving the condition,? Banerjee said.

 ?The crisis is because three of the four filters of water tank no. eight, which supplies water to the entire locality, are out of order. The tank is not properly maintained and needs immediate repairs,? pointed out Tulsi Sinha Roy, councillor of ward 12, which includes AJ block.

 According to the local residents, the pipelines, although cleaned from time to time by the municipal authorities, get choked as the iron content in the water is extremely high. 

 ?Besides, the tank being situated at the other end of the township, we do not get the water supplied from Tallah-Palta waterworks,? she added.

 Residents had earlier lodged a complaint with Bidhannagar Municipality. ?The municipality is carrying out repairs for the past 10 days but there has been no improvement,? the councillor said.

 The crisis has become severe since Saturday, said N.C. Dutta, secretary of CE block residents? association. ?Water is supplied three times a day but each time, after half an hour, the water flow reduces and the reservoirs don?t fill up,? he said.

 Residents allege that water scarcity is an annual affair every summer. ?This year, it has assumed serious proportions and the authorities have not taken any step so far,? alleged Sabyasachi Dutta, councillor of ward 10.

 In some areas, residents are being forced to buy water from tankers. A tanker of water costs as much as Rs 400.

 The municipal authorities have, however, rubbished the allegations. ?There is no water crisis. We rectify all faults immediately,? asserted Tapan Talukdar, chairman-in-council member, Bidhannagar Municipality, in charge of water supply.

 The civic body supplies 80 lakh gallons of water to the township, of which 35 to 40 gallons come from Tallah-Palta. ?Two to three pumps are on standby at every tank so that supply is sufficient even if there is no supply from Tallah-Palta,? Talukdar pointed out.

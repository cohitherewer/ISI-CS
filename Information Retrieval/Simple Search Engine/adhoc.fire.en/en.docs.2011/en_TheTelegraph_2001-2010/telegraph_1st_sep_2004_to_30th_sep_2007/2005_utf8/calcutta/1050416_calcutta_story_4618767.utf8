 Contrasting impressions

 Modern Indian art lends itself to an abundant variety of expressions; it serves as a mirror to the social environment and, at the same time, offers insights into the depths of the human mind. Work Shop Art, the ongoing exhibition of paintings by eminent artists, presents a collection of works which, though expressing personal feelings and emotions, also seeks to understand and come to terms with the ubiquitous human predicament. Images of love, beauty and serenity are set against works that depict lust, greed and hostility to portray a view of life that is as pleasing in its geniality as it is perplexing in its complexity. Featuring paintings by Shuvaprasanna, Shyamal Dutta Roy, Paritosh Sen, Subrata Gangopadhyay (Two Women; picture above), Lalu Prasad Shaw, Aditya Basak and Chandra Bhattacharya, among others, the show?s uniqueness lies in its success in bringing together a vast diversity of works, created in different moods and reflecting totally contrasting perspectives of life.

 Event: Exhibition of paintings by well-known artists

 When: Till today; 11 am - 7 pm

 Where: Gandhara Art Gallery, Palm Spring, Flat 5A, 1B Gurusaday Road

 Its that time of the year again when music comes alive in the canteen, the library, the table tennis room and even on the basketball court. For, Indias largest inter-college rock music competition, Hero Honda and Pepsi Campus Rock Idols, is all set for Edition Two, also called Tour of 2005. 

 This year, the competition has taken a new meaning altogether with members of the popular Finnish rock band The Rasmus being on the jury of two regional finals ? the west and south zones.

 The band will go on to two live performances in Mumbai and Bangalore on December 2 and 4. Prestorika, winners of last years Campus Rock Idols, will perform alongside The Rasmus.

 The contest this year will be held in 12 cities over a two-month period, culminating on December 16 at a grand finale in Goa.

 While The Rasmus wont be at all the venues, senior representatives from the music industry will shortlist winners in the regional rounds, to be held at Indore, Hyderabad, Delhi, Manipal, Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Bangalore, Shillong, Pune and Calcutta.

 After the regional finals at Chandigarh, Bangalore, Pune and Calcutta, the show shifts to Goa where the winning college will be crowned.

 We are trying to ensure they have a good time, a recollection that they can carry for the rest of their lives and a chance to perform with an international rock group, says Venkat Vardhan, managing director of DNA Networks, the event managers. 

 Apart from bagging the title, the winners will get the opportunity to perform alongside an international iconic artiste, promoted by DNA Networks.

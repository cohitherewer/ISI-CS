Life

 Pages on the pretty princess

 After a week focussed on Charles and Camilla, turn your attention to the omniscient 

Diana. The beloved ?people?s princess? has lost none of her popularity and Calcutta-based 

loyalists, too, can keep the candle burning. A book has hit city shelves, Diana 

? The Portrait, that reconstructs the magic of the tragic figure. 

Described as ?keenly decorous?, this hefty volume 

has been authorised by Diana?s estate and memorial fund, so don?t expect any sleaze 

or smut here. Almost 500 pictures ? a few of which have never been published before 

? are accompanied with detailed text by Rosalind Coward. 

This is not a biography. It dwells mainly on her humanitarian 

work, largely side-stepping her tumultuous personal life.

With a forward by Nelson Mandela, the book has tried 

to capture how the Princess of Wales reached out to millions through her social 

work, managing to touch the individuals that make up the hungry masses. In keeping 

with its theme, profits from the coffee table book will go to causes supported 

by the memorial fund.

The style icon was one of the most photographed faces 

of her time. In the glossy book there are a number of familiar images, as well 

as some that are new, culled from family archives and other private records. Published 

in 2004, the book was accompanied by the ?authorised? calendar, which included 

13 more snapshots of the pretty-as-a-picture princess.

While the text, which incorporates the testimonies 

of hundreds of friends and acquaintances, has been criticised as being ?over worshipful?, 

it captures the enduring spirit of the woman who the world was obsessed with, 

well beyond her premature death in a 1997 car crash.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Our own Rooney, in true colours

 - English Premier League promo in Para football 

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 Local hero: Wayne Rooney of Manchester United

 The city?s guardian as organiser and one of the leading sports broadcasters the promoter. 

 Throw in flavours of English Premier League (EPL) and a trip to England for a bunch of players, and para football in the city never had it so good.

 Calcutta Police?s annual tournament, the Friendship Cup, will not only have the local Ronaldos and Rooneys battle it out on the ground this time, but also see them wearing the jerseys of England?s top clubs.

 ?We kick-started our campaign for promoting English Premier League by tying up with Calcutta Police for this event,? says Nirmal Dayani, director (marketing), ESPN STAR Sports.

 Around 500 clubs registered for the seventh edition of Friendship Cup, of which 54 have already moved to the next round. August 13 onwards, matches will determine the best 10 and on August 22, the winner.

 ?We divided the city into five regions ? north, south, east, central and port ? and asked football-lovers to vote which EPL club, they think, teams from a particular region play like,? explains Dayani.

 As a result, the top two teams from the south will don the colours of Manchester United, while those from the north, central, port and east will wear the jerseys of Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal and Everton, respectively.

 ?The idea is to reach out to the youth through the tournament and what better way than a channel which is most in tune with the young people?? offers Zulfiquar Hassan, joint commissioner (armed police) of Calcutta Police.

 Besides weekly highlights being aired on ESPN and STAR Sports, five top players of Friendship Cup get the chance to go on a ?sport education? trip to England as well.

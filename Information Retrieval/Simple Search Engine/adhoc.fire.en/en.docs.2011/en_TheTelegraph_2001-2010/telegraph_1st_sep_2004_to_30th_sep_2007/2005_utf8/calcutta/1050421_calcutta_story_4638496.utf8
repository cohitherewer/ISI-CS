 Kathak carnival

 As a classical dance form, Kathak embraces different themes and styles of performance, giving it a colourful, composite character. Navrang, a series of nine Kathak compositions, seeks to discover anew its various aspects, weaving together all its intra-forms to present a choreography that is both visually delightful and aesthetically pleasing. Surya Dhyan, the first piece, is a homage to the Sun-God. Accompanied by music and songs in classical ragas, it celebrates the Sun-God?s divine power to give light, energy and warmth. Ninaad and Tarang translate the notes of Hindustani classical music into the rhythm of Kathak steps. Pravah depicts the various moods of a river as it charts its course from its source in the snow-capped peaks to its mouth, where it surrenders itself to the sea. Jhula and Viraha paint monsoon in its contrasting colours; the former captures its joyous mood while the latter portrays its association with melancholy and loneliness. Shumar, invoking the abstract and mystic elements, Labbaik, which explores an unconventional rhythmic cycle, and Tarana, a traditional form ending with a Sufi prayer, bring down the curtains on the evening?s performance. Conceived, choreographed and directed by Rani Karnaa.

 An unusual combination of Californian grapes blended with exotic Indian cuisine ? thats the latest offering from celebrity chef Sanjeev Kapoors multi-speciality restaurant Grain of Salt.

 Kapoor was in town to host a cookery workshop on the terrace of the 22 Camac Street restaurant and also inaugurate the Californian Grape Festival.

 Quite a bit of research has gone into exploring the kind of ingredients that would help bring out the real taste of the grapes. Though exotic, all the preparations cater to the Calcutta palate, said chef Kapoor. 

 The renowned chef also presided over a cookery workshop with around 250 participants lapping up recipes of Mozzarella Cheese and Red Grapes Bruschetta, Meerutwalli Tiki, Kaju Mushroom Dum Biryani, Hariyali Paneer Makhani and Choco Jamun. While some are innovations, others are popular items women would like to know, added Kapoor.

 Sourced from the California Table Grape Commission, they come in varieties like Autumn Royal and Red Globe. These fruits are available between September and February. They are rich in Phytonutrients that help guard against various ailments. They are a good source of vitamin C too, says Rachna Sharma of The SCS Group, representing the California Table Grape Commission in India.

 On till November 27, the festival platter offers dishes like Angoori Jal Jeera, Angoori Murgh Chat (tandoori chicken salad with Californian grapes, tossed with hot and sweet chutney), Murgh Tikka Angoori Potli (chicken breast stuffed with fine Californian grape chutney and chopped grapes, steeped in chilli hot marinade, grilled in tandoor), Angoori Paneer Tikka (paneer stuffed with hot grape chutney, marinated in creamy marinade, grilled in tandoor), Fried Fish with Grape Tartar (fried fish served hot with chopped grape tartar sauce).

 These are accompanied by the Kale Aur Lal Moti Ka Pulao and Fresh Californian Grape Raita. 

 To end on a sweet note, go for the California Grapes and Rice Kheer. 

 Jamaican fare

 With Atrium at The Park playing host to the Jamaican Food Promotion, you can savour some authentic dishes from the Caribbean Islands right here on Park Street. A tribute to Jamaican culture and cuisine, its on till November 30.

 The starters include dishes like Beef, Chicken or Vegetable Pattie and Salt Fish Fritters Stamp and Go. A whiff of a warning: try the fish delicacy only if you have the stomach for the fishy fragrance!

 Sip on the Pepper Pot Soup or the Manish Water soup before moving on to the main course of Jerk Chicken with Rice and Peas, Curry Goat with Boiled Banana, Oxtail and Beans with Steamed Rice, Carrots and Chow Chow and Brown Stew Pomfret with Steamed Rice... The Roasted Pomfret with Buttered Potatoes and Vegetables, again, is not for delicate nostrils.

 Vegetarians can choose from Vegetable Rundown, Jerk Vegetable Kebabs and Curry Sweet Corn and Broccoli. Says executive chef Yvonnick Jegat Deniau: Jamaicans have picked up cooking techniques, flavours, spices and recipes from the world over, blending them with their bountiful harvest.

 Rum and Raisins Cheese Cake and Sweet Potato Pudding round off a wholesome meal that adds up to around Rs 900 for two people.

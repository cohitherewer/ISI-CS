 Holi at Presidency College. Picture by Pradip 

Sanyal

Paint me pink 

Drench me 

In your colour, 

Smear me crimson, 

Paint me pink. 

Fill the cup 

That I may drink, 

And become a whisper 

In the starry night? 

Wrap me in violets 

Tickle me blue, 

Let me swoon 

Into the greens 

And watch 

The gold dust in the air 

Turn silver 

In your eyes? 

Weave me in colour 

And let me spin 

With you, 

Into the night.

Holi-day

The world looks beautiful 

Faces are glowing, 

Vision gets blurred by 

The beautiful colours flowing. 

After a long, long wait 

It has come at last, 

So children and adults alike 

Want to enjoy it fast. 

 Nature?s beauty well known 

Is smiling at the scene, 

She is elated to see 

The fun and games begin. 

Different hues are flying around 

From the sky to the ground, 

Revealing beauty and grace 

That can be seen on every happy face. 

There is no escape 

From colours today, 

As it is none other 

Than Holi-day.

The first love of youth

The first love of youth 

Is sweetened by many tiny obstacles 

Obstacle of shame, of guardians, 

And obstacle of having no experience. 

From behind them all, 

The indication of the first introduction 

Of the first love of youth

Is colourful like the sunlight of dawn 

Is not unconcealed, reflectionless

And clear as the sunlight at noon. 

Abhinandan Bhattacharya,

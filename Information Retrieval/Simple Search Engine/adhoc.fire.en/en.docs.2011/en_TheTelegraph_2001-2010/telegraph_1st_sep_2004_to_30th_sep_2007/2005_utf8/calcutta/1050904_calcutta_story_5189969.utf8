 Selling a sojourn saga

 Why does the marketing world exploit one Puja obsession to the hilt and ignore the other?

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 This is as good a time as any to discuss the issue. Durga puja is less than five weeks away. Pujor Bajar is warming up. This is the time when our obsession with shopping gains legitimacy. The Pujas in its wake unveils another desire ? travelling out of Calcutta acquires epidemic proportions. These have never really been the best-kept secrets of this city. Yet it is curious that the world of marketing attempts to exploit one to the hilt and completely ignores the other.

 Brands whose sales peak during the Pujas bring their full might into play. Special campaigns are released in the media, shops get a facelift and festive displays are arranged. In contrast, travel is the unsung hero. The travel industry does its bit. But a brand of biscuit or battery, shampoo or soap does not feel enthused by the travel bug that afflicts their consumers. Why should they? They do not have a hotel room or an airlines seat to sell.

 Perhaps this is where we, those of us who are involved in the discipline of marketing, expose the limits of our vision. Over a cup of coffee at a conference table we all would acknowledge that marketing is all about delivery of value to consumers. The packaging we provide, the advertising we create, the promotions we run, are all attempts to add value to our brand. If asked, we will also readily concede that this value is solely dependent on what is perceived by the consumer rather than what it costs the company to provide it. And finally there will be very little debate if someone pointed out that the extent of value perceived by the consumer is directly dependent on the intensity of need.

 The Puja travel mania acquires significance in this context, even for brands that do not have any directly linkage with the Pujas. It is true that we do not shampoo our hair more frequently during the five days. Nor do we eat more biscuits. Still, the Pujas is a very good time to add value for these products. For one, these are happy times for the consumer. Associating a brand with it has obvious advantages. The second reason is perhaps more crucial. If a brand can do its bit to satisfy even a part of this strong felt-need for holiday travel, consumer gratitude is bound to translate into brand loyalty.

 There, of course, is a problem. Travel is an expensive proposition. Even a 3rd A/C ticket to Jaipur is many times the value of the price of a packet of biscuits. Yet, this unfavourable ratio can present an opportunity. The trick could be to reward continuous purchases or loyalties to a brand. Wrappers collected over the year can be redeemed at this time for a holiday package. Special trains with special facilities can be arranged. Hassles of hotel bookings can be taken away. Sightseeing can be organised?

 In these days of abundant event management skills, organising all this for any company is a matter of making the right phone call. Yet, in living memory, no Holiday Special train leaving Howrah or Sealdah has carried any branding. This is what makes complete absence of efforts in this arena so strange. 

 Marketing is all about consumer sensitivity. The thing to remember is that sensitivity should not be restricted to the arena of direct product relevance but to the life of the consumer as a whole. Being short-sighted is a very serious handicap for a marketer. You never know where opportunities may lie to strike a chord with the consumer.

 That is crucial. For, fidelity is under constant strain.

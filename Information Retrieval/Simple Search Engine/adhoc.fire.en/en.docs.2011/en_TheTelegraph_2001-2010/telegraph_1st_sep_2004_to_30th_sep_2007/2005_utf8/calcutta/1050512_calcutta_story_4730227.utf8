A career at the crossroads

 She rules over Tollywood but she is struggling for a toehold in Bollywood. RITUPARNA SENGUPTA talks to Reshmi Sengupta about the curious 

 transitional phase she finds herself in, at home and away

 Rituparna with Varun Bhadola and Rajpal Yadav in Main, Meri Patni Aur Woh

 After Chandan Arora?s Main Meri Patni Aur Woh, you are doing another Bollywood film?

 Yes, I am shooting for Uns, which is an Arabic word for love. The film is being directed by Bhupendra Gupta and I have Raj Babbar, his daughter Juhi Babbar and Sudhangshu Pandey (a Band of Boys member) as co-stars. 

 We have shot at Mahabaleshwar and on the beaches of Goa, exactly the same rocky side where Dil Chahta Hai was also shot. The film has lots of songs but very situational ones.

 Is there a fear of you getting lost in the crowd?

 My character is the central one? I play Raj Babbar?s daughter and Juhi is my best friend. Then, I get involved with Sudhangshu Pandey but when the relationship doesn?t work out, I marry somebody else on the rebound.

 What is so novel about your role in Uns?

 I play a person who is extremely emotional but very bold. What has impressed me about my character is the way she deals with her problems. Though she is shattered by the break-up with her boyfriend, she doesn?t crumble. She faces the problems and takes some important decisions.

 So, you are trying to make your presence felt in Bollywood. What is your aim?

 There are lots and lots of actresses in Bollywood and I want to be known as a sensitive actress. I don?t want to work in minor roles under big banners. I prefer films that have strong women roles. In the two Hindi films I have signed, Main Meri Patni Aur Woh and Uns, I have the more powerful and strong roles.

 How tough is the struggle to gain a foothold in Mumbai?

 Bollywood is so much more professional and organised. There?s cut-throat competition and you have to prove yourself every moment. If you can?t do this role, somebody else is there to step into your shoes. I always feel I have to give something more than what I usually do. Though I am a star in Tollywood, there are so many of them there. You tend to get lost in the crowd, but then you need to have confidence in yourself and your abilities. I think Main Meri Patni Aur Woh is going to help me a lot because Chandan Arora (who made Main Madhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hoon) has projected me as a sensitive actress. The film has been produced by UTV and will probably be released in July.

 You also have to safeguard your position at the top in Tollywood?

 You know, I am at a very sensitive point in my career where I want to do something that gives me satisfaction. I don?t want to go on a signing spree. I don?t want to do too many commercial films where I don?t get any breathing space. Because I also have a family to manage and that is very important for me. As of now, I have quite a few films to be directed by Milan Bhowmik. There?s one by Uttarayan alongside Tota Roy Chowdhury, one each by Ratan Adhikary and Tapan Banerjee. And the one to be directed by Shaibal Mitra, co-starring Kunal Mitra, is a different kind altogether. 

 Ashoke Viswanathan has an interesting role for you in his Andhakarer Shabdo...

 It is interesting because I am playing the role of an actress (in a film within the film). Something similar in the second story happens to her, in the bigger scene, and then, she also becomes the audience. Last year, I did Ashoke?s Byatikrami (yet to be released), where I played a mentally challenged character. 

 This film apart, you are doing a few more opposite Jisshu?

 Oh yes? We are there in all the Milan Bhowmik films I have signed. After shooting for Ashoke?s film today, Jisshu and I will probably be doing a peppy number for Milan Bhowmik tomorrow. A pair should have the flexibility to act in any kind of set- up.

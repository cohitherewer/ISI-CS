 No matter how old you are, no matter which part of the world you belong to, Christmas is almost surely synonymous with Santa Claus, jingle bells and the decked up tree.

 And just like spreading the cheer of the Pujas and Diwali at home, Christmas, too, has become quite a household affair in Calcutta. Either because your little one insists that Christmas should be more than just about hanging stockings for Uncle Santa to stuff with gifts or just that its been a childhood habit to celebrate December 25 with lights, cakes and friends around you.

 But then, isnt festive decor an integral part of the whole affair? You bet it is. Loads of colourful streamers, chart paper cutouts, the Santa doll and the Christmas tree... 

 From the decor items on Free School Street that come for anything between Rs 10 and Rs 1,100, to the high-end pieces in the malls touching Rs 3,500, there is variety to suit every pocket in the countdown to Christmas.

 And if you are yet to get your Christmas act together, GoodLife helps you browse through some of the popular haunts.

 Claus choice

 At the row of shops dotting Free School Street, the Santa Claus comes in all sizes ? tiny or medium-sized dolls and even life-sized figures. While the big ones are mostly picked up by the restaurants and hotels, for homes the smaller ones sell well, says Sheikh Nooruddin of Merry Flower, a shop on Free School Street.

 At Landmark, good ol red-clad Santa has company in the form of the more modern ones dressed in royal blue and white, their bright eyes peeping out from gold-rimmed glasses. The fare here is truly wide ? right from the cute little Santas that can hang from bare hooks to large cutouts of beaming Santas holding Merry Xmas boards.

 The one that steals the show, however, is the big sporty Santa climbing a red rope with a brocade gift bag on his shoulder. The other one to watch out for is the Santa with a sensor that sings Jingle Bells and dances each time someone passes by.

 At Pantaloons, the old man dressed in a glittering jacket and red pants sings Santa Claus is coming to town. Westside has a range of red cushions with Santa faces and figures.

 Be it Santa apparels, caps or dolls, the goodies are a rage this season, says Meghna Shroff from the Archies outlet at City Centre. From polyresin figures wearing olive striped pants and black boots, to cute little hanging Santas peeping out from red stockings, the shop is home to a large variety.

 However, it is the big Santa climbing a ladder that is the real show stealer. This is an electrically operated piece where the ladder lights up once the switch is on. Other varieties include the musical water ball Santa and Santa sitting in a basket swing.

 Tree tale

 From the imported artificial ones at Landmark to the shiny tinsel shredded ones at Free School Street, the Christmas tree come in sizes big, medium and small.

 At Landmark you get the tabletop trees that are dense and have a snowflaked effect on the tips. We have a wide variety of Christmas trees that stand out in sheer quality and range. The imported ones are reusable, says Gautam Jatia, CEO of Landmark.

 At Archies, the tree is all about innovation. Tiny Christmas trees placed in woven coffee-coloured baskets are decorated with silver or bronze balls and wreathes. Then you have the snowflaked ones in shades of white and sea green. The electrically-operated ones adorned with stars have tips with changing glows.

 Snow pals

 Living in Calcutta, building a snowman might not be part of your Christmas activity, but you can always get one home from the stores around town.

 The all-white snowman at Landmark is decorated with lots of shine and shimmer. Archies houses a special Snowman series ? hanging ones made of cloth and fur wearing green caps and mufflers, glass fibre ones donning red caps, electrically-operated ones that give out a orange glow once switched on and the battery-operated snowman duo in a combination of mauve and yellow.

 Jingle bells

 A cascading bunch of golden bells hangs from the ceiling right up to a few inches from the floor at Landmark. Also on offer are simple sets of three bells. At Pantaloons, there are bells with carvings and glitter all over, tiny red twin bells tied with ribbons and bigger ones in bright red.

 At Archies again, there are huge bunches of beautifully carved bells, chains of beads along with bells that can be entwined around the Christmas tree and attractive bronze-coloured bells combined with wreathes. They are apt for hanging just above the entrance door, points out Meghna.

 The age-old thermocol cut-out bells and paper ones in combinations of white and pink, white and yellow or white and blue at Merry Flower look nice and bright.

 Decor drama

 Apart from the essential symbols, there are loads and loads of Christmas finery doing the rounds of the racks. A fascinating array of wall hangings and ceiling hangings come attached with reindeers, Santas, trees, bunch of gifts, snowmen, bells, greeting boards and more.

 Then there are tree decorations like frilly streamers, tinsel ribbons, stars, hearts, shimmering balls, small reindeers and angels.

 For tree lighting you can check out the glowing red berries along with leaves at Landmark.

 If these strands are for the tree, light up the rest of the home with candles placed in heart-shaped and star-shaped glittering candleholders in shades of silver and golden from Pantaloons.

 A cute little soft toy penguin dressed in a bright red cap and muffler from Westside could be a suitable companion for your Santa Claus.

 Finally, to get into the Christmas groove, get yourself the Santa doorbell.

 Dress em up

 Readying your home for the revelry is just not enough, as the effect will only be complete when your attire matches the mood. So, caps and stockings are a must in your Christmas garb.

 At Landmark, Santa cap-cum-masks with fluffy white cheeks are paired with red stockings decorated with Xmas embellishments.

 At Archies, the variety of caps and stockings will spoil you for choice. Red caps are embellished with stars that glow when a button is pressed. Leather-finish Santa caps, sequinned stockings, stockings adorned with teddy bears and reindeers are among the other offerings here.

 Pantaloons, too, has a fairly good collection of red caps and stockings with white feathery attachments.

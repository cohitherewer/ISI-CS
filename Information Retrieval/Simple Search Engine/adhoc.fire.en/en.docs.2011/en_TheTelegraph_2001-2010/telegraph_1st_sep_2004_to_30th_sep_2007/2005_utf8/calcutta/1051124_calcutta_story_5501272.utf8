 Dumps add to dog count

 The civic health department and NGOs, that had been allotted the task of controlling the stray dog population, are at loggerheads over the rising canine count in Calcutta.

 A senior official in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) dog squad pointed out that People for Animals and Love-N-Care for Animals had earlier been entrusted with sterilisation of street dogs in the city.

 ?But for the past four months, which coincides with the breeding season for canines, People for Animals has stopped sterilising and vaccinating them. This has resulted in a rise in the puppy count in areas from South Sinthee to Tollygunge,? he said. The CMC had given the NGO charge of wards 1 to 90 and of the Dhapa dog pound.

 ?Beyond Tollygunge, and in Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur, the other NGOs are still active,? said chief municipal health officer (CMOH) Deb Dwipayan Chattopadhyay.

 The NGOs argue that the reason for the increase in the population of street dogs in the city is directly related to the dumping of garbage on the roadsides. ?Hence, more stray dogs is a pointer to the mushrooming of unauthorised dumps,? claimed Sushmita Roy of Love-N-Care.

 Debashish Chakraborty, managing trustee, People for Animals, said: ?As redistribution of work areas among the NGOs by the CMC is pending, it has not been possible for us to proceed with fieldwork for the past couple of months despite requests from residents.? He added that normally, 20 to 40 dogs are lifted every day from various wards of the city. This count sometimes goes up to 80 in the mating season.

 ?In the absence of adequate control measures, the canine count is bound to go up by around 30 per cent,? said Chakraborty, while putting the virile dog figure in the city at about 60,000. In comparison, the total number of dogs sterilised in a year is only 5,000. Roy of Love-N-Care explained how in the absence of sterilisation, two to three bitches and a dog can multiply into 300 dogs in a span of three years.

 The CMOH said four more NGOs will be soon employed for the sterilisation and vaccination of stray dogs. 

 Henceforth, it will also be mandatory for NGOs to allow public inspection of their pounds, he added.

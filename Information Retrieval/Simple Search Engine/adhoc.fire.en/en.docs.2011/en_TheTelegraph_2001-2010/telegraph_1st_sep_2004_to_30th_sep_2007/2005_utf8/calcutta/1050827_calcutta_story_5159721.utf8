The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Toll at nine, scurry to defeat dengue

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The fear of the fever continued to rise in the city, with the government officially raising the dengue death toll to nine and the victim count to 139.

 Alarming blood sample reports from five boroughs, comprising 50 wards, forced the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) to declare them dengue-prone, on Friday. The affected boroughs are II, III, V, VII and X.

 This stretches from Dhakuria and Golf Green in the south to Bagbazar and Nimtala in the north, with several pockets in between.

 The duel with dengue has prompted high-level meetings at both the state health directorate and the CMC on Friday.

 Chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb said: ?Hospitals have been asked to ready infrastructure to fight the disease.?

 At the CMC headquarters, all civic doctors and health workers were assigned dawn-to-dusk duty, from 7 am to 6 pm, to defeat dengue.

 According to a directive from municipal commissioner Debashis Som, besides the health department, officers and workers from the conservancy, drainage and sewerage and building departments would visit the dengue-hit areas.

 While civic health clinics are kept open in the 50 wards from 7 am to 6 pm and intensive fogging is carried out to kill mosquitoes, officers and workers from the other department would carry out the cleaning of surface drains, inspection of construction sites and spraying to destroy mosquito larvae.

 A special fund has also been allotted to repair the fogging machines that are now out of order, as also for the purchase of chemicals and for conduction of regular awareness campaigns to curb the threat of dengue.

 At the moment, of the 100 van-fog machines, 35 are not functional and of 110 swing-fog machines, 47 are not battle-worthy.

 Anti-larvae chemical stock in hand is ? baytex 3,500 litre, solfac Rs 30 lakh of stocks, biocide Rs 10 lakh of stocks and pyrethrum 5,000 litre.

 The manpower engaged in the bid to battle dengue includes an entomologist and over 1,050 civic staff members and 150 contractual workers.

 Meanwhile, the state health directorate has alerted all hospitals to be prepared to combat the disease.

 ?We have directed all state-run hospitals to sent updated reports of possible dengue cases regularly. We are keeping a watch on the situation,? said Jayashri Mitra, state director of medical education.

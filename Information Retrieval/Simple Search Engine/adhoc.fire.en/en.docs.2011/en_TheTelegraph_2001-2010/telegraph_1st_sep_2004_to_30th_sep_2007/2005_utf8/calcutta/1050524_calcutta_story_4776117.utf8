 Landfill with govt soil rakes up furore

 Ignoring a state government diktat, a resident of Rampur, in Mahestala, on the southern part of the city, is allegedly filling up a waterbody spread over nearly five bighas. 

 In the process, he is violating another law by using soil collected from a land belonging to the Calcutta Metropolitan Water and Sanitation Authority (CMW amp;SA), said residents of the area.

 The plot at Paharpur, on one side of the waterbody, has been earmarked for the third phase of the Garden Reach water treatment plant.

 The wastewater of the entire area accumulates in the waterbody. If it is filled up, the area will get submerged even after the slightest shower. 

 ?We can?t understand how the waterbody is being filled up openly. The work has been going on for more than a month now, but the government has not come forward to stop it. Even though the local municipality is aware of the matter, it is turning a blind eye to it,? said Benoy Saha, a resident.

 Owner of the waterbody, Gobinda Naskar, remained defiant in the face of criticism. ?The plot was never a waterbody. Wastewater from the locality and a factory accumulate in it, posing health hazards. Some people with vested interests are trying to describe the plot as a waterbody,? he said.

 Naskar was equally vocal against the allegation that the waterbody is being filled up with soil from a government land. ?We have obtained permission from the relevant authorities and are not doing anything illegal. I have got supporting documents,? he asserted. 

 Chief engineer of the CMW amp;SA R.M. Chatterjee expressed surprise on being questioned about the matter. ?How can the government ask a private party to collect soil from its land to fill up a waterbody?? he asked. Chatterjee added that the agency has filed an FIR with the local police station after receiving complaints from residents. 

 ?We have not only complained to police, but have also sent a copy of the complaint to the chairman of Mahestala municipality,? the chief engineer said.

 The matter has also created a stir among a section of CMW amp;SA employees.

 According to general secretary of the Development Employees Joint Action Committee P.N. Nag, the matter would not have reached this stage if the authorities had taken steps to build the water treatment plant.

 ?They should have at least fenced off the land. Since they didn?t, such things will go on. Ultimately, the agency will be forced to fill up the land with sand, thereby escalating the project cost,? he said.

 Chairman of the municipality Kali Bhandari said that he has received complaints from the local residents and the CMW amp;SA.

 ?I have asked my officers to inquire into the matter and submit a report. After the report is filed, proper action will be taken if any illegality is found,? he said.

 Bhandari added that all the local residents know that the land belongs to CMW amp;SA. According to him, Naskar was violating the laws because he enjoys the patronage of a political party. ?But we won?t allow this to go on. We are just waiting for the report,? he stated.

 District superintendent of police S.N. Gupta said: ?Nobody can fill up a waterbody even if he has the papers. Besides, there is no question of a private party being allowed to collect soil from government land. I have asked my officers to submit a report.?

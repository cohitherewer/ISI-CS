 Weavers Studio, the plush Ballygunge destination for elegant fashion picks, celebrated its 12th anniversary on Wednesday. The occasion was marked by the inauguration of a four-day exhibition of jewellery, textiles and garments. 

 Adding glamour to the do, the exhibition was inaugurated by Bollywood actress Kirron Kher, looking elegant in an off-white salwar suit.

 On offer is handcrafted jewellery by Amrapali Jewellers of Jaipur, an assortment of hand-woven textiles by Amita Gupta, jackets and fabrics by Brigitte Singh, contemporary garments by Sonya Khan and in-house creations.

 Weavers Studio has always been a favourite stop. The variety in textiles, interesting designs and the overall appeal make this store stand out, said Kirron. 

 The show-stealers at the exhibition are the exquisite Tussars, Pashminas, Kanjeevarams and Benarasis. The motifs of the saris draw inspiration from the Mughal era, reflected in the typical butis and the jewel colours, explains store director Darshan Shah.

 Tribal cottons from Bengal and Orrisa also catch the eye. The saris start from Rs 3,500.

 The jewellery section includes antique silver pieces studded with semi-precious stones, gold combined with precious gems, tribal pendants dangling from black chords, chandelier earrings, Jaipuri wristlets and more.

 Though the motifs are on traditional lines, the jewellery looks very modern and is highly wearable, says Anil Ajmera of Amrapali. 

 The silver jewellery is priced between Rs 100 and Rs 12,000 and the gold pieces start at Rs 4,000.

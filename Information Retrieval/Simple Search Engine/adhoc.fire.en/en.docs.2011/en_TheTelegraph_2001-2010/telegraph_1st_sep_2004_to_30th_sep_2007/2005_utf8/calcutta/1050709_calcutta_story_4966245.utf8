 The college has more illustrious names among its alumni than space on its walls to write them all down. Despite being strewn around the world, there are alumni associations aplenty. Although the Calcutta chapter of St Stephen?s College, Delhi, was set up decades ago, it fizzled out as the members moved away.

 But a few die-hards are still fighting for its survival. Satish Dhall, of Hindustan Lever Ltd, passed out of the college in the 1960s, and signed up with the alumni association in Calcutta. 

 ?We had a few events over the years, but interest faded. Now, we are going to revive the effort and do it in a big way,? he says.

 Beginning with a gala all-day event on July 10. The morning will see a golf tournament, named the Bose Saab Memorial Trophy ? ?Prof Bose was a much-loved person, so we?re naming it after him? ? followed by the prize distribution and lunch. Then, there will be a special meal and donation of fans to the elderly inmates of the Little Sisters of the Poor old-age home on AJC Bose Road. 

 In the evening, it?s a cocktail and dinner at Raj Bhavan. ?The Governor was a contemporary of mine at St Stephen?s. He was an English honours student, I was history honours. We were more sporty and mischievous, he was an intellectual,? recalls Dhall. 

 One aim of the newly-revived association is to raise funds for the college, to renovate and refurbish it. Also in the works is a directory of Calcutta?s Stephanites.

 ?There are over 100 Stephanites in Calcutta, including the oldest, A.C. Chatterjee of the class of ?41, who we will be honouring. The youngest is a 2005 graduate. At the event, we are expecting some famous Calcuttans to turn up, like Arun Lal and Konkona Sen Sharma. There will also be three representatives from the college, including principal Anil Wilson. After we put the ad in the paper, even Stephanites from Bangladesh contacted us, wanting to be here for the reunion,? says Dhall.

 ?This time, we will not let the association die. We will have regular meetings. Let?s see what we can do,? he signs off.

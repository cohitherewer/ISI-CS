 Recast roster at hospitals

 - MCI assessment visit prompts spruce up of state-run facilities 

 KINSUK BASU

 Corridors crammed with patients, paint peeling off the walls and students waiting for teachers ? a familiar sight at state-run teaching hospitals, that is about to see some improvement, thanks to the Medical Council of India (MCI). 

 With an MCI assessment team scheduled to visit the five teaching hospitals in the city soon ? after a gap of almost nine years ? the health department heads have chalked out a three-phase revamp plan.

 It aims to plug loopholes and put in place a system that meets the criteria for an MCI certificate. 

 To begin with, pipeline oxygen will be introduced in all the five hospitals. The facility will later be made available at state-run hospitals in the districts.

 The state government has already tied up with two companies for laying out the pipelines. The work is set to begin at the hospitals next week.

 In the second phase, the emergency department of the teaching hospitals will be done up. The toilets will be cleaned, rooms will be properly lit, departments will be provided with at least a computer each and the staff will be trained to handle patients better.

 The final phase will see recruitment of teachers and other staff and purchase of equipment for the college laboratories.

 The health officials have been asked to assign top priority to the project and complete the work within the next few days. The MCI team will make its first stop at Sanmilani Medical College, in Bankura. They will complete the assessment between December 5 and December 7. 

 ?In keeping with MCI stipulations, we have initiated certain steps aimed at serving the patients better. Installing pipeline oxygen is just one of them,? said Jayshree Mitra, director of medical education.

 She added: ?The best part of the pipeline project is that hospitals will save money by preventing wastage and cutting down on problems relating to procurement and refilling of cylinders. Besides, the hospitals will not run out of oxygen supply from time to time.?

 The two oxygen suppliers have been assigned specific jobs. The hospitals have been asked to identify a place to set up the central unit. From this unit, oxygen will be distributed to different departments through the pipelines.

 Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital has been allotted Rs 15 lakh for the pipeline project. Laying of pipes is to begin next week.

 ?The work will then be taken up at RG Kar Medical College, NRS Medical College and SSKM and finally, Medical College and Hospital. Besides, Rs 27 lakh has been sanctioned to Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital for purchase of equipment,? said a state finance department officer. 

 Besides pipeline oxygen and mechanised laundries, the thrust of recast would be on recruiting teachers for the medical colleges. 

 Decks have been cleared for the recruitment of 43 teachers and a librarian each at all the state-run teaching hospitals in Bengal.

 The West Bengal Public Service Commission will fill the vacant teaching posts. The librarians will be recruited on one-year contracts.

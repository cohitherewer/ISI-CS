The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Green cases stay buried in court lists

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 Cases relating to auto emission, contamination of the Lakes and of drinking water in schools and hospitals and traffic congestion at 51 important intersections are of genuine concern for the city, but are off the list at Calcutta High Court. 

 No one has an inkling when they will be heard again.

 Tired of waiting, only to see important cases relating to environment pollution in Calcutta and elsewhere being dropped, green activists have pleaded for immediate intervention of Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurker. 

 ?As many as 13 cases, all related to environmental issues, have been pending with the high court for years,? said activist Subhas Dutta.

 ?The cases are either listed so low down the order that it becomes impossible for a judge to hear them or off the list for months. Therefore, we decided to appeal to the Chief Justice, seeking his intervention,? he added.

 In 2001, the green activists, headed by Dutta of the Ganatantrik Nagarik Samity, had filed a case in the high court with special emphasis on the poor state of drinking water in hospitals, schools, colleges and universities.

 After numerous hearings, the court, on October 16, 2004, had ordered the State Planning Board to chalk out an action plan for the supply of portable drinking water. 

 The matter then went off the list. ?It needs to be heard urgently, because there are several other aspects related to issues of grave concern,? Dutta has written to Chief Justice Sirpurker. 

 Auto emission, causing environmental pollution and diseases like cancer, is one of the several issues that has failed to make it to the hearing list. 

 The last order in the case was issued on December 15, 2004, when the oil companies and the state were ordered to inform the court about measures taken to save Calcuttans from pollution.

 For the past three months, the matter has not been heard. 

 A case was filed in the high court in 1997, seeking measures to stop pollution of the Rabindra Sarobar waters and clear the area of encroachers. The case was last heard on December 9, 2004. 

 Though several pending issues on environment are related to the case, it has not been heard since.

 Similar is the fate of a case relating to traffic congestions in the city, causing an annual manhour loss of Rs 6,000 crore. It has not come up for hearing since April 2004. 

 Dutta cited another petition, filed on February 28, 2005, which had pleaded for measures against the entry of around 1,000 goods-laden vehicles into the city at night without any pollution check. 

 Listed as item number 52, Dutta feels the plea is unlikely to be heard within the next six months. 

 Altogether 39 municipalities in and around the city have been asked to appear before the court in a case related to pollution in the Hooghly. But it has not been heard since September 2004. 

 ?We have no idea when it will finally come up for hearing,? Dutta lamented.

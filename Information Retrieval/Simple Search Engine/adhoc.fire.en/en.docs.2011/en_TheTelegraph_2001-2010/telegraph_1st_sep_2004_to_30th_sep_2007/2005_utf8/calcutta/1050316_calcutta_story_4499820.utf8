The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Tanusree Shankar 

You are hungry for knowledge. You are a diligent worker. You are scared of being alone; it?s easy for you to over-spend or be overly accommodating to co-workers. It is important that you learn to stand alone and secure in your independence. You are an affectionate and considerate friend. You are dutiful, and rarely get carried away by your emotions. ? Kusum Bhandari

Richard Gere: Beyond Chicago 

 Remember the fancy footwork, the melodious voice, the raw energy shining in the spotlight in Chicago? Or perhaps your personal favourite is the confused and angry young man with the charming smile in An Officer And A Gentleman. But surely you?ll agree that by the time Pretty Woman hit the screen, the pretty boy struggling to make a mark in Hollywood had morphed into a stylish actor, with versatility as his hallmark. Well, ladies and gentlemen, Richard Gere is here again.

 The silver-haired star is back on the big screen in Shall We Dance, co-starring Jennifer Lopez.

 He?s a multifaceted man of many talents, and with looks to die for. The Philadelphia-born and New York-raised actor was almost the loveable bad boy of Hollywood through the 1980s, maturing into a man of considerable substance, winning box-office success and critical acclaim ? although the two were mutually exclusive ? in the 90s. 

 The 55-year-old has also used his celebrity status to fight for causes, from Tibet to HIV/AIDS. The devout Buddhist has made many a trip to Dharamshala, to meet the Dalai Lama and lend his support to the Tibetan people. Then, he wowed India on his recent trip to Delhi, to spread awareness of the dreaded disease that is AIDS, through the Richard Gere Foundation. 

 In Shall We Dance, Gere plays a family man besotted by a beautiful but lonely dancer. John Clark, a regular guy in Chicago, falls for a woman on the train he sees everyday. He gets off the train on an impulse one night, and signs up for dance classes. So begins his clandestine wooing of Paulina (J.Lo), who is initially more icy than warm. The friendship develops, while it all remains a secret from everyone John knows. 

 Will he win Chicago?s biggest dance competition? Will his wife find out? Will he end up with his shadowy love? To find out more, watch the film, now playing in the city halls.

 Susan Sarandon puts in a stellar performance as his wife in the English version of an originally Japanese film. While J.Lo is an accomplished dancer, Gere spent months learning the steps. And, he says, he loved every minute of it.

Anusha in the item number in Mumbai Matinee: Colourful

 Several serials on Zee Television would be Holi-flavoured on the day. The special Holi episodes weave the festival into the plot. In Astitva ? Ek Prem Kahani, Sonu and Aastha and others dance and have a good time on Holi while in Kareena Kareena, the heroine plays Holi with Tushar and Prem, who arrive in disguise.

 In Pancham, Radhika is eager to play Holi with Pancham, who gets defeated in a Doha competition. Finally, in Piya Ka Ghar, the festival is celebrated at Megha?s house, but Megha gets jealous seeing Isha and Garv playing Holi together.

 It?s also an all-colour Holi on STAR Movies. The celebrations on the channel will feature films with English titles but with that all-important Indian touch. Called ?crossover? by some and Hinglish by others, these films have certainly dared to think different from the routine box-office fare. 

 So on Friday, from early in the morning till late into the evening, it?s all desi on STAR Movies. It kicks off with the Om Puri-starrer Mystic Masseur at 7.40 am, then moves on to American Born Confused Desi at 11.50 am, Rahul Bose and Perizaad Zorabian take over at 1.50 pm with Mumbai Matinee and finally, it?s the musical laugh riot Jhankaar Beats, at 6.20 pm.

Michael Parkinson: Chit chat

 Michael Parkinson is no ordinary journalist. He has written countless books, worked in radio, print and television, started several shows and columns and, it is said, has interviewed over a thousand of the world?s most famous and influential people in the fields of sports, cinema, entertainment, art and literature. 

 And Parkinson has finally come calling in Calcutta. At least on the small screen. Catch Parkinson, the show that had a viewership of millions each week on BBC and is now back again on British cable TV, on Sundays at 7.30 pm on STAR World.

 The series features a veritable galaxy of stars on air, in a candid chat with the 70-year-old, three celebrities per episode. Tom Cruise to Samuel L. Jackson, Kevin Spacey to Renee Zellweger, Ewan McGregor, Sandra Bullock, Will Smith, Julie Walters, Twiggy, Bruce Willis, Bob Geldof, Rod Stewart, Dame Judi Dench?

 If you?ve missed the starters, then tune in before the feast is over.

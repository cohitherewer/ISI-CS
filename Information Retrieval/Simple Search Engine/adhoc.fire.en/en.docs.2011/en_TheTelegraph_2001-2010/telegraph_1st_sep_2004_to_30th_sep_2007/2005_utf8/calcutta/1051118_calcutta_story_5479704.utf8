 Sizzling soup spread 

 RIDDHIMA SEAL

 As the evening Celsius begins to dip, what better way to keep you warm than sipping on some hot soup? So, the Oriental Hot Pots Festival at Pan Asian in ITC Sonar Bangla comes at just the right time.

 Presenting Hot Pots the traditional way , the stock is spiked with spices like Kafir Lime, Lemon Grass and Galangal.

 The health conscious can savour the Vegetarian Hot Pots made up of mushrooms of all sorts and vegetables like broccoli, pakchoy, runner beans, asparagus and carrots.

 For non-vegetarians, there is quite an array to choose from. While seafood lovers could go for variations with squids, bekti, tuna and octopus, others can go for the more simple combinations of chicken, lamb or pork.

 Says chef Pramod: Easy to stir up and healthy too, Hot Pots is also an example of live cooking as there is a burner under the table. The food continues to be heated as long as you have it. And you can fish out ingredients from the stock according to your choice with specially-made strainers.

 If the non-vegetarian stock comes for Rs 2,300-plus for two, the vegetarian variety costs Rs 1,900-plus. 

 The festival is on for lunch on weekends and dinner on all days till November 23.

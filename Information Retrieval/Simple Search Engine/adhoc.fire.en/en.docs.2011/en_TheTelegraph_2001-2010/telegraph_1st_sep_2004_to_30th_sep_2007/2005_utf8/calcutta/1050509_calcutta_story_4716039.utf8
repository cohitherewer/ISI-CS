The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 No Hrithik or Penn, welcome Ajay the child 

 Having shot for Yuva and Raincoat in the city, AJAY DEVGAN returned to Calcutta with co-star ESHA DEOL and director HARRY BAWEJA for a promotional tour of their new film Main Aisa Hi Hoon. The team spoke to Pratim D. Gupta about the musical adaptation of I Am Sam

 He?s got a stronger Calcutta connection than most other Bollywood stars, what with his last two major films having been shot here. But when Ajay Devgan breezed through town on Friday evening, he was neither Yuva?s Michael nor Raincoat?s Manoj. He was Main Aisa Hi Hoon?s Indraneel Thakur, ?a grown-up man with the brain of a seven-year-old?.

 Looking leaner than ever before, Ajay was ready to duck, hook or pull any bouncer about his character?s similarities with that of Hrithik Roshan in Koi? Mil Gaya. ?The two films are completely different and so are the characters. Once you watch the film you would know that there can be no comparisons between the two films.?

 But neither Ajay nor producer-director Harry Baweja denies the fact that Main Aisa Hi Hoon does take off from the Sean Penn-Michelle Pfeiffer Oscar-winner I Am Sam. ?We have just taken the basic idea from the Hollywood film,? said Baweja. Ajay seconded his director: ?I Am Sam had just three emotional scenes but we have a lot more, here. Most importantly, they don?t have the songs. So that makes the two films totally different. As for comparisons with Sean Penn, well, he is a great actor. I have tried to do the role my way.?

 This is not the first time Baweja and Ajay are working together. ?No film of mine is complete without Ajay,? smiled Baweja, who?s directed the National Award-winner in Dilwale, Diljale and Qayamat. Earlier titled Dil Mera Todo Na, Main Aisa Hi Hoon, released on Friday, also stars Esha Deol as Ajay?s estranged love interest and Sushmita Sen as his lawyer, who helps Ajay keep his daughter.

 ?I had put on weight for my role in the film,? recalled Ajay. ?Playing a character of a child-inside-a-man was very difficult initially. I had to be conscious all the time of whether it was looking right but then things settled down. For a role like this, there is a very thin line between going overboard and playing the role well.?

 Main Aisa Hi Hoon also marks the third on-screen collaboration between Ajay and Esha. ?First was Yuva. Then we did Kaal and now, this film,? said Esha. ?Throughout, I have respected him a lot. I have always felt, with him, I am not acting ? I am just reacting. As a member of the audience watching his movies, I keep adoring Ajay?s eyes. I don?t think any hero can express so much with his eyes.? 

 About her character of Maya in the film who?s a lot less glamourous than those of Dhoom and Kaal, Esha said: ?You can?t really categorise a role into glamour and performance. My character in Main Aisa Hi Hoon has a bit of both ? glamour and performance. Then again, I don?t think the character is such that she would get up in the morning and start thinking what to wear for the day.?

 Having worked with everyone from Prakash Jha to David Dhawan, Ajay said he doesn?t choose films on the basis of makers or genres. ?It?s very instinctive. If I like a script, I do it. It?s not that I try to balance mainstream and arty films.?

 Speaking of his other release running at the theatres, Kaal, Ajay said: ?We had a great time shooting for the film. I don?t think the Supreme Court stay order should be a long-lasting problem since we shot only in the permitted areas and we never shot with the animals.?

 What?s up next? ?There?s Prakashji?s Apaharan,? says Ajay. ?Then, I have films with John Matthew Mathan and Raj Kumar Santoshi. Recently, I did an advertisement with Kajol for a washing machine. It was nice but we aren?t planning any film project together, as of now. As far as returning to production goes, nothing?s finalised but I have liked a script and that?s being worked upon.?

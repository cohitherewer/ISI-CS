The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Three men, many lives 

 June stars in Teen Yaari Katha

 With three best friends, their dreams and aspirations as the storyline, Teen Yaari Katha could be Tollywood?s take on Dil Chahta Hai. But that?s where the similarity begins and ends. Far from the slick urban look and life on the fast track, Teen Yaari Katha zeroes in on the lives of three middle-class Bengali youths, saddled by their financial state, yet hoping to make it big one day.

 To roll out on the Technicians I floors from September 12, the film marks the entry of Sahara One Motion Pictures into Bengali films. Ideas, the event management company steered by Prosenjit, will act as executive producer for the film.

 ?There has been a shift in today?s youths ? from their interest in politics to career. These three boys are not just aimless, they are good souls too. It?s something like Tapan Sinha?s Apanjan, which was also a youth film. We wanted to do something youthful, fun and contemporary. But there?s black humour in it too,? says Sudeshna Roy, who will co-direct the film with Abhijit Guha. Teen Yaari Katha will be the duo?s second feature film after the Prosenjit-Koel Mullick starrer Shudhu Tumi last year.

 The film also brings a host of popular television faces to celluloid ? Parambrata Chatterjee, Neel Mukherjee, Rudranil Ghosh, June, Saswata Chatterjee, Gargi Roy Chowdhury and Rimjhim Mitra. Among seniors there are Biplab Chatterjee and Gita De.

 Set in the suburbs of Calcutta, rather ?greater Calcutta?, Teen Yaari Katha will focus on the feelings of the Bengali pushed to the fringes. One of them is an auto-driver (Rudranil), the second a newspaper hawker (Neel) and the third a graduate looking for a job (Parambrata).

 The three friends are not without their love interests ? Rudranil is a Prosenjit fan who dreams of marrying his boss?s daughter (Rimjhim), Neel admires a neighbourhood girl and Parambrata has a crush on a woman involved in theatre.

 ?But all three are interested in their next-door boudi, June, who lives as a tenant with her husband (Saswata). They may fantasise about her but deep down they are good souls. They will be the first to step in when someone?s in a crisis. This is the quintessential Bengali boy that we want to catch,? says Roy. ?It?s an urban and semi-urban film and hopes to touch a mixed crowd.?

 The script has been penned by Anindya Bose, songwriter and musician of Bangla band Sahar, while Bhoomi has scored the music.

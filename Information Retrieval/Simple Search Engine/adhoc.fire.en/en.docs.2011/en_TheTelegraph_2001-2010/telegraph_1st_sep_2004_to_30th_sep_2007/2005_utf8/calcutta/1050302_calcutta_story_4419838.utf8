 Anil Ambani in the run-up to the Mumbai marathon

 It took an Anil Ambani, an Amitabh Bachchan and a host of serious runners to make the Mumbai marathon Asia?s biggest roadshow. Two months on, it is time for Calcutta to strap on its running shoes, with maybe one of the big As turning up to lead the marathon march.

 The city?s ?first real marathon? ? all 42.195 km of it ? will be flagged off from Red Road early on March 13. Being billed as the next big thing after the Mumbai run, the CII-led Kolkata Marathon, backed by Airtel and The Telegraph, promises to engage ?around 200 serious runners?, comprising athletes and army and police personnel.

 What about star power? If the organisers have their way, one of the participants warming up at 6.30 am on Sunday will be Anil Ambani. ?We have written to him, requesting him to participate,? said Prochy Mehta, chief organising secretary of the marathon.

 Ambani or no Ambani, there will be a fair sprinkling of local stardust. Sourav Ganguly and some of his boys in blue might drop in, first Pakistan Test permitting. Footballers yesterday (sheriff Chuni Goswami and others) and today (the Bhaichung Bhutias) will be there, along with top cop Prasun Mukherjee and several Tollywood celebrities.

 According to the Athletic Coaches Association of Bengal, the full marathon for the male athlete will circle the city while a 10.2-km mini marathon will see the serious women contestants sweating it out. Those eyeing something even less taxing can try the 4.2-km ?fun run?, open to everyone.

 The main run will start and finish at the Basketball Grounds on Red Road. Moving from CR Avenue, it will touch Salt Lake, EM Bypass, Park Street, Sarat Bose Road, Chetla, Majherhat, Diamond Harbour Road and Strand Road.

 The entry fee ? Rs 25 for adults and Rs 10 for students ? will allow participants to aim for awards worth Rs 6.25 lakh, including the prized pot of Rs 2 lakh for the champion male runner and Rs 50,000 for the top female contestant. Funds collected from the marathon will be used primarily for ?the development of the city? and also for improvement of the ?athletic scenario in Bengal?.

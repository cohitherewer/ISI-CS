 Kids prey to adult strain of diabetes

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 The World Health Organisation predicts that the number of diabetics in India will rise by 195 per cent by 2025, but the Indian Diabetic Association is more concerned over the spread of Type 2 diabetes among children in Calcutta.

 Type 2 diabetes, which makes the body resistant to insulin, used to be diagnosed only in adults till a few years ago. But now, an increasing number of children and teenagers are being affected by it. 

 ?Over the years, only the Type 1 variety ? an auto-immune infection in the insulin-producing beta cells ? could be seen among children, requiring them to take insulin. But in the past year-and-a-half, more and more children are reporting with Type 2,? said Subhankar Choudhury, head of the endocrinology department at SSKM Hospital.

 Agreed Sudip Chatterjee, endocrinologist with Park Clinic and Hospital: ?Till 2000, I had not seen a single Type 2 case in the city among children. Now, an increasing number of them are coming to us with diabetes patterns once associated only with adults.?

 Experts attribute the phenomenon to the rise in the consumption of aerated drinks and junk food. Studies show the sale of cold drinks and fried food has increased by almost 60 per cent over the past two years or so.

 According to a moderate estimate, Type 2 diabetes among children has risen by almost 100 per cent over the past seven years ? in fact, the rise has been as high as 70 per cent over the past two-three years. 

 Figures from hospitals indicate that of every 100 childhood diabetes cases, at least 65-70 are of the Type 2 variety.

 Doctors suggest a strict diet to avoid the disease, including restrictions on highly-refined carbohydrates (such as sugar and sweets), high fat and high-saturated fat food (like butter, ghee, cream and fried foods). 

 ?Unless someone strictly restricts food habits, diabetes can take a serious turn,? warned Stephen A. Smith, director (scientific affairs) of pharma major Glaxosmithkline.

 Pressed with the problem, the Bengal chapter of the Diabetic Association of India has decided to organise a convention on diabetes among school-going children on July 30. 

 ?We have invited school principals to attend the convention. The schools need to counsel parents and children regularly,? declared Subhankar Choudhury, vice-president of the association.

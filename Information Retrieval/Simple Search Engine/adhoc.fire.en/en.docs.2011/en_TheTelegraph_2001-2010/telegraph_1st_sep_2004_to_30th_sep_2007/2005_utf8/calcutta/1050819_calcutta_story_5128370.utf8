 Jetstar Asia aims to make air travel more accessible

 The airline was launched less than a year ago, in December 2004. On August 18, 2005, Jetstar Asia?s first flight from Singapore to Calcutta arrived at Dum Dum airport. 

 With fifty per cent bookings on the inaugural flight, the only international low-cost carrier to fly out of India is already planning daily flights from the city.

 For now, the airline, a partnership between Australian carrier Qantas and Singapore Airlines, will operate on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays. It will leave Calcutta at 7 pm, and depart from Singapore at 4.30 pm. 

 ?Our eventual target is a daily flight. The traffic flow has been increasing and in the coming days, we will check out the economic viability closely before the final decision,? said Ken Ryan, chief executive officer of the Singapore-based airline. ?We are not looking to draw away passengers from other airlines. We want to grow the market, by making air travel more accessible.?

 Ankur Bhatia, executive director of Bird Group, overlooking the operation of the airline in the country, is sure of growth in the number of passengers. ?Air travel in Calcutta expanded by 33 per cent in 2004-2005, against 20 per cent in the rest of the country. In the first six months of this year, it?s in the region of 30 per cent. So, the potential market is there, enough to support a Jetstar daily flight even with four weekly Singapore Airlines flights, as well as an Indian Airlines service. Once we become daily here, we can expand to other destinations in the country. Talks are on between the Singapore and Indian governments. We are hopeful,? he added.

 Statistics provided by the Singapore Tourism Board officials revealed that trade between Singapore and eastern India had nearly doubled in the past decade and is still rising. 

 ?In 1995, the total business transaction between these two cities was $3.9 billion but in the past year, the figure touched nearly $7.6 billion,? an official added. 

 On the tourism front, too, the going is ?great?, with around 16,000 Calcuttans visiting Singapore. ?The city is among the top five in India contributing to Indian arrivals in our country,? said K.S. Kheng, director of Singapore Tourism Board. ?We are planning a promotion, too, next month in India, around the launch of Jetstar Asia.?

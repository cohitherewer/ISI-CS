 Young designer Abhishek Dutta, known for his leather-trimmed bridal lehngas, has been dabbling with men?s wear for the past year. And the ?tremendous response? to his line has prompted Dutta to concentrate on men?s wardrobes for now.

 ?I have been designing for women ever since I started and already have quite a sizeable clientele. Last year, I decided to venture into men?s wear and the response has been immense. So this year I?m planning to concentrate more on this segment,? said the stylist, while launching his summer line for men.

 This lounge wear line boasts shirts, kurtis and tees, which, according to Dutta, have a ?Bollywood feel?. 

 ?The collection is very filmi. It comprises see-through shirts and short kurtis, the kind of clothes that you would find Bollywood heroes wearing. It?s also very metrosexual, the styling is very flamboyant. I have placed more emphasis on the cuts this time,? revealed the designer.

 Surface ornamentation like threadwork, patchwork, faded prints and textured denims embellish the georgette, linen, lycra and cotton garments.

 Pastels like sky blue, sea green, light lilac and dirty pinks, combined with liberal amounts of white, dominate the palette.

 ?Denim has been used innovatively to embellish the outfits. I have specially treated the fabric with enzyme washes to give them a permanent crinkled look,? adds Dutta.

 Priced between Rs 1,500 and Rs 3,500, the collection is available in CIMA Design at Forum.

 Grain of apple

 If you want to keep the doctor away, park yourself at Grain of Salt. The three-year-old eatery on 22 Camac Street is hosting an apple fest where Indian recipes are flavoured with Washington apples.

 Rustled up by celebrity cook Sanjeev Kapoor, the feast kicks off with Seb ka Panna or Masala Apple Juice. After cooling off thus, one can proceed to the main course comprising Seb Murg Puglia (green apples cooked in a rich nut gravy), Navratan Korma and Chatpata Seb Aloo.

 To cap it off there is Shahi Seb Ki Mohren (apple-flavoured rabri). 

 ?This is the first time that a fruit-centric food festival has been conceptualised. This should especially appeal to health conscious food connoisseurs,? said Kapoor. 

 Washington apples have been chosen for the festival as they are easily available in the city round the year and come in attractive colours. One can even purchase the fruits from vendors displaying them on wooden carts at the eatery. 

 ?Fitness and health are top priority with people these days. And apples being highly nutritional, are a must-have. The good thing about these apples is that they are available any time of the year. Besides, these taste better than their Indian counterparts,? said Nitin Kohli, director, Grain of Salt. 

 Games and prizes such as Tol Mol Ke Bol (guess the weight of the apple) and scratch cards with surprise prizes (like for a person dressed in apple colours), add to the fruity fun.

 Customer king

 Customised cooking is the new mantra in Saffron, at The Park. The concept, titled Chef?s Table, involves chef Rajiv Khullar whipping up an exclusive menu keeping in mind the whims and fancies of a patron.

 Khullar will decide on the menu after a consultation with the diner. The parameters to be taken into account are cooking preferences and the right ingredients. The emphasis, however, is largely on vegetarian food, fuelled by rising demand in the category. 

 Ingredients, spices and culinary styles have been drawn from various parts of the country and improvised upon. For example, mustard seed, a typically Bengali ingredient and usually cooked with Bekti or Hilsa, has been used with prawns instead, to make Sorshe Jhinga. Similarly, the Gucchi Cheese Chettinad, where authentic Chettinad spices such as anarsipalam, kalpasi, mogu and tipli have been combined with Kashmiri ingredients. 

 ?What characterises the dishes is flexibility where a particular ingredient can be used in a variety of ways,? explained chef Khullar.

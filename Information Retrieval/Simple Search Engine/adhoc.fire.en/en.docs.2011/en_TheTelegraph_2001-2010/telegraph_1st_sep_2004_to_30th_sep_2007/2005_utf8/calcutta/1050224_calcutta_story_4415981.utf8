 Roma Jhawar did not think twice before pointing her finger at Gunjan Ghosh, prime accused in her kidnap case. 

 ?He is the person who was in the off-white Maruti van. He took me to the house in Sodepur,? she said in the presence of a judicial magistrate, standing in an open courtyard of Dum Dum jail.

 Three dozen convicts and undertrials were also lined up for the test identification parade on Wednesday. 

 Roma easily identified two others, Munna and Bikash Saha, but failed to point out the fourth, Guddu. They were lined up in the courtyard along with 40 other prisoners not involved in the abduction.

 Roma was taken to the field on the jail premises at 1.30 pm. One by one, she pointed her finger at Bikash, Gunjan and Munna and identified them in the presence of Bipasha Mondal, magistrate of the Salt Lake sub-divisional judicial magistrate?s court. But even after repeatedly inspecting him, she failed to identify Guddu.

 Around 12.50 pm, Roma, in a blue salwar-kameez with a red-and-yellow dupatta, arrived at the jail in a silver Hyundai Accent with a police jeep escorting the car. An empty black Accent tailed the convoy. Along with her were brother Rajesh and his wife Sunita. 

 Roma, Rajesh and Sunita were first taken to a room close to the office of the jail superintendent and asked to wait for the magistrate, who arrived around 1 pm.

 The accused were then brought to the courtyard along with other prisoners, similar in build and height, to make the identification process fair.

 Roma was called for the identification parade around 1.30 pm. After a quick look, Roma identified Bikash. She then turned to Gunjan and identified him. After a few minutes and a closer look, Roma pointed to Munna as one of her abductors.

 When told that another kidnapper was yet to be identified, Roma peered at the prisoners for a full 15 minutes but failed to identify Guddu. 

 ?Sorry, I cannot identify any other abductor among these people,? she said. 

 Around 2.25 pm, Roma left the jail with her brother and sister-in-law. 

 An officer said Roma had failed to identify him because she had seen Guddu only at night. ?Guddu was not present at the abduction. He was guarding Roma, sitting in the front seat of the taxi. She was asked to lie on the rear seat on the night of February 4. So, she could not see his face properly,? said the officer.

 While spas have become a common upmarket option, its time for a player to pamper the middle market.

 An economical entrant into the fledgling industry is coming up off the Gariahat Bypass connector near Delhi Public School in the form of Ripples, a fusion spa. It promises to marry ancient Ayurveda with modern techniques and technology under one roof.

 The aim is to provide a comprehensive healthcare and beauty awareness centre that is economically viable for the middle-income group, said a spokesman for the new venture.

 Facilities include steam, sauna, Jacuzzi and a variety of massages, including Thai massage and Chinese reflexology. There will be a special skin care section specialising in acne treatment, dermabrasion and anti-ageing solutions.

 Hair care, eye treatments, general salon services like styling and make-up guidance and a multigym with the latest equipment complete the Ripples experience. 

 An annual membership here comes at Rs 7,000. A hair cut costs between Rs 100 and Rs 225, colouring is priced between Rs 500 and Rs 2,500, massages like reflexology come at Rs 650, while skin treatments such as dermabrasion cost Rs 700.

 Food stop

 If you live in Salt Lake and love to eat pasta, you now have a budget destination to head for. The Food Station, a cosy 12-seater eatery in HA block, opened its kitchen last week. 

 Set up by a group of chefs (one of whom has to his credit the confectionery chain Cakes), the tiny but vibrant stop will dish out pasta, sandwiches and parathas for those on the look out for a quick bite.

 We have started off with a limited menu because of space constraints and also to check out the market buzz, says Shantanu Guhathakurta, one of the men behind the bright outlet in hues of red and orange.

 If space is a constraint, the tasty food makes up for it. The sumptuous Keema Paratha, priced at Rs 50, should prove to be a major draw here besides the delectable pasta selection. The range of desserts, including mango ice cream, could be a great way to beat the Salt Lake summer swelter.

 Ethnic edge

 She was a teacher of art and craft in a Calcutta school till about eight years ago, when her creative flair lured her into the world of fashion design.

 The self-taught Suman Agarwal has been able to create a niche for herself in designer outfit markets across the country including Hyderabad, Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Jaipur where she supplies to some well-known boutiques for ethnic wear.

 Sumans Sarat Bose Road store ? from where she retails under her eponymous label ? speaks volumes about her distinct style.

 My forte is kantha and I use it as the base for all my outfits, explains the designer. She uses subtle shades of white, ivory and beige as the primary colours in her outfits, adding the bright splash with intricate embroidery. 

 From zardosi to metal work, sequins to thread embellishments, the elements combine to create a vibrant look. Specialising in ethnic wear that includes salwar-kurtas and saris with a few bridal lehngas thrown in, Suman favours linen and cotton for summer.

Sleuths sew up early chargesheet

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) will file a chargesheet on Thursday against nine accused held in connection with Roma Jhawar?s abduction.

 The sleuths claimed they had finished the probe and collected all evidence much before the deadline for filing the chargesheet.

 No charges will be framed against three of the accused arrested during the probe. ?We have not found any evidence against Dilip Baidya, who was present at the Sodepur house where Roma was kept confined, and key accused Gunjan Ghosh?s parents, Ashoke Pradip and Krishna Mitra. Three other accused are still on the run,? a senior CID officer said on Wednesday.

 Roma was abducted at gun-point from CA island, about 50 metres from her residence in Salt Lake, while she was on her way to college in a car around 8.30 am on February 4. 

 She returned the next day, at dawn, after her relatives paid a ransom of Rs 20 lakh to the abductors. Within 24 hours, Gunjan fell into the CID net. The other arrests followed within days. Altogether, 12 persons were rounded up and Rs 19.31 lakh was recovered from them.

 Sleuths said Roma and the maternal aunt of Dilip Baidya, Sandhya Das, will be the key witnesses. ?Gunjan first approached Sandhya at her Sodepur residence and told her that he would spend the day there. He introduced Roma as his girlfriend,? said an officer.

 ?The merit of the case will not be diluted even if Roma and Sandhya fail to turn up. Both had recorded their statements in front of a judicial magistrate,? he added.

 The chargesheet will detail how part of the ransom money was spent. ?Gunjan had bought a cellphone, worth Rs 15,000, for his wife. It has been seized,? said the officer.

 Apart from Gunjan, his parents and Dilip, those arrested are ? Sukumar Mondal (the Jhawars? driver), Dasarath Yadav (security guard of the Jhawars? apartment), Damodar Yadav (a neighbour?s driver), Ram Chandra Singh, Munna, Bikash, Mukesh and Guddu.

 Elaborating on the decision to absolve Dilip and Gunjan?s parents of the charges, an officer said: ?Gunjan was a friend of Dilip?s estranged wife and he used this connection. Dilip had no idea about the abduction... As for Gunjan?s parents, they kept a major part of the money, but had no clue where it came from. But, surely, they should have informed police about it.?

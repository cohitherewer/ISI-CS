 Professor of English, Jadavpur University

 Any student has the freedom to stay away from classes or not sit for exams. By doing so, they are damaging nobody but themselves. But if they resort to violent or destructive activities, then it becomes a different matter. Because they are students, they hold a moral ground. But if they want some special consideration, it behoves that they too act in a responsible manner. Academic life in West Bengal has suffered for 10 to 15 years due to violence and counterviolence. Do we want a return to those days? Coming to the situation in Jadavpur University, I do not condone or deny the police action on students. But any solution that is worked out should take into account the total course of events since November 2003. The future working and academic development of the university should not be affected. I have heard of a code of conduct being proposed for new entrants. Assuming that it draws on general norms of civilised conduct, there is no harm in it.

 The legacy of confusion

 Introspection can never replace training in techniques at art schools. We should not overlook our own past and borrow ideas from the West only because it is fashionable to do so, or because it sells. We should learn to dissect works of art and be critical about what we see, instead of going in for uncritical appreciation.

 These are some of the issues that Prabhakar Kolte spoke about at an informal discussion organised by CIMA Gallery on Friday afternoon. 

 Without speaking from a height, the artist from Mumbai was very convincing because he spoke from his experience as a teacher about problems of integrity and honesty to the self that practitioners of art and writers face all the time.

 Speaking on how the younger generation is confused, he described his recent experience at an early morning prayer in Santiniketan, which he described as ?beautiful, without any real beauty,? because the students were like ?robots.? He could not help wondering what it was like in Rabindranath?s time because ?every essential thing was missing? now.

 He said artists are guided by an inner force. The other variety makes representations of ?objects? like a tsunami or an earthquake like when children in school are asked to paint a market scene. Instead of trying to paint like any particular artist they ?should be asked to see the source? ?why an artist paints in a certain way. Since most trainees do not do so, even after a seven-year course they remain confused.

 He wondered why such artists take up art at all because ?it is like labour pain? and needs total dedication.

 In the 1950?s, artists borrowed ideas and concepts from the West, neglecting our own masters like Nandalal, Sailoz Mukherjee and Benode Behari. Kolte underlined the fact that ?We believe in temporary things and call them permanent. So we survive but do not learn to live.?

 Kolte said students of art are taught technique instead of enjoying technique ? the joy of applying a wash on handmade paper and the texture it reveals. One should enjoy painting a portrait and not just ?transfer? it on canvas.

 Instead of hoping for a life of luxury through art, the only expectation of an artist should be a search for a language of his own that would be identifiable with his persona. He cited the example of Prabhakar Barwe and said his art was a reflection of himself.

 He came out strongly against the current practice of galleries to promote students which goes to their head. He bemoaned the lack of ?internship? in art unlike other disciplines. He concluded saying that there is a dire need for destroying the old order ? a tsunami is called for.

 Longing for latitude: Inmates at the Alipore Zoological Gardens 

 Apropos the report ?Alipore zoo faces survival test?, November 5, the survival of the zoo depends on the report submitted by Central Zoo Authority (CZA) after a survey. No institution, whether it is the zoo or a museum, should be allowed to function if the authorities do not maintain it properly. 

 The present condition of the zoo is not encouraging. The CZA norms make it mandatory for the animals in the zoo to be properly cared for. Even the enclosures should meet certain conditions. 

 It has been prescribed that each zoo appoints a curator to oversee its maintenance. Unfortunately, the Calcutta zoo does not have a curator yet. It is also doubtful whether its enclosures would meet the CZA norms. Most of the animals do not look too healthy, either. 

 In case the CZA report is not favourable, the zoo authorities will get a year?s time to improve on their weaknesses. But it is doubtful how much can be achieved in such a short span. 

 Of all the tourist attractions in Calcutta, the zoo is undoubtedly the top draw. If it loses the CZA recognition, not only the Calcuttans, but people from the districts and elsewhere, will be denied their favourite haunt on a winter afternoon. 

 In order to enable the authorities to spruce up their act, the state government should provide financial help to the zoo, if necessary. All possible measures should be taken to save it from closure. 

 Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

 Behala. 

 Apropos the report ?Car freeze in cadre raj?, November 8, the CPM cadre turned traffic in the city into a nightmare when the US-India joint military exercises were being held at least 130 km away, in Kalaikunda. Scores of people missed their flights to other cities due to the traffic snarls caused by the protesters. That the state administration did nothing, shows it in poor light. 

 Chandan Ray,

 Sakuntala Park. 

 The cadres are following the path that Biman Bose showed them. No resident of Calcutta supports this kind of CPM hooliganism. How long will this joke continue? How could the cadres disrupt public life in Calcutta when the joint military exercises were being held 130 km away in Kalaikunda? It seems the CPM finds pleasure in creating trouble for peace-loving citizens. The cadre raj will not last long. By the time the party realises its mistake in infringing on others? rights, it will be too late. 

 Madhabi D. Ghosh, 

 Salt Lake. 

 Calcutta was once again witness to political mayhem, this time from the cadres of the ruling party. It is amazing how politicians like Anil Biswas and Biman Bose fail to realise the hardship caused to the public by their actions. Even more amazing is the helplessness of the law-enforcing agencies and the courts in stopping such atrocities. No amount of condemnation is enough for such mindless acts by the ruling party. 

 Kalyan Ghosh, 

 Park Street.

 Bird lovers will be delighted that the wildlife wing has nabbed five poachers (Wildlife wing nets 5 for bird slaughter, November 10). Such poachers are also active near the Alipore zoo. They try to trap birds that nest in the zoo lake. Use of pesticides by farmers has severely affected the bird population. We need to protect our feathered friends at all cost. 

 B.N. Bose, 

 Dum Dum Park. 

 It was wonderful to learn that the wildlife wing has arrested five people for killing a cormorant and pond heron. Since the number of birds in the city has been dwindling, exemplary punishment should be meted out to the killers. 

 Prahlad Agarwala,

 Majdia, Nadia. 

 It is a matter of grief that birds are being slaughtered for money. If this is allowed to continue, several varieties of birds will become extinct. Rules and regulations against poaching are framed from time to time, but they are seldom enforced. The authorities need to immediately crack down on the killers. 

 Ratan Kumar Halder, 

 Behala. 

 Apropos ?CMC offices? in The City Diary on November 8, the Corporation has done the right thing by abolishing holidays to commemorate the death of councillors and former mayoral council members. The public has had to face a lot of harassment due to this practice. 

 Prantik Sanyal,

 Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Road. 

 Apropos the report ?Green board vs decibel demons?, November 7, it is good to know that the state pollution control board has taken an initiative to punish people for violating the noise-ban. Like the past few years, this year, too, aged people, patients and infants had to spend a noisy Diwali. Almost all puja committees used loudspeakers at will even after midnight. 

 Sourish Misra,

 Salt Lake. 

 Apropos the report ?Light rail transit back on track?, November 4, it is welcome news that the state government is attaching priority to setting up a rapid transit system in the city. The Calcuttans would heave a sigh of relief if the Centre gives the go-ahead to obtaining funds from banks for the East-West Metro. 

 Govinda Bakshi,

 Budge Budge.

 Apropos the report ?City trails in fuel switch?, November 7, it is disheartening that the chief minister is not as enthusiastic about cleaning up the city air as he is about attracting foreign investment and even reining in his party cadres. To make matters worse, the transport minister has remained lackadaisical in his approach to the pollution problem. So, trees are still being felled in the city. 

 Sunil Banerjee, 

 VIP Road. 

 Apropos ?Census tab on cabs and autorickshaws?, November 4, and ?City trails in fuel switch?, November 7, it seems nobody knows the actual number of autorickshaws plying in Calcutta. The reason is very simple. Apart from the registered autorickshaws, there are a large number of unregistered autorickshaws that ply on the road violating the norms of motor vehicles. 

 Why are the trade unions allowing these autorickshaws to ply without valid papers and not pressuring them to convert to LPG? These vehicles manage to obtain pollution control certificates by paying bribes between Rs 20 and Rs 50 to the people in the testing centres. 

 In addition, most of the LPG autorickshaws are fitted with fake gas kits and run on LPG cylinders. 

 S.M. Ghosh,

 Sarat Bose Road.

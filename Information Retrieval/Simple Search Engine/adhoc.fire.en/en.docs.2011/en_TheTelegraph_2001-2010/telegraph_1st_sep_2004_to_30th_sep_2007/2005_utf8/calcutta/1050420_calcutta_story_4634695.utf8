Blind date by the window

More decorative than utilitarian, funky 

window accessories are a rage in private spaces, says Himika Chaudhuri

The time has come to get the drapes of your home some 

company. Set the curtain up on a ?blind? date and see the duo bring a dash of 

delight into your home.

inds are the new window accessories hot among interior 

designers doing up windows with bamboo-stick blinds or blinds in fabrics. These 

easy-to-buy and made-to-order pieces can also translate your personal style to 

your home d?cor.

Ranging from high-end furnishing shops like Times 

and Skipper, to the humble shops near the fire brigade headquarters on Free School 

Street, you can?t turn a blind eye to the wide range of blinds on offer.

Bamboo boon

inds allow you to enjoy sunshine on your shoulders, 

minus the swelter. ?The play of sunshine on the floor and walls of your room when 

it creeps in through the crevices of the blinds is almost magical. It really adds 

to the fun of the room,? says interior designer Manjari Sahay.

Indeed, the thin bamboo sticks bound together by thread 

but with gaps to ensure that natural light comes through is a favourite among 

home-makers.

With innovations in the look, bamboo blinds are more 

decorative than utilitarian.

Teamed with colourful fabric and embellishments such 

as wooden beads, the blinds are often the prescription for picture-perfect pads.

Priced at Rs 195 per sq ft in the high-end shops and 

at Rs 100 to Rs 150 in the smaller outlets, these can help add colour and an ethnic 

feel to your room.

?We team blinds with curtains in an effort to reduce 

the heat as also to give the window a rich look,? says Sahay.

If panels of coloured fabric alternated with bamboo 

sticks is the newest trend this season, Times Furnishing on Park Street also has 

a self-designed blind where the fabric has been woven into bamboo sticks to give 

it a distinctive design.

?These are the newest additions in the market and 

are yet to invade homes in Calcutta,? suggests a spokesperson for the shop. Some 

of the bamboo blinds have been sealed off at the back with a layer of fabric to 

shut out the sunlight. 

?These are best for air-conditioned rooms,? suggests 

the spokesperson.

Cloth call

If bamboo is the old favourite, cloth is fast taking 

over as the new kid on the blinds block. Meant to replace the curtain, cloth blinds 

provide the perfect way to save on fabric. 

?In a curtain, a lot of material is lost in just getting 

the fall right,? explains a designer for a furnishing store.

Besides being a fabric saver, these cloth blinds are 

made to order and can be created according to one?s taste. ?You can choose the 

colours of the fabric and the blind can be made according to your design,? stresses 

a spokesperson for Orissa Blinds Corporation on Free School Street.

So you can actually let your imagination fly using 

a riot of colours, picking up embroidered cloth or sewing sequin to jazz up the 

piece.

Price tag: Rs 295 to Rs 795 per metre, inclusive of 

making charges.

All aluminium

A new addition this season is the rainbow-coloured 

aluminium blinds. Available at Free School Street stores at Rs 40 per sq feet, 

these are perfect for the verandah or the children?s room, where colours are called 

for.

Come clean

While the bamboo blinds can be washed with soap water, 

those that are fabric-intensive should be cleaned with a vacuum cleaner. 

The cloth blinds may be sent for dry cleaning, depending 

on material and embellishments used.

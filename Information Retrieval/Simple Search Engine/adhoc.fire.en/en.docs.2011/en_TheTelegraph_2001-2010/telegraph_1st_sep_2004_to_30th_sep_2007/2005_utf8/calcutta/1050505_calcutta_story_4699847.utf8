 It's Your Birthday So...

 Live for the moment; don?t fret over history. You are very optimistic. A little more planning and some more attention to practical details can get you to the top. You work well with those who inspire and guide you. In money matters, you need to loosen up a bit, without worrying too much about the future. ? Kusum Bhandari

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Screen On amp; Off

 Mixing it all up

A morally upright girl in Sarrkar and a totally 

negative character in Hotel Kingston, actress Mouli Ganguli is sure experimenting 

with the roles she is doing. She would, of course, love to work on the big screen 

but not just for the sake of it.

 ?I would do a role when I want to. It might be asking for too much but that is how I approach my career. There is no point being repetitive,? said Mouli during her brief visit to the city. 

 It was the K-serial Kaahin Kissi Roz that had made Mouli a household name across the country. She also had a brief stint in Kkusum but opted out because ?the character was not going anywhere?.

 Mouli adds: ?Even after I left Kkusum, I was approached by Balaji Telefilms for another serial. I excused myself politely because I was not convinced.? 

 Some members of the Lost cast: Stranded 

saga

 It?s a mini-series whose budget is equivalent to that of a Hollywood action movie. Lost is the next big thing on phoren television after Desperate Housewives. To premiere on STAR Movies this Saturday at 7 pm, the series is being promoted as ?the world?s best new drama?.

 Nominated for 12 Emmy Awards after its first season, Lost is about 48 people who survive a plane crash and are deserted on an unknown island in the Pacific Ocean. Mixing drama, suspense, death and fear, Lost ?promises to take you where television has never gone before?. As People magazine puts it: ?You?ll be gripping the arm of the chair like a white-knuckle flier on take-off!?

 Starring Matthew Fox (Party of Five, Haunted), Evangeline Lilly (Kingdom Hospital) and Naveen Andrews (Bride and Prejudice, The English Patient) among others, the first season of Lost depicts the first 40 days on the island. The pilot episode was, in fact, the most expensive in history, exceeding $11 million for the two-hour series opener.

 Billed as the IIFA of music awards, Sahara One Sangeet Awards will travel to Oakland this September having debuted at the Royal Albert Hall in London last year. Honouring excellence in Indian music on an international platform, 24 awards will be given out in three sections ? film music, pop music and critics awards in film music.

 The jury panel for Sangeet Awards 2005 comprises eminent names from the music and film industries like Ramesh Sippy, Suresh Wadkar, Kavita Krishnamurthy, Shankar Mahadevan, Leslie Lewis, Ken Ghosh, Anubhav Sinha, Shiamak Davar and Sapna Mukherji.

 Attended by the upper crust of Bollywood, this year?s ceremony will see live performances by Shah Rukh Khan and Rani Mukherjee.

 Speaking of the awards, Leslie Lewis told Metro: ?You can?t get more democratic than this with the best names in the business getting to choose the best performers. We are very happy with the nominees and all the more so since no remix song or artiste has been included.?

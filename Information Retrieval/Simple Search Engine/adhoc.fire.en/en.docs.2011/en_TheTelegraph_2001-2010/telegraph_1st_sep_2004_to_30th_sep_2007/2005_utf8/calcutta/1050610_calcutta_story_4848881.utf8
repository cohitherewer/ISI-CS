The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Onus on busmen

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The state government on Thursday threw the ball in the bus and truck operators? court, asking them to come up with suggestions on how the government could meet its commitment of cleaning up the Calcutta air.

 Indicating a softening of stand on its pre-1990 phase-out plan, transport minister Subhas Chakraborty on Thursday met bus, minibus as well as truck operators at Writers? Buildings and asked them for a feedback by June 25. 

 ?I told the truck and bus operators what the government feels on the issue. We have sought an opinion from the transporters. We will reach a definite decision after consulting the environment department on the issue,? minister Chakraborty said after the meeting.

 The minister?s earlier meeting with taxi associations on Wednesday ended in chaos, with a heated exchange followed by a walkout by the major unions.

 Joint council of Bus Syndicate general secretary Sadhan Das said the government?s decision to scrap the plying of old vehicles was wrong.

 ?Our economy doesn?t allow us to buy new buses and scrap old ones. We should be allowed to operate as long as our vehicles adhere to pollution norms. The transport minister has asked us to give him an alternative proposal,? he added.

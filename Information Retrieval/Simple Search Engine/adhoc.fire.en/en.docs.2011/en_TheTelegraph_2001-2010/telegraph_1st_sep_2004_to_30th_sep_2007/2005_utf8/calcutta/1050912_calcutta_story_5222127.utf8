 An exquisite array of traditional crafts hand-picked by connoisseurs from various parts of India. That, in a sentence, is the annual lifestyle exhibition at CIMA Gallery titled Art in Life, which starts today and will be on till October 8.

 Created by master craftsmen from different regions of the country, every piece on display has a story to tell ? some of a dying craft tradition, others of a survivalist attempt to contemporise ancient art forms.

 Most of the pieces have been created by master craftsmen, many of whom are National Award-winners. While we contacted the governments of various states to get in touch with the artisans, we came across some of the crafts through happy accidents, says chief administrator, CIMA, Pratiti Basu Sarkar.

 Artefacts in brass, bronze and metal sourced from different parts of south India, Orissa and Bengal form a sizeable part of the display. Idols of Durga, Krishna, Buddha and Ganesha and other temple pieces like lamps and bells made of brass, bronze and astadhatu are suitable for use in the puja room and can adorn the living room just as well. 

 The dokra selection is wide, with traditional pieces from Bastar in Chhattisgarh as well as the more modern polished ones from Bengal. These include tribal motifs, interesting Ganesha statuettes, Durga idols, wall hangings and a host of other showpieces.

 A wall hanging with animal and human motifs created by master craftsman Rameshwar catches the eye. As does a dokra presentation of a typical village bus with people sitting atop, created by the same craftsman.

 Another show-stealer in this section is a huge elephant. Works in metal include brass-framed mirrors from north India and other knick knacks from different regions. Also on display is a collection of old tribal masks, the kinds used during dance performances. 

 Traditional weaves from different Indian states form another part of the exhibition.Hand-woven Ikkat bedspreads done by master weavers of south India use modern designs provided by CIMA designers.

 We gave the weavers our designs since their own patterns are not always suitable for contemporary tastes. It has always been our endeavour to adapt traditional crafts for modern tastes, smiles Pratiti.

 There are bedspreads using Ajrak, a dying printing technique developed in north-west India, somewhere along the India-Pakistan border. Ajrak is a unique reversible printing technique specialised by only two families of that region. Its a dying tradition that needs to be revived since it is truly unique, she adds.

 Handwoven carpets in jute and banana fibre from Bengal and south Indian mats made of straw, bamboo and cane in vibrant colour combinations are interesting floor accessories.

 Stoles in original Benarasi weaves in beautiful pastels as well as bright colours are adorned with traditional motifs. Mashru fabrics from Gujarat and yards of hand-woven cotton are on offer, too.Chunky jewellery pieces for the neck, ears and arms come in glass, metal, dokra and beads. 

 This jewellery and knick-knacks section has always been very popular at CIMA. It offers small and highly affordable things that you can just pick up as gifts, says Pratiti.

 A highlight of this section is a range of burnt clay idols painted in the Kalighat style. This style of idol-making was the precursor to the Kalighat paintings.

 Traditional crafts is the focus, but the exhibition also presents some contemporary pieces, a few of which have been commissioned by CIMA. This includes a range of serving trays and bowls carved out of mahogany wood by craftsmen and then painted by artists.

 The contemporary section features a vast variety of showpieces created by designer Mandira Mallick from Delhi ? modernistic decoratives in glass, stone and metal.

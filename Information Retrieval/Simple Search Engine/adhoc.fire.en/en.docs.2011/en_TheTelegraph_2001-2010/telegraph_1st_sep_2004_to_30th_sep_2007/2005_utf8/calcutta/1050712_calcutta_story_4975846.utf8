 Natural colours

 By Sambhu Chakraborty

 Natures beauty has inspired some of the most celebrated creations in the world of art. Apart from revealing nature in all its glory, the ongoing exhibition of paintings by Sambhu Chakraborty, Nabakishore Chanda and Kishore Chakraborty serves as an expression of their appreciation of nature and its importance in our lives. Besides vividly capturing the rich flora and fauna of Bengal?s countryside, there is an interesting collection of paintings on show, juxtaposing man with nature. In the use of contrasting and complementary colours, and the overlapping of forms and figures, these works subtly draw our attention to the mutual dependence of the two. Images of nature in all its wild fury, as well as those picturing its calm, serene and gentle aspects appear side by side, enabling us to fully comprehend the power and beauty of nature in its various moods. At times expressing the restlessness of the artist and, at others, a complete surrender to nature?s charms, the show delights by virtue of its sheer capacity to stimulate a plethora of emotions.

 When: Till today, 2 pm - 7 pm

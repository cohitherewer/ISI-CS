 Meagre spending annoys UK body

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s government has earned the ire of Britain?s Department for International Development (DFID) for dragging its feet in the DFID-funded Calcutta Urban Services for the Poor (CUSP) project. 

 The government could spend only Rs 19 crore of the allotted Rs 37 crore in the first year of the Rs 700-crore project, which kicked off in July 2004. 

 In a recent review meeting with the department of economic affairs (DEA) and project officials in Delhi, DFID officials expressed displeasure with the spending pattern. 

 ?We told DFID that the pace has been slow because this was the first year of the project. We took time in finalising the plan components, recruiting people and setting up a framework in which to function. I?m sure that as we go along, the project will gain momentum,? said a state government official associated with the project. 

 However, officials said donors such as DFID like to see money well spent within the stipulated time frame. 

 ?The money is provided in phases. If it is not utilised within the specified timeframe, DFID?s budgeting goes haywire,? said a senior government official who has been liaising with DFID for several years.

 The government has given its word that it will make up by spending more than the projected amount of Rs 52 crore for next year. The officials have decided to spend Rs 73 crore next year.

 The issue came up in the Indo-UK Bilateral Consultation last month, the annual talks carried out between the DFID and DEA officials and attended by project officers from the participating states.

 Of the Rs 700-crore project spanning eight years, DFID contributed Rs 626 crore, while the state government is expected to shell out Rs 25 crore. DFID (India) is extending another Rs 77 crore under the head ?technical cooperation? funds.

 The first year of the project covered slum infrastructure development, including provision for water supply, sanitation involving the construction of individual and community toilets, drainage and internal roads in slums as well as solid waste management. 

 Around 105 slums (two each from every civic body) were shortlisted out of the 3,000 odd slums from 40 municipalities for this project. 

 These slums are in Kalyani, Howrah, Mahestala, Rajpur-Sonarpur, Chinsurah, Uttarpara, Uluberia, Dum Dum, Naihati, Barasat, Barrackpore, South Dum Dum, Titagarh and Baruipur municipalities in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area. 

 In addition to this, Rs 4 crore is being spent on accounting reforms being introduced in the urban bodies. This includes preparation of opening balances and switching from single-entry to double-entry system. According to officials, 12 civic bodies have prepared their opening balances so far.

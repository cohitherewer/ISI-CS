 Defence in demur mode

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY AND JULIUS GOMES 

 Counsel for an accused doctor in the Rajnis Patel case on Friday refused to cross-examine Munni Devi, mother of the budding cricketer who died at SSKM Hospital after five botched surgeries.

 Ashish Kha, representing Souvik Bardhan, argued in the sub-divisional judicial magistrate?s court that he would question Munni Devi only after Amitabha Ganguly, counsel of ?principal accused? Dilip Majumdar, finished cross-examining the witness.

 Kha?s deposition led to a prompt rejoinder by public prosecutor Naba Kumar Ghosh. The two argued for 25 minutes, a bewildered and tearful Munni Devi watching the proceedings helplessly from the witness box.

 Counsel Ganguly is out of town and is expected to return only on February 21. On Thursday, the defence team had been reprimanded by magistrate Manjit Singh for Ganguly?s absence. The defence, Singh said, was delaying the trial.

 Following Kha?s submission, public prosecutor Ghosh pointed out that there was no hierarchy among the accused. ?Though Majumdar?s name comes first in the list of the accused, he should not be referred to as ?principal accused?.?

 Taking wind out of the defence sail, Ghosh argued that the lawyers of Sandip Manna and Jayanta Mondol, whose names were preceded by that of Souvik Bardhan in the charge-sheet, had already cross-examined Munni Devi.

 Earlier, the public prosecutor had prayed that the witness be discharged, as she was being ?harassed? by defence counsel. The court fixed February 21 for the next hearing.

 Self-eviction, silently

 - 60-year homes dismantled amidst dread of future

 Some 60 years ago, a sprightly Radha Rani Dey had come away from erstwhile East Pakistan with her family to set up home, a small thatched structure by the railway tracks at Gobindapur.

 On Thursday morning, she sat stooped and silent on those railway tracks, watching her home, that small thatched structure, being demolished by her family.

 After years of defiance, as evacuation time ran out on Thursday, the Gobindapur rail colony emptied itself out ? not a shot fired and not a slogan raised.

 Radha Rani, now a frail 80, had come to Calcutta after riots broke out on the other side of the border. This was the house by which steam engines would pass, from where she was married off and where she returned after her husband?s death to stay with her nephew.

 ?I had never dreamt that at this age I would have to leave my parental house,? cried Radha Rani as the tiles of her house were being removed and the bamboo ceiling broken down.

 Radha Rani was one of around 20,000 settlers of the colony stretching on both sides of the railway tracks, from Tollygunge to Ballygunge, busy dismantling homes and dreading the future.

 Though the state government has provided 10 acres to the settlers at Nonadanga, a few kilometres off the EM Bypass-Rashbehari Avenue connector, Gobindapur residents are apprehensive how things will work out.

 ?What will happen to our children studying in schools?? asked Saroj Bairagi. The tuberculosis patient who runs a grocery shop nearby, will lose his source of livelihood with a shift to Nonadanga.

 As will so many other settlers. Little wonder then that seeking shelter with relatives or on rented space in the locality, or along the rail route, is taking priority over a settlement in Nonadanga.

 ?Temporary shelters will be built by those who do not have relatives or cannot afford to rent a room nearby,? said Baburam Pramanik, secretary of Ballygunge-Tollygunge Railway Sangram Committee.

 An estimated 3,000 women from this colony go out every day to work as domestic helps. The colony also provides plumbers, masons, sweepers and daily wagers to south Calcutta homes all around.

 As hundreds took to the tracks, their homes demolished, there was a solitary pocket of protest. Around 100 families of Lake colony at Charu Chandra Place East refused to participate in the self-eviction drive alleging that their names had been added to the list ?afterwards?.

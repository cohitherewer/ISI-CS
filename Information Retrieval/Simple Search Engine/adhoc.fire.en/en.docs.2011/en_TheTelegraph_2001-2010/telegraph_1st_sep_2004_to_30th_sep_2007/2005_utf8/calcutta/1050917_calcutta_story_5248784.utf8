 On the eve of Vishwakarma puja, three men at Putiary Club are working hard on stacks of kites. But these are not meant to take flight on Saturday. The 58th edition of the club?s Durga puja is using ghuri and latai to deck up its pandal. 

 ?We will be using about 3,500 kites,? says puja committee president A.K. Sen. The types that lie scattered on the floor are various ? delta, petkati, mayurpankhi, bogga, chandiyal, mombati, mukhpora.... ?We have done some research and included gigantic foreign makes as well,? he adds.

 So dragons from China, Japanese kites depicting warriors, priests and folk heroes, birds from Vietnam and leaf kites from Indonesia will be on view. ?But we have not readied them yet. In this competitive market, there should be some secrecy,? says Indrajit Kundu, one of the three theme-makers.

 The chandoya over the Devi will be the octagonal Indian deluxe fighter. Two giant latais will stand at an incline to form the welcoming arch. 

 The kite industry, says joint secretary Sudipto Thakur, is fading out. ?We want to give it a boost while appealing for an eyeful of sky in this concrete jungle.?

 Will para boys not get upset at being denied the chance to fly the kites on the big day? ?These kites are made of cotton to withstand the elements. But we will distribute tissue paper kites so that the boys can fly them in the vicinity. The kites will get caught in the branches of trees nearby and add a natural look to what we are calling our ghurir bhuban (world of kites).?

 How about accompanying Mahatma Gandhi on the Dandi March? Or occupying seats in the Central Hall of Parliament? Starting August 15, 2006, this may be a ?virtual? reality.

 Kolkata Panorama, the hi-tech narrative museum in Calcutta Town Hall, is busy fabricating a Parliament Museum, conceived by Saroj Ghose (who had earlier conceptualised Science City) and designed by Amit Sarkar and Debabrata Basu.

 A team of 30 artists, carpenters, clay craftsmen from Kumartuli, computer professionals and other technicians is fabricating the 3D models and interactive panels. Research and final alterations are on.

 ?It is very important that the master layout and detailed drawings are followed to scale, as the models will be transported in fragments and reassembled again in Delhi. For this a core team will travel to the capital around August,? said Ghose.

 Spread over 1,515 sq m, the Parliament Museum will be a first, with a fully computerised display. At an estimated cost of Rs 4.5 crore, there will be walk-through exhibits where the period settings will be complemented by sound and light to recreate the ambience.

 Multi-screen panoramic projections, visitor-operated computer facility and animatronics will also be used to make the presentations life-like.

 The plan has won the consensus of all parliamentary parties. The museum will be located in the library building and will be open to visitors through a separate entrance. Public tours will start with a visit to a recreated archaeological site, from where visitors will be introduced to the roots of Indian self-governance from evidences in the Mahabharata, Arthashastra and the chronicles of Megasthenes.

 A 3D recreation of Akbar?s Deewan-e-Aam and a simulation of the historic Dandi march will be highlights of the tour. Life-size statues in procession will represent the unity and diversity of India.

 ?We have acquired a very rare copy of Jawaharlal Nehru?s famous speech on January 24, proclaiming that two days later India would be a Republic. So, we have planned an animatronic model of Nehru that will deliver the speech with life-like movements,? said Ghose.

 A dynamic exhibit, to be constantly updated, will be a computerised panel giving data on every political party.

 The museum will also have a resource centre for parliamentarians, researchers and students.

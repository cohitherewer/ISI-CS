 Rosebuds and rugby are classes

 - New nomenclature will instil sense of belonging and pride, feels school

 RICHA BANSAL

 ?I am in Rosebud A and will soon be in Rugby C.? Words of an eight-year-old from MP Birla Foundation Higher Secondary School might puzzle you. But do believe her, for the institution is all set to rename its classes.

 Working on the premise that a child is an entity and wouldn?t like to identify itself with a number, the school has decided to rechristen its classes after flowers, birds, sports, etc, from the next session, starting November.

 As of now, the schoolteachers are brainstorming on the names that would replace Lkg, Ukg, Class I, II and the rest. ?We will begin with primary classes and then move on to higher ones, as the cost incurred to renew the entire database is immense,? says principal Herbert George.

 The new nomenclature will instil a sense of belonging and pride among the students and teachers alike, feels George. ?They will identify themselves with the values associated with the name and try to improve as they graduate to a higher level. If a child moves on from Rosebud A, B or C to a sport or a bird at the next level, he/she will tend to feel upbeat,? he adds.

 Psychiatrist Aniruddha Deb agrees. ?A name does give an identity, which works better than numbers. But whether or not it would influence the academic performance of the child can be gauged only over time,? he says.

 The concept, he says, is an old one. ?There are schools which name their houses after famous persons or name student groups after flowers or animals for classroom-based activities,? he says. 

 Approving of the concept, Anjali Razdan, principal, Lakshmipat Singhania Academy, says: ?Innovations work positively, but one has to keep at it.? The idea has also revived a long-cherished wish of hers. She explains: ?Our classrooms are called ?homerooms?. For quite some time, I have been thinking of naming them after the teachers ? Mrs Decosta?s homeroom or Mrs Roy?s homeroom. Maybe, I?ll do it now.?

 At Loreto Sealdah, for years, class sections have been named after colours. ?Recently, a class changed its colour from grey to gold,? says principal Sister Cyril.

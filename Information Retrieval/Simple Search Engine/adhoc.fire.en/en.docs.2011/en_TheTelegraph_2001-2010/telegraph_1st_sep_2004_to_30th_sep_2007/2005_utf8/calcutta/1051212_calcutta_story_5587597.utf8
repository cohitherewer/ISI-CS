The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 The LPG crisis is aggravated because of diversion of supply to commercial establishments 

in the marriage season. The domestic consumers are the worst hit in many pockets 

of the city as they get the cylinders many weeks after booking. To check this 

inconvenience, the LPG distributors should maintain a separate stock for domestic 

consumers all year round. Perhaps, the cylinders meant for caterers and restaurants 

can be painted in a different colour to make the segregation easier. 

 Md Moinuddin, Jamadar Khan Lane. 

 At the Lee Road-Elgin Road crossing, a swank pay-and-use toilet has replaced 

an old one. Surprisingly, on many occasions I have noticed that the toilet is 

kept under lock and key. Finding no alternative, passers-by urinate on the walls 

of Sambhunath Pandit Hospital. Local residents are forced to put up with the soiled 

footpaths and nauseating stench in the area. I request the local councillor to 

look into the problem immediately. 

 Jyoti Baksi, Heysham Row. 

 Recently while returning from Kharagpur, I dropped in at a famous hotel in 

Macheda (Kolaghat) for a meal. To my disgust, I found a nail in the chanamasala 

that I had ordered for. I reported it to the staff but they didn?t even bother 

to apologise.

 Breathing life into BBD Bag

 A STAFF REPORTER

 In an effort to consolidate efforts of breathing new life into the historic Dalhousie Square, a two-day workshop on the conservation and improvement of the area commenced on Friday.

 Organised by the state department of information and cultural affairs, ARCH (Action Research in Conservation of Heritage) and INTACH (Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage), the workshop was inaugurated by Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi and attended by mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya.

 The forum will provide a platform for stakeholders to share plans for reviving the heritage zone, to formulate the way forward and to create a blueprint for the conservation and management of the Square.

 ?We Indians cherish our history, but neglect our heritage. We commemorate; we do not conserve,? said the governor in his address, stressing that examples of colonial architecture are no longer a symbol of the Raj, but are ?masterpieces of Indian workmanship?.

 ?Dalhousie Square? survives. It needs to do more. It needs to thrive. To help it do so is not to pander to any particular era; it is to keep part of our tangible memory alive,? he added.

 Speakers at the consultative meet, held at the Bengal Chamber of Commerce, included heritage and conservation experts, led by Barun De, member of the Heritage Commission.

 Urban design experts, senior architects like Dulal Mukherjee, state government and civic body officials, and archaeologists from the Archaeological Survey of India will also participate.

 At 7.30 am on Saturday, a heritage walk at Dalhousie Square, listed as one of the 100 endangered heritage sites by the World Monuments Fund, will be held.

 Roses will rule month-end

 Fume-and-filth Calcutta may not be anybody?s idea of a bed of roses, but roses are the rage this month.

 For, the All India Rose Convention is returning to the city after 13 years. Come January 14, roses will enrich the lawns of Agri Horticultural Society of India (AHSI), on Alipore Road. 

 The 184-year-old society, in association with the Bengal Rose Society, is stitching together the country?s biggest rose show in town.

 ?We are organising the event under the aegis of Indian Rose Foundation, which is the apex body of rosarians (rose-lovers). Every year, the show goes to a different city and we are happy to bring this flagship event to Calcutta,? said G.N. Ghosh, secretary, Bengal Rose Society, celebrating its silver jubilee this year.

 The three-day event will attract over 800 delegates, 400 from outside Calcutta. ?The event is aimed at promoting rose culture and cultivation in the state, which was started in Bengal by Sibaprasad Bandyopadhyay and Rammoi Maharaj around 25 years ago. We will also showcase some newly-bred rose varieties,? said Ghosh. 

 Some nurseries in the state are cultivating internationally-appreciated varieties like Etoile-de-France, Monte Zuma and Mainu Perle.

 There is an enormous potential in commercial rose culture, as Calcutta is ranked fourth in terms of its spending on roses, after Chennai, Bangalore and Delhi. Several varieties ? priced at a premium ? are imported from markets like Bangalore and Pune. 

 Data available from flower boutique Pushpalata, on Hazra Road, support this hypothesis. ?While local roses are usually sold for Rs 200 for 100 stems, the Dutch roses from Bangalore and Pune are priced at Rs 100-150 for 20 stems,? said florist Anasuya Basu. 

 The imported ones are odourless, the colours range from pink and red to yellow and white and they last for at least three days, while local buds like Minipol and Monte Zuma tend to start drooping within a day.

 ?Now, it?s time for roses from Bengal to hit the export market and the event will give local growers and breeders a chance to showcase their products,? said Deepak Erasmus, secretary-cum-CEO, AHSI.

 To further the cause, organisers have planned a conducted tour of local nurseries for outstation delegates on the final day of the programme.

 Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi and Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee will be present at the inaugural function on January 14. On Day Two, the organisers have lined up a panel of experts, who will speak on rose culture and its commercial aspects. The evening will see a prize distribution ceremony. 

 ?Besides giving rose-lovers a chance to see the various breeds, we want local nurseries to learn how to increase market share,? summed up Ghosh.

 Nostalgia sips and new-age stops

 The first impossibility is finding an English synonym for adda, one that captures the true essence of the word. The second is to drag a Bengali away from an adda over steaming cups of tea.

 But while adda remains adda, the way they drink their tea and the places where they do so are certainly witnessing some vital changes. Thanks to the new-age tea bars that have sprung up in various parts of the city, the age-old tea stalls are all but pass? for many. GoodLife dwells on the great divide between the traditional cha haunts and todays tea bars.

 Diverse decor

 Think of tea and perhaps the oldest haunt that comes to mind is Balwant Singhs Eating House at 10/B Harish Mukherjee Road, adjacent to the Gurdwara. Established in the pre-Independence era way back in the 1930s, this dhaba is known not for its sparkling setting but for its steaming cuppa.

 Despite the shabby look, the crossroad cacophony, and the constant clatter of the kulhar, the number of Honda Citys and Hyundai Accents dotting the stretch could give any star address a run for its clientele.

 Even at the oddest hour of the night, you will find couples cosying up over a cup of hot tea, friends having one last adda before parting for the night and families catching up on their last sip while returning home from dinner, says Ramesh Singh, who runs the show at Balwants now.

 Cut to the new-age tea-bar. Calcuttas first brush with this concept happened when Dollys Tea Shop came up in the late 90s at Dakshinapan Shopping Complex. A world apart from the Harish Mukherjee Road haunt, Dollys with its thatched roofshades, low-lying, cushioned cane furniture and lots of greenery exuded a lot of warmth, attracting shoppers and college-goers in hordes.

 Following close on the heels of Dollys succees were tea destinations like the Cha Bar at Oxford and the Camelia Tea Bar chain.

 Each of Camelia Tea Bars five outlets ? at Saturday Club, CC amp;FC, Calcutta Swimming Club, Woodlands Medical Clinic and the rooftop of Samilton Hotel on Sarat Bose Road ? boasts a unique decor. While in the clubs it is more grand, the Samilton outlet is chic and trendy, aimed at a younger clientele.

 Walking into the calm of the Cha Bar on the first floor of Oxford Bookstore is quite a different experience altogether. Not the trademark Calcutta adda over a cuppa here. At this swank new-age tea bar with plush wooden furniture, you will find people rapt in reading or labouring at a laptop with a cup of tea for company.

 Says Maina Bhagat, event consultant, Oxford Bookstore: Books and tea make for the perfect combination. At home we do it often. We wanted to recreate the same atmosphere so that people can spend hours over their favourite pages and flavours. Our clientele is different, very few people come here to hang out.

 Variety fare

 Iced tea, mint tea, orange tea, ayurvedic tea? Options may be many, but nothing probably beats a cup of plain or masala chai after a hard days night. And that is what makes Balwant Singhs the favoured destination for many. On offer: plain or masala tea in khullars.

 The magic potion is prepared with tea leaves in a cloth pouch, boiled in steaming water. And once we have extracted the liquor, the leaves are discarded. Milk is then added and the blend poured into a large vessel containing hot water. We never expose the tea leaves directly to the flame. This helps retain the original flavour of the tea, says Ramesh.

 And for a light bite with your evening cup of tea, Balwant Singhs offers some lip-smacking Chinese Samosas, Paneer Pakodas and Gobi Pakodas.

 Innovations and improvisations are on the anvil. We are planning to introduce more authentic Punjabi snacks on the menu. We also have a good mind to give a complete makeover to the decor, doing it up like a traditional Punjabi household, reveals Ramesh.

 The new-age tea bars definitely score with their varied fare. For instance, at the Camelia chain one gets to sip on a cup of Qahwa (green tea made of ginger, honey, cinnamon), Yogic Assam Tea, Thai Chai (with coconut cream, honey and milk), Rose Petal Tea and Hot Buttered Apple Tea among the hot flavours, besides a host of cold ones on offer. 

 These days people want to experiment with food and drinks. So, our innovative flavours are the main draw. The process of innovation is always on, says Debjani Roy, who heads the Camelia Tea Bar chain in Calcutta. Snacks range from hot popcorns to brownies and English teacakes aimed at the youngsters.

 The Oxford Cha Bar menu boasts a wide variety of flavours. We stock everything from Indian to international. Some of the special varieties include Green Tea Margarita and Crushed Iced Mint Tea. These flavours go down perfectly with the soothing atmosphere here.

 Pocket pinch

 The delicious masala chai at Balwants comes for Rs 2 a cup, while the snacks are priced at Rs 10-plus. Ours is a traditional place where people have been coming to for years to hang out. So, we want to stick to our low pricing. An average Calcuttan would not want to spend more than Rs 2 on a cup of tea during an adda, says Ramesh, whose outlet has drawn star footfall from Satyajit Ray to Kareena Kapoor.

 The new tea bars, on the other hand, start their price point from Rs 70. It is basically the ambience that people come to us for. And hence they do not hesitate to pay up as well, feels Bhagat of Oxford.

 People of Calcutta are still to wake up to the concept of fancy chai bars. They still prefer the little shop around the corner, admits Debjani of Camelia.

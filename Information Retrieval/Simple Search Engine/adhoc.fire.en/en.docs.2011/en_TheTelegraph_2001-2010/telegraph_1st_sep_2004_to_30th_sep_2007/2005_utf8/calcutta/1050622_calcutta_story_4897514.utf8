 Cafe call in cine stop

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 Its the latest sip--bite joint in the New Market para and the first in a series of expansions for the chain. Baristas new outlet in the New Empire cinema (picture by Rashbehari Das) premises is just three weeks old and is already doing good business.

 The response has been fantastic, says Brotin Banerjee, vice-president (marketing and strategy), Barista. The store is running full and the only complaint so far has been the lack of space.

 The New Empire outlet, with ground floor and mezzanine floor seating, can accommodate around 40 people.

 The New Empire stop is little more than a stones throw away from the Park Street outlet but the movie and shopping crowd ensures a steady stream of customers. We do not have any two other stores so close to each other in Calcutta, admits Banerjee, but it hasnt affected our Park Street sales at all.

 The coffee chain plans to add two more stores in the city by August and is scouting for additional space in Salt Lake and Gariahat. One of the main criterions is that the store should have the potential to do business worth Rs 3.5-4 lakh a month, says Banerjee. The Park Street store manages sales of Rs 7.5 lakh per month.

 One of the two new outlets is being planned as a marquee store, occupying 2,200 sq ft. The set-up will be very different from our existing stores. Besides ready-to-eats, consumers can have full meals which will be freshly prepared and the best coffees from around the world will be served. There will also be more comfort-seating arrangement and performances by live bands, Banerjee explains.

 Barista has recently launched its summer menu, adding several new items in both beverages and foods. The Barista Sugarfree Delite, for the health conscious, offers low-calorie cold coffee with skimmed milk and comes in coffee, mocha and caramel flavours.

 Other new cool options include iced fruit infusions and teas made with wild berry and raspberry. In foods, theres a new range of salads, including Herbed Chicken in Caesar Dressing and Tangy Corn and Carrot in Thai Chilly Dressing.

 The company is also launching its Blue Rewards Programme, offering patrons a loyalty card with which they can earn redeemable points during purchases. The card will have a microchip which will store information about the customer, Banerjee adds.

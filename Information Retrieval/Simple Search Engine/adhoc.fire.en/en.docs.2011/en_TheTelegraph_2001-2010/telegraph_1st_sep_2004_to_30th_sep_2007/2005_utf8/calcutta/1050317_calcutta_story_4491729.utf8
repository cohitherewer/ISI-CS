 Cooking up cricket craze

If there is one thing that can rival Calcutta?s obsession with cricket, it?s the fervour for food. When the two meet, the results are bound to be worth a mouthful. Here are four promotions launched to coincide with the India-Pakistan test in town.

 Kewpies

What better way to greet the visiting Pakistanis than 

by providing them an authentic taste of Calcutta cuisine? Kewpies is cooking up 

delightful thalis to please every palate, particularly those of Pakistani 

origin. From March 16 to 20, the Elgin Lane eatery is offering friends from across 

the border a free lunch or dinner. But do carry proof of nationality (passport 

or driving license).

 ?I would have loved it if General Musharraf came and enjoyed a free meal at Kewpies! However, I?ll still have to verify his passport!? laughs restaurateur Rakhi Purnima Dasgupta. If you?re of Indian origin, accompany your Pakistani friends and avail a discount of 15 per cent.

 The meals have been divided into four categories ? the vegetarian thali priced at Rs 250 and the fish, chicken and meat thalis at Rs 265 each. Seasonal specials include vegetarian dishes such as Doi Potol, Potol Channar Dolma, Dab Jhinge and Enchorer Kalia. Perennial favourites star in the non-vegetarian section, like Murgi Kosha, Kosha Mangsho and the delicious Pathar Jhol. Options for the fish lover are the Mango Fish Fry, Chingri Jhal, Dab Chingri and Elish Bhape.

 Taj Bengal

Taj Bengal, where both Team India and its Pakistani 

rivals are putting up, is pulling out all the stops for its high-profile guests.

 Sonargaon and Chinoiserie have come up with dinner menus to pamper the taste buds of cricket stars and fans who troop in to catch a glimpse. Says executive chef Surinder Singh: ?I have known both the Indian and Pakistani cricketers for almost 15 years. I have a fair idea of what they like and the menus have been drawn up keeping that in mind.?

 While the sportsmen prefer to stick to fruits and cereals for breakfast and have a light lunch on the field, dinner is a full meal. ?The Pakistani players prefer Indian food, while the Indians fancy Chinese mostly,? reveals Singh. There are exceptions. For instance, Rahul Dravid is more likely to order Continental khana.

 The menu at Sonargaon focuses almost entirely on kebabs. ?The players prefer barbecued food over gravies so we have introduced a wide variety of kebabs,? he adds. The menu includes vegetarian choices like Badami Aloo, Rajma Gilawat and Kabooli Tikka among others. The non-veg fare includes some exotic kebabs like Amritsari Kekda (ajwain flavoured deep fried soft-shell crab), Murgh Gilafi Seekh (mildly spiced aromatic chicken mince kebab cooked on skewers) and Murg Sina Bhatti (cardamom and saffron flavoured chicken supreme cooked on charcoal).

 The Chinese eatery entices with a tofu and tiger prawn fiesta. There are eight tiger prawn delicacies, among which the chef recommends Tiger Prawns in Singapore Chilli Sauce. ?For the vegetarians we have a selection of tofu dishes, too,? adds Singh.

 Both the festivals, part of Cricket Fever, are on till March 20.

Sourav?s and The Atrium

Both Sourav?s: The Food Pavilion and The Atrium at 

The Park have decided to bring Gawalmandi ? the buzzing food street of Lahore 

? to town.

 The cricket-special menu at One Day, the coffee shop at the Indian skipper?s signature establishment, is cramped with names of some mouth-watering kebabs and meat preparations that are otherwise difficult to find in Calcutta. Try the Sialkot Badshai Murg for instance. Get spiced up with Mutton Chilli Fry (shredded mutton with green and red chilli) and cool your tummy down with Doodh Faluda, Chatti ki Lassi and Kashmiri Chai. Try for a taste till March 29.

 At The Atrium Caf?, atmosphere is as important as the grub.

 ?The walled city of Lahore is a gourmet?s paradise, which offers anything from a light snack to a full meal, from early morning to well past midnight. Gawalmandi is a non-descript street cluttered with food joints,? explains F amp;B manager Anirban Simlai. The festival is on between 1 pm and 1 am till the end of the Calcutta test.

 Start off with the thick Adraki Lassi (yoghurt churned with ginger and roasted cumin). The next gourmet step for non-vegetarians is a lamb clear soup called Yahani. Then, take your pick from Mahi Lahori (deep-fried boneless fish in a tangy marinade), Murgh Kastoori Kebab (Chicken marinated with cheese and cream and laced with egg) and Sajji (pot-roasted leg of baby lamb with potli masala). Beef-eaters can try the Beef Bihari Tikka (succulent pieces of beef marinated with spices) and Chapali Kebab (pan-fried beef patties with dry pomegranate).

 The Makai Seekh Kebab (corn with fresh herbs) and Paneer Tikka Peshawari (cottage cheese marinated in yoghurt and flavoured with a special masala) are great options for vegetarians.

 To add some weight to your meal, staples in the form of Keema Wali Naan or the filling Sindhi Biryani are sure winners. End your meal on a sweet note with Badam Halwa, Khubani Ka Phirni or Zaffran Aur Pista Kulfi Faluda.

 What?s more, your gourmet stroll through Gawalmandi doesn?t end with food. There?s a paanwala and a churiwalla for that touch of authenticity.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cop counsel against tease

 A STAFF REPORTER

 With the Pujas round the corner and street-smart Romeos already on the prowl, Calcutta Police have decided to conduct interactive sessions with girl students in colleges across the city on how to tackle eve-teasers, lodge an FIR, and on steps to be taken if cops refuse to file the complaint.

 The primary thrust would be on ways to raise an alarm in case of an incident. ?In most cases of eve-teasing, the women suffer in silence. At these sessions, we will encourage them and teach them to come forward and speak out against the crime,? explained Rajesh Subarno, deputy commissioner of police (detective department, special).

 To begin with, police officers will interact with students of women?s colleges in north Calcutta. Then, they will move on to other educational institutions across the city. The officers will also give a patient hearing to the problems faced by students in handling eve-teasers in public places.

 The arrests of six eve-teasers on Saturday and Sunday prompted the cops to reach out to the girl students on the issue. While businessman Manas Kumar Nag, 42, and shop-owner Kartick Pal, 31, were rounded up in Gariahat on Sunday, a mobile team of plainclothesmen arrested Raj Kumar Chowdhury and Raju Seikhin the New Market area.

 ?The offenders were unaware that our women constables were keeping a watch on them. On being caught, each first feigned ignorance and then pleaded for mercy,? said an officer of the team.

 Apart from stepping up vigilance in shopping areas and counselling college students, police have also decided to form a special squad to act in an emergency.

 Whenever in distress, women can call toll-free helplines 1091 and 1092. Stationed at the police headquarters at Lalbazar, members of the special squad will reach the spot at the earliest to help the victim.

 Plainclothesmen have also been put on patrol duty to curb the incidence of snatching and teasing at bus stops, roadside eateries, malls and markets during the festive season.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Guy with whom Garcia played

 Tuesday night was different at Someplace Else (SPE). Not only because the pub crowd filled the Park Street address till way past midnight on a weekday, but also because of the man they were there for.

 The short, nondescript guitar player held the attention of the crowd and his fellow bandmates ? SPE regulars Krosswindz ? for over four hours.

 Also, Sanjay Mishra is a non-white Asian who hasn?t topped charts in recent times and his music struggles hard to find a label to fit under.

 The label that has stuck on the Calcutta-born US-based musician, however, is the guy with whom Jerry Garcia played on one of his last recorded albums.

 ?It came about in a strange way,? recalled Mishra, the day before the SPE performance. It was 1991 and Mishra was a struggling musician in the US, where he had moved from Calcutta to study music.

 ?I thought life would be easy for a graduate of the prestigious Peabody Conservatory of Music. I was wrong.? There were ?thousands and thousands of great guitarists on the streets and pubs of America, all looking for a break and it was harder for a foreigner to break in?.

 Not giving up, Mishra compiled a CD of his compositions ? The Crossing ? and mailed it to leading music magazines for review. ?America completely ignored it and only the European magazine Classical Guitar gave a good review.?

 It was in 1993 when Mishra was working with Greenpeace in Washington DC that he met the founder member of Grateful Dead ? playing in the city ? and his life changed. ?His wife, Deborah, came to my office for some work and he accompanied her. When he was leaving, I gave him my CD for a listen. But I knew he must be getting these from hundreds of musicians everyday and wasn?t expecting anything.?

 Next day when Mishra called Deborah, Jerry Garcia picked up the phone. ??Sanjay, where are you, man? I loved your CD?, said the man. Later I heard he had driven around the city with my album playing in his car.?

 December 1994 saw Mishra record with Garcia at the Grateful Dead studio in San Francisco. ?He played on three of my tracks, whereas he has only guested with a handful of people in his entire career,? Mishra?s eyes lit up.

 The compositions were included in Mishra?s Blue Incantation, released in 1995 to critical acclaim. It turned Mishra?s world around ?by 180 degrees?. There have been sellout concerts and subsequent albums from the classical guitarist since then, but nothing has quite matched the Garcia magic.

 Though the city of his birth, Mishra had never played in Calcutta till Tuesday night or in India till a Delhi concert last week. ?Simply because I have never felt welcome. I had contacted the jazz fest organisers on my own, but I was told I didn?t fit the format. So I thought if I didn?t fit in my home city, I wouldn?t in the rest of India either.?

 The ?warm reception? in Delhi and the big thumbs up at SPE on Tuesday night made him change his mind. ?I?ll try to come back more often now,? Mishra promised.

 Along with the crowd at SPE, which was treated to Mishra?s originals like Rescue, Clouds and Country Eastern, supported brilliantly by Krosswindz, we?ll be waiting.

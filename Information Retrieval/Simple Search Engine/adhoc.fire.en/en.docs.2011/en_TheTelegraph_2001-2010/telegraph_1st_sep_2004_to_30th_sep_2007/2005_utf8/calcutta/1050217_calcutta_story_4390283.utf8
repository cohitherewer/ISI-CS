 Fun in the family

 It tasted super success adapting a hit American talent hunt concept. Now Sony Entertainment Television plans to do the trick again with a localised version of a popular British comedy chat show.

 Wednesday marked the launch of Batliwalla House No. 43, a ?licensed adaptation? of the hugely successful British series, The Kumars At No. 42. On the lines of Kumars? (aired in India on STAR World), Batliwalla? will be hosted by a quirky Parsi family with two celebrity guests on every episode.

 The Batliwallas run a bakery by day, and have converted their workers? toilet area into a wacky makeshift studio to interview the celebrities. The hero of the show is the starstruck son ? Shahrukh Batliwalla, convinced that the chat show is his ticket to stardom. His father, mother and grandmother comprise the rest of the motley crew who back Shahrukh all the way.

 The cast comprises television and stage veterans. Mahabanoo Kotwal (remember her as Mrs Nair in Black?) plays the grandmother, Delnaz Paul portrays the mother, Sanjeev Vatsa fills the shoes of the disciplined and know-all father and Bakhtyar Irani stars as Shahrukh.

 The comedy aims to make Sony?s Friday programming even stronger. ?The channel?s strong Friday line-up has consistently delivered numbers for us. With the launch of Batliwalla?, Sony Entertainment Television is further beefing up its robust franchise on Fridays,? said Tarun Katial, executive vice-president and business head, Sony Entertainment Television.

 Some of the celebrities scheduled to grace the house of the Batliwallas include Bollywood actors Tusshar Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra, Lilette Dubey and Anupam Kher, small-screen stars Mandira Bedi and Smriti Irani and cricketer Harbhajan Singh. Besides, cross promotion for Indian Idol will include the top two contestants from the talent-hunt show and two of its three judges Sonu Nigam and Anu Malik doing a star turn.

The characters in the Indian avatar are really localised 

versions of the British show. Shahrukh is a 30-year-old who dreams of breaking 

big into Bollywood and even thinks himself to be more popular than the guests 

he actually interviews. Jamshed Batliwalla, the father, is a disciplined 56-year-old 

who knows just about everything on confectionery, cars, carpentry, politics and 

crime. Gulshan Batliwalla, the mother, lives in her small world of vanity and 

embroidered saris and uses exotic home-made concoctions to keep her complexion 

young and radiant. 

 But it?s the 76-year-old grandmother, Meherbanoo, who should steal the show like in the British version. She is the wit of the family with a glad eye for the male guests.

 With Indian Idol nearing its grand finale, Batliwallas? may well prove to be the next big thing for Sony.

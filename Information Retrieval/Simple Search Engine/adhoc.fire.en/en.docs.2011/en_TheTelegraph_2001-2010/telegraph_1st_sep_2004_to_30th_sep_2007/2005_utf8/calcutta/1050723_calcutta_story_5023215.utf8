 London spectre at airport

 - UNCLAIMED BAG SPARKS PANIC, SECURITY DRILL

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The city airport was gripped by a bomb scare on Friday, a day after London shook from a second round of blasts, but the ending was, fortunately, not tragic.

 A handbag left behind by a woman passenger in the international lounge triggered panic, forcing the authorities to halt passenger movement for nearly an hour. Flights, however, were not disrupted. 

 The officers heaved a sigh of relief when the bag was found to contain only cash, perfume and some other items. The passenger got back the bag after paying a fine of Rs 500.

 Officials said the woman had boarded Air-India?s direct flight from London and reached Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport around 2.30 pm. She was waiting in the main lounge of the international terminal for immigration clearance and luggage. After the formalities were over, the woman, a resident of north Calcutta, left the airport, forgetting her bag in the lounge.

 It was spotted by an airport official, who notified the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF). The authorities made several announcements through the public address system, asking the owner to come forward and claim the bag. ?But as no one turned up, the security was alerted,? said an official. The area was immediately cordoned off and passengers were barred from entering the lounge.

 CISF personnel, police and the bomb disposal and fire-fighting squad were sent for. They checked the bag with bomb detectors and were convinced that it did not contain any explosives. It was then handed over to the airport manager.

 By that time, the woman returned to the airport and claimed the bag. ?It was returned to her, but only after she was made to cough up Rs 500 as fine. The small mistake caused much harassment to the security staff and passengers,? an official said. The all-clear signal was flashed around 3.30 pm.

 ?Whenever an unclaimed object is found, we conduct a security drill. We cannot afford to take chances,? said airport director B.K. Mongia. 

 According to CISF commandant Sanjay Prakash, such things happen quite frequently. ?Passengers tend to forget their handbags and briefcases. We have to check them thoroughly to ensure the safety of others,? Prakash pointed out.

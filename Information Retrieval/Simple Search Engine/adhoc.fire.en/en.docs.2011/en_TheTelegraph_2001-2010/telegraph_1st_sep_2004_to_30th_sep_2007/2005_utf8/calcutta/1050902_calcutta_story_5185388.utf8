 Delhi nod for talks on strike

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A ray of hope in ending the impasse at the Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute (SRFTI) glimmered on Thursday evening, with the central government making a move to intervene.

 During a telephone conversation with the students on strike, Afzal Amanullah, secretary, information and broadcasting (I amp;B), scheduled a tentative campus meeting on September 12.

 ?Afzal Amanullah said he was willing to come down to the SRFTI and hear us out. He also requested us to call off the strike, but we have refused to do so,? said Anirban Datta, a fourth-year student of direction, who spoke to the I amp;B official on Thursday.

 In a unanimous decision taken by all four batches of SRFTI, the main building, housing the academic and administrative wings, has been kept under lock and key for the past eight days.

 The students had decided to boycott classes till the governing council addressed their grievances, ranging from reduction of budgets to financial irregularities to lack of planning in academic schedules.

 After speaking to Amanullah, the students got in touch with SRFTI chairman and film-maker Basu Chatterjee, who must officially convene the governing council meeting.

 ?The chairman said he had already been planning to hold a meeting and would look into the matter,? said another SRFTI student.

 The practice of astrology itself is illegal. It does not appear on the government?s list of legal professions for the collection of professional tax. Delhi High Court has ruled that if one advertises a magic remedy, he can be arrested without a complaint being lodged. The amendment to the Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisement) Act 1954 makes such advertisements an unbailable offence. The IPC 420 also covers such frauds. Under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act 1940, whenever one claims a cure for a disease one has to get a licence from the directorate of drug control. Predicting improvement in health by selling gems or medallions without a licence can fetch a jail term of five to 10 years. The media allowing such things to be advertised are also culpable. With so many laws at hand, it is strange why the government does not take action. Astrologers are flourishing the most in Bengal. We had Acharya Satyananda of Barasat arrested on March 16 and Shree Jayanta caught in Bankura last Thursday.

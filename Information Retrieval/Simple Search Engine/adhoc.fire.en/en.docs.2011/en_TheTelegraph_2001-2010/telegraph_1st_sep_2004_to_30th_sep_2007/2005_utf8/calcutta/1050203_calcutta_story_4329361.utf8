 Court directs actors to patch up

 - ?Rape? case hearing adjourned till Feb. 7

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The high court on Wednesday advised actors Rudranil Ghosh and Oindrilla Chakraborty to settle their dispute through ?peaceful discussions? outside the court within the next five days.

 ?Both of you are in the same profession and know each other. You should be able to sort out your differences through discussions. The court should not interfere in the matter,? Justice Amit Talukdar observed. 

 Justice Talukdar was hearing the anticipatory bail plea moved before him by Rudranil, who was apprehending arrest in connection with a rape case lodged against him by Oindrilla. 

 Armed with an arrest order, a team of officers of Regent Park police station had raided the Academy of Fine Arts on January 14 evening. Police barged into the greenroom as soon as the play Phataru, in which Rudranil was one of the protagonists, was over. Police could not find him there.

 After the police action, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee expressed his displeasure and condemned the action. Theatre personalities, too, raised their voice against the police action in a culture centre. Deputy commissioner of police (south) Anuj Sharma had ordered an inquiry to find out if it was necessary for the policemen to raid the greenroom. 

 The judge adjourned the hearing till February 7 and gave five days? time to both the actors to mutually settle the issue. 

 ?In the meantime, the police will not arrest and harass the petitioner (Rudranil),? the court order added. 

 Oindrilla had lodged a case against Rudranil before chief judicial magistrate, Alipore, complaining that Rudranil and she lived together after he promised to marry her. But Rudranil did not marry her. She brought rape and cheating charges against him.

 Stationery makes up seizure list

 Ranajit Basu: Apart from fake CDs, what else do you seize during raids?

 Books, pencils and textbooks are only some of the other items that figure in our seizure list. We have recently seized pirated mathematics textbooks of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education, worth nearly Rs 8 lakh, and 20,000 fake pencils of a reputed brand. In addition, 30,000 exercise books have also been seized during raids. Our offices have virtually become warehouses.

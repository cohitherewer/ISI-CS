 What: The 10th anniversary celebrations of ESPN and STAR Sports.

 Where: Hyatt Regency.

 When: Friday night.

 Guest list: The high point of the evening was an appearance by cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar, who took the stage to assure Calcuttans, Dont worry, your Prince (Sourav Ganguly, of course) will be in the team to Pakistan. I dont see any problems in that at all. Good deed of the night done, he moved on to how the cable television network had revolutionised sports telecast in the country. Gavaskar took the stage shortly after the citys other sporting hero, Bhaichung Bhutia. Also present on the occasion was managing director of ESPN STAR Sports R.C. Venkatesh.

 Fashion focus: The evening started off with a fashion show featuring the autumn-winter collection of designer duo Dev and Nil. Former beauty queen Reshmi Ghosh walked the ramp along with Tollywood actresses Rimjhim Mitra and Sayantani Ghosh and city models including Sreshthaa, Pamela, Priyanka Pal, Atreyee and Sejuti.

 The show was broken up into five sequences ? Ethnic Drapes, Street Couture, Western Formals, Girl Power and Femme Fatale. Starting off with flowing saris in muted hues of yellow, green and brown, the show moved on to reveal a stylised collection of corsets paired with skirts worn over jeans. The formal line unveiled fitted silhouettes ? cigarette pants, jackets, shirts, skirts, etc ? in rich silk. The show-stealer was the finale fare: flowing gowns and cocktail dresses in white and black, with a dash of brown. 

 Weve put together the collection in a very short time, its mostly our fall-winter line. The beauty of the clothes has been enhanced by jewellery by Ina Ahluwalia, said Dev.

 E-quotient: Starting off with a fashion show, the evening unfolded a rather long entertainment menu, the highlight of which was a performance by Leslie Lewis of Colonial Cousins fame. 

 Taking the stage with his dance troupe, Leslie belted out one hit after another, starting off with the Bichhua remix and moving on to Something About The Way You Smile.

 Tantra, the nightclub at The Park, celebrated its sixth birthday on Christmas Eve by taking to the skies. The celebrations began with an early morning hot-air balloon ride with Santa and his elves on board, who showered gifts on the children invited for the bash. The celebrations culminated in The Vegas Show, a performance by dancers from Las Vegas at night (above). Pictures by Rashbehari Das 

 Go Vegas

 What: The Vegas Show.

 Where: Tantra 

 When: Saturday night.

 Show synopsis: Tantra lived up to its name by bringing down three performers from Las Vegas on Christmas Eve. The threesome ? Rachel, Jeniffer and Isabelle ? performed in Calcutta for the first time. We have been listening to tracks from Hindi movies for the past one month in preparation for this show, said the trio.

 The girls, dressed in little somethings, turned on the heat on the sixth anniversary of the popular night club. The first sequence started after midnight with the girls setting the bar top ablaze to tracks like Dont stop (Janet Jackson) and Get right (Jennifer Lopez). Up next was some Bollywood bonanza where the girls twirled to Right here right now from Bluffmaster and Kajra re from Bunty Aur Bubly. The party continued till dawn.

 Four to tango

 What: A Bollywood bonanza.

 Where: B.E.D (bars, entertainment and dining).

 When: Saturday night.

 Show synopsis: Latching on to the pulse of the party people, the night haunt on Ballygunge Circular Road flew down four Bollywood dancers from Mumbai who grooved to some of the biggest hits of 2005. Keeping them company was DJ Kiran who kept the floor crowded with tracks like Tere liye, Dus bahane and Ho jaata hai kaise.

 The draw: Besides the dancers, the decor and the food were the big attractions at B.E.D. The entire place was done up in lights with Santa tickling the funny bone and handing out gifts to revellers. 

 Song and dance are a part of every party and people end up neglecting the decor. We spent one full week doing up the place, said director, Hem Dhillon.

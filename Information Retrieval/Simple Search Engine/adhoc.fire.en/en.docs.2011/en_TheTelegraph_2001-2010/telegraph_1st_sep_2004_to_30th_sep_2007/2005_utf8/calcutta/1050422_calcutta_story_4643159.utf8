 To extend its lifestyle banking proposition, ABN Amro has just upped its style quotient.

 The launch of a new branch of the Dutch bank at CD 16, Sector I, Salt Lake, provided the perfect excuse for a fashion extravaganza, spangled with some of the biggest stars of fashion biz.

 Models Noyonika Chatterjee Singh, Tapur Chatterjee and Sheetal Mallar added high-voltage glamour to the occasion by strutting Wendell Rodricks?s stuff on Wednesday evening.

 ?ABN Amro Bank promotes lifestyle banking. Our clients trust their wealth with us and expect that the bank will treat them well. Events like these will only add to the banking experience, and the same experiment has been highly successful in Bangalore,? said Nitin Chopra, executive vice president and head (consumer banking), ABN Amro.

 This is the first time Rodricks has been involved with a show of this nature. ?It was a trifle confusing when I was first approached but I gave the nod thinking it would prove to be an opportunity to do something completely different from what I?m used to,? said the Goa-based designer.

 Rodricks offered tips on power dressing in a show that started fashionably late, as usual. White set the tone of the summer ramp with the leggy models displaying kurtis, long kameezes, cool white shirts and lungi-style wraparounds.

 The style guru was anything but conformist in his creations. ?Let your employees wear what they want. Tying them down in uncomfortable dress codes can be detrimental. If the comfort level isn?t high it might hamper output,? advised Rodricks.

 His message was clear ? experiment with colours but get rid of the herd mentality as far as the latest trends are concerned. 

 Even for front-office executives, comfort is more important than being trendy, feels Rodricks.

 The pep talk drifted to office parties as well. According to the designer, if one is attending a party thrown by the managing director of the company, giving the hostess competition by pulling out all the stops may not be the best idea. ?You might just end up being the target of her wrath,? he smiled.

 For the hostess herself, the sky, according to Rodricks, is the limit. Bright colours rule the power game, and spectators could take a cue from model Sheetal Mallar, who showed off a bright fuschia evening gown to perfection.

 ?The hostess should stand out in a crowd so she can be approached by the guests,? was the designer?s advice.

 Just when the show seemed over, the motley gathering of around 100 had an unexpected treat when Rodricks offered a sneak peek into designs he will officially unveil at Lakme India Fashion Week 2005 on Friday.

 ?The designs are titled Oceania and the theme is the tribes of islands in the Indian Ocean,? he explained. The minimalist styling is also dominated by white.

 The leisure promise of the bank extends beyond the opening night. The Bancafe concept has been extended to the centre. The branch will stay open from 7.30 pm to 11 pm, after the day?s operations are over, so patrons can browse investment options, conduct transactions and learn about the latest facilities over a cup of coffee. ?All the activities and facilities of the bank should revolve around the comfort of the consumer. The dynamics of banking have changed enormously and not keeping pace with the demands of clients would spell doom,? explained Chopra.

 Snack it to stay fit, disclose doctors

 - RESTRICTING FOOD INTAKE TO MAIN MEALS BAD FOR HEALTH

Trying hard to control your cholesterol and body weight, but failing miserably? Try snacks. More and more Calcuttans, in their effort to reduce weight and stay fit, are not eating between meals, but are ending up with high blood cholesterol, irregular blood pressure and indigestion.

 With hordes of young men and women complaining of sickness and high cholesterol despite restricting food intake only to main meals, doctors are now advising them to munch some snacks between meals.

 ?Youngsters are trying hard to stay fit, but are going wrong on the basics,? says cardiologist Shuvo Dutta. ?They are not eating anything between meals, but during lunch and dinner, they are consuming more cholesterol-rich food than what?s required. The secret to good health is less cholesterol-rich food and snacks in between meals.?

 Experts say snacks should form an important part of a healthy lifestyle as they boost energy, supplement the daily nutrient requirements, and control blood sugar and weight. 

 ?If snacks are rich in nutrients and fibre, there is some kind of variety and balance in the food one eats,? says nutritionist Saila Agarwal.

 In fact, snacks do fill in the nutrient gaps that are not met by the meals. Doctors advise that ?whole grain products? with fibre, fruits and vegetables should top the snack list. The preferred items include bananas, nuts, whole-wheat bread stuffed with vegetable, or even noodles. 

 ?We have been telling people that anything cholesterol-free should be the ideal snack, even plain noodles,? says Abhijit Banerjee, head of cardiology department at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. ?This will ensure that one does not eat more during regular meals. But, unfortunately, I keep getting plenty of patients with high cholesterol and with a history of eating only the main meals.? 

 Nutritionists recommend that dietary fibre is one snack which has many advantages. Dietary fibres found in vegetables is a complex carbohydrate that the body can neither digest nor absorb. 

 Although it is not considered a nutrient, fibre, generally referred to as ?roughage?, plays an important role in preventing constipation and regularising bowel movement. This roughage can be found in whole-grain cereals, brown breads and vegetables, among others. Fibre-rich food also helps in keeping the sugar and cholesterol levels in control.

 ?Eating snacks are the ideal way to keep yourself trim and fit. What people don?t realise is that just small meals do not help at all. We have been advising patients to try anything from fruits to plain biscuits and noodles at least three times a day,? says nutritionist Agarwal.

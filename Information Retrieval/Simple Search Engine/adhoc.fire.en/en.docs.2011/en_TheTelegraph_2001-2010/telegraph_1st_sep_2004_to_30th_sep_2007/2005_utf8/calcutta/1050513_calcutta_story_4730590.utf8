The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Small talk

 Turn on the air-conditioner full blast if you are entertaining at home. The mercury is slated to climb higher for the flavour is very filmi. Make sure you are in tune with all the glitz, the glamour and the gab?

 Love in Hollywood

 If you followed the Brad Pitt-Jennifer Aniston split closely, now is the time to pin the blame on his rumoured lover Angelina Jolie. Gloat over the gossip that claims Pitt, 41, is scouting around London for a $ 5 million house, in Jolies neighbourhood. Im sure its Angelina who rocked their boat, she looks the sort, pout and all, is the catty swipe hanging in the humid air. And Jennifer looks too much of a simpleton to know what was going on, you might add. Looks like its the season of love in Hollywood. Heard Bridget, oops Renee, tied the knot with her country-singer flame, will sit pretty on the kitty party platter as well.

 Film fiasco

 While all seems slated to last happily ever after in Hollywood (for the moment, at least), Bollywood is fishing in troubled waters yet again. Dismiss as parochial the PIL protesting the depiction of Netajis relationship and subsequent marriage with Emilie Schenkl, an Austrian national, in Benegals film Bose ? The Forgotten Hero. Cite Netajis niece-in-law and former MP Krishna Boses reaction against the PIL to drive home your point. When will audiences grow up, is a question you could ask at a gathering of film buffs.

 A tiny figure, all padded up, bat in hand. Mini mobile phones with beeping lights in blue and gold. Friendly neighbour Spiderman in blue and red. A Beyblade or a Pokemon, a Tweety or a Mickey Mouse? Not just sought-after toys, but symbols of sibling sentiments.

 With Raksha Bandhan hours away, ties that bind kids to cricket (Sachin Tendulkar) and cartoon (Spider-Man), technology (mobiles and handycams) and teddy (Beni Bear) are all reflected in rakhis.

 For, kid craze is ruling the racks this rakhi week, like never before. Gone are the days of a twisted red-and-golden thread being tied on the brother?s wrist. Friday the 19th will see boys sporting trendy ties ranging from the bold to the bizarre.

 ?Children are attracted towards rakhis that match their age and style. Those embossed with popular cartoon characters like Pokemon, Noddy, Tweety and Beyblade are definitely the flavour,? says Gautam Jatia of Landmark.

 Traditional and sober rakhis are still popular among the older set, but for the young ones, the rakhis mirroring today?s mood ? and ranging between Rs 10 and Rs 50 ? are hot.

 ?Innovative kids? rakhis are doing unquestionably well and these are definitely the star attraction,? says a spokesperson at the Raksha Bandhan counter of Pantaloons, on Camac Street.

 One look at the counter and you find innovation redefined, with the Jassi Jaissi Koi Nahin rakhi enjoying pride of place along with the Sachin Tendulkars and Spidermans. The price tag stretches from Rs 5 to Rs 100.

 ?Raksha Bandhan is also no longer only about brothers. This year, a lot of people are going in for lumbas that serve as rakhis for sisters-in-law,? adds the spokesperson.

 Other popular Raksha Bandhan shop stops are also out to pamper the little ones. 

 Jostling for attention among rakhis embellished with sequins and zardosi work is the chocolate rakhi and the cartoon character rakhis at Archies, City Centre.

 But here, the traditional rakhi is holding its own against the toon tirade of the times. ?The sober variety always finds its takers, but there is a growing section going in for the fancy ones,? says Gautam Shroff of Archies.

 Tradition is also the theme at the Nik Nish outlet, on Camac Street. 

 Rakhis with roli and chawal in pretty baskets stand out in the crowd of gimmicks.

 ?Roli and chawal are auspicious for the festival and a lot of people are still going in for these motifs,? says a spokesperson for the store.

 But the roli and chawal share rack space with the cats, the teddy bears and the cartoon heroes at Nik Nish, too.

 At Metro Plaza, rakhis with artificial stones, Handycam rakhis, mobile rakhis, wooden rakhis and simple rakhis with colourful beads co-exist.

 ?Fancy rakhis are definitely in and unique is the mantra. Whether old or young, buyers want to add that extra edge to their occasion of Raksha Bandhan by making fashionable and trendy buys,? explains a spokesperson from Metro Plaza.

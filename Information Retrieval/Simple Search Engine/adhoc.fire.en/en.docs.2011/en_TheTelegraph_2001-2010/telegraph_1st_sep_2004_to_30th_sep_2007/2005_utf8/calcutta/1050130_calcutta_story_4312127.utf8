The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Of menu matters and mood swings

 Nilanjanaa

Metro on Sunday and Nilanjanaa thank readers 

for flooding us with queries. Here?s the first set of answers:

You mentioned in one of your articles that chicken 

bones should not be fed to dogs. Why? (Sulakshna)

Chicken bones when chewed have sharp edges (splinters). 

Splintered chicken bones may puncture a dog?s gastrointestinal tract, causing 

deadly toxins to be released into the stomach. Alternatively, the splintered chicken 

bone can injure the oesophagus. The primary concern: a small chicken bone not 

chewed up could be a potential choking problem. Cooked chicken bones should never 

be fed, as these are very brittle.

My husband and I are both out of the house on work 

and both our dogs remain confined the whole day. My husband walks the dogs every 

morning and every night. Of late, the two have become aggressive, fight amongst 

themselves and don?t eat properly? 

Dogs are social animals, very active and with loads 

of energy. When they are confined to the house they not only get a feeling of 

isolation but also don?t know what to do with so much surplus energy. This often 

takes the form of aggressive behaviour. Not eating could be due to health reasons 

(check with your vet) but it could also be to express displeasure at being left 

alone at home. Please make sure there?s a domestic help at home to walk them and 

keep them company. And try spending quality time with them.

I want to volunteer and work for animal protection 

in some way. Who can I contact? (Md. Kushaal) 

You can become a volunteer with any of these NGOs 

working for stray animals in Calcutta. PFA: 24239100/24239101/21035556/21035558.

re-house abandoned pets/homeless animals. Most importantly, you can spread awareness

My dog suffers from acute skin problems. As a result 

of which he?s losing hair in patches. (Ashok Mukherjee)

For my dog, I found the local application of Escabiol 

Emulsion very effective. You could also use a paste of Neem oil and Scabileo leo 

(Ayurvedic medicine for dogs). This paste should be applied in the opposite direction 

of the hair growth. Dabur, Himalayan Drugs and Indian Immunologicals have launched 

a number of Ayurvedic drugs for canines. You could check them out. Also make sure 

you use a shampoo meant for dogs and not for humans. Consult your vet if your 

dog continues to show external symptoms including reddish, white and grey skin, 

or a skin that tends to peel and scale easily.

 Gift garb in ceramic

 ANUMITA GHOSH

 Add an extra edge to your gift by tucking it in a colourful ceramic basket, instead of wasting time with single-use wrapping paper and handmade-paper bags.

 Coming in a variety of delightful shapes and hues, these shiny ceramic holders can come in handy on occasions when you want to lend a special touch to the perfect present.

 The shoe-shaped baskets in pale pink and blue, for instance, are the perfect size to hold knick-knacks for your friends as are the ones fashioned in the shape of a leaf.

 A range of baskets in the conventional shape are dressed up in vibrant mauve, with little white birds all over them.

 If you have an elaborate spread picked out for your significant other, opt for heart-shaped baskets or those embellished with heart motifs.

 The striking combination of black and white with red hearts is sure to do the trick on Valentines Day or anniversaries. The heart-shaped variety also comes in soothing combinations of pink, mauve and yellow.

There are cheerful designs for youngsters as well. Load up your chocolates of choice into a basket bearing a lion grinning away or an angel waiting with wand poised for action. 

 Motifs of butterflies and flowers add to the colourful look. 

 From dry fruits to sweets and trinkets, these baskets can be used to pack in a variety of goodies. These add a lot of value to your gifts, explains a spokesperson for Nik Nish on Camac Street.

 Besides holding gifts, the baskets can sit pretty on your dressing table loaded with baubles and small vials of make up. The bigger ones can also be used as fruit baskets for the dining table or kitchen.

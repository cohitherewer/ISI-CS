 Wax work wonders

 MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA

 The Complete Book of Candles is a delightful book packed with surprisingly simple ideas to decorate a home with the items which are all the rage at the moment. Even better, the book on creative candle-making, candleholders and decorative displays, by Gloria Nicol, also demonstrates how to make your own candles. Or if that doesnt interest you, put to use the handy tips on how to personalise the store-bought variety.

 Beautiful colour photographs capture the magic candles can create accompanied by even the most inexpensive of accessories. Float them, hang them or arrange them amidst flowers (fresh, dried or even fake), fruit, seashells or stones.

 The book illustrates just how dramatically the colour ? vibrant or subtle ? of these creations can be used as an innovative tool in hospitality or festivity. 

 Like for Easter, the author suggests egg-shaped candles. Shells have been used as the base for candles, filled with wax and a wick, an idea that can be given a desi twist during Diwali.

 They can be used to decorate any space, public or intimate ? front door or back garden, dining room or bedroom.

 The book has easy-to-follow instructions about how to make your own candles at home. If some of the items needed prove hard to procure locally, you can use the basic concepts modified for what is available in the market.

 And if making candles of your own seems a task too cumbersome, there are suggestions on how to personalise candles that are brilliant in their simplicity. Cinnamon sticks and bay leaves, papier mache and salt dough are some easy raw materials that can be used to dress up basic wax pieces or fashion candleholders.

 And at just Rs 495 (available at Crossword bookstore), it is a steal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Striking it rich

 Her debut feature film Raju Uncle hasn?t released 

yet, but Sayantani Ghosh is on to her second and third projects. 

 And all three opposite Tollywood?s leading man. The model-turned-actress is currently busy shooting for Sujit Guha?s Nayak, where she plays Prosenjit?s ?love interest?. 

?I am a journalist in this film and there?s Swastika 

Mukherjee as my co-star,? says she. Up next week is the Saregama production, Ekar 

Sansar, directed by Haranath Chakraborty and co-starring Jisshu Sengupta besides 

Prosenjit, of course. 

 Mr amp; Mrs Smith: Time to run

Smith saga

 It doesn?t matter if they are going around in real 

life, they are too hot to handle on reel. In and as Mr amp; Mrs Smith, 

Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie simply sizzle as legendary assassins working for 

competing organisations. 

 Directed by Doug Liman and opening in June, Mr amp; Mrs Smith is a sexy, action-packed thrill ride about the bored married couple John and Jane ? just an ordinary suburban twosome until the secret identities are revealed.

Apart from Pitt and Jolie, the film boasts of ?the 

year?s best car chase? and Vince Vaughan in a hilarious extended cameo. Wait for 

the Smiths to arrive soon at a theatre near you.

Leader board

 The voting for this year?s STAR Parivaar Awards ? 

the most watched show on the small screen ? is on in full swing. Into Day V and 

Hiten Tejwani (Karan in Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi) and Gauri Pradhan 

(Nandini in Kyunki?) are leading in the Favourite Pati and Favourite Patni 

categories.

 In the Favourite Khalnayak category, Akashdeep (Ansh Gujral in Kyunki?) is way ahead of Chetan Hansraj (Sasha in Kahani Ghar Ghar Ki) and Vikas Sethi (Swayam in Kahiin To Hoga). Surprisingly, Ansh has been killed long back in the serial while others are very much alive and scheming.

 The Naya Sadasya category has Mona Vasu leading in and as Miilee while Ali Asgar (Kamal in Kahani?) and Shilpa Saklani (Ganga in Kyunki?) are leading in the Favourite Devar and Devarani categories. You can, of course, change the leader board by SMSing ?Award? to 7827.

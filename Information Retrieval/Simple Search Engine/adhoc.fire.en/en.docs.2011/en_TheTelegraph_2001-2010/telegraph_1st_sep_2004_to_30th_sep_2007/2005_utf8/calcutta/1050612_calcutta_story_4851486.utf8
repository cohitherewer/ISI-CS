 Heal and have fun in the lap of nature

 CLUB SANDWICH

 A view of Vedic 

 Village 

 Spinach salad with sesame seeds, 

 methi saag and plantain bharta, sprouted moong soup 

 and mushroom casserole... You can now get your dose of wellness 

 diet while chilling club class. Not greasy portions of chicken 

 butter masala or large helpings of rich, cheesy bakes, but 

 brown breads and root fibres, high-mineral rock salts and 

 dry papaya seeds instead of black pepper. 

 In sync with its heal-and-have-fun 

 motto, the focus at the leisure lair of the Vedic Village 

 resort-cum-club is very much a wholesome, health-oriented 

 cuisine, as opposed to the regular fare at any popular city 

 social club. ?Most of our vegetables, wheat and the Badshabhog 

 rice are grown on campus and the aim is to provide to members 

 and guests high-fibre, low-fat food,? stresses M.J. Robertson, 

 CEO, lifestyle division, Sanjeevani Group, developers of 

 the unique back-to-nature property on Rajarhat Road, a 20-minute 

 drive from the airport.

 So, the chapathis are made from 

 soya or whole-wheat flour and food in general is steamed 

 or tossed in cold-press oil. Ground spices are never used 

 and the property?s F amp;B committee ?takes great pains? 

 to procure unprocessed spices.

 Not just fresh lime soda, but 

 concoctions like lime juice with rock salt, mint and brahmi 

 drinks are encouraged, as are home-grown carrots, beans, 

 radish and corn. ?We also use a lot of anti-oxidants like 

 wheat-grass and lemongrass,? adds Robertson.

 While the predominant organic 

 element in the diet plays a key role in the structured ayurveda, 

 wellness and detox packages at the resort-club, there?s 

 much more to Vedic than its ripe recipes. Take a stroll 

 on the walkways, ride a horse or a bullock cart or pedal 

 a cycle-rickshaw.

 The stress is on outdoor activities 

 like flying a kite, walking along herbs or discovering the 

 water, ?at your own pace?. The morning yoga classes are 

 also attended by the resort?s general manager and the doctors 

 of the therapeutic Sanjeeva Spa, housed within.

 And most of those having used 

 the health spa, vouch for the effectiveness of its therapies. 

 ?I came here to receive ayurvedic treatment for my chest 

 troubles and after having gone through it, I feel largely 

 benefited,? painter Paritosh Sen writes in the comments 

 register.

 ?The doctors? thorough, systematic 

 approach, emphasis on patient education and regard for patient 

 autonomy have won my complete confidence. I compliment their 

 approach of addressing the root cause of the disease as 

 opposed to merely treating symptoms,? writes a student.

 With the existing 40 rooms and 

 25 farmhouses running at ?90 per cent occupancy even during 

 summer?, the management has slipped into expansion mode. 

 ?We are targeting 150 rooms and 12 ethnic villas in the 

 form of mud-houses by this winter,? declares Robertson.

 With a trip to the North American 

 Bengali Conference at Madison Square Gardens, New York City 

 planned as well, the international marketing has begun in 

 earnest. Vedic, keen to position itself as an international 

 resort-tourism destination, is also going to the UK to scout 

 for travel partners.

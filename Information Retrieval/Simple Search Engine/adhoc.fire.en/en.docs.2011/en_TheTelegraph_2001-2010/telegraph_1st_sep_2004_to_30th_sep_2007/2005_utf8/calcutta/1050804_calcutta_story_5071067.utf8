 Factory booty recovered

 - Pre-dawn swoop by police leads to arrest of eight

 A STAFF REPORTER

 In a pre-dawn swoop on Wednesday, the city police arrested eight persons in Calcutta and South 24-Parganas for robbing raw material for coil manufacturing from a factory on Taratala Road.

 The cops later raided two warehouses on Lenin Sarani and in Maniktala to recover the robbed goods, worth Rs 25 lakh. A truck used in the robbery was also impounded.

 According to police, a group of 12 men, carrying firearms and bhojalis, descended on the Taratala factory early on July 30. They scaled the boundary wall of the unit to enter the premises.

 The men overpowered two security guards ? Anil Singh and Shaligram Singh ? and locked them up in a room. They then broke open the padlock of the main factory gate to let in the truck. They looted about five tonnes of copper plates, wire and armatures, before speeding off.

 Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner (I), detective department, said: ?Soon after taking charge of the investigation, officers of the dacoity wing of the detective department found out that the robbers were from two villages in Basanti ? a remote pocket in South 24-Parganas.?

 Armed with the information, a team of officers headed for Basanti late on Tuesday.

 ?The first raid was carried out at Boro Kala Hajra village. After walking a few kilometres and crossing a river and several canals, the officers reached the hamlet. Three persons ? identified as Jote Fakir, Saifuddin Laskar and Alauddin Mollah ? were arrested in their houses,? said an officer.

 The cops then proceeded to the adjoining village, Chhoto Kala Hajra. Three more men ? Taahir Ali, Asgar Gazi and Sambhu Bera ? were rounded up from there.

 ?We brought all six back to the Lalbazar police headquarters and started interrogating them. In due course, they broke down and confessed that they were involved in the robbery,? added the officer. ?They told us that the booty was passed on to a person residing in Keshub Sen Street.?

 Based on the leads provided by the arrested men, the sleuths raided a warehouse in Maniktala and arrested two others ? Narendra Nath Das, the driver of the impounded truck, and Sadek Ali.

 The major portion of the stolen goods was recovered from the warehouse. The truck was also impounded there.

 Interrogation of the arrested duo yielded further information about the robbery that lead to the subsequent raid in another warehouse on Lenin Sarani. The rest of the booty was recovered from there.

 Shop heist: Three armed men looted a shop in Baruipur on Wednesday. They tied up the owner and his help before fleeing with cash and goods. No arrests have been made.

 CAT amp; mouse mind games

 More than anything else, the Common Admission Test is a test of nerves. 

 Here rsquo;s an analysis of this year rsquo;s posers and pitfalls

 CAT is often referred to as the toughest management entrance exam in the world. Most of the estimated 1.7 lakh students who took the test, with a changed format and reduced choice of questions, on November 20 would agree.

 Vidur Kapoor, director, Erudite Educational Centre, is one with them on the issue. ?CAT is the gateway to the cream of management institutes in India, the IIMs, which offer only 1,350 seats,? he explains.

 This year, the exam was conducted amidst tight security. And it threw up its share of surprises. The total number of questions were reduced from 123 to 90. The absence of Data Sufficiency questions, often perceived to be a simple section, confused a large number of students.

 Kapoor said, ?The format left students with limited choice. Very little strategy could be applied in selecting the easiest questions. This was mainly because the students managed to read through all the questions. Ultimately, it boiled down to how many he or she managed to solve.?

 Kapoor and his team have come up with an analysis of CAT 2005. For the Verbal Ability section, the Erudite team is of the opinion that a student could have attempted at least 10 to 12 questions. ?One could have attempted the sentence completion and the questions on vocabulary, as they were on the easier side. This would have ensured 10 marks,? says Kapoor. In the Reading Comprehension section, the students could have attempted at least six to seven questions, as the passage on psychology was simple.

 However, the passage on literature being tougher, only two questions could have been attempted on it. The questions on economics required some amount of analysis and only two out of the four questions could have been attempted.

 In the Quantitative Aptitude section, Kapoor says that at least 13 to 16 questions could have been attempted, if selected properly. In the Data Interpretation section, which is regarded as the toughest of the lot, ?certain questions would have been very difficult to solve under the time constraint and pressure?. The examinees could have solved 12 to 14 questions in this section, Kapoor says.

 The IIMs will mail the scorecards by early January. Each sectional score is given in the form of percentile and percentage scores. The percentile gives an idea of one?s position amongst the total number of students sitting for CAT. For example, if a student is in the 99th percentile, it means that he or she is in the top one per cent of the candidates appearing for CAT. The percentage score, on the other hand, is the percentage scored in comparison with the highest score obtained in the section.

 Kapoor says: ?On the basis of the CAT performance, one should shortlist the institutes to apply to. Those who have relatively weak communication skills should definitely start preparing for the group discussions and personal interviews.?

 Kapoor has a few words of wisdom for CAT 2006 aspirants. The Quantitative Aptitude section is seeing a gradual change in focus from arithmetic to topics like number systems, geometry and algebra, he points out. The Data Interpretation section has seen a radical shift this year, from calculative graphs with closed options to logical graphs based on reasoning. ?CAT 2005 was a shock for quite a few who had prepared extensively for large calculations,? Kapoor adds.

 Besides being an academic test, CAT is also a test of nerves. The pressure is the same for all students, whether they show it or not. The right attitude and positive thinking are what count.

 Festive zing

 Not one at Umang ?05 complained about the nip in the November air. And why would they, given that the annual fest organised in association with The Telegraph, featured some of the hottest events in the college circuit in the recent past.

 Umang ?05 has come a long way since it started in 2002. True to its slogan ?You dream it, we theme it?, the fest this year was not short of entertainment. The sheer variety of events was mind-boggling. More than 50 colleges participated in the fiesta, that started on November 14.

 On the very first day, DJ Sid from Delhi kicked off the party in style with the audience swaying to his remixes. Up next was a medley of entertainers like Street Play, Production House, War of VJs and Mock Parliament. The finals of many of these contests were held the following day. The Fashion Show and War of Rappers on Day Three were the real crowd-pullers.

 A cricket match was organised on the 19th, a day after a cultural meet at Kala Mandir. DJ Suketu rocked the crowd on November 20 at RCGC, bringing the curtains down on the annual affair.

 The hosts bagged the best college honours and the first prize in dance and War of DJs.

 Perhaps, more than a fest, the event was a lesson in creativity and would inspire us to present an even better ensemble next year.

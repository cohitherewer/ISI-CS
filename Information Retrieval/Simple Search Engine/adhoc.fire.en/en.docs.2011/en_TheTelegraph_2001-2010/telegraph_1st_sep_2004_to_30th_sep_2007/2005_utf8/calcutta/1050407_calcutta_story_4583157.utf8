The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 World furniture at the door

 - Home improvement products from Denmark in end-April debut

 SUBHRO SAHA

 A Wenge ? dark brown coffee shade ? bed with slanting head-boards, sliding wardrobe with sand-blasted finish or do-it-yourself building-blocks to play around with.

 The latest international trends in home improvement products will be available here and now in a couple of weeks, as the ?world?s largest manufacturer of domestic furniture? comes to town. Attitude, opening its doors at 7/1A, Loudon Street shortly into the Bengali New Year, will showcase the best from the stable of Tvilum-Scanbirk A/S, the Denmark-based global leader, which feeds such iconic brands as IKEA, Home Depot and B amp;Q.

 ?Calcutta will house the flagship store of the chain and we are looking at 50 outlets all over the country in the next two years,? announces Gaurav Goenka of the Kitply family, CEO amp; customer companion, Universal Specialities Ltd, owners of the Attitude brand.

 That Calcutta figures high on the places-to-be list ? following a soft launch in Gurgaon ? is no surprise, given the furniture fact that the Style Spa Camac Street store is the highest-grossing single outlet in the country, totting up monthly sales worth Rs 35-40 lakh.

 The ?well-developed automation and, hence, competitiveness on price? of its Danish collaborators will enable Attitude to be 20 per cent cheaper than competition, Goenka claims. Tvilum-Scanbirk?s five fully automated furniture factories in Denmark and one in the US produce 12 million items of furniture annually, with two new designs created every day. More than 90 per cent of the $ 400 m-turnover company?s production is exported to 70 countries across the world.

 All the pieces ? bedroom sets and wardrobes, kitchen solutions and accessories ? will be shipped from Denmark in a knockdown, ready-to-assemble state. ?We will also have a design centre-cum-room planner in-store to advise the consumer,? says Goenka.

 While new veneers like oak and Wenge will be launched, local favourites like light cherry and beach will also adorn the display docks. ?As India is joining the WTO and duties go down, we think it?s necessary to have a retail presence there,? says Ole Lund Andersen, managing director of the Danish furniture giant, from Copenhagen.

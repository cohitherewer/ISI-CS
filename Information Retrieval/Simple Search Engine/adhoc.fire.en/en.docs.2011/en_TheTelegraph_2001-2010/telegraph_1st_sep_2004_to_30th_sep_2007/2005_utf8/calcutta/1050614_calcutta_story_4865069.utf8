 Anurag Kashyap: Word wizard

 You probably read about how this 13-year-old correctly spelt the word ?appoggiatura? (a musical grace note) to win the prestigious 78th Scripps National Spelling Bee in Washington. Now you can catch Anurag Kashyap in the act by tuning in to the finals of the Spelling Bee Championship on ESPN. The initial round will be beamed on June 14 at 5.30 pm and the finals on June 15 at 5.30 pm.

 Anurag beat kids from over 200 different communities in the US to seal his win in the 19th round of the finals, winning a total of $22,000 in cash, a $5,000 college scholarship, a set of encyclopaedia and a $1,000 savings bond, among other prizes. He is an avid reader and a straight-A student. Anurag recently participated in state-level Mathcounts and Science Olympiad competitions and also represented his school in the California Geographic Bee.

 Spelling Bee is America?s largest and longest-running promotional event on education, run on a not-for-profit basis by The E.W. Scripps Company and over 260 sponsors in the US, Europe, Canada, New Zealand, Guam, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, The Bahamas and American Samoa.

 UNICEF has come up with a local adaptation of it?s child rights campaign, with Meena making her first appearance on a Bengali channel. A series of short films aimed at creating awareness, based on its world-famous character Meena, a little girl who is curious, hardworking and trustworthy, will be screened. 

 An 11-episode serial based on her life will be broadcast on Bangla Akhon. The interactive sessions will have Meena?s real-life friends (all school students), voicing their fears, joys and sorrows, and claiming their rights to survival, development, protection and participation. 

 On June 11, the framework for the Meena project was drawn up, with children and adults working together. June 12 was the first day of shooting, which will continue. The show will be telecast at 5 pm every Monday.

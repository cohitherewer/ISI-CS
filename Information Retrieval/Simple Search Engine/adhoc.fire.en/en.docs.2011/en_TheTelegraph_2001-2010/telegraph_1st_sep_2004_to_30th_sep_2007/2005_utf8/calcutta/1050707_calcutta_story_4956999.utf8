The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Ringo Starr 

When you speak, others pause to listen. You are gentle and romantic, but with sharp business sense. You are original in your approach to things. Material and mental satisfaction help you enjoy life. You have an inherent knack for art, though you may not use it often. You are fond of films, picnics and other sources of fun. ? Kusum Bhandari

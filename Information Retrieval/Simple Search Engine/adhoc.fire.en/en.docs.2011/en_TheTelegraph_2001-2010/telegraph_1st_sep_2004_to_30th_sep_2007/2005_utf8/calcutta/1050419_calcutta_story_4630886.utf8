 Hi-tech edge for cancer institute

 A STAFF REPORTER

 From a 260-bed cancer hospital to one with a special children?s wing and now, the first-ever hi-tech linear accelerator in eastern India, Cancer Centre Welfare Home and Research Institute in Thakurpukur has come a long way.

 The Primus K 15 MV Medical Linear Accelerator will help in the treatment of tumours deep-seated in the human body without affecting the normal body tissues.

 ?The beam edge of the linear accelerator recently installed in the hospital is very sharp. With the help of the machine, we will be able to treat cancer patients using high-precision radiation,? Saroj Gupta, founder-secretary of the institute, said on Monday.

 A new building has also been constructed on the hospital premises. It houses 30 beds for cancer patients, in addition to the linear accelerator. The bill for both came to approximately Rs 6.5 lakh.

 ?The linear accelerator has been installed and we are conducting a trial run. In about three weeks? time, we should be able to make the unit fully operational,? Gupta observed.

 The new building, which has been specifically constructed to set up the linear accelerator, has five-ft-thick concrete walls. All kinds of facilities will be provided for patients from far-flung areas in the new ward, Gupta added.

 The use of special high-energy electronic beams for treatment of cancer of the breast, lip, skin, head and neck is another first offered by the institute in Calcutta.

 The hospital is set to offer advanced imaging facilities. Nuclear medicine and advanced pathology departments are also in the offing.

 The institute has been facing stiff competition from a number of cancer speciality centres around the city and its outskirts.

 Apart from Medical College and Hospital, which has one of the oldest cancer units in Asia, other state-run hospitals like NRS Medical College and Hospital and SSKM Hospital have procured state-of-the-art machines for improvement in cancer care.

 According to an unofficial estimate, over 60,000 cancer cases are reported in the state every year. Keeping the number of cancer patients in mind, the government recently decided to upgrade cancer research facilities in the state-run hospitals.

 Private hospitals, including Ruby General Hospital and AMRI Hospitals, are also starting special cancer units.

 ?Ours is the best private cancer research facility. The prices we offer are affordable and we have a rich history in treating cancer patients. So, healthy competition is always welcome,? Gupta said.

 The institute employs 10 radiation oncologists, five medical physicists trained at the Bhaba Atomic Research Centre, and 20 technicians.

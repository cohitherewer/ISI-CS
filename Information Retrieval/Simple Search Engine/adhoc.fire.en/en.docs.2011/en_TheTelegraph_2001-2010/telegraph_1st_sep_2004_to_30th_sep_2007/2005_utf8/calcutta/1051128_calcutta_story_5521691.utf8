 Get set

 From a functional accessory to a winter style essential, shawls are as hot as they get, says Shradha Agarwal

 Jeans, skirts, saris and suits? Whatever the outfit may be, a shawl covers up as the perfect accessory, and sometimes more. As designer Sayon Mitra puts it, Shawls are no longer accessories, they are garments in themselves.

 Drape it, pin it, throw it on or simply clip it up. Create a stunning look, each time, as different as the previous one?

 Presenting the GoodLife guide to making the most of your stylish shawl.

 Denim drape

 Designer Preeti Jhawar attributes the versatility of shawls to their availability in various shapes and sizes. Narrow stoles look funky when teamed with denims and tightened as a belt, she says.

 Around the waist, as headgear or just taken as a wrap, shawls have certainly come a long way from their aunty-appeal days. 

 Sayon offers a sexy drape to be paired with denims. Throw a pashmina with faux fur trimmings like a jacket on your shoulders. Cross the two folds on each other and clip it together with a brooch, near the bust line. An ornate brooch can easily substitute for a piece of jewellery too. 

 The classic blue jeans and white shirt look can also get an all-new twist with just the toss of a stole or shawl.

 Dress up this eternal combo with a dash of colour and spunky style. An antique jamewar will look very elegant with your denims, but if you are in the mood for some experimental fun, try cool weaves, stripes and polka dots.

 Last year saw a rage of sequinned shawls, and this year the spotlight is on fringing.

 A solid colour pashmina can be made exciting with some add-ons like vibrant pom-poms, leather fringing or beaded tassels. Wear it differently so that the drape emphasises the details, explains Manju Hada of Sumeru India, a shawl export house. 

 Poncho pick

 Did you know that the ponchos you have been flaunting for the past year-and-a-half actually had a humble shawl origin?

 This fashionable, feminine garment that flooded the markets in chiffon and georgette really began as a hole in the middle of a rough shawl. 

 A shawl because it had to ward off the cold winter and a large hole simply to facilitate arm movement during long journeys.

 Come winter and enter ponchos once again ? in all shapes and sizes.

 Even if you dont want to cut up your shawl and convert it into a poncho, draping could give it the desired effect. You could just pin it up on the shoulders and under the sleeves to resemble a poncho, offers Manju.

 So, all you need for poncho points are a few large pins and a whole lot of attitude.

 Ethnic effect

 Shawls have always complemented the Indian look perfectly, but today the manner is indeed very modern. Pashminas and jamewars are anyway so regal and elegant that they look gorgeous with just about anything, says Sayon.

 Wear it with a sari or with a salwar kurta to replace your summery dupatta. Another option is to drape a shawl like a sari. For this style, all you need to do is pleat the entire sari and then introduce a shawl as the pallu. Tuck one free end of the shawl at the waist and drape it like a pallu. 

 Nowadays people want drama in their ensembles. Draping the shawl like a pallu looks very unpredictable and catchy, says Preeti. 

 The season is ruled by vintage hues, by and large, hence Preeti picks traditional Kashmiri shawls as the best ethnic bet to go with saris. Baluchari shawls are another favour-ite, adds this young designer.

 So, this winter take a new look at that old shawl!

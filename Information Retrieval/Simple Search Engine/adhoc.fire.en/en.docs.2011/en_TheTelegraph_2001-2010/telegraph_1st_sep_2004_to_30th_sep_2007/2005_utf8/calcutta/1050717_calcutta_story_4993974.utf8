The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Ring of status or utility

Analysing the two AirTel ads that send out mixed signals 

to two categories of cell phone users

Shiloo Chattopadhyay

You 

have possibly seen these two ads from AirTel. One enacts a drama in a paan 

shop and the backdrop of the other theatre is a hair-dressing saloon. Both 

promote usage of mobile phones amongst the less privileged, thanks to the Rs 200 

per month price tag. You may be wondering why they deserve to intrude into your 

Sunday morning.

True, these are not path-breaking ads by any stretch 

of imagination. Nor are they embedded with visible creative brilliance. Yet, these 

ads are interesting as case studies in marketing communication. Most serious advertising 

debates in our country are held in private. The knowledge bank of marketing thus 

remains under nourished. A soap maker has little opportunity to learn from the 

mistakes of a refrigerator seller. Hence this discussion in Ad Lib.

The intention of these two TV commercials from AirTel 

is explicit: to announce their affordable pricing. The aim is to penetrate into 

a segment that may have so far thought that mobile phones are too expensive. The 

very extreme of the urban middle class is being wooed.

Shankar, my friendly neighbourhood ?presswala? 

does not use a mobile phone. The moot point is, is it because he cannot afford 

the monthly expense? One has to wonder whether he can afford the price of a handset 

? likely to be a four-figure sum even in the second-hand market. Is that a tougher 

hurdle to cross? At the upper end, a marketing duet between the airtime sellers 

and handset makers is visible. How come they were not brought into play at this 

end, where it may be more critically required?

users

Even on the issue of monthly bills, the lure that 

incoming calls are free is possibly tenuous. The proponents say that the trick 

is to only receive calls and not make too many. This target segment tends to interact, 

understandably, within their class. So somebody from this echelon has to make 

the calls. Everyone cannot be just receiving it. Is it then a bait only to acquire 

the customer and the hope is that the habit will take care of his continuance?

There is this roadside food-stall outside a housing 

complex. The owner bought a mobile phone to accept orders from the residents through 

SMS. He saw a tremendous surge in his business post this arrangement. Now he owns 

five mobile connections. There is enough empirical evidence to suggest that at 

the lower end of our social strata, utility is a stronger draw than pure pleasure 

or social value.

In their drama, both the AirTel ads have chosen to 

stoke only the irrational desire of owning a mobile. Utility does not get a look 

in. Is there a hint of sub-optimality here? Indeed that question is relevant in 

another dimension. The ads were shown several times during the recently telecast 

Natwest challenge matches on ESPN. To the best of my knowledge, Shankar my neighbourhood 

?presswala? is not too keen on cricket when India is not playing.

Finally, there is a flip side that is even scarier. 

Mobile phone ownership is still evolving in this country. In the upper strata, 

their ownership remains a status symbol, their utility a rationalisation. 

These two ads, perhaps unwittingly, dilutes the social 

value of owning a mobile. In fact, these ads may discourage us, the image seekers. 

More crucially, they may make many of us believe that not owning a mobile is socially 

distinctive!

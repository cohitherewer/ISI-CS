 People to decide pool future

 Tanmoy Bhattacharya: A newly-built swimming pool on a Southern Avenue boulevard is an eyesore. It causes problems for the elderly as it has come up blocking the pavement. Can?t you demolish it?

 I have seen it. I don?t know whose brainchild it was and what prompted the previous Trinamul board to pour the hard-earned money of taxpayers down the drain. If people want the pool demolished, we will have to do that. But demolition means a loss of a huge sum of money. We must see first whether we can utilise the pool for the benefit of the people.

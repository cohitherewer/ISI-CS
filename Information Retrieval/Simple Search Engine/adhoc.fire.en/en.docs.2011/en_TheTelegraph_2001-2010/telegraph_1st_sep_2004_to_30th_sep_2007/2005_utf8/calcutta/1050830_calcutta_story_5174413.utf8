 Till the last ball is bowled

 When Nagesh Kukunoor gave up his job of a chemical engineer to make movies, he couldn?t have imagined that seven years later, his film?s premiere would be one of the most attended events in Bollywood. Last Wednesday, when Iqbal was shown at Fame Adlabs (Andheri), the who?s who of the film fraternity turned up to congratulate Kukunoor on what is his first foray into Hindi-language cinema.

 Thanks to Subhash Ghai?s new Mukta Searchlight Films banner flying high in the backdrop, most of his friends in the industry dropped in to catch the feel-good film. So there was Dilip Kumar himself with wife Saira Banu. Bollywood?s new-age directors like Raj Kumar Hirani and Vishal Bharadwaj were spotted. Also seen were Javed Akhtar, Meenakshi Sheshadri, Satish Kaushik and Suniel Shetty. There was a buzz that Shah Rukh Khan would drop in ? knowing his association with Ghai ? but it remained only a buzz.

 The real attraction of the premiere was M.F. Hussain, who made an entire series of paintings inspired by the film. His Iqbal collection was displayed in the foyer and was the evening?s food for thought over cheeseballs and beer.

 ?It is such an inspirational film ki mujhe laga ki main kuch banaun...,? said Hussain even as he kept congratulating Shreyas Talpade (who plays Iqbal in the film) for his brilliant performance.

 Also moved by the film was Javed Akhtar. ?It?s such a simple film, yet so effective,? he said. ?The new guy (Shreyas) has done an incredible job. The second half, though, could have been made a little tighter. But the film is really well made and the songs and background score are very good.?

 No man was more active on the night than Mr Ghai himself. Giving quotable quotes to every camera around, welcoming his guests and also introducing his Iqbal team ? the showman was all over the place.

 ?Nagesh has made such a sweet film. We immediately connected when he came up with the idea of an 18-year-old deaf and mute village boy dreaming of making it to the Indian cricket team.?

 For Kukunoor, formerly restricted mostly to the festivals, it was a different experience altogether to be under the bright filmi spotlight. ?I am happy that so many people are coming in to watch the kind of films I make. SG?s (Ghai) banner has certainly made things easier, especially in the promotion and marketing.?

 It?s probably not a coincidence that Kukunoor?s big dream of making a popular film came true through the on-screen achievement of Iqbal?s big dream.

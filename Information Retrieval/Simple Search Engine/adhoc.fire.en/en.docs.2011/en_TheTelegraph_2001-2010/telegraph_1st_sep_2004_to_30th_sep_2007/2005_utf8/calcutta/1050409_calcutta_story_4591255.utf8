The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Online market for firms, students 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 If bagging a job is difficult, getting the right kind of people for the assignments is no less an ordeal.

 Realising the problems faced by recruiters and potential employees, recruitment service provider eLitmus.Com has floated a ?virtual and just? marketplace for companies and candidates. 

 ?The objective is to save time and other resources for both parties and evolve a technology-driven fair and just system for recruitment,? said Aseem Marwaha, managing director of the Bangalore-headquartered fledgling company. 

 At the centre of this system will be the pH test, to be held once a month in 11 cities across the country, for final-year graduation students and people with less than two years? work experience. 

 The company is promoting the test both among the student fraternity and the corporate sector across the country, but West Bengal is a very strategic market for eLitmus. 

 ?Companies are interested in coming to Calcutta as it is perceived that talent is in abundance here. That?s why we think the concept of pH test will help the people here,? explained Marwaha. 

 From computing ability to language skills ? the test will evaluate some of the basic skills of students. The first test will be conducted on April 24 and students can sit for the test by paying Rs 475 as registration fee.

 ?The system is developed keeping in mind the freshers and the scores will be available on our site for the companies and the candidates to refer and use,? said Marwaha. Fifty-three companies ? like Dell Computers, GE, eFunds, Virtusa and Chembiotek ? have already tied up with the system. 

 To begin with, eLitmus ? a 100 per cent subsidiary of Browse Consulting, one of the leading headhunting companies ? will focus on recruitment in four sectors, software, non-voice business process outsourcing, life sciences and banking and finance. According to the company?s conservative estimates, more than five million entry-level jobs will be created in these four sectors by 2009.

 With more than 3 million graduates getting added to the workforce every year, the marketplace is very crowded and fair assessment of candidates is difficult.

 ?In topnotch companies like Infosys, job advertisements generate no less than 10,000 to 15,000 applications. Selecting the right candidate after screening all the applications is indeed an uphill task and so pH scores can be used as an effective cut-off tool,? said Marwaha, explaining the benefits of the system, developed over 18 months by a team of experts. 

 ?Initially, we are expecting around 2,500 candidates taking the test every month, but we expect the number to grow to around 20,000 in a year?s time. By 2008, we hope to touch the one million mark,? signed off Marwaha.

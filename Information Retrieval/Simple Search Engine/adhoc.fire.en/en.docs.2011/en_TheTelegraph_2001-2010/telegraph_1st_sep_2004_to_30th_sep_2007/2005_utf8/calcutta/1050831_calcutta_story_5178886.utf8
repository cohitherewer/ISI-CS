Friday fresh: trinity time 

 Three directorial debuts bring three new perspectives to Bollywood on September 2. 

 Pratim D. Gupta spoke to the makers of Dansh, Ramji Londonwaley and 

 Aashiq Banaya Aapne about their first efforts and the competition

 Sonali Kulkarni and Kay Kay Menon in Dansh, and (below) Samita Bangargi and Madhavan in Ramji Londonwaley

 Kanika Verma (Dansh)

 Origin: When I was doing my M.Phil in political science, I realised that it was not turning out to be the right career option and I was really getting restless. I came to Mumbai and with the help of friend Manoj Bajpai got a job with director Hansal Mehta. I went on to assist him in all his projects including the films Dil Pe Mat Le Yaar, Chhal and Yeh Kya Ho Raha Hai, and his television work like the STAR Bestsellers. Two years back, I started working on my own project which turned out to be Dansh.

 First born: For me, the medium of cinema is not only for entertainment, it?s very important to communicate something. I was very disturbed with the intolerance levels of people in India, the amount of violence around. So I wanted to explore the psychological impact of violence, whether one is able to forgive or forget his or her enemy once things settle down. The price people have to pay for peace ? letting go of the trauma for social good. I want to provoke questions in the audience?s mind.

 Lights, camera, action: I set my film in Mizoram since that?s the only place which has made the successful transition to peace despite being the hub of violence for 20-30 years. The script was a very difficult one, talking about getting rid of personal vendetta. So I had to get very good actors who could portray the complex situations with simplicity. I consider Kay Kay, Sonali Kulkarni and Aditya Srivastava as some of the best actors in the industry and they have performed brilliantly.

 Opposition: My film has travelled festivals but Dansh also has a commercial life since it talks about a very simple human emotion. So, while anybody can follow it, there are more layers to unveil for the intelligent audience. As for the other three new releases, all seem interesting except Aashiq Banaya Aapne. While Pyaar Mein Twist and Ramji Londonwaley are both humourous in content, they may run into each other? but not my film. 

 Sanjay Dayma 

 (Ramji Londonwaley)

 Origin: I was doing my masters in economics when I figured out that I wanted to do something in the field of arts. I was a guitarist in a rock band. But I thought film was a better medium than music which successfully collaborated art and commerce. I went on to assist people in the industry before working as the co-scriptwriter and assistant director in Lagaan.

 First born: Contrary to popular belief, Ramji Londonwaley is not a remake of a south Indian film. Rather, it is an adaptation and is dynamically different from the original. When I was working on a film called Vivah, Maddy (Madhavan) came to me with the original script and after going through it, I felt that we needed to reinterpret it. The script was sent back to Kamal (Haasan) Sir with my two-page analysis and he agreed to the changes. 

 Lights, camera, action: There?s a fantastic soul in the film which will grow on the audiences. While it does have a particular recipe ? sugarless gajar ka halwa ? but more than the food, it is about the chef, rather the bawarchi. Talking about bawarchi, Ramji Londonwaley has nothing to do with Bawarchi but the kind of humour in the film goes back to the days of its director Hrishida (Hrishikesh Mukherjee).

 Emraan Hashmi, Sonu Sood and Tanushree Dutta 

 in Aashiq 

 Banaya Aapne

Opposition: Among the three other films releasing with mine, all have something unique about them. Pyaar Mein Twist, of course, brings back the Rishi-Dimple pair. Aashiq Banaya Aapne has a very exciting soundtrack and Dansh has two of my favourite actors, Kay Kay and Sonali. But my film with all the fun and human drama does break the clutter.

 Aaditya Datt (Aashiq Banaya Aapne)

 Origin: I was 16 when I assisted Vikram Bhatt on Kasoor and Raaz. Then I joined Mahesh Bhatt?s writing team and went on to become the chief assistant director of Tanuja Chandra for Yeh Zindagi Ka Safar, Sur and Filmstar. At 19, I wanted to direct my first film but since producers found it funny for a director to be so young I had to wait for two years before it could go on the floors.

 First born: I did ask Mahesh Bhatt to produce my film but he also found me too young. Then I felt it was no use directing for that banner since the directors have no real say and it?s finally Bhatt saab?s vision that is made. So I got a producer in Balabhai Patel who loved the way I narrated a simple college love triangle.

 Lights, camera, action: Mine is not a mature love story ? it?s how these three people become part of a triangle. The story is simple but what?s important is how it has been told ? the script, the dialogues... the music, of course, is a rage. Emraan Hashmi had to be there since I knew he could accept the role a lot faster than others. After watching Yuva, I knew Sonu Sood was perfect for the role of the introvert. As for Tanushree, she is very accessible, not the cold beauty standing far away on the ramp. 

 Opposition: With all due respect to the other three releases on the same Friday, I think Pyaar Mein Twist and Dansh are very much multiplex films while mine is a hardcore commercial film. I can?t talk about Ramji Londonwaley since I don?t know much about it. I just hope every film does well but Aashiq Banaya Aapne does the best.

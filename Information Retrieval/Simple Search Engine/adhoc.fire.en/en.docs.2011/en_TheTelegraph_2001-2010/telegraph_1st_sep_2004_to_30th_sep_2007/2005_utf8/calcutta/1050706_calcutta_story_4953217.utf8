 Cradle for crack scissorhands

 - Renowned stylist chooses city for setting up third academy in country for hair-care courses

 Placement prospects and big bucks make training in hair-styling a viable career option. A Telegraph picture 

 For a one-and-a-half-month course, pay Rs 20,000; for a three-month course Rs 26,000, and Rs 50,000 for a six-month course. The fee-list is not for a crack at animation or advertising, but the password to the city?s first hair academy.

 With the proverbial Italian saloon and the traditional hair-cutting hole in the wall giving way to swank snip stops and trendy stylist destinations, the demand for skilled scissorhands around town has gone to the head.

 Realising both the need for trained hairdressers and the willingness of young aspirants to give this new profession a try, Jawed Habib?s Hair amp; Beauty Academy is opening its third national stop in the city on Thursday.

 ?I get flooded with queries about hairstyling courses whenever I conduct a workshop in Calcutta,? says the master stylist based in Delhi. ?For many, travelling to Delhi or Hyderabad, where we have the other centres, is a problem because of finance or family.?

 The three hair-care courses would be taught in the academy, off Rashbehari Avenue, by Habib and other experts. ?In the 45-day course, scissors-holding exercises and basic cutting would be taught, while the two other modules would provide more scope for practice,? explains Reema Mondal, heading the Calcutta academy. Dummies and live models ? often passersby invited for a free haircut ? would be used during the longer course.

 Placement prospects at one of Habib?s 47 parlours across the country and in places like London, New York, Kathmandu and Dhaka, or at five-star hotels and top salons make it a viable proposition for those looking at alternative career options. Monthly salaries start around Rs 3,500 and go up to Rs 15,000.

 It also makes better business sense for hair-styling establishments to recruit trained hands. ?It?s a bonus getting someone who has already been trained by one of the big names in the industry,? admits Saira Ali, manager of the popular Taj Bengal salon.

 As for aspirants, the lure of a lucrative and creative career is worth the money spent. ?I am not well educated but I wanted a job that would offer a good working environment and be creative in some way,? says Sukhendu Chowdhury, who works in the City Centre parlour of Habib?s.

 Chowdhury hails from a poor family in Halishahar, North 24-Parganas. After being trained at the Delhi centre, he had stints in Delhi and Mumbai before returning to Calcutta. ?It was tough to manage the fees but I was able to repay my loan within a year of working,? he adds.

 Some of his neighbours in the village are now keen to pick up a pair of scissors, be trained closer home and make a career out of hair care.

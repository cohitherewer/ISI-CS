 Girl rescued in Mumbai

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A teenaged girl from Behala was rescued on Wednesday in Mumbai, where she was kept confined by traffickers.

 Though her stepmother, Ruksana Begum, who was involved in the racket, managed to escape, four others, including two women, were arrested. The girl has been handed over to her parents, Ilias Khan and Rubia Begum.

 Khan, who has two wives, has a 15-year-old daughter from his first wife Rubia. His second wife, Ruksana Begum, lives in Ekbalpore. 

 Ruksana reportedly asked Rubia if she would allow her daughter to accompany her to Ajmer Sharif. According to additional superintendent of police (industrial) H.K. Kusumakar, the mother was willing to let her daughter accompany her stepmother. Accordingly, the girl and stepmother Ruksana set off on August 25.

 Rubia had been in the dark about her daughter since then. On the first week of November, she lodged a complaint with Behala police station, and thereafter, police started an investigation.

 Police interrogated Ruksana?s relatives and her neighbours in Ekbalpore, and gathered that they were supposed to go to Mumbai. So, a police team left for Mumbai. 

 On Wednesday, the team from Behala police station, with the help of Mumbai police, reached Chembur, where they unearthed information on two women, Rehana and Roshan, who are Ruksana?s relatives.

 Police found the two in a flat on Meera Road, in Chembur, and they were detained. 

 During interrogation they gave away information on the 15-year-old girl. However, police could not trace Ruksana. The two girls told the police that instead of going to Ajmer Sharif, Ruksana had gone to Mumbai from Delhi.

 Rehana and Roshan told police that the girl was in the custody of Deepu and Mithun in another flat in the same area. Deepu is from Patharpratima in South 24-Parganas while Mithun is from Ekbalpore. Police rescued the girl and arrested Rehana, Roshan, Deepu and Mithun for their alleged involvement in trafficking.

 Petitions sought on roadblock pandals

lawyer cites puja sentiment

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 A public interest litigation (PIL) on puja pandals blocking roadspace came up for hearing on Friday before the division bench of acting Chief Justice Ashok Kumar Ganguly and Justice Tapan Kumar Dutta.

 The PIL was moved by Tapan Kumar Mitra, a resident of Dover Lane, in south Calcutta, seeking the court?s intervention to curb the menace of Durga puja and Kali puja pandals being constructed on thoroughfares, thereby restricting traffic movement.

 Admitting the PIL, the division bench asked the state government, police and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) to file affidavits to support their statements on the issue. 

 The court will also entertain petitions of other interested parties, including Puja organising committees.

 In October last year, a week before Durga puja, Mitra had moved court challenging the decisions of the CMC and Calcutta Police to allow construction of a pandal blocking a road near Dover Lane. 

 The petitioner had argued that the organisers had left only three feet of roadspace for pedestrian movement.

 A division bench of then acting Chief Justice A.N. Roy had appreciated the petitioner?s move and described it as a perfect PIL. 

 With just a few days to go for the Pujas, the court could not hear the petition. ?The matter should be heard in detail. The court should also hear the views of the organisers of the pujas and common citizens,? the court had observed. 

 The court had also advised the petitioner to file a fresh PIL, post-Pujas 2004. 

 The fresh petition by Mitra is a followup to his previous one.

 On Friday, CMC lawyer Alok Ghosh welcomed the move of the petitioner. ?The CMC has some guidelines with regard to the construction of puja pandals. I will tell the court about the CMC norms,? he said.

 ?Bengalis get into the festive spirit for just four to five days during Durga puja. The court will also have to understand the sentiments of the community,? Ghosh claimed.

 Every year, days before the Puja starts, more than 100 puja organisers in the city start erecting pandals blocking roads. Traffic movement is severely impeded in many places because of the obstruction. 

 On a few occasions in the past, firemen had to face immense difficulty in dousing a blaze because of the pandals blocking the way.

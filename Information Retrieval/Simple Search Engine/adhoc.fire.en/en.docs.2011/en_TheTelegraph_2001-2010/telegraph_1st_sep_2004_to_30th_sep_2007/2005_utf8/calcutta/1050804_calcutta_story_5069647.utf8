 Gym still mired in wrangles

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Super City Fitness Centre, in Kasba, set up by Australian NRI Deb Pahari in 2003, still lies tangled in a web of controversy, as the case between the Sydney-based body-builder and his relatives, Prasanta and Shelly Mukherjee, continues in the civil court. 

 Although the gym is still open and is being used by clients, the centre is besieged by a series of mishaps since the trouble began late last year. 

 Pahari claims the Mukherjees swindled him of over Rs 50 lakh. The Mukherjees deny the accusation, and allege that Pahari, Shelly?s cousin, had made them 55 per cent stakeholders in the project. 

 Pahari denies this, saying he had helped out the family by making Prasanta his operations manager.

 Pahari filed FIRs with Kasba police station twice earlier this year. The Mukherjees and the other accused were arrested, but got off on bail. Last week, the Mukherjees filed for an injunction order in the civil court, producing what they claimed was the partnership deed, but without Pahari?s signature on the document.

 The third civil court judge, senior division, in charge of the cases of the fifth civil court since it is vacant, Shantanu Jha, passed the order, allowing the Mukherjees access to certain areas of the gym. But on Monday, the Aussie boxing champ had the injunction stayed.

 On Saturday, the Mukherjees had visited the fitness centre in Pahari?s absence, along with a group of people, mostly former members of the centre?s staff. ?They ransacked the place, broke a few things, took advantage of the facilities, abused customers and even took an air-conditioner and a TV,? said Pahari.

 ?We did visit the place with our staff, who had been fired from the centre. But it?s our property, so why would we damage it?? countered Shelly.

 On Monday, in the court compound in Alipore, an altercation took place between the two groups, in which one of Pahari?s staff members was injured. They filed an FIR at Alipore police station, while the Mukherjees filed a general diary accusing Pahari of assaulting Prasanta.

 The Mukherjees obtained anticipatory bail in the case on Wednesday, said Manish Debnath, counsel for Pahari.

 ?The criminal investigation is ongoing, and we hope to complete it by this month. The Mukherjees have been accused under Section 420 of the IPC,? said S.N. Gupta, superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas.

 No help from the government is what Pahari rues the most.

 Winning ways: Khan Hasina Banu with Madhavan

 She lost her husband in September earlier this year and when she came to Deal Ya No Deal on Sony, she was looking for much more than an ordinary break. Khan Hasina Banu was looking to fund her 20-year-old son?s dream of being a pilot.

 So, when she appeared on the Madhavan-hosted game show, the 53-year-old mother of two from Churchgate in Mumbai was determined to strike a deal. And that Hasina did, winning Rs 50 lakh on the show, making her the biggest deal maker till date.

 The prize money will not only give wings to her son?s desire to fly high, but also help her buy ?a bigger flat in Mumbai?.

 Watch Khan Hasina Banu?s winning ways on Thursday, 8.30 pm, on Sony.

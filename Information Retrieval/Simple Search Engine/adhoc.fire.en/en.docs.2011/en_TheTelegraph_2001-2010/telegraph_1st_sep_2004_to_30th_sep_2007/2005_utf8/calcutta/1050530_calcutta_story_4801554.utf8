The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 No CAS, but channel glut

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 Better transmission quality and a wider array of channels to choose from. The basic demands of viewers may soon be fulfilled, thanks not to a government regulation prod but consumer demand and market forces at play.

 Digitisation is the new mantra for the cable and satellite trade. Multi-system operator (MSO) SitiCable, soon after acquiring the largest MSO in Calcutta, Indian Cable Net, announced that converting its existing network into a hybrid of digital and analogue modes would top its agenda for the coming months.

 This would allow the MSO to offer prime international channels to consumers who wish to opt for them, through set-top boxes. ?But this is no conditional access system, as any mention of set-top boxes is forcing some to think,? clarified an Indian Cable Net official on Sunday.

 ?We would free up around 60 MHz of space in our existing network to squeeze in 50 digital channels,? the official said. Indian Cable Net currently offers around 85 channels, five of which (in analogue mode) will be knocked off to make space for the additional 50 channels (in digitally compressed form).

 ?The viewer will receive both existing and new channels over the same wire, but will require a set-top box for accessing the latter,? the official explained. Last-mile operators will also benefit, since they will not have to upgrade.

 SitiCable?s existing inventory of digital set-top boxes will be used for the service, scheduled to start by August 15. Pricing will depend on market forces. ?For the boxes, it will be a rental plan for sure,? said the Indian Cable Net official. ?We will try to incorporate the box cost into the subscription plan and may even offer it free.? The channel choice will be sports, lifestyle, kids, music, movies and news.

 With the flurry of channels in the Indian skies ? 150 new ones in the next 12 months, according to recent report ? other city MSOs are also lining up their digital plans. Manthan, which has started the digitisation process, plans to start offering additional channels by September. ?Focusing on a mix of sports, education and regional content, we are looking at taking the number of channels from the existing 84 to around 150,? an official said.

 CableComm, the third MSO, feels it has an advantage since it already has a digital set-up. ?A section of our subscribers has even bought set-top boxes for better quality and the eight exclusive channels we offer to them,? a CableComm spokesperson said. 

 The company is in talks with some entertainment channels that currently have an Indian feed for their international beams. ?We can start offering around 50 channels pretty soon,? the spokesperson added.

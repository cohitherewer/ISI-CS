The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 VAT puts markets in shut mode

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A 24-hour trade bandh on Monday, called by the Federation of West Bengal Trade Associations against the imposition of value-added tax (VAT), is likely to affect markets not only across Calcutta but also in the adjoining districts of North and South 24-Parganas, as well as Howrah. 

 In the city, trading in parts of Burrabazar, Posta and Sealdah is likely to be affected by the bandh. Essential services have been exempted from the purview of the bandh. 

 According to association members, the bandh is to be a protest not just against the government?s decision to impose VAT from April 1, but also for putting the onus of payment of 10.2 per cent service tax on ?service receivers? for transporting goods by road.

 Mahesh Singhania, a spokesman of the association, said the VAT, which will replace the prevailing first-point sales tax system, is bound to increase the cost of essential commodities.

 Besides, he claimed, VAT would force traders to adhere to impractical rules and formalities, and subject them to conviction under criminal law.

 Other members of the association said the VAT would bring back the days of inspector raj, since a great deal of power would be vested on the inspectors and auditors. 

 Traders brought out a procession on Sunday in support of the bandh. They said some big markets in south, north and central Calcutta would be closed for the Monday bandh.

 Government officials said any attempt to forcibly close business establishments would be dealt with firmly. Policemen will be deployed to prevent any untoward incident, said a senior officer.

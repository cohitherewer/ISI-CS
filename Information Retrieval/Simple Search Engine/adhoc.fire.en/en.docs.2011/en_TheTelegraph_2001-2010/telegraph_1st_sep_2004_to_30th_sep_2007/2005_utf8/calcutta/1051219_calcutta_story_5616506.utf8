The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 A year has silently rolled on, leaving me and my family members totally devastated 

after the sad and untimely demise of my son Anindya, 19, a budding engineer, in 

a tragedy. The incident occurred on December 18, 2004, on the premises of No. 

5 Garia bus depot. It claimed two precious young lives due to rash and negligent 

driving as a bus was being steered out of the depot. The reasons behind the mishap 

spoke volumes about the poor infrastructure and lack of space. Since then, during 

my visits to the spot, I had found the place as unsafe for passengers as before. 

A section of drivers still have a propensity to flout rules inside the terminal. 

I patiently waited for a year expecting that the authorities would do something 

to improve the conditions at the depot, but it is unfortunate that the chaos still 

prevails. It seems the drivers will continue to remain careless come what may.

 Indian Railways spends relentlessly on advertisements banning smoking in public 

places on its premises and inside trains, but the effort doesn?t seem to work. 

Selling and smoking of cigarettes are rampant at most railway stations in the 

city and its suburbs. It would be of no use spending on anti-smoking campaigns 

until the surveillance is strict and law enforcement agencies penalise offenders. 

Usually, those who object to the smoking are ridiculed by the smokers. The railways 

should introduce non-smoking compartments if it can?t completely restrict smoking 

on trains.

 Six years after a Basu Chatterjee romantic drama, Saregama Films returns to Tollywood with an urban thriller in the horror genre. 

 Starring Locket Chatterjee, Sabyasachi Chakraborty, Rajatava Dutta, Soumitra Chatterjee and Swastika Mukherjee, Mantra is slated to hit the halls by the end of the month.

 ?We want to make good films with both new and established directors. For us, a good screenplay is what matters most. We saw a lot of passion in Rabi Ranjan Maitra and a strong script and so we decided to go ahead with Mantra,? said Sunil Bhandari, business head, Bengali Films, Saregama, on Wednesday. 

 The RPG Enterprises company plans to roll out ?at least four to five? films a year.

 Saregama had forayed into Bengali films way back in 1991 with Basu Chatterjee?s Hothat Brishti, starring Priyanka Trivedi and Firdaus. The Indo-Bangladesh joint venture, carrying the touch of Chatterjee?s signature directorial flair, did poorly in Bengal but went on to become one of the top-grossers in Bangladesh.

 Being pitched as a horror film for family viewing, Mantra also marks the directorial debut of Rabi Ranjan Maitra, whose work as an editor includes the films of Aparna Sen, Rituparno Ghosh and Buddhadeb Dasgupta.

 Though much on the lines of the Hollywood spooky film Child?s Play, Mantra has taken ?less than a crore? to make and revolves around a seven-year-old boy (played by Bihu Mukherjee) and his talking doll.

 ?But we haven?t shown any distortion of facts, blood and gore, or torture in the film. I have made a remix in the horror film genre. But the moment you transplant the story in Bengal, the entire environment undergoes a huge change,? explains Maitra, an FTII graduate who has also scripted and edited the film.

 ?Rituparno had conducted a five-day acting workshop with Locket, while Aparna Sen helped me streamline the script and Prosenjit pitched in with the casting,? added Maitra.

 The film has been shot with a handheld camera, recorded in sync sound and finished in a 21-day schedule.

 While Mantra awaits release, Saregama has got its second venture on the floors ? Haranath Chakraborty?s Ekar Sansar starring Prosenjit, Sayantani Ghosh and Swastika Mukherjee.

 ?We have spent two to three months working on the script. Haranath has a good understanding of the audience?s pulse,? said Bhandari.

 He added that Saregama was looking at a host of screenplays to determine its future course.

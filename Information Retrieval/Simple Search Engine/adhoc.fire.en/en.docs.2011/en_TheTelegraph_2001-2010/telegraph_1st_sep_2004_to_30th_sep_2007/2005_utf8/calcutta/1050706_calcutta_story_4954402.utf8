 Team Australia: Too good 

 One Indian in the top ten ODI batting list, none in the ODI bowling list. Two each in the Test batting and bowling lists. That?s how Team India players have fared in the latest Samsung Cricket Ratings.

 England?s Kevin Pietersen is the top ODI batsman, followed by Graeme Smith and Marvan Attapattu. Rahul Dravid is at number seven.

 South Africa?s Makhaya Ntini heads the ODI bowlers? list, with Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee in second and third places.

 Kevin Pietersen: Master blaster 

 In Test batting, South African Jacques Kallis firmly holds on to the top spot, followed by Adam Gilchrist at two and Virender Sehwag at three. The other Indian is Rahul Dravid, at nine. 

 The top Test bowling list sees Australian Glenn McGrath at number one, followed by Makhaya Ntini and Anil Kumble. Harbhajan Singh is relegated to the seventh position.

 Australia heads the list of top teams for both ODIs and Tests. India is right down at seven for ODI and at a very healthy three for Tests.

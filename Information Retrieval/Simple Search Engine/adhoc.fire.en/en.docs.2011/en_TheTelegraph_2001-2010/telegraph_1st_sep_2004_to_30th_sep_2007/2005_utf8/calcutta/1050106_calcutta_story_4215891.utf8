 Ustad Amjad Ali Khan performs at a Dover Lane conference

 A sanyasi from Gomukh makes an annual trip to the city every winter to attend this confluence of melodious strains, while a handful of Calcuttans has been attending the show religiously since its inception.

 Into its 53rd year, the soiree that was initiated by some music-lovers of the Dover Lane para, is assembling a long list of veteran and young musicians at Nazrul Mancha this season.

 Starting January 22, Dover Lane Music Conference 2005, presented by Desh, is dedicated to the memory of late Pandit AT Kanan, Ustad Vilayet Khan, Pandit VG Jog and MS Subbulakshmi. 

 The four-day-long soiree opens with an open-for-all bhajan recital by Pandit Jasraj, Haimanti Shukla and Upendra Bhatt. For the nightlong programmes 9 pm onwards, the line-up of vocalists includes Pandit Jasraj, Padma Talwalkar, Pandit Ajoy Chakraborty, Rashid Khan, Sruti Sadolikar, Aswani Bhide Deshpande, Tripti Mukherjee and Kaushiki Chakraborty. 

 Artistes on the instruments feature Ustad Amjad Ali Khan, Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia, Pandit Shiv Kumar Sharma, Bhabani Shankar, Sunil Auchat, Shahid Parvez, Shalil Shankar, Purbayan Chatterjee and Amaan Ali Bangash.

 ?We have incorporated both old and new musicians, because the young ones alone can?t pull in the crowds. So, we have clubbed three artistes ? Ustad Amjad Ali Khan, Pandit Jasraj and Pandit Chaurasia ? on the inaugural day for 10 hours of music,? said Dover Lane Music Conference governing body chairman Balai Majumder.

 ?US-based violinist L. Shankar, who was slated to perform, has cancelled his participation. We will soon announce his replacement,? added general secretary Nupur Mukherjee.

 Dover Lane Music Conference will confer the Sangeet Samman, in association with P.C. Chandra Group, on santoor exponent Pandit Shiv Kumar Sharma for his contribution to Indian classical music.

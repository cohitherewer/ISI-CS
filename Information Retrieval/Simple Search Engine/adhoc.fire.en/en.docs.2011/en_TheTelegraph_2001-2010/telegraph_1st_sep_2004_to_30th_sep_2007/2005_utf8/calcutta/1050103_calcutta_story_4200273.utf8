The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A musical journey

 Oxford Bookstore, in association with Ananda Publishers, launches Jibaner Jalsaghare, the autobiography of Manna Dey. A documentation of the gradual evolution of a great singer, the book traces the musical career of Dey in vivid detail. With a rich musical heritage as the nephew of the legendary K.C. Dey, his initiation into the world of music was by natural choice. With a rare flair to pick up a melody on hearing it once, he shot to fame as a singer even while he was in college. Later, as an indispensable playback singer in the Bombay film industry, he was associated with music directors of the stature of S.D. Burman, Salil Chowdhury and Shanker Jaikishen, who relied on him to sing their most difficult scores. His ability to improvise and to add the flavour of Hindustani classical music to any tune led to his immense popularity and success as a singer in the golden era of Hindi and Bengali films.

 Event: Launch of Jibaner Jalsaghare

 When: Today at 6.30 pm

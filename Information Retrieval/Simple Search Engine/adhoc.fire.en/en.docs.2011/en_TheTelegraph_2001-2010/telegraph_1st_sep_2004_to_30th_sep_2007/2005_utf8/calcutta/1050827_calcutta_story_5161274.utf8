 First, there was panic at Dum Dum Metro Railway station on Friday morning, when a bag was found abandoned at an entry point. But minutes later, panic gave way to surprise, when police discovered a pair of elephant tusks in the bag.

 The recovery was made during a routine check, started since the serial blasts rocked the London Underground last month. 

 ?The bag was lying abandoned at the station and there was no one to claim it. We have not yet arrested anyone,? said Damayanti Sen, deputy commissioner of police (north division).

 It was around 10.45 am, when officers of Sinthee thana, who were deployed at Dum Dum station to keep an eye on the premises and commuters, spotted the bag lying beside the door fitted with a metal-detector. 

 Initially, everybody, from policemen and Metro employees to commuters, became panicky. The cops asked commuters and employees not to come near the bag, fearing it could contain explosives.

 The officers, however, soon became sure that the bag had no explosives, after checking it with hand-held metal detectors. 

 ?It was then taken to the station master?s room and opened,? said an officer of Sinthee police station.

 The cops were stunned as soon as the bag was unzipped. ?We saw two off-white tusks inside. Initially, we doubted whether they were original. But the moment we touched them, we realised that both were genuine,? the officer added. 

 Elaborating on the possible reason for the carrier to leave behind the bag, Sen said: ?The person carrying it had wanted to catch a Metro train. He might not have anticipated such extensive checking at the entry. We suspect he had purchased a ticket and came close to the entry, but seeing he could no way sneak in without getting caught, abandoned the bag.?

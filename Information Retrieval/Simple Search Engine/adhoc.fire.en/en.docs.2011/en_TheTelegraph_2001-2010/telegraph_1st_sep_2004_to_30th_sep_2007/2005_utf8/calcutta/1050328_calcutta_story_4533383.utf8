The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

You can?t get through this week without?

 Flaunting Holi hues

Turn the Holi tints into something of a fashion statement by displaying them strategically. 

Scrub off all except for some on your cheekbones. Guys can try sporting a green 

beard if blushing red is not their thing. Deck up your coloured hands and feet 

with funky jewellery and watch the skin-conscious spoilsports take cover behind 

high collars and closed shoes!

Getting to work

Time to get rid of the Holi hangover, bhang hallucinations et al. Forget 

the Easter feast on Sunday, laden with chocolate eggs. It?s time to drag yourself 

out of bed and get back to work. If you thought the long weekend would make you 

miss the drudgery of office, the first few moments of Monday morning should prove 

otherwise.

Catching bro Nikhil

Catch a glimpse of Goa, oil spill notwithstanding, in My Brother... Nikhil. 

Follow the story of the dashing Sanjay Suri, a state swimming champion from the 

beach paradise. All?s well till he is arrested and his entire world collapses. 

What happens then? Find out for yourself. Reports have been more than encouraging.

Brushing up on F1

The doe-eyed Indian speedster Narain Karthikeyan has more than impressed with 

his first two races in Melbourne and Sepang. Now, after India?s first Formula 

One driver has proven his prow-ess, it?s time for his fans to buckle up and shift 

into overdrive. Before he hits the Bahrain track on Sunday, find out all you can 

about the fascinating sport so you know what you are cheering about.

Flying off

...Or at least planning to. With prices of air tickets nose-diving, it is time 

to plan that long-pending overseas holiday. Bon Voyage!

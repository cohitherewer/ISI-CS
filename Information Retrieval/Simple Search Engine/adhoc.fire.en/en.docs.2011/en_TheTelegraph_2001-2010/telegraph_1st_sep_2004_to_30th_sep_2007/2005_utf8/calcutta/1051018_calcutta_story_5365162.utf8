The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A brand new day

 From dust to dust: Rituparna Sengupta is 

on a roll 

If Rajpal Yadav was, deliberately, a few inches too 

short for Rituparna Sengupta, her next Tollywood film will try and make up the 

centimetres with the strapping Chandrachur Singh. The Maachis man is slated 

to sign a Bengali film to be directed by Raj Mukherjee, whose last release was 

Nagordola (Rupa Ganguly, Samata Das and Indrani Halder). 

 For Taposhya ? shooting begins in October-end ? Mukherjee is turning back to the Rajesh Khanna-Mumtaz-starrer Aaina.

 The Bengali film begins with Rituparna as a village girl shifting to the city to support her family. Almost predictably, she is drawn into a flesh-trade racket. Chandrachur is the man she loved during her village days, who returns to rescue her. 

 ?My role is of a single woman who faces a lot of troubles but triumphs at the end. It?s an emotional story and is good fodder for the masses. I have two item numbers in the film, too,? reveals Rituparna, currently elated with the success of Main Meri Patni Aur Woh. ?Rajpal had called to say that the film had grossed Rs 1.25 crore in the first week itself and five to six more prints are being released.?

 Her first foray in Bollywood ? Teesra Kaun in 1994 ? wasn?t successful. ?Maybe that wasn?t the right time and also because I was very young then,? reasons Rituparna.

 But after Main Meri?, a few offers from beyond Bengal have trickled in ? one starring south Indian hero Mammootty that Rituparna is keen on taking up. Her second Bollywood release Uns is due anytime in December, but right now she is concentrating on Anuranon. The Bengali film based on relationships by first-time director Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury, co-starring Rahul Bose, Raima Sen and Tota Roy Chowdhury, goes on the floors in December.

 Among the others, there?s Babli, aimed at the rural belt, where she plays a bustee girl opposite Oriya star Anubhav Mohanty.

 But now that Bollywood beckons and she?s done her fair share of Aparna, Rituparno and Buddhadeb, why does still sign up for the (often mindless) potboilers? 

 ?Because commercial cinema has given me everything ? my name, fame and identity. And besides, the kind of applause I get when I go up on stage for shows only reinforces how much I am still connected to my grassroots audiences. I believe I can still give them a lot,? she explains. ?But yes, now even in commercial cinema I want to do something that is believable and not just fantasy... I think I can do both kinds of roles right now. And I will never force myself to do something that I don?t suit? I wish Main Meri Patni Aur Woh opens a new chapter in my career.?

 Mother stumbles over defence volley

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Rajnis Patel: Five surgeries too fatal

 After facing a barrage of questions for the past three days, Munni Devi, mother of Rajnis Patel, nearly buckled under pressure on Friday.

 Two lawyers, representing junior doctors Sandip Manna and Jayanta Mondol, cross-examined her at the court of Alipore sub-divisional judicial magistrate Manjit Singh.

 In the face of rephrased questions that she had already answered, Munni Devi started to falter.

 ?Please listen carefully to the defence and think before answering the questions,? public prosecutor Naba Kumar Ghosh advised her. 

 ?If you do not understand something, please say so. The court will explain it to you. A lot depends on your statement, so please be clear,? he added.

 Both Nikhil Nandi and Chandi Bagchi, representing Sandip Manna and Jayanta Mondol, respectively, tried to prove that Munni Devi had no knowledge of the medical profession. They also tried to prove that someone else had motivated her statement.

 Nandi and Bagchi focussed on the fact that some doctors, other than the five accused, had been involved in Rajnis? treatment, but had not been named in the complaint.

 The questions came slowly on Friday, and were answered haltingly by Munni Devi. 

 ?When did you usually visit Rajnis??

 ?During visiting hours.?

 ?How did you come to know the names 

of the doctors??

 ?From my husband.?

 ?Can you specify the dates on which 

you went to speak to the doctors? When and where did you meet them??

 ?Outside the outdoor department, when they were on their rounds and in their chambers.?

 ?Did you enter the reduction room 

(next to an operating theatre)??

 ?No, I stood outside, but my husband had entered, like the relatives of the other patients there.?

 During the cross-examination, Munni Devi said: ?I can name the doctors who had tended to Rajnis until the fourth operation. I won?t be able to tell you the names of the doctors who conducted the fifth surgery, because I was anxious and puzzled at the time.?

 She added: ?I had seen a few other doctors entering the operating theatre while Rajnis was undergoing surgery, but I don?t know their names, and I had not tried to find out their identities.?

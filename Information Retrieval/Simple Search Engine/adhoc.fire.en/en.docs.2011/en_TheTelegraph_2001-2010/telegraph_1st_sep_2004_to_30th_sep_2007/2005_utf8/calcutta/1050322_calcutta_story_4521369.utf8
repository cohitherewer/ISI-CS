 Killed over carrom 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A game of carrom took a life on Sunday night. A youth died in the Charu Market area when a friend, with whom he was playing, attacked him with a knife.

 The injured, Sheikh Nasiruddin, was rushed to MR Bangur Hospital with severe wounds in his abdomen. He succumbed to his injuries. Sheikh Safi, his friend, was arrested. Later, neighbours of the victim assembled in front of the hospital and ransacked its emergency unit.

 Police said around 10 pm, Nasiruddin and Safi traded cheating charges during the game on the pavement of Deshapran Sashmal Road. Safi went off, only to return with a knife.

 Recently, the West Bengal Cooperative Milk Producers? Federation has launched lassi in poly packs under the brand Ben?s, on sale at Mother Dairy outlets in the city. The packet of 200 ml has been priced at Rs 6. I purchased the product quite a few times. Then, to verify a hunch, I checked its volume and found it contains only 180 ml. This may be the case with units of the product elsewhere as well. The print on the pack should match the actual volume of the product. In case there is any possibility of the volume reducing during transit, the print on the packet should mention it. I also have a suggestion. A specified spot has not been marked on the packet that will be easy to pierce and insert the straw. Will the authority concerned look into the matter?

 This is the first time that I am hearing of such a complaint. If the consumer approaches us directly with the date and place of purchase, we will surely investigate into the matter. Discussions with designers who package our products can also be held to make the packet more user-friendly. We have introduced Ben?s Lassi on a trial basis and presently supply 1,000 units to select Mother Dairy outlets across the city. The product?s official launch is on May 18 at Writers? Buildings. Then, we will gradually increase supply to 10,000 units a day. Over the coming months, we are planning to launch several other milk products, like sweets and paneer. So, suggestions from customers will help us improve the products during the trial period itself. Customers can reach us at 23352844/2860.

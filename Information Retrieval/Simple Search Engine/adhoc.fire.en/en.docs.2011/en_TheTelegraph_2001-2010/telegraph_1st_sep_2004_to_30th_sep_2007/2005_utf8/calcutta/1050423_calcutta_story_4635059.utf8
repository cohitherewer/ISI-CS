 The Indianised skirt or ghagroo can be worn in various styles on a number of occasions, says Ipsita Deb

 The skirt has been occupying a major slice of fashion space for a while now. The Indian innovation within this medium has been the ghagroo (an almost westernised ghagra) in innumerable styles and cuts. And with long skirts back in fashion, this ankle-length style keeps tradition intact with a touch of fun.

 Ogaan at Southern Avenue has stocked up on a number of ghagroos by designer Karuna Khaitan of the designer label Wild Orchid. 

 In a variety of colours, these are ideal for some night-time revelry, a conventional wedding bash or even an informal gathering at a friend?s place. It?s the way you style it and carry it off.

 For Goodlife, model Sheena sports some of the many looks possible with a single stylish ghagroo.

 Ethnic edge

 When you?ve got a fancy ghagroo with a lot of sparkles in the form of glitter or sequins, it?s best to keep the shine to a minimum while matching it with a suitable top. Kurtis have taken the fashion scene by storm, with even Hollywood actresses like Cameron Diaz flaunting them every now and then.

 Here, Sheena combines the kurti flavour with the ghagroo style to bring alive a casual yet stylish look. Great for a semi-formal gathering or an unconventional dinner where you?re looking to add some spunk, this orange and gold printed kurti by Delhi-based designer Kavita Bhartia deflects the extra shine from the silver sequins stitched on the ghagroo. And by pairing it with a simple yet long top ? be it a kurti or kurta ? in your colour of choice, you can even don the college-girl jhola look, if that catches your fancy.

 Wedding wow

 Just like the ghagra, the ghagroo is often the best bet for a wedding do. The importance here lies in the blouse, and of course the dupatta. The dupatta should most definitely be colour-coordinated with the ghagroo but the blouse can be as innovative as you want it to be. Be it strappy. off-shoulder, low cut or with Chinese collars, the choice is yours.

 Sheena is wearing a simple cut blouse, off-white in colour, with tiny sequins as embellishments. While the glitter adds to the glam factor, the simplicity of the blouse makes it a great sangeet or mehndi outfit. The dupatta is a transparent black and white striped netted light wool fabric that has been draped in such a way as create the effect of a sari.

 Party pretty

 In the last look, it?s party time. Sheena uses a simple yet flattering white spaghetti strap top made of raw silk with crossover straps, in combination with the ghagroo. This results in an Indo-western appeal.

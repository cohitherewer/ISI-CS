 Holly Hunter: Cool cut

 After all that hype surrounding her West End debut, Hollywood actress Holly Hunter?s Irish accent in the play By the Bog of Cats has come under criticism. While a BBC radio presenter has even called it ?one of the worst Irish accents ever to grace the West End?, Hunter has taken all this in her stride. Brushing aside the criticism, she said: ?I?m only interested in what me, my director and the cast can create on the stage? I never read reviews.?

 Accent apart, Hunter has been showered with praise for her riveting performance as Hester Swane. The play by Marina Carr is set in the stark landscape of the bogs of rural Ireland, where Hester is an Irish traveller tormented by a painful past and the agony of having been betrayed by the man she loves. Teetering on the brink of despair, Hester pulls herself together to plot revenge on her lover, and even punish him by killing her own child.

 By the Bog of Cats was last performed at the San Jose Repertory Theatre in 2001, when Hunter first played the role of Hester. 

 The Academy Award-winning actress forayed into Broadway with Beth Henley?s Crimes of the Heart in 1982. Her second project, also with Henley, was The Wake of Jamey Foster. 

 Forty-six-year-old Hunter received an Oscar in 1993 for her role of a mute Scottish widow in Jane Campion?s The Piano. On the big screen, she was last seen in Catherine Hardwicke?s Thirteen, which fetched her an Oscar nomination.

 Tapan Theatre, known to many as Nahabat (the play that ran there for 1,000 nights before a financial crisis forced a shutdown), is poised for a rewind into its heydays. On its renovated premises ? the auditorium has been given a fresh lease of life with a new ceiling, seats, air-conditioning and upgraded acoustics ? a star-studded cast led by Supriya Chowdhury and Madhabi Mukherjee will revive the now dead genre of mainstream theatre with Janani on January 23. 

 Conceived by Samar Mitra of Niva Arts, the organisation that has steered the hall?s makeover move, the production pits Supriya Chowdhury as the mother-in-law against Madhabi Mukherjee, in the form of her elder daughter-in-law. ?The story centres around a joint family and the problem that arises when the structure breaks down. There are three brothers, their mother and the wives,? says Mitra. 

 The cast borrows heavily from the small screen, featuring the likes of Anuradha Roy, Sanghamitra Banerjee and Bodhisatwa Majumdar. Theatre thespian Gyanesh Mukherjee features in a special role. 

 As the family and its actions form the core of the two-and-a-half-hour-long drama, Janani will be jazzed up with colourful displays of Dol and Durgotsav. ?We will hold shows every Thursday, Saturday and Sunday, the schedule that used to be followed by mainstream theatre before,? added Mitra.

 After a 10-year shutdown, the auditorium was opened with a month-long theatre festival on January 2 with 32 troupes from Calcutta and Howrah. 

 ?We had invited theatre groups to stage shows and check out if the auditorium was up to the mark,? explained Mitra.

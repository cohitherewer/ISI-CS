The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 We Ask You Answer

 A year too little for real work

 Each week, Metro asks its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses is published every Wednesday. Today?s question: Should civic polls be held every year?

 Rounak Pal,

 Birati

 We are quite used to political leaders waking up from their slumber a couple of months before election to refurbish their tainted image. The leaders retreat to their air-conditioned chambers for hibernation as soon as the polls are over. The end result: citizens are denied even the most basic amenities. If civic elections are held every year, the common people will not have to wait five years for some work to be done. 

 Saadia Sitwat, 

 Linton Street

 Civic elections should not be held every year as polls are merely an excuse for political parties to waste money that could be spent for constructive purposes. Polls also mean traffic snarls due to campaign rallies and blaring loudspeakers at election meetings.

 Ahasan Jahir Mollah, 

 Mahestala

 Never. The chairman of a municipality is nothing but a puppet in the hands of political parties. Polls every year will only add to the expenditure. A person who cannot improve civic facilities in five years will not be able to do so in a year. 

Suvadip Goswami, 

 Mahestala

 Expenditure is a major consideration in holding civic elections. No civic body can do good work in just one year. At least three to four years are needed to see through projects. Holding civic polls every year would be wasteful.

 Kajal Chatterjee, 

 Sodepur

 A poor country like India cannot afford the luxury of spending a mammoth sum for holding civic elections every year. The bitter reality is that there is hardly any difference between political parties, which are all morally bankrupt. It would be too optimistic to expect that quick change of civic regime will benefit the people.

Debasish Chakraborty,

 Nilmoni Mitra Row 

 Defaced walls and false promises are all that the public get by way of polls. If civic elections are held every year, it will result in harassment of the people, with no beneficial consequences.

 Ujjal Bhattacharyya, 

 CIT Road

 Annual elections will not provide civic boards enough time to establish themselves. Various civic services will be affected as a result. Optimum utilisation of resources is possible only on a long-term basis. Annual elections will not let that happen. The huge cost of holding elections is yet another deterrent. 

 Diptimoy Ghosh,

 Salt Lake

 If civic polls are held every year, it will lose its importance. Some people might believe that annual polls would ensure that there is no interruption in development work, but that is unlikely to happen. The politicians would be too busy campaigning for elections to work in their ward. They would also not take up lengthy projects given the uncertainty over their re-election. Holding elections every three years would be a better idea.

 D.P. Bhattacharya,

 Sonarpur

 Civic polls should not be held every year since it involves huge expenditure that will have to be borne by the citizens. Besides, the elected board will get little opportunity to prove itself within such a short duration.

 Sandhya Banerjee,

 Salt Lake

 The civic polls should be held every year even if it means shooting up of electoral expenditure. It is in the public interest to remove candidates who are not doing their duty.

 A.K. Mitra,

 Pudda Pukur Road 

 It is a great idea but dearth of funds will not allow its implementation. Civic elections should at least be held every alternate year so that only the fittest candidates remain in power over a long period. Polls every alternate year will also help to ease the financial troubles of unemployed youths and provide some news items to the media.

Santosh Chakravarty, 

 Unique Park

 The rationale behind the proposal escapes me. The idea is wasteful in every way. More frequent elections would strain the public exchequer. A newly constituted civic body would also not get time to settle down.

 A.F. Kamruddin Ahmed,

 Collin Lane

 The proposal of holding civic elections every year is not a good one because one year is not enough for municipal boards to carry out developmental work. After every election, about a month is lost in assigning portfolios to the elected representatives. Add to that over a month-and-half of holidays and you have a recipe for disaster. The proposal is impractical.

 Rajdeep Guha,

 Panchanantala Road

 The election process is cumbersome and costs a great deal of money. Hence, holding civic polls every year is not at all feasible. It will put an unnecessary burden on the state exchequer. Moreover, the winning party won?t get time to implement policy decisions. The gap of five years between consecutive civic polls is ideal for our country. 

Sunil Banerjee,

 VIP Road

 Holding civic polls every year will create several problems. Poll graffiti would make the city uglier and civic services would be hampered as the councillors would be too busy procuring nominations for the next election to work in their wards.

 Tapan Pal,

 Budge Budge

 Why? The taxpayers? money should be utilised for more important causes. Stability is essential for any civic board to perform. In fact, their tenure should be extended to seven years.

Prahlad Agarwala,

 Majdia, Nadia

 Given that civic polls cost a lot of money apart from causing tension in neighbourhoods, it should not be held every year. Yearly polls would impede development.

P. Pramanik,

 Santoshpur Avenue

 Annual civic polls would be costly for both citizens and candidates, and will result in laundering of black money. Also, a year is not enough to evaluate a candidate?s performance.

 Subhankar Banerjee,

 Borehat

 It would be ridiculous to hold civic polls every year given the financial condition of the state. Civic projects are generally time-consuming and are seldom completed in a year. How will the electorate determine the efficacy of a civic authority?

Debyani Basu,

 Saptagram

 If the civic polls are held every year, the councillors would try to win over people by doing maintenance work like repair of street lamps, but won?t take up time-consuming projects, which will prove detrimental in the long run. The five-year tenure is fine.

 Debashis Saha,

 Anath Deb Lane

 No. This will not help the councillors improve their performance. Rather a tenure of two or three years may be given a try.

 Avishek Ganguly,

 Howrah

 Civic polls should be held every year. That will encourage political parties to carry out development work. Moreover the public will also be able to assess the performance and switch loyalties immediately if it is not up to the mark.

Chandan Roy,

 Sakuntala Park

 A civic body should remain in power for at least three years. Neither five years nor one year is a solution.

K.B. Goswami,

 Central Park

 Important civic projects require planning and procurement of funds, which takes a lot of time. One year is too short a period of time for a civic board to complete such projects. Each board should be granted at least a three-year tenure.

Samyak Nandy, 

 Bangur Avenue

 The time span of a year between two successive elections is too short for the elected candidate to prove his/her mettle,especially in a country like India where a simple job takes eternity to be completed. So to be fair the time between two successive elections should be three years.

Kaustav Sinha,

 Garia 

 No.Conducting polls is a hectic process and involves a huge amount of money. People will witness more campaigning than fulfilment of their day-to-day needs.

 Matching up to the Dhoom magic

 SUDESHNA BANERJEE

 Back home for Kali puja after a two-year gap. That too with the double incentive of getting bhaiphota from an elder sister who seldom comes home. Music director Pritam has been on cloud nine ever since his return to hometown on Wednesday. 

 The former student of Presidency College, who created such a Dhoom with his score in the mega hit movie, needed this break from a gruelling schedule that has now become a way of life. On Diwali, word was out in Mumbai that I was already in Calcutta so I could stay away from the taash parties. I usually end up losing badly if I play, he laughs.

 A loss of reputation that still rankles is the debate over the Chocolate score in which two songs he did not compose were attributed to him in the album. One of them, Zehreeli Raatein, it later turned out, resembled the track Aadat by the Pakistan band Jal. I did not even get paid for those songs. Khaya peeya kuch nahin, gilas tora barah anna, he shrugs.

 The incident has made Pritam so wary that he is taking his own initiative to buy the rights of an old French song for a forthcoming film after the producer refused to take the trouble.

 Another ironic hurdle in his way is the success of Dhoom. A mega hit can leave mega expectations in its trail. The music of Ek Khiladi Ek Haseena is a hit by industry standards. But I cannot find satisfaction in a lesser hit than Dhoom macha le any more, Pritam smiles ruefully.

 The same thought plays on his mind now that he is on to Dhoom 2. All the actors in the sequel ? Abhishek, Hrithik and Aishwarya ? are hit stars now, in contrast to the earlier film that had nothing to show except the Yashraj Films name. So expectations will be sky-high. Two songs have been recorded and he goes back to work on the third even as shooting starts next week.

 Pritam is looking forward to breaking the item song specialist tag with the score for his upcoming films ? Anurag Basus Gangster (from the Mahesh Bhatt stable) and Ankahi, a Mukesh Bhatt production. One will be very rock, with psychological shades, while the other is pop, treatment-wise. 

 But what the 34-year-old hankers for is an opportunity to work in serious (Maachis or Roja) or period films (Umrao Jaan or Parineeta).

 Pritam has known Shantanu Moitra, the Piya bole man, ever since the two Bengalis were strugglers in Mumbai. Once we had gone to London for the mastering of our respective compositions ? he for Mann ke Manjire and I for Tere Liye, one of my first Hindi films. The two of us went out to a Greek restaurant and ordered an exotic-sounding dish. What arrived was panta bhaat with a slice of lemon. We didnt know whether to laugh or cry at the ?20 bill.

 With releases lined up in a row after Garam Masala hit the multiplexes this week, Pritam sure is laughing now.

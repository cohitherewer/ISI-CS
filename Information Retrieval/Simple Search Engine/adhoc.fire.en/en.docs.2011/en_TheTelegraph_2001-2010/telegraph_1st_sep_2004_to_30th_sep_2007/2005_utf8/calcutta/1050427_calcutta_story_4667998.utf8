 We Ask You Answer

 New year toast to lost tradition

 Each week, Metro asks its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses is published every Wednesday. Today?s question: Has Poila Baisakh lost out to New Year?s Day among Bengalis?

 Jyoti Baksi,

 Heysham Row

 Since the Gregorian calendar is generally followed in our daily life, January 1 has become more popular than Poila Baisakh. While New Year greeting cards can be found in almost all shops, Nava Varsha greeting cards are difficult to get, except in a few big stores. The customs of wearing new clothes, eating sweets and going to temples on Poila Baisakh, however, still persist. Restaurants have recently started revamping their menus to celebrate the Bengali new year.

 Due to the influence of the West on the Bengalis, Poila Baisakh has lost its charm over the years. The community has become more interested in celebrating the New Year. And it should not blamed for that as the Gregorian calender is followed all over the world.

 Sandhya Banerjee, 

 Salt Lake

 Poila Baisakh has not lost out to New Year?s Day among Bengalis. A lot of effort goes into making the first day of the Bengali calender special. People wear new clothes, greet each other and visit relatives with sweets, while children seek the blessings of elders. Several cultural programmes are organised during the day. Shopowners also try to make the day special for their customers.

 Surajit Gupta, 

 Fakir Chand Mitra Street

 Certainly not. Poila Baisakh is observed elaborately by Bengali businessmen, especially cloth and jewellery merchants. Though Bengalis spend a lot during New Year, it will never take the Poila Baisakh?s place in their hearts. 

 Anuradha Raza, 

 Darga Road

 Bengalis just need a reason to celebrate, and how can they forget their very own Poila Baisakh. Crowded markets and over-booked restaurants are a common feature on Poila Baisakh. This underlines the fact that Bengalis celebrate as much on the day as on New Year?s eve.

 Amartya Bera,

 Belur 

 Bengalis are known for their rich cultural heritage and Poila Baisakh is among the most important days for them. The day has not lost out totally, even though it has been overshadowed by New Year?s Day to a certain extent. Children wear new clothes and businessmen distribute sweets among customers on Poila Baisakh even now.

 Naren Sen, 

 Howrah

 Poila Baisakh is not just a memorable day for Bengalis but for all residents of West Bengal. Bengali men wear dhuti-panjabi on the day even if they steer clear of traditional wear for the rest of the year. Traders decorate their shops and offer prayers at temples on the day.

 On the contrary, the New Year?s Day is losing out to Poila Baisakh. There was a time when January 1 was earmarked for fun and enjoyment. Greetings cards were exchanged and people went for outings. Poila Baisakh, in contrast, was celebrated only by businessmen. Now, even greeting cards for the Bengali new year are readily available, and more and more people go out on Poila Baisakh. Cultural functions are also held everywhere. New Year?s Day, in comparison, has lost its sheen.

 Dalim Kumar Datta,

 APC Road

 Earlier, Poila Baisakh was observed only by businessmen, but now the day occupies a special place in the calender of most Bengalis. Members of the community wear new clothes and the religious-minded visit temples on the day.

 Santosh Chakravarty,

 Unique Park

 Ninety per cent of the urban Bengali youth do not know their date of birth according to the Bengali calender. They are even educated in English. It is natural that they would celebrate New Year?s Day with more vigour than Poila Baisakh. While Bengali new year day is not celebrated ostentatiously, January 1 is. The weather also plays its part. An outing in April is not a good idea, while January is the best month for going out.

 Debasish Chakraborty,

 Nilmoni Mitra Row 

 Poila Baisakh is a day of festivity and prayers. On the day, businessmen invite their customers and arrange refreshments for them. No such custom is associated with the New Year?s Day. Hence, it is not fair to say that Poila Baisakh is losing out to January 1.

 Sunanda Sanyal, 

 Babubagan

 No, the charm surrounding Poila Baisakh is not evident on New Year?s Day. Traditional families still celebrate the Bengali new year with pomp and grandeur. New dresses are purchased and delicious food items prepared to mark the day. Shopowners gift their customers sweets and calenders. New Year celebration, on the contrary, is limited to a smaller section of people, primarily youngsters.

 Sandipan Mitra,

 Sunny Park

 For Bengalis, Poila Baisakh has retained its importance. New Year?s Day is celebrated primarily by young people, whereas people of all ages take part in the Poila Baisakh festivities.

 Sachindra Nath Mitra,

 Beleghata

 Quite obviously, Poila Baisakh has lost out to New Year?s Day. The primary reason for that is financial transactions are made following the Gregorian calendar.

Bapi Saha,

 Paikpara

 It is partly true that Poila Baisakh has lost out to New Year?s Day. These days, only the businessmen celebrate the Bengali new year day. This is a result to globalisation and the influence of the West.

Nairit Chowdhury,

 CIT Road

 Poila Baisakh has lost out to New Year?s Day among Bengalis as a result of globalisation. Except to mark dates like Poila Baisakh or Baisakh 25, we hardly use the Bengali calender.

 D.P. Bhattacharyya,

 Sonarpur

 Bengalis are fond of festivals, hence they observe January 1 with great enthusiasm. But the tradition of observing Poila Baisakh has not suffered as a result, especially in the rural areas.

 Debashis Saha,

 Anath Nath Deb Lane

 Poila Baisakh is no longer as special as it used to be. And New Year?s Day is not solely responsible for that. There are a number of festivals throughout the year. They have all contributed to the diminishing of interest in the Bengali new year day.

 D

 iptimoy Ghosh,

 Salt Lake

 Poila Baisakh is celebrated in a grand way even by Bengalis who take part in the New Year festivities. The sales in shops are ample proof of the fact. In the rural areas, January 1 is hardly observed, whereas Poila Baisakh is eagerly awaited. The better weather during New year has contributed to its popularity.

 Debyani Basu,

 Birati

 Very few of us have Bengali calendars in our homes, hence it is quite logical that New Year is more widely celebrated than Poila Baisakh. The day has lost its relevance among Bengalis, most of whom are bent on forgetting their cultural legacy. 

 Sayan Dutta,

 Howrah

 It is awful that Bengalis are slowly but surely losing their identity. In a bid to be modern the community has distanced itself from its culture and traditions. Bengalis have been so influenced by the West that they have adopted the lifestyle there. Poila Baisakh is one of the many Bengali occasions that have suffered due to this cultural decline. People forget to wish each other on the Bengali new year day, but stay up late to usher in the New Year.

 Sandip Banerjee,

 Address not given

 Earlier, people used to buy clothes for both Poila Baisakh and Puja, but nobody buys clothes for the Bengali new year more. Not surprising, when an elite city club actually bars entry to people wearing Bengali traditional dresses. Poila Baisakh melas in various parts of the city have all but disappeared.

 Pijush Kanti Ssarkar,

 Narendrapur

 Bengalis are most fond of imitating the West. So January 1 is more significant to them than Poila Baisakh. There was a time sweet shops used to invent new items for the day. But those days have passed.

 Tech updates should target greater good

 - ENDOSCOPY 

PANEL TO FRAME CODES FOR DISINFECTION, PROCEDURE ELIGIBILITY

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Striking the right balance between use of high-end technology and rationalisation of available resources is the key to effective diagnosis and management of gastrointestinal disorders, according to international faculty attending the sixth annual conference of the Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy of India being held in the city.

 Endocon 2005, the three-day symposium on emerging global techniques in the field of GI endoscopy, kicked off on Sunday with a clutch of procedures being performed at the Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals and beamed live to Hyatt Regency, the venue for presentations and panel discussions. Even as they demonstrated the latest advancements in their respective areas of specialisation, GI endoscopy experts from leading institutes around the world underlined the need to be cost-effective and reach out to the masses.

 ?We must not get carried away by the flamboyance of technology and lose sight of the fundamentals and best practices in simple things that can go a long way,? Paul Fockens, director of endoscopy, department of gastroenterology amp; hepatology, University of Amsterdam, told Metro.

 ?Itll be a tragedy if the advancements we describe at this seminar can?t be used here. We must keep on developing new techniques, but it?s equally important to address the sufferings of people who have been shut out till now,? said Pankaj Jay Pasricha, chief, division of gastroenterology and hepatology, The University of Texas Medical Branch.

 Most of the experts agreed endoscopic disinfection and accessories re-usability was a burning issue in a developing country like India. ?Back in the US, we have extremely stringent guidelines for scope and accessories sterilisation. However, it costs a lot of money to be totally safe and if we are to apply the highest principles of disinfection here, only a minuscule section of the population can be screened. Hence, it?s imperative to weigh the risks of cross-infection against the numbers one can reach out to with basic sterilisation methods,? observed Gregory Haber, director of gastroenterology, Lenox Hill Hospital, New York.

 Organising secretary and head, institute of gastroenterology, Apollo Gleneagles, Mahesh K. Goenka, said the national forum is working on a set of standardised norms for disinfection, to be released later this year. ?We are also framing guidelines on who is eligible to perform an endoscopic procedure on a patient, since experts are trained to minimise risks and ensure a lesser degree of patient discomfort in this fast-evolving field,? he added.

 Like Goenka, another city-based GI specialist Sarika Kedia emphasised the need for public awareness. ?Patients have the right to demand a clean scope and all endoscopy centres should have a transparent system vis-?-vis disinfection. Anyone going in for a procedure is entitled to know about the degree of cross-infection risk involved,? she stressed.

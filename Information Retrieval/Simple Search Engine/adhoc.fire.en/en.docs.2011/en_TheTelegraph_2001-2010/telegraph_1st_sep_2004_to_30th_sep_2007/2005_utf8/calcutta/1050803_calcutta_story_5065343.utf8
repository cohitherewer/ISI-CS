The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bike theft bust team

 PRASUN BHATTACHARYA

 A team of Howrah police has unearthed an international two-wheeler racket during a raid to arrest some of its members in a North 24-Parganas village that shares its border with Bangladesh. Stolen motorcycles were also seized during the raid.

 The spread of the racket in Howrah can be gauged from the fact that the cops have put together a special team to exclusively deal with motorcycle thefts. Calcutta is not off the racket radar, either.

 ?It is a serious problem. We have taken a number of steps to curb the menace,? said Kalyan Banerjee, additional superintendent of police, Howrah.

 The special team, led by additional superintendent of police (north) D.P. Singh, has nine officers, including those from Howrah, Shibpur and Bally police stations.

 ?The team has recovered 16 stolen motorcycles. About 71 two-wheelers have been stolen this year,? Banerjee added. In 2004, 125 motorcycles were stolen. Only 14 were recovered.

 The racket is most active in Howrah, Nadia, Hooghly and North and South 24-Parganas. In the city, it is active on the southern fringes, including areas like Tiljala and Topsia, said a member of the team.

 According to the cops, special checkpoints for motorcycles have been set up at the three gateways to Howrah ? Bally, Howrah bridge and Vidyasagar Setu.

 ?The papers of motorcycles leaving Howrah are being checked. However, it is difficult to stop the thieves. They manage to whisk away the vehicles to the border areas and sell them off. As the border is not well-defined, it is difficult for the Border Security Force (BSF) to prevent the vehicles from being taken to Bangladesh,? stated Banerjee. 

 ?I will check with the officials concerned what can be done,? said Manish Ranjan, deputy commandant, BSF.

 A senior police officer said the stolen motorcycles enter Bangladesh mainly through Basirhat and Bongaon sub-divisions of North 24-Parganas. 

 ?There is a booming market for Indian bikes in Bangladesh. A standard 100cc motorcycle costs about Rs 65,000 in Bangladesh. In comparison, a stolen 100cc bike from India costs around Rs 30,000. The demand is high and, it seems, so is the supply,? he explained.

 On an average, 150 to 200 motorcycles are stolen from Calcutta and Howrah, and illegally pushed into Bangladesh every month, the officer stated. 

 He added that the thieves generally work in groups of two. They carry out a spot assessment by day and steal the motorcycles when their owners leave them unlocked.

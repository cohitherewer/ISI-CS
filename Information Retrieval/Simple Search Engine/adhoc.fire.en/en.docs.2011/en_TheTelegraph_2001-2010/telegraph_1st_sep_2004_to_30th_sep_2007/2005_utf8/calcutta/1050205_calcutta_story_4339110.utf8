 Hostage kin not alone in prayer

 - Township united in distress, cops cite handicap

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Roma?s father is not alone. On Friday, as Satya Narayan Jhawar sat down for evening prayers at CB 68, several others joined him from adjoining Salt Lake homes. The crisis ? of a child leaving home in the morning and being abducted practically at the doorstep ? was, clearly, a collective one.

 ?It?s unnerving and leaves all of us with a deep sense of insecurity. I have a 16-year-old girl and she, too, moves around in a car. It?s so hard to believe that a college girl, too, can become the target of abductors,? said Santosh Murarka, next-door neighbour of the Jhawars.

 A businessman engaged in the dyeing trade ? same as the Jhawars ? Murarka added: ?She (Roma) never led a flashy lifestyle. Every morning, she would leave home for college in the car along with her friend? It is hard to believe that this could have happened to her. Even my daughter, who is appearing for the Board exams this year, goes to school or the swimming pool, every day. What happens if??

 Residents of the CA, CB and DB blocks said they had set up night patrol committees to intensify vigil in the area, but added that such an abduction added a diabolical dimension to Salt Lake crime.

 Despite a clamour for extra police cover from various pockets of Salt Lake, the district cop brass refused to read too much into the incident. ?The kidnappers do not appear to be experienced hands. Why would they call up using the girl?s mobile phone? The only cause of concern here is the girl?s age,? said Harman Preet Singh, deputy inspector-general (Presidency range).

 Police said they were strapped for funds and lacking infrastructure support. They admitted that even if cops had been anywhere close to the abduction spot, it would have taken quite a while before an effective intervention was made.

 ?More than half of the hand-held wireless sets are defunct. And to make matters worse, the force in the township is so inadequate that it cannot even meet the demands of daily policing,? said an inspector of police.

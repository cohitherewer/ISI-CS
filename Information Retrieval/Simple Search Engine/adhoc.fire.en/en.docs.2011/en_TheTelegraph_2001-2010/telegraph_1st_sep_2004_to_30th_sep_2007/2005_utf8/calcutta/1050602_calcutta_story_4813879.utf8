Life

 Moonstruck minstrel

 All set to launch a private 

 album after four years, singer SONU NIGAM talks to Pratim 

 D. Gupta about the forthcoming venture

 Its being touted as the 

 album of the year. And not without reason. Chanda Ki 

 Doli features the return of Sonu Nigam into pop albums 

 after four long years.

 The man, whose previous independent 

 efforts like Deewana, Mausam and Jaan have 

 always set the music store cash registers rocking, has strung 

 together nine romantic numbers in his new compilation.

 The launch of Chanda Ki Doli 

 under the T-Series label has been planned to coincide with 

 a documentary on Sony Entertainment Television titled Sensational 

 Sonu Nigam ? The Making of a Star and also a special 

 concert by the star. 

 Before the album hits the racks 

 and the video finds its way on to the airwaves, Sonu took 

 time out to speak to Goodlife about his most recent 

 musical venture.

 Back beat

 Its been quite some time 

 Sonu has expressed himself musically. Chanda Ki Doli, 

 feels the singer, will do the needful. 

 All the songs are romantic 

 numbers written by me over a period of one-and-a-half years. 

 And since its my first private album release after 

 four years, its quite special. The music label T-Series 

 liked all the songs but found Chanda Ki Doli suitable 

 for the title.

 Sonu is pleased with the marketing 

 blitzkrieg around his new album, aided by a collaboration 

 between Sony and T-Series. Its high time India 

 did something about its dying music industry to bring it 

 back to its feet. Such marketing tie-ups are essential to 

 enlighten people about what you are doing. Everyone has 

 to come together to promote music in a big way.

 Inspired idols

 The two-hour special Sonu concert, 

 to be aired on Sony on June 10 at 8 pm, will feature Indian 

 Idol finalists Abhijeet Sawant, Amit Sana, Prajakta 

 Shukre and Aditi Paul coming together on a single platform 

 to pay tribute to their former judge. 

 The concert will also have another 

 finalist Rahul Vaidya anchoring the show while popular characters 

 from Kaisa Yeh Pyar Hai ? Angad, Kripa and Amit Tandon 

 ? will put up a performance.

 For Sonu, it is a dream come true 

 to see struggling singers finding a foothold in the industry. 

 Its a big relief. These days, people do not 

 have to go through the kind of struggles and humiliations 

 that we have had to undergo. This whole gundagardi 

 within the music industry has to be eliminated. Their concept 

 is since they have struggled, everyone has to struggle. 

 We have had to go through all this for 14 years and now, 

 finally there are platforms like Indian Idol which 

 create stars and not just winners.

 Filmi funda

 While Chanda Ki Doli is 

 Sonus sole thrust at the moment, he is equally charged 

 up about his film singing assignments. Parineeta, 

 Paheli, Bunty Aur Babli ? all my three songs 

 in the three films have been huge hits. I have been very 

 selective and exclusive with my songs in films. And I am 

 very happy the way things have gone.

 The mans filmi connections 

 do not end there. The Sony documentary, to be telecast from 

 June 6 to 9 daily at 8.30 pm, will see the likes of Shah 

 Rukh Khan and Aishwarya Rai talking about Sonu and the impact 

 his singing has had on their lives and film careers. 

 Both Aishwarya and Shah 

 Rukh are very nice people. I am really looking forward to 

 hear their comments in the documentary. All I can say is 

 that I am really touched by their special appearances.

 Passing point

 For all those Sonu fans who have 

 had to rely on cheap filmi gossip and rumour mills 

 to know about the singers personal life, The Making 

 of a Star will showcase his take on relationships, 

 love and the controversies that have plagued him over 

 the years. Im okay with my personal life coming 

 out in the open, he admits. 

 Its better that things 

 come from the horses mouth rather than me being misquoted 

 by the media.

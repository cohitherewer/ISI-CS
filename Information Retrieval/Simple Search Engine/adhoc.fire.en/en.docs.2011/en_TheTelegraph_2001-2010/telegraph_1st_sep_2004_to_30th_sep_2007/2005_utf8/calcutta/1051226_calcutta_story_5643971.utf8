 Day, or night, of DJs

 There?s a mad scramble in the countdown to New Year?s eve. Not just for party places or entry passes. But for melody-makers who?ll make the city dance to their tune.

 With too many song-and-dance parties lined up and too few DJs to set the mood, every table turner worth his tune ? expert and apprentice alike ? is booked for the evening of December 31. The regular DJ brigade, not numbering more than a dozen, is being backed up by those taking their lessons in console control as event managers and party organisers go on a desperate DJ hunt.

 The reason for demand outstripping supply lies in the numbers ? a sudden spurt in year-end parties, from star hotels to night clubs, from clubs to terraces.

 ?The number of big parties in the city this December 31st has almost doubled from last year?s. Then, there are many parties that are not on a very big scale, with people who cannot afford to pay for a big bash pooling in for a terrace party,? says DJ Vicky.

 The one thing that any New Year party, big or small, would need is a DJ. So, the party people have started signing up DJs suited to their budget weeks in advance. ?They have even picked up boys who are still learning DJ-ing in various institutions,? adds Vicky, waiting to rock a private party at The Hyatt Regency.

 For those making music, it?s a great chance to begin the year on a high. If the top-rung DJs will be pocketing anything between Rs 1 lakh and Rs 1.5 lakh, their proteges will be making a neat Rs 25,000 to Rs 40,000 for a few hours of frenzy.

 ?The pay packet for a fresher on New Year?s eve depends on whether he has the equipment or not. If he carries his equipment, he gets paid up to Rs 40,000. If not, it?s something between Rs 25,000 and Rs 30,000,? says DJ Harish of Dublin.

 For first-timers, next Saturday night could be make or break. ?I enrolled myself at DJ-ing school earlier this year and I am playing for a building complex party in Ballygunge. The pay is good and I?ll gain some valuable experience of handling a big crowd all by myself,? says Rahul Sha, an aspiring DJ.

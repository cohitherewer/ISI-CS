 Tourist robbed near zoo

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A South Korean tourist was robbed of $200 and 100,000 Won, the Korean currency, by a group in front of Alipore zoo on Sunday afternoon. 

 The group decamped with his wallet, in which, apart from the cash, there were traveller?s cheques for $1,000 and 400,000 Won.

 The tourist lodged a complaint with Alipore police station, but no arrest was made till Monday night.

 According to police, the incident took place when Jiewoong Lee was waiting outside the zoo for a cab. He was on his way to a Sudder Street hotel.

 ?Since yesterday was a holiday, there was quite a crowd outside the gate,? said Ranvir Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 In his complaint, Lee said a group of 10 young men were standing around him. 

 ?They started jostling with him when he, along with a large group of tourists, came out of the zoo. He did not suspect anything,? said an officer of Alipore police station.

 Lee realised that he had been robbed when he checked the pockets of his trouser.

 ?The wallet in my pocket was gone. The group of men, all in their mid-20s, had disappeared. Apart from the money, an identity card issued by the South Korean government and a train ticket to Puri were in the wallet,? he mentioned in his complaint.

 Police said Lee was robbed by a professional gang active in the area. Raids were conducted in several areas on Monday for Lee?s wallet. The tourist has left for Puri.

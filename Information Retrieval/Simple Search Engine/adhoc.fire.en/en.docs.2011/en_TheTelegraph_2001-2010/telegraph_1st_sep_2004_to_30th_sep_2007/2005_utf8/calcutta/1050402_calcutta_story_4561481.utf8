 Art for art?s sake

 Born of the uninhibited excursions of a fluid, non-assertive mind, the paintings of John Tun Sein give an impression of the infinite possibilities contained within the finite boundaries of pictorial surfaces. His art offers no objective surveys of the visible world or subjective interpretations of human affairs. Rather, his works represent a serene, meditative mode of art, which, though striking in its randomness, possesses an autonomy that does not seek affiliations with meanings outside itself. His on-going exhibition, Colour Fields, has works painted on various surfaces like canvas, board and paper, using acrylic paint, pigment powder, Fevicryl and stainers to stimulate visions of an imaginary world and translating feelings and emotions into a visual language. Dominated by the colours of the earth, the terracotta taches of his present group of works provide a palpable layer that serves as a ground for his spatial navigations. In fact, Tun Seins journey in art effortlessly transcends limits imposed by geography, society and culture.

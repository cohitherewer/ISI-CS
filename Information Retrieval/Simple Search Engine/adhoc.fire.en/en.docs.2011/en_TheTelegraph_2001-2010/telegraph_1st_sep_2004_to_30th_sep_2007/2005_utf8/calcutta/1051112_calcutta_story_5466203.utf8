 Big screen beckons again

Eye on Calcutta

 Calcutta may not be Cannes or Venice but the long queues and the animated discussions of movie buffs make our film festival just as unique

 How can any eye on Calcutta forget to take cognizance of the greatest visual experience that the city gives to its public eye every year ?its Film Festival ? a maelstrom of moving pictures from around the world that hits Nandan every November? As it is, activities, especially cultural ones, are on the rise as the temperature goes down post-Diwali. Even in its history, the city celebrated its great cultural and musical soirees in the stately mansions of the baboos of Calcutta around this time of the year. Even the balmy summer evenings with its southern breeze did not attract as much cultural fanfare in the gardens and courtyards of the rich and the famous. A cynical friend of mine maintains that the ostentatious baboos chose this time of the year to display their splendid jamewars which they cared for as much as they did the nuances of Hindusthani classical music.

 Whatever it is, the Kolkata Film Festival, through more than two decades of its history has been part of the city?s rich and bustling cultural calendar. It has achieved a stature and a distinction among non-competitive festivals that is unique in this part of the world, and attracts participants from as far away as South America. Last year even Ecuador and Venezuela, which are clearly not famous for their films, was represented. 

 Beyond the major International Film Festival of India hosted annually by the Government of India, now permanently in Goa, there is no other city that plays host to so many films and so many filmmakers in any other city in the sub-continent. Yes, the Kolkata Film Festival has gone through its ups and downs, it has had its good years and its bad ones, it has its detractors and its die-hard supporters. But there is no one, on either side of any fence who can deny the depth and subtlety with which it defines the city?s cultural interest and its everlasting love for the magic of the movies. 

 Though time and circumstance has made Mumbai the centre of India?s film industry, shared justifiably with Chennai, Calcutta remains the centre of Indian cineastes. The extent of enthusiasm, understanding and passion for cinema that you will find in this city is still unmatched, and both filmmakers and film-lovers from elsewhere in India readily accept this as an undisputed fact. It is not entirely a coincidence that this is the city that created India?s first film society, had its early pioneers in people like Hiralal Sen and Dhiren Ganguly, and also nurtured the great Satyajit Ray and Ritwik Ghatak. Calcutta has always loved films, even if it is not always making the best ones. The success of the Kolkata Film Festival is almost cognate with the success of its now-internationally famous Book Fair, which has probably the largest attendance and patronage anywhere in the world. Like a good read, Calcutta equally loves its good viewing and its good listening. 

 About five years back, when Gillo Pontecorvo, a distinguished filmmaker whom the world knows as the creator of classics like The Battle of Algiers and Quemada, and as the former director of the Venice Film Festival, came to the Kolkata Film Festival to be present at his own Retrospective, he was both shocked and delighted by the undiluted enthusiasm and the numbers here.

 Increasingly, this is becoming more and more difficult to understand, since the Kolkata Film Festival has insubstantial contribution to make in terms of the Great Indian Film Bazaar, and commercial transactions here are marginal, if at all. All over the world though, film festivals now succeed as marketplaces first, and secondly as windows to good cinema. Cannes or Venice no longer showcase the best. Often it just is a vehicle for the biggest and the most expensive.

 What is it then that makes the Kolkata Film Festival so unique in the international calendar of festivals? More than anything else, it is the spirit, the long queues, the number of people who see films standing all the way, and the level of animated discussions that take place formally and, more so, informally on the Nandan campus. From the would-be to the has-been, everyone who has had anything to do with pictures that move, seem to there in Nandan throughout this week in November. Once again proving that Calcutta has a way with cultures and there is something that continues to make it tick. Where else In India would you find a chief minister who takes time off from his busy schedule to enquire about details of the Festival?s planning and execution? Nandan is certainly Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s pet project, but the Kolkata Film Festival is equally his precious progeny. 

 Going to Nandan at this time of the year is about a lot more than just films. It is a way to feel the pulse of the people, to get a sense of the cultural waves that are brewing, and of the future movements which we shall see reflected either at the Book Fair ahead or at the film festival next year. Thoughts, ideas and attitudes are expressed, respected and taken serious note of here, because many of the cultural elements that take root through the rest of the year find their seeds sown right here and now. So to be away from Nandan is to be away from the scene of the action, especially the action that is on its way.

 I will not dwell on the festival programmes this year, because to even begin talking about it is to open an inexhaustible treasure trove. But I would like to remind readers that there are many corners of the festival which hold the rarest of gems, that are often ignored. The first one to foray into are the retrospectives, the collection of films from great masters of yesteryear. You may be able to catch films you have read extensively about but have never seen, or you might discover a largely ignored work of a maestro. Also, take a look at the short films section that runs at the Bangla Akademi at the end of the Nandan campus. These short fiction films are often the showcase for great experimental work from different corners of the world. I am sure that you will not regret seeing any of them. 

 Whether you are a film buff, a culture freak, or a talk buff, do take a cup of coffee at the Nandan campus, walk through or just stand around to hear meaningful scraps of conversations that will open out great windows of ideas and information on what is happening in other corners of the planet. So here?s to great films, great ideas, and great experiences, both visual and otherwise at the Kolkata Film Festival, our very own Chhobi Mela as it is often affectionately called.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 It?s a pity that certain stretches of the footpath around Raj Bhavan are not in good condition. Pedestrians are forced to face much inconvenience while walking down these pavements after dark. I request the Calcutta Municipal Corporation to take up repairs on the footpaths at the earliest.

 Nowadays, most post offices in the city give out the interest of the monthly income (MI) scheme in Rs 500 notes. Single, elderly people, who are dependant on this money, face much difficulty while buying small items against these currency notes. Can the postal authorities arrange for more Rs 100 notes for such customers?

 Dinabandhu Mukherjee, 

 Behala. 

 The sub-divisional court compound in Serampore is in a bad shape. In 1985, the civic body had planned to clean the premises. Sports minister Subhas Chakraborty even laid a foundation stone of a swimming pool. However, there is no sign of the swimming pool yet. The foundation stone on the bank of a filthy pond makes mockery of the promises made. I request the state judicial department and Serampore Municipality to clean up the court compound. At least, the dirty pond should be cleaned and saplings should be planted on the premises. 

 A.F. Kamruddin Ahmed Kazi,

 Hooghly.

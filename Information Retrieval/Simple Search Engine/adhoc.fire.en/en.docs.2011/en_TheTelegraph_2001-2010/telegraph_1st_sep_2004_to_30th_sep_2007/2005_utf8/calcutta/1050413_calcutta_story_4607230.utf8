The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Hawkers defiant on chaos

 - Court survey team, three men short, mobbed and sent back 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 We have been functioning like this for the past 25 years, and the pedestrians have grown used to it. We pay the union regularly. Why don?t you mind your own business?

 That was the standard response from hawkers faced by a high court-appointed committee, out on the streets again on Tuesday to study traffic management. 

 Of the five members, advocates Aurobindo Chatterjee and Debashish Kar Gupta were preoccupied, and deputy commissioner (traffic) Arun Kumar Sharma was absent for the second day in a row. 

 Advocates Tapas Kumar Bhanja and Subroto Mookherjee were the only two members who did the rounds.

 The two, however, had to call it a day after they were mobbed by a group of hawkers on Brabourne Road.

 The team inspected Strand Road, Netaji Subhas Road and Brabourne Road to witness the fallout, if any, of Monday?s visit. The members were astounded that the hawkers who had encroached upon pavements produced ?identity cards? issued by the Bengal Hawkers? Union. 

 They claimed that the cards were ?permits?, allowing them to run businesses from the pavements.

 Desai, a hawker on Brabourne Road, flatly told the team: ?Your survey is not going to make any difference. Besides, hawkers have also encroached upon pavements in the Gariahat and New Market areas. Why don?t you go there?? 

 A hawker on Strand Road admitted that union leaders collected money from them every evening, in return for an assurance that they would not be ?disturbed? by police.

 As the lawyers moved to Strand Road, they witnessed a series of lorries parked on the pavement on one side. On the other side, shops had spilled over on to the footpath. On the same stretch, a motley group of hawkers had further eaten into the space for pedestrians. 

 Under the Brabourne Road flyover, vehicles were parked on one side and handcarts and cycle-vans on the other, creating a bottleneck. 

 On Armenian Street and Brabourne Road, the lawyers later said, the pavements hardly have any space left for pedestrians. 

 A shopkeeper had no answer when the team members asked him why he had converted a part of the footpath into a godown. Just then, Shankar Banerjee, a pedestrian, tripped on a pile of plastic buckets. ?There is no space for us to move,? Banerjee complained to the lawyers.

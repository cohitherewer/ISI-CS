 Treasure trunk

SANGITA SULTANIA G. ROY

 Shrinking living spaces call for miniature storage space. The traditional chest of drawers for one, has achieved Bonsai proportions to sit pretty on desk tops and dressing tables. 

 The wooden structure holding two to four tiny ceramic drawers, however, is more decorative than utilitarian. The drawers, that look more like toy kitchen ware, are only good enough to hold knick-knacks like stationery, cosmetics, trinkets? just about anything you?d want to find handy during those rush hours.

 How much

Rs 575 to Rs 880

The quaint object, with colourful floral patterns on the drawers fitted with brass knobs, helps lend a touch of class to any corner of the house you put it in. Dressing tables, study or work stations, mantelpiece and even kitchen or bathrooms hold them quite well. 

 One has to take care to keep the chest out of the reach of children though, as the porcelain drawers are breakable and fit rather loosely in the wooden frame. The structure is also quite wobbly and should sit in a safe place. The chests make excellent house-warming gifts for those looking beyond wall hangings and showpieces.

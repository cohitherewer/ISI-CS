 Decor dreams, just for kids

A peek into the fun-filled world of kids furnishings. Thats what Peek-a-Boo, an exhibition being held on the fourth floor of Forum till December 20, is all about. On offer are things that you might require to do up your kids room in the most innovative ways.

 The exhibition brought to town by Chennai-based designer Garima Agarwal, is showcasing some simply amazing curtains, blinds and sheers, cushions, bedspreads and rugs in vibrant hues and innovative designs.

 My products are done in a way that they are appealing as well as educative. For instance, my curtains often have designs like trains and ladybugs on them. The train compartments double as pockets where kids can easily keep their daily knick-knacks. The dots on the bugs body can help children involve themselves in counting activities. Before doing up a kids room, I always interact with him or her, find out what he/she really wants and only then go ahead. That is where the exclusivity of my work lies, says Garima.

 The bedspreads and rugs come in relatively plain designs so that they go well with the grandness of the curtains and cushions. The fabrics used are very fine in nature, to avoid any skin irritation or allergy. 

 A lot of effort goes into creating each piece as most of them are hand-embroidered and has to be done with a lot of care, Garima smiles.

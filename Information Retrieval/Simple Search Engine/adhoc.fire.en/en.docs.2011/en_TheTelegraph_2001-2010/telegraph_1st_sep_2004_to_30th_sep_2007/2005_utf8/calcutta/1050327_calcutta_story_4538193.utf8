 Some rocking Raas Leela heralded Holi fun at Saturday Club on Thursday evening. A troupe from Mathura specialising in the dance form was the cynosure of all eyes. 

 However, the dialogues and songs were in the local language of Mathura and one was sure to miss out on interesting details if not careful. 

 Spring song

 Nightlong festivities peppered with folk music, lots of sweets and thandai was on the pre-Holi roster at Hindusthan Club. 

 ?Holi is a community affair which cannot be celebrated inside the four walls of your house. Bashes like these help people bond in keeping with the spirit of the festival,? said a spokesperson of the club. 

 The family crowd, dressed in ethnic best, grooved to popular Bollywood numbers. A dance troupe helped enliven matters more with its performance to tracks like Aaj rapat jaaye, Rang barse bheege chunarwali and more. 

 Post-song and dance, it was Jimmy Moses?s (better known as Johnny Lever?s younger brother) turn to tickle the funny bone. From Banta Singh and Bengali babus, to Gujarati bhaiyas and Bihari babus, everybody was the object of ridicule. Raas Leela also formed part of the revelry. 

 Farewell party

 It?s just a few more days of fun for Calcutta?s party people addicted to the sounds and sights of the first ever sports bar of the city, Winning Streak. The 80-seater bar is closing shop after a decade-long existence. And a farewell party on Sunday promises to take Winning Streak loyalists on a nostalgia trip for one last time before the gates close on March 31. 

 The venue has been the weekend haunt of Calcutta?s youth since 1994, when it used to be called Anticlock. It was rechristened as Winning Streak in 2001 with a theme bar and sports gear d?cor. This became the hangout zone for Calcutta?s hot and happening ? from Bhaichung Bhutia and his fellow footballers to Tollywood show-stoppers June, Debasree and Pallavi ? everyone converged there to down a few drinks, relax and play pool. 

 For some, like DJ Vicky, the Sunday event looks set to culminate on a poignant note. ?We will bid adieu to Winning Streak with tears in our eyes,? said the DJ, whose music has evolved during his decade-long stint with the night club.

 As Kerala celebrates Onam, the festive flavours are trickling into Calcutta, as well. Tamarind, for one, has started an eight-day-long Onam food festival.

 The south Indian speciality restaurant on Sarat Bose Road has served up a virtual tour of gods own country for the occasion.

 Right at the entrance, decked in festive finery, is the cut-out of a giant tusker. The floor is decorated in colourful patterns with flowers of the season, just as women in Kerala decorate their doorstep during Onam.

 Dolls in Mohiniattam attire are placed strategically on every table top. Even the buffet table resembles a life-sized snake boat and is set against a backdrop image of lush green backwaters with coconut trees galore. 

 Says Shweta Ishaque, co-owner of the restaurant: This is part of our ongoing efforts to present the true colours and flavours of south India and to illustrate the diverse cuisine of the region.

 On offer is an exhaustive spread of the traditional feast, popularly called Sadhya, a complete vegetarian fare laid out for both lunch and dinner. 

 The menu consists of curries like Aviyal, Beetroot Pachedi, Beans Thoran, Uli Theeyal, Vegetable Stew, Kalan (raw banana), Parippu (dal), Malabar Sambar, Rasam, rise and curd.

 As accompaniments, one gets to choose from banana chips, tapioca chips, Inji Curry, lemon pickle, mango pickle and pappadam. To round off the meal there are two traditional desserts ? Pal Payasam and Paripu Payasam (made from dal and gur). 

 For those wanting to heighten the ethnic experience, there is also the option of food being served on a banana leaf. 

 Says chef S. Kannan: We have selected the menu keeping in mind the fare cooked by families in Kerala, so that there is no compromising the authenticity of the fare. 

 The festival was flagged off by Bollywood singer Babul Supriyo and Tollywood actress Chandreyee Ghosh. There are very few places where you get authentic south Indian food and Tamarind is one of them. I make it a point to drop in whenever I am in Calcutta, said Babul.

 The Onam food festival is on till September 18 and the traditional feast comes at Rs 175 per platter.

 Tart talk

 Do you know your tarts from your flans? Do you know where flans originated from? To munch on an extensive variety of tarts, tartlets, flans and pies, and to gather some food fundas on the way, head for the Bakery at Hyatt Regency.

 There are some basic differences between tarts, flans and pies that the common foodie is unaware of, says pastry chef Bikramjit Singh Sandhu. So apart from pampering your taste buds, Bakery intends to give its clients the opportunity to enjoy the authentic tastes while gaining an insight into how different the savouries are from each other.

 Chef Sandhu explains: Tarts are pastry cases filled before or after baking with savoury or sweet ingredients. The tart section unleashes diverse delights like Blueberry Tart, Blackberry Tart, Cherry Franjipane Tart, Banana Coconut Tart, Ricotta Amritto Tart, Amereti Di Mandorle and Marble Tarts. 

 For the calorie conscious, the fruit tarts are appropriate choices. The fruit content is almost 70 per cent, claims San dhu. Those interested in traditional fare can enjoy Cheese Tarts (a speciality of northern and eastern France) and tarts with fillings of apples and pears that are popular in western France.

 Tartlets are miniatures, made in the same way that a large tart is made and including the same fillings. Those with fillings of fruit cream and sweet mixtures are suitable as desserts, whereas the savoury tartlets make for suitable hors d oeuvres or small entr?s, he explains.

 From Wine Soaked Apple Tartlets to Red Wine Pear Tartlets, one has quite a variety to choose from.

 If you are eager to revel in some yesteryear bites, then the Pear Flan, Plum Flan or Kiwi Flan just might be your choice. Derived from the old French floan and medieval Latin flado, flans date back centuries, says the chef.

 Thats not all. The mouth-watering pies will leave you craving for more. There are American specialities like Chicken Pie, Kidney Pie and Oyster Pie, which could be part of a carnivorous main course. Vegetarian delicacies include Potato Coriander Pie and Date Pie.

 Prices range upwards of Rs 55. The promotion continues till September 18.

 Prawn platter

 With three weeks left for the Puja spread to be laid out, with what does the gourmet spice up the wait? Prawns are an option for residents of Jodhpur Park, Lake Gardens and Golf Green.

 Shanghai, the cosy eatery that opened its doors two years ago at 255/2 Jodhpur Park, is hosting a prawn festival. 

 The reasonable pricing is the USP of the festival. Prawn dishes are hard to come by at less than Rs 100 anywhere. Here, I am offering everything in prawn, not shrimps, at around Rs 60 a dish. This may mean little or no profit for me, but customers will surely come to taste our offerings, explains proprietor Nilanjan Halder. 

 New prawn options added to the menu for the festival include dishes like Lemon Prawn, Prawn Cutlet and Szechwan Prawn.

 Families get a welcome soft drink on the house. If we get a good response, we will continue the festival till the Pujas, says Halder. 

 Shanghai also specialises in pork and Szechwan items. Our cook makes the specific sauces himself, which ensures an authentic taste, he adds.

 The restaurant has plans of expansion before the Pujas and a place has been identified near Aurobindo Seva Kendra for a new 50-seater eatery.

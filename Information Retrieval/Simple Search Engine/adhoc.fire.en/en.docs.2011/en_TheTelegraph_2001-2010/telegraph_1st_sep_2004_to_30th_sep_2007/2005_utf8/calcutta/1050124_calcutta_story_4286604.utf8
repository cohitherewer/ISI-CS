The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 ?Black Friday doesn?t point fingers at anybody?

(From top) The Mumbai blast as shown in Black 

Friday, a Paanch promotion poster, another moment from Black Friday, 

and director Anurag Kashyap 

 He has been the most-written-about director to have not had a single release under his belt. His Paanch hasn?t released yet and ANURAG KASHYAP has moved on to write scripts and dialogues for other directors. This Friday should see the release of his directorial debut if the TADA court has no other plans. The Black Friday director speaks to Pratim D. Gupta about the film and his sense of cinema.

 After all these years, you will finally 

see your film release at the theatres. How do you feel?

 Relieved. With the sense of relief is a sense of anxiety. People within the industry have written so much about Paanch and now about Black Friday, that I am very anxious to know what the real audience feels about the film. Finally, I would know how and where I stand.

 How will you sell Black Friday?

 Black Friday is a film based on facts. It is about the 1993 Mumbai riots, an anatomy of the police investigation, how it happened, how it was planned.

 How honest is the film to the book, 

it is based on, and how honest is the book to the Mumbai riots?

 The book has been keenly followed. The film doesn?t show everything that?s there in the book but everything that?s there in the film is there in the book. We couldn?t show so many arrests in the film. So we used police chases as metaphors for those arrests. At places in the film, where we just have a situation in the book, we have imagined the possible dialogue exchanges and put them like that. The book in itself is a journalist?s view of things. In the film, everything?s captured and nothing?s recreated. Black Friday begins with the blasts and then explores the facts that come out of the investigations.

 Don?t you have anything to say with 

Black Friday like with Paanch?

 As a director, I am not trying to make any statement or point fingers at anybody. The film just starts and ends with the Gandhian theory ? an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.

 You have shot at real locations. 

How could you maintain the 1993 look?

 It has been very difficult to maintain the 1993 look. It?s been more difficult than a period film. The billboards on the streets are mostly those of satellite channels and mobile phones. The post-globalisation effect was very tough to get rid of. The only car on the Mumbai streets in 1993 was Maruti Esteem which is almost impossible to find these days. We tried our best to cover up the billboards and shot at places like Dongri, Mahim and Bahrampada, where there have been very little changes. We also had a man handy always who could stop a person from bringing out a cell phone from his pocket. It was very well co-ordinated.

 Who is your target audience? How 

will you classify Black Friday?

 We have tried to bring out the human angle in the film. It has met with a very positive response in festivals like Locarno and Pusan and also the overseas arthouse market. There?s one question everyone has ? is the film art or commercial? I don?t believe in that distinction. I believe in good and bad cinema. We are targeting everyone. I believe that a film based on facts can attract one and all. The film has no stars or songs, which is the standard recipe for a commercial film. But if the music sales are anything to go by, people should come to watch Black Friday.

 Why this apathy towards stars?

 Stars do no fall in my scheme of things. I have to shoot at real locations and they cannot do so. Also, they come with an image. In a film like Black Friday, where there are no central characters and nobody has a role for more than 35-40 minutes, I could not afford to have stars with images. And they don?t even look like real people. Take Shah Rukh Khan ? he has looked like a real man for the first time in Swades. And only Ashutosh Gowariker with a Lagaan under his belt could manage that.

 How kind have the censors been this 

time?

 They didn?t say a thing. They reacted to the film just like others. Yes, there were a couple of sound cuts but that was completely justified. Those were ma-behen gaalis.

 Why did you choose Indian Ocean 

to do the music?

 I am a big fan of Indian Ocean. I also used their music in Paanch. Their kind of music works phenomenally for a film like Black Friday. The CDs have been selling really well and the album is climbing up the charts. That only proves their following.

 You write scripts and dialogues 

for other film-makers. How do you decide which film you want to direct?

 I do things very naturally and instinctively. If I read or see something exciting, I take it up. Unlike others who think a lot before venturing into something, I just go by my instincts and see where it takes me.

 What is the status with Paanch?

 It?s been bought over by Sahara and Boney Kapoor. It should release after Bewafaa.

 What else are your working on?

 I have written the dialogues for Deepa Mehta?s Water, Harry Baweja?s Main Aisa Hi Hoon and the German film Valley of Flowers. As for my own directorial venture, I want to do Gulal next, which is a love story set in Rajasthan against the backdrop of college politics. But I have to get hold of my funds first.

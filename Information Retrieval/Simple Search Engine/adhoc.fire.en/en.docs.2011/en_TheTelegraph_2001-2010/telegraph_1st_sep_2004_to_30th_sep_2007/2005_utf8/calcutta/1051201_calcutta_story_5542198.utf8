 Celebration with vibrant hues

 When this 45-year-old national chain first set up shop in Calcutta on November 28, 2002, the kurta crowd and more queued up at the 16, Hindusthan Road address. Many were curious onlookers wanting to check out what the new store was offering.

 Three years down the line, FabIndia is the store Calcuttans swear by when it comes to ethnic products of most kinds, be it clothes, upholstery, pottery or even gift items.

 This is evident from the fact that footfall at the store has witnessed a surge ? 15 times ? over the past 36 months. 

 And to celebrate its third birthday in town, FabIndia has unveiled its celebration collection in home furnishings (bed and table linen) and decor items like lamps, pottery and the like.

 The one thing that marks the new range of products is its vibrancy of colours. Most of our previous stuff was in sober shades, but people want more adventure now. Keeping the changing taste of Calcuttans in mind, the new range has a lot of blue, red, turquoise and orange in various new and innovative designs. Our latest products are also characterised by colours fast and anti-shrink, says store manager Pallabi Basu.

 Some of the eye-catching items on offer include Tussar and Ikkat bedsheets and cushion covers, Chanderi table cloths, curtains and table mats. Prices of these products begin at Rs 300.

 A whole range of new lampshades in cane, wood and paper priced at Rs 250-plus can go on to add that element of real style to your homes.

 And for those looking for the perfect gift items, the store has a host of lovely scented candles in various hues, priced at Rs 50-plus.

 On the third birthday of this store, we really want to thank Calcuttans for their support and loyalty, Basu smiles.

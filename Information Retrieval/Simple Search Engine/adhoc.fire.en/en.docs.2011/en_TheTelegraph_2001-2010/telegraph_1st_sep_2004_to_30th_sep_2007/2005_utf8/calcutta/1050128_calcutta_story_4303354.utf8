 Boutique bests at hospitality hub

Sangita Sultania G. Roy takes a 

walk through The Park corridors to explore the nuances that helped the hotel bag 

a prestigious award

Welcome to hotels with a point of view. If you go by Ian Schrager, a German hotelier?s definition, boutique hotels are the latest buzz in the hospitality industry. The Morgans Hotel in Manhattan spawned the trend in 1984 with comfort, innovative, contemporary, individualistic and stylish being the keywords that differentiates this brand of hospitality from its more stiff counterparts.

 The trend of boutique hotels spread to well-known names in the industry like The Raffles (Singapore), Royalton (New York), The Mercer (New York), Costes (Paris) and The Park, Calcutta. Yes, the city hotel better known for its entertainment hubs ? Someplace Else and Tantra ? has been awarded the National Tourism Award for the year 2003-2004 for outstanding performance as the Best Boutique hotel in the country by the Government of India, Department of Tourism.

The minister of state for tourism, Renuka Chowdhary, presented the award to Priya Paul, chairperson, Apeejay Surrendra Park Hotels and Deepak Bali, vice president, The Park Hotels, at a ceremony in New Delhi on January 25. Speaking on the occasion, Vijay Dewan, managing director of the hotel, said, ?Globally, travellers are following new needs and visions, in search of personal answers, beauty, miracles and secrets. In this search, our senses are sharper than ever to the power of an aesthetic environment and the messages in design.?

 The little speech translates into distinctive architecture, unusual design elements and luxurious comfort that distinguishes a boutique hotel from more staid options. Attention to small details like providing a 15-inch duvet with a bed and five different kinds of pillows for more luxury, apart from terracotta and kantha panels in rooms and a liberal sprinkling of art throughout the hotel, is the secret behind their success reveals Salmoli Mukerji, director public relations, The Park, Calcutta. 

 ?It?s all about style and presentation while keeping up with the trend in the business worldwide,? says Salmoli, citing the example of contemporary decor used in Saffron, the Pan-Indian restaurant at The Park. The use of cosmic motifs to denote the concept of a galaxy in the decor instead of sticking to purely Indian designs and at the same time using 12-inch plates to go with the concept of an Indian thala, are some of the ?innovations? the hotel swears by. 

 Entertainment is an area where The Park has an edge over other hotels. While Someplace Else, the pub at the hotel, enjoys the distinction of being the Mecca of live music in Calcutta, Tantra, the disco, is among the hottest night haunts in town. ?Many tourists and business executives who check into the hotel, prefer it because of its entertainment options. We have created the buzz and brought entertainment back to Park Street,? feels Salmoli. 

 Other add-ons at The Park that go with the concept of providing an experience and not just a product to the guest, include the art tour through the hotel and the heritage walk down the history lane of Calcutta, that can be arranged on request. ?We display the works of over 40 artists at the hotel, including those of Bikash Bhattacharjee, M.F. Husain, Shuvaprasanna and Yusuf Arakkal, many of which are from Priya Paul?s personal collection. A lot of guests express their desire for a guided tour of the hotel simply to see all the paintings and sculptures on display. We also provide them with background information about the artists and their works. Besides, foreigners just love the heritage tour that takes them through the history of Calcutta,? details Salmoli. 

 Other special touches include providing bean bags and low seating in a section of Tantra, christened the Santra Room due to its predominantly orange colour theme. ?This was the first informal lounge in the city. You can safely say we brought the concept of lounging to Calcutta, which the other nightclubs in the city are trying to emulate today,? claims Salmoli. More ?thoughtful gestures? like providing a variety of juices during tea breaks in the banquet hall, which are usually sombre corporate affairs, helps make The Park ?boutique?. The decor at the banquets is also on the peppier side. ?Banquets are usually very stark and boring, but we have used a lot of reds and blues and used glass and steel to pleasing effect,? adds Salmoli. 

 The consumer is clearly the king and the treatment only gets more regal!

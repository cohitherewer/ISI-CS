 Lalbazar lines dead in late-night snag 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 More than 15 telephone connections at the Lalbazar police headquarters went out of order for over 12 hours from late on Monday following a cable fault. 

 City police chief Prasun Mukherjee?s direct phone also went dead from Tuesday morning. The phone lines, including those of the OC control room and traffic control room, were out of reach till Tuesday noon. 

 Blaming service provider BSNL for the incident, senior officials said: ?Taking into count Tuesday?s incident, the telecommunication network at Lalbazar has collapsed over three times in the past six months. BSNL should have been more careful about the lines connecting the police headquarters with the rest of the city.?

 A BSNL official, however, said the disruption was the outcome of a cable fault and there was no negligence on their part. ?The fault has already been repaired and we are trying our level best to provide disruption-free service to the police headquarters,? he said.

 According to the police officers, it was around 11.40 pm on Monday when all telephone lines in both the control rooms went out of order. 

 ?We were literally out of people?s reach. We informed BSNL but no action on its part was seen,? said an official of the OC control room.

 The second phase of the disruption occurred around 8 am on Tuesday. ?This time, the direct line of the police commissioner went out of order. We again informed BSNL and urged it to take steps on an emergency basis,? said an official of the traffic control room.

 Experts from BSNL arrived around 9 am and took more than an hour to zero down on the exact problem. ?There was a fault in the underground cable line in front of the police headquarters. Whatever time we took to restore service was the minimum required for such repair work,? a senior BSNL official pointed out.

 Banibrata Basu, joint commissioner of police (traffic), who oversees the telecommunication network of the police headquarters, voiced his displeasure at the frequency of such disruptions. 

 ?We have experienced three such incidents in the past six months. I had written to the BSNL authorities on January 14 after a similar incident, requesting them to take preventive measures to avoid such disruption. I will write to BSNL again,? he said.

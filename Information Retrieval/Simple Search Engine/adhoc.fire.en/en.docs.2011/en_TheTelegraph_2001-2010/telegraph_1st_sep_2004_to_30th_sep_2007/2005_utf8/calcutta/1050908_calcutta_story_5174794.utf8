 Festivals mean fun and frolic, festivals mean flaunting new dresses, shoes and accessories? In keeping with this mood of celebration, Diwansons Jewellers at Siddha Point on Park Street has come up with a sizzling festive collection called Arth.

 As the name suggests, the jewellery line promises to add a whole new meaning to beauty and elegance. The collection is sure to lend a different dimension to individual fashion statements, be it traditional or contemporary, claims Vikash Diwan of Diwansons.

 The collection is an assortment of earrings, neckpieces, maangtikas and bajubandhs in interesting designs and motifs. The bangle section includes churi, mataria, suttra, patra and the haathful. 

 The adornments come in gold combined with precious and semi-precious stones. From heavy bridal ornaments to party wear, there is a wide variety to choose from.

 People often come in with a particular adornment and want to go in for accessories that match it. For them, we have the Mix and Match offer, adds Vikash.

 And its not just about pampering women either. There is an exclusive range of kurta buttons, coat pins, tie knots, bracelets, pens, cufflinks, karas and diamond-studded watches for men.

 The wedding collection starts at Rs 60,000.

 Prime time

 Jaipur Emporium at 227 AJC Bose Road has long been home to a fortune of adornments in precious and semi-precious stones reflecting the intricacies and styles of the Nizams and the Victorian age.

 The latest inclusion here is a range of ornate watches in pure gold and white gold embellished with diamonds.

 These new timepieces are being pitched as collectors items. The price range starts from Rs 20,000.

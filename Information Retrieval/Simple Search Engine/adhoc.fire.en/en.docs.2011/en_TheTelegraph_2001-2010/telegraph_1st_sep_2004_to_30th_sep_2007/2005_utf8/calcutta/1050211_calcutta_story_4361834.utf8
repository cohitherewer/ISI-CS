Bands for aid

Sound Scan

 There will be no George Michael or David Bowie 

or Bono to grace this concert, but this Band Aid hopes to recreate some of the 

healing magic of the Bob Geldof-led super effort.

City bands, both Bengali and English, are getting 

together for a concert entitled Band Aid in relief of tsunami victims on Friday. 

To be held at Nazrul Mancha, the event will host performances by bands such as 

Paraspathar, Kaya, Lakkhichhara and Fossils (picture above). 

Bangla band power would be ably matched by their hugely-popular 

English counterparts, Hip Pocket and Skinny Alley.

There will also be a special performance by classical 

artiste Subhankar Banerjee. Compositions from Banerjee?s Tabla Tale album 

will be presented. Tabla Tale is slated for release by World Music in Paris 

later this month. The Violin Brothers, Debsankar and Jyotisankar, will be a part 

of the concert.

The artistes will perform without fees and the proceeds 

from the event will be handed over to the Chief Minister?s Relief Fund in aid 

of tsunami survivors. Be there at Nazrul Mancha at 4 pm, rock to some great music 

and contribute to the noble cause. Tickets at venue.

Charity call

 While on music for a cause, a group of dedicated 

TTIS Tigers (student reporters) are also organising a concert in aid of 

tsunami victims on February 12. Bands like Aasma, Viva, Fossils, Insomnia and 

Dhwani will be playing at the La Martiniere for Boys School grounds from 5 pm. 

So be there and buy a ticket for Rs 100 to make the student effort successful.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Latino school debut

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Foreign education institutes have always held Calcutta students in high esteem. And now, a Latin American management institute has come to town, scouting for students.

 ?Indian students are well-ranked in the world. They have brilliant records and are in demand everywhere,? said Yolanda Fernandez Ochoa, MBA regional manager, Central American Institute for Business Administration (INCAE), a top B-school headquartered in Costa Rica.

 The business school offers a 21-month MBA degree in finance and economy, sustainable development and industry and technology, both in English and Spanish.

 INCAE has tied up with Pune-based Training amp; Advanced Studies in Management and Communications Ltd (TASMAC) and is seeking students from several Indian cities, including Calcutta.

 ?We were impressed with the students we interviewed in Calcutta. The final selection will be held soon,? said Ochoa. She said that a high score in GMAT or GRE, two years? working experience and a ?reasonably good? interview would see a student through the selection process.

 The 21-month course would cost $40,000. INCAE organises placement fairs on its campuses every year, post-completion of the course.

 Although INCAE has 14 branches across Latin America, India is the first country in Asia where it has a tie-up. ?In the first year, we are stressing on quality students,? explains Ochoa. The institute has, therefore, decided to take 10 students for the first year and gradually increase numbers.

 Before coming to the city, Ochoa met students in Pune and Ahmedabad and will later visit Hyderabad, Cochin, Trivandam, Bangalore and Mumbai.

 TASMAC?s joint managing director Prashant Dua said: ?TASMAC is organising the interviews and providing other infrastructural assistance.?

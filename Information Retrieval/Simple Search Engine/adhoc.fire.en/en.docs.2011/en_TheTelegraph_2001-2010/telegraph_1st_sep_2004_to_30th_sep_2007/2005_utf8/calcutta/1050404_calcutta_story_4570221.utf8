 Suicide by servant over torture 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Branded a thief, humiliated and finally locked in a room for days, Raju Sau, 27-year-old domestic help, hanged himself on Sunday morning. 

 Raju?s body was found hanging in the room, where he had been kept confined for the past few days, in his employer?s apartment on Suren Sarkar Road. As news of the suicide spread, neighbours called in the police, who went to the Phoolbagan residence and arrested four men.

 Pradip Bajaj and his brother Lalit, and their two drivers were charged with abetment to commit suicide, torture and wrongful confinement, leading to the suicide. 

 ?We have called other members of the Bajaj household for interrogation. We have to find out whether they, too, played a role in the torture of the young man,? said Jawed Shamim, deputy commissioner of police (eastern suburban division).

 Raju?s body was first noticed by the Bajaj family when one of them entered the room around 11.30 am.

 According to officers on the case, Raju, from Jharkhand, had joined the Bajaj household as domestic help two months ago. 

 ?The first few weeks passed smoothly. Trouble started early last month, after Raju?s employers, who run a transport business, found some jewellery and cash missing from their almirah,? said an officer of Phoolbagan police station. 

 ?Even though they had no evidence against Raju, the employers accused him of theft. They started torturing him brutally,? the officer added.

 During preliminary investigation on Sunday, police found out that the Bajaj family had not informed the local police station about the missing valuables. ?Instead of informing us, they tortured the youth,? said Shamim.

 According to the statement provided by another domestic help of the family and neighbours of the Bajaj family, Raju underwent a harrowing time. 

 ?The employers would beat him black-and-blue and starve him in their attempts to force him to confess. After failing to get any information out of him, they kept the youth confined in a small room,? said Shamim.

 The drivers of the Bajaj family would beat up Raju every day. ?The used to ask him the same question ? where have you kept the valuables? As Raju could not provide any answer, they would step up the torture,? said the officer, on the basis of the statement provided by neighbours.

Life

 Small talk

 If youre going to party with a vengeance this weekend to celebrate the departure of dry days, there are plenty of sizzlers to go along too, some served piping hot...

 Sania singe

 Dont pin Grand Slam hopes on the pin-up girl of Indian tennis, but do give the tennis tigress her due for going down fighting her Russian opponent, Svetlana Kuznetsova, at Wimbledon. Give her the benefit of extra doubt for being cute and competitive.

 Faria fracas

 Kicking Davis dirt after Svengate, Faria Alam, the former secretary suing the English Football Association over alleged unfair dismissal, is back in public glare over allegations of sexual harassment by her ex-boss David Davis, the associations executive director. The spicy contents of Farias explicit emails to a friend are spilling over. As the kiss-and-tell tale gets raunchier, dwell on the womans traditional Bangladeshi background and her pluck or her plot to play ball.

 Hillary hoot

 More sleaze, second helping anyone? The ghost of Clinton and Lewinsky has risen again in The Truth About Hillary: What She Knew, When She Knew It, and How Far Shell Go to Become President by Edward Klein. The book, basically an attempt to spoil Hillarys presidential chances is peppered with stuff like her being a closet lesbian. Most of it is attributed to anonymous sources, but what the heck, try and book a copy.

 Bhai Bhai

 Mere paas Industries aur IPCL hai; tumhare paas Infocomm, Energy aur Capital hai; aur hum dono ke paas ma hai! This is probably how Salim-Javed would have scripted the denouement of the most dramatic bhai vs bhai saga in recent times. The words, of course, would be spoken by Mukesh to Anil within earshot of Kokilaben Ambani. Take sides with brother elder (he is what a top-notch businessman should be) or younger (poor A, running a marathon is easier than taking on M) but dont forget to dwell on the impact that the Ambani amity had on the Sensex ? 7,000 and soaring!

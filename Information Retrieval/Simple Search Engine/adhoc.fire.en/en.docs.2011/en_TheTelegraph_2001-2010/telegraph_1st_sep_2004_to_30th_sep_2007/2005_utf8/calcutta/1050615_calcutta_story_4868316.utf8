 Will the police be pulled up by the high court for not acting on an order that eight streets in the city?s central business district be cleared of hawkers? Environment activist Subash Dutta wants as much, and he is preparing to move court with a contempt petition against the force. 

 ?One-and-a-half months have elapsed after the court order, but not a single hawker has been removed. I have no alternative but to file a contempt petition against police,? Dutta told Metro on Tuesday.

 A petition by the activist had set off a flurry of activity that ended in a ruling by the division bench of Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice Ashok Kumar Ganguly, asking police to clear the roads of hawkers and other encroachers. The order was to be effected on Strand Road, Brabourne Road, Kali Krishna Tagore Street, Rabindra Sarani, Netaji Subhash Bose Road, Mahatma Gandhi Road, Kalakar Street and AJC Bose Road. 

 ?The ruling was based on the recommendations of a five-member committee, headed by deputy commissioner (traffic) Arun Sharma. Sharma himself, being head of the traffic police, should have played a key role in executing the order,? Dutta observed.

 The division bench had ruled that after evicting the hawkers, police pickets should be deployed on the pavements to prevent the encroachers from returning.

 ?On Strand Road, the civic body was directed to erect fences to protect the footpaths from encroachment. The fencing was supposed to be completed by June 17, the day the next hearing in the case had been fixed,? Dutta recalled. 

 He said he had collected several photographs of the pavements as they are now and will produce them before the judges.

 The chief justice is now out of town. High court sources said he is likely to return on June 21. 

 ?The matter may come up for hearing on June 24. I will convey my grievances to the court on that day,? Dutta declared.

 Two other lawyers (Subroto Mukherjee and Tapas Bhanja), both members of the committee that reported to the court on the state of the eight roads, supported Dutta?s view and said they would make a similar appeal before the court.

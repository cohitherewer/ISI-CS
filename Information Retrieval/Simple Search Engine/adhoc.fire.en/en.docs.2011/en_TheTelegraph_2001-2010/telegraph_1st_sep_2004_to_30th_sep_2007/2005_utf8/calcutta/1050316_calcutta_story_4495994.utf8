 Food-and-flannels has been the formula for the two cricket teams in the run-up to the Eden Gardens Test.

 From tiger prawns to lemon mocktails to mishti doi, experiments with gastronomic truth have dominated the days that have begun early with practice sessions and ended with late-evening team meetings.

 ?After practice in the morning, the Indians park themselves in the gym, while the Pakistanis head for the swimming pool,? revealed a spokesperson for Taj Bengal, where both teams are staying.

 For breakfast, many of them come down to The Hub, while lunch and dinner are either in or ordered from speciality restaurants Sonargaon and Chinoiserie.

 ?It?s been all fruits and a whole lot of fresh juices for breakfast. They have been almost vegetarians in the morning,? said Taj executive chef Surinder Singh.

 ?But for lunch, the teams have made most of the two special food festivals, the Tiger Prawn and Tofu festival and the Kebab and Beer festival. Lobsters have fared well, and of the Indian fare, Kadhai Murg, Dal Masala and, of course, mishti doi, are popular,? he added.

 But if there was one feast fit for the cricket kings, it was at the Prince of Calcutta?s signature food stop, late on Monday. The chefs at Sourav?s had been briefed by the skipper well before Team India trooped into Prince of Cal, the fourth-floor lounge of the Park Street address.

 ?Sourav had told us the favourite dishes of some of our cricketers,? smiled Kanishka Mazumder, CEO, Sourav?s.

 ?So, we had Scampi Goan Malai Curry, Sachin Tendulkar?s favourite prawn preparation, while for vegetarians Anil Kumble and Rahul Dravid, there was Tandoori Paneer Sashlik and Dal Maharaj.?

 Also on the 12-item menu were Mutton Chapti Kebab, Murg Tikka Afghani and Kesari Pulao, rounded off with Malpoa and Rabri.

 Post-dinner, the Singhs ? Yuvraj and Harbhajan ? led an impromptu bhangra jig, with the wives of Ganguly, Dravid and V.V.S. Laxman joining in.

 There was no doubting who the hottest players on the dance floor were: stylebhai Yuvraj and high-energy Harbhajan, followed by Lakshmipathy Balaji and Irfan Pathan.

 And the hottest tracks for the night: ?Sachin?s favourites, the remix version of Dekha na hay re, socha na hay re from Bombay to Goa and Pink Floyd?s Another Brick in the Wall, and Yuvraj?s request Jahan teri ye nazar hai from Kalia.?

 If Sourav?s is the favourite haunt for the Indians, Pakistan?s Mohali hero Kamran Akmal seems to be stuck on Starstruck at Forum. 

 ?He sat at the same table and ordered the same drink, Lemon amp; Lime mocktail,? said restaurant manager Fiaz Azam of the star guest for lunch on Monday and Tuesday.

 Post-lunch, it was the Mohali centurion?s tryst with Kareena Kapoor. Kamran Akmal and friends strode straight into INOX for a matinee show of Bewafaa. ?He watched the full film,? confirmed an INOX spokesperson.

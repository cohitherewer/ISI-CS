The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Venue for diarrhoea study 

 - Modern research address with hefty Japanese aid at Beleghata

 A STAFF REPORTER

 India?s first diarrhoea research centre, aimed at devising ways to control the disease, will be set up in the city soon. The disease is the second biggest cause of infant death, after respiratory diseases.

 A four-storeyed building, equipped with all modern research facilities, will come up in a year?s time on the Beleghata premises of the Infectious Diseases Hospital, thanks to a whopping Rs 92-crore healthcare aid by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). 

 The National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Disease (NICED) will implement the project and conduct the research work at the new centre, under the aegis of the Indian Council for Medical Research. 

 ?This financial aid by JICA is the biggest grant given in recent times to a healthcare institution in the country,? said NICED director Sujit Bhattacharya, minutes after the foundation stone was laid at the project site in Beleghata.

 On an average, more than 100 children are admitted with diarrhoea in the top hospitals in and around the city, with the Beleghata ID Hospital alone accounting for 15 to 20 cases every day.

 ?Lack of a comprehensive survey has made it difficult to ascertain the exact number of diarrhoeal deaths. However, 18 per cent of all infectious diseases among children can be attributed to diarrhoea. This figure is second only to acute respiratory diseases,? explained Bhattacharya.

 The building, spread over 6,300 sq m, will have four floors. The first floor will be an exclusive ?animal house?, where research experiments will be carried out. 

 ?Keeping in mind the animal rights activities in Bengal and the concern for the way research animals are treated, we will make sure that there is no room for complaints,? the director said to allay fears.

 ?The remaining three floors will have research facilities with all modern gadgets,? said Bhattacharya. Exclusive floors for microbiology, biochemistry, virology and immunology will also be opened. 

 Once research work gets underway, officials from Indian Council for Medical Research will oversee the work through periodic visits and pump in more funds, if necessary. 

 Director of medical education C.R. Maity and Japanese consul-general Kenji Shimizu were present at the foundation stone-laying ceremony.

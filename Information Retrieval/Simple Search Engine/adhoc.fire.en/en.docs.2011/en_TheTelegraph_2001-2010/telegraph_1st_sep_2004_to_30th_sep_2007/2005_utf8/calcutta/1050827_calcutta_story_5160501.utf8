 From tiger to Tagore. From author to translator. Emmanuel Pierrat has moved on in life. Two years ago, the 37-year-old Frenchman had come to Calcutta to launch his novel La Course au Tigre (The Course of the Tiger) based on a serial hunter and his quarry, the star of the Sunderbans. This time, he is aiming bigger ? a translation of the ghost stories of Bengal?s Bard. 

 Speaking in the eerie darkness during a power cut at The French Association on Friday, the intellectual property rights lawyer explained that he was looking towards a renaissance of Tagore in French bookstores. ?The predominant version available is by Andr? Gide. But Gide knew neither Bengali nor proper English. His style is also very old-fashioned. So Tagore is getting fossilised because of him.?

 Gide remained the sole translator of most of Tagore as his publisher, Garima, owned the copyright. ?But even when the copyright era ended, no one dared to touch Tagore as Gide had done so. No one had the guts to say his was a bad job.?

 Pierrat had rediscovered Tagore during his first visit here at the age of 22 when he had chosen a posting in Calcutta for the two-year military service compulsory for French youth. ?We had to read Tagore in school in Gide?s translation, and found him quite boring. But once I picked up enough Bengali to try the original, he seemed a different author.?

 To avoid falling into the same trap as other French translators, Pierrat plans to translate from the original with the help of Bengali friends, instead of depending on an English translation. ?My English is like a Bihari peasant?s,? he grins. The polyglot, who speaks six other languages, has picked up all his English while travelling in India.

 GeneratioNext in France is apathetic to books. ?All they are interested in are American movies, reality shows on TV and video games.? Still books are important. Pierrat who writes for prominent newspapers like L?Express and Le Monde, and has his own publishing house Editions Cartouche, plans to reach 15,000 stores across France by January. ?It does not matter if it does not become a bestseller as long as it is available to people.?

 There is more than English that Pierrat is picking up from here. ?I have decided to adopt a three-year-old whom I met by chance at a Karnataka orphanage.? The paperwork is done and Kiki should be flying to her new home when he returns next year with his Tagore. ?I hope she grows up with good Bengali and not bad Kannada,? he smiles.

 Subhas boost for builders 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty on Tuesday said he would continue to support the real estate business, despite a section of his party being against it.

 ?I wholeheartedly support the real estate business, as it is viable and provides employment to the poorer section of the people,?? Chakraborty said during a function at New Town, in the presence of Union urban employment and poverty alleviation minister Kumari Selja and state housing minister Goutam Deb.

 Selja was in the township to inaugurate Greenwood Park, a joint-venture housing project of the West Bengal Housing Board and Bengal Shrachi Housing Development Ltd.

 The 400-apartment housing project in Action Area I of New Town is the third housing complex in Rajarhat.

 With an approximate built-up area of 40,000 sq m, Greenwood Park follows the public-private cross-subsidy model, with segregated domains for LIG, MIG and HIG.

 ?I am described as an agent of the promoters, since I support their business,? said minister Chakraborty at the inaugural function. 

 ?I have been involved in a number of controversies because of this. But I do not care about what people are saying, and will continue to support the real estate business, come what may,?? he asserted.

 ?I have tried my best to convince my party leaders and the chief minister that involvement of private parties in the real estate sector is essential for urban development. But even now, some have not realised it,?? he added.

 According to the minister, nearly 500,000 poor people come to the city every day in search of work as masons, painters, carpenters and daily labourers.

 ?Apart from real estate, is there any other business that can provide so many jobs every day?? minister Chakraborty demanded.

 Tortured wife kills herself after dinner 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A 42-year-old housewife, Tulu Mondol, burnt herself to death at her Sinthee home on Tuesday night. According to her brother?s complaint with the police, she used to be tortured regularly by her in-laws.

 Four persons, including Tulu?s husband Kartick, have been arrested.

 ?We have received specific complaints against the husband and in-laws. The accused have been arrested,? said Damayanti Sen, deputy commissioner of police (north). 

 ?Tulu?s brother alleged she had been suffering from depression because of constant torture, both mental and physical. Our initial investigation suggests this is a case of suicide, but more may come to light after we go through the post-mortem report,? she added.

 An officer of Sinthee police station said that like every night, Tulu on Tuesday ate dinner along with her husband and their 14-year-old son. ?No one had a whiff of what she was contemplating. After dinner, she took a can of kerosene from the kitchen and went to the bathroom. It seems she emptied the can on herself and then lit a match.?

 Tulu?s husband and other family members were alerted when they saw smoke billowing from the bathroom of the South Sinthee Road flat. The door of the bathroom was locked from inside. 

 As repeated calls to Tulu failed to draw any response, Kartick brought in neighbours, who broke open the bathroom door. The group saw the woman?s charred body on the floor. She was rushed to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, where doctors pronounced her dead. 

 Sleuths are pondering over several questions, answers to which are crucial for unravelling the exact course of events.

 ?The victim was already dead when we reached the spot. It is natural that a person will cry out when he/she gets burnt. But her husband and in-laws claim not to have heard any scream. They were alerted only on seeing smoke. This is strange,? the officer added.

 Tulu was married to Kartick Mondol, a businessman who deals in furniture, in 1987. According to her brother, who lives in Cossipore, torture for dowry started immediately after marriage.

 The woman never protested, but soon slipped into depression. She only confided in her brother. The brother took her to psychologists, but that did not ease her depression.

 Apart from Kartick, the arrests include brothers-in-law Hiren and Bhuban Mondol and sister-in-law Jharna Dutta.

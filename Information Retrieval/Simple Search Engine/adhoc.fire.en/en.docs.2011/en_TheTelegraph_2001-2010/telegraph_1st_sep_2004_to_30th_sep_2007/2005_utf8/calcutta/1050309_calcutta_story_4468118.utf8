The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 I attended the inaugural ceremony of the Park Street flyover on February 19. 

A huge pandal had been erected for the function. What surprised me is that 70 

per cent of the audience comprised schoolchildren. Perhaps, the government knew 

that not many will be interested in attending the programme which is why the kids 

were roped in. The children, I noticed, were terribly bored and tired as they 

had to sit around for hours doing absolutely nothing. Was it necessary to harass 

the children in this manner?

 I would like to share this incident at the Calcutta airport on the evening 

of February 26. I had absent-mindedly left my laptop in a trolley at the airport?s 

car park. But Pradip Ghosh a member of the Airport Taxi Operators? Association 

found it and immediately handed it over to me. I salute this act of honesty.

 Fountains and artificial ponds on the Rabindra Sadan-Nandan premises are becoming 

polluted by the day. Young couples sit around on the tiled area bordering the 

waterbodies in the evenings eating snacks and roasted peanuts. Usually, they don?t 

bother to throw the wastes and leftovers into the bins. Instead, they throw them 

in the pond. These days it is often found that plastic bottles and bags float 

in the water. Garbage is also accumulating in the north-west corner of the Rabindra 

Sadan compound. The youngsters shouldn?t be allowed to sit around the ponds. More 

garbage bins need to be installed on the premises.

 Driving on the roads of north Calcutta is a nightmare. The roads in Bowbazar 

area such as College Street, Amherst Street, MG Road, Chitpur Road, Rabindra Sarani 

and Beadon Street are some of the most potholed ones. Usually, Durga puja is the 

only time when these roads get a facelift. This year, we were denied this little 

consolation, too. Tramlines are also a major cause for the sorry state of the 

roads. While the Corporation maintains that the Calcutta Tramways Company is responsible 

for the repair of roads with tram tracks, the latter pleads lack of funds. The 

CPM wanted to remove the tramlines, but the Congress opposed the idea. While authorities 

are paying attention to the roads in south Calcutta, the north is being sadly 

neglected. Is it because VVIPs don?t ply on these stone-cobbled roads? And those 

VIPs who do stay in north Calcutta appear to be helpless on the issue. Being a 

doctor, I am concerned about the trouble patients face while travelling on these 

roads. Residents of north Calcutta should raise their voice.

 Dr I.C. Kochar, Hindustan Park.

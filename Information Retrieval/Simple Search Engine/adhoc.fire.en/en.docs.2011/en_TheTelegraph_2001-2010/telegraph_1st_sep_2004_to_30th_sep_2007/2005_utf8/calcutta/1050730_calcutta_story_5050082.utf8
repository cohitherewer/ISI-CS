 Undertrial escapes from toilet

 A STAFF REPORTER

 In another glaring example of police negligence, an undertrial prisoner escaped from custody on Friday while he was being taken back to Dum Dum Central jail from the sub-divisional judicial magistrate?s (SDJM) court at Barasat, on the city?s northern fringes.

 A fortnight ago, murder accused Sushanta Mondal managed to obtain bail from Barrackpore court by impersonating Ramen Das, a petty thief, lodged in the same lock-up. 

 Though Mondal surrendered after two days, six policemen were suspended on charges of dereliction of duty. 

 Kartick Das, who has been lodged in the jail since September 2004 in connection with a dacoity case, was to be produced in the SDJM?s court around 11 on Friday morning. 

 After the appearance in court, the accused was taken to the prison van, parked outside the court premises.

 Das struck up a conversation with the three policemen accompanying him, and requested one of them to take him to the toilet. One of the constables went along with Das, while another waited in the prison van. 

 The third, an assistant sub-inspector, went inside the court to collect some documents concerning the case.

 When the prisoner did not come out of the toilet even after half an hour, the policeman tried to force open the toilet door. The moment he did so, the accused suddenly jumped out of the toilet, pushed the constable aside and escaped within seconds. 

 Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas), has ordered an inquiry and a search is on to arrest the prisoner.

 Court records reveal that the accused, originally a resident of East Midnapore, was hiding in Barasat after committing some crimes in his village. At Barasat, Das committed a dacoity in September last year, and introduced himself as Kamal Sheikh when he was arrested. 

 Lawyers at Barasat court blamed policemen for the prisoner?s escape. ?Policemen should be more careful while handling hardcore criminals,? Kallol Dasgupta, a member of the Barasat Bar Association, said. 

 ?At least two cops should have accompanied the undertrial to the toilet. This is a case of sheer callousness on the part of policemen,? he added.

 ?We are unnecessarily blamed for the escape of undertrials from prison vans. It is the policemen?s responsibility to take care of them in the van,? observed additional inspector-general of prisons, Ramapada Bhattacharya.

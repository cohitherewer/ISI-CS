 An amusing satire with strong political overtones, Sundarams production Operation Bhomragarh clearly exposes the follies and fallacies of our callous, irresponsible ruling classes that bring ruin upon the lives of common people. It begins when Brindaban, a dangerous brigand, abducts Ahladi, the pet white elephant of King Bhramarchandra of Bhomragarh. When the bankrupt king fails to secure the ransom for Ahladi?s release, he seeks the help of his subjects, who refuse to offer any support to their unworthy king. Meanwhile, the Rajabahadur of Mayurhati sees in the situation an opportunity to fulfil his dream of vanquishing all the world?s terrorists and criminals. He reaches Bhomragarh with tanks, missiles, helicopters and other hi-tech weapons, only to bring more calamity to the people of the kingdom. Finally, a snake-charmer saves the day for Bhomragarh, his enchanted flute bringing an end to Brindaban and to the evil designs of the emperor of Mayurhati. Drama and direction: Manoj Mitra.

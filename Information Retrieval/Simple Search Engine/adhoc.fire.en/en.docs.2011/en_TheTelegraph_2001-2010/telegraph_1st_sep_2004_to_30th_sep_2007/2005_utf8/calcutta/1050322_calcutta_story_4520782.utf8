The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Another boost for flying boom

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The boom in the number of flights is ready for yet another boost, with additional flights to be launched this weekend by Indian Airlines and Singapore Airlines. And Calcutta is in focus.

 Singapore Airlines will kick off its fourth weekly Singapore-Calcutta-Singapore flight on March 28, with its arrival at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose international Airport at 10.20 pm. 

 In the past few months, the city has seen a ?fair rise? in the fliers on this route ? both business and leisure travellers ? in this sector, said officials. The airline currently flies on Tuesday, Friday and Saturday. The new schedule will have flights on Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. 

 ?Calcutta is an important city connecting to Southeast Asia. With the boom in Bengal, there is a surge in the number of fliers from the region,? said Bharath Mahadevan, manager, eastern India, Singapore Airlines.

 ?Our flights always go full and sometimes during the peak season, we have to turn back many customers, including some of our regular passengers, due to non-availability of seats. The new flight should help us in meeting the growing demand,? he added. 

 Indian Airlines on Monday announced new flights between Calcutta and Mumbai, Gaya and Yangon, Mumbai and Bangkok and Delhi and Kuala Lumpur via Bangkok in its summer schedule. 

 The airline has also increased the frequency of flights to Bangkok. The summer schedule comes into effect from Sunday, March 27.

 The new daily flight will leave Mumbai at 6.55 am and reach Calcutta at 9.25 am. The return flight will leave the city at 7.40 pm and reach Mumbai at 10.10 pm. 

 The new weekly flight will leave Gaya for Yangon at 11.45 am on Thursdays. The airline hopes to cater to Buddhist pilgrims from Southeast Asia.

 With the introduction of the daily flight between Mumbai and Bangkok and the increase in frequency of flights to Bangkok from Calcutta, Bangalore, Chennai and Hyderabad, the airline has almost doubled its seat capacity to and from the Thai capital.

 The tally is 56 flights per week from Bangkok to nine Indian cities.

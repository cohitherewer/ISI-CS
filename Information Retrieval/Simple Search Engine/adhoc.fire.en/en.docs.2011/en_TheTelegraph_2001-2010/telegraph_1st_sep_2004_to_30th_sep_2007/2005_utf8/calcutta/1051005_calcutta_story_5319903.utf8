 Infant in refuge, saviours turn pets 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Before work began for the local Durga puja, most residents of Babubagan wanted to get rid of the noisy street dogs. The civic dog squad was almost called in for the job.

 On Monday, however, in a matter of hours, Babubagan morphed into a colony of dog-lovers, as a bunch of strays became the apple of everybody?s eyes.

 The quartet of canines stood guard over an abandoned newborn near the main gate of Binodini High School, in Babubagan Lane, on Sunday night, until human attention was attracted.

 The baby boy is presumably from a well-to-do family. He was found wrapped in expensive, scented towels and a thick plastic sheet with a half-filled feeding bottle by his side. Local residents first took him to the Puja pandal.

 ?We were having an adda nearby. We saw the bundle but did not suspect anything until two of the dogs came up to us and started barking,? said Kuntal Roy, one of the baby?s rescuers.

 Later in the night, police handed over the baby to CINI-Asha, from where he was shifted to Sukanya, the state-run home for destitute children.

 ?According to our doctors, the boy is five to six days old and is in good health. We provided him with a fresh set of clothing, and fed and medicated him,? stated Swapna Sil, residential field officer of Amader Bari, a home for destitute children run by CINI-Asha.

 The newborn has been produced before the Juvenile Welfare Board and can now be adopted.

 On Tuesday, a few families contacted the Babubagan puja committee to express their interest in adopting the baby. 

 The saviours, too, received a steady stream of visitors, from Jodhpur Park, Selimpur and places further away. Quite a few of them fed the dogs biscuits, sweets and chocolates.

 ?Some of us were thinking of getting rid of the dogs, but what they have done has enhanced the prestige of the area. They will be treated like darlings from now,? said Suman Chatterjee, of the Babubagan puja committee.

 ?The way they guarded the abandoned baby is unbelievable. Overnight, we have all become dog-lovers,? he admitted with a smile.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Dial Delhi in call distress

 - Buddha asks Left MPs to help break BSNL deadlock

 OUR BUREAU

 In a bid to break the BSNL deadlock that has crippled Calcutta, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee appealed to Left Front MPs in Delhi to meet telecommunications minister Dayanidhi Maran.

 CPM leader Nilotpal Basu has already spoken to Maran, Bhattacharjee said at Writers? Buildings on Tuesday evening. A meeting is to be convened shortly to try and arrive at a solution to the crisis over promotion policies of executives at BSNL, he added.

 The Union telecommunications minister is expected to soon meet the striking officers and Left MPs from Bengal.

 On Monday, principal secretary to the chief minister A.K. Bhattacharya was in talks with S.P. Chakraborty, chief general manager of Calcutta Telephones. 

 Attention was drawn to the inconvenience caused by the phone-line jam to the Higher Secondary (HS) examinees, as also to the threat to the emergency services.

 ?Our agitation will go on, but keeping in mind the HS exams, we have decided to restore a backlog of technical faults. The linemen have all been directed to carry out telephone line repairs,? said Amit Gupta of the agitating body, the United Forum for BSNL Executives, on Tuesday.

 ?We are trying to get things back to normal,? added Dilip Saha, also affiliated to the protest platform. ?Connectivity in essential services has been restored and things are returning to normal.?

 BSNL officials have not held formal negotiations with representatives of the 50,000 executives across the country for implementation of the promotional policy. As talks between the agitating executives and the management reaches a stalemate, leaving employees ? and affected citizens ? in a state of uncertainty.

 Railway reservation systems continued to be hampered, as were basic telephone services. STD calls and Internet usage were hit hard, with cell phones, too, failing the consumer. 

 The blame was on the poor functioning of the BSNL hub that was resulting in the clogging of all calls leaving ? or rather attempting to leave ? the Calcutta circle on a full working day.

 Calcutta Police, meanwhile, was put on high alert, following news of trouble at BSNL offices in the districts. 

 In Asansol, a group of armed miscreants, allegedly led by the former Congress MLA Tapas Banerjee, went on the rampage at the office of A.K. Kundu, general manager, Asansol telecom circle.

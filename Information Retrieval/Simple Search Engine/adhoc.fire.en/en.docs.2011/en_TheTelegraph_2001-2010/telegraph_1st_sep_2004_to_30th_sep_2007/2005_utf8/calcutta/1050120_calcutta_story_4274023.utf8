 Sheer technical excellence

 SOUMITRA DAS

 One of Paritosh Sen?s works on display at the Academy of Fine Arts. Picture by Pradip Sanyal

 Paritosh Sen is a wonderful draughtsman. Nobody can doubt it. Look at the ease, facility and felicity with which he has executed those paintings and drawings being exhibited at the Academy of Fine Arts. From animals to human beings he fleshes them out with equal ease. 

 There is never a faulty or unsure stroke.

 He distorts the human body and facial features till they nearly turn into caricatures. But Sen?s sympathy for them is all too evident. 

 The old billy goat looks randy enough. The she goat has enormous dugs. The fish is almost tearful as it is about to be beheaded. Stray dogs snap at each other. The women musicians in the tradition of prints and paats are buxom and sensual. 

 The latent violence in our daily lives is embodied in the woman returning from the market holding a cock by its scrawny neck. In one still life, bloody fish heads are used instead of the traditional arrangement of fruits and flowers or of some other objects considered beautiful.

 There is a wonderful one of a fiery cockerel, its hackles raised, its eyes protruding from its sockets. There is another rather sad one of a Narmada Bachao activist, her eyes moist as she realises the futility of her rage.

 One cannot miss the touch of humour in his work. He is always laughing at himself, a quality that few of his Indian contemporaries possess. Many of them are gasbags, in fact. Here he is an old man with a younger woman coquettishly playing the guessing game with him. He has even portrayed himself as a simian.

 There are three of naked holymen, the kind always featured in photographs of Sagar Mela. They are corpulent and sport elf locks, ride motorbikes and grind bhang, and always figures of fun.

 The sexual innuendoes, too, are delightful. Couples make love, a woman enjoys her post-coital langour, while a third woman eats corn suggestively. The same way a woman holds a mango with a glint in her eye. It is amazing how this octogenarian artist pulls it off every time he does it.

 However, at times ones gets the sneaking feeling that notwithstanding his undoubted technical excellence, there is a certain lack of variety in this current body of works, and of execution coming too easily. This one never felt at his earlier retrospective organised when Sen turned 80.

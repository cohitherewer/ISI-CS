 What: The Sinful Sisters night.

 Where: Tantra.

 When: Saturday night.

 The sibling act: This was the sister of all events, with the awesome twosome of Mumait and Zabayn Khan coming together for a scintillating performance that mirrored their screen acts.

 They have, of course, done an item number together in the recent Fardeen-Koena starrer Ek Khiladi Ek Haseena. People have given me lot of love and adulation. My sister has it in her to make it to the level I have reached, said the Dekh le girl, Mumait.

 The sister, in fact, proved to be a shade hotter when it came to provocative moves and seductive steps.

 The show: Comprised four sequences, with the sexy sisters dancing to latest Bollywood tracks. To start with, Mumait sizzled to Ishq hai jhootha and Ankhiyan na maar. Zabayn then ruled the bar top with No entry. The third and fourth sequences saw the sisters gyrating to Deedar de, Dekh le and Mere piya gaye Rangoon. Zabayn wrapped up the evening, rather the morning, with her Kajra re act.

 Last word: Hot!

Beer blast

 What: Fosters Australian Beer and Barbecue Lunch hosted by Nondon Bagchi.

 Where: The Poolside at The Park.

 When: Over lunch on Sunday. Started at 12 noon and continued till late afternoon.

 Hostspeak: There could not have been a better time for a party. Nothing beats catching up with friends on a relaxed Sunday afternoon and having a good adda session, said Nondon.

 Also spotted: Members of prominent city bands like Cassinis Division, Krosswindz, Hip Pocket, Orient Express...

 Sip and bite: The lunch spread comprised Russian Salad, Caesar Salad, Cottage-Cheese Sashlik, Roasted Lamb, Chicken Burgers, Grilled Fish, Fried Sausages, Apple Pie with ice-cream and Chocolate Mousse.

 There was, of course, lots of chilled beer and a host of mocktails to go with the grub.

 Last word: Chilled out.

 Design do

 What: First anniversary celebrations at Sana, a boutique housing designer Chhutis label.

 Where: The studio at 7B, Palm Avenue.

 When: Monday, noon.

 The show: Chhutis fall-winter collection had kaftan, poncho, jacket, sari and salwar kameez in vibrant splashes. The clothes were displayed by models Sudipta, Amrita and Ishika.

 Designerspeak: The boutique has completed its first year successfully with support from my loyal clients. I hope to receive the same in the coming years, smiled Chhuti.

 Last word: Holiday mood.

 Barge bash

 What: Aquablast.

 Where: The party took place on three barges on the Ganges. Adonis, Sumangal and RPL sailed from Millennium Park with 450 people on board.

 When: On Saturday night, the barges took the regular party crowd to the middle of the river and were stationed there till 2.30 am on Sunday.

 Hostspeak: Cruise parties are a common thing in Mumbai, but the concept is relatively new in Calcutta. There are people who are bored with the regular night club hopping. A barge party is a welcome change for that segment. We would be hosting these parties from time to time to create a totally different ambience and party crowd, said Samrat Roy Chowdhury, owner of SRC Waterworks and the barges.

 The bash: The barges were all decked up with shine and shimmer as DJ Harish and DJ Suraj took control of the console. When the barges started moving, guest DJ Tushqa started churning out hits like Kajra re, Ho jata hai kaise pyar, Just chill and Tere nazar hai mujhpe. The event was managed by Blink of an Eye.

 The crowd: It was a welcome change for 450-odd party hoppers. At this time of the year, one likes to be out in the open. The night club atmosphere gets to you at times. Moreover, being on the river at 1 am in the morning gives you a totally different kick, said Kunal Sinha, a party hopper.

 Last word: Floating is fun.

 Harvest high

 What: Chantilli Harvest Festival.

 Where: Royal Calcutta Turf Club.

 When: Saturday evening.

 The idea: The festival was one amongst various initiatives taken by the racecourse to attract the family crowd to the races. Racing is a serious affair and that keeps the fun loving crowd away. We want to send out a message that a whole lot of activities can take place on the sprawling premises, apart from racing, says a spokesperson for RCTC.

 The bash: The races were followed by a colourful fashion show at 5 pm. After that it was time for the Great Grape Stomp. We have arranged for 200 kg of grapes. At the height of the party anybody is welcome to hop into the big bucket and start crushing the grapes. This is the first time grape crushing is happening in Calcutta, said a spokesperson for Champagne Indage Limited. The fact that the party people were flying high was reflected in the figures: more than 150 cases of wine were downed!

 Last word: Hic!

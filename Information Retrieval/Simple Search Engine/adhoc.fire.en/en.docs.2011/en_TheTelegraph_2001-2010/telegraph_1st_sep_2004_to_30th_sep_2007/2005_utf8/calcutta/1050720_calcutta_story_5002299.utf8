The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 We Ask You Answer

 Ban no curb on dupe bane

 Each week, Metro asks its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses is published every Wednesday. Today?s question: Should astrology programmes on television be banned? More letters will be published next week 

 Sutanwi LAhiri,

 Ballygunge

Astrology, unlike astronomy, doesn?t have a scientific 

basis. Astrologers are glib cheats who make a living by exploiting the gullibility 

of people. Those who are not confident enough of triumphing over life?s difficulties 

approach fortune-tellers for consolation. It is unethical on the part of television 

channels to beam such programmes to make their TRPs climb. In doing so, they help 

in the spread of superstition and endorse malpractice. 

 Tuhin purkayastha, 

 Parnashree Palli

The experts who come on the astrology shows do not 

answer all the questions posed by the callers. Instead, the callers are pressured 

by the astrologers to visit their chambers. Those who have blind faith in these 

fortune-tellers fall into their traps and spend a lot of money.

gunjeet wadhwa, 

 Rai Bahadur Road

Astrology programmes on television should not be banned. 

The viewers have the freedom not to tune into the channels that air such programmes 

or follow the dictates of the astrologers.

 SourIsh Misra, 

 Salt Lake

No, astrology programmes should not be banned on television. 

Astrology has helped in the betterment of human life. Its practice has been going 

on in our country for a long time. Like in other professions, dishonest people 

have entered the field of astrology, too. But we should not forget that there 

are many good astrologers as well. They help people deal with their problems and 

show them the right direction. Any educated person should be able to differentiate 

between honest astrologers and the frauds.

 Prasanta kumar Ghosh, 

 Barasat

Astrology programmes on television should be banned. 

Astrologers bank on the faith of the people to dupe them by selling talismans, 

rings and stones. It is impossible to predict the future, yet astrology continues 

to thrive in this jet age.

 Dalim kumar datta,

 APC Road 

Astrology is the art of determining the influence 

of stars on human affairs. It is a good way of gauging the future. However, most 

astrologers are not learned enough to predict the future. They do not acquire 

enough knowledge of the subject and mislead young men and women. They also prey 

on weak-minded people to sell expensive stones. In order to stop unfair business 

practices by astrologers, their television programmes should be monitored or banned.

 d.p. bhattacharya,

 Sonarpur

Astrology is dependent on faith and a large part of 

the population believes in it. Like in other businesses, those engaged in the 

practice of astrology try to boost their income by attending television programmes. 

If astrology programmes on television are banned, astrologers would lose their 

livelihood, perhaps creating an unemployment problem.

 arunava bose chowdhury,

 Barrackpore

Not caring to know if astrology is based on science 

or not, a section of over-emotional, fatalistic and negative-minded people approach 

television astrologers for instant remedy to their problems and to know what lies 

in store for them in the future. The astrologers, finding a ready clientele of 

gullible people, cheat them. The channels that air astrology programmes have forgotten 

their educative roles and are equally responsible for misleading people. It would 

be best if such programmes are banned before the situation goes out of hand.

 Diptimoy ghosh,

 Salt Lake

It will not be fair to ban astrology programmes on 

television as that might hurt the sentiments of those who watch them. Though there 

is no logic or scientific basis to astrology, several so-called intellectuals 

take part in the discussions on the astrology channels. I feel banning vulgar 

and obscene programmes on television is as important as banning astrology programmes.

 Sujit de,

 Sodepur 

To save viewers from being cheated, astrology programmes 

should be banned on television. Astrology has no scientific basis. It holds the 

sun and moon as planets and there is no mention of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. 

According to astrology, everything is predestined as per the position of planets 

at the time of one?s birth. Yet astrologers prescribe gems and stones to change 

the fate of human beings. There is a sharp contradiction in the subject itself. 

It is necessary not to allow astrologers to benefit from the use of mass media.

 Arpita chowdhury, 

 East Sinthi Road

It is painful to see that in this age of technological 

advancement, astrology programmes are being telecast regularly on private television 

channels. Television is the medium of spreading literacy and entertaining viewers. 

No channel has the right to make viewers superstitious. The nonsensical programmes 

only offer opportunities to astrologers to take advantage of people?s weaknesses. 

Therefore, the programmes should be banned.

 ajit kumar das,

 Ghunsuri, Howrah

Astrology programmes on television should be banned 

immediately as the astrologers extract money from people by giving them rings, 

stones that do not work. Indulging in such activities is certainly a crime. The 

programmes should be banned and the astrologers punished by introducing laws, 

if necessary. 

 susanta Kumar bedajna,

 KB Sarani

Why shouldn?t astrology programmes on television be 

banned? Not only is astrology unscientific, but is anti-knowledge. Nowadays almost 

everybody is in some sort of crisis. In a bid to tide over problems, people ignore 

logic and allow themselves to be fooled by astrologers. If a prediction comes 

true to some extent by sheer coincidence, a client becomes more dependent on his 

astrologer. Those who want the help of astrologers can visit them at their offices. 

Public broadcast of astrology programmes cannot be allowed. 

 B.N. Bose,

 Dum Dum

Generally women approach astrologers and they do so 

when they are at their most vulnerable. However, most astrologers lack proper 

knowledge of their subject and try to cheat their clients. Astrology programmes 

should be banned on television as they are ruining our society. Astrology has 

become the easiest way to earn quick bucks.

 Sachindra nath mitra,

 Rakhal Ghosh Lane

Astrology has no scientific basis. To protect innocent 

people from being duped by astrologers, programmes by them should be banned on 

television. 

 Ronita dutta,

 Jadavpur

Most people approach astrologers lured by the curiosity 

about the future. They look up to astrologers for solutions to their personal 

problems and dilemmas, and end up being exploited. People should look at themselves 

critically instead of making astrologers the scapegoat. 

 K. mitra,

 Paddapukur Road

Astrology programmes should not be banned. For several 

channels, these programmes are the sole source of revenue. Stopping the programmes 

would put a lot of youths out of work. Those who believe in astrology, will find 

other ways of seeking help from astrologers. It is best to let people decide if 

an astrologer is honest or is merely interested in money. If people stop being 

interested in astrology, the programmes will automatically stop.

 Naren sen,

 Santragachhi

Some people have such blind faith in astrology that 

they wear rings set with expensive stones merely because their astrologers have 

asked them to. In my opinion, astrology programmes on television should immediately 

be banned. Union information and broadcasting minister Jaipal Reddy should take 

the initiative and discuss with ministers of culture of the states how to prevent 

such programmes from being aired on television. Such programmes make a fool of 

not only the common people, but also educated ones.

Govinda bakshi,

 Budge Budge

When programmes that smack of immorality are not banned, 

why should astrology programmes be discriminated against? Astrology is concerned 

with the effects of planetary movements on human lives. Subtle calculations by 

astrologers can help reveal the future. The study of the subject should not be 

discouraged.

 Chandan ray,

 Sakuntala Park

Astrology utilises the knowledge of geography and 

mathematics to foretell the future. It is human to want to know what lies in store, 

and hence is not a sin to watch astrology programmes on television. The authorities 

of television channels should allow only astrologers of repute to come on air 

so that the viewers are not taken advantage of.

 B.k. chowdhary,

 Kankinara

Astrology is an important part of life. Eight out 

of 10 people believe in astrology as it tells them whether the positions of the 

stars are favourable or unfavourable. The stars can cause miseries in the lives 

of people, and astrologers can prevent that. Astrology programmes are the need 

of the hour.

 Sunil Banerjee,

 VIP Road

Astrology programmes on television should immediately 

be banned. They have no merit and do not deserve to be aired. Astrologers who 

appear on these programmes are cheats, and take advantage of the mental weakness 

of people.

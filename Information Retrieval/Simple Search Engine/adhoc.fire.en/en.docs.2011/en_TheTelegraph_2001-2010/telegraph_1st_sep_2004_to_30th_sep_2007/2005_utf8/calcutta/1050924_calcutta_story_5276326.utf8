The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 I have seen some of the home guards in the city performing their duties on vital roads very efficiently. In fact, they are talented enough to be promoted to match traffic police officers. Only if the deserving home guards are encouraged in some way, monetarily or otherwise, will they find the motivation to continue to work diligently. They will also be examples for others to follow. The city?s deteriorating road traffic needs these hard-working and sincere men in uniform. 

 B.N. Bose,

 Baranagar police station on BT Road was renovated some time ago. However, mounds of muck and discarded vehicles dot the area in front of the station. Can the officer-in-charge attract the attention of the higher authorities to the problem?

 Calcutta State Transport Corporation?s new BS II-compliant buses are very comfortable. But just a few months on the road and many of them are already looking run-down. This reveals the lack of regular maintenance. Minor accidents have also damaged the bus bodies. What?s the use of spending lakhs on new buses if they don?t even last half of their expected life span? And the public phones installed in some of the buses is a complete waste. It is the long-distance buses that need the service. 

 Biswajoti Bagchi,

 Alipore.

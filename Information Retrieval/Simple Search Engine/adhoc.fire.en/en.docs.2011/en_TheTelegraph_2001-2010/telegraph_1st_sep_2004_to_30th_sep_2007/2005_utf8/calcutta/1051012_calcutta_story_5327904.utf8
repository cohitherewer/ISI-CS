 Private broom for civic garbage

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 An annual spending of Rs 43 crore and free housing and electricity for an army of 12,000-odd sweepers. Yet, cleanliness is not something the city can show off.

 But the streets, the lanes and the bylanes are now set to look spruce, as the civic authorities have worked out a plan to outsource the cleaning job.

 ?We think we will do much better if private agencies are assigned the task,? mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya said on Friday. ?The agencies can supplement the efforts of our conservancy staff.?

 Defending the move, a conservancy department official said 700 private workers and an annual expenditure of Rs 6 crore can match the output of 12,000-strong civic employees, on whom the authorities spend as much Rs 43 crore.

 Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said: ?A practical and do-able cleanliness programme will roll out in three months.?

 The mayor has met municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya, who has assured him of all help from the government.

 Under the new scheme, the city will be divided into sectors, each of which will be under the charge of a private agency. As part of the scheme, the entire solid waste management will be re-oriented and redistributed with enough logistic support to make round-the-clock cleanliness a sustainable proposition. 

 As a first step, commissioner Bandyopadhyay has initiated a move to bring all garbage vats under an electronic scanner. 

 Just by looking at the display boards in their rooms, the mayor or the commissioner will be able to know which parts of city have not been cleaned at a particular time.

 To fine-tune the scheme, Bandyopadhyay has held several rounds of talks with mayoral council member (conservancy) Chandana Ghosh Dastidar and chief engineer (conservancy) Arun Sarkar.

 The mayor has ruled out retrenchment of sweepers once outsourcing is formalised. Around 60 per cent of the sweepers will retire by 2010. The civic authorities have decided not to fill up the vacant posts.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 60-second ATM lapse equals Rs 4 lakh

 - Youth arrested in Kalakar St for ingenious fraud by mastering swipe card technology

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Alok Sonkar, 22, from Posta, was arrested on Wednesday on charges of defrauding an automated teller machine (ATM). He was trying to withdraw money from the account of another user seconds after the man had left, cashing in on his carelessness. This took place on Kalakar Street and the ATM was that of a private bank. 

 ?The manner in which Alok used to operate is simply amazing. He pulled it off so intelligently that it beats the technology hands down,? said Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (central) on Thursday.

 Alok knew that in the swipe card system of activating an account for transactions ? the system in place at a private bank?s ATM counter where the fraud took place ? an ATM account remains active for 60 seconds after all transactions are over, unless the user presses the exit button.

 So, Aloke took advantage of this and used to transact within these few seconds. Over the past four months, while Alok failed on most occasions, the few times he succeeded fetched him a whopping sum of about Rs 4 lakh.

 ?He had got a card for himself from the same branch, so that no one would suspect him. Whenever the chance came, he never lost it. He bought two cars for himself and we hope to get other details from him soon,? said a senior officer of Posta police station. 

 Officers of the bank said it had two types of ATMs ? card insertion and card swipe ? and admitted that the swipe card system could be the root of the problem. 

 But Sonkar could not be the only one. Rattled by complaints of ATM frauds, police are on the lookout for others on the prowl across the city?s central business district, including Burrabazar, Hare Street and Bowbazar. 

 Police issued a string of directives aimed at countering such fraud. ?ATM users should keep a strict watch on all those waiting in the queue while withdrawing money. A description of the persons around would be extremely helpful to the police,? said detective chief Gyanwant Singh. ?One should be particularly attentive while carrying out the transactions and ensure that the exit button has been pressed.?

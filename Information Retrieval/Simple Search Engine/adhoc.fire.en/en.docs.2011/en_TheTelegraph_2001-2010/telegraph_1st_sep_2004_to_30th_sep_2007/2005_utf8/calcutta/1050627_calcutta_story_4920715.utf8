The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 ?I don?t want to just look good?

 ?I never intended 

 to do Boom,? admits Katrina. (Above) With Abhishek 

 Bachchan in Ram Gopal Varma?s Sarkar, she 

 also has Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya ready for release 

 Out of nowhere, you have two 

 releases ? Sarkar and Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya ? 

 lined up in two weeks. Did you plan it that way?

 No, it was not planned at all. In fact, I am quite disappointed that the two films are coming back to back. I would have ideally liked to have spaced out the two. Sarkar was supposed to come much later. Anyway, it wasn?t really in my hands and there is really no point in planning in this industry.

 These two films really pitch 

 you with the best in the industry. Was Kaizad Gustad?s Boom 

 a bad debut, in hindsight?

 I have had to answer this question so many times. People don?t understand Boom was never a film I intended to do. It just happened. From there on, all the films that I have signed or I am going to sign are by choice. I would like people to judge me on my own choices and not on something I had to do without my wish.

 So are your characters in these 

 two films, you have chosen, different from each other?

 Yes, they are completely different from each other. In Sarkar, I make more of a guest appearance. It is a film full of characters, who come and go throughout the film. I did the film because I have known Ramuji quite well for some time now. You can call Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya the first and only film where I get to do a full-fledged role.

 What was it like working with 

 David Dhawan and his brand of crazy comedy?

 It was great. He has lots of energy which keeps everyone in the right spirits and good mood. His jokes keep all of us going and it is also very helpful since it keeps you in your character all the time.

 Do you think your off-screen 

 romance with Salman Khan will help your on-screen chemistry 

 in Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya?

 I don?t think the two things are related. It?s mainly people?s assumptions. I have never commented on this and I am not going to. Every one of us has worked really hard on the film. I just hope people go and like us in the movie.

 There is a lot of talk of your 

 lines being dubbed by someone else for the films?

 Let me clarify that both Sarkar and Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya have my own voice. I am all for constructive criticism but when people continuously harp on things that do not exist, I don?t like it at all. When you read or hear things like this, it puts you in a bad mood for the rest of the day. I really don?t understand why journalists just want to bring people down and then keep harping on that.

 You have almost given up ramp 

 modelling?

 Not just now, for the last one-and-a-half years I have not done much ramp modelling at all. I have been too busy with films to walk the ramp. I am constantly shooting for some film or the other.

 What are your forthcoming films?

 I am doing Raj Kanwar?s next film where I am paired with Akshay Kumar. He presents women in a very beautiful way. And I hope he does the same with me.

 Given the Western image you 

 have, what kind of roles do you want do in the future?

 Eventually I would like to do a very serious kind of a film. I want to do films where I do not just look good. But they will come in due time. I am just in my first year in Bollywood.

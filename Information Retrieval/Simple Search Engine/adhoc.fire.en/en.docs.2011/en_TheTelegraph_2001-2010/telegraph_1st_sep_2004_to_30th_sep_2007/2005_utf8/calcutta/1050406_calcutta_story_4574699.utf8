 Poila Baisakh remains closer to the heart than New Year?s Day to Bengalis. The average family would definitely buy new clothes on the occasion. While men may pick up any article, a sari for the wife or the sister is a must. It may not be a costly one, as costly purchases are held back for the Pujas. But when it comes to volume of sales, Poila Baisakh is next only to Durga puja, the marriage season excepted. Most Bengali businessmen, like myself, offer pujas at Kalighat temple with the new account book. Another ritual is held, back at the shop, dedicated to Lord Ganesha. On the day, families eat together; pronam and ashirbad are in order. New Year?s Day is more of an excuse to make merry in the comfort of winter. Parties are organised in hotels and TV channels hype the occasion. If Poila Baisakh is taken outdoors and marketed as well, it will also seem to be as grand an occasion.

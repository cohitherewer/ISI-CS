 With four weeks to go, one of the city?s mega pujas is embroiled in a controversy. The point of contention is whether the current organisers of Jodhpur Park Sarbojanin Durgotsab have the right to the land that the puja has been held on since 1960.

 The feuding factions are two resident bodies ? The Bengal Secretariat Co-operative Land Mortgage Bank amp; Housing Society Limited and the Jodhpur Institute. The Society has slapped a case in Alipore court under CrPC 144 (2) after the institute did not stop construction of the pandal on the site, despite a notice to ?vacate possession of our premises?.

 ?The Society, registered in 1945, was the owner of all land in Jodhpur Park,? says spokesperson Aloke Kumar. ?Since the early 1950s, the Society has been organising the Durga puja. A subsidiary body called Jodhpur Park Institute was formed in 1967 to organise cultural activities on behalf of the Society. The institute would form a sub-committee for the Puja. In 2003, we came to know that the institute had registered the sub-committee as a separate body, though a case was underway.?

 Society members say they pay the tax for the premises and have not given permission to the puja committee for either the Puja or for marriage receptions. ?We are preparing to perform our own Puja on the spot,? says Krishna Roy of the Society.

 The Jodhpur Park Sarodiya Utsav Committee, though, is standing its ground. ?We have a decree on a title suit filed in 1995 in Alipore court that gives us the right to let out part of the premises and the right of construction to keep our activities going. They are trying to get the decree vacated but the matter is sub-judice,? claims Bijoy Parekh.

 Puja committee general secretary Sumanta Roy explains that registration of the committee was necessary to allow all residents to be eligible for membership. Under institute bylaws, only family members of landowners who had signed up with the Society could become institute members.

 The puja theme this time is an old temple courtyard. ?Our decorator is being told to stop work with a warning that the Puja would not take place. This is unacceptable,? Roy says.

 As Society members spread the word about ?unlawful activities? of the institute, the 53rd edition of the Jodhpur Park Sarbojanin Durgotsab ? that last year won the Best Puja prize from Anandabazar Patrika Sharad Arghya ? is in jeopardy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The true lady, seen and heard

 A rendezvous with REKHA, off the sets of Yatra, where she spoke at length but revealed little

 Tall willowy frame, smooth ivory skin, black hair cascading down a slender shoulder. How has age failed to defeat this woman in her fourth decade on screen? One wonders, as Rekha breezes into a room waiting in anxious anticipation.

 After daylong persuasion by director Goutam Ghose and producer Bipin Vohra, the reluctant Rekha has finally granted a five-minute photo shoot. ?But no questions please,? is the brief for reporters, because She doesn?t give interviews while shooting.

 For the better part of November, the enigmatic actress has been ensconced in Hyderabad for Ghose?s Hindi feature film Yatra, backed by Vohra?s SPS Arts and Entertainment.

 Dressed in all-black trousers and top, a jacket knotted around her slim waist, with secretary Farzana in tow, Rekha pulls up a chair beside co-star Nana Patekar.

 Welcome to the Rekha rendezvous at Ramoji Rao Film City. Up first, a curious courtesy call from the elusive one: ?Have we met before??

 ?A true lady is supposed to be seen and not heard. And I am a true lady,? she laughs. But saviour Nana comes to the rescue of the reporters. ?They want to ask you some questions, poochho, poochho??

 Rekha relents. So, why did she say yes to her role in Yatra? ?I don?t like to talk about my role while shooting the film, because my interpretation of the role is not the same as the director?s. It?s the director?s dream, plus with what my co-stars put into it, the film is out of my control. I don?t work in very many films and I want my performance to speak,? says Lajwanti of Yatra, the courtesan whom novelist Nana writes about in his award-winning book.

 If Lajwanti is defined by the director as ?half-fact, half-fiction?, the woman in black, alluring eyes concealed behind dark glasses, seems no less enigmatic.

 She may be the Inaccessible One, but ask her why she?s doing the film and she starts off: ?The film is a medium through which I get to know people better. From the light boy to the art director, I can connect with my fellow human beings??

 Then, she drifts closer to the point. ?But this film (Yatra) is special. I have not experienced something like this in a long time. The day-to-day feelings have been put in such an interesting way. And kudos to Goutamda and Nana for putting the film across to me? This is a bad angle,? she interrupts, censuring a photographer.

 Alert, articulate and adept at dodging questions, with a smile. Does she know Bengali (she has, after all, worked with several Bengali directors, from Hrishikesh Mukherjee to Goutam Ghose)? ?Ektu ektu jani,? comes the reply with an accent. Somebody from the crew insists she knows more. ?Na, shotyi bolchhi. The only thing I learnt this time is Amake khub ghum pachhe,? she giggles like a girl.

 The poise is back the next moment. What does she want to do apart from films? ?Oh, there are so many things I want to do and I know that there?s little time left,? she pauses to smile, before adding: ?Every day is very special? I don?t know what the medium would be. Maybe I will write a book or do something else. I am aware of the effect I have on people, even in a fleeting glimpse? But I don?t like to think things, I like to do things.?

 A pause again and then an afterthought. ?But I am not done with as an actor yet. Have I, Nana?? she turns to her co-star for assurance.

 With that little gesture of self-doubt, it seems a layer of mystery has peeled off at last. No such luck.

 Does she have a dream role? ?I don?t believe in anything dreamy. I stopped dreaming when I was seven. That was when I realised that my life was too perfect. I am a realist. Reality is better than fantasy,? she smiles.

 The five minutes have stretched to 15 and there?s a flight to catch, Rekha is reminded. She excuses herself, says ?bye? and vanishes.

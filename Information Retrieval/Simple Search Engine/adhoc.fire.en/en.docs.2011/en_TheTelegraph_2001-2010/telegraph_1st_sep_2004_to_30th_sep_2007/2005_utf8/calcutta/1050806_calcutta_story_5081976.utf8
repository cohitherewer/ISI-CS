 Steadfastly Sartre 

 Theatrecian?s production of Jean-Paul Sartre?s No Exit

 You win some, you lose some. As in life, so in art. The directorial promise displayed on debut by Tathagata Singha in Theatrecian?s production of Waiting for Godot faded on an equally challenging play, Sartre?s No Exit. But that should not give him cause for heartburn. 

 The index of success in theatre is no simple matter ? the very process of attempting a complex classic imparts lessons that qualify the experience as successful in its own way. And surely Theatrecian has an unusual feat to its credit: I cannot think of any other local group that has staged two Sartre plays within the space of a few months. Is Theatrecian specialising in existential philosophy? 

 Another factor partly accounts for Singha?s reversal in fortune. Beckett is theatrically savvier than and superior to Sartre. He consistently amuses, whereas Sartre steadfastly refuses to entertain; he invented a new dramaturgy, whereas Sartre followed the conventional structure. Thus it becomes far more difficult to enliven Sartre today. Even in No Exit, his dramatic masterpiece, a director has to create exciting theatrical opportunities that the otherwise talky script apparently lacks, but inherently implies. 

 As a conversation among three characters condemned after death to a perpetual purgatorio ? ironically pictured as a polite living room ? with no hope of salvation offered to them, No Exit demands deep acting resources from its cast. But only Ronjini Chakravarty as Estelle, the woman at the centre yet the last to enter, met these expectations. She expressed vividly the sophistication and self-consciousness associated with a French coquette, flirting with the lone man Garcin. 

 Tanaji Dasgupta, however, behaved too dark and gloomy as Garcin, while Bornila Chatterjee never credibly conveyed to us Inez?s lesbian inclinations. Both needed to demonstrate greater desire to take control over the others, attack each other, and try to seduce Estelle more actively. 

 Consequently, it became impossible for Chakravarty to carry the menage a trois on her own, without adequate support from her two bookends on either side dragging the dialogue down. It takes more than one person to make interpersonal relations ? even antagonistic ones ? happen on stage. 

 The key to the play, often misunderstood by those who just see its surface, is that it is not about hell, but about causal responsibility for one?s actions. Sartre once wrote: ?Man is only what he does. Man becomes what he chooses to be.? These thoughts made a lot of sense during the cataclysmic loss of faith in World War II, when No Exit premiered in occupied Paris in May 1944, a month before the Allies landed on the beaches of Normandy.

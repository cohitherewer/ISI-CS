 Security shield for Eden match

 Making it past the security personnel to the gallery might just prove a tad more difficult than getting tickets to the India-South Africa ODI at Eden Gardens on November 26.

 Unprecedented protective measures are in the offing for the day-night match. The serial bomb blasts and subsequent red alert in New Delhi, and an enhanced threat perception has made the Calcutta cops jittery. They are reluctant to leave any security loophole unplugged at Eden.

 Officers of Calcutta Police and public works department (PWD) officials visited the stadium on Tuesday to review the safety scenario. A plan will be chalked out to prevent any untoward incident before and during the match.

 A three-tier security ring will be in place, extending from the dressing rooms of the teams to the roads leading to the stadium. 

 Vulnerable points, including parking lots around the 100,000-seater arena, will be under special vigil.

 The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) and police authorities expect a full house in view of the recent performances of the resurgent Indian side.

 Uniformed policemen and plainclothes cops from the detective department and the special branch will be deployed in and around the stadium on match day. 

 Rapid Action Force personnel and bomb disposal squads will support them. At least 16,000 security men and women are expected to be on match duty.

 All the spectators will have to pass through metal detectors and will be frisked before they are allowed to enter the ground. Closed-circuit televisions have been installed at vantage points to monitor the crowd movement. 

 Food packets, water bottles and mobile phones will not be allowed inside. 

 The Calcutta Police team that surveyed the stadium on Tuesday was led by deputy commissioner (headquarters) Anuj Sharma. He said: ?The security arrangements for the India-South Africa one-day international are still being worked out. We are keeping in mind that a large number of spectators are expected and that there is an enhanced threat perception. The PWD officials accompanied us during the survey. They pointed out areas where renovation is necessary.? 

 Armed security personnel will spread out on the gallery and stand on guard along the boundary line, a ploy that worked well during the football World Cup in France in 1998. 

 To ensure easy movement for the policemen, the CAB has decided to restrict the number of spectators in certain blocks. 

 Dog squads and bomb disposal squads will do the rounds inside and outside the stadium, including the parking lots, while the match is on.

 ?Security is always an issue in big international matches, when the stadium is packed to capacity. This time, we are being especially careful due to the explosions in Delhi. There is also the question of crowd control,? explained a senior officer of Calcutta Police.

 The history of crowd unrest at Eden Gardens has not made the job of the cops easier. 

 A Test match against Pakistan in February 1999 had to be completed before an empty gallery, after police drove out the spectators following crowd violence. 

 The 1996 World Cup semi-final between India and Sri Lanka was abandoned after angry fans pelted stones and bottles at the players following a batting collapse of the home team.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Sketching sights and sounds 

 Tut Tut. Pouet Pouet. In case this sounds Greek to you, think in French. For it is the honking of horns and rickshaws as heard by three cartoonists from the land of the creators of Asterix.

 ?When we stepped out of the airport, we were hit by this maddening sound. In France, when you blow the horn, it is a sign of aggressiveness. Here, it is a mode of communication,? exclaims Tignous, the youngest of the trio working with Charlie Hebdo, a satirical magazine.

 So when they sat down to decide on the title of the journal they were creating for the Book Fair, the choice was unanimous.

 To celebrate the creativity of France, the theme country this year, four journals are being brought out, full of cartoons. These are being distributed among visitors to the France pavilion. Says Nicolas Blasquez, director of Alliance Francaise de Calcutta, whose idea this was: ?When I was posted in Kenya seven years ago, I had flown over the three ? Bridenne, Jean-Yves Hamel (who calls himself JY) and Tignous ? for a similar project for the Francophonie Week. There the journal was called Bata Huru (Free Duck) in Swahili.?

 In Calcutta, they have been joined by Delhi-based cartoonist Vishwajyoti Ghosh. ?I wanted him in the team as the project is steeped in the spirit of co-operation,? explains Blasquez.

 In the first few days of the fair, the four could be spotted at various corners on the mela ground, busy sketching away. Then till late at night, they would camp at the Alliance office and put finishing touches to the cartoons that would be rushed to the press the morning after. ?I love the crowd here. There is nothing like this in France,? says Tignous, staring at the multitude.

 But it is not just the fair that has found space in the issues. Ganesha is a prominent presence, dancing with a goddess or sitting at the fair. ?I love him with his trunk,? says Bridenne, simulating an elephantine nose. To get to know Ganesha and the other gods better, they went to Kumartuli. ?The place reminded me of the Ecole des Beaux Arts,? he smiles. 

 Marching soldiers and steaming coffee are present in the journals as well, a result of their journey to the Republic Day parade and the College Street Coffee House. ?The only bad moment here has been when I chewed chopped chilli, thinking it was green pea at a south Calcutta restaurant,? grimaces JY, of Le Monde.

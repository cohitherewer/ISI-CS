 Theres much more to designer wear than clothes and jewellery. Ask young designer Namrata Kanoi, who has made footwear and bags her forte. Retailing from her residence in Satyam Towers, 3, Alipore Road, Namrata has been specialising in various kinds of accessories for the past two years. But its shoes and bags that are closest to her heart.

 The designer is hosting an exhibition of her new collection at her residence on August 8, 9 and 10.

 The footwear range consists of slippers and formal shoes of various shapes. There are unusual and funky footwear such as puzzle-shaped, watermelon-shaped, letter eight-shaped and so on. Each piece is unique and there are no repetitions of the same pattern, says Namrata. 

 The fabrics used include raw silk, brocade, jute, mat and denim. These are embellished with buttons, gemstones, shells, corals, antique sequins and coins.

 The bags are mostly co-ordinated with the footwear. Raw silk, woven silk, brocade and wool in vibrant hues make up the bags. 

 The main attraction of my bags are the handles that I try and innovate drawing inspiration from the seasons, she adds.

 A range of totes using antique jewellery as embellishments catches the eye in Namratas collection. Casual bags targeted at teenagers are made from denim and embellished with patchwork, sequins and prints. 

 The formal ones are more structured and are perfect for evenings out.

 Apart from bags and shoes, for the exhibition I have also done some jewellery and special gift items for Rakhi, she reveals.

 Tress tales

 Transcend, the LOreal collaboration unisex salon at Tollygunge Club, celebrated its second anniversary on August 3. As part of the birthday revelry, the latest line of hair colour from LOreal was showcased at the studio with city models sporting the reds, browns and blondes on their crowns.

 A variety of cuts, styling and colours were demonstrated on models Cheena, Joyeeta, Shreya, Monty, Bharat and Ronita who did an impromptu catwalk inside the parlour.

 The cuts and colours are tailor-made to add that spark to your look. They are easily manageable, too, explains Reeta Mohan Toshniwal of Transcend. 

 Light blonde on the inside layers peppered with ash brown on the crown is a new combination added to the range of hair hues. Alternating strands of light and dark blonde promise to make heads turn. 

 A dash of magenta red combined with dark blonde and iridescent mahogany is recommended by Reeta for women with fair skin tones. Another hit combo is that of light brown mahogany streaked with light blonde gold. For the metrosexual male, Reeta suggests the cool iceberg highlights on the spiked crown blended with natural brown. 

 For the more adventurous, there are electric combinations of blonde with a greenish tinge and brown with dashes of violet to choose from.

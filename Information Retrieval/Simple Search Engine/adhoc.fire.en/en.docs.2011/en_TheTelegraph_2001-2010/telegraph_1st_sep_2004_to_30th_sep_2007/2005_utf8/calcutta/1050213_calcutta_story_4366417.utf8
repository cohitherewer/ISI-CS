The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A tale of two realities

 There is no escaping the fact that 

 the product is what you sell, while the brand is what she 

 buys

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 Cookme 

 is a major player in the branded ground spice market. For 

 years, they had a pack design that their users had got accustomed 

 to. Even then a need must have been felt to give the brand 

 a facelift. A new design has come on their packaging. Aesthetically, 

 most would agree that the new-look Cookme appeals more.

 Yet, a campaign has been launched. 

 No, not to draw the attention of the consumers to the new 

 pack design, but to reassure them that nothing other than 

 the pack design has changed. All the goodness of Cookme 

 remains as before. The feeling must have been ? you never 

 know with the consumers, why take a chance. This was possibly 

 30 days back.

 A new brand of battery was launched 

 in rural Bengal. The battery was a first of its kind: two 

 batteries packed in a single sleeve. Most consumers in rural 

 areas use batteries in flashlights. And most such flashlights 

 use two cells. So this new two-in-one battery offered convenience 

 to the flashlight user; he could put one long battery instead 

 of two short ones.

 An advertisement in Bengali had 

 been created. The design of the ad was straightforward. 

 The copy announced a revolution in the world of batteries. 

 In Bengali the ad said ? ?Battery-r jogote jugantar?. 

 The ad was researched. The most significant learning from 

 the study was that the consumers thought that the then reputed 

 Bengali newspaper called Jugantar is coming out with 

 this new battery. This was 30 years back.

 At most times the task seems undemanding. 

 The consumer seems intimate enough. Isn?t she your wife 

 or at worst your neighbour?s? Yet ever so often the marketer 

 encounters an unanticipated consumer response to a trigger 

 that he had thoughtfully crafted. They expose his unfamiliarity 

 with the idioms of the world of consumers. 

 There is, of course, a very good 

 reason for it. Like the consumer, the marketer also has 

 his own reality. His is not a world of make believe. Indeed, 

 far from it. The raw materials and the manufacturing process, 

 the packaging and the price, the distributors and the transport 

 operators, the campaign creative and the media buy, all 

 these are sincere components of that world. The fact is 

 that this world is different. 

 There indeed are two distinct 

 realities ? one of the consumer and the other of the marketer, 

 both equally unfeigned. One creates the stimulus and the 

 other reacts to it. The trick is to ignore the omnipresence 

 of the designer?s world and craft the bait in terms of the 

 world that is expected to respond. That, of course, is easier 

 said than done. How often have we phoned someone living 

 in the opposite side of the globe to find that it is middle 

 of the night there? Reality of the blazing mid-day sun here 

 in Calcutta is difficult to get away from.

 True, misinterpretations do not 

 happen every time. But it can and does happen to the best 

 of us. Whenever they do, it is due to our inability to distinguish 

 between the worlds. This is what prompts Cookme to be cautious. 

 A product is what you sell, but 

 a brand is what she buys. This, they say, is the most crucial 

 marketing lore. It also inevitably is the most frequent 

 victim of amnesia.

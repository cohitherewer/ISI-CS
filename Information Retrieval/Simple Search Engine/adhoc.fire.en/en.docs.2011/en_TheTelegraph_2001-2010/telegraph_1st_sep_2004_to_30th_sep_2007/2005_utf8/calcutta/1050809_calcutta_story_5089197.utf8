 Student forum for free speech

 August 8 was the 140th birth anniversary of Lady Abala Bose, wife of scientist AJC Bose. In honour of her memory, the montessori kids of Brahmo Balika Shikshalaya had a song, dance and prayer session. The highlight of the day was a tree plantation programme, on the school grounds.

 Forum for Arts Students, (FAS), has brought about a fresh whiff of air for the student community in JU. Formed against the backdrop of the recent police excesses on the engineering fraternity, FAS is a platform for decentralised dialogue and independent views for all students. On July 22 was a panel discussion organised by FAS ? ?Student movements versus moral and authoritarian policing?. 

 The DSA auditorium of comparative literature was packed with eager students as veterans and youngsters exchanged views. With the topic under discussion swaying almost always towards June 10, the black day of police atrocities, educationist Nabarun Bhattacharya generously praised the perseverance and wisdom of the students facing the attack, vehemently criticised the lack of popular support despite widespread lip-service and gravely warned the students about the authorities, who, he claimed from experience, would strike again. 

 Speaking along the same lines, academician Sunanda Sanyal expressed his worries about the youth today being at risk and the largest chunk of the student population tugged at all ends to the needs of the various political parties. 

 The views of CU Prof Sunandan Chakraborty contrasted sharply with the others. He asked the students to indulge in introspection ? whether the action of the engineering students were at all moral and whether we gave the authorities any other option but to resort to police action on June 10. To make light of the popular murmurs of protest rising from the audience, he also advised the use of laughter and satire as a weapon to all oppressors of free thought. 

 The amused audience was treated next to a darker shade of Chakroborty?s views when JU economics professor Goutam Gupta justified the decisions of the authorities during the engineering department fiasco by speaking about the supposed breach of the sanctuary called JU that had eminently called for trouble. 

 But all views were thrown helter-skelter when Saswati Ghosh, professor of history at CU, raised instinctive questions about the relativity of truth and opinions. Once a DSF (Democratic Student Front) worker herself, her ?woman?s sensibilities? compelled her to plead to the students to be more accommodating and large-hearted and not discriminate between their friends of different political affiliations. While rubbishing the supposed code of conduct proposed by the JU authorities, she also criticised the lack of initiative on the part of agitators once they held similar posts of responsibility. 

 JU medical faculty and witness to the June 10 atrocities Dr Anshuman Chatterjee spoke about the general ?commodification of education? and the situations that compel students to a movement but it was the young general secretary of Fetsu, Amit Chakraborty, whose experiences and views struck a chord with the students. 

 ?Why must education be coloured by a set of beliefs to be adhered to? Why must one?s placement depend on the degree to which one supported the dominant power? Why must we youngsters be forced to perceive the world not through our own eyes but through the red-tinted glasses of our benefactors? Is this what welfare and democracy is all about?? he wondered.

 Gathering the myriad opinions into a coherent whole, the moderator, made it clear that FAS did not adhere to any of the views expressed and its intentions was only to initiate dialogue to make people think.

We were the only college to attend the discourse. There were slide shows and video screenings to impart information on the US and its people.

 Fun, excitement and entertainment ruled the campus at the Interact Club of Don Bosco Park Circus?s annual fest Amigo 2005. Various schools participated in a myriad on-stage and off-stage events with the theme ?Don?t just live? exist?. The vast spectrum of events included a classroom project on meningitis and an NGO event.

The off-stage events comprised treasure hunts and modified forms of boating and scrabble. The on-stage events included Ami-Knock Out (medley), Ami-Itihaas (dramatics) Ami-Panache (fashion show) and Ami-Nritya (dance). 

 The medley consisted of three rounds of Pictionary, dumb charades and dubbing. The drama was based on great Indian historical characters like Lakshmibai, Mangal Pandey and Bhagat Singh. The fashion show was the highlight of the evening. The portrayal of bold themes, even more boldly, invited a grilling question-answer round by the judges. Next, the dance competition followed, where the audience witnessed some fancy footwork from the school students.

 Talking theatre

 Third theatre is an effective way of highlighting issues. In this case, the occasion was the commemoration of the sale of a thousand copies of The first omnibus of original English third theatre text, through Parnab Mukherjee?s Transcreated ? Raktakarabi and other performance texts. 

 Presented by Mansi Publications and Crossword, the performance at the Elgin Road bookstore touched on many relevant topics. The dilemma of trying to live and not just exist against the backdrop of terror and injustice found expression as the audience was taken on a journey of self-exploration by Parnabda and his team. 

 What it is to be a woman ? Janardan Ghosh?s take on the thoughts of Bishu about Nandini in Tagore?s Raktakarabi voiced the deep hidden curiosity in all men. 

 What caused a student in Manipur to set himself on fire, blaming the Indian Army? What caused Manipuri women to parade naked in front of the establishment? Was it because of Thangjam Manorama?s death? Footage of the atrocities took the audience through the trauma. 

 The media and the government throng Mumbai during the flood. The Prime Minister salutes the spirit of Mumbaikars. Where were they when catastrophic floods swept through Manipur in July 2004? 

 We relax in multiplexes and malls, while Dalits continue to be illtreated. People die due to uranium radiation in the villages of Jamshedpur, but few remember the Chernobyl disaster. Hindus and Muslims massacred each other during the Gujarat riots, but the exit polls during Narendra Modi?s second term read 127-51-4. 

 Parnabda, Janardan Ghosh, Joie Chatterjee, Anwesha and others took us through myriad topics. The music by Insomnia and Jackrabbit was a reflection of the troubled times, while Suha?s lilting rendition of Kabiguru?s Chokher aamar, trishna, represented the human spirit rising like a lotus from chaos and atrocities.

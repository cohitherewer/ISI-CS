 Tiny-tome collector eyes record book

 - Miniature texts bridge religious divide

 Size does matter in Mehmood Imran?s library. His books come in inches. 

 The Hong Kong-based freight management company employee has a collection of miniature religious texts, ranging from 1.5 cm to 4 cm. And now he is aiming for a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records. 

 The Records Research Services section of the Guinness has informed him that there is no record existing in the category in which he has submitted his bid ? the smallest Guru Granth Sahib in the world. 

 ?The copy fell in my hands by pure luck,? beams the 43-year-old, tenderly leafing through the 1.17 inch wide, cloth-bound book at his father?s Ripon Street home. Imran is an avid buyer through online auctions. ?That is the best place to get hold of great collectibles.? One night he entered a bid for what was posted as a copy of The Koran. ?The words were so slanted that it appeared to be in Meghrib script, of North Africa, which is quite rare. So I was eager to get a copy.? But after the auction, the London-based seller sent him an apologetic message that though she had listed the book as a Koran, she had found out that was not the case and she had no idea what it was. I asked her to send the book in any case.?

 Thus Imran became the proud possessor of the mini Guru Granth Sahib. ?Hardly three-four copies of it exist. One, in the Golden Temple of Amritsar, I hear, is incomplete. I am lucky that mine is in such good condition.?

 Imran?s collection straddles all religions. ?I have The Torah, The Zen Avesta, The Bible and The Koran as well.? In fact, he has as many as 150-plus copies of The Koran and 50-odd copies of The Bible, of which the oldest dates back to the late 17th century. 

 Most of the texts come in metal lockets. ?The Koran, The Zen Avesta and The Guru Granth Sahib seem to have been published by the British for their Indian soldiers to wear round the neck or on the forearm when they were away on the battlefield during WW I.? But his major regret is he has not heard of a miniature Bhagvad Gita. ?That would have completed my collection,? he sighs.

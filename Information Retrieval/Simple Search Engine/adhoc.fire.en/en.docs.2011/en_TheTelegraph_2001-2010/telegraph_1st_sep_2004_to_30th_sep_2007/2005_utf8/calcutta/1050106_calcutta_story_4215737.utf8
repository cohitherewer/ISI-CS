The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Builders irked by ?private? clauses

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Slamming the stipulations for picking private partners in joint-sector real estate projects as ?unfair?, Calcutta developers have called for a level playing field for large-format developments in and around the city.

 ?The built-in preconditions automatically disqualify city builders, while paving the path for a clutch of outstation and even overseas players to get involved in the development of our city,? laments Pradip Chopra, secretary, Credai (Confederation of Real Estate Developers? Association of India)-Bengal.

 The umbrella body of city builders is sending representations to state housing minister and West Bengal Housing Board chairman Gautam Deb, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), urging a re-look at the ?impractical riders? to identifying private partners.

 The state government, CMC and the CMDA recently floated tenders, offering large chunks of lands for development by private players as private-public enterprise. The bid document specified that the private partner should have developed at least a million square feet every year during the past five years and have a net worth of more than Rs 100 crore, among other clauses.

 ?These norms have virtually shut the door on local developers, who are even today faced with archaic laws such as the Urban Land Ceiling and Regulation Act, the Land Reforms Act, etc,? says Jugal Khetawat, president, Credai-Bengal. 

 He feels the government should only look at the ?financial strength of a developer and its capacity to execute a project?.

 The Land Ceiling Act, which prevents a developer from holding more than 500 sq m (7.5 cottahs), has been ?abolished in all the other states?, but is still applicable in West Bengal. The representation also accuses the authorities of ?arbitrarily? selecting joint-venture partners for Housing Board projects in New Town, Rajarhat.

 ?Some of the private partners picked have no track record of having undertaken any developmental work in the past, while developers with watertight credentials and brilliant track record are kept out of the fray,? the Credai-Bengal secretary alleges.

 The developers? forum believes many city builders are competent enough to execute 100 acre-plus projects. ?We are demonstrating our capabilities in South City. However, within the city, such large chunks of land are scarce. So, how are we expected to have a large turnover?? asks Sushil Mohta, a director of South City.

 The letter has also flayed the government for ?helping create monopolies? and depriving home-seekers from having apartments at ?competitive prices?.

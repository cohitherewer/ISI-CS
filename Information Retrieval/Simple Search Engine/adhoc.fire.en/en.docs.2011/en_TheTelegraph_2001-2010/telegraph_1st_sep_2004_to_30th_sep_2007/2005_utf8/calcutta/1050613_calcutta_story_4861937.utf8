 It's Your Birthday So...

 Full of thoughts and ideas, you have the acumen of a business person but the ambition of an artist. Don?t let imaginary guidelines overshadow reality. In love, you are honest and open-minded. You have an active mind and a curious nature, always asking questions. You are self-reliant and have a good memory. You?ll never learn to save money. ? Kusum Bhandari

Does your PC groan while playing Half Life 2 

or FIFA 2005? The culprit could be the graphics card. 

For the average home user, a motherboard with in-built 

graphics system could be enough, but the hardcore gamer or multimedia professional 

needs a lot more.

AGP (Advanced Graphics Port) is the popular pick. 

On a tight budget, an AGP card with 128 MB Video RAM and 6.4 GB per second memory 

bandwidth is a good bet. Try Geforce FX 5200 and Radeon 9550 models, which should 

cost between Rs 4,000 and 5,000. Remember to check for DirectX 9 and OpenGL 1.4 

compatibility. High-end chipsets like nVidia Geforce 5900 or ATI Radeon 9700 with 

256 MB Video RAM would come for Rs 13,000-35,000.

But the dominance of AGP cards may soon be over, thanks 

to PCI Express. Chip-maker Intel and industry giants IBM, Dell, Compaq, HP and 

Microsoft are behind this technology, designed for use in enterprise, desktop, 

mobile, communications and embedded platforms. 

PCI Express was designed as a general-purpose interface. 

The usefulness of an interface is determined by the data bandwidth it can provide 

between the system and peripherals. Higher the bandwidth, greater the data that 

can be moved between devices such as a network and other components.

The limitations of the PCI standard led to the development 

of PCI Express. For some technical details, unlike the traditional PCI Bus where 

a single parallel data routes all data at a set rate, PCI Express Bus architecture 

comprises serial, point-to-point wired, individually clocked ?lanes? that carry 

data upstream and downstream. 

The technology presents an attractive proposition 

for motherboard manufacturers. The number of trace-routes on a motherboard would 

be considerably reduced by the adoption of point-to-point circuitry, thus significantly 

cutting costs of manufacturing motherboards in future. Further, since each lane 

is exclusively used for communication between two points, the available bandwidth 

does not need to be shared.

Other pluses include lower power consumption, high 

wattage to graphics cards, peer-to-peer communication and the capability to link 

several graphics cards together.

Intel is already shipping PCI-X based 925, 915P and 

915G motherboard chipsets for Pentium IV processors. Motherboards for AMD64 are 

also becoming available with this technology. PCI-X graphics cards like ATI Radeon 

X600 XT and NVIDIA GeForce PCX are already a hit with gamers. 

It remains to be seen how soon game developers start 

making full use of this hardware muscle. However, the future of computer graphics 

is sure to revolve around PCI Express.

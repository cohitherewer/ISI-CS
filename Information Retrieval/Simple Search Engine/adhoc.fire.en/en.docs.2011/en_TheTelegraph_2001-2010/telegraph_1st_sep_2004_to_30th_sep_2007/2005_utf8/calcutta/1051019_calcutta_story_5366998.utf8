The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Of typical people, yet atypical

 - ?A suitable boy? turns the pages of memory at the reading of his latest novel

 Vikram Seth is buried in a book-signing spree while a serpentine queue fidgets to get close to him. Just then, someone hands him an ageing but carefully preserved khata, with The Doon School inscribed on its cover.

 Seth clutches the copy, leafs through it and exclaims, ?Oh my God!?. His schoolboyish scrawl has been red-inked by the keeper who treasures it. 

 ?What do you want to do when you grow up? I will join the Indian Foreign Services!? Seth reads out from his khata, as his family members and friends burst out laughing.

 Amidst the cacophony, Seth asks for a photocopy of the khata to be sent to him.

 On Monday evening, when Penguin launched his Two Lives, the famous writer of A Suitable Boy was very much the family man the two books show him to be. Happy to meet mashis, pishis and cousins ? all of whom came armed with a copy of Two Lives ? Seth seemed perfectly at home in the city of his birth.

 Before the ?family reunion? began, the spotlight was all on Seth the communicator, who knew just how to keep a select audience filling up the Taj Bengal Crystal Hall riveted to every word he spoke. 

 Perched on the armrest of the sofa or standing, walking or stopping abruptly ? Seth?s book-reading session was as enjoyable as his writing.

 The 53-year-old author began by reading the first two pages of Two Lives, which introduce him as a teenager and the two main characters ? his great-uncle Shanti and his wife Henny ? in their London home. ?I am not sure if my parents would have allowed me to go to England had Shanti uncle not been there. Uncle was very strict with me and Aunt Henny was first cold but slowly warmed up,? said Seth, casting the book aside.

 From then on, it was all impromptu. Just memories. About the days when he had to learn German ? forced by a university regulation ? to how knowing the language helped him know the couple better, his decision to write the book and the chance discovery of a bunch of Henny?s letters.

 ?The book is typical, (yet) atypical. About people who were ordinary, yet extraordinary? I think it?s the most personal of all my books,? he pondered aloud, sipping on some white wine.

 Questions from the audience revealed some interesting nuggets ? that he learnt Chinese because he was obsessed with their poetry, that his interest in western classical music was deepened by Schubert or that he wouldn?t have become a novelist had he not read Pushkin?s verse novel Eugene Onegin. 

 Incidentally, he touches upon all these in Two Lives.

 ?I always have a Pushkin stanza in the beginning of every book,? said Seth, moving on to his background in Indian classical music. ?I am embarrassed? but not really embarrassed, to say that recently when I was at a bookstore in Bangalore, I bought the music CDs of Awara and Bobby,? he laughed.

 Coinciding with the launch of Two Lives, Penguin has also come out with new jackets of seven of Seth?s earlier books, including poetry ? the genre he writes in the most, but rarely publishing. ?My Shesher Kabita, if there was one, would be in poetry,? he signed off.

 Then, the book-signing. Tired of being on his feet, he slipped into a sofa. After a flood of fans had had their copies of Two Lives autographed, German consul-general Gunter Wehrmann crouched down with his copy. Seth switched to fluent German, amidst the medley of languages.

 ?Vikram!? the feeble cry from an elderly lady vaulted every language barrier. The author turned around, a smile lighting up his face, and hugged her. Yet another acquaintance, old but never forgotten.

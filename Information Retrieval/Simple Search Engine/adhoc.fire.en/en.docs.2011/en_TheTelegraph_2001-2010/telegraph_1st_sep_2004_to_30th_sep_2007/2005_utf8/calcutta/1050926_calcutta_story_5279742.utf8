 Many moods of Tagore

 Tagore has portrayed monsoon through the deepest human emotions. In his songs of nature, autumn is invested with a gentle, pristine glory upon being touched by rain. His immortal compositions about the rainy season kindle a thousand thoughts, moods and memories, that are reflected, as it were, through the sparkling raindrops as they descend on earth. To the poet, the season, at times, evokes feelings of autumnal celebration and, at others, resonates with the still, sad music of humanity. This evening?s programme of Rabindrasangeet offers a melodious mix of renditions that attempts to trace through the metaphor of rain the transformation in theme and presentation as one progresses from the songs in Prakriti to those in Puja. Biswa-binarabey biswajan mohichhe, Timir-abagunthaney badan tabo dhaki, Esechhile tobu asho nai (on monsoon), Aamar raat pohalo sharad praatey, Sakarun benu bajaye ke jaye, Kaar banshi nishibhorey (on autumn), Eki labonye poorna pran and Ke boshile aaji hridayasaney (from Puja) are some of the songs to be rendered by this evening?s sole performers, siblings Manisha Murali Nair and Manoj Murali Nair. Hosted by Bhavna Records and Cassettes.

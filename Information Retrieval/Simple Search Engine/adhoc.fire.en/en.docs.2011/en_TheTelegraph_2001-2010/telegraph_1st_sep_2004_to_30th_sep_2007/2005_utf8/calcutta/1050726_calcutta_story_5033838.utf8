The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Honest offer from airline

 - Attractive fare, lowest tax slab keep no-frills carrier airborne

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 The free fall of air fares, as fliers have noticed by now, has a flip side ? the tax component. Put the ticket price and tax together, and the trip turns out to be far costlier than promised.

 Jetstar Asia, however, has gone easy on the hidden costs. The first international no-frill airline to operate out of India announced on Monday that a Singapore round trip from Calcutta would cost Rs 6,000, Rs 1,900 less then what Singapore Airlines charges.

 And there?s more. The tax component on a Jetstar flight will be just Rs 2,170, much lower than what Singapore Airlines (Rs 5,149) or Malaysia Airlines (Rs 4,015) is offering.

 ?We are not only coming up with a very attractive fare for a Calcutta-Singapore trip, but are also providing passengers with a high-quality comfort in a Airbus A-320 aircraft,? said L.M. Khosla, general manager for Birds Travel, the general selling agent for Jetstar Asia in India.

 ?Of course, one has to pay a nominal amount for snacks and food, but we can promise that ours will not be like any other no-frill airline,? he added.

 The first Jetstar flight from India will take off from Calcutta airport at 7 pm on August 18.

 The travel and trade industry feels the airline has ?dropped a bombshell? by coming up with the lowest tax component. 

 ?With a fare of Rs 8,170, the trade industry in Calcutta will get a boost. The offer also highlights how other airlines, despite lowering the fares, are actually making people pay more,? said Anil Punjabi, chairman (east) of the Travel Agents Federation of India. 

 ?The fares are now very dynamic. But people have become smart and calculate the entire amount before taking a decision,? said Sanjoy Sett, chairman (east) of the Travel Agents Association of India.

 But why is the tax component of the Singapore Airlines fares one of the highest? 

 Bharath Mahadevan, general manager (east) of the airline, said: ?Our fuel surcharge is more than others?, but we are in the process of reviewing it.? 

 Sett, however, thinks ?high fuel surcharge? is only a ploy to dupe passengers. 

 ?Instead of increasing the fare, on which they have to pay a commission to travel agents, the airlines increase the fuel surcharge. As a result, they make the same money, while passengers are fooled into thinking that they are flying cheap,? he argued.

 If last week saw Sananda hosting a workshop on grooming and beauty in the city, this week the Bengali lifestyle magazine came out with a handbook on health-related issues.

 The book, titled Apnar Shorir was the fourth of the Sananda Sampoorna series, to be published every quarter.

 It was launched by Aparna Sen, editor of Sananda, at Crossword Bookstore on Tuesday evening. The Elgin Road store was abuzz with women who had showed up to catch a glimpse of their favourite star, up close and personal. By 6 pm, decked in their finest, a crowd largely made up of 30-plus women assembled for their date with the actress-turned-director.

 ?This is a utilitarian handbook that has been conceived keeping in mind the needs of our readers,? said Sen. The topics to be dealt with in the coming issues are also based on feedback from the readers. 

 ?We zeroed in on a few popular topics. What we have printed is not a collection of articles published in previous issues of Sananda. The pieces have been updated with facts and figures to make them more useful,? she added.

 The book addresses women?s health-related problems and solutions and the launch was supported by Nomarks, an ayurvedic skincare brand. The glossy hardcover book is available for Rs 100 at bookstores across the city. 

 Sen?s brief speech and book signing stopped all other activities at the venue for some time. ?I am leaving for Nairobi next month, when will your new film release? I don?t want to miss it,? asked one apprehensive fan. ?Even now in the United States we watch your films. I?ve always been a great fan of yours,? said another.

 Fielding questions and signing autographs, Sen finally managed to make her way through the crowd, picking up some children?s films before making her exit.

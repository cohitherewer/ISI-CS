The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 ... and not to forget revelry

 From places to work and sleep in to places to shop, eat and splurge in. This was the year when Calcutta started catching up with the rest of the country on the retail and restaurant, mall and multiplex count. Big chains dropped anchor and bigger chains scrambled to draw up city plans. The best was saved for last: a McDonald?s recce confirming big Calcutta plans.

 We pick the seven start-ups of 2005 that redefined revelry.

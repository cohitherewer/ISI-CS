The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You cant get through this week without?

 Gearing up for battle

 The rain may have finally taken mercy on our scorched souls, but dont let your defences down. Be battle-fit. Must haves: cottons, linens, mulmuls, whites, pinks, yellows, blues, tees, skirts, capris, open-toed footwear, glares, hats, caps, umbrellas, sweat-free make-up, deos... Ban: polyesters, heavy silks, terrycottons, blacks, browns, long sleeves, heat stroke, love for the outdoors.

 Losing some weight

 Shun the sweat shops and fight the bulge the natural way. Dont trudge through elaborate meals just because you have to. Juices, fruits, salads, gallons of water should keep you hydrated and happy when the heat and the humidity play havoc. Light bites and cold soups also go with the mood. If you get hooked, carry the diet forward to flaunt that hourglass figure through the year. Break the regime by indulging in beer ? but just a little, or you will see the scales tilt unhappily once more.

 Catching Bunty Aur Babli

 Drool over the dandy daddy or check out sonny dear, compare notes on the baap-beta Bachchan jodi as they appear together on-screen for the first time in Shaad Alis Bunty Aur Babli. Expect to vote for Bachchan Senior even as Junior fools around with Rani Mukherjee, seeking to satiate their wanderlust. If nothing else, the film is a good excuse to cool off in the chilled environs of a movie theatre on a hot afternoon.

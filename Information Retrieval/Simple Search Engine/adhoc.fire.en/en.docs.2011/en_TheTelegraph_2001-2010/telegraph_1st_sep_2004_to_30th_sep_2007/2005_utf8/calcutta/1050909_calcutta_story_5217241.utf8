 Bridge the divide

 Your child responds to a dog barking or a car honking, but can barely hear you calling out to him. He is intelligent, but fails to clear the school exams?

 There is a good chance that he may have dyslexia ? a neurological disorder that affects millions across the world, manifesting itself in defective visual memory of words, letters or symbols. It can hamper perception, memory, verbal skills, abstract reasoning, hand-eye coordination, social adjustment and result in poor grades and underachievement.

 Often, people with dyslexia are labelled lazy, rebellious, class clowns, unmotivated, misfits or of low intelligence. These misconceptions lead to rejection, isolation, feelings of inferiority, low self-esteem and can even cause suicidal tendencies among them.

 Vandana Kanoria, Divya Jalan and Sunita Gupta are out to change that. The Dyslexia Association of Calcutta, started by the trio six months ago, has conducted workshops to increase awareness about this disorder.

 ?The awareness factor is really low in India, let alone Calcutta. Almost 10 per cent of school-going children worldwide suffer from dyslexia. A large number of them go undetected and aren?t undergoing any sort of remedial treatment,? says Gupta.

 The forum plans to take up the cause of dyslectic students with the Bengal government, for providing extra examination time, scribes for writing and exemption from third languages. Such measures are already in place in states like Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. ?These states have understood the gravity of the problem,? says Kanoria.

 For its fourth workshop, the association has invited Dr Sumati Vasudevan of Samvardhan, Chennai, to teach Buddhi Yog to dyslectics. Buddhi Yog is a set of exercises designed to help a child generate mental energy and improve his/her memory, attention span and concentration skills. Explains Jalan: ?Professional guidance is a must. A dyslectic child can suffer from depression and frustration. He/she may even indulge in anti-social behaviour. Counselling is the only way to help the child cope with dyslexia.?

 Dyslexia occurs in varying degrees, ranging from mild to extreme. It can be genetic or it could happen due to birth trauma like oxygen deprivation or delayed labour. ?Dyslexia is not curable, but with the help of therapy, a child suffering from this disorder has an excellent chance of getting back into the mainstream functions of life,? says Gupta.

 Thomas Alva Edison, Winston Churchill, Albert Einstein, Charles Darwin and Tom Cruise are just some of the names that have fought the disorder.

 The Dyslexia Association of Calcutta has plans to open a remedial and therapeutic centre in the city. ?Before that, people need to know that dyslexia can be defeated. They must not put extra pressure on the child if they see he?s not being able to keep pace with his peers. A proper diagnosis and assessment is a must,? concludes Jalan.

 The student council of Calcutta Boys School decided to celebrate Teacher rsquo;s Day this year with great fanfare. Each student contributed a small amount beforehand, and a cake and gifts for the teachers were bought with it. Our three senior-most teachers cut the cake. The school band put up brilliant performances, while Class XI students staged a Bengali play by Rabindranath Tagore.

Stepping stone

 For 40-odd students of IIM Calcutta, it?s time to pack their bags for an eventful term in top-notch foreign B-schools.

 The Student Exchange Program at IIMC, popularly known as STEP, extends this unique opportunity to its students every year. Started in 2000, STEP has an intake capacity of around 100 students and a collaboration partnership with more than 25 B-schools across the world like Institute De Empresa, CUNY (City University of New York), European Business School and WHU. 

 Most of the affiliate universities that participate in STEP are located in Europe or the US. In order to make the students feel at home in foreign environs, the B-schools appoint ?mentors/buddies?, who start coordinating the trip with the students at IIMC as early as a month before the date of joining. And, of course, the IIMC alumni in these countries are more than eager to help.

 This year, among others, two IIMC-ians will be participating in the Internship in International Entrepreneurship programme in CBS, Denmark, where they will analyse a small start-up and complete a mini-consultancy business development project, in cooperation with the CBS faculty.

 Apart from academics, the STEP-pers have other exciting plans to make the most of their stay abroad. They have already decided on their pick of the supplementary courses on fencing, ice-skating, salsa and other diverse activities offered by the host B-schools.

 With an increasing number of IIMC-ians eyeing an international career, the STEP experience will surely work to their advantage.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Culinary prowess amidst comradeship 

 call

 Musical chairs to the tune of 

 Santana?s Black Magic Woman. Lime ?n? spoon and sack 

 race for kids, tug of war for boys to men, chipping and 

 putting and the ladies? matka race. One-for-ones 

 and beer-guzzling contest, and, of course, the heady aroma 

 of gastronomic wonders rustled up by gentlemen-turned-master 

 chefs at the great afternoon cookout?

 Traditionally held on the first 

 Sunday of February, Members? Day at CC amp;FC is a distinguished 

 dot on the city?s clubbing calendar, combining the Annual 

 Sports Day and the Members? Cookout. To be held on February 

 6 this year, it is a clambake children and parents look 

 forward to with equal ardour.

 ?There are a lot of light-hearted 

 contests like the skipping race and running backwards. Running 

 apart, there are other interesting events as well, like 

 cricket-ball throwing, football kicking and golf. It?s basically 

 an excuse to get together and let the day unfold in a collage 

 of unalloyed fun,? explains club president Utpal Ganguly.

 But the real race is for the culinary 

 crown, as the men folk, fortified by a lager or two, roll 

 up their sleeves, sharpen their kitchen knives and try their 

 hand at innovative recipes to vie for top honours in the 

 carnival-style cooking competition. A number of stalls are 

 set up by the enterprising gentlemen, one falling over the 

 other to be more innovative.

 Sample this for flavour from the 

 class of 2002. Joy Mazumdar?s ?The Taj Bengal. Established 

 in 1792 (the year the club was established). No branch in 

 Alipore?. And the menu was a sumptuous mix of muger dal, 

 dhoney patar boda and rui kaliya. The year 

 before, it was Joy Raha?s Beckti Patrani that clinched top 

 honours.

 But it was in 2000 when the weather 

 gods served up a googly at the cookout. The children were 

 warming up for their three-legged race and spoon race. The 

 men were chopping their capsicum, carrots and garlic in 

 earnest, even as the ladies prepared to chip in at the putting 

 contest, when the skies suddenly opened up.

 Rahul Kidwai?s declaration of 

 a ?happy hour? of free vodka didn?t allow the spirits to 

 sag. But since the skies refused to relent, he had to renew 

 the offer to ?happy two hours? and then further extend it 

 to a ?happy afternoon?. When the downpour finally stopped 

 and the cookout was fired to a very late and soggy start, 

 things were further delayed by Victor Banerjee, who walked 

 in very late and urged the judging not to commence till 

 he finished his ?special mangsho?.

 ?Such is the spirit of camaraderie 

 on this lazy winter afternoon that nothing can keep us down 

 for long,? proclaims a proud member. Indefatigable indeed! 

 Ballygunge Bull (formerly CC amp;FC Chronicle), 

 the club?s newsletter, records ?a special cricket match 

 of sorts between the Maataals and Betaals (The Maataals 

 outnumbered the Betaals!)?.

 If ?Uncle Chhotu? (Rawat) is pestered 

 by eager children since morning for their starting race 

 tags and golf handicaps, it?s Nitin Madan?s turn in the 

 afternoon, as he goes about distributing free rolls or chowmien 

 to the ravenous kids after a hard day?s grind on the greens.

 While the cookout carnival is 

 wild and funny, tucking into the delicious Khaw Suay at 

 the sit-down dinner on the club?s birthday bash on February 

 23 is a relaxed and charming experience. It all started 

 in the bicentennial year, 1991-92, when a string of cricket 

 matches was organised between the club and a star-studded 

 invitation XI skippered by the late Madhavrao Scindia and 

 including, among others, Gavaskar, Bedi, Engineer, Madan 

 Lal, Gaekwad and Patil.

 Ever since, February 23 ? the 

 date that marks the Madras Couriers momentous report 

 in 1792 ? is celebrated as CC amp;FC?s Foundation Day, where 

 again, comradeship is the key.

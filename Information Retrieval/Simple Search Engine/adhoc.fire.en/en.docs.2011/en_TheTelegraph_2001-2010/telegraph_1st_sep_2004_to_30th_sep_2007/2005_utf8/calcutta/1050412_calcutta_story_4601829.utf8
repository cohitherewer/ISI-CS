 How would an improvement in Indo-US relations affect Indo-Pak relations? Is the US acting as world police? Why wasn?t Narenda Modi allowed a US visa despite being a chief minister? Why sell F-16s to Pakistan and not to India?

 The questions were not fired by veteran journalists or seasoned diplomats, but by college students. And the US diplomat at whom the queries were directed readily appreciated this fact, particularly since it came from students of the institution which he once attended himself.

 Stephen J. Blake, a career member of the US Foreign Service and director of South Asia Bureau?s Office of India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Maldives and Bhutan Affairs, visited St Xavier?s College, its collegiate school and the primary school on Monday afternoon. Blake is visiting the region to ?listen and learn? after taking charge.

 It was at the St Xavier?s primary school that Blake had studied between 1957 and 1960, from Class III to Class V. ?Almost nothing has changed,? the diplomat remarked, clicking the school kids at play. ?I used to wear the same uniform and play here,? he smiled. 

 Blake?s father was also a diplomat, then posted in Calcutta. ?My interest in South Asia stems from the fact that I was a student in Calcutta,? he admitted. 

 Blake also stopped on the college grounds for a look-around, much to the delight and curiosity of the students at play during recess.

 But it was not all fond remembrance of days gone by. Blake touched on various aspects of Indo-US relations and tackled a volley of questions from youngsters at an interaction in the AV room.

 ?There are major groups of Indian Americans, who are doing really well in various fields. India and the US have been carrying out joint military exercises, unbelievable in the past. The two countries are also working on energy cooperation and a space forum,? he explained.

 According to news reports, he said, India would shortly participate in the Red Flag exercises in Las Vegas, one of the premier military exercises in the world, where the US has allowed only its closest allies so far. Blake also said President George W. Bush is to visit India early next year.

 But what impressed and interested the diplomat the most, on his first visit to India since taking charge ?last summer?, was the economic changes that the country and Calcutta is undergoing. ?It really seems Calcutta is ready to woo foreign investment now,? he said on the Park Street campus.

 Indo-US ties have improved considerably in the recent past, Blake feels. ?Earlier, we were talking past and at each other. Now we are talking to each other,? he offered.

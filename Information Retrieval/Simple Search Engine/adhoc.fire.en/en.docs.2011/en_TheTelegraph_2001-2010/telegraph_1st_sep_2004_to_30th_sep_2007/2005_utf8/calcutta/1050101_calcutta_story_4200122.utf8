The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Ouch! On the casting couch

 Continuing on the fun trip, Metro decided to sit on the casting couch to mix and match Bollywood hits with the hottest Hollywood stars and the not-so-garam Tolly brigade, and vice versa. Unbelievable, implausible, impossible... enjoy this bumpy fun ride.

 Veer-Zaara in Hollywood ? It?s difficult even for the big Hollywood honchos to master the Yash Chopra formula. Chiffon, champagne and oodles of emotions. Which Western actor do you get to make all that mushy melodrama look authentic on the big screen? Who in the West can play a Veer Pratap Singh, ready to rot in Pakistani jails just to keep his lady love happy? Who can effectively portray a Zaara Hayat Khan ready to pine away her life for a man she?s spent two days with?

 Whether his life is a box of chocolates or he?s looking for his man Friday, Tom Hanks is that eternal Hollywood romantic who can actually languish in a remote prison for 22 years and that, too, believably. As for Zaara, she has to be glamorous, yet traditional and immensely loyal. Who else than Titanic?s Rose, Kate Winslet to do the honours? Imagine Hanks and Winslet atop a tractor and passing through the mustard fields in Punjab singing Aisa des hai mera? That?s what you call Cast Away! As for Saamiya Siddiqui, Catherine Zeta-Jones can slip into lawyer?s robes borrowed from Rani Mukherjee?

Spider-Man 2 in Bollywood ? It?s difficult to spin that wide a web by the Arabian Sea. But if Strings can sing an original theme track for the dubbed version of the film, we can actually conceive a full Hindi version of the same. The good-versus-evil Marvel Comics tale made into gripping, dark cinema in the second celluloid outing of Peter Parker was one of the biggest Hollywood hits of 2004. 

 For the title role of our desi version, we need a hero who can pass off as a pizza boy and also effectively swing into the superhero mode. So, when he is not busy tongue-tied in the Rain, Shahid Kapur can fit into the spider gear perfectly. As for Mary Jane, we need a Kirsten Dunst from Bollywood ? beautiful, outgoing and a diehard romantic. We know who Shahid would like to kiss on screen in the last scene of the film but let?s not go fida over real-to-reel relationships. Soha Ali Khan would be the perfect MJ, with those magic dimples right in place. And Doc Ock? Only a Paresh Rawal can do an Alfred Molina and do it better.

 Dhoom in Tollywood ? Imagine Bollywood?s speed film of the year made in the Tollygunge studios! Impossible? Not on paper. The Scootys and Victors can replace the Suzukis and Yamahas (otherwise they will eat up the entire budget) and the Mumbai-Pune highway can make way for our flyovers (the ones that are ready that is). 

But what happens to the cast? For the cool cop Jai 

Dixit, played convincingly by Abhishek Bachchan in the original, our very own 

Jishu can be tried out. Well, Chhota B?s shoes can turn out to be too big for 

our newly wed, but he is our only option. It?s also difficult to find a macho 

funny man like Uday Chopra in Tollywood, but Tota Roy Chowdhury can definitely 

give it a shot. With those well-oiled abs right in place and a Chokher Bali 

on his CV, he can be the perfect foil to the reserved Jishu. The big challenge 

is to find a Kabir like John Abraham, who can carry the film on his biceps. While 

he hasn?t tried it before, Jeet should be able to pull of a negative avatar convincingly. 

And then Koel and Swastika can scream Dhoom machao, dhoom machao all the 

way?

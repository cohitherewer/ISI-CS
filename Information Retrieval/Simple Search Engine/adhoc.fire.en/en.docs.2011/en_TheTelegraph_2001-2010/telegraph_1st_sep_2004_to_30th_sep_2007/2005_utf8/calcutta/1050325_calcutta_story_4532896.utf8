 Waterbody fill-up raises uproar

 Residents of Fakir Para and Becharam Chatterjee Road, in Behala, are up in arms against promoters who have been trying to illegally fill up a one-bigha waterbody in the area.

 ?If necessary, we will not hesitate to shed the last drop of our blood to save the waterbody. We are aware that filling it up will destroy the environmental balance in our area,? asserted local resident Gopal Chakraborty.

 The residents of the area have organised a number of meetings, processions and demonstrations in the recent past to enlist public support for their cause.

 ?I will see to it that no one dares to fill up any waterbody. It is an offence,? emphasised local Trinamul Congress MLA Partha Chatterjee.

 Dumping of both biodegradable and non-biodegradable refuse has, however, turned the pond into a breeding ground for insects like flies and mosquitoes, and venomous snakes. The polluted water is a health hazard. There has also been an outbreak of malaria.

 The residents of the area have written to municipal affairs and urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya, the pollution control board, fisheries minister Kiranmoy Nanda, Trinamul MLA Chatterjee, mayor Subrata Mukherjee, mayoral council member (conservancy) Rajib Deb and local CPM councillor Ratna Roy Mazumdar, asking them to look into the matter.

 ?I have been informed about the problems. We will definitely look into the matter,? minister Bhattacharya said.

 Swapan Kumar Roy, secretary of Paschimayan, an organisation striving to preserve the waterbody, said: ?This is the sole source of water in an area with a population of nearly 100,000. People used to bathe in the pond and use its water for domestic purposes. Some of them started dumping garbage and carcasses in the pond, and now it has become so filthy that it is posing a threat to public health.?

 ?A few days ago, some people had come with labourers and tried to fill up the pond. We succeeded in stopping them,? said Lubdhak Saha, a resident of the area who held the lease of the waterbody till the mid-1980s.

 He added: ?The pond had been divided into 10 plots and sold off by the owners without observing any rules.?

 Bablu Roychowdhury, one of the owners, said he had purchased a portion of it after obtaining clearance from former RSP councillor Kartik Guha Roy. ?He had declared in writing that it was a plot of land and that I could purchase it,? Roychowdhury claimed. Guha Roy denied the allegation.

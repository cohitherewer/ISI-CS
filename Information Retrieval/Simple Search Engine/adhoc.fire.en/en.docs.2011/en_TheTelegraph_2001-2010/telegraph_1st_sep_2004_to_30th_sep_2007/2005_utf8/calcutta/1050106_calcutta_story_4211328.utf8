 Ready to revolt

 Drama has always proved effective in mobilizing public opinion, particularly against exploitation, oppression and other social injustices. Ganendra, a village schoolmaster, thus dreams of using theatre as a tool to awaken his fellow villagers from their stupor of ignorance, so that they become conscious of their lot in life and protest the wrongs committed against them. His dreams, though, are thwarted by vested interests, who feel threatened at the prospect of an enlightened people. But when Ekalabya, the epic archetype of devotion and loyalty, appears to him in a vision, he is convinced of the need for a movement in which the poor and the downtrodden finally rise up in revolt to avenge a long history of injustices. Ekale Ekalabya is a spirited battle-cry, urging people to join in a struggle to combat tyrannical forces and achieve equality and emancipation. Being staged as part of a theatre festival to commemorate the 11th death anniversary of Dwandwik?s founder Achintya Chowdhury, this evening?s programme also confers the Achintya Chowdhury Smarak Samman upon renowned theatre personality Bratya Basu.

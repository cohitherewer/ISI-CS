 New Town acres for Wipro

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Wipro?s second IT complex, after the one in Salt Lake?s Sector V, will come up on 40 acres in New Town, housing minister Gautam Deb announced on Friday.

 Minister Deb added that a total of nearly 300 acres have been allotted to different IT companies, including Wipro, in New Town. Another 400 acres of land, he said, have been allotted to Central government organisations.

 Deb, who is also chairman of the Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco), the implementing agency of New Town, said the decision of allotting land to the IT units was taken in Hidco?s board meeting on Tuesday.

 Wipro chief Azim Premji, during a meeting with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee last month, had sought a large chunk of land to set up the company?s second IT complex in Calcutta. Bhattacharjee had then asked housing minister Deb to arrange for the land.

 Other IT companies that have been allotted land include Bengal Unitech (50 acres), Assendes (20 acres), DLF (25 acres), Keppel Asia Limited (25 acres). 

 ?We have also allotted 45 acres to Webel for distributing it to the entrepreneurs intending to set up small units. Hundreds of small entrepreneurs have applied for land in New Town. Webel will allot 15 acres for medium units and 30 acres for small units,?? the Hidco chairman said.

 This apart, 100 acres have been earmarked for IT-related firms and housing complexes for IT employees. 

 ?About 400 acres have been allotted to Central government organisations, including Coal India, BSNL, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, the BSF, CISF, CRPF, Railways, oil companies, the air force and the army.

Abhijeet Sawant may have won the much-coveted Indian 

Idol title, but the competitors who didn?t make it are certainly not shying 

away from the limelight. Their latest appearance: an evening of music and fun, 

but all for a cause.

 Conducted by the CII (Confederation of Indian Industry) Young Indians, a starry musical extravaganza with four of the top 10 finalists from the popular reality show Indian Idol rocked the crowd at Nazrul Mancha on Saturday evening. 

 Prajakta Shukre, Harish Moyal, Rahul Saxena and Vishal Kothari were at the Southern Avenue open-air stadium to belt out soulful melodies for the fundraiser promoting primary education among underprivileged children.

 The programme finally came to an end, much to the disappointment of the crowd, at 9 pm. The finale was a rendition of the National Anthem, sung by not only those on stage but the 3,000-odd audience members as well.

 Kantha craft

 She has been known for her efforts to uplift the ?stitch painters of Bengal? for quite a few years now. This time, Shamlu Dudeja is all set to take kantha stitch to the global stage. Not only will the designer showcase her work at the North American Bengali Conference (NABC) in New York in July, but before that she will display her creations at an exhibition in London this June. 

 ?I have had exhibitions in Washington, London and New York quite a few times in the past, but this is the first time my creations will be showcased at a fashion show, which will be held during the NABC,? smiles Dudeja.

 While the revivalist designer has been focusing mostly on ethnic wear till now, the collection that she will take to the world stage will include lots of Indo-western clothes as well. Kurtis, wrap-arounds, tops and scarves are her latest innovation with kantha stitch.

 ?I want to showcase to the world that a traditional craft form can be used to adorn modern clothing. My motto is to expand the scope of kantha so that it generates employment for more and more village girls,? stresses Dudeja.

 Saris, shawls, dupattas, throws, bedcovers, single-layered and multi-layered quilts are her other offerings this season, which will also form part of her collection for the shows abroad. 

 While she has always worked with these basic forms, this time there?s a lot that?s new in terms of motifs and embellishments. Traditional Bengali motifs of elephants, owls and floral patterns have been combined with paisleys, Worli paintings and Australian aboriginal art and embellishments like sequins and beads have been blended with embroidery. 

 Newer fabrics like georgettes and crepes as well as the usual silk, tussar and cotton have been used to create the outfits and the drapes. Lots of fresh pastels like green and pink and off-beat colours like rust find place in the palette along with the off-white, black and maroon shades.

 ?Traditionally, the base colour for kantha-stitched pieces were usually white or off-white. But we introduced brighter colours like black, navy blue and maroon, and this time we have further extended the palette to pastels as well. The attempt is to modernise the traditional stitch as far as possible,? says Dudeja. 

 Couture class

 Designer duo Ayan and Pritika Sarkar of the label Couturewalla has come up with yet another classy collection. zUsing the theme of antiquity redefined, Ayan believes in ?getting back to our roots and coming up with a novel idea from there?. 

 Enhanced with an urbanised and modern look, the antique embroidery which is their trademark comes out looking fresh, yet classic.

 ?Before every collection, idea or theme comes the research factor and with it a creative approach,? he adds. Using mostly georgettes, bits of silk and lots of surface ornamentation, the simplicity of the ensembles combines a richness in heritage.

 Normal dyes and batik work act as a base for many of the saris, while machine enhancement, intricate handwork and the use of abstract motifs add to the unique effect.

 On the colour front, bright and earthy rule the collection, with an abundance of red, orange, maroon, rust and beige. Placed in the category of ?smart trousseau? wear, the saris are priced at Rs 15,000 and above.

 The label can be found at Espee on Rawdon Street and Ogaan at Southern Avenue.

 New tunes, novel toast

 If Bin tere sanam seems monotonous and Woh lamhe fails to get you going, chances are youve been spending too much time in the night clubs.

 Tantra at The Park offers a welcome change with The Loop, where DJs specialising in different genres of music will make guest appearances once a week.

 DJ Nawed from Mumbai was the first one to turn the tables on Saturday night. The DJ plays commercial and tribal music, but Funky House and Hip Hop are close to his heart, too. He mixes tribal beats and electronic sounds with commercial tracks.

 The Saturday session started with Dus bahane and Deedar de from the movie Dus. He then moved on to Drop The Pressure, The Weekend and Put Your Hands Up In The Air. Enough for the party people to get grooving.

Mix it up

 The scene at Cloud 9 this Saturday night was a shade different from the usual jam-packed house with regulars rocking to racy numbers. The focus shifted from the floor to the bar-top with celebrity bartender Joed Lobo from Mumbai whipping up magic mocktails for one and all.

 Crimson, magenta, purple, orange ? not the hues of spaghettis or tees, but of the myriad beverages that the mixologist dished out at the Astor resto bar.

 Lobo, the resident bartender of Bar H2O in Mumbai, specialises in fresh-fruit mocktails. Usually, bartenders use flavoured liquors and syrups to prepare mocktails. But I feel fresh fruits work best in terms of taste and are very refreshing too, said Lobo.

So, Saturday night was all about Hazel (pineapple 

juice and coconut cream shaken with Bacardi, peach Schnapps and blue Curacao), 

Ronella (vanilla-infused vodka, fresh sweet lime, lime juice and cranberry juice) 

and Blonde (vanilla-infused vodka blended with apple juice and crushed ice)? And 

we must say it all went down quite well.

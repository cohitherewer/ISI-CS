 Calcutta woke up to a soggy Tuesday, with the sky overcast and the rains intermittent. Despite the shower and the drizzle, the minimum temperature rose to 17.8 degrees Celsius, four degrees above normal.

 Officials at the regional meteorological centre at Alipore said the sudden showers, starting Monday night, were brought on by an extra-tropical atmospheric system ? known in meteorological parlance as a western disturbance ? that had developed in the north-western part of the country a week ago and had advanced to the city.

 ?The system included a low-pressure area lying over south Bengal, north Orissa and Jharkhand since Monday. This was accompanied by a cyclonic circulation in the upper air that helped bring in moisture from the Bay of Bengal. This led to the formation of clouds and then, the rains. The sky will remain cloudy until the low pressure has moved eastwards in the next two days,? an official said.

 The North Wind was, consequently, blocked and the minimum temperature rose. The day temperatures will be below normal, as the sun is under constant cloud cover, the weatherman added.

 Met officials said the minimum temperature is expected to climb on Wednesday, as a warm wind from Bay of Bengal is entering Calcutta.

 After the system passes over, the sky will clear and the North Wind blow unhindered.

 ?There will be another cold spell, when the minimum temperature is expected to dip about three to four degrees,? said K.K. Chakraborty, chief of the Met office at Alipore.

 Elaborating on the unexpected showers on Monday night, officials said during this time of the year, a moisture-laden wind from the Mediterranean Sea often travels to Afghanistan, Pakistan and Kashmir, setting off rains and snowfall there.

 This moisture-laden wind travels to Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Then, it veers in an approximately east-north-east direction, leading to dense fog and rain in the belt.

 ?This system caused the rains in Kashmir and rain and snow in Darjeeling over the past few days,? said an official.

 The system, that includes an area of low pressure, generally passes over Calcutta at a height of 3 km to 5 km. But, on Monday, it dipped to an altitude of 1.5 km.

 ?There was also a cyclonic or clockwise wind circulation in the upper air, that sucked in moisture from the sea. As the system was low, the clouds could not hold the water and the rains came down,? an official said.

 The low pressure is, however, moving eastward and is expected to pass through Bangladesh and north Bengal in another two days. 

 Once the skies clear up later in the week and the North Wind is allowed smooth passage, the chill might finally set in.

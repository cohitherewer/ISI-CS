 Pyar Mein Twist

 Widower Yash Khurana (Rishi Kapoor) and widow Sheetal Arya (Dimple Kapadia) fall in love against the wishes of their children. They even elope to spend time with each other and hope that their ?companionship? will be accepted by friends and family.

 Rishi is an absolute joy to watch ? from swaying to Khullam khulla pyaar karenge to getting drunk on the beach. Dimple is good in parts and indifferent in others. Whenever she is in form, the Bobby pair makes for some classic moments on screen. Watch out for the close-dance sequence at the restaurant and the ?first hug?. 

 The acting by the rest of the cast is commendable. Vikas Bhalla makes a strong comeback as Rishi?s son. Soha Ali Khan has a couple of scenes and she does them well. So does Sammir Dattani. Farida Jalal is lovely.

 Lifted or original, kudos to director Hriday Shetty for attempting a theme like this in the Bollywood scheme of things.

 Jatin-Lalit?s music is a big letdown. Apart from Pal tham gaya, no song has any recall value. A good score could have worked wonders. 

 The pacing is too slow, especially the second half. Two songs can be easily chopped off for smarter impact.

 First weekend watch: 82 % at INOX (Forum), 66% at INOX (City Centre)

 Don?t miss: Emma ?Spice? Bunton making a special appearance in the sagaai song very early in the film.

 Last word: Go for the old wine in the old bottle itself ? after all, it?s a taste that grows on you.

 May Queen quotient

 The mercury climbed higher on Saturday night when a bevy of beauties fought tooth and nail for the May Queen Ball crown at the ordnance Club. 

 This year we had 28 applicants out of which we shortlisted 16. Stage presence and smartness is what we looked for, said Colonel MK Chaudhary, president, Ordnance Club.

 The jury consisted of ex-cricketer Arun Lal, actress June, designer Sharbari Datta, singer Usha Uthup and the First Lady of the Club Saroj Chaudhary. 

 The event, which has come to be a red letter day in the calendar of most clubs, had all the trappings of a professional beauty pageant. The introductory round was followed by an ethnic round, which in turn was followed by the third and final round in which the girls added to the May heat in stylish gowns. 

 Before Saloni Sharma was adjudged the May Queen, singer Usha Uthup decided to do what she does best: make people dance to her tune. The club crowd grooved to Shan se, Rambha ho ho, Krishna Krishna and Dhoom. 

 Fun Formula

 Narain Karthikeyan may have retired early at the Monaco Grand Prix, but that hardly made a dent in the enthusiasm of Formula One fans in the city. BED came alive on Sunday evening, with screens across the south Calcutta nightclub beaming the most glamorous race of the season.

 As the worlds fastest cars zipped through the streets of Monte Carlo, Fosters and finger-food did the rounds through a gathering of people a couple hundred strong. The action continued through the ad breaks as well, when F1-related questions were posed, though trivia was clearly not this audiences strong suit.

 The tension was palpable at a number of critical junctures of the race, like when Minardis Christijan Albers caused a traffic jam on lap 23 and Jacques Villeneuve tried a gutsy overtake on team-mate Filipe Massa. Kimi Raikkonens impressive second win on the trot also drew loud hoots and claps of approval.

 But if the decibel level of cheers and shouts are anything to go by, it is Michael Schumacher ? not the worlds fastest Indian ? who commands Calcuttas loyalty. And though beloved Schumi is certain to lose the World Champion crown this year, the F1 culture is a clear winner in the city, with more live screenings lined up at various public venues through the season.

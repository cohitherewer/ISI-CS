 ?Logic most important in my comedy?

 Bollywood rsquo;s hit fun writer ANEES BAZMEE is finally directing a laugh riot. He tells Pratim D. Gupta why he waited this long to flaunt his forte and why he is different from David Dhawan

 Bipasha Basu with Fardeen Khan, Salman Khan and Anil Kapoor in No Entry 

 You specialise in writing comedies ? Aankhen to Mujhse Shaadi Karogi? Then why did it take you so long to direct a comedy?

 I was always recognised as a writer in the industry. And I knew that writer-directors are not usually successful. Also, directors are never credited for good comedies, which are considered to be the actors? ballgame. So when I decided to direct my first film, I wanted to showcase my directorial capabilities. 

 I made Pyar To Hona Hi Tha which had Ajay Devgan in a non-action image alongside the brilliant Kajol. The film became a major hit and the industry called it a Yash Chopra kind of a film. Then, for my second film I couldn?t have made another romance ? a set image means limitations. So, I made a thriller like Deewangee which had Ajay in a negative role for the first time.

 But now there?s No Entry?

 Having established myself as a director, I wanted to make a comedy. It was again a new challenge with people asking: ?Doosron ke liye itne achche comedy likhte hain, khud kya banaoge?? But it was Anil (Kapoor) who first came and told me: ?Anees, comedy is your forte.? He was very, very charged (up) and I started writing the film. Boney Kapoor came in as producer and that?s how No Entry happened.

 What is the basic storyline? How did you choose the cast?

 It?s a simple storyline ? when men get married, they have no entry to certain zones in life and when they enter those zones, they have to pay penalties.

 Anil had to be there. Although he has done a lot of good films, my favourite Anil Kapoor films are Ram Lakhan and Taal and I have presented him in that image in No Entry. We needed someone young and Fardeen Khan suited the role. As for the third badmaash, lively and romantic character, it had to be Salman. 

 As for the heroines, I needed someone who was a great dancer, had a nice body language and was also a good actress. My first choice was Bipasha and it?s good that she agreed to do the film. Lara, I have always liked but No Entry should be easily her best film. As for Celina and Esha, they are both very good-looking and bubbly.

The storyline sounds so similar to Masti?

 Not really. Post-interval, there?s a murder in Masti where the story takes a different turn. Not so with my film. Also, I feel, if two directors make the same film, they will be completely different since the treatments are different. The genre may be same but the films will be different.

 Many are mistaking No Entry as a David Dhawan film...

 Maine David ke liye bahut likha hai. I have written as many as 10 to 15 films for him. But I don?t think our styles are the same. I feel his is a very loud comedy. When he doesn?t get the fusion right, he tries to salvage the scene through loud laughs. For me, logic is the most important thing, not buffoonery. The comic punches and timing are very crucial, which you can also find in the David Dhawan films I have written.

 But you were upset with David over Mujhse Shaadi Karogi?

 I was very angry with both him and the producer. I am an honest writer and even after completing 50 films as a writer, I still stay up till 4 in the morning writing scenes. So when I found that they changed the climax of the film in just two minutes, what I had written over three months, mujhe laga ki bahut na-insaafi hai. I still believe had they made the film with my ending, Mujhse Shaadi Karogi would have run for another 10-15 weeks.

 What next from Anees Bazmee the director?

 There?s a thriller named Benaam with Ajay Devgan, Sameera Reddy and Bhumika Chawla. I am also slated to do Ajay?s next home production. We are still finalising the script and the cast.

 And will you still write for other directors?

 I will never stop writing. My director friends in the industry won?t allow me to do that. People like Abbas-Mastan, Harry Baweja and Deepak Shivdasani have told me that I can make my own films but should write films for them every year.

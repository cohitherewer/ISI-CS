 Pick your pool point

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 According to Feng Shui, it is auspicious to have a swimming pool in the centre of the northern or eastern portion of the house. But it should not touch the north-east point. The south should be strictly avoided as this means a direct clash of fire and water elements

Q: I have bought a large plot of land in Delhi where I will be building a farmhouse for the family. The entrance to the plot is from the north. I want to build a swimming pool, preferably in the back of the house, in the south, for privacy. Is this in accordance with Feng Shui principles? If not, please suggest the right area for the pool.

 Manas

 THE SOLUTION: Swimming pools should never be built in the southern sector of the house since this area is ruled by the fire element. Having a swimming pool here brings a direct clash between the water and fire elements.

 Moreover, the southern sector of the property should never have a depression at the ground level.

 It is most auspicious to have a swimming pool built in the north or the east of the property. Care should again be taken that it does not touch the north-east point, otherwise it will interfere with the energy line that runs from north-east to south-west of the plot.

 Ideally, it should be located in the centre of the north or eastern side.

 Sacred space 

 Q: My date of birth is 15.11.1991. We are going to shift to a new flat where the main entrance is from the south. Is this auspicious according to Feng Shui? Also, where should we have our puja room? I also want your tips regarding how I should do up the room so that it helps my education and concentration.

 Sai

 THE SOLUTION: There is no problem with a south entrance. What you should check instead is whether the flat is airy enough and has windows in the north and east. This way the pious energy of the north-east flows into the house without any hindrance. There is no point entering a flat from the north and having the entire north and north-east blocked, which will then fall on the landing and in the corridor of the building. The temple in the house should be in the east of the north-east sector. This may also be considered a great area for studying. The calm and tranquil energy of this area helps you concentrate and focus better on studies. You should study facing the east or north. 

 Place your school books in the north-east and your pens in the west of the study table as this will invite gods blessings and creativity luck.

 You should also have a touch of vibrant colours in your room to support your weak earth element.

 Career chaos 

 Q: I was a well-placed officer with a nationalised bank. I joined the bank in 1971 and reached the position of assistant general manager gradually. But in January 2001, I took voluntary retirement with 10 years still to go for my scheduled retirement. I later realised that it was a mistake as after that I couldnt do anything much with my career. From July 2003, I have been working with a private firm, but am not comfortable here. Please guide me as to when I can expect a better job and good financial status. I was born on 11.01.1949 in Calcutta.

 B. Prasad 

 THE SOLUTION: Your decision was not wrong when you accepted voluntary retirement from the bank. We are all ruled by the planets and at times things happen in life against our wishes because they were thus destined.

 According to your pillars of destiny, you had entered a new phase of life in 2001 and hence the change. This period usually doesnt allow a person to stabilise in life. And along with this comes immense mental pressure.

 Moreover, your animal sign, horse, is clashing with the rat in the existing 10-year pillars. Keep a picture of an ox on your bedside table and one in your wallet to protect you from this clash.

 You will ease up from next year when there will be a positive change in your life, bringing with it a new job and a more lucrative financial package.

 RUSTY RED, COOL BLUE: What the new LPG taxis will look like

 After introducing green for autorickshaws and blue for buses, the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government is now set to unveil a colour scheme for taxis running on liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).

 Come August, red and blue cabs will hit the streets across the city. While the non-airconditioned taxis will be painted a rusty red with a greenish yellow motif on the sides, the airconditioned (AC) ones will be deep blue, with the same motif on the sides.

 The transport department will issue a notification prescribing the new colour scheme later this month, secretary Sumantra Chowdhury said on Tuesday.

 Hindustan Motors, manufacturer of the Ambassador, has offered to withdraw all 30 LPG taxis now plying in the city and repaint them as per the new format.

 ?Within 20 days of the notification coming into effect, we?ll repaint all existing LPG taxis. Once the notification is issued, we?re hoping to get orders for AC taxis,? said Ashwani Dubey, executive vice-president, Hindustan Motors.

 In addition to the 30 LPG taxis, another 26 LPG cars are awaiting permits from the Directorate of Public Vehicles.

 In an attempt to promote LPG among transporters, transport minister Subhas Chakraborty has recently approved permits for an additional 150 LPG taxis under the Bangla Swanirbhar Karmasansthan Prakalpa scheme. Of these, 100 permits are for non-AC taxis. Under the scheme, unemployed youths will be entitled to a government subsidy of Rs 30,000 in procuring bank loans to buy an LPG cab.

 ?We have been asking transporters to replace their old taxis with LPG cabs, but they are resisting the move,? transport secretary Chowdhury said. 

 His department has already clamped down on the issue of permits to taxis other than those running on green fuel.

 With over 36,000 taxis running in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area (CMA), the government faces an uphill task of forcing old and polluting vehicles to convert to LPG or get phased out. 

 Taxi associations have announced that they will resist the government?s move to slam the brakes on pre-1990 commercial vehicles in the city.

 Even as the government is rooting for the green fuel, Hindustan Motors, which has supplied 2,500 CNG-run vehicles in Delhi, is anxious about the fuel backup for its LPG vehicles in Calcutta. 

 ?Availability of fuel is likely to be a key issue here. We need a minimum of 40 to 45 stations, especially near the airport, bus stands and railway stations,? said a company official.

 Calcutta has only seven auto LPG dispensing stations. Another five are scheduled to come up at CSTC depots.

 Saris have been reinvented and stylised at every stage of fashion evolution. The latest line of saris at Suruchi, a store at 48A, Park Street, draws inspiration from gota patti designs.

 The traditional motifs embossed in silver adorn the crepes and georgettes unveiled at the store for the Puja period.

 The festive season is knocking on the door and shopping is at a high. Saris are the eternal choice of Indian women and Pujas are the time when Calcutta women like to make fashion statements with the nine yards of ethnic elegance, says Niranjan Lal Agarwal, a spokesperson for the store.

 Be it traditional occasions or cocktail parties, the collection offers suitable buys for them all. 

 Apart from the gota patti design, the festive range is embellished with beads, sequins, stones and threadwork. The collection comes in bright as well as sober splashes of yellow, citrine, green, and orange. 

 so on offer is a collection of pearl prints embellished with silver work.

 We have drawn inspiration from Bunty Aur Babli for some saris, adds Agarwal. It is unlikely that Babli or Bunty have been informed of this, but then that can be put down to festive frenzy. 

 Saris with the gota patti design start at Rs 1,800; the pearl prints start from Rs 2,495.

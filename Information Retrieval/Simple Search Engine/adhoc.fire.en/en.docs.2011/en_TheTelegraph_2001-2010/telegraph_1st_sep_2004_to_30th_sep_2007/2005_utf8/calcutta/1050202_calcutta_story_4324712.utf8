 Shot dead in saloon

 A STAFF REPORTER

 In a scene straight out of a gangster movie, the barber?s shop turned killing field for Mohammed Akram Ansari, 35. Ansari, a North Howrah Youth Congress functionary and resident of Pilkhana, in Golabari police station area, was shot dead by five youths who sauntered in while he was sitting in a chair, lather on his face, waiting for a shave on Tuesday morning. 

 According to police, Ansari had gone to Moonlight Saloon, a small shop located in Pilkhana Third Lane. The youths entered the shop and pumped five bullets into Ansari?s chest from point-blank range, killing him instantly.

 Emerging from the shop, the men hurled two crude bombs, fired a round in the air to scare away bystanders, and sprinted off to safety.

 ?Ansari was a history-sheeter. He was reforming himself and trying to return to the mainstream. It seems the murder was a fallout of an old dispute,? said Mihir Kumar Bhattacharjee, Howrah police superintendent.

 ?We have received a complaint from Ansari?s brother, Mohammad Aslam, in which he has named four men. They are Pappu, Laddu, Shakil and Budhua. No arrest has been made,? Bhattacharjee added.

 After the killing, local residents started assembling around the barber?s shop, criticising the police for inaction. The local police station is less than half-a-km away.

 A large contingent arrived a while later from Golabari police station and dispersed the crowd. The body was taken to Howrah District Hospital, and then sent for post-mortem. It was later handed over to Ansari?s relatives. 

 Police said witnesses could identify four of the five killers. All four had previously been arrested on charges of peddling heroin, after Ansari?s relatives had informed the police about their activities. They were out on bail.

 Police said that Ansari had made several enemies after recently stepping into the real estate trade.

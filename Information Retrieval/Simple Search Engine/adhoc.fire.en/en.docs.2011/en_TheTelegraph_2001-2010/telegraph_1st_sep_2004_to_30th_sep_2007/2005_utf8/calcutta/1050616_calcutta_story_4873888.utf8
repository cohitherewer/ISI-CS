 Letters

 Disarmed: A couple in a park with the umbrella ban 

 We cannot blame our children for sending SMSs to relatives and friends using words in short forms (?Msg: short, swift amp; soulless?, May 18). Technological advancement has made our life easy and it seems no one, child or adult, is willing to take the trouble of writing a letter. 

 SMS, that too using truncated words, has become the most convenient way of communication. We have forgotten the habit of letter-writing. How many of us write letters nowadays? To keep in touch with relatives and friends, telephones and mobiles are almost always our tools of choice. 

 The next generation should be made aware that the reluctance to write letters is harming them. They are losing their language skills and their poor grammar and spelling are resulting in poor marks in examinations. 

 Also, today?s youngsters cannot express themselves clearly in writing. As a result, they are also becoming incapable of analytical thinking. Children should be encouraged by their parents or guardians and schools to develop the habit of writing regularly. 

 Educational institutions should bring out magazines, providing a platform for students to publish their writings. Essays, short stories and poems should find a place in the magazines. The best contributors can be awarded prizes to provide them encouragement. 

 Parents should motivate children to not only write to their friends and relatives, but also write essays and fiction. All possible measures need to be taken to make the young people take interest in writing. Otherwise, an entire generation might lose a vital part of their communication skills.

 Banning umbrellas from parks (?Umbrellas barred in park?, May 24) is a bizarre joke cracked by the forest de-partment at the expense of youngsters. It is a ridiculous attempt to stop people from romancing in the park. 

 To stop such activities, it would be more effective to beef up surveillance in the parks and instal more lights. Penal measures can also be a deterrent. 

 What supposedly happens in those parks is constantly bombarded into our homes via the electronic media. There is implicit social sanction for the activities. The administration need not concern itself about such trivial matters. 

 Subhankar Mukherjee,

 Borehat, Burdwan. 

 Kudos to the forest department for banning umbrellas, large pieces of cloth and newspapers from parks. The ?pure? and ?divine? acts of ?lovers? have reached such proportions that civilised people think twice before venturing into Victoria Memorial, Eden Gardens, Millennium Park and other such tourist spots with their families, especially children, in tow. Individuals disobeying the new law should not only be driven out of the parks, but also punished in an exemplary manner.

 Road mishaps, big or small, have become commonplace in Salt Lake. And Gita Pal is the latest entry in the victim list (?Pillion rider crushed?, May 23). There are several reasons behind the spurt in road accidents in Salt Lake. Bus drivers tend to drive rashly when they enter the township. In addition, most of the main roads are in poor condition, even though the municipality has started repair work on the eve of the polls. Most importantly, traffic police are deployed only at a handful of spots in Salt Lake. 

 Sourish Misra, 

 Salt Lake. 

 The sudden boom in the sale of firearms (?Scurry for bullets in civic ballot run-up?, May 18) highlights how criminals have taken over the political set-up of our country. Bullets decide elections now. The common man will certainly feel insecure and be wary of casting his vote if goons are allowed to roam free on election day. 

 Rajdeep Guha,

 Panchanantala Road. 

 The introduction of phones in CSTC buses was a novel move (?Calling all commuters?, May 19). If the service had to be introduced, it should have been done much earlier. Due to technological advancement and economic liberalisation, mobile phones have become affordable for most people. Still, a cheap phone connection in state buses is welcome, even though it will only add to the congestion inside the usually packed buses. 

 Arjun Chaudhuri,

 Mohesh Chaudhuri Lane. 

 Apropos the article ?Council tips for quality teachers?, May 23, CISCE claim that high academic standards are maintained in all institutions under it is a sham. My son studies in a school which employs untrained teachers and is affiliated to the council. The school authorities openly say that acquiring affiliation to the council almost totally depends on money. 

 K. Ghosh,

 Baguiati. 

 Apropos the report ?Dawn fire destroys bookshop?, May 24, this is the second time such a fire broke out in College Street within a space of months. The loss of books worth lakhs of rupees occurred only due to negligence in periodically checking the electric wiring in the building that housed the shop. Those responsible for the maintenance of the building should be punished. 

 Anil Kumar Sen,

 Ram Chandra Chatterjee Lane.

 The manner in which valuable books were destroyed in a fire at a College Street bookshop is shocking. The government should look into the matter and extend help to the owner in rebuilding the damaged shop. 

 Mahesh Prasad, 

 Baidyabati, Hooghly. 

 The devastating fire at the College Street bookshop could well be an act of sabotage. The perpetrators probably want to construct a multi-storeyed building on the plot. 

 Sachindra Nath Mitra,

 Rakhal Ghosh Lane. 

 The report ?At 17, a complete hitman?, May 23, unnecessarily glorified the acumen of a teenage criminal. Don?t you think that by dwelling at length on the boy?s professionalism and planning, you are attracting youngsters to a life in crime? 

 Columbia Mishra,

 Salt Lake.

 A specialised training centre that serves the needs of toddlers, including those with special needs, and their parents ? that?s what Kislaya Playhouse and Montessori is offering. 

 The aim of Kislaya Montessori Discovery Centre, launched on Saturday, is ?the full development of children between two and seven years old, in all spheres?, said directress Vandana Kanoria.

 The specialised services create a forum ?to discover the child?s many talents while he discovers himself, through intellectual and creative activities?, simultaneously helping parents cope with their child?s problems and other parenting issues. 

 On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons and Saturday mornings, a host of activities will be available for tots, in different fields. Tune In is all about music, On Your Toes will provide training in creative dance and they can learn art and craft with Magic Hands. 

 Watch Out is classes in karate, Know Your World aims at inculcating general knowledge, while Speak Out will teach story-telling, drama and comprehension. Bit by Bit involves nature study, some tabletop cooking and table-laying, excursions and more. 

 There will be separate teachers for every subject, and the maximum capacity for each course will be about 35 children.

 ?Montessori methods, in practice for so many years, is in danger of getting lost, especially with schools starting classes for two-and-a-half to three-year-olds,? observed Kanoria. 

 ?This is very sad, since they are very effective in the early development of a child. We Montessorians are very worried about this trend, and we?re trying to do our best to save the system,? she added.

 A separate section for children with special needs will help kids with moderate physical and mental handicaps. The classes, accommodating up to around 70 youngsters, will be held on Monday, Wednesday and Friday afternoons. There will be a special educator, as well as Montessori teachers, for these children, with about five students per teacher.

 The services for parents will include workshops on handwork and child psychology. ?The first will help parents know what sort of creative developmental activities they can do with the child at home. The second subject will aid them in understanding the child?s mind. There will also be counselling for parents, especially for those with special needs children,? added Kanoria.

 All these activities, as well as consultancy for those wanting to open a Montessori school, will be held at Kislaya?s centre on Loudon Street. 

 The courses will begin on March 7, and admissions are now on. 

 ?We are offering a package for the wholesome development of the toddler,? summed up directress Kanoria.

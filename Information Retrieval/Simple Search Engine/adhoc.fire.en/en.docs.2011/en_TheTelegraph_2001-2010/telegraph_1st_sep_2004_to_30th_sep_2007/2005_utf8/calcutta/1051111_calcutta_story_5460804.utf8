 Tailor?s tag nails killer

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A tailor?s tag found in the fist of a dead man led to the arrest of his murderers ? a notorious contract killer and his associate ? in Jorasanko on Thursday.

 In a pre-dawn swoop, the city police rounded up Mohammad Nizamuddin and Mohammad Gulzar from their hideout in Jorasanko. Police have seized two sophisticated revolvers from them.

 ?In August, Nizamuddin, 32, murdered driver Aftaque Khan. The body was found in Bangriposi, on the Bengal-Orissa border. Besides, Jharkhand police have confirmed today that Nizamuddin is wanted by them for seven murders,? said Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (central division).

 On August 15, Nizamuddin, Gulzar and two others set out for a robbery they had planned in Titagarh in a hired Tata Sumo. They had lied to the driver, Khan, that they were going on a holiday to Digha, said an officer of Jorasanko thana.

 Midway, they decided to snatch the Sumo. ?They forced Khan to drive towards Orissa. At Bangriposi, Nizamuddin strangled Khan from behind with a gamchha,? the officer added.

 While struggling to break free, Khan accidentally tore off the tag on Nizamuddin?s shirt collar.

 On the morning of August 16, Bagriposi police stumbled upon the body. ?They found the tag of the Zakaria Street tailoring shop in Khan?s fist. They sent us a photograph of Khan, along with this lead,? said the deputy commissioner.

 On the basis of a tip-off on Wednesday night, a team led by inspector Salil Roy raided the Jorasanko hideout and netted Nizamuddin and Gulzar.

 Preliminary investigation has revealed that Nizamuddin and his accomplices used to take refuge in the city after committing crimes in various places of Jharkhand.

 Police also suspect Nizamuddin to have a hand in the murders of two other drivers from the city.

 Drains and the rains are residents? bane

 OUR BUREAU

 Residents of Tangra, Gobra Gorosthan, Haltu and Anandapur Industrial Area are accustomed to certain seemingly unalterable facts of life ? scarcity of drinking water, waterlogging and open drains.

 Add to that the menace of diarrhoea and skin diseases that break out almost every monsoon, thanks to the drains and the filthy water on the streets through which the residents have to wade. The problem is especially distressing in Tangra and Gobra.

 Gobra Gorosthan, in ward 59, has been a Left bastion since 1967. But the residents find hardly any reason to be indebted to the local councillor, Left Front?s Snehanshu Roy. For the past 20 years, they have lived with an acute crisis of drinking water and poor drainage.

 And at least some of them are resigned to the fact that things will remain so for many more years. 

 ?As we are not financially sound and live in a backward area, we have come to terms with the fact that the Calcutta Municipal Corporation won?t do much for us,? rued Lakshmi Sardar of Rammohan Bera Lane.

 People of Gobra Gorosthan Road, Rammohan Bera Lane and Abinash Chaudhury Lane have no option but to use boats to move around in the neighbourhood after each long spell of rain.

 In adjacent Tangra, the drainage problem is most acute in the Seal Lane, Atal Sur Road, Christopher Road, New Tangra and Chingrihata Lane areas. Nandini Sarkar, a resident of Seal Lane, said: ?We have to fall back on tubewells during monsoon as taps get submerged in water.? 

 What does CPM councillor of ward 58 Lakshimoni Banerjee have to say about the persisting problem? 

 ?After the matter was placed before municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya, the drainage and sewerage development in six east Calcutta wards, including Tangra, were made part of the Asian Development Bank?s Calcutta Environment Improvement Project. But work could not start because of the mayor?s indifference,? claimed Banerjee.

 Drainage is also a crucial problem in Haltu (ward 105), a predominantly colony area. The Left councillor for the past three terms, Sunil Chakraborty, has laid civic utility infrastructure, but around 40 per cent of the area still does not have drainage facilities.

 The other key problem in some pockets is inadequate supply of drinking water. In Anandapur Industrial Estate, for instance, residents are deprived of piped water. 

 ?We face an acute drinking water shortage all year as the civic body has not repaired over 150 tubewells,? said Dilip Das of Hossainpur. 

 In this pocket of the city, especially Tangra, the surroundings are far from hygienic ? the stench from four open drains and a slaughterhouse is overbearing.

 A predominantly small-scale industrial hub (comprising bulb, hosiery, rubber and leather units), Tangra has been a Left stronghold since 1985. Also, around 100 slums are scattered across the area. 

 Former mayor Prasanta Chatterjee wanted to convert Beleghata canal into a waterway and French experts had come over to work out the project, but the project did not take off. Both Beleghata and Palmerbazar canals are clogged by unchecked siltation and are now breeding grounds of mosquitoes.

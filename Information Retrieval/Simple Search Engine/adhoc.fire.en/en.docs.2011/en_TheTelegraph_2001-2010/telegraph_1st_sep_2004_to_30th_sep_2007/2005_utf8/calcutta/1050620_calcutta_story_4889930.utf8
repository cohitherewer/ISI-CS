The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Ballot is cast, it?s not to reason why

There were some who didnt get to vote at all and 

some who voted twice. Metro hears them out...

In his name

I am a senior citizen residing in Beleghata for the 

past 20 years. I went to the polling booth around 1.25 pm. Even though I was carrying 

my voter?s identity card, I returned without casting my vote: it had already been 

cast. 

Stunned, I asked the local CPM workers whether my 

family members? votes had also been cast. They told me, very apologetically, that 

there was no use in sending them to the booth. 

This happened for the first time in my life. And this 

occurred, despite the fact that I had been given an assurance by a local CPM leader 

that even if I came to vote later in the day, there would be no problem. Being 

a senior citizen, I had told the leader that I would prefer to come later because 

of the heat. 

My wife was more shocked. She had read and even heard 

of rigging but cannot imagine herself being a victim of it.

Triple franchise

My para was always an ?uneventful? one on election 

days.

I had always hurried home from the polling centre, 

unmindful of which kaku or dada was rallying behind which party. 

Ki re? Vote dili? A smile and nod (to imply a yes or no) was reply enough.

This once, it was different. All because I stayed 

on when I was told that somebody had already cast the vote in my name from Part 

2 of Bidhannagar?s ward 20.

The previous day, a neighbour had suggested that I 

turn up at the centre early to avoid hassles. On Sunday, 9.30 am was late enough.

A dozen strangers who had just cast their vote, without 

producing any proof of identity, walked straight back and joined the same queue 

again. The rest of us pretended not to have noticed.

I went looking for the presiding officer.

Outside the polling centre, some party workers were 

already accusing each other of rigging. By 10.30 am, a big police contingent had 

arrived.

Soon an injured woman, reportedly a Trinamul Congress 

supporter, was carried out of the building. She alleged that she had been hit 

on the head by CPM men.

The presiding officer was back in his seat when I 

went into the Part 2 polling centre at around 11 am. Three of us, who had been 

denied franchise because of a false vote, insisted on the tender vote. ?It?s no 

use casting a tender vote. It won?t be counted until and unless there is a tie?,? 

the presiding officer said.

Nevertheless, I cast my tender vote, but no indelible 

ink was put on my finger.

While he was checking my identity proof, SDO Sutanu 

Kar appeared on the scene. ?Tender vote nite baddhyo holam (I had to accept 

tender votes). Not all are producing proof of identity,,? the officer told the 

SDO. 

?Why did you go to them? I would have let you vote 

in an absentee voter?s name,? said a party worker as I left the polling station.

On my way back home, a neighbour claimed to have spotted 

my name in the voting list under Part 3 of the same ward, voting for which was 

in progress at the same polling centre. I went in to check. The polling officers 

allowed me in without any identity check and let me vote. It took me a civic election 

to know how eventful my para can be on a poll day.

Life

 Starry, starry nites

 RESHMI SENGUPTA, ZEESHAN 

 JAWED 

 The premiere of Sandip Ray?s Nishijapon on Thursday evening saw tinsel town streaming into 89 Cinemas. The screening was followed by a cocktail party at KK?s Fusion Global Kitchen ?? Lounge on the ground floor.

 Director Sandip Ray was joined by mother Bijoya Ray and wife Lolita. 

 Shimmering in a sequinned yellow-and-pink chiffon, Raima was greeted with accolades, while mother Moon Moon Sen stood some distance away, basking in her daughter?s adulation.

 Looking stunning in a dark outfit, Rituparna moved around with her husband.

 Others present included the film?s star cast ?Soumitra Chatterjee, Dipankar De, Sabyasachi Chakraborty, Parambrata Chatterjee ? and guests Dolon Roy, Subrata Sen, Kaushik and Churni Ganguly, Arindam Sil, June and Anindita Sarbadhicary.

 Glam gape

 Fusion, the resto bar at The Golden Park, seems to be packing in all the star power this month. After the Yana mania last Saturday it was the turn of the lead cast of the sex comedy Kyaa Kool Hai Hum to tickle the city?s funny bone. But the lead pair of Ritesh Deshmukh and Neha Dhupia never turned up and it was left to Tusshar Kapoor and Ishaa Koppikar to charm the party people. 

 The duo made an entry a little before midnight. Considering it was Poila Baisakh, the turnout was decent. While posing for the shutterbugs, the stars begged the crowds to stop gaping at them and return to the dance floor. ?If you?ll don?t dance we?ll leave the place after the photo session,? warned the Khallas girl.

 Idol worship

 With the lost-boy look firmly in place and a smile glued to his lips, Abhijeet Sawant obliged his fans with autographs and photographs at Prince of Cal, in Sourav?s. The first Indian idol was in the city on Thursday to promote his new album Aapka? Abhijeet Sawant, fast turning into a chartbuster. 

 ?I really don?t know how to deal with so much adulation. It?s nothing less than a fairy tale,? said the young man from Mahim.

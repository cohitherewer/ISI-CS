 A restaurant on the ground floor of Exide House, at 59, Chowringhee Road, was destroyed in a fire on Wednesday afternoon. Both owner and manager of the eatery are absconding.

 Fire brigade officials said a leak from an LPG cylinder had caused the blaze at Saima. Though two tenders doused the fire in 15 minutes and no one was injured, a major disaster could have occurred, as there were 10 cylinders stacked in the kitchen.

 The cylinders have been seized and the restaurant has been closed down. The fire services department has started an inquiry.

 Police said the fire broke out in the kitchen at noon, while a cook was preparing fast food. The flames engulfed almost the entire kitchen within a minute, prompting the cooks to vacate the room and raise an alarm. The employees called up firemen, who arrived within 10 minutes.

 Witnessing the flames and fearing a possible cylinder blast, hawkers and pedestrians panicked and rushed to safety. Police closed all adjacent shops and even the gates of the Rabindra Sadan Metro station, which is quite close to the eatery. Bhowanipore-bound vehicles were diverted.

 ?I was selling fruits like any other day. Suddenly, there was a blast and pedestrians started fleeing the spot. I thought it was a case of cops chasing criminals and promptly left with my basket,? recalled Rohan Yadav, a vendor.

 A policeman on duty at the Metro station said: ?I was sitting beside the staircase when I heard the blast. Seconds later, thick smoke billowed out of the restaurant. I rushed to the spot and found the kitchen engulfed in fire. I immediately closed the gate of the station.??

 Fire services director Gopal Bhattacharya has asked police to arrest the owner and manager of Saima. 

 ?Furniture and accessories, including electrical fittings, were gutted. The exact loss, however, has not been estimated. We are trying to find out how the owner managed to collect so many LPG cylinders. Action will be taken against him,? he asserted. 

 The director pointed out that any restaurant can store a maximum of four LPG cylinders and must take ?adequate safety measures?.

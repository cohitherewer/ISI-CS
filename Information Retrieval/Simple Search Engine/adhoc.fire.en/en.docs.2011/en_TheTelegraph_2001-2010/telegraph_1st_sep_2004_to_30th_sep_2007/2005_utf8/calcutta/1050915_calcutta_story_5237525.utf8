 Colours of life

 Reminiscent of Fauvist sensibilities, the paintings of Debjani Datta derive their impact and emotional expression from the use of rich, bold and overlapping textures and colours. The ongoing exhibition of her works finds the artist trying to achieve harmony in theme and style by evoking images of simplicity, beauty and tranquility. Resonating with passion, her paintings express her unique way of perceiving the world around her. Her dusky village belles, engaged in homely chores or depicted in moods of languor and indolence, have a strangely alluring, enchanting quality.

 Event: Paintings by Debjani Datta

 When: Till September 18, 3 pm - 8 pm (Sat and Sun: 11 am - 8 pm)

 Where: Chitrakoot Art Gallery, 55 Gariahat Road

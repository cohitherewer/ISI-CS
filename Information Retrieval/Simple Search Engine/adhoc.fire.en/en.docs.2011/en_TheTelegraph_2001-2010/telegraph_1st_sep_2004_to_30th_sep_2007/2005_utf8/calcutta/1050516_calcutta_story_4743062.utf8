 Liquor gets a new high

 A STAFF REPORTER

 After having introduced a number of reforms in the state?s liquor market over the past few years, the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government plans to embark upon expanding the now-negligible market of coloured and flavoured country liquor.

 ?A recent entrant in the market, there?s no duty structure for this product as of now. Moreover, its market has never been explored. We are going to provide the right framework for it to take off,? a senior official of the state excise department said on Sunday.

 The product is now available in strengths of 35 degree, 55 degree and 75 degree under-proof (UP) in 300 ml and 600 ml bottles. The strategy is to offer a wider choice to the consumers by introducing the product in strengths of 50 degree, 60 degree, 70 degree and 80 degree UP in bottles of 375 ml, 250 ml, 200 ml and 180 ml as well.

 ?The government does not intend to fix the price. Lack of restrictions will encourage more manufacturers to enter the market. Within a healthy competitive framework, the price is expected to go down and quality to improve,? the official said.

 ?The coloured and flavoured drink might not be able to compete with India-made foreign liquor (IMFL). But certainly, it would taste much better. So, at one level, the categories of consumers they cater to might merge?? the official added.

 Presently, the country liquor market is under complete government control, with just 13 bottling plants. The retail outlets buy from specific plants. In the absence of competition, the product quality suffers.

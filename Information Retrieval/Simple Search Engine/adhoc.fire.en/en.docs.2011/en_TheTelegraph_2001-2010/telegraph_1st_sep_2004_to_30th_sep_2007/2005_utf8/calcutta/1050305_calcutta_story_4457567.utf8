The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Hello! It?s Lionel

 Idols all: Amit Sana, Aditi Paul and Abhijeet Sawant

 Even as the SMS votes (crossed 45 million and counting) keep piling on to pick the first Indian Idol of the country, the final episode of the Sony talent hunt show is rising on the star quotient. While there?s still a question mark between Shah Rukh Khan and Sanjay Dutt as to who will be the big guest on Saturday night, the two-hour special promises to be an absolute humdinger.

Not only will the two finalists, Abhijeet Sawant and 

Amit Sana, perform on the big night, but all the other nine finalists will join 

the two for a final singalong. And guess whose composition they will sing to? 

None other than international man of music Lionel Ritchie known for his lilting 

ballad Hello! .

 ?Yes, all 11 of the finalists will sing a special song set to tune by Lionel Ritchie,? said Tarun Katial, executive vice-president and business head of Sony Entertainment Television. ?The Hindi version of the song will have lyrics written by Sameer. The song has been specially created for AIDS awareness in India and is supported by Richard Gere?s foundation. We haven?t yet decided but we may include the song in the special Sony album.?

 For Calcutta girl Aditi Paul, who couldn?t make it to the top five, it was great to re-unite with her co-finalists. ?I remember when Richard (Gere) came to meet all of us. He spoke so well and was very impressed to learn that all of us (Indian Idol finalists) were so conscious about the deadly disease named AIDS and its spread here in India. He had promised to get all of us together to fight the disease.?

 As for the two finalists, every second counts. ?We have done our bit,? said Amit. ?I am happy with the way I?ve performed in the last episode. Now, it all depends on the people of the country as to who they want to see as their Indian Idol.? 

Abhijeet is less cautious, though. ?It?s been a lovely journey right from the day of the audition to this final episode and regardless of what happens, this will remain a very special chapter in my life.?

 To make the voting process smoother, the SMS response management had been outsourced to mobile2win, a wireless promotions company and sister concern of the popular web portal www.contests2win. com. As for voting through landline telephones, Sony had tied up with service providers BSNL and MTNL.

 The final deciding episode will be shot today at 11 am in a Mumbai studio and will be telecast on Sony at 8 in the evening. The nationwide voting closes at 9 am and after two hours of counting of the votes, the first ever Indian Idol will be chosen. With TRPs of the show almost touching double figures in previous weeks, don?t be surprised if the TAM chart records are rewritten.

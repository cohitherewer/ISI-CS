 It?s raining releases

 Why the year that began with a whimper is about to end with a bang...

 Why the year that began with a whimper is about to end with a bang...

 One month. Five Fridays. Fourteen big releases. And a slew of lesser ones... In what is being billed as the big year-end Bollywood blast, hordes of stars are descending on the big screen every week this December.

 After all, it?s not every month that you have a double bill of Amitabh Bachchan, when the man himself is confined to a hospital bed.

 Add to that, twin December treats from Bipasha Basu, Ajay Devgan, Akshay Kumar, Nana Patekar, Shahid Kapur, Emraan Hashmi and Amrita Rao, and single appearances from Vivek Oberoi and Abhishek Bachchan, Kareena Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra.

 But why this sudden flurry in the last month of the year when only six Bollywood films released in December 2004 and almost all bombed?

 Multiplexes in town are unanimous in their reasoning: ?The producers cannot delay their releases because if they come any later they won?t get the requisite number of screens.?

 Pratim D. Gupta traces a slice of the silver lining on the silver screen, as you plot your month?s programme at the plexes.

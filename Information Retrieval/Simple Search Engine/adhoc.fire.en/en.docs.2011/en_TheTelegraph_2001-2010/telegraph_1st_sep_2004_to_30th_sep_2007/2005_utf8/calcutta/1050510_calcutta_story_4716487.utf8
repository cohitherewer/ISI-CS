Life

 Bear bottles

 SANGITA SULTANIA G. ROY

 Valentines Day is long gone 

 and her birthday is still a few months away. So if shes 

 already bored with all the chocolates, candies, hearts youve 

 heaped upon her, take a cue from the poignant charm of Message 

 in a Bottle and give her a teddy in a bottle.

 The nature of the messages held aloft by the tiny teddies in tiny bottles is the polar opposite of that found floating in the sea in the Kevin Costner-starrer, but it doesnt fail to tug at your heartstrings.

 What

 Teddy in a bottle

 Where

 Archies outlets in Forum and City Centre

 How much

 Rs 50 each

Barely an inch long, the glass bottles that would perhaps look more apt in a medicine store, come fitted with a wooden stopcork. Inside the bottle sits a tiny brown smiling teddy that holds out messages like You are the cutest, Hi, Good luck, etc. There are messages for various zodiac signs as well. 

 In case they dont seem to say what you have in mind, just uncork the bottle, take out the teddy and give it your thoughts to hold. Her heart may or may not melt, but at least it will give her a reason to flash that million-dollar smile.

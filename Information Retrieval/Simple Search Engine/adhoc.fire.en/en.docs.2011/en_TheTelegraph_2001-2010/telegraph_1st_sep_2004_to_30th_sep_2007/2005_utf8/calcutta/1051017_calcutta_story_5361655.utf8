The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Poet residence demolished

 Sandip Banerjee: We know that Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is a nephew of the poet Sukanta Bhattacharjee and that the chief minister is against promoter raj. But then why was the building on 32, Mahim Halder Street, where the poet lived, demolished by the CMC? Why wasn?t the house made a heritage structure?

 Thank you for raising an important issue. I will visit the site and consult the chief municipal architect and town planner to verify whether the building or any part of it had been declared a heritage structure. I will also take up the matter with the mayor.

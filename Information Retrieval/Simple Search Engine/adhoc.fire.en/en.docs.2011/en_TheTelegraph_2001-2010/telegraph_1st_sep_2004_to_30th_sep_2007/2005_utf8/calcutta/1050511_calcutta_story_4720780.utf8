The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Clash of cultures

 At a time when society is in the midst of sweeping cultural changes, Ekush Shataks Ramnidhi (written by Dr Partho Chatterjee) focuses on a period in Calcuttas history that prevailed before the emergence of modern urban culture. The play evokes subtle parallels between the situations of the past and the present, drawing attention to the process of cultural change, and the natural insecurities and clash of beliefs that attend every transitional phase in society. Set in early 19th century Calcutta, Ramnidhi tells us of the travails of a singer, Kripa Sunri, leader of a group of kabi-gaan performers. With the introduction of the famous and popular tappa musical style by Nidhubabu, the city?s so-called ?sophisticated? patrons of music reject kabigaan as a vulgar form of entertainment. Losing all his former patrons one by one, Kripa Sunri makes a desperate attempt to learn the new musical form. However, he soon realises that his efforts are in vain; the new cultural sensibility would always look down upon and exclude traditional performers and their forms of entertainment. Directed by Runu Chowdhury.

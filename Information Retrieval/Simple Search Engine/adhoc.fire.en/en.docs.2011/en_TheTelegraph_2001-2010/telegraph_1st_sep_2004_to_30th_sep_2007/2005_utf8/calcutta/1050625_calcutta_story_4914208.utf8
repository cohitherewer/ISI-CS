 Tsunami: Animal Instincts: Know more

 Join the big debate on Animal Planet on what is more effective in predicting natural disasters ? animal instincts or technology. Did the animals know that the tsunami was coming? How do animals react when a natural disaster strikes? For answers to these questions and more, tune in to the premiere programme Tsunami: Animal Instincts, which features an Animal Planet team investigating animal behaviour before, during and after the tsunami disaster. 

 Featuring compelling videos and engrossing stories, interviews with scientists and conservationists, eyewitness accounts, original footage from the tsunami-struck countries and archival footage from the channel, Tsunami: Animal Instincts tells the story of how different species sounded the alarm much before the killer waves struck. The programme features astonishing survival stories, like the divers in Thailand who were guided to safety by dolphins. 

 As Raja Balasubramanian, brand director of Discovery Networks India, puts it: ?It turns out that technology may not be a match for animal instincts. They proved to be far more effective than any man-made warning system.?

 So, catch the action on Animal Planet on Monday at 11 pm.

 After the B amp; B rap, it?s time for the Big B to singalong again. He?s no longer narrating the antics of Bunty and Babli, just asking people to aspire? for Rs 2 crore. Yes, that?s the new set of Kaun Banega Crorepati promos which feature Amitabh Bachchan rapping with three characters ? cricketer Vijay Nazare, musician Bijoy Lahiri and actor Vijay Kumar ? and announcing the return of the most watched game show on Indian telly on August 5.

 The spoof on the big names in the new commercial is an attempt to make the common man identify with the show and content, feels Ajay Vidyasagar, senior vice-president, marketing and communications, STAR Plus. A sequel to the Umeed promos which are all over the STAR airwaves, this Umeed Se Dugna campaign will premiere on STAR Plus at 8 pm on Sunday, during the screening of the IIFA awards.

 The red carpet arrivals at the Amsterdam Arena will be shown on Saturday and the awards night on Sunday. Catch Shah Rukh Khan compere the spectacular ceremony, with Karan Johar and Fardeen Khan.

 After the roaring success of Indian Idol, Sony Entertainment Televisions Fame Gurukul is being touted as the next big thing in reality shows. The final Fame Jodi might be yet undecided, but the 14 finalists have made a headstart with Aasman Ke Par, their first music album for Sony BMG Music Entertainment that was launched nationally on July 25. 

 Finalists Ruprekha Bannerjee and Arijit Singh were present at the Calcutta launch on Tuesday. 

 Produced by composer Miko, Aasman Ke Par pays tribute to the hard work, heart-warming moments and friendship of the contestants in their journey so far. Initially we all missed our family and friends, but gradually the Fame team became family, say both Ruprekha and Arijit.

 The album is a medley of Hindi numbers like Dola re dola, Yaaron sunlo zara, Yahan ke hum sikander and Chand taare. The lead song Aasman ke par is accompanied by a music video.

 We are all anxious and excited. We have worked very hard and tried to give our best shot, says the duo. 

 The album is a reflection of the aspirations of the students, says Sridhar Subramaniam, managing director, Sony BMG.

 When asked about life in Gurukul, both the participants recount the rigorous training and strict discipline. We are being groomed in all aspects of music, dance and performance. Apart from the faculty, celebrities like Rabbi, Vishal Shekhar, Alka Yagnik, Dia Mirza and Band of Boys shared useful tips. 

 Hailing from various parts of India, these youngsters have one thing in common: the zeal to make it big. We all have potentials, but it all depends on how we perform in the gala rounds, they smile together.

 Dream date

 If meeting your superstar seems a distant dream, and ways of contacting him just as slim, Rin Advanced has got just the thing for you.

 The HLL product launched an Amitabh Bachchan Graffiti board at Forum and City Centre on Tuesday, providing Calcuttans with a platform to write messages to the Big B.

 Sonali Bhattacharya of Kalighat won the Rin Advanced Meet and Greet promotional, part of the Safedi Ka Shahenshah campaign. Sonali will get the chance to meet the big man of Bollywood. Whats more, she will be carrying along with her a poster with messages from city fans. Through this campaign, people can also win guaranteed silver coins.

 Everyone has seen him on screen. I am so lucky that I have got the opportunity to meet him in person. More importantly, I will be carrying the messages of his Calcutta fans, gushed Sonali.

 Amitabh Bachchan is an icon and meeting him is the dream of countless people. We are happy to help people realise their dreams, said Nitin Paranjpe, vice president, Laundry and Household Cleaners.

 Old gold

 Waiting for a reason to get that gold jewellery out of the locker? Heres one.

 Tanishq has announced a jewellery exchange offer till August 7. Old gold of 19.9 carat would be valued at 22 carat and customers would then have todays trendy designs to choose from in exchange of yesterdays jewellery.

 The offer also allows an additional 20 per cent value for old gold jewellery exchanged for certified Tanishq diamonds. Most gold jewellery stashed away in bank lockers cannot be worn because of the designs, defects or size. The young generation often inherits gold jewellery that is out of fashion, observes Dwaipayan Sen, regional business manager at Tanishq. 

 This offer allows women to pick up jewellery that is in at much reduced rates.

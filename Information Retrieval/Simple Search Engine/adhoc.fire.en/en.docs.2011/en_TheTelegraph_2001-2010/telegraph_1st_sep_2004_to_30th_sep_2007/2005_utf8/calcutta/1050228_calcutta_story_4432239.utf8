 The Calcutta edition of the Seagram?s Blenders Pride Fashion Tour 2005 got off to a fun-filled start on Friday evening with a blink-and-you?ll-miss-it show featuring creations of Delhi-based designers Malini Ramani and Aparna Chandra. The much-awaited action on the ramp lasted all of 25 minutes, but while it did, it offered the audience glimpses of some of the trends likely to spin the style story of spring-summer ?05. The showcasing continued on Saturday night, when the near one-hour display of ensembles by design biggies Tarun Tahiliani and Wendell Rodricks made up for Friday?s rushed affair. 

 Liberal doses of white blending beautifully with vibrant and fluorescent hues as well as some earthy tones defined the colour code of the season, while lots of layering with flowing georgettes and chiffons made the style clear.

 The show on Friday, organised by Showhouse in association with The Oberoi Grand, started with Chandra?s collection of ?fun clothing?. The feminine, sensual line had accents of the 60s, emphasised by the make-up, hairstyles and accessories. Short dresses, flowing kaftans, bikini tops, skirts of various shapes and sizes in fluorescent tones of green, pink, yellow, blue and orange created the look.

 ?This is an essentially dress-up collection but with extremely free and comfortable silhouettes. It?s very glamourous and sexy and I have had a lot of fun designing it,? smiled Chandra.

 Minimal embellishments with floral motifs and solid colours were in total contrast with the next collection that rolled on to the ramp ? Ramani?s line of resort wear called Tropical Disco of Love. Oodles of shine, shimmer and sparkle combined with a riot of prints dominated the range of ?island wear?. A kaleidoscope of floral prints on western silhouettes was combined with Indian elements like mirror work and embroidery. The colours ranged from white and beige to yellow, green, blue and aqua.

 ?My spring-summer collection is all about island life. I have designed a wardrobe for an enchanting holiday in the tropics using bold prints and lots of brilliant colours,? explained Ramani.

 If Friday night ended on a colourful note, Saturday evening kicked off with pristine white and ivory. The show started with Tahiliani?s line of elegant ensembles including kaftans, kimonos, corsets, dresses, tops, trousers, skirts and overcoats in flowing fabrics and lace, set off by pearls. Colours started creeping in gradually, first in the form of embellishments, and then moving on to the prints and the base.

 Modern silhouettes highlighting the feminine form with lots of layering defined the style. Tahiliani?s trademark chikan work adorned some of the garments, while semi-precious stones formed the trimmings on others. The ?pale bright? palette included beige, coral, jade and blue, with white playing the most important role.

 The man known to dabble most with white, however, shunned the colour almost totally in his women?s wear collection. Rodricks? presented his line of resort wear called Ripple in a unique murky brown, combined with glimpses of aquamarine, blue and red. ?I used two shades of brown ? murky and muddy ? and some blue, aqua and red to make it bright. Brown in itself is not meant for Indian skin tones at all. So I have used the blues and reds to make brown look bright. It is a very unusual colour for spring and summer, but I was just not in a mood to work with bright shades,? said Rodricks.

 The ?ripple? effect flowed throughout the collection, with crinkled fabrics treated to form soft waves, which combined with gleaming satin and sheer organza. Like Chandra?s collection, prints and embellishments were totally absent here too, with solid colours and neat cuts presenting a minimalist look. A few men?s outfits in white punctuated the display of the women?s wear line.

 The models who paraded on the ramp last weekend included some of the top names from the country?s glam circuit ? Nayanika Chatterjee Singh, Jesse Randhawa, Fleur Xavier, Vidisha Pavate, Candice Pinto, Nina Manuel, Tupur Chatterjee, Dipannita Sharma, Carol Gracious and Sharan Mishra among others. They shared the platform with some of our city catwalkers like Sanjukta, Amrita, Devdutta and Jessica. Current modelling heartthrob Upen Patel stole the limelight among the men, sharing the stage with Neeraj Saluja.

 Ray Charles: On celluloid

 l One man made music that soothed restless souls. Another wrote stories that freed the mind to dream. The third was a flamboyant business tycoon, high flyer and Hollywood film-maker. 

 Ray Charles, James Mathew Barrie, Howard Hughes ? three men of substance who lived colourful lives and left legacies that loom large in public life, even in death. Their lives portrayed on screen are three of the five films vying for the best picture Oscar this time.

 Biographies have long been a favourite in tinsel town, possessing a quality other films never will ? the edge of truth and a glimpse into the private life of a public persona. 

 Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet: Two is company

 Ben Kingsley recently declared that Gandhi was not one of his best performances, yet it won him an Oscar and endeared him to audiences worldwide.

 Cate Blanchett received an Academy Award nomination in her role as Elizabeth. Liam Neeson played Michael Collins, the Irish hero in Michael Collins and Oscar Schindler in Schindler?s List. Frida saw Salma Hayek toning down her glam quotient and doing a role reversal to play firebrand Mexican painter Frida Kahlo, a political, artistic and sexual revolutionary, albeit crippled by health problems. 

 Nicole Kidman was Virginia Woolf in The Hours, changing more than just the look of her nose to bring to life the famous author. Kate Winslet and Dame Judi Dench teamed up to play British novelist Iris Murdoch in the film Iris, evoking a moving image of her transition from a young girl in love and full of life to an old woman suffering from Alzheimer?s disease. 

 Jude Law and Cate Blanchett as Eroll Flynn 

and Katherine Hepburn in The Aviator: 

 Madonna was just one of the Evita actresses bringing alive the enigma of Eva Peron. 

 A Beautiful Mind took home the golden statuette with Russell Crowe?s portrayal of Nobel Prize-winning mathematician John Nash Jr., who suffered from schizophrenia most of his life. Crowe then became Captain Jack Aubrey in Master and Commander.

 Portraying a real person is perhaps tougher than bringing to life a fictional character, however life-like. For, in the case of famous personalities, their every move is closely and publicly followed, and fans can be hard to please, even if the discrepancies are minor. But people?s everlasting curiosity about how their heroes ? or villains like Adolf Hitler and prostitute-turned-serial killer Aileen Wuornos (Monster) ? lived or died, makes this genre of film-making an integral part of the movie industry.

 Moment from Finding Neverland: Touching

 This year?s Oscar has five biographies in its nominations list. Ray, with Jamie Foxx starring as singer Ray Charles. Finding Neverland follows J.M. Barrie?s friendship with five boys, the inspiration for his book Peter Pan. The Aviator focuses on Howard Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio) at his peak, when he was an aviation and Hollywood success. All three films also earned the leading men best actor nominations, testifying to the power that legends and their lives have on audiences.

 The Motorcycle Diaries is based on the diaries of Ernesto Guevara when he went on a trip across South America with a friend, something that changed his life and made him the communist revolutionary Che Guevara. Kinsey (Liam Neeson once again steps into real-life shoes), is based on the life of Alfred Kinsey, a pioneer in human sexuality research, revealing the pitfalls of being a leader in social thinking.

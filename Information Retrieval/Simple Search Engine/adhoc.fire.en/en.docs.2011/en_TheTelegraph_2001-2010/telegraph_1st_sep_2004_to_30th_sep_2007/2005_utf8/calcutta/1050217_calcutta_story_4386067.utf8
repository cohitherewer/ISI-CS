The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 I work better with women directors: Zayed

at a press conference, and in a moment from Shabd 

 He is becoming the third angle of Bollywood. After starting off as the regular dance-around-the-trees hero, ZAYED KHAN has played the ?man outside marriage? in two back-to-back films, Vaada and Shabd. The son of yesteryear actor Sanjay Khan spoke to Pratim D. Gupta about his new-found identity and his future in tinsel town.

 After Shah Rukh Khan, it?s Sanjay Dutt and Aishwarya 

Rai. Your co-actors are getting as big as they get...

 Yes, I have been lucky. More importantly, in Shabd both Sanju and Ash have been more than gracious to accommodate my inexperience. That only talks about the film industry on the whole. 

 I have received a lot of assistance from both of them. I have known Sanju from the time I was a kid. As for Ash, I met her for the first time on the sets of Shabd and she is very grounded.

 How did you grab the role in Shabd?

 The film?s producer Rangita Pritish Nandy was looking for a fresh face for the film. She saw me perform at a film awards ceremony and got in touch. The film?s director Leena Yadav sat with me for the script-reading and after two hours of narration, I said yes straightaway.

 How would you define your character in the film?

 I play Yash, a man who is the very manifestation of love. He is very happy-go-lucky and loves everybody unconditionally. He is like a breath of fresh air, a very fun-loving character. He?s very giving, almost selfless?

 That sounds very author-backed?

 Yash became an author-backed character when the makers met me. They went on to infuse a lot of character traits of mine into Yash. Leena had a huge role in bringing out the character in me. Yash?s more like a child in a grown-up?s world but he is grown-up when it comes to the crux of the matter.

 So it?s a white character, compared to your black 

self in Vaada?

 Yes, it is a completely white character. And I am really happy that it is coming after Vaada. I want to excite the audience with my roles. It?s no use trying to do something different all the time. You have to select the right script. The script must be the hero. You have to like the character you play. I am very happy with the response I have got for Vaada. It was above my expectations. Shabd has also taken off well.

 How was it working with another debutante woman 

director, Leena Yadav?

 Of course, I have worked before with Farah (Khan) who is a woman and was a debutante while making Main Hoon Na. I find no difference in gender. Whether the director is a woman or a man is a sheer coincidence. But, yes I believe I work better with women.

 Wasn?t it awkward doing those intimate scenes 

with Aishwarya?

 What?s so difficult or awkward about it? Any man will be smitten by her. She is so beautiful and electrifying. And it?s just a plot in the film. I am being told to do something as a character. 

 Also, all the sensuality shown in the film has been shot very aesthetically and beautifully.

 Are you happy with the way Shabd has shaped 

up?

 I have watched the film three times and am proud to be a part of the project. The film is light-years ahead of its time. It?s a cult movie to me ? the perfect fusion of technology and old-school classic way of shooting. 

 The special effects used in the film has been done very subtly. The beauty of the special effects is that it looks as close to reality as possible. The cinematography too is of extremely high quality.

 What are your forthcoming films?

 There?s Sohail Khan?s Fight Club alongside Dia Mirza and Amrita Arora. Anubhav Sinha?s Dus has almost half the film industry in it. Then there?s David Dhawan?s Shaadi No. 1 with Soha Ali Khan and other actors.

 Lots of multi-starrers there. Doesn?t that mean 

sharing screen space and time with other heroes?

 I don?t think doing multi-starrers is a problem. I would like to watch myself in films that I would myself enjoy watching. I don?t want to indulge in a pseudo intellectual pursuit of a good script which has only me as the hero. The right time and place for that will come.

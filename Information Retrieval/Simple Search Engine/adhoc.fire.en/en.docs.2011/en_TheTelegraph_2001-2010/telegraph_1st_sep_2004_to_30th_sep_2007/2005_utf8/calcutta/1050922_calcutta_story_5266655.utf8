 Naveen Andrews in Lost

 The show was in the spotlight at the Emmy Awards this year. Lost debuted in India on STAR Movies on September 3. Since then, the American programme about a motley group stranded on a deserted island has gripped audiences. One of the stars of the show is British-Indian Naveen Andrews.

 After having done films like The English Patient and Bride amp; Prejudice, the move to the small screen was not out of love for the telly. The Kamasutra man took the job because the character of Sayid, a member of the Iraqi Republican Guard, ?intrigued? him.

 The actors in Lost are kept in the dark about much of the storyline, to make the suspense more real. Andrews says he now prefers not to know, to keep the surprise element real. ?At first, it was scary. It was frightening to be literally shooting in the dark. You do, obviously, make some wrong choices that would show, but I think it?s pretty good not knowing? 

 ?If there?s one thing I?ve learned, it?s that the show?s completely unpredictable. But I sense something sort of spiritual about the character I play. Maybe something that goes in that direction in the future maybe good.? 

 The father of a 12-year-old boy doesn?t take too much notice of what others are saying about him or his character, although the critics have been raving about the show and message boards on the Net have been humming about Andrews? sex appeal and Sayid?s story. It ?detracts? from the work, says he. 

 The LA-based actor is not a fan of TV ? ?television is there to keep people drugged, like heroin, to stop people from thinking?. But he?s happy Lost is a hit ? ?the highest compliment I?ve ever received is when people have come up to me and said, ?I don?t watch TV, but I watch your show?.?

 The former wild child ? ?I used to drink a lot and do a lot of drugs? ? has mended his ways somewhat. Being in Hawaii, where the series is shot, away from the craziness of LA, has helped. And although he?s still a smoker, shifting to addictions like shopping has eased the clean-up. 

 Andrews admits to being happier now. In fact, drawing from his own life, he added a romantic angle to his character by getting involved with a ?white woman? ? Andrews is in a relationship with actress Barbara Hershey.

 Andrews says he was aware of the ?huge responsibility? of the negative Hollywood stereotype. ?Even though Sayid is an Iraqi, and has tortured people, this is a time of war when people are trying to connect with the so-called enemy in a way that the government and media aren?t allowing them to do,? adds the Englishman with ?strong Indian roots?.

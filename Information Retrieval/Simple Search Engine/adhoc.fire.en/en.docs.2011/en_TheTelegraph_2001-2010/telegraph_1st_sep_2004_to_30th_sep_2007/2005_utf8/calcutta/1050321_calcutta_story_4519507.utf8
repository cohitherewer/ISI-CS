The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 What We are Watching

Bollywood

Karam

 Music video master Sanjay F. Gupta tries to do a Desperado. John Abraham may be our answer to Antonio Banderas and Priyanka Chopra our Salma Hayek, but with no script in place, the film goes boom despite all the dhoom. The story of a contract killer trying to go straight is as hackneyed as it gets and the black-and-white and sepia images can?t help the sagging content of the film.

 Catch it at INOX (Forum): 1.25 pm, 5.45 pm, 10.30 pm; INOX (City Centre): 12.40 pm, 3.05 pm, 10.25 pm; 89 Cinemas: 4.10 pm, 6.35 pm, 9 pm

 Flop factor The first week collections is around 50 per cent at the multiplexes.

Socha Na Tha

 The start was good for this fresh love story but the film couldn?t sustain its initial success. Debutant Abhay Deol is a mixed bag but doesn?t have the looks of his illustrious cousins. His on-screen love interest Ayesha Takia is good but not good enough to carry the film on her slim shoulders.

 Catch it at INOX (Forum): 1.30 pm, 7.15 pm; INOX (City Centre): 12.15 pm, 5.30 pm, 7.40 pm; 89 Cinemas: 11.10 am, 3.35 pm, 6.20 pm

 Flop factor The third-week collections of the Imtiaz Ali film is around the 50 per cent mark.

Black

 Redefining Indian cinema in more ways than one, the Sanjay Leela Bhansali classic has had a huge impact nationwide, especially in the metros. Positive word-of-mouth publicity and brilliant performances by Rani Mukherjee and Amitabh Bachchan have got more and more audiences to the theatres.

 Catch it at INOX (Forum): 1.20 pm, 3.45 pm, 5.25 pm, 8 pm; INOX (City Centre): 10.25 am, 2.55 pm, 5.25 pm, 7.55 pm; 89 Cinemas: 12.10 pm, 4.25 pm, 6.50 pm, 9.15 pm

 Success story In its sixth week at the box-office, Black still commands more than 70 per cent audiences at the multiplexes.

Bewafaa

 Dharmesh Darshan targets the family audiences with this out-and-out tearjerker. Anil Kapoor has his hands inside his pockets, Kareena finds herself in the bathtub, Akshay with weird facial hair ? it?s a masala mess and after the initial star pull, it?s been all downhill for Bewafaa. 

 Catch it at INOX (Forum): 4.15 pm, 10 pm; INOX (City Centre): 12 noon, 5.15 pm, 10.10 pm; 89 Cinemas: 2.35 pm, 5.40 pm, 9.05 pm

 Flop factor Just a couple of weeks old, the film has been able to barely touch the 50 per cent mark at the cineplexes.

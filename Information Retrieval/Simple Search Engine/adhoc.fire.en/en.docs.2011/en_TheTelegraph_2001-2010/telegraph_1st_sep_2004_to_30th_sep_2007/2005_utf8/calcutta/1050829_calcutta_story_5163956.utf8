 Second stop for luxury label 

 LIFESTYLE ZONE 

 ANUMITA GHOSH

 Its among the oldest designer labels of the country and remains synonymous with sheer class. After the legendary Satya Paul, the brand has reached new heights under son Puneet Nanda and it is the first designer label in India to operate within a fully corporate structure.

 The house of Satya Paul has recently gifted Calcutta a plush boutique store, housed at 37, Shakespeare Sarani.

 This is the second from the Satya Paul stable in the city, the first one being in Forum, on Elgin Road.

 This one is a boutique store, unlike the Forum one. It offers only our very high-end collections and each piece here is a collectors item, says Madhusudan Binani, proprietor of the store.

 The outlet at Forum has space constraints, while this one is roomy enough for customers to come in and spend some time as they look around. We promise personalised care to each guest who walks in, he adds.

 The store right now showcases a melange of exclusive saris, kurtis, ponchos, unstitched material, scarves and stoles.

 A pret line designed using latest technology and digital prints is in the pipeline.

 Signature style 

 The show stealers are the elegant, sartorial drapes in crepes, georgettes and chiffons, bearing the signature Satya Paul designs.

 Each collection comprises around 18 designs and an inexhaustible range of colour schemes, striking contrasts and bold designs.

 A hotseller right now is a line of saris in vibrant combinations of blue-green and violet-blue.

 And then theres the Aqua collection drawing inspiration ? somewhat unfortunately ? from the tsunami waves. This is a medley of waves, foams and furls in sheer whites, greens and blues.

 The animal print saris launched by the label last year also occupy rack space. Leopard and zebra prints mostly in red, black, white and browns comprise this line.

 The other highlights in the sari section ? the Bindu sari with body stripes and a single huge polka dot in the pallu, saris adorned by Chinese calligraphy, brush prints, red chillies and polkas, the Techno Linear collection, and saris inspired by the Evil Eye ? are sure to draw attention and inspire spending.

 The saris also draw inspiration from master artists like Matisse, Klimt and Rothko, says a spokesperson for the Shakespeare Sarani store.

 Ethnic elegance

 The salwar suits are an assortment of fabrics like linen, cotton, crepe and georgette. The colour palette is extensive, ranging from bright reds, oranges and yellows to blacks and sober pastels. Embellishments include prints, thread-work, patchwork, Swarovski crystals and beads.

 While the screen-printed ones teamed with sequins throw up suitable buys for occasion wear, the ones with intricate thread work are just right for formal wear. A line of salwar suits with Brahma-Vishnu prints catches the eye.

 While the kameezes come in myriad designs, there are ample options in the lowers as well. Apart from the usual churidar and salwar, there is the kurta teamed with parallels as well.

 There is also an extensive range of unstitched material in retro and abstract designs. While floral patterns on white bases could serve as day wear, the more glamorous ones come with heavy embellishments on bright splashes.

 The salwar suits start at Rs 1,695.

 Global silhouettes

 The store also boasts a limited collection of kurtis, ponchos, formal tops and asymmetrical skirts, designed in keeping with international trends. Simple necklines, many shades and interesting prints and motifs define the kurtis that come in crepes, georgettes, cotton and linen. 

 The highlights of the line are the Pullock prints, zardosi work, sequins and shell work. The price tags start from Rs 1,995. Printed stoles and scarves in crepes, georgettes and satins, bearing the trademark Satya Paul prints, come for anything above Rs 545.

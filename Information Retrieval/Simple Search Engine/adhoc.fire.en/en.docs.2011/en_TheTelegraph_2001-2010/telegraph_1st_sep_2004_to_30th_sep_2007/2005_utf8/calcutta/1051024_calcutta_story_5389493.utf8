 - Hospitals lay out slew of sops to boost patient morale

 No more waiting in the lobby for the arduous admission procedure; the receptionist will fill the lengthy form for you. No more eating cold and stale breakfast; bread will be toasted in front of you and served warm. For a break from the boredom, you will have the option of picking up a John Grisham or Sidney Sheldon title from a mobile library.

 With an eye on the proposed multi-crore health city project, most hospitals belonging to the Association of Hospitals of Eastern India (AHEI) have set upon a mission to try out novel concepts for upgrading patient care and efficiency.

 Taking the lead is AMRI Hospitals, which has introduced a string of measures to improve patient care. ?We have started with breakfast. To end complaints of bad or stale food, we will toast bread in front of patients. All food will be served warm. It?s a psychological ploy to boost patients? morale,? explains AMRI president S.B. Purakayastha.

 The hospital has also started a mobile library, from where a patient can borrow a copy of his favourite novel. ?We also supply newspapers and magazines to patients, but the mobile library is a big hit,? says Purakayastha. 

 To improve efficiency, AMRI has introduced a fully mechanised kitchen. ?Keeping in mind the foreign clientele we are likely to serve in the near future, we are also training our front desk staff to converse in good English and handle patients and their relatives,? Purakayastha tells Metro.

 Boosting efficiency is the latest buzz in Ruby General Hospital, too. It has introduced a system to speed up work.

 ?We have installed a rail channel on the ceiling, where all blood samples for test are placed in a canister, which automatically reaches the pathology department. This has minimised delay,? says Ruby managing director and AHEI president Sajal Dutta.

 The hospital has adopted a ?six-sigma? formula, introduced by Motorola, to decrease deficiency and increase efficiency. ?For instance, the sigma team found out that we were losing 30 per cent patients because of poor follow-up, either on the front desk or in the outpatients department. The team worked out remedial measures and we are seeing a change,? Dutta explains.

 The hospital has also devoted an entire floor to Internet facilities, personal kitchenette, library and a movie corner. ?Patients can have a small party there,? he adds.

 Apollo Gleneagles has decided to introduce celebration lunches or dinners for couples before they leave the hospital. ?Birth of a baby is always a happy event and hosting a dinner or gifting a cake is what we can do to celebrate it,? says Srilata Reddy, head of food and beverages and housekeeping. The hospital is also organising birthday bashes with balloons, cakes and candles.

 Making things simple is the motto at Calcutta Medical Research Institute, where receptionists escort patients to their rooms. ?We also see to it that a patient?s relatives do not go through the rigour of filling up the admission form. That?s done by our staff and all a patient has to do is sign the form,? says chief executive officer Amit De.

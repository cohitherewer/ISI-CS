 Charges traded in hospital death

 - Patient dies at night, private attendant missing

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The relatives of a 55-year-old woman on Wednesday held the authorities of Calcutta Medical College entirely responsible for her death. 

 The hospital authorities, however, tried to pass on the blame to relatives, who had hired a private attendant for the patient, which is illegal, 

 Shibani Sarkar, according to hospital sources, was admitted with a pain in her appendix in the casualty bloc of the hospital, in bed number B-10. On Tuesday night, her condition suddenly deteriorated and she died on Wednesday. 

 When Sarkar?s relatives arrived on Wednesday morning, they found her dead. Patients in adjoining beds said late on Tuesday night, when Shibani cried in pain, her attendant did not turn up. 

 Towards the morning, when she slumped, a house staff rushed to her and soon, thereafter, she died.

 Shibani?s death, hospital insiders said, was a pointer to a problem the state government has been trying to resolve for one-and-a-half years. 

 After a series of slip-ups leading to deaths in government hospitals, the state health department decided to stop the practice of hiring private attendants for patients. 

 A series of protests ensued, but the state maintained that with only nurses around, it would be easier to fix responsibility.

 ?It was then decided that only relatives of patients will be allowed to stay at night,? said a senior health officer. 

 The hospital superintendent shrugged off responsibility for Wednesday?s death. 

 ?The relatives complained about the negligence of private attendants. The hospital obviously has no role in this. We have asked patients not to hire them,? said superintendent Rabindranath Chattopadhayay. 

 The relatives, conceding that the private attendant was negligent, said Shibani once fell from the hospital bed, and added that the hospital could have attended to her problem in advance so that she could be released. 

 ?No doctor was available at night to come to her help. Much later, when one of the house staff rushed to her, things had already gone out of hand,? said one of Shibani?s relatives.

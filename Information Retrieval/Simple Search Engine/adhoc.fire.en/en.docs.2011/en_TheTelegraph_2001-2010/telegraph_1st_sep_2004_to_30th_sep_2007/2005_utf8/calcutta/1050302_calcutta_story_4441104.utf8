The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Beam battle in suit route

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The beam battle on local turf could now be settled in a courtroom of the capital. 

 The STAR and Sony beam block on the SitiCable unit of Calcutta Communications that found its way to Delhi?s Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) on Saturday, moved to Delhi High Court on Tuesday.

 STAR and Sony had switched off signals on Calcutta Communications, which services nearly 2.5 lakh cable households in various city pockets, on charges of piracy. 

 They had alleged that the company provides unauthorised feed to over 25 cable operators and some hotels.

 On a petition filed by Calcutta Communications, TDSAT had ordered Indian Cable Net, the city distributors for STAR and Sony, to restore signal to Calcutta Communications.

 Justice D.P. Wadhwa of TDSAT observed on Monday: ?Cutting off signals after giving two days? notice gives rise to serious consequences for the consumers. No multi-system operator (MSO) or broadcaster can give two days? notice without any particulars and then sit back and leave the subscribers in the lurch.?

 He directed the broadcasters and their distributor to restore beam before 9 pm on Monday.

 On Tuesday, however, Indian Cable Net decided to contest the TDSAT order in Delhi High Court. ?We sent the matter to our legal department and are acting according to its advice,? said a spokesperson for the company.

 ?Whatever is happening is the result of an MSO turning distributor and using it to take unfair advantage,? alleged a spokesperson for SitiCable.

 As a result of the switch-off on Saturday evening, viewers missed out on the Oscars, along with some of their other favourite programmes on channels like STAR Plus, Sony Entertainment Television (which airs Indian Idol) and Discovery. 

 The news channels in the two bouquets, including STAR News, have, however, remained on view.

 80 hurt in power fight

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Bidyut Bhavan, head office of the State Electricity Board (SEB), at Karunamoyee, in Salt Lake, turned into a battlefield on Thursday afternoon as supporters of SUCI-backed All-Bengal Electricity Consumers Association clashed with police.

 Cops fired two rounds of teargas and resorted to a lathicharge to disperse the demonstrators. Nearly 80 people, including 30 policemen, were injured in the melee, and 60 were arrested.

 ?A mob of 2,000 association supporters assembled in front of Bidyut Bhavan around 2.30 pm. The demonstrators wanted to submit a deputation to senior SEB officials. They suddenly turned violent and began ransacking the building?s security office,? said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas.

 The CPM justified the police action at Bidyut Bhavan. 

 ?We will not tolerate any attempt to create chaos at government offices and the administration took the right decision by dispersing the group that had gathered there and tried to enter the premises forcibly,? CPM state secretary Anil Biswas said.

 He made it clear that any move to disrupt functioning of government offices in future would be handled in a similar manner. 

 Trouble began when association members assembled at the gate of the building, protesting electricity price hike and curtailment of subsidy. Suddenly, some demonstrators attacked the security officers of the building in a bid to force their way in.

 Police were alerted and a large team led by the sub-divisional police officer of Salt Lake arrived. 

 ?As soon as police arrived, they began to beat up our members waiting outside the gate. Nearly 40 activists suffered injuries. The condition of five is serious and they have been admitted to RG Kar Hospital. One activist?s leg will have to be amputated below the knee,? said Sanjit Biswas, association general secretary. 

 Police denied Sanjit Biswas?s claim that two rounds had been fired on the protesters.

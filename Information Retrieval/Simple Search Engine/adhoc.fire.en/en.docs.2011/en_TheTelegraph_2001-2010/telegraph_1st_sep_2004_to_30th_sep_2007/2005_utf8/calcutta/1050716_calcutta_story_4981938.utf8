The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Most private buses in the city have leaking roofs and broken windows. During monsoon, the rainwater seeps down and wets the seats. In case the seats do not have rexine covers, the foam gets wet and takes a few days to dry. Some of the windows are stuck and cannot be closed. I wonder how the transport authorities at Beltala allow such buses to ply. The bus owners? associations should see to it that these basic comforts are provided to passengers.

 I went to watch a movie on Netaji at Nandan a month ago. The show started at 1.45 pm and continued without recess till 5.20 pm. Halfway through the film, people started trickling out of the hall for refreshments or to the toilet. This continued till the end of the movie. It was annoying for the rest of the audience. But then, the authorities should have allowed at least one interval during the three-and-half hour movie.

 The intersections of Moti Sil Street with Lenin Sarani and with SN Banerjee Road are often left unmanned by policemen despite the heavy traffic. As a result, the flow slows down and adds to the snarls at Moulali and Esplanade. Accidents are also frequent on both the roads. The authorities should ensure round-the-clock vigil on such small but busy crossings.

 Every evening, at the Mullick Bazaar-Park Street crossing, a group of small children coerces and harasses people waiting for buses for alms. On a particular evening, while I was waiting for the bus on the spot, a few of the beggars approached me. When I refused them, a man in his thirties appeared on the scene and scolded them saying ?You people can?t even do business?. It?s really heart-rending to see children begging on the roads at the behest of unscrupulous masterminds, who push them into the trade. Apart from pestering people for alms, these children are also trained to snatch belongings. Child-abduction rackets might have a hand in this business. The authorities concerned should take steps to curb the crime.

 The seminar mentioned in ?Eve talk fails to pay off?, July 11, in this column was held at the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and not at Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry, as printed.

 Super-realistic art

 Among the pioneers who introduced surrealism into modern Indian art, Kartick Chandra Pyne is one who embraces the concept of reality as part of a collective whole. His artistic vision endorses the view that reality comprises elements of both the conscious and the sub-conscious worlds. The ongoing exhibition of his paintings reflects his interest in expressing both forms of reality in their clear, true and uninhibited colours. Not one to dogmatically adhere to surrealism alone, his visual language is found to be rational or irrational, depending upon whether his theme is bounded by the realms of conscious knowledge, or traverses the hidden, unfathomable depths of the mind, as in dreams. Pyne?s technical virtuosity allows him the luxury of experimenting with folk and classical styles, at the same time retaining his keen understanding and perception of ?super-reality?. However, his style predominantly resembles that of a graphic artist; with emphasis on colour and structure, design and detail, and immersed in a fairytale world whose fables are the artist?s commentary on our existence.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Green fight on home turf 

 The largest environmental organisation in the world has set up an office in the city and is reaching out to individuals for support, finds Kaushik Ghosh

 It has offices in 41 countries and 4.5 million members. Its four state-of-the-art laboratories in Europe analyse data from the remotest corners of the globe to gauge environmental disasters before they happen. Sadly, the activities of Greenpeace were rather limited in the eastern part of India. But no more. An office of the organisation is up and running on Panditiya Road, ready to take up cudgels for the environment. 

 Greenpeace, with headquarters in Amsterdam, started its long history of campaigns in 1971 by protesting underground nuclear tests by the US government in Alaska. Since then, it has engaged in ?non-violent creative confrontations? with people in power in all parts of the world over issues as diverse as harpooning of whales and logging of ancient forests.

 It also conducts scientific, economic and political research into causes and effects of environment pollution to come up with green-friendly ?alternatives that work?.

 Greenpeace started its activities in India in 1994 by taking up the cause of the victims of the Bhopal gas leak. But it registered as a society in 2001. Ten offices of the organisation have been set up in the country, Calcutta being the latest. One of the most unique aspects of Greenpeace is that it does not accept contributions from governments, corporations or political parties, as it feels that would compromise the organisation?s core values.

 City head Deb Kumar Chattopadhyay says: ?We are presently strengthening our base and raising funds, but that does not mean our primary work has taken a backseat. One of our four ships, Rainbow Warrior, surveyed the east coast in November last year and identified some toxic hotspots like the Sunderbans and Paradeep. Rishra, too, poses a grave toxic threat. We are currently pursuing 27 campaigns in the country. Once we are done with them, we will take up new issues.?

 The response from Calcutta has been extremely encouraging. ?Since setting up office here in March, we have enlisted the support of 600 people. We are focussing on youths as they are the future. Our staff are visiting schools and encouraging students to become environmentally aware and start eco-clubs.?

 Bodhisattva Gupta is one of the 23 people working for Greenpeace in Calcutta. He is set to become an electronics engineer in a couple of months but would rather make people aware of the dangers of e-waste than write software.

 As part of a Direct Dialogue programme, Bodhisattva, along with his colleagues, is out on the streets for eight hours every day, informing people of the problems plaguing the environment.

 What?s on your mind this week

 Dress distress

 The vice-chancellor of Mumbai University has found a unique way to minimise incidences of molestation and rape ? by imposing a dress code on college and university students. The diktat has run into a wall of public disapproval. Yet, it could have grave repercussions in the near future. Are we living in a free, democratic society or in some decrepit, orthodox state ruled by neo-fascist elements? Personal freedom in India has become a farce. We have to abide by nonsensical laws while windy rhetoric on reformation of society is thrown at us. I find no evidence to suggest that more clothes on women have an adverse effect on men?s libido. If that was true, surely burkha-clad women would have been the safest in the world. It is unfortunate that after so many years of Independence, some self-appointed guardians of our morality are forcing us to follow their diktat.

 Winsome ways

 Roger Federer has clinched the Wimbledon men?s singles title for the third time in a row. The way he has been playing for the past two years is quite amazing. He sweeps past opponents with great ease almost always. In recent times, he has lost only two matches in Grand Slams (the semifinals of the Australian Open and French Open). Though he still has to go a long way to go before he can be counted among the greatest, it can be said fairly safely that such talent has not been seen on the tennis court for quite some time. Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi are the only two names which come to mind who could have posed a challenge to the Swiss master.

 Unjust law

 The Imrana episode leaves a lot to be desired from the law. How could the law-framing authority ? in this case, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board ? force Imrana to leave her husband instead of punishing her father-in-law who raped her? Such dogmatic and despotic lawmakers need to undergo a crash course in basic human morality before they can pass judgment on such contentious issues.

 Puff peril

 The imposition of ban on on-screen smoking seems to be a step in the right direction. Majority of the people who are addicted to smoking is fully aware of its ill effects. The objective should be to remove the addiction from its very roots. The only way it can be done is by preventing youths from picking up the habit in the first place.

 According to Union health minister A. Ramadoss, about 52 per cent children take to smoking, influenced by films. However, merely removing scenes of smoking would not help much in cleansing the society of this deadly habit. The biggest influence in a child?s life is his or her parents and it is essential that they inspire their wards by themselves refraining from smoking. Children also can encourage their parents to give up smoking.

 Social cause 

 July 2, the White-Band Day, is an occasion when discrimination among social classes disappear. On the day, socially aware individuals wear a white band around the wrist to support poverty eradication. When science presents us with innovative ideas and technologies every minute, can?t all of us come together to eliminate poverty forever?

 The Diary

 Mere Survival

 Flowers wither, 

 Fragrance dies. 

 Pastels fade, 

 Days go by? 

 Memories forgotten, 

 Tears now dry. 

 Stars still twinkling 

 In the night sky? 

 Dreams realised, 

 Some wishes lost. 

 Laughter uncertain, 

 Life seems a burden. 

 Unanswered calls, 

 I howl, I cry. 

 Trapped voices, 

 Within them I die? 

 Barkha Sharda,

 Broken

 Why,

 Why wont you just take me away,

 Take me away from all this miserable heartache and pain.

 Take my soul and carry it away,

 To another place where I dont have to be seen.

 I wish that these thoughts that drag in my mind would some day just fade away...

 I hide my razors so no one sees.

 My legs have scars and burns that only my eyes can see.

 I won?t let them show, I wont let you see...

 I can?t sleep at night because of all the horrible memories.

 I toss and turn and weep at night... no one to hold me,

 I sit and pop my life away with every pill that I slowly swallow...

 It?s the only way I can sleep peacefully at night...

 I?m tired of trying to push on daily,

 I?m tired of smiling when my smiles are so weak.

 I laugh and I play but inside I?m broken.

 I only want to fade away.

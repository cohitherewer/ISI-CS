The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Pujas clean and caring

 Eight cars set off in search of pandals with the true spirit on Panchami morning. Metro tracked some of the vehicles on Day I, as the judging teams did the rounds for the contest with a difference

 Car 1 (North Calcutta)

 Drinking water for all, first-aid counters and help desks, eco-friendly materials used in the construction of pandals, community service activities like blood donation camps, HIV/AIDS and thalassaemia awareness stalls and distribution of clothes among the poor ? all this to celebrate the true spirit of the Pujas.

 The participating puja committees in the CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Pujas, presented in association with HCL Beanstalk, stressed on aspects not always given priority at big pujas organised by para committees. 

 Not always were they successful in all attempts, and sometimes they weren?t even aware of necessary safety precautions. But they were eager for tips on a variety of issues ? torches for emergency lighting, strategic placement of fire extinguishers, the right number of waste bins, and more.

 The rains have played spoilsport, delaying the work at the pandals and sometimes slowing down progress. Yet, they struggled on, sometimes working through the night, not just to decorate the pandal, but also to set up first-aid stands, help desks and even stalls where some community activity would be held during the Puja days, an area most of these pujas excelled in.

 The crowd control at Rabindra Kanan Sarbojanin is exceptional, with one entry, an exit route to the mela on the park grounds and another leading outside ? they could afford it with the ample space. At Hatibagan Sarbojanin, the wiring for the lighting is new, taped to pillars and posts, to keep it out of harm?s way, although the open wiring remains a threat.

 The money for the Nalin Sarkar Street Sarbojanin puja has been collected through chanda, but only from the willing, even if it was just Re 1 from a poor family. Involvement from the para is paramount. Jubak Brinda, although lacking in some respects, is unequivocal in its assertion that there would be no playing of loud music, owing to the hospital behind the pandal.

 If Beadon Street Sarbojanin has arranged for several fire extinguishers and some wheel chairs, then Darpanarayan Tagore Street Palli has used special fire-retardant solution.

 The highlight of the route is Maniktala Chaltabagan Lohapatty, the reigning Model Puja. It has maintained its standards, insuring the pandal, the stalls and even the neighbouring houses against hazards. The contact numbers for both the fire services department and the fire-retardant treatment agency are on display. The charity work agenda is packed in the run-up to the puja. The idol, gigantic and pleasing, is housed in a pandal of bamboo work.

 Another puja high on aesthetics and social awareness is Rammohan Sammilani on Rammohun Roy Road. It?s pouring by then but an electrician is at hand to show the meter box. Seven fire-extinguishers and sandbags are in store to be installed in the evening.

 Nabamilan in Beleghata, showcasing Abanindranath Tagore?s Khirer Putul, evokes mixed reactions. It disappoints by blocking the 20-ft road, but its crowd control measures are fine. Again, in putting up the barricade for disciplined passage they are digging up the newly-repaired road. But then an anti-dengue camp has just been conducted. As for any medical emergency during the festival, a tie-up has been arranged with a local clinic.

 The Bagbazar Palli Puja, held in a park, is dwindling in support. So the women have taken the field, even collecting subscriptions. The club members are into sports. That guides their round-the-year priorities. But they want to buy an ambulance if they lay their hands on some prize money. A rain-marred Panchami morning is too early to get drinking water or medical kit ready. 

 The same problem plagues Goabagan Sarbojanin. Weary after a whole-night musical programme, the organisers are fighting the slush in the park. Before the soiree, they had distributed blankets among the underprivileged. 

 The other two pujas covered were Chaltabagan Sarbojanin and Children?s Park in Taltala. While members of the former, with a jute pandal, were initially confused about the location of their electric mains, Taltala was in mourning for a neighbour and keeping the celebrations low-key.

 The sudden squalls may have washed out some pandal facades, wrecked decorations at most True Spirit pujas on the Behala route, but the zest for festivities, the social and environmental concern and the fellow-feeling are hard to wipe out.

 Eco-friendly material like jute, straw, cloth, cane, terracotta, sawdust and clay have been used in most pandals like Sammilita Joyrampur Sarbojanin, Behala Trishakti Sangha and Sabuj Sathi. 

 Organisers seemed clear about the need for fire prevention measures. Arcadia Sarbojanin Durga Puja Committee is lucky to have a tank close to its all-straw rendition of the moner pakhi theme. But they still had an array of fire extinguishers and buckets on standby. Waterlogged Adarsha Palli has spent Rs 6 lakh on an avant garde pandal, mostly made out of metal sheets and objects. It has good fire-fighting measures, first-aid and crowd management services in place, but lacks in the community care aspect.

 Nandana Yuba Sangha, for instance, has a pandal made entirely out of traditional mats from Midnapore. ?Today, plastic mats are capturing the market; this is our way of giving something back to these poor artisans,? says designer Joy Chandra Chandra.

 The organisers also have a wheel chair and inclined access for the old and disabled. Devdaru Phatak Sarbojanin has similarly decided to showcase the indigenous art and culture of the Santhals. There would be Santhal dances and at the end of the Puja, most items from the pandal would be auctioned and the proceeds handed over to the 20 Santhal craftsmen who have worked for them.

 Senhati Durga Puja Committee is putting up a brave fight against the slush over-running the large playground, but it displays great camaraderie with housewives and teenagers pitching in.

 Prasanta Disha Sarbojanin falls short on every True Spirit count, but then it has redeemed itself by pledging assistance to six needy school students from the Puja fund.

 From sponsoring the treatment of cancer patients to restoring an extended stretch of grass cover, some south Calcutta committees of CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja have really thought out of the box.

 With limited budgets but vision unlimited, the Puja preparations from Bhowanipore to Deshapriya Park, have taken a lot of care to ensure basic requisites like drinking water, fire-fighting equipment and first-aid centres.

 The 22 Palli Sarodotsav at Northern Park, now in its 61st year, is the clincher with the organisers actually using last year?s prize money to restore the grass cover of the park premises for this year?s Puja celebrations. What?s more, they have tied up with a nearby clinic for first-aid resources and plan to donate this year?s prize money ? if it comes their way, that is ? to aid a new wing of a neighbourhood hospital.

 The 75th-year celebrations of Bhowanipur Sarbojanin Durgotsav have started on a harmonious note with a special get-together for 75 orphans in the neighbourhood kickstarting the festivities on Friday evening. 

 The committee is also sponsoring the chemotherapy treatment of a cancer patient and the education of an underprivileged child in the neighbourhood. Special care has been taken for easy movement within the pandal for physically-challenged people in wheel chairs.

 At the 75 Palli Sarbojanin Durgotsav, into its 40th year, the preparations have not gone backstage because of the rain, which has been the case with most other Puja committees.

 Rather than hounding neighbourhood folks for contributions, the organisers here have gone for advertisement money to deck up their area in Bhowanipore.

 They have also been consistently using the excess money for blood donation camps, computer training classes and distributing blankets to the poor during the winter months.

 The use of tree barks inside the pandal, though, has been anything but eco-friendly.

 Small-budget pujas they may be, but from rendering support to artisans of Bengal to lending a hand to streetchildren, pujas down far south in Calcutta have it all. 

 The Golf Green Phase II, V and VI Sarodotsav Committee in its 24th year stands out for especially strong community participation and has a long list of social activities lined up over the three days that include felicitation of 70 elderly women from Nabanir, an old-age home, and arrangement for their puspanjali and refreshment on Ashtami, besides providing the Sabars (tribal artisans from Purulia) with stalls to showcase their art.

 Trikon Park in Santoshpur is all set to revive some traditional crafts of Bengal. So, their pandal has been created with jute mats, or madurs.

 The organisers are also donating money out of their Puja fund to help cancer and thalassaemia patients. At conch-blowing distance is the Avenue South Palli Mangal Samity puja, in its 39th year. This small eco-friendly puja stands out because of some excellent safety and first-aid arrangements, other than the pandal idol done in Bishnupuri style.

 To counter blaze bothers, provisions have been made with a host of fire-fighting equipment in place, which innovatively includes a number of showers on the roof of the neighbouring house to spray if required. 

 And their first-aid arrangement includes a bed and an oxygen cylinder to cope with any untoward incident.

 Travel further south, and a lovely homely puja, New Garia Abasik Sarodotsav, off EM Bypass unfolds. Surrounded by greenery and waterbodies on all sides, a unique thing about this puja in its 18th year is that it is being handled entirely by the women of the locality. And one is struck by the decorations and cleanliness of the place.

 Says Gopa Bagchi, secretary of the puja committee: ?It was kind of a challenge for us. All these years, it was the men who had been doing everything. But this time, we decided to take the plunge and show them that even we can. And our efforts are paying off. We have a whole lot of cultural events lined up and the entire community has come together for these three days.?

 Flyover trio on rent for billboards

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Flyovers that will be let out for billboards: 

 Park Street, Gariahat and AJC Bose

 Duration: 3 years

 Rent: Rs 3 crore

 Purpose: To raise funds for the upkeep of the structures

 HRBC will approve the billboards before they are put up

 The Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC), the implementing agency of the city flyovers, has rented out three high roads ? except the carriageways ? to advertising agencies, against a payment of Rs 3 crore.

 The rented-out space on the Gariahat, Park Street and AJC Bose Road flyovers include 100 pillars, front facade, girders, lamp posts and railings.

 The authorities were willing to let out the Lockgate Road flyover, too, but had to shelve the plan because of the poor response to the offer.

 ?We have let out the space on the three flyovers for three years for Rs 3 crore. The move is aimed at raising funds for the maintenance of the high roads,?? HRBC vice-chairman Sadhan Banerjee said on Wednesday.

 The agencies, however, will have to get the designs of the billboards approved by the HRBC before putting them up on the flyovers.

 ?We will not allow any odd-looking or steel structure. Besides, the billboards will have to be erected in such a way that they don?t block the carriageways or cause any distraction to motorists,? Banerjee explained.

 Officials elaborated that only glow signs would be allowed on the pillars and neon signboards on the guard-rails. The lamp posts have been reserved for small kiosks. 

 As for the maintenance of the flyovers, the officials said not much money would be required for the next few years ? except the electricity bills, which together amount to Rs 2 lakh to Rs 2.5 lakh per month ? as the structures have just been completed.

 Another reason for the maintenance cost being so low, they explained, is that the structures are all pre-fabricated. All it requires is painting the pillars and the guard-rails once a year.

 Which means a major part of the money to be collected from the advertising agencies can be spent on new projects.

 Even while the flyovers were being constructed, mayor Subrata Mukherjee had realised their potential for earning revenue. 

 He had argued with the transport department that the flyovers be handed over to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation as they had been built over roads maintained by the civic body.

 Mukherjee even spoke to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and offered to take all responsibilities for the upkeep of the flyovers. 

 But the chief minister rejected Mukherjee?s proposal and, instead, assigned the task to the HRBC.

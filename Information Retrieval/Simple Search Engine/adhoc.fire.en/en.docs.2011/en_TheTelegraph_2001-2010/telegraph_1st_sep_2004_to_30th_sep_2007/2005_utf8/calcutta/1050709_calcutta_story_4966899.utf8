The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Two weeks for pandal guidelines

 The high court on Friday ordered the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and police to frame guidelines on Durga puja pandals within two weeks. ?The CMC and police will have to ensure that the guidelines lessen the inconvenience of commuters, vehicles and the neighbourhood residents,? the division bench of Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice Ashok Ganguly ruled.

 ?We are giving you a week for this,? the judges told the lawyers representing the CMC and police. But as the respondents prayed for more time, the bench revised the deadline to two weeks.

 The order followed a public interest litigation by Tapan Kumar Mitra, a resident of Dover Lane, in south Calcutta, who sought the court?s intervention to prevent the inconvenience caused by pandals encroaching on busy thoroughfares. 

 Appearing for the civic body, Alok Ghosh submitted that his client had long ago formulated a set of rules relating to erection of pandals on roads. ?However, the organisers are allowed to set up pandals on roads if they obtain the necessary permission from police and the fire department.?

 This year, he told the court, the civic authorities will not let new organisers erect pandals encroaching on roads. ?As for the existing pujas, we will try to frame a fresh set of guidelines,? he said.

 Appearing for police, junior standing counsel Subrata Mukhopadhaya assured the bench that his client would extend all cooperation. 

 He submitted that police would ensure that the interests of the common people were not compromised with, though the primary duty of the force was to maintain law and order and that it was the civic body?s ?discretion to allow organisers to erect pandals on roads?.

 The petition was first moved on October 1, 2004 ? a few days ahead of the Pujas ? before a division bench presided over by then Chief Justice A.N. Roy. 

 Chief Justice Roy had appreciated petitioner Mitra?s move, saying that the problems mentioned by him were ?faced by thousands?.

 But as the festivities were round the corner, the bench did not entertain the petition, and instead, asked Mitra to move court afresh after the Pujas. 

 Accordingly, Mitra moved a petition early this year. It was admitted on Friday.

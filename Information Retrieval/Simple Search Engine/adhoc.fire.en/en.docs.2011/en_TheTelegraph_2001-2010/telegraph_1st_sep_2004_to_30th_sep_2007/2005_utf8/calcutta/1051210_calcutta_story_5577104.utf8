The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Trot and canter with wine and cheese

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Regulars and newcomers at the races looking for some clean fun will soon be spoilt for choice

 Wine-and-cheese sessions and sit-down dinners, open-air theatre and fashion shows, drive-in movies and live music. There?s a lot more you can do at the racecourse besides backing your favourite filly this winter.

 In a bid to alter the image of the sport and footfall profile at the racecourse, the Royal Calcutta Turf Club (RCTC) is rolling out a slew of eclectic add-ons. ?Unfortunately, the stigma of gambling has stuck to racing and we want to rid the magnificent sport of this,? stresses club steward Sujit Bhattacharyya.

 So, the turf club has lined up wraparound events on big race days, besides serving up live music and cuisine carousals on all weekends. The Calcutta 2000 Guineas this Saturday, the classic ?black-type? miler, is where the carnival kicks off.

 ?We have a corporate sponsor on board for this prestigious event after many years. This gives us resources plus a shot in the arm as we battle perception on racing,? observes J.N. Sapru, chairman of the think tank formed for a course correction and to develop the social club on the Russell Street campus.

 The 2000 Guineas will have a wine-tasting session in the members? enclosure, with a demo of grape-crushing and assorted vineyard vignettes. Fashion and music will keep the racing rendezvous rocking at night.

 The Queens Cup on February 4 ? which still follows the quaint custom of intimating Buckingham Palace about the winner through telegram, eliciting a congratulatory message in response ? is being billed as International Racing Day.

 ?We will ask the major consulate offices in Calcutta to present the prizes, like the America Cup or the Japan Cup. There will be food counters with cuisine from different parts of the world and an open-air continental dinner the night before,? declares Bhattacharyya.

 The RCTC authorities hope the carnival ambience would carry the sport?s appeal beyond just hard-core punters. So, the dazzling Queen?s Cup, handcrafted every year by Garrard, official jewellers to the Queen, will be on display, and a British theme will run through the day?s racing roster.

 ?Yes, the ultimate goal is bringing in the family crowds and we are looking at the possibility of cordoning off an area with no betting activity where parents can bring in the children. We are telling people to come to the course on a Saturday, have a beer or two, listen to some peppy music and generally have a great outing without the compulsion of betting,? says Sapru.

 RCTC, which hosted a gala dinner for the National Theatre Festival, is keen to connect with the city?s socio-cultural fabric. ?We hope to use the racecourse premises and the members? stand for music concerts, theatre with minimum props, art exhibitions and theme nights,? says secretary Boman Parakh.

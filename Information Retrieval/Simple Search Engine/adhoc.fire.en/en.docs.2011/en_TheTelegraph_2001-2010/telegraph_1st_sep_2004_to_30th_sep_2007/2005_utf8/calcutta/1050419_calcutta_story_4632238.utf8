 Aged prey of domestics

 - Cops see a pattern in servant attacks on elderly and alone

 A STAFF REPORTER

 They are aged and alone. And they are most vulnerable to the enemy within.

 The Mansarovar murder of Tara Chand Banka, 68, and wife Sarda is yet another chilling reminder of how easily the elderly can fall prey to domestics with criminal intent.

 If more than 10 per cent of the city?s total population is in the 65-plus age-group, police records abound in cases of this segment being targeted by domestics, for theft and worse.

 ?We are worried about attacks by domestics on aged couples. One must keep a record of the domestics with the local police station,? said Ranveer Kumar, deputy commissioner (headquarters).

 In August 2004, 71-year-old Lalita Devi Goenka was murdered and her apartment looted by her domestic help, Rabindra Nath Santra. He picked his moment, smashed the old woman?s head with a heavy object, slit her throat and then fled with the booty. Santra was arrested at Balasore, in Orissa, and confessed to his crime.

 City-based psychologists, studying cases of crime on geriatrics, feel the elderly often become ?too dependent on? and ?too friendly with? domestics. ?There is a pattern in almost all the cases where the older age-group has disclosed almost all their financial secrets to its servants. The servants then find it difficult to refrain from conspiring against their employers,? says psychologist Ranadip Ghosh Roy.

 ?We also come across cases where vulnerable aged couples have had a bad experience with a domestic and turn into nervous wrecks. They even undergo medication and often refuse to keep servants after that,? observes psychiatrist P. Pal.

 In a gruesome tale of a domestic help conspiring against aged employers, three women, aged between 65 and 72, were brutally murdered on College Street in the summer of 1995.

 In June 2002, Sushila Samsukha, in her late 60s, and her daughter Pragati were found murdered in their Deshapriya Park apartment. Investigations revealed their domestic help had passed on information to a distant relative, Chandan Bermucha, who had allegedly carried out the killing.

 In their effort to curb crime against the aged, the detective department of the city police and all the five divisional police departments have issued several instructions on how to handle domestic helps, but the crime graph keeps rising.

?This is a serious problem and we are strengthening 

our community policing efforts in our endeavour to curb such crimes,? said Anuj 

Sharma, deputy commissioner (south).

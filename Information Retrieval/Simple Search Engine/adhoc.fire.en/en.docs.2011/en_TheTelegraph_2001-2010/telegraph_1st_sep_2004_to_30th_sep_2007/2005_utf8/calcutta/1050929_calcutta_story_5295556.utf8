 As the city grooms for the festive season, Anjali Jewellers has gifted Calcutta an exclusive diamond showroom. 

 An extension of the existing flagship store, the showroom was inaugurated at Gol Park on September 26, by founders Ananya and Uttiya Choudhury.

 This exclusive diamond showroom will house a wide array of diamond and stone-studded jewellery, which carries the beauty and elegance, synonymous with the brand. 

 The rings, pendants, earrings, nose pins, bangles, bracelets and neckpieces on display strike a fine balance of the traditional and the contemporary.

 The diamond-studded pieces reflect skilled workmanship and a variety of designs. Apart from the normal round cuts, there are rose and princess cuts for the modern consumer.

 The most interesting part of this entire line of diamond jewellery is that the affordability factor has been kept in mind. Though there are some sets specially designed for the festive and the wedding seasons, most of the jewellery is dedicated to the shadharon meye (ordinary woman). 

 Gems for all

 Adding some more zing to the dazzling jewellery designs for the festivities is the exhibition by Art Karat. It is showcasing a sensuous collection by gemologist Asha Kamal Modi at Genesis Art Gallery. 

 Called Kamasutra, this elegant and seductive collection has jewellery for both women and men. In a rich array of semi-precious stones, the womens range comprises delicate hathphools, elaborate bracelets, dainty earrings, necklaces, anklets, payals and bichoovas, which are graceful belts and girdles encrusted with kundan work. 

 The line also has some exotic hair accessories, including beautifully enamelled and studded hair pins, combs, delicate stone-studded clips and skillfully crafted long serpent-like plaits that add to a womans elegance. Jewellery for men features sleek armlets and kundan-studded necklaces.

 The exhibition is on till October 1.

 Leather line

 Using leather garments and leather accessories during monsoons are a strict no-no. A splash of water and the soft surface gets fungal spots and wrinkles. 

 But this monsoon you can proudly flaunt your leather garments and bags purchased from Leather World, at 50B Shakespeare Sarani (beside Kala Mandir), and Metro Shopping Centre. 

 People hesitate to use leather items during the rains. But now with the new range of water-resistant leather products, it will be easier to sport these items. A coat of silicon over the leather surface prevents fungal spots and wrinkles, says Andaleeb Hashmi, owner of Leather World.

 Bags, overnighters, trolley and travel bags and leather garments come in hues of mauve, red, wine red, green and blue. The prices of the accessories range between Rs 400 and Rs 2,000; trolley and travel bags between Rs 800 and Rs 4,000 and leather garments between Rs 1,400 and Rs 6,000.

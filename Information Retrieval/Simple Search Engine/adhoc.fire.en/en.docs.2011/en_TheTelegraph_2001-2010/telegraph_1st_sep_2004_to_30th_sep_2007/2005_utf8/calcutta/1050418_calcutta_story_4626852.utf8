 Woman arrested for daughter suitor stab 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 When 20-year-old Dinesh Choudhuri first took out girlfriend Seema Ram on a date two years ago, little did he realise how sharply the girl?s parents would react. 

 And their reaction was not just restricted to disapproving of the match, as Dinesh learnt early on Sunday. Around 1.30 am, Seema?s mother pushed a dagger into him in front of his house in Kankinara, on the northern fringes of the city.

 Around 6.30 am, hours after the murder, bereaved members of Dinesh?s family torched the Rams? residence.

 Police arrived later and arrested Seema?s mother Purnima Ram on a charge of murder. They are on the lookout for her two sons, who were present at the crime scene.

 ?Purnima has been arrested. Her husband Madhusudan, along with Seema and sons Shankar and Shambhu, are absconding,? said Parveen Kumar, superintendent of North 24-Parganas police. ?We suspect they have fled to their village in Bihar.? 

 Additional superintendent of police (Barrackpore) Manoj Verma said the body, with the throat slit, had been found by a bush in the neighbourhood. Dinesh?s mother Rajkumari identified it, after which it was sent for post-mortem.

 Rajkumari told police Dinesh had been seeing Seema, 16, for the past two years. The two grew up in the same locality and knew each other since childhood. 

 Dinesh, a driver, had gone to Nepal for two months on an assignment. He returned on Saturday and the same afternoon, went to meet Seema at a spot near her house. The two did not notice that Seema?s brothers, who run a grocery in the area, were keeping a watch.

 ?Around 1.30 am, I was woken up by shouts in front of our house. Dinesh opened the door and saw Seema?s brothers and mother. He went out with them. That was the last time I saw him,? mother Rajkumari recalled.

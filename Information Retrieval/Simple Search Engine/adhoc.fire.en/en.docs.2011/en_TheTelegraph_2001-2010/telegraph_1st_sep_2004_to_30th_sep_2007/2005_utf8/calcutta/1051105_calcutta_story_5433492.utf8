 Whimsical,and yet most endearing

 SOUMITRA DAS

 One of Kishore Chatterjee?s works to be displayed next Friday

 Though Kishore Chatterjee is better known in Calcutta circles as a writer and a music and art critic, those who have known him closely are aware of his talents as a full-throated singer of Rabindrasangeet and a somewhat eccentric self-taught artist, whose abilities as a draughtsman and painter have developed over the years.

 In the autumn of his life, his talents are flowering and this becomes self-evident as the viewer takes in his series of drawings and paintings to be exhibited at Chitrakoot Gallery from November 11. These works were executed over a long period of time ? more than two decades in fact ? and they give a fairly good idea of Chatterjee?s growth as an artist.

 Chatterjee has been drawing male nudes quite unconventionally for some time. From initial hesitation his lines have become firm and sure as in the series of dancers. He has done a series resembling horizontal stained glass panels where the men are a row of luminous bodies. In the same vein he has painted a procession of monks glowing like tapers. Both works are marked by an economy of lines and colour ? a quality gained by constant practice.

 Also remarkable are his portraits of characters such as the ethereal Puck and Christ as a tortured figure bearing a burden of sorrows. In all these works he uses colours with great restraint. The visages of Christ titled Agonistes have the severity and stamp of deep sorrow of medieval wood carvings. Had he executed these earlier the images would have been more diffuse.

 In fact his lack of training seems to have stood him in good stead as he dares to experiment in a fashion that an established artist would have balked at.

 He has, for example, painted a head with large, rotund eyes and nose staring lugubriously at the viewer. Painted in indigo and brown it could have come out of the pages of a book of nonsense verse for which Bengali was famous.

 There are some very charming faces of little shepherd boys painted with bright hues. Perhaps there is something about their look, but in spite of their dissimilarity they would remind viewers of the works of Sunayani Debi, who happened to be Chatterjee?s grandmother.

 The most likeable quality of Chatterjee?s works is their whimsicality. Anybody who has entered his tiny studio stuffed with odds and ends and walls covered with paintings should know what an endearing quality it can be. There are several calligraphic works where this quality can be enjoyed more readily than in others. Doodles, splotches of paint and curly lines add up to fantasy figures and monstrous insects. At a time when artists are afraid of being individualists, Chatterjee can hold his own.

 Digitized imagery

 Photographs seize the very essence of a moment and capture it forever, preserving minute details like energy, emotion and state of dynamism of the subject. The advent of digital technology in photography has added a whole new dimension to it, bringing to life ideas and objects with precision and accuracy that were earlier difficult to obtain. The ongoing exhibition of digital images by Tushar Kanti Dutta, comprising 44 huge digital enlargements of the photographer?s specialised areas of interest, is a treat for the connoisseur of photography. The first fully digitized photographic exhibition in the city, it has on show a virtual retrospective of Dutta?s work spanning a period of 30 years. Divided into two categories, nature and pictorial, the photographs reveal the veteran lensman?s artistic obsession with conservation of environment and wildlife. Glimpses of his photographic excellence can be seen in rare snaps of endangered and extinct species of wild animals, insects and butterflies, like blue crane, leopard cat, squirrel monkey, giant tortoise, red-bodied swallow-tailed butterfly and the Aristrolocia plant.

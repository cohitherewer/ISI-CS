The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Sunit Singh

General manager, Paradise cinema

 In single-screen theatres, we can accommodate about 1,000 people. In a multiplex, on the other hand, the maximum capacity is around 380 per screen, though it is true that they simultaneously show a number of movies. In any case, the higher the multiplexes price themselves, the better it is for us. While our maximum price is Rs 75, in a multiplex the average price for the same movie is Rs 100. Everyone cannot afford to spend so much on a film. We cater to all sections of the audience. As for ambience, I would like to ask the multiplex crowd to see a film at Paradise, Priya or Menoka and tell the difference. Every six months we carry out fresh renovations. In some other halls, though, the ambience may be a problem. The government has given us the liberty to fix our own prices. For Veer-Zaara we pegged our highest ticket at Rs 125 and for Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham, it was Rs 150. But these were rare cases.

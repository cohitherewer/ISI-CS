 Mane mania

 Hair today, there tomorrow: Salman Khan 

 The shampoos and hair oil brands may have their designs on women, but its the men who seem more vexed with their fast-disappearing crowning glory. 

 Instead of spending all their time at hair spas or on fancy treatments, the appearance-conscious male population of Calcutta is fast turning to cosmetic surgery to make up for lost hair.

 Hair transplant, once thought to be the sole prerogative of film stars, is spreading itself thin ? or rather thick ? from software professionals to PR executives to sportsmen to school teachers to doctors.

 A large category comprises unmarried men struggling to find themselves a bride. A man in his 20s looks nearly 40 with a bald pate and in 97 per cent of these cases, baldness is a genetic factor, says city-based cosmetic surgeon Manoj Khanna who has performed around 700 surgeries since end-1996. 

 And only 55 of these have been on women patients.

 I do 10 to 15 transplants a month now, adds the doctor whose clinic on Loudon Street sees a steady stream of men aged between 20 and 65.

 There are also many from the modelling, showbiz and hospitality sectors, where looks are very important. Under the strong lights, thin hair becomes very visible, adds Khanna, who attributes the shift in his client profile to a change in attitude and a larger disposal income. 

 Earlier, there were lots of taboos regarding cosmetic surgery, but now people have the spending power and are also willing to spend.

 So the numbers preferring to wear a weave ? which causes sweating, irritation and infection on prolonged use ? are also going down by the day.

 Earlier, hair transplant used to look artificial. With the new follicular unique technique, it looks more natural. The surgery is conducted only on the scalp ? it has no connection with the brain ? for five to six hours and the patient can join work the next day, explains Khanna.

 The deal comes at Rs 50 per graft, with the final bill depending on the number of grafts one requires.

 Though his clients comprise many outstation and foreign patients, Khanna stresses how local clientele forms the bulk.

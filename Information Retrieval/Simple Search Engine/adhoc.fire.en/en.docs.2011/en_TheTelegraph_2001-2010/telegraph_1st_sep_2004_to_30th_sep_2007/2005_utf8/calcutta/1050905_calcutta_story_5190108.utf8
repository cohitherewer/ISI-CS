 My children Radhika and Rudraya, and their friend Mrinalini Dutta, had contacted 

the Compassionate Crusaders for the tubal ligation of a stray bitch of our locality. 

We all loved the animal. As we live in small flats, we needed an organisation 

that would take care of the dog during the post-operative period. We were willing 

to pay for the services. The staff members of Compassionate Crusaders took away 

the bitch on July 12, under case no. 303, assuring us that she would be returned 

in seven to 10 days. On July 21, Radhika was told over phone that it would take 

around five more days for the stitches to heal. However, on the 25th, we were 

very casually informed that the animal had died on the preceding Saturday. When 

I persisted the matter, I was told that she had died on July 19. How could the 

organisation not bother to inform us the very day the dog died?

 Our staff members had called up Dr Gupta?s the very day the animal died but 

he was not at home. A woman who attended the call was told to convey the message. 

Though complaints like this one are an exception, anybody who has specific grievances 

against our services may call at 22104365 and speak directly to our trustees. 

They can also write to them at Compassionate Crusaders, 15B, Clive Row, Calcutta-700001. 

The matter will be immediately followed up. We maintain separate case sheets for 

each animal here. Complainants can be shown the documents relating to the animal?s 

ailment, treatment, etc.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Track aid if power arrears cleared

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The state government on Thursday offered to help the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) repair damaged tram tracks if the civic body cleared outstanding dues amounting to Rs 177.29 crore to private power utility CESC.

 ?CMC has collected around Rs 150 crore from the waiver-of-interest scheme. It should use the money to clear its dues to the CESC. If it does so, we might extend financial help to the CMC in repairing tram tracks and carrying out other road maintenance work,? said municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya, after a meeting with mayor Subrata Mukherjee on Thursday afternoon. 

 This is the first time Bhattacharya has broken his silence on tram track repairs and his offer of help comes barely two months before the CMC elections. 

 According to the minister, the CMC owes Calcutta Metropolitan Water and Sanitation Authority Rs 382.76 crore and the West Bengal State Electricity Board Rs 66.52 crore, in addition to its dues to the CESC.

 Bhattacharya said that the civic body had raised Rs 28.90 crore as charges for the water it supplied last year, but it didn?t settle arrear bills with the state government or any other agency. 

 Mayor Mukherjee has written to the chief minister, raising several questions after Asok Bhattacharya asked the CMC to clear their dues.

 ?Our discussion today centred around the points the mayor had raised in his letter,? said the minister.

 When Mukherjee said that the CMC was not getting money from the state finance commission and the road tax on motor vehicles, Bhattacharya had reportedly pointed out that all municipalities were facing the same problem. 

 ?I have spoken to the finance minister regarding this,? the minister said.

 ?We did not allow a waiver scheme to any other municipality. We did this so that the CMC is able to clear its dues,? he added.

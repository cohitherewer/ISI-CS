The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Manning the party mantra

 They are the men who whip up midnight magic at every nightclub, while choosing to merge into the backdrop. 

 Zeeshan Jawed and Himika Chaudhuri hit the nightspots to meet the managers who make the city?s nightlife so happening.

Someplace Else

 Manager: Gautam Kumar Singh

 Age: 28

 Experience: This hotel management diploma-holder joined The Park group in 1996 and has since been around at this young and vibrant address. Having been deputy to the manager at the Mecca of live music, Gautam took over in December 2004. 

 USP: People?s person. This quiet man has a warm way of greeting his guests. Standing at the entrance or the floor of the pub, few guests can get in without a warm handshake from him. 

 The toughest ask: ?There is nothing difficult about my job. I enjoy every bit of it,? insists Gautam.

 Salaam Calcutta: ?Nine years ago when I started working, there were just a few faces that comprised the entire party circuit of the city. Today, new faces have been added. The mix of people is more diverse now ? you will find a salaried person rocking next to a business magnate. It?s become more casual. 

Bar H2O

 Manager: Siraj Mukherjee

 Age: 33

 Experience: This botany honours graduate from Calcutta University was forced to take up science because his parents refused to pay for his hotel management course unless he earned a degree in a ?proper? subject first. A graduate from IHM, Taratala, he joined the Oberoi group in 1995 and worked in F amp;B for four years. He shifted to The Park group as corporate trainer in 1999 and felt the urge to shift to operations in 2003. ?Our spa manager at The Park, Calcutta, had quit and I offered my services for the job besides continuing as a trainer. When this poolside bar and lounge opened in November, I took charge.? 

 USP: A multi-tasker. He has since managed to rock the place ? so what if running a nightspot was never on the job list before. 

 The toughest ask: ?Since I keep lecturing other employees during training sessions about doing a job well, it becomes even more important for me to live up to that standard.? 

 Salaam Calcutta: ?The party scene in Calcutta is really becoming better. The city is growing up in terms of nightlife. I think we have overtaken Delhi already, though Calcutta still has a long way to go when it comes to being educated about wines and cigars.? 

Winning Streak

 Manager: Probhashish Sanyal

 Age: 33

 Experience: He joined Someplace Else in 1994 and continued till he took over Tantra at the fag-end of the 90s. After a short stint, he moved on to greener pastures. His stint with Red Hot Chilli Pepper took him to Chennai for a couple of years. He joined Winning Streak in December. He simultaneously runs a dhaba in Sector V. 

 USP: The experience of 10 years in various hospitality segments and his interpersonal skills. 

 The toughest ask: ?The youngsters who come here are very well-behaved but sometimes some cranky customers do create problems.?

 Salaam Calcutta: ?The party crowd in Calcutta has grown by leaps and bound. Ten years ago, there were very few party people and only a couple of places to hang out. So we knew which place was the most crowded. But the attitude has changed. People try to check out a host of places in one night. So you have more of a floating crowd.? 

Tantra

 Manager: Anoop Ravindran

 Age: 24

 Experience: A commerce graduate from Pune, he studied hotel management at ISM Bombay. After some part- time jobs in sales, events and public relations, he joined The Park as a management trainee. After a small stint with Somepalce Else as an assistant manager, he has bagged the coveted post of the manager in Tantra. 

 USP: Intimidating him is a tough task, even for the tricky customers who land up.

 The toughest ask: ?Turning away nice people who do not have a partner or who don?t adhere to the dress code is very difficult. You really have to be nice to them and make them feel that they are most welcome anytime if they comply with the house rules.? 

 Salaam Calcutta: ?Being a guy from Mumbai I did not have much expectations from the party circuit in Calcutta. But I am glad to say that it can compete with any metropolitan city in terms of style, profile and spending power.?

Dublin

 Manager: Nitin Behl

 Age: 32

 Experience: He has seen the ups and downs of the hospitality industry. Worked in hotels like Grand Hyatt and Radisson in Delhi. His stint with different hotels in Switzerland helped him utilise his international experience in India once he returned. 

 USP: His personal relationship with guests and the ability to motivate his team.

 The toughest ask: ?There is nothing called a difficult job. Everything is a challenge and you have to meet it. That is what I am here for.?

 Salaam Calcutta: Being a Delhi guy, Nitin feels that the nocturnal creatures here are very warm. ?People are not ?made up? in Calcutta. They exude a lot of warmth and emotion. That is the reason I end up having an excellent rapport with most of my guests.? 

Incognito

 Manager: Yuvraj Singh Johar

 Age: 30

 Experience: He is from the first batch of IHM Aurangabad. Enjoyed stints with the Taj Delhi and The Park Delhi. He joined Taj Bengal two years ago. He is the executive assistant manager, F amp;B. 

 USP: According to Yuvraj Singh, it is his ability to track the changing trends in nightlife entertainment.

 The toughest ask: ?I always try to make sure that the guest is getting value for money. To ensure this I really have to see that my team is also working to achieve the same goal.?

 Salaam Calcutta: ? The average age of party people in Calcutta is slightly more than that of Mumbai and Delhi. Even the music pattern is different. Calcuttans drool over rock.?

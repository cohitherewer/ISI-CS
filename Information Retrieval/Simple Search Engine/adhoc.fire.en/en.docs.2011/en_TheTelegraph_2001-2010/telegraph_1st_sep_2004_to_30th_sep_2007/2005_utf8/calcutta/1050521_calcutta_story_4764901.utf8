The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 It's Your Birthday So...

 Always eager to finish projects on time, you?re efficient and cooperative but never aggressive. 

You prefer to run things rather than take orders. You?re ambitious, yet understanding and encouraging. For you, there is nothing called failure. You are very demanding in your relationships, but prefer to keep them on an even keel. ? Kusum Bhandari

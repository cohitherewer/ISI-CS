The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Stand shift on Nehru statue

 - Army nod for site switch and repairs, hunt on for sponsor

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The turf tussle over Jawaharlal Nehru?s statue at the Park Street-Chowringhee crossing has taken a new turn.

 The army has finally given the go-ahead for repairs to the 15-year-old structure, the base of which is dangerously damaged. But neither the army nor Writers? Buildings is willing to foot the bill.

 ?We?re happy the army has given permission to carry out repairs. However, it has said that since the statue was installed by the Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC), the army will not spend the money,? said PWD minister Amar Choudhury on Sunday.

 In a recent missive to chief secretary Ashok Gupta, GOC, Bengal area, major-general Z.U. Shah agreed that the statue needed repairs and offered an alternative site on the Maidan to relocate the statue while work is on, ending the impasse reported by Metro on May 28.

 In an offer regarded as a victory for the government, Shah also conceded that the statue could be moved back a few feet from its current position, as the original spot is vulnerable, with the Metro Railway running directly beneath it.

 The ICC had installed the 12-ft-tall bronze sculpture opposite Metro Bhavan in 1989 to commemorate the birth centenary of India?s first Prime Minister. In late 2004, cracks began to appear in the pedestal and the army was contacted. 

 Fort William then stated the location was not suitable for the statue and suggested it be moved to Raj Bhavan.

 The army offered to provide an alternative site on the Maidan only if the government failed to find a suitable site elsewhere, a stand the army has now softened.

 ICC secretary-general Nazeeb Arif said the industry body will look into the problem. ?We had donated the statue to the people of Calcutta and will take up the issue of repairs with our board. If it involves something we can afford, we?ll do it. However, it?s strange that both the army and the state government have so little interest in India?s first Prime Minister,? said Arif.

 ?If the army claims the statue is on its property and was damaged by vibrations from Metro Railway, the role of the ICC becomes minor. However, we are yet to hear from the PWD on starting repair work,? Arif added.

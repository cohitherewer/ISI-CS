The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 ?Honest film of emotions, real relationships?

 Waqt mdash; The Race Against Time is not only on its way to being a big hit in the country, it has also stormed the Top 10 charts in the UK. The film rsquo;s leading man and Mumbai distributor, AKSHAY KUMAR, speaks to Pratim D. Gupta about the secret of success, the partnership with Bachchan, and the chemistry with Priyanka

 Waqt has ended the drought of flops in Bollywood. What, do you think, worked for the film?s success?

 It is an honest film about emotions. We are real. The relationships are real. The incidents shown in the film have happened in other people?s lives. Everybody who loves someone fears losing him or her. So they could identify with the characters and situations. Just like I have done or Mr Bachchan has done.

 You know how impactful the film has been: I came to know from a friend of mine about this father-son duo who had been fighting for some time. The son?s mother asked them to go and watch Waqt. After the film they were crying like children and they did patch up!

 Ever since the release, I have been getting lots of SMSs and calls from friends and wellwishers saying how much they have related to the relationships. I think that has been the key for the success.

 And the overseas response has also been phenomenal?

 Yes, and they have been buying tickets in bulks, not even in small groups. Huge families along with friends and relatives are going to watch the film together. The response has been great in places like the UK, US and Canada. A film like this, showcasing our Indian roots and traditions, is a much safer bet than the other films through which we are trying to hit the overseas trade.

 Isn?t it the comedy which sets the pace for the film?

 Yes but people say all types of comedy work. I believe, it?s not slapstick comedy which works but situational comedy. Good comedy from funny situations works overseas. For a film like Hera Pheri, initially people thought it was slapstick and rejected it. Then they realised that it was black humour and the film started working everywhere, including the satellite telecasts.

 Vipul Shah has scored again after Aankhen. Is he the next big thing in Bollywood?

 I like Vipul as a person. As a director, he doesn?t like to stick to a single thing. He didn?t make another thriller after Aankhen, but went for a social (drama) like Waqt. And now he is planning something completely different from a thriller or a social. In an industry where people keep repeating the success formula, he is truly daring. Yahaan pe, comedy banate hain to banate rehte hain... If someone is known for his socials, then he would go on to do his Ph.D in socials. Nobody wants to try different areas. That?s where Vipul scores.

 And what about your combination with Amitabh Bachchan? 

 The more you talk about him, the less (is) said about him. We have finished six films together. Aise hi chalta raha to I will end up doing the most number of films with him. I know Shashi Kapoor and Vinod Khanna did around seven films with him. But if we go at this rate, I would end up doing more films with him.

 Your on-screen chemistry with Priyanka Chopra just can?t go wrong, it seems?

 We are working together for the fourth time and I thank my audience, which has reacted to our chemistry in such a positive way. I hope to continue doing good work and giving my fans something new along the way.

 When do we see you next on the big screen?

 Up next is Suneel Darshan?s Mere Jeevansaathi with Karisma Kapoor and Amisha Patel. Then there?s the Hera Pheri sequel titled Phir Hera Pheri. I have also shot recently for Vikram Bhatt?s Deewane Hue Pagal and Priyadarshan?s Garam Masala.

 You turned distributor with Waqt. Any plans to turn producer?

 No. I want to stay happy. I distributed Waqt in Mumbai because I wanted to gift my dad this film. I wanted to dedicate Waqt to him and so bought the rights. I do not want to get into the business of film-making.

 Time to cheer

 Waqt is one of the few Indian films to make it to the Top 10 UK charts

 The other Bollywood biggies to have stormed the British charts have mostly been Shah Rukh Khan-starrers like Dil Se, Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham and Chalte Chalte

 In its opening weekend, Waqt debuted at number 10 on the UK charts with a total collection of pound;208,254 and the best screen average of pound;6,125.

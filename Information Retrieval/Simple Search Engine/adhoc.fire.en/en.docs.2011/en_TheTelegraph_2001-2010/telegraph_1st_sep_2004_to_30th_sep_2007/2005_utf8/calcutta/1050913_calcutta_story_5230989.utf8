 Five persons were arrested at Calcutta airport on Monday for allegedly submitting fake appointment letters to the Airport Authority of India. During interrogation, Christopher George, S. Yadav, Dilip Chowdhury, Bikash Singh and Amar Kumar Singh told police that they had paid Rs 20,000 each to some brokers, who had promised them jobs. The brokers handed over photocopies of appointment letters, which turned out to be fake.

In the afternoon, a taxi driver was injured after a bus on route 55/1 hit his vehicle on Howrah bridge. He was taken to the Howrah district hospital.

 The high court on Monday asked Eastern Railway to allow three days to a private contractor for ?finishing work? at the Chitpur railway terminal. Justice Jayanta Biswas ruled that the authorities ?could take action in accordance with law? if the contractor failed to start work within that period. 

 Anima Bose, 54, suffered head injury after being assaulted by a gang that barged into her house in Taratala early on Monday. The gang, however, did not loot anything. Around the same time, another gang broke into the house of Dipankar Chakraborty, 36, in Parnasree, and demanded the key to his locker. When he refused to hand over the key, the group beat him up. The assailants fled after Chakraborty raised an alarm.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Museum debut in Manipur

 A STAFF REPORTER

 What better way to celebrate International Museum Day than to open a museum in a place that hasn?t got one? 

 National Council of Science Museums (NCSM) is doing just that on May 18, in Manipur. Under the aegis of its parent body, NCSM, Calcutta?s Birla Industrial and Technological Museum (BITM) has built Manipur?s first science centre in Imphal, and will inaugurate it on Wednesday.

 The project was started in 2001, to build science centres in the northeastern states, at the rate of one every year. 

 Since 2003, BITM director Jayanta Sthanapati has been responsible for setting up three so far. In 2003, a science centre in Aizawl, Mizoram, was set up. The following year saw the inauguration of the museum in Dimapur, Nagaland.

 On International Museum Day, he will be at the inauguration of the third in Imphal, with the chief minister of Manipur present. 

 ?The new centre is divided into four blocks, each of around 2,500 sq ft. There are two galleries on human performance and fun science,? Sthanapati explained. 

 The third area has an inflatable dome planetarium, auditorium and children?s activity corner. The fourth area has a conference room, office, library and workshop

 The total area of five acres includes a science park around the building, with 32 interactive exhibits and five dinosaur models.

 The cost of Rs 2 crore is shared on a 20-80 basis by the state and central governments. 

 The running cost of about Rs 15 lakh per year will be provided by the state, added Sthanapati. 

 ?We have three more centres to establish in the next few years,? he signed off.

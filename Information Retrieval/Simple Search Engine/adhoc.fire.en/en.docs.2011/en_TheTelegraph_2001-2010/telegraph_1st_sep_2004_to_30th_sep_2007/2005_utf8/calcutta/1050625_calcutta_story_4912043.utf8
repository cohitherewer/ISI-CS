 Much of central Calcutta was hit by aftershocks of the crippling Friday midday blow to Howrah bridge.

 Soon after the bridge ? the main link between Calcutta and Howrah ? was closed to vehicles, traffic movement on several thoroughfares in the central business district came to a near-standstill.

 By 3.30 pm, around half-an-hour after the closure, there were traffic snarls on all roads leading to the bridge, with the ripple effect spreading fast.

 On both sides of Howrah bridge, barricades were put up blocking the road from 3.05 pm till around 5 pm, during which time only pedestrians were allowed to walk across.

 ?We stopped traffic movement on the bridge immediately after receiving instructions from Calcutta Port Trust. They told us the pressure of vehicular movement might cause more damage to the structure,? explained deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Arun Kumar Sharma.

 This threw traffic out of gear for over two hours.

 ?After receiving instructions from the deputy commissioner, we sent an alert to all personnel deployed on the bridge over wireless. The officers of North Port police station were instructed to block traffic movement on the bridge as soon as possible,? added an officer at the Lalbazar traffic control room.

 A team of six sergeants was asked to divert all vehicles plying along Strand Road, heading towards Howrah.

 ?The vehicles were diverted towards the city through the Brabourne Road flyover. But the bottleneck there caused total traffic chaos for over two hours,? said the officer.

 The traffic control room reported congestion all along Strand Road, Brabourne Road, Ganesh Chandra Avenue and Government Place East Road till well into the evening.

 ?With the bridge closed to peak-hour traffic, people returning from office and school crowded the roads in the area,? said a sergeant on duty at the Calcutta end of the bridge.

 Anxious long-distance train passengers made matters worse, trying to bypass the roadblocks to take the straight route to the station, the sergeant added.

 Officers from the North Port police station dispatched to manage the situation said the crowd of curious onlookers, several hundred strong, which assembled on the bridge, further compounded the congestion.

 Finally, the mess on the streets forced many commuters to take the water route across the Hooghly.

 The rush at the Howrah jetty was far worse than what is usually experienced during the afternoon.

 ?Usually, 3 pm to 6 pm is taken as peak time, but today, as this was the only way to cross, there was a terrible rush,? explained one of the ticket checkers at the Howrah jetty.

 Launches were plying continuously between Babughat and Howrah, packed with people.

 But large numbers had chosen to walk the length of the bridge instead.

 ?We would not have been able to support the rush of so many people,? admitted the master of a ferry plying the Howrah-Sovabazar route.

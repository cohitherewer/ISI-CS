 To most Calcuttans, Dim Sum is nothing but steamed starters. But they could be fried tit bits and soups with fish and meatballs, too. The festival shall bring foodies authentic and exotic Dim Sum fare, which literally means to dot the heart with. So, the festival is sure to touch the heart, says executive chef Sujan Mukherjee.

 Moreover, the festival culture has undergone a change. It is not only pampering yourself with delicacies but also checking on your calorie count. Dim Sum with less oil content is light, tasty and yet healthy, adds Mukherjee.

 One can start with Sticky Rice Soup with Chicken or Sticky Rice Soup with Coriander. Peppered with a dash of creativity is the Sweet Corn Soup Lian Style that comes in options of vegetables or chicken or crab.

 Non-vegetarians can gorge on the traditional Phoenix Claw Dim Sum and Steamed Pork Spare Ribs with Black Beans, the Lamb Wotib, Crispy Lamb Spare Ribs and Steamed Duck and Vegetable Broth. The Prawn and Sesame Suimai is also worth a try.

 Bengali bite

 In the run-up to the Pujas, Orkos Restaurant and Lounge Bar at City Centre has come up with its own festive fare. On Thursday night, Orkos unveiled a range to give customers a taste of Bengal.

 Attending the launch of the new range of Bengali cuisine at the Salt Lake hangout was a star-studded line-up led by Swastika, Deboleena, Arunima, Kamalika, Ratul, Arindam and Biplab.

 And then there was the sweet platter including rosogolla, mishti doi, sandesh and payesh.

 But why lay out a Bengali spread? Says Ratna Sen, one of the managing directors of Orkos: Bengal has a long tradition of people who love to eat. And Indian cuisine can never be complete without Bengali food, which is so varied in both taste and flavour. Since we reach out to a wide clientele, we thought of launching this cuisine. And it could not have come at a better time.

 Most dishes are priced between Rs 200 and Rs 250.

 Cook look

 When you attend a cookery workshop that gives you every detail, serving up an Oriental fare seems to be no big deal.

 Ladies Circle Area 4, in association with ITC Sonar Bangla, played host to a cookery workshop at the Pan Asian on September 21. 

 The six items showcased by chef Pramod Sinha were an assortment of Japanese, Chinese, Thai and Mongolian.

 I have whipped up the dishes keeping in mind the Indian palate. Feasibility of raw ingredients has been an important aspect, too, explained Sinha.

 Forty ladies from all over the city witnessed a live demonstration of vegetarian delicacies like the Gong Bao- Stir Fried Asian Vegetables with Cashew Nuts, Ginger Corn Fried Rice, Spinach Pancakes, Braised Noodle served with Bell Peppers, Black Mushroom and Spring Onion, Red Date Pancake and Thai Vegetable Curry.

 It was an interactive session with the chef patiently answering every query. 

 Anecdotes about the origins of the dishes and their names made the session more interesting. Also on offer were some useful culinary tips.

 A workshop on these lines will be served up every two months at one of the signature outlets in town. So, keep cooking.

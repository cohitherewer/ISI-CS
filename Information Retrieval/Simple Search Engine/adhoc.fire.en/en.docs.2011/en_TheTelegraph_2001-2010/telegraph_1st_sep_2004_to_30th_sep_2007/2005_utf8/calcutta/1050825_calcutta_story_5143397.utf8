The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Know English, won?t teach college 

 - Private school products shun eligibility test, opt for school posts

 MITA MUKHERJEE 

 Aruna Mukherjee (name changed), a postgraduate in English, was a student of a Loreto school in central Calcutta. Her ambition was to become a college teacher. She has become a teacher, but has opted to teach students of an English-medium school in south Calcutta.

 Rimli Banerjee (name changed), a former student of South Point School, passed MA in history with more than 60 per cent marks in 2002. Teaching in a college had been her childhood dream, which she had fulfilled, but in an English-medium school in Salt Lake.

 Outstanding students, mostly girls, passing out from reputed English-medium schools with an ambition to be a lecturer are having a change of heart by the time they become postgraduates. 

 They are, instead, preferring to teach in private English-medium schools, for a far lower remuneration.

 Their ranks are swelling, as is evident from the number of students from English-medium schools sitting for the state-level eligibility test (SLET), conducted by the West Bengal College Service Commission to recruit lecturers for state-aided colleges (figures in box).

 Sources attribute the trend to rampant politics, a repressive environment, lack of discipline and a culture that frowns on conversation in English in state-aided colleges. ?These factors are turning away bright students with an English-medium background from our institutions,? said a senior lecturer of a government college.

 Rimli Banerjee, a schoolteacher, said: ?I had dreamt of becoming a lecturer. But later I realised I would be a mismatch in a state-aided college.?

 The other deterrent is the practice of sending recruits from the city to colleges in faraway rural areas. 

 ?I could not have communicated with my students if I had to teach in a college in Canning, in South 24-Parganas,? pointed out Aruna Mukherjee.

 ?There is no doubt that the number of applicants from English-medium schools is falling every year. But we don?t seem to have a solution,? admitted commission chairman Ajit Banik.

 The authorities? concern over the trend stems from the fact that the pass percentage in SLET has been dismal (this year, it was 4.2). 

 Officials feel the percentage would surely rise if high-performers from city-based English-medium schools take the test.

 Some commission officials, however, claim that brilliant students are joining schools at a lesser salary because they would be able to earn much more through private tuitions than what a college teacher does.

 The information, they say, has been gleaned from an informal survey among a cross-section of SLET candidates.

 ?The salary of a college lecturer at the time of joining is around Rs 13,000. But a teacher of a reputed English-medium school can earn as much as Rs 30,000 if she/he also coaches students in private,? said an official.

 Ismail Nehal, president of Association of Teachers of Anglo-Indian Schools, said: ?The trend is not desirable, as this will lead to exploitation of teachers.?

 Gunjan nailed for murder of mentor

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 It wasn?t Arvind Bhai alone. Gunjan Ghosh, the brain behind Roma Jhawar?s abduction from Salt Lake, had also murdered Biswajit Dey, the man who initiated him into the business of transporting schoolchildren, claimed police.

 The cops learnt about Gunjan?s role in the murder on Wednesday, following the arrest in Beleghata of Ashish Majhi, the driver of the car in which Dey was shot dead from point-blank range.

 The motive of the murder, police claimed, was greed. Gunjan, apparently, wanted to take over Dey?s business. 

 The breakthrough came 48 hours after police took Gunjan in their custody in connection with the murder of Dey.

 A resident of Gagan Sarkar Road, in Narkeldanga, Dey was last seen with Gunjan on the night of July 4, 2004. 

 The next day, Dey?s body was found wrapped in a plastic bag beside the Narkeldanga canal. The body had a bullet injury on the head.

 An established name in the business of transporting schoolchildren in the Beleghata, Phoolbagan and Narkeldanga areas, Dey took a fancy to Gunjan and gave him a few sub-contracts. 

 ?Gunjan had an insatiable lust for money. He had chalked out the plan of murdering Dey, to perfection,? said Javed Shamim, deputy commissioner of police (eastern suburban division).

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Hospital in distress

 DEBASHISH CHATTOPADHYAY AND JULIUS GOMES 

 HEALTHWATCH: The Garden Reach hospital

 Residents of Badartala had to struggle for six years to get then chief minister lay the foundation stone of Garden Reach State General Hospital in 1990.

 They had to wait another seven years for the outdoor department to become functional, and a further three years for the indoor department to be set up.

 Yet, in January 2005, the hospital premises are vacant, with only four patients admitted. With most of the rooms locked, the walls covered in cobwebs and dust floating thick in the air, the building looks haunted.

 Garden Reach State General Hospital was intended to be a 131-bed facility, complete with surgical, paediatric, gynaecological, medicine, dental and ENT departments, accommodated in four rows of buildings on a 30-acre plot. It currently functions as a 10-bed indoor facility.

 Apart from superintendent Siraj Ahmed, the hospital has seven doctors ? one for surgery, two in the paediatric department, one gynaecologist, one for medicine, a dentist and a general physician.

 There?s also a nurse, a pharmacist, two Group-D employees, a gatekeeper and a night guard. There is also an ambulance, but no garage.

 According to Kushal Debnath of Garden Reach Nagarik Parishad, only around 250 patients can be attended every day. Minor stitches, saline drips and first aid are administered.

 ?Over the past four years, we have put up road blocks and called bandhs demanding facilities for the emergency department, operating theatre, paediatric department, X-ray unit and pathology department, but nothing has materialised,? Debnath lamented.

 ?There is a dentist, but no equipment for him to use. There are no instruments in the operating theatre. Drinking water is not available. Thieves have made off with doors and windows,? said local resident Tarun Kumar Pal.

 When contacted, superintendent Siraj Ahmed refused to comment on the situation. 

 Copies of documents with Metro, bearing Ahmed?s signature, indicate that the hospital and government officials had raised a lot of questions, but nothing had changed at the hospital.

 In August, the office of the chief medical officer of Health (CMOH), South 24-Parganas, had sent a circular to the hospital superintendent, listing it as one of the ?very low performance? hospitals in the district, and sought a report on the present condition.

 In his reply to CMOH Pradip Mandal, dated August 30, Ahmed had stated that ?the bed-turnover rate performance is poor in this hospital due to non-availability of service advantages or facilities?.

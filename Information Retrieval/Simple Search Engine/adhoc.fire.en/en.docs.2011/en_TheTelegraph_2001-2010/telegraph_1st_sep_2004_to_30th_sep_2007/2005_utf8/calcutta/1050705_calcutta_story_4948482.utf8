 Tongue Twister 

 Musician and foodie Nondon Bagchi is flush with hot flavours of 

 the humble chilli mdash; the mainstay of many a cuisine

 My father had a friend who had a passionate fondness for chillies. During his travels in North India he met up with a much-travelled European gentleman who considered India to be one of his favourite places and he was particularly partial to the cuisine. They got talking; one thing led to another and, young and reckless as they were then, they challenged each other to a chilli eating competition. 

 The rules were simple. Both would eat a meal consisting of the same items and of approximately the same quantity and the winner would be the one who could eat the most green chillies along with the meal. Uncle Surajit was comprehensively beaten. But he was gracious in defeat and while admitting that this was an unexpected result, he was curious to know how his foreign friend had developed such a threshold of tolerance for the fiery fruit. It was then that he found out that the gentleman had grown up on a Mexican chilli farm!

 Chillies are the most characteristic seasoning in Mexican cuisine. Fresh or dried, mild or hot, they appear in a multitude of dishes, from the intricately spiced Mole (pronounced MOH-lay) a sauce which has several varieties of chilli along with other ingredients such as chocolate, almonds and resins to the simple party dip they call Chilli con Queso (chilli with cheese) to of course possibly the most celebrated Mexican dish, Chilli con Carne (chilli with meat).

 There is an amazing variety, with exotic sounding names like serrano, pasilla ancho, guero, japones, jalapeno, pico de pajaro, arbol, tepin, cascabel, chipotle and guajillo and they are used and prepared in many different ways. Some have skins, which must be peeled and they will use methods such as broiling, roasting or frying to facilitate this. The worlds hottest variety of chilli was also said to be from Mexico. Recently I read somewhere that the honour has now gone to Tezpur, in Assam.

 In Indian cuisine the chilli is used dry, ground or fresh in virtually every recipe. But in fact, it is the north-east of this subcontinent which is blessed with as much variety, and where the cuisine is as dependent on the chilli, as anywhere in the world. The people, generally, have a very hot tooth and consume enormous quantities of this wonderful gift of nature, using it lavishly in their simple yet delicious cuisine. Coincidentally, and interestingly, many of the people bear a strong resemblance to Mexicans as well, and with their sartorial preference for hats, ponchos, jeans, fancy belts and high-heeled, calf-length leather boots, you have to sometimes pinch yourself to remember that you are not on the set of some Western film in the Sierra Madre mountains. Topographically, of course, the regions are quite different.

 Except for a place called Ukhrul, near the Manipur-Burma border, set high up on a dry and dusty windswept plateau, bitterly cold, where we went to play a Christmas concert once. This small town with its single main street and mule drawn carts actually did have the exact feel of such a movie setting. Our hosts were a gracious Naga family; had one dinner and one lunch with them. Boiled, crunchy vegetables whose water, like a stock, we mixed with the sticky rice they have there, pork with bamboo shoots and dry red chillies, fried fish and two or three explosive chutneys to liven things up. Practically no oil is used, and hardly any spices. It is clean and simple. Chillies are the main condiment. One of the finest varieties of chilli I have ever had is the smoked raja mircha of Nagaland. Very hot and full of flavour, it does not hit you hard but comes on like a smooth afterglow. And you really glow. Absolutely the perfect choice if you are making Chilli con Carne.

 Another hot favourite of the region is the stew of vegetables, shrimp, roasted fish and dried fish they make in Tripura. The main ingredient here is the dried ? rather preserved ? fish typical of the region. It has a strong smell, but when roasted over a flame and put in the stew it is milder, and adds the required flavour. Not a drop of oil is used; the ingredients are simply boiled together. Aubergines, cabbage, radish, flat beans, tomatoes, potatoes, ginger, garlic, onions, roasted fish, dried fish and shrimps and lots and lots of slit green and dry red chillies. Served hot with plain rice, it must scald the tongue, or it isnt done right.

 Then there is the Ema Dashi ? chilli cheese ? of Bhutan, which is not that different from the Chilli con Queso of Mexico except that the former involves no cooking in oil, whereas in the latter it does. A delicious dish; the best I had was in Phuntsholing. Just chopped chillies and onions boiled in water, with butter and cheese added later. Excellent for the sinuses, nutritious and great during the chill of winter. 

 And then there are the pickles, chutneys and sauces that pay tribute to the chilli in all the cultures and cuisines of the world.

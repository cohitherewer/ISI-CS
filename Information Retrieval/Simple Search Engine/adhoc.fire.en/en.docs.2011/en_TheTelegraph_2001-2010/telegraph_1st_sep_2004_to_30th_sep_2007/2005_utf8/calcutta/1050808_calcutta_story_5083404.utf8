 The glamour of the Sixties was a phenomenon that developed into a culture by itself. It was also the time when Park Street became the most sought-after night address in Calcutta. 

 Roxy, the latest entertainment destination at The Park, pays tribute to that time and age, when a night out was, well, just classier.

 As soon as you enter the place, it uplifts you. Be it the sleek yet sheer d?cor, the dim yet soothing lighting, the classy cocktails or the music, its a complete whole that transports you to a more carefree zone, says Anirban Simlai, F amp;B manager of The Park. 

 Inside out

 If you happen to drive past Park Street on any given evening, youll spot some aqua creeping through a glass facade right off the hotel driveway. Thats your first introduction to Roxy, the cocktail bar. 

 Polished aluminium against unfinished brick masonry and modern, almost space-age mezzanine, immediately catch your eye.

 The highlight of the place is, however, its spatial simplicity. The furniture draws inspiration from stylish elements of the late 1960s, explains a spokesperson. 

 Created by interior designer Sandeep Khosla, the place has a soothing effect thats very contemporary. On the upholstery front, brushed brass, zebrano veneer and chenille are very 60s materials, while a frosted glass wall bathed in aqua light lends a modern virtual existence.

 Sound stock

 DJ Sethi of Tantra has shifted base to Roxy, with a solid repertoire of feel-good music up his sleeve. Its going to be very retro, progressive lounge music thats chilled out and lifts your mood. 

 Vocals from the Fifties splashed with Sixties rhythm and Seventies electronica have been perfectly synchronised to produce a stunning effect, says a spokesperson.

 A mobile DJ unit at the far end of the bar will allow Sethi to be more interactive. 

 Fun food

 The menu includes light bites, both Indian and continental, that go down well with the drinks. While assorted platters are available, some single items pop up, too. 

 Be it the Lebanese Mezze Assortment, Golden Fried Risotto Balls, Cheese Platter, Tikka Pita Bite or Balinese Satay Lilit on Lemon Grass Skewer, theres something that appeals to almost every palate. 

 A lot of emphasis has been placed on creating a contemporary style with multi-appeal. Hence, the mixture of Indian, Thai, Italian, Lebanese and even Mexican cuisine, says Simlai. As for the presentation, its all up to French executive chef Yvonnick Jegat Deniau.

 Mood menu

 The beverage menu focuses on cocktails and fancy drinks that have a chilled-out feel. Its all very lounge-like, explains Simlai.

 With 56 varieties of wine, 30 kinds of vodka ? the flavoured, regular and branded ? and an extensive list of cocktails in keeping with its ideology, the bar at Roxy is stocked to suit anyone, anytime. 

 The cocktails will be mood-based. The barman will ask you how youre feeling and accordingly make the perfect mix for you, says Simlai.

 Watch out for those serving you, as their stylish gear with floral prints has been specially created by Kiran Uttam Ghosh.

 Whats more, those who love their old-style puff can take their pick from an admirable cigar collection.

 Law rein on rash drivers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The police have asked the government to introduce a piece of legislation that makes rash driving a non-bailable offence, attracting heavy penalty.

 Additional commissioner of police (IV) C.V. Muralidhar made the disclosure during a seminar organised by Calcutta Police to mark the 150-year celebrations of the force.

 The seminar, called ?The police mean business?, was meant to be an interface between the cops and the industry. Suggestions were sought on ways to improve the functioning of the force.

 Responding to queries about traffic management, Muralidhar said weak laws were an impediment in bringing rash drivers to task. 

 ?We register cases against rash drivers, but they are often released on bail. Justice is meted out only when the case comes up for hearing, which may be after 15 years. Till then, the drivers are free to drive on the road,? he explained. 

 When asked if police could ensure immediate implementation of the legislation, Muralidhar said the ball was in the government?s court. ?How fast they bring about the legislation depends on them,? he pointed out.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya circumvented the question by saying the government was bound by the ?constitution of procedures?.

 Representatives from the industry included managing director of Bengal Ambuja Harshvardhan Neotia, general manager of Wipro Indu Khattar, chairman of Confederation of Indian Industry (eastern region) Ravi Poddar and managing director of PricewaterhouseCoopers Roopen Roy.

 The participants agreed on the need for a partnership between Calcutta Police and the software industry to equip the cops with skills to prevent cyber crimes, a potent threat with the city developing into an IT hub.

 Roy, who stressed on the need for the partnership, also suggested the use of technology to increase police interface with the public. ?Why can?t we have a system, where a complainant can lodge a diary and check its status online?? he asked.

 Khattar spoke about the police?s ignorance of the functioning of the IT industry.

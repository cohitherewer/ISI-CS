The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You cant get through this week without...

 Kick-starting your Puja shopping

 With less than 60 days to go for the festival, its time you set out with your shopping bag. If that seems too early, think about the exciting discounts offered by every other store in town to cash in on the festive frenzy. From clothes to accessories, home d?cor to furniture, the price tags read lower and lower these days. The other incentive to shop could be the new festive line that almost every fashion designer has come up with. So, whether you want to pamper yourself with a brand new Sabyasachi Mukherjee creation or take your pick from the middle-rung designer brigade, just do it?

 Catching some real-life action

 After the plethora of period films (first Parineeta and then Mangal Pandey ? The Rising), its time to get back to some modern-day, real-life action with the Ram Gopal Verma-Anil Kapoor Production My Wifes Murder. Based on a true story, the film revolves around an accidental murder of a wife (played by Suchitra Krishnamurthy) by her husband (Anil Kapoor). The one-hour-40-minute film directed by Jijy Philip doesnt have a single song and this enhances the serious feel. Commendable performances by Anil, Suchitra, Nandana Sen and Boman Irani, and the signature RGV treatment make this worth a watch.

 Sipping on infused vodkas

 Move over regular vodka. Even the vanilla, raspberry, strawberry, lime and other flavours offered by the liquor brands are passe. Freshly-infused vodka in flavours like lemon grass, chilli, peppercorn and cinnamon is the new thing on the bar block. And a good place to try these out is Roxy, the brand new cocktail bar at The Park. Apart from housing 30 different brands of vodka, the bar whips up these infused flavours with regular Smirnoff vodka. So, take your pick from the fresh flavours to hit a high.

 Taking a monsoon break

 The monsoons are on their way out and if you havent had a chance to romance the rains this season, you better act before its too late. Take out a couple of days from your schedule and head for a beach destination ? or a hill station, if thats more your thing. Also, the nearby getaways are not likely to be too crowded now with the extended I-Day weekend having come and gone.

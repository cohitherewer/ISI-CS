 Jennifer Lopez: Music speaks

 ?I?ve grown a lot since my first album. Vocally, I?ve become more confident. I record songs with a different attack ? with a different vigour.? This comes from the all-new Jennifer Lopez. And no wonder her latest album has been christened Rebirth.

 Sony BMG Music India will release the album on March 1. The first single Get right was released on January 31. The single is already a hit.

 For the music on the album, she tells her publicists, ?I took some time off last year, which was hard for me to do, as that?s not really in my genes ? it?s not part of my makeup. There were times when my life was like a roller-coaster ride, but as an artiste, you need time for clarity.?

 So Lopez did what she felt she needed to do. She took a good hard look at her life and career and decided that she had to rediscover ?the same person I was before On the 6?.

 Lopez is, of course, referring to her multimillion-selling 1999 debut album. ?I had to put things in perspective,? she adds. ?It was time to rejuvenate.?

 Rebirth is her fourth solo album. Welcome to the next phase in Lopez?s career, which encompasses music, film, perfume and fashion. Enter Rebirth!

 Lopez says she could not have named the new album anything else. ?For me, the title is incredibly significant,? she says. ?All you have to give, as an artiste, are your experiences, your life,? Lopez continues.

 ?That?s where it should come through ? not through a silly tabloid. Sure, the media got out of hand these past couple of years. I?m an artiste. That?s what put me in the media in the first place. But I can?t be a crazy, little girl anymore. It?s time to put the spotlight back on my career.? Even as Calcutta awaits her next movie An Unfinished Life, Rebirth, a collection steeped in pop, hip-hop, Latin, funk and dance, is poised to do just that.

Sourav Ganguly and Inzamam-ul-Haq: It?s war time

 With the much-awaited India-Pakistan cricket series knocking at the door, it?s time to pad up again. To feed the fervour this season, STAR News has devised a special and exclusive programme on Pakistan?s tour to the country. Under the popular cricket-special umbrella brand, Wah! Cricket, the channel will air special programmes, live updates, expert views, in-depth analysis, debates and behind-the scenes exclusives titled Kisme Kitna Hai Dum.

 The half-hour special is being telecast every day at 7.30 pm and will provide an insight into the three Tests and six ODIs starting from March 8. Once the series commences, there will be another half-hour special to be aired daily at 8.30 am. This special coverage will also feature Inzamam-ul-Haq and Sanjay Manjrekar as experts.

 Some of the special features on the show include Reporter?s Diary, a showcase of the lighter side of the game, taking the viewers behind the scenes with dressing room talk, after-play discussions and strategy meetings.

 Yaadein, the nostalgic nugget, will feature the golden moments from previous India-Pakistan clashes on the cricket field.

 Even as little Ayesha Kapur takes a bow for her performance in Black, a film called Amy is set to be beamed on the small screen (Hungama TV, March 2, 8 pm and repeat on March 3, 2.30 pm) about an eight-year-old child rendered deaf and mute after witnessing the electric shock death on stage during a rainstorm of her rock star father.

 If it took the persistence of teacher Devraj Sahay to break into the black world of Michelle, here it is Amy?s mother and a young music school dropout living next door who help her break out of her self-imposed isolation through music. The girl ends up transforming the lives of everyone around her.

 Filmmakers Nadia Tass and David Parker, who brought Malcolm, The Big Steal and Mr Reliable to the big screen, have collaborated to deliver the moving film. Starring Australian Film Institute Award winners Rachel Griffiths and Ben Mendelson, and featuring rock musician Nick Barker in his first acting role, along with eight-year-old discovery Alana De Roma, this is also the story of a young mother whose idealistic lifestyle is shattered by a traumatic event. She is faced with the prospect of life as a single mother, as she struggles to reach out to her daughter, who has cut herself off from the world.

 The winner of 23 international film festival awards, Amy has been crowned best film at the Grand Prix Cannes Junior, Le Prix Education Nationale at the Cannes Film Festival, the Gioffini Film Festival in Italy and the Australian People?s Choice Awards, etc.

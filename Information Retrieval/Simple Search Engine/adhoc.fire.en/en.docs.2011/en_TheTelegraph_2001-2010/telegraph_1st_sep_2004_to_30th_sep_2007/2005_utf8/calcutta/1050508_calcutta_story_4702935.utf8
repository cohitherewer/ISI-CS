The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 We are like that only

 Non-Indianness no longer sells automatically in a market defined by the Yeh dil maange more cry

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 It was well past midnight. The coffee shop in this five-star hotel in Delhi was still jam-packed. That is when the incident happened. To be very honest, 30 or more years back, the incident would not have deserved an inch of space in a newspaper. Growing up in an ambience of huge colonial hangover was more the rule rather than an exception. The world then was not indulgent. These children of the other midnight suffered. The likes of the Brigadier?s son or the ICS officer?s daughter were the exceptions. Their nurture ensured their comfort. Worse still, they became the role models for the rest. The corporate world sensed their new-found status.

 Naturally, marketing followed the elitist culture. Naturally, because unlike production or finance, this business function reflects the ethos of the operating managers. Brand names and ad campaigns were, more often than not, conceived in English. Akinness to the sahibs, or perhaps more appropriately the non-nativity, was a popular image platform. A low-priced cigarette meant for the small towns of Andhra thus got christened Horizon. It is another matter that the brand had to be withdrawn because the locals pronounced it as Harijan.

 But that was many moons ago. The India that walked into the new millennium had by then found its own concoction. Being Indian was in. More importantly, affluence had been allowed an Indian expression. The marketing world, by then inhabited by the new generation, responded sensitively. Yeh dil maange more ? an all-time-great copy ? adorned the advertising of as international a brand as Pepsi. True, the alien influence in marketing of today is not insignificant but non-Indianness no longer sells automatically. This is not a finding of an anthropological study. It is an everyday observation that can be made by anyone who uses his eyes and mouth in the proportion that they exist in the human body.

 Cut to the coffee shop. The waitress ushered a group to the next table. Among other things, they ordered two large whiskies. All hell broke loose. The man wanted his favourite brand. This was an expensive Scotch that is now bottled in India. The steward responded with a tinge of pride in his tone: ?Sorry, sir, we do not serve Indian whisky.? The man asked for an explanation: why shouldn?t a hotel in India serve a brand to an Indian guest just because it is made in India? The steward was unrelenting. His thoughts possibly were ?Oh, one of those uneducated (does not drink genuine Scotch) but rich (he can afford a five-star dinner for six) businessman (how else can you make money without being educated!)?. The rest of the conversation could not be heard. But they certainly did not live happily thereafter.

 The issue is straightforward. The hotel does not want to stock Indian brands of liquor for whatever reason. May be the clientele of such brands is not comfortable for them. Or that these brands offer lesser margins. Or that the more expensive imports would not sell then. The hotel is obviously within its rights. The real issue is the strategy of the authorities to make it an image creator. As a claim, ?we do not stock Indian brands? should have become pass? by now. It is tragic that it has not. Not only because in a few years we will celebrate the diamond jubilee of Independence. Perhaps more critically, its use reflects ignorance about the emerging Indian consumer.

 The hotel should have checked with Pepsi. Or better still with Kellogg.

 Rs12-cr rehab address on Bypass

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 A state-of-the-art rehabilitation hospital is coming up at Nayabad, behind the Peerless Hospital campus on the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass.

 Spread over 56 cottahs, the new hospital, named Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Medical Rehabilitation Centre, has just received government approval and work will start on the first phase, whose cost is estimated at Rs 12 crore.

 ?We have plans to gradually expand and create more awareness about rehabilitation among people. This centre will have all the facilities required for medical rehabilitation,? explained M.M. Ghatak, chief consultant of the hospital.

 The focus of rehabilitation centres is helping victims of crippling accidents, diseases or congenital abnormality to become aware of their potential and overcome their handicaps to begin life afresh.

 Apart from the mandatory indoor beds, the hospital will have neuro-orthopaedic surgery, pathology, radiology, diagnostics and outpatients? departments spread on the sprawling campus.

 A long-term rehabilitation residential home, where paralytic and disabled people will be provided with life-long accommodation, job training, placements in suitable house jobs and recreational and life support systems, too, is part of the plan.

 A dedicated floor for patients will provide facilities for a six-12-month period, where patients will get suitable job training and short-term accommodation (15 days to two months). 

 They will also be given medical treatment, along with lodging, for a period of 15 days to two months.

 ?We have a very ambitious project to start a rehabilitation college and school for the disabled, where a person will be taught everything about starting life afresh. We get many people, who have never worked but suddenly have become a burden on their families. We would like to help all of them,? added Ghatak.

 The rehabilitation school and college will have the following features:

 Schooling for young students, who a have a minor orthopaedic or neurological problem following accident or disease

 A disabled students? training school and college and a physiotherapy college

 A college on psychotherapy and occupational therapy

 A short-term training programme for doctors, therapists and dieticians and driving training school.

 The new hospital will boast a market complex-cum-shopping centre on the campus, with market facilities and rehabilitation shops. These will showcase and sell products from small-scale units, books, journals and artefacts from art galleries.

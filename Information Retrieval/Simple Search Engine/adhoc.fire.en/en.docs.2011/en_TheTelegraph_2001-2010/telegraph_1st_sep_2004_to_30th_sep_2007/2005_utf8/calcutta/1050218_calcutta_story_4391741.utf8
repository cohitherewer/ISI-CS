 Breather from green suit

 - Court opts out of Maidan row to assist govt, army process

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The high court on Thursday adjourned for eight weeks the hearing of the case relating to the development of the Maidan, with an observation that the process of beautification had been started and the judiciary should not intervene repeatedly.

 The division bench of Justice Asim Banerjee and Justice Rajendra Nath Sinha also expressed satisfaction over the CPM?s efforts to clean the green within 24 hours of its Maidan meeting last week.

 ?Let this practice continue... After polls, political parties should clean the walls of the city,? the judges observed.

 The bench also said that when both the army and the state were jointly undertaking the beautification of the Maidan, the court should not interfere at every step.

 ?But everyone has the liberty to approach us if he or she finds anything wrong in the development process. The division bench sits every Thursday and we will be ready to listen to the grievances,? said Justice Banerjee.

 The judges adjourned the hearing after Subhas Dutta, petitioner of the case, informed the court that the GOC-in-C of Eastern Command, Fort William, had convened a meeting during the day to discuss the Maidan revamp.

 ?The city police chief, some NGOs and private entrepreneurs were present at the meeting,? Dutta told the court.

 When the bench decided not to hear the matter any more, Dutta told the judges that he had filed a supplementary affidavit urging the court to frame a code of conduct with respect to beautification of the Maidan.

 ?We aren?t bothered who the custodians of the ground are. We want environmental development of the lungs of the city. The beautification programme should be based on planning in accordance with ecological norms,? said Dutta.

 Government pleader Rabilal Moitra moved to oppose the petitioner?s prayer, but the court said: ?Don?t worry, we are not hearing Dutta at present. You will have the liberty to file an affidavit in opposition when he will be heard.?

 The government pleader then raised the issue relating to the government?s rights over the Maidan. ?We have documents to prove the government?s claim on the Maidan. Our government is not ready to seek permission from the army before using the grounds,? asserted Moitra.

 To this, Justice Banerjee said: ?Our bench had already modified the earlier order of another division bench, stating that the state government would not allow anyone to use the Maidan without prior approval of the army.?

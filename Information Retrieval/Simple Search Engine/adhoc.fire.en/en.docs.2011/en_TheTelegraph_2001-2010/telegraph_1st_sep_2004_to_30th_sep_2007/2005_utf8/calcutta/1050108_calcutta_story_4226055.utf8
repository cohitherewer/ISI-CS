The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 I was appalled to see the conditions inside Netaji Indoor Stadium during a 

recent visit to watch the Russian Circus on ice. Most of the seats were rusted 

and it spoilt our clothes. The iron beams and the basic structures of the roof 

were also in a pathetic condition. The very sight of the dirty pillars, broken 

concrete floors and chaotic electric lines hanging from the rooftop was disconcerting. 

How can the authorities concerned ignore maintenance of a structure that we Calcuttans 

have been boasting of all these years? Further, to add to our woes, we had to 

stand in a queue for 45 minutes to enter the stadium. Hope the authorities will 

consider setting aside a portion of the rent realised from the Russian Circus 

for revamping the stadium.

 A manhole at the Elgin Road-Allenby crossing remained without a cover for a long time. When I noticed that the civic body had not bothered to cover it for weeks together, I reported the matter to the Forum management. The next time I passed by I noticed that a sturdy cover had been put over it. Doesn?t the Calcutta Municipal Corporation do anything without reminders from the general public?

 The house on Kidderpore Road where Michael Madhusudan Dutt used to live is 

in a shambles. The front portion of the building remains obscured by materials 

dumped by the hawkers. The state government should immediately renovate the poet?s 

house and maintain it as a heritage structure.

 Till a few years back, plenty of flowering plants adorned the parks in the 

city. Even flower shows used to be held on their premises with the advent of winter. 

But due to reasons best known to the authorities, now there are hardly any flower 

gardens in parks and islands at road intersections. At least, this winter, the 

Corporation should plant saplings of flowering trees to restore the beauty of 

the city.

 December 24 was Kreta Suraksha Dibas or Consumers? Day. Though a few consumer 

organisations observe the day, little is done by the authorities to stop vendors 

from cheating the buyers. In many markets the vendors make do with small stones 

instead of proper weights. They should be penalised to root out this malpractice.

 Calcutta has a lesson to learn from Chandernagore in controlling air and noise pollution during pujas.

 Setting a unique example, the Charmandirtala Sri Sri Jagaddhatri Puja committee, in Chandernagore, decided to do away with the usual generators and lamps for its decorative lighting during the immersion procession last Friday. 

 Over the years, the town has made a name for itself in India and abroad for its puja lighting.

 ?This year, we replaced the generators and lamps with two 12-volt car batteries and power-saving LED (light-emitting diode) lamps from Bangalore, respectively. This spared the onlookers the ear-splitting noise and fumes produced by the generators and also brought down the costs,? said Shyamal Sil, a representative of the puja committee.

 ?The new technology is also safer. The earlier method of lighting used to put the electricians at risk,? he explained.

 Sudip Banerjee, chairman of West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB), remarked: ?The effort is definitely appreciable. We will see how the technology can be used in Calcutta.?

 The board?s senior law officer Biswajit Mukherjee has already requested senior environmental engineer Subrata Ghosh ?to inspect the site and examine the issue? so that the technology can be used on a larger scale.

 A local resident pointed out that Chandernagore has always been a front-runner in undertaking initiatives in preserving the environment, especially during festivals.

 The town was the first in the state to effectively curb pollution by misuse of microphones during festivals. It also has the state?s first environment fair to its credit.

 Last year, the Hooghly along Chandernagore had been cleared of the remains of the idols within 12 hours of their immersions.

 ?This year, too, about 100 boys worked overtime, in tandem with the municipal authorities, to ensure that the remnants of the Jagaddhatri idols were removed from the river,? said a member of local club Sabujer Abhijan, which has been a leader in the eco-friendly initiatives.

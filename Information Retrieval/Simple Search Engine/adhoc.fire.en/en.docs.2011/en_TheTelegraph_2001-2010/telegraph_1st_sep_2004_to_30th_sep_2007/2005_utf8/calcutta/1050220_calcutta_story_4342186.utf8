 What does it take to bring the night raiders to a screeching halt, push the sale of food and beverage through the roof and set the dance floor on fire? Two hunks and a babe, in this case. And if Milind Soman is part of this gang, there?s no stopping a mega hit party. 

 The star cast of Jurm sans female lead Lara Dutta was in town on Friday. After the promotional campaign throughout the day, it was time to check out the vibrant nightlife of the city. 

 And so the three stars ? Milind, Gul Panag and Bobby Deol ? decided to shine down on Prince of Cal, the lounge and bar at Sourav?s on Park Street. 

 The threesome entered the address a little before midnight, only to be greeted by hordes of fans who were eagerly waiting to catch a glimpse of the stars. 

 From young kids to teenaged girls, everyone was starry eyed and busy capturing their share of stardom on cell phones. The footfalls kept swelling as the party people dashed off SMSs alerting friends about the presence of the stars at PoC (Prince of Cal, of course!). Requests ranged from a photograph to a peck on the cheek.

 It was clearly Milind?s night as the model-turned actor was mobbed by the female fraternity, right from the entrance to the dance floor (a group of girls literally dragged him along). 

 Bobby and Gul had their own fan following, too, that even followed them to a remote corner of the nightclub. The two preferred to remain seated till they left the place around one in the morning. 

 But the real action was in and around the DJ console where visitors went into a frenzy when Milind gave them a lesson or two in dancing.

 ?Hey, night clubs in Mumbai close down so early. Calcutta really parties late into the night,? smiled the heartthrob. 

 With Bollywood stars in the gallery, the DJ churned out tracks like Kaho na kaho, It?s the time to disco and Bin tere sanam.

 By the time the joyous evening came to an end, everybody, including the stars, seemed to agree that the only missing link to the masti was the man himself. ?Where is the Prince of Calcutta?? was the question of the night.

 Band boom

 The Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur, is celebrating its 68th annual reunion titled Rebeca 2005. The four-day fun fiesta started on February 17 when Bangla bands Bhoomi and Fossils rocked the campus with songs like Tomar dekha nai re, Amar je ki hobe and Telephone. 

 On Friday, eight amateur bands participated in a fierce rock competition. A band called Hobos was crowned winner. 

 But it was left to rock band Euphoria to turn on the heat with a three-hour-long power performance that included everything from Rabindrasangeet to Pink Floyd. 

 Percussionist Bikram Ghosh presented his Rhythmscape on Saturday, followed by a dance performance by Mamata Shankar. ?Rebeca is one of the biggest college fests in the eastern region,? said Arpan Mukherjee, a committee member.

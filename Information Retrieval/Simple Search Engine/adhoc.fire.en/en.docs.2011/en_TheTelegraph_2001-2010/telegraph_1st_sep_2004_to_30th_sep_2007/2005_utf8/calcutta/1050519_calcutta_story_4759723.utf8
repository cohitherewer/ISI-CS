Screen On amp; Off

Cinematic sense amp; sensibility

RITUPARNO GHOSH is always busy, whether on a film or 

between films. With Antarmahal being picked up by AB Corp and the Prosenjit-Konkona 

starrer headed for the floors, he tells Reshmi Sengupta about what has passed 

and whats in store

of Chokher Bali

Chokher Bali and Raincoat were recently 

screened at two prestigious festivals in the US. What kind of a response did they 

get?

Film Fest DC in Washington opened with Raincoat 

and it had a very good response. In fact, it was better there than in India. 

And it was also better than Chokher Bali, which some people might have 

had difficulties with, as it is more culture specific. Several professors from 

George Washington University had dropped by for Chokher Bali. What I found 

interesting was the presence of lots of white people among the audience. Generally, 

Indian film screenings draw audiences of mainly Indian origin.

Chokher Bali was also screened at the 3rd Annual 

South Asia Human Rights Film amp; Video Festival in New York. The screenings 

at both places were followed by interactive sessions where I was flooded with 

questions.

Smithsonian is planning to do a retrospective of my 

work, both for TV and feature films. The package will be screened in New York 

and Washington and thereafter may travel to other places.

Very soon, you will hit the floors for your next 

Bengali film with Prosenjit and Konkona Sen Sharma. What is it about?

It?s about marital infidelity. I haven?t named the 

film yet. There are two unconnected stories, which run simultaneously but merge 

with each other at the end. There are two sets of couples who go through completely 

different situations. So both Prosenjit and Konkona are in double roles. I will 

start shooting sometime in June.

What is the source of the plot?

It?s my own, with just a hint from one of Shirshendu 

Mukhopadhyay?s stories.

Will you be doing Saheb Bibi Ghulam for 

Pritish Nandy Communications?

I have been thinking of doing Saheb Bibi Ghulam 

for several years now. I have been approached by Pritish Nandy Communications 

to do it for them, but I am yet to take a call. Sometime back I heard that Deepa 

Mehta was doing it. I will have to speak to Deepa and clarify matters. But if 

I do the film, I will cast Jisshu (Sengupta) as Bhootnath. Some of our actors 

should also get a chance. I have already sent a DVD of Abar Aranye (Goutam 

Ghose?s film where Jisshu played a pivotal role) to Pritish Nandy. 

If you do Saheb Bibi Ghulam, will there 

be pressure on you to make it a Bollywood period film, say on the lines of a Devdas?

If I do this film, I will do it my own way. I do not 

disregard the commercial ingredients of a Bollywood film but I don?t think I will 

be able to use them in a meaningful way. Producers who approach me surely have 

my film-making sensibility in mind.

If you look back at Raincoat now, your first 

Hindi feature film, do you find any flaws?

I see Raincoat as my 10th feature film. Just 

that I happened to make it in Hindi instead of Bengali doesn?t mean that it was 

made in a different way. Since the budget was limited, Raincoat recovered 

its costs. It wasn?t a business loss. But the film evoked a better reaction in 

north India than in Mumbai.

The one thing I realised is that the pace has been 

a factor in Raincoat. It was a departure from Bollywood films and Mumbai 

audiences are impatient; they have problems relating to a film where nothing much 

happens. There isn?t any chain of incidents happening one after another. For instance, 

Black, too, is an indoor film but the pace never lets you get tired. Even 

some people who had liked Chokher Bali very much have found Raincoat 

a little sluggish. 

 Abhishek Bachchan and Raima Sen in Antarmahal

Talking of Black, it too was screened at 

Film Fest DC?

Yes, it was? And something embarrassing happened too. 

During one of my interactive sessions, an audience member claimed that Black 

was a copy of The Miracle Worker. He wanted my views on Bollywood copying 

Hollywood but not admitting it. I hadn?t seen The Miracle Worker and so 

didn?t know what to say. Later, I saw the film and indeed found that Black 

had striking similarities with it.

What other films have you got lined up?

I will be doing the film on The Mahabharata by 

this year-end. Then I have one Hindi film to be produced by Arindam Chaudhuri. 

It?s Arindam?s story, based on a real-life incident, and I have liked it.

What about the film starring Amitabh Bachchan which 

is long due?

The project is still on? I will do it sometime later.

When will Antarmahal release? 

It will be released in the next few months by Amitabh 

Bachchan?s AB Corp and producer Vasu Bhagnani. Meanwhile, Antarmahal has 

been chosen in the competition section for this year?s Locarno Film Festival.

 Frenzy for fashion

 A late, lazy start to this Sunday morning was not an option for the fashionistas of Calcutta. Women of all age groups, and some men as well, queued up outside the Oberoi Grand ballroom door as early as 9 am, just so that they could grab the best of Stylefile Exhibition 2005.

 Once the doors were thrown open dot at 11 am, the ballroom turned into a crowded festive bazaar, with hardly any elbow room. By time the December 4 clock struck 1 pm, most designers had sold out about 70 per cent of their collections.

 Said Sumedha Saraogi, co-organiser of the biggest annual fashion and lifestyle event of the city: The response exceeded our expectations. And I am really happy that the art works are also being very well appreciated. We were a little apprehensive about that since this is the first time we introduced the art aspect of the exhibition in Calcutta.

 Designers showcasing at the one-day exhibition were Priyadarshini Rao, Sabina Singh of Horn OK Please, Anjali Kalia, Sabyasachi Mukherjee, Kiran Uttam Ghosh, Kavita Bhartia and Gauri Bajoria. Anamika Khanna, who was supposed to participate, backed out just prior to the event, but made her presence felt as an enthusiastic shopper.

 The designers showcased their fall-winter 2005-06 lines and on offer was an eclectic mix of western wear ? loads of skirts of every shape and size, jackets, shirts and tops ? as well as ethnic saris and salwar kameezes.

 The best thing about this exhibition is that each designers signature look is very different from the other and hence it caters to people of varied tastes. Also, since this kind of an event doesnt seem to be too common in Calcutta, it looks like people were eagerly waiting for it, observed Mumbai-based Priyadarshini, whose mens wear shirts and womens western wear were moving fast.

 Those who presented their art on objects d art were Paresh Maity, Chandra Bhattacharjee, Shuvaprasanna, Sunil Padwal, Arzan Khambatta, Prashant Harlekar, Rajeshree Thakker and Shipra Bhattacharya.

 Their art featured on home d?cor pieces like wooden chests, platters, vases, wall hangings, tumblers, bowls, candle stands, mirrors, coasters, cabinets, magazine racks, pen stands and even bins.

 The Stylefile Exhibition this time is a very new experience for Calcuttans and Im happy that they responded so well. Fashion always does well in Calcutta, but its good to see that people are going for the art works too, said Preeti Goenka, co-partner of Stylefile.

 She picked Sabyasachi as the showstealer among the designers, quickly adding that almost all the designers were doing very good business.

 And true, while big names like Sabyasachi, Kiran, Priyadarshini and Sabina were drawing maximum footfalls, newcomer Gauri from Calcutta too wasnt left far behind. Its really an honour to showcase on the same platform with designers like Sabyasachi, and I am overwhelmed with the response my clothes are getting. The jackets and skirts are flying off the racks, said Gauri, a debutante at Stylefile.

 Even the veterans, it seemed, were quite overwhelmed with the fashion frenzy. Observed Kiran: Its surprising to see that the more adventurous and daring garments are selling really well. From cropped tops to tunics and draped skirts, people are lapping it up. In fact, many of the women dont even know how to wrap the draped skirts, but they are all enthusiastic about experimentation.

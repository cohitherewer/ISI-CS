The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Small Talk

 If its 40 and counting on 

 earth, its a free fall in the skies. Map heaven and 

 earth as you enter the netherworlds to cool off this weekend.

 Beat the heat

 You are hit by a heat wave and 

 you better know it to justify your itsy-bitsy wardrobe. 

 As you send the Mercury soaring higher, flaunt a little 

 GK as well to balance things out. If you want some help 

 with the vital (brain) stats, pick up the tip of why this 

 is called a heat wave (five degrees above normal, it is). 

 And if they raise eyebrows at the endless row of beer bottles 

 on your table, wink the monsoons being delayed for at least 

 10 days excuse to floor them further. Given the prediction 

 of poor monsoons during the months of June and July in any 

 case, you can go right ahead and order some more. 

 Sky is falling

 Dont be surprised if boasting 

 about your latest trip to Bangkok only elicits bored expressions 

 and the odd polite smile. If you want to flaunt your new-found 

 riches, go to Goa or camp at Kashmir instead. But if you 

 would rather show off the smart traveller in you, plan aloud 

 about your forthcoming trip to Southeast Asian countries 

 or even as far away as London or New York. With the price 

 in the sky plummeting faster than ever before, its 

 cool to exchange notes and tips on your latest incursion 

 into the skies. Imagine a round trip to Kuala Lumpur for 

 Rs 8,000, London for Rs 24,999 and New York for Rs 39,999! 

 Also zoom in on the cause and effect theory of jet fuel 

 prices falling and Air Deccan, Singapore Airlines and Spice 

 Jet entering the city airspace to send the prices on another 

 nosedive. 

 Puff punch

 And there is no missing out on 

 the smoke in the fire poor Bollywood has come under for 

 supposedly promoting puff pleasures on screen. 

 Have a war of words as the debate rages on banning smoking 

 on screen that all but threatens to wipe off the ubiquitous 

 presence of the mafia in masala flicks. Lets 

 see how threatening the dadas look without the smoke 

 rings in the air.

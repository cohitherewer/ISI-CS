The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Speed claims four in road safety week

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Traffic Safety Week kicked off on Monday with a series of accidents, leaving four people dead and over half-a-dozen injured in the city and its adjoining areas.

 While a Matador mowed down a shopper in Taratala in the morning, a private bus ran over a middle-aged man in Hatibagan in the afternoon. 

 On Kona Expressway in Jagachcha (Howrah), two persons died and three were critically injured in a collision between two Matadors.

 In yet another mishap, Ranjita Begum, riding pillion on a motorcycle, was knocked down by an unidentified vehicle at the AJC Bose Road-Alimuddin Street crossing. Ranjita, in her mid-30s, was taken to Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital, where her condition was stated to be critical. 

 The Hatibagan accident, which occurred a few metres from Burtola police station, resulted from rash driving.

 The victim, 55-year-old Manmatha De, was crossing Bidhan Sarani when a private bus on route 219 was moving at breakneck speed to overtake a Howrah-bound minibus.

 ?Both the buses seemed to bore down on De, and in a moment, he was dragged under the private bus. His body was completely crushed and it was difficult to recognise him,? said an eyewitness. 

 The driver of the killer bus fled after abandoning his vehicle at Hedua.

 Soon after the incident, residents of the neighbourhood blocked the Bidhan Sarani-Brindaban Bose Lane crossing, demanding immediate posting of traffic guards on the spot. 

 ?There is a school in the locality and we have repeatedly asked the police to post a traffic guard here. But our appeals have fallen on deaf ears,? said local resident Sarban Singh.

 Officer-in-charge of Burtola police station Apurba Kumar Som Chowdhury said the residents? plea had been forwarded to the traffic department. ?Road accidents, however, will occur unless stringent measures are taken against indisciplined drivers,? he said.

 The Taratala accident, which claimed the life of 70-year-old Gurudayal Roy, took place at 6.30 am. 

 Police said a Matador rammed into him from behind while he was crossing a road near a local market.

 He was immediately taken to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The driver fled, leaving behind the killer vehicle. 

 Those killed in the Howrah accident have been identified as Israffi Mullick, 23, and Jasimuddin Sheikh, 22. 

 Those injured are Surabuddin Sardar, Sheikh Sadik and Azizul Mullick, all aged between 25 and 30. They have been admitted to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital and SSKM Hospital. 

 ?The killer Matadors have been impounded and the drivers arrested,? said Howrah superintendent of police Mihir Kumar Bhattacharya.

 According to senior police officers, the vehicles were moving so fast that the drivers lost control while crossing the Santragachhi bridge, an accident-prone spot.

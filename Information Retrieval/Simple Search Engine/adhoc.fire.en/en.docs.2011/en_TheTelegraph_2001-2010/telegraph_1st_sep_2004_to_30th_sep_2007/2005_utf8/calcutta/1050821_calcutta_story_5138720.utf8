 More is the Mantra 

Three-in-one

 In between chopping reels for film-makers, Rabiranjan Moitra had taken time off to strike out on his own with the spooky film Mantra. And while he was mulling his second celluloid move, an old friend from Bollywood asked him to help out with a twin task ? head the second unit of a blockbuster waiting to hit the floors and also shoot the making of the film.

 Later this month, the city-based film editor will fly to Mumbai to join the star team of Vidhu Vinod Chopra?s period piece Yagna. From there to Rajasthan in early September, where Chopra will camp on the sandy expanse with a 200-member crew.

 Featuring Amitabh Bachchan as an ageing guardian of a royal household, and also starring Saif Ali Khan, Sanjay Dutt, Jackie Shroff, Vidya Balan and Raima Sen, Yagna marks Chopra?s return to direction after Mission Kashmir and after a gap of five years.

 ?Vidhu Vinod Chopra, Raj Kumar Hirani and I were all batchmates at FTII Pune. Vinod had asked me to edit Parineeta but I couldn?t due to prior commitments. I was there with Hirani during the first cut of Munnabhai MBBS but that was more of a help to a friend. This time, I have been officially assigned the job of shooting the making of Yagna and also being the second unit director for the film,? says Moitra, whose Mantra has received a lukewarm response at the box office.

 A parallel second unit is required when a crew works on a very tight schedule, on location and involving a combination of artistes, explains Moitra. ?Vinod will keep shooting the main portions with three or more artistes, while I will take charge of the leftover shots. For instance, there will be shots or angles requiring only one artiste, say Sanjay, which I will can. This is needed to finish the film within a time frame.? 

 The team will shoot in the forts and deserts of Bikaner and Jaisalmer in a span of 50 days.

 Yet, it?s the making of Yagna that Moitra is more excited about because the film is targeted at the ?international audience?. ?It?s all of 90 minutes and minus any songs. The background score is by Shantanu Moitra.? Given the heavy-duty cast line-up of Yagna, Moitra?s curtain-raiser should be well worth a watch.

 For many theatre lovers in town, Friday evening was meant to be spent at Gyan Manch, where Four Women and a Trio was being staged.

 A Spandan theatre production in association with Patton, it involved three plays with an all-woman cast comprising Renu Roy, Anashua Mazumdar, Punam Singh and Debjani Roy.

 First up was The Last Flame, written by Indrashish Lahiri, and directed and enacted by Anashua Mazumdar.

 The vignette dealt with the awakening of a woman, Bonolata Mitra (played by Anashua), who was made to think that her husband Animesh, his whims and fancies were the be-all and end-all of her life ? till his death.

 Instead of anguish, what she feels is a sense of great release causing her to break into the song ?rodono bhora e bosonto?. This very ecstasy takes her on an inward journey where there is a story untold and a song unsung. The character of Bonolata is brought to life wonderfully by Anashua, but loud music to overemphasise particular scenes could have been avoided.

 The second play, a 25-minute one-act, was The Divorce. Written by Nag Bodas and directed by Lee-Alison Sibley, this was set in a courtroom where the protagonist Indira Chowdhury (Renu) was seen making an impassioned plea to the court to grant her a divorce in somewhat unusual circumstances ? after the death of her husband. Her plaint ? the ideological fall from grace of her late husband, a politician.

 The winner of the evening ? if one went by audience response ? was the finale. A complete contrast to the serious drama of the first two, Going Home had the audience in splits.

 Written by the celebrated American playwright Neil Simon and directed by Punam Singh, the musical score was by Dhruv Mukherjee.

 A humorous yet touching dramatic piece, it focused on the sharing and understanding between a widowed mother (Punam) and her married daughter (Debjani) who meet in transit in London.

 What follows is a hilarious talk session between the two, with the daughter trying to fix up her mother with a gentleman she met on the flight.

 Besides the acting, one thing that made each of the acts was the use of minimal props on stage to portray a stark reality.

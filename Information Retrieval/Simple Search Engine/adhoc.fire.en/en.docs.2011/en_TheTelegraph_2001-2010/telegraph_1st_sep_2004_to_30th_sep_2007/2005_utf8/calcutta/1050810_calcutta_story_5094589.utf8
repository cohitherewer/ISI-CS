 Extortion tag on school 

Magazine pressure

 - Child made to stand outside class for not buying souvenir

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A seven-year-old boy was forced to stand outside his classroom all day on Tuesday for failing to buy a school magazine.

 Immediately after the incident came to light, guardians and local residents rushed to the school in Birati, on the city?s northern fringes, and laid siege, demanding an apology from the authorities. 

 Trouble broke out at Shanti Kid Academy, a private secondary school, when Subrata Das, a railway employee, went to the school to fetch his son Samrat.

 He found Samrat, usually a cheerful boy, standing outside the classroom in tears. ?The teachers won?t let me in. They said they were following orders,? said the weeping child.

 ?He was punished because I refused to buy a school magazine for Rs 25. We had told the authorities that we would buy it later, but they, obviously, were in no mood to listen and decided to make him stand throughout the day,? said Subrata Das.

 Subrata then got in touch with other guardians and they gheraoed the school, demanding an explanation. They shouted slogans against the school. The situation would have taken a turn for the worse unless police had arrived along with Sachin Sarkar, chairman of North Dum Dum Municipality.

 ?The school demands money from us on one pretext or the other, apart from the school fees. Sometimes, they do it for a cultural function or for souvenirs. We are tired and will not tolerate this any more,? said an angry guardian, A. Mukherjee. 

 The school authorities refused to comment. ?We will not talk to anybody in this regard,? was all a woman at the residence of school headmistress Sweta Bhattacharya would say.

 Subrata Das alleged that a few days earlier, the school authorities had taken Rs 40 from all guardians to publish a magazine and for a rhyme competition.

 ?I told the authorities that I have money problems now and will buy the magazine later. But they refused to listen and some officers threatened to transfer my son,? Das alleged.

 ?The 60-page magazine is packed with advertisements. It is supposed to carry literary works of our wards. But hardly anything worthwhile has appeared in it. Why should we be forced to buy it?? asked Tamal Bhattacharya, a guardian.

 Later, police and local political leaders managed to persuade the guardians to withdraw their protest. ?I have spoken to both the school authorities and the guardians. Things will resolve in a day or two,? said the North Dum Dum Municipality chairman. 

 On the mushrooming of private schools in the area in violation of norms, Dulal Das, inspector of schools (secondary), North 24-Parganas, said: ?Some schools manage to procure a trade licence from the local municipality and start functioning. We can only interfere if it is a government-sponsored or aided school?

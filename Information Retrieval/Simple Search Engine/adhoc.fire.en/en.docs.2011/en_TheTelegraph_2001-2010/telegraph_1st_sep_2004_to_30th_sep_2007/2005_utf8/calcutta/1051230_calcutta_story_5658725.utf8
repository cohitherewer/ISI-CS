 The modern era of economic reforms and globalisation brings in its wake certain changes in society, which, unfortunately, are not always favourable to its development. Highlighting the drawbacks of liberalisation in a society where the majority of citizens are poor and unlettered, Gobardanga Nakshas production Ghorar Dimer Gappo offers a look at some of the practical aspects that need to be considered prior to introducing programmes of socio-economic development. In the play, Gana, Pada and Mana represent the country?s poor, who toil hard to make ends meet. With no aspiration for a better future, they barely manage to sustain themselves in the present. The village priest represents the opportunists in society and betrays the inner pretensions of our political leaders. As the story progresses, it becomes clear that the naive, unrealistic dreams of the villagers are responsible for their downfall, thus proving the utter futility of launching reforms in the village. Direction: Ashis Das.

 Event: Play in Bengali, Ghorar Dimer Gappo, produced by Gobardanga Naksha 

When: Today at 6 pm 

Where: Bharatiyam, EZCC, IB 201 Salt Lake

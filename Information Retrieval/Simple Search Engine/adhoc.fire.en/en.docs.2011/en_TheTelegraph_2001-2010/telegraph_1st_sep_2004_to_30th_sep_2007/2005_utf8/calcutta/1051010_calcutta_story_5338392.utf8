The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Facelift for 100-yr-old

 - Station 

to go global 

 SANJAY MANDAL

Station building: 100 years old

No. of platforms: 21 (another to be added)

Passenger platforms: 19

Parcel platforms: 2

Daily footfall: 1.1 million

Trains: More than 300 daily

 A sprawling pedestrian concourse, escalators, conveyor belts and food courts ? Howrah railway station is poised for a major facelift. The station building, which will celebrate its centenary later this year, will undergo the biggest renovation since its inception.

 Rites, technical consultants of Indian Railways, is conducting a survey of Howrah, New Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai stations for the remodelling project. The Railways Land Development Authority is likely to be the implementing authority of the project. ?Once completed, Howrah station will have the look of an international airport. It can compete with any international railway station,? claimed Shyam Kumar, general manager, Eastern Railway.

 ?The details of the project will be worked out soon,? Kumar said. According to initial plans, the old sheds on the platforms will be demolished and an additional floor created for the new pedestrian concourse. 

 Platforms will be connected to the passenger walkway with a series of escalators. A passenger crossing platforms will take the escalator and walk to the desired platform. 

 Conveyor belts will be set up for clearance of passenger luggage. The walkway will have modern toilets, food courts, a shopping complex and other facilities. ?The spaces will be used commercially to raise funds for maintenance,? Kumar explained. 

 ?The new plan will provide more space for passenger movement. The separate pedestrian walkway will have a lot of extra space, as there will be no tracks,? Kumar stated. 

 Howrah station accounts for a footfall of more than one million daily. However, with plans to increase the number of coaches in long-distance trains to 24, there will be a sharp increase in the passengers and the authorities fear that the station will get clogged unless steps were taken.

 With railways facing stiff competition from airlines and roadways, the authorities are planning several measures to attract passengers, the remodelling being one of those. 

 However, the building will remain unchanged. ?We have applied for heritage status with Unesco and the building will be kept intact,? Kumar assured. 

Kumar has requested the Calcutta Port Trust authorities 

to clear land adjacent to the Hooghly in front of Howrah station. ?I have proposed 

a green verge that will give the station complex a better look,? he said. There 

are a number of unauthorised food marts and structures on the bank.

 Calcutta Column

 The office premises of the armed forces? 5th Battalion in Maniktala has turned into a junkyard. Discarded vehicles are kept on the premises, along with roadworthy Calcutta Police vans. The situation is similar at Ultadanga police station. A long stretch of the road in front of the thana is occupied with run-down vehicles. The vehicles should either be sold off as scrap or maintained properly. Isn?t this a form of encroachment upon public property? When the army and the law enforcers themselves flout rules, won?t the general public get the wrong message. Law-makers and law-enforcers should not become law-breakers. The municipal authorities should stop the government agencies and others from illegally taking over public space.

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation is now considering a ban on the sale of polybags in the city. Discarded polybags and plastic waste are indeed a menace to the environment, but so are vehicles that run on conventional fuel. Are we to ban all motorvehicles as well? Banning the sale and use of a commodity may not bring down its consumption. Instead, the people who dispose of polythene bags and plastics along roads should be pulled up. In some countries, polybags are totally banned. The governments there have thoughtfully introduced alternatives like paper and cloth bags. Why can?t our government think on these lines?

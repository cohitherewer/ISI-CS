 Pujas for most Calcutta women is the time for saris, even if many of them dont think too much of tripping around in the traditional nine yards through the year. For these few days, its quite a challenge to blend in with the ritualistic ambience of the Pujas and yet make a fashion statement.

 Keeping this in mind, Raj Gharana Saris launched its festive collection at the Park Street showroom recently. 

 Apart from extensive use of gota pallu designs, the festive range is embellished with sequins, glitters, Parsi and Kashmiri embroidery.

 The saris come in bright pastels and contrasting shades and are teamed with heavy blouses with butta work on the shoulders, which is the latest rage.

 Also hot this year, and part of the Raj Gharana collection, are Kancheepuram saris with Madhubani work, jute handloom and cotton-blended saris with jute embroidery.

 Making this line stand out are innovative embroidery, contrasting colours and off-beat patterns. 

 The fabrics used range from crepe and georgette to chiffon mixed with cotton from different parts of the country ? Kancheepuram silk from Tamil Nadu, Valkalam from Uttar Pradesh, Ikkat from Andhra Pradesh, Bandhini, Kathiawad and Koras from Gujarat, Benarasi silk from Benaras, Patola from Rajkot and Mysore georgette from Karnataka. 

 Prices of the saris start from Rs 2,000.

 Trendy touch

 Resplendent, innovative and artistic are words that describe the latest range of ornaments on display at Sawansukha Jewellers.

 Bamboo, wood and coconut shells form the base of this nature-inspired collection of diamond, gold and stone-engraved jewellery.

 The pieces, which received rave reviews at the International Jewellery Show in Mumbai a couple of months ago, are now available at the Sawansukha showroom on 3B, Little Russel Street. 

 My father Rupchand Sawansukha and myself have been mulling over this unique concept for quite some time. We wanted to create something that a woman would not just buy for a particular occasion but a timeless classic that she would want to indulge in, says co-owner Siddhartha Sawansukha, a gemologist and jewellery designer in his own right. 

 Bamboo, wood and coconut shells have great potential in jewellery, adds Siddhartha.

 Innovation is the key to the entire collection. For the bamboo bracelet, weighing 175 g, the bamboo has been thinned out, polished from inside and lacquered with an emerald green coat to ensure durability of colour.

 It is then adorned with intricate designs in white gold, semi-precious stones and diamonds. 

 Coconut shells have been used as the base for a pretty pendant that comes with matching earrings, too. Both are enhanced with gold and diamond floral motifs.

 A heavy necklace with an unconventional base of wood is stunning with all the filigree work, gold and diamonds.

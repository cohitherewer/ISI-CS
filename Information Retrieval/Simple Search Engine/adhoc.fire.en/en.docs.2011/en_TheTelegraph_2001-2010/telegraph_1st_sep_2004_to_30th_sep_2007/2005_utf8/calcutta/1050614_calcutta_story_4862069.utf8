 An unusual cure

 Delving into the deep recesses of the complex human psyche, Mangaliks production, Haroon-al Rashid, undertakes a comic exploration that seeks to understand human psychology and uncover reasons for apparently eccentric human behaviour. Written by Mohit Chattopadhyay, the play introduces us to Jadupati Biswas, an elderly man with a gentle and sympathetic nature. His wife, Charu, is anxious and distressed as her husband suffers from strange hallucinations. Imagining himself to be Haroon-al Rashid, the legendary Khalifa of Baghdad who was renowned for his munificence, Jadupati also behaves charitably, giving away his money and possessions to those less fortunate. Thinking her husband to be mentally deranged, Charu seeks her brother?s advice, who recommends a psychiatrist to handle Jadupati?s case. What follows is pure entertainment for the audience, as it is baffling and mystifying for Charu and her brother. With a surprising revelation as its climax, the play serves as an eye-opening indictment on modern-day fears and insecurities. Directed by Samir Biswas, who also plays Jadupati.

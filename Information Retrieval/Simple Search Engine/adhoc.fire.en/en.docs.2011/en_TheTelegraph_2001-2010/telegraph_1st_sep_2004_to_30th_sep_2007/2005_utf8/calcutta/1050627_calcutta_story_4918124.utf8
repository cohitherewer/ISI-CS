The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Health tourism takes flight out

 - Fare cut, medicare hassle send Bangla patients to SE Asia

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 Mushfiqar Rehman, of Dhaka, has been to Calcutta several times for treatment. But now he opts for Singapore, and his friends prefer Bangkok, or Penang, in Malaysia.

 With airfares to Southeast Asia in a free fall and the reputation of some of Calcutta?s clinics taking a beating, a chunk of Bangladeshi patients, who once powered the city?s healthcare industry, is now flying to other destinations.

 Over the past six months, a city-based agent has, on an average, been booking flights to Southeast Asia for 70-80 Bangla nationals per month, said Anil Punjabi, chairman (east) of the Travel Agents Federation of India. ?A majority of them are going for treatment, while some want to seek a second opinion after being disillusioned by the standard of treatment at city clinics.?

 Low airfares from the city prompt most Bangladeshis to book their flights from here.

 Despite the prospect of the Rs 400-crore Bangla patients? market slipping away, the Association of Hospitals of Eastern India (AHEI), a conglomerate of 12 top city hospitals, is not pressing the panic button.

 ?It?s true that a section of Bangla patients is opting for Singapore and Bangkok, but this has lot to do with the credibility of the middle-level nursing homes here and aggressive marketing by Southeast Asia hospitals,? said Sajal Dutta, AHEI president.

 However, to revert the trend, the association has held several meetings amongst its members and with the government to hammer out a competitive medical tourism package for Bengal. ?The government is working on a proposal. A meeting in this regard will be held on Saturday,? Dutta said.

 Doctors believe setting a benchmark and improving the standard of healthcare will bring back patients from Bangladesh. ?We believe transparency in the billing procedure and an improved healthcare will solve the problem,? offered cancer surgeon Gautam Mukhopadhyay, who had been in Mumbai for several years.

 ?The problem of transparency ails the middle-level clinics, where a major chunk of Bangladeshis used to be admitted,? he added. The clinics accounted for over Rs 250 crore of the Rs 400-crore that the Bangla market generated.

 Punjabi, however, believes the additional lure of a vacation in Singapore or Bangkok is drawing the average Bangla patient to these places.

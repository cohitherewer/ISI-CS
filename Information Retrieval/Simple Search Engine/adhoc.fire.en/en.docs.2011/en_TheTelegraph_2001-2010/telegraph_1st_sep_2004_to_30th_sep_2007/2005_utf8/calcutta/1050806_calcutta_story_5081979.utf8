 If a musical on John Lennon is delving into the life of the legend, another rock great and almost a Lennon contemporary is foraying into his first opera.

 Pink Floyd?s Roger Waters recently presented excerpts from ?a Ira, his three-act opera about the French Revolution. It will be performed live for the first time at the Santa Cecilia Auditorium in Rome on November 17.

 ?a Ira is set during early years of the French Revolution; with characters like Marie Antoinette, Louis XVI, and Marie Marianne ? ?the Voice of Liberty, Reason, and the Republic?. It uses a circus as ?a central theatrical framing device and metaphor?, according to a statement released about the opera earlier this year.

 ?It?s really about revolution in the broadest sense,? Waters has said. ?It?s about change, and personal change; we each have within us the potential for republic.?

 The ambitious project first came to Waters back in 1989, when French songwriter Etienne Roda-Gil brought him a libretto for the French Revolution-inspired piece.

 The piece has a small connection with Pink Floyd?s The Wall as well. Waters conceded that he is ?sort of reiterating The Wall? and its themes of ?powerlessness in the face of loss?.

 The rocker also said that many people find opera to be intimidating because they think it?s not meant for them, but only for the wealthy or the elite. The irony, he noted, is that opera was originally the art form of the masses.

 In Wales and London, the myriad moods of Lady Macbeth shining through kathak, Manipuri and Bharatanatyam intrigued the audience enough to return for a demonstration on the making of the piece, Crossings. Ranan, the dance company steered by kathak exponent Vikram Iyengar, was invited by Centre for Performance Research, Aberystwyth, to conduct a summer workshop. Iyengar had modified the piece for the performances in London and Wales, including weaving in Lord Duncan?s murder and its aftermath. 

 Says he: ?The murder scenes are very quiet with a little bit of dance movements. There is more of an undercurrent of percussion and music. While one performer portrayed the murderess, another depicted the conscience. There was one who was broken and another who could carry on and all this finally led to the climactic point. We focussed on how we could use dance to carry the plot forward. We tried to think dance in terms of theatre.?

 Saffron, the pan-Indian speciality restaurant at The Park, is hosting a kebab and biryani festival till December 11. And this one stands out from the run-of-the-mill food promotions at every other eatery with its grand assortment of biryanis, tikkas and raitas on offer.

 A lot of research has gone into the festival menu. We did not want to compromise on the authenticity and each item is very distinct from the other, says chef Rajiv Khullar.

 Chettinad Paneer Tikka, Dahi Ke Kebab, Arbi Ki Sheek, Teen Mirch Jhingha, Malabar Fish Tikka, Kursani Murgh and Khufia Sheek?The tikka spread covers 36 options. They are served along with coconut, pudina and dhania chutneys. 

 The delectable biryani spread boasts no less than 19 exotic varieties of this Mughlai speciality. Non-vegetarians can gorge on Vindaloo Gosht Biryani, Kashmiri Mutanjan, Kareli Biryani, South Indian Chicken Biryani, Samundari Biryani and Elish Machher Biryani. 

 Vegetarians can pamper themselves with Zaika Biryani, Vilayti Subzi Biryani and Teen Rajmah Ki Biryani, to name just a few. 

 The biryani is accompanied by raita that again comes in 10 varieties like Bhuna Pyaaz Ka Raita, Apple Cinnamon Raita, Tandoori Aloo Raita, Methi Raita and Narial Malai Raita.

 Desert delight

 Large brass swords, colourful glass bangles and vibrant bandhni drapes meet the eye, while lilting sounds of traditional Rajasthani music excite the eardrums ? the ongoing Rajasthani food festival at The Kenilworth recreates the feel of the desert land quite delightfully.

 Called Apno Rajasthan, the festival at The Marble Room is on till December 3 at the Little Russell Street address.

 The food with its distinct flavour is an assortment of the rich and the more popular Rajasthani delicacies. For authenticity we have brought in three chefs from Rajasthan for the festival, says Subir Das, assistant F amp;B manager of the hotel.

 One can start with Papad Mangori Soup or Chhaj and move on to the vada section that includes Fatehpur Dahi Vada and Aloo Kanji.

 The salad section offers Dry Moth, Choki Mircha and Aloo Bhuji.

 For the main course one can pick from a wide variety of subzis like Dal Bati Churma, Jodhpuri Aloo Dum, Rajasthani Gatta, Lal Chana Paneer and Pakori Kadi.

 They are accompanied by your choice of rice and rotis. You also have a selection of papads that include Moong Papad, Aloo Papad and Chana Papad. 

 Dal Ka Halwa, Malpua and Kesaria Jalebi make for the sweet ending. 

 One can also opt for a pre-plated thali comprising a shorba, salad, vada, four subzis, roti, pulao, meetha, papad, pickle and chutney.

 The thali is priced at Rs 325.

 Student fare

 To cash in on the citys winter carnival spirit, Institute of Advanced Management in Salt Lake will be hosting Khaddyotsav 05, a fun-filled food affair with a difference. 

 To be held at the Millennium Park on December 8, 9 and 10, the festival attempts to showcase the culinary brilliance of students of the institute.

 A preview of the event was held at the institute premises last week, where students Sammer Vali and Shayonara Bardhan dished out exotic delicacies under the supervision of the culinary department faculty.

 The platter was a gourmets delight with European, Mediterranean and innovative Bengali (Abol Tabol) cuisines coming together.

 The European spread comprised Spicy Sausages, Potato Sesame Fingers, Chickpea Risoles and much more, while the Mediterranean starters included the Spicy Sheesh Tauk, Lamb Salona and Paella Marinera. 

 The innovative Bengali fare had surprises like Kumro Potash (stuffed steamed vegetables with mustard), Hore Koro Komba (paneer balls in chholar dal) and Hojoborolo (shukto with white sauce).

 To end on a sweet note, the dessert spread pampered guests with Tartlets, Blackforest Brownies, Umali, Amer Guto (batterfried amshotto) and Ki Kando (shoux pastry covered with jam topping). 

 But the evening had much more to offer than just food. The place was turned into a fairytale world where one had to enter through Rapunzels tower to be greeted by fictional figures.

 Bagha with his mammoth dhol, butter sculptures of dragons and dinosaurs in the centre and the Harry Potter bar completed the magical ambience.

 The evening drew to a close with two rounds of a fashion show, a dance performance to the beats of Arabic music and a live magic show.

 Oriental affair

 Pan Asian, the Oriental eatery at ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton amp; Towers, is playing host to Feast of the East, a festival offering delicacies from the far eastern countries.

 Cooking up the festive fare is a special guest at the hotel ?Chef Liang Xiao Qiug, a Chinese cookery expert from the Great Wall Sheraton in Beijing. The chef is also famed for his occasional visits to cook up delicacies at the Grand Maratha Sheraton amp; Towers in Mumbai.

 The menu at the festival predominantly features Chinese, with a blend of Asian Hot Pots, Thai, Laksa from Malaysia, Khawswe from Myanmar and Haemol Jongol, a Korean seafood Hot Pot soup.

 Said Liang on his second visit to Calcutta: I have put together food from different parts of China to suit the taste buds of Calcuttans. However, I have left it mostly authentic, except for a little addition of sauces. Calcuttans are known for their appreciation of good food and I am sure they will love what we are bringing them.

 Some of Liangs signature dishes include Dan Dan Noodle Soup, Dim Sums like Xha Xie Qian (shrimp and crab stuffed in crab claws and deep fried), stir fries and grills like Shi Shu Cho Dai Zi (scallops with seasonal vegetables) and Kao Mi Zhi Ji (barbecue honey chicken, Nanjing style).

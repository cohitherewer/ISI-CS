 All in the family

 In a world where material wealth is considered the yardstick of success in life, there is no place for emotional bonding, even within the family. This is the theme of Mukhomukhis latest production, Aarohan. A family drama with a sinister plot, it shocks us into the realisation that natural human virtues are all but dead in a society that thrives on lust for power and money. The play confronts us with a family of siblings, in which the sister, Madhumita, conspires to rob her brothers of the wealth they have acquired from their business ventures. Such is her greed for money that not even her husband?s failing health can restrain her from her evil designs. No less a match for her is her brother Tarakdas, who, too, does not hesitate to resort to dishonest, corrupt means to secure his ends. Full of dark, Machiavellian intrigues, Aarohan brings us face-to-face with the bitter, savage face of humanity. Drama, direction and acting: Soumitra Chattapadhyay.

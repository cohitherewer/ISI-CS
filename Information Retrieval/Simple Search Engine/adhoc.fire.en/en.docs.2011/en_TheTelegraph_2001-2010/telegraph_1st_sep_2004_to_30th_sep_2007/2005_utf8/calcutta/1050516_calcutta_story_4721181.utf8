 Learn a little about robotics this summer, or keep it cool on ice, instead of whiling away the holidays. Or indulge your secret passion and learn to shake a leg in style or exercise your vocal chords. Or discover latent creative talents by trying a hand at cartooning or computer animation. All this and much more, just for toddlers, tweens and teens.

 Summer workshops and camps are no longer only limited-edition events. They?re full-fledged extravaganzas, catering to multiple needs, talents and age groups, keeping the kids occupied and helping them have oodles of fun while learning new skills. 

 Music, dance, art, craft, theatre and creative writing might be pass?, but there are plenty of workshops around, developing these skills. Some with a twist. 

 Like the workshop on the graphic novel, digital film-making, storytelling, film appreciation, etc, at Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre and British Council, in the Magic Pencil series, or the camps on folk art by traditional artists at the Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre in Salt Lake. 

 Catching on like wildfire are the ones off the beaten track, like aeromodelling, rock and rope climbing, memory skills, stilt-walking and textile printing at The Heritage School. And ice-skating at Clown Town. Both The Heritage School and Clown Town have pick-up and drop-off facilities for participants.

 ?The time is too short to make the kids really good at ice-skating, but a summer camp is like a testing ground. If they really like it, they can pursue it later,? explains Sanjay Maheshwari of Clown Town.

 It?s robotics, astronomy, life science and chemistry with a touch of reality and innovation at Birla Industrial and Technological Museum. Even Padatik Dance Centre has classes on maths made easy. Calcutta School of Music allows musical talents to come to the fore, with training in several different instruments.

 If Satya Anusandhan (Gurukul) in Narendrapur has a five-day camp on self-development, then Crossword bookstore has a children?s festival till June 5, with the screening of animated movies, puppet shows, painting competitions, claymate and Scrabble competitions and craft workshops. 

 Individual institutions, from Montessories to senior schools, have summer activities lined up for students. That?s apart from establishments that have regularly been providing holiday activities for kids, like Birla Academy (glass-painting, terracotta, mask-making?) and Nehru Children?s Museum (painting and tabla). 

 Even youngsters with disabilities have a platform for creative expression. Arunima, a centre for training, integration and vocational education for people with impairment, will organise a camp from June 2 to 12 on song, dance, mime, art, craft, etc.

 Thoughtshop Foundation doesn?t have summer camps for youngsters, but student volunteers drop in for summer training. ?A lot of them are making up their minds about their careers, and this is a good way to test the waters to find out for sure if this is what they really want to do,? adds Mira Kakkar of Thoughtshop.

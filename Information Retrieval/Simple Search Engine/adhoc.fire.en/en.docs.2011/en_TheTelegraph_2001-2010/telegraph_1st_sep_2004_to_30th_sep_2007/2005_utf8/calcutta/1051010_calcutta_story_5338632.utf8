The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Pump to boost water supply 

 CHANDANA GHOSH DASTIDAR, mayoral council member in charge of conservancy at Calcutta Municipal Corporation and CPM councillor of ward 101, met readers of The Telegraph at Baishnabghata-Patuli project to answer their queries. Participants included Subodh Roy, Sandip Banerjee, Anupam Roy, Pronab Chakraborty and Rabindra Nath Kar

Subodh Roy: The residents of Baishnabghata-Patuli project do not get drinking water from Garden Reach and as a result, suffer a lot. Will you please ensure that the water from Garden Reach reaches our township?

 Supply from Garden Reach waterworks is a longstanding demand of the township residents. They are presently forced to drink unhygienic water from tubewells.

 The problem can be overcome by building a booster station in the area. I have already spoken to municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya and mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya regarding setting up of a booster pumping station by the CMDA and CMC. 

Sandip Banerjee: Would you specify the work you have done in your ward? 

 Before specifying what I have done, I should mention the problems that the residents of my ward are facing. The drainage system here is a mess because of unplanned growth. I am trying to fix the problem soon.

 I have been a councillor for more than a decade. During my tenure, nearly eight children?s parks have come up in the area. Besides, a community hall has been built with the funds provided by the residents. There is a waterbody in the ward that I am planning to convert to a swimming pool. 

Anupam Roy: The sewerage problem in the ward is worrying us. The situation has steadily deteriorated with rapid increase in population. Do you have any specific plan to deal with sewerage disposal? Also, there isn?t any health centre in the ward. Will you please see to it that a health centre is built here? 

 You are right in saying that the condition of the sewerage system is worrying. The problem is assuming alarming proportions because the CMDA is gradually withdrawing from maintenance of the project. It is only dealing with sewerage crises after they become acute. It is my duty to ensure that the people are not inconvenienced as a result. I will take up the matter after the Puja. 

 There are a number of private hospitals in and around my ward. Those who can afford to, visit these hospitals. For the rest, there are government hospitals. At the moment, there isn?t much of a need for a health centre in the ward. 

Pronab Chakraborty: Will a health centre be built in the ward in the future? There is also need for another community hall. Are you planning to build one? 

 I want to build a ward office, with a conservancy wing, a health centre and other related departments.

 As far as constructing another community hall is concerned, we have approached the CMDA for land.

Anupam Roy: Do you have any plans for the Bagha Jatin crossing, which is always chaotic?

 The road could not be widened beyond Bagha Jatin, which has resulted in traffic chaos at the crossing. Moreover, the traffic management of the state police is poor. We are trying to remedy the situation. The scenario will change if the roadside shops are shifted. We discussed the matter with a private party. 

Rabindra Nath Kar: There is a police investigation centre in the Baishnabghata-Patuli project. But with the increase in population, we need a full-fledged police station. There is a vacant plot beside the fire brigade that can be utilised to set up a police station.

 You have pointed out an important problem. I shall take up the matter with the authorities. If the budget of the home department permits, we must get a full-fledged police station in the ward.

Concluded

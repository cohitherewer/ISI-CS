 New spice at age three

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Chef Sanjeev Kapoor shows actress Ria Sen how to toss together a meal at Grain of Salt 

 Choose your preferred meat from the captive cold storage of the island kitchen. Pick up a rare tome from the trolley to savour a slice of food history. De-stress and enjoy your favourite dishes while the children keep themselves busy with drawing tools and activity sheets?

 Grain of Salt, the Sanjeev Kapoor-signature world cuisine stop in 22 Camac Street, which turns three on Bengali New Year?s Day, is set to get an all new look. ?We are renovating to update the look and feel of the environment. We want to enhance the space that creates a total environment conducive to the guest and leaves the customer with a pleasant experience,? explains Nitin Kohli, director of the restaurant.

 A lot of basic earth colours have been used in the minimalist d?cor for the makeover. Explains interior designer Ajay Arya, behind the look of Shisha and The Platinum Lounge as well: ?Colours and finish that look great in a nightclub or bar are not going to look as good when you use them in a restaurant.?

 The three-plus, revamped Grain, to be unveiled this summer, will have contemporary d?cor with minimal change in lighting to create the desired atmosphere. 

 ?You need to create an interior environment that makes people feel good about themselves,? adds Arya.

 Not just the look, the basket of services on offer is also undergoing an overhaul. Following the a la carte menu makeover, the buffet spread will feature five non-vegetarian items against the four laid out now. Another novelty will be an island kitchen, which will be an improved version of the existing interactive one.

 ?The extremely encouraging experience with the interactive kitchen, which was just an arm?s length away from the main kitchen, gave us the confidence to take it a step forward and do the island kitchen,? explains Kohli. ?It will be a self-contained entity with a separate menu card where customers can regulate the cooking medium and spice level, while picking and choosing the ingredients.?

 Enhanced services will add to the new experience. Two new concepts ? children?s entertainment and food education ? will be part of the revised format. ?We want to create an image and develop concepts that prove standalone restaurants have acceptability, too.?

 Post-makeover, Grain of Salt is also looking at housing designer boutiques. ?It gives the diners something to do as they wait to be seated or for other guests to arrive. And, the items could be great mementoes from a special evening.?

 so being considered is Internet access in the waiting lounge of the restaurant to create ?a flexible, functional environment that relates to the clientele, business, image and location?.

 ?We have always questioned our surroundings to see how they can be improved, like Shisha ? The Hookah Bar and then, The Platinum Lounge. We are not reinventing the wheel, but pushing the envelope a little bit,? observes administration head Pankaj Tandon.

 Sums up master chef Sanjeev Kapoor: ?The hospitality industry is ever-changing. Businesses within that industry must always be advanced in their thinking. We feel the key to this is creating a total interior environment that is extremely versatile.?

 Slur spurs suicide

 A STAFF REPORTER

 For 29-year-old Sheela Roy, a former schoolteacher, torture and abuse at her in-laws? place were nothing unusual. But when her husband claimed the baby she was carrying was not his, she could bear no more. 

 Shocked and humiliated, she jumped in front of a running train near Ultadanga station on Thursday morning. A woman vendor rushed her to NRS Medical College, where she died early on Friday. 

 Her relatives lodged a police complaint against her husband and in-laws for her death. Police, however, initiated a case of abetment to suicide. ?The arrests will be made soon,? said an officer.

 Sheela was married around eight months ago to Tarun Roy, a schoolteacher, who lives in Barasat?s Hridaypur Park area.

 Debabrata Chatterjee, Roy?s next-door neighbour, saw Sheela leave home around 8.30 am on Thursday. ?I could sense that she was very depressed,? he recalled.

 The vendor who took her to hospital said: ?I started shouting when I saw her walking along the tracks and a train approaching from behind. Hearing my screams, she looked back and then jumped in front of the train. One of her feet was chopped off.? 

 After admitting Sheela, the hospital staff and police were in for another shock, when they informed the husband about the accident. ?We informed him around 11 am and he took seven hours to reach the hospital, barely 25 km from his residence,? said an officer of the NRS outpost.

 Asked about the delay, he told police: ?I was taking rest as I was feeling nervous.? 

 Police found that Sheela had lodged a complaint on December 5, alleging torture by her husband and in-laws. 

 ?My husband is having affairs with several women. Prodded by his parents and sisters, he beats me up frequently. I conceived five months ago but my husband is claiming that he has not fathered the baby. They can kill me any day,? Sheela had written in her complaint.

 Roy and his father Dinanath, however, denied the allegations. Sheela?s death was just an accident and she had never been tortured, they said.

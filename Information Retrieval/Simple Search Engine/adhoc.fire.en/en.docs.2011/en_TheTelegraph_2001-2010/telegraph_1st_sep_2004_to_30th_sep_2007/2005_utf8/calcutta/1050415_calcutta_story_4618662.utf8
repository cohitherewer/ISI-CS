Let it be functional, not fantastic

Makeover is the mantra at Minerva theatre. But unlike 

the Star revamp, stage players are having their say in how the Beadon Street address 

should look and feel. Reshmi Sengupta goes behind the scenes

Minerva theatre: Then and now

When Star theatre gleams at night in decorative light 

and fresh paint, a shabby building some distance away awaits a new lease of life 

in the dark. The Minerva makeover move was initiated by chief minister Buddhadeb 

Bhattacharjee in 2001. Later, he set the ball rolling for a Rs 5-crore revitalisation 

project under the supervision of architect Dulal Mukherjee. Here?s looking at 

what the theatre looked like in its heydays and what the future holds for it.

Flashback

The 6/1 Beadon Street address carved a special spot 

for itself on the Bengali theatre map soon after its unveiling in January 1893. 

Its founder-member, one of Bengal theatre?s leading men Girish Chandra Ghosh, 

went on to perform his last play here. Since then, the theatre has changed several 

hands and also been gutted more than once. 

But the golden era in its chequered career was probably 

the Sixties when Utpal Dutt triggered a new wave of form and content in this hot 

seat of traditional theatre. From Angar to Titash Ekti Nadir Naam, 

Kallol to Ferari Fauj, Othello to A Midsummer Night?s 

Dream ? Minerva rode high on a fine blend of eastern roots and western influences.

Facelift

?Its historical value apart, Minerva is otherwise 

a pretty ordinary building. It has some Georgian-Edwardian designs with a gallery 

as the one in New Empire. But the hall is in a rundown state. The condition of 

the stage is also very bad, the wooden planks can fall apart any time,? says Dulal 

Mukherjee, who held a meeting with several theatre veterans last Monday. 

The discussion was attended by Shobha Sen, Soumitra 

Chattopadhyay, Tapas Sen, Bibhas Chakraborty, Rudraprasad Sengupta, Usha Ganguly 

and Koushik Sen, among others.

?I wanted the views of the performers who would be 

using the theatre eventually... their suggestions on how the hall could be bettered,? 

said Mukherjee, currently drawing up the facelift blueprint.

Plans include an archive (which will showcase the 

costumes, pictures and other memorabilia from Utpal Dutt?s productions), a second 

lobby and revamped bathrooms. ?There?s no parking zone; let?s see if we can create 

one for the performers at least. The road in front can have a one-side parking 

facility. I also feel, we should improve the surrounding area. At least, if we 

could have a facelift for a half-km stretch. There are some beautiful buildings 

in this para, just adjacent to the theatre.?

The initial capacity of 750 seats will be cut short 

to about 500, while the basement can be used for rehearsals, added Mukherjee. 

?We should have a lot of activities around the theatre, keeping today?s generation 

in mind. Several people have suggested a coffee shop, book corner and things like 

that... I want to see some halls in London and will soon take a trip there,? said 

Mukherjee, working towards a November 2005 deadline.

Feedback

The authorities must ensure that Minerva does not 

end up being another Star theatre, which only brought mileage to the civic authorities. 

During the facelift, the original structure and the facade should be retained. 

The performance space should not be wasted in a bid to make room for improved 

infrastructure. Minerva has wonderful acoustics, which ought to be kept the way 

it is. Maintenance is a vital area that has to be addressed as most halls languish 

due to poor upkeep. 

An adda zone can be created which will help 

pull in the crowds. And the hall rent and other fares should be made affordable 

for theatre groups. Who can afford an exorbitant auditorium like Star theatre? 

We don?t need a posh, glitzy hall; we need a functional space where theatre can 

survive.

? Rudraprasad Sengupta

An intimate theatre with a small audience would be 

ideal at Minerva. The stage can be enlarged by doing away with the greenrooms 

on either side. The greenrooms can be shifted downstairs if need be. There can 

be a counter for music CD sale, a coffee shop and a seminar room, so that people 

can watch theatre and also have some adda. 

 ? Usha Ganguly

The number of seats should not exceed 500. We have 

plenty of large halls and most of them are godowns. If we don?t want Minerva to 

be another wedding venue, then it should be turned into a small cosy auditorium. 

Because that is what we need today ? a space for experimental theatre. This apart, 

I have suggested that the seats be kept flexible so that we can manoeuvre them 

as and when our performance demands. I have heard that Utpal Dutt used to place 

a plank right across the audience while staging Titash Ekti Nadir Naam. 

It would be really nice if such constraints are removed at the outset. A big stage 

and a small seating capacity would be ideal at Minerva.

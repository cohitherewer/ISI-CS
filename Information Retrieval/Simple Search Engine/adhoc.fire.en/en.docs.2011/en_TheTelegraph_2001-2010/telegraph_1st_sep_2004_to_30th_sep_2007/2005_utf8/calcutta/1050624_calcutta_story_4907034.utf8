 Crores for clinics

 - HUB-AND-SPOKE HEALTHCARE PLAN

 A STAFF REPORTER

 After building an ambitious 220-bed multi-speciality hospital in New Alipore, the BP Poddar Group is set to invest Rs 250 crore over the next three years to create a chain of hospitals and clinics in and around the city.

 The proposals include a 100-bed hospital and clinics adjacent to the city. There are also plans to set up a private medical college, a dental college and a college for nurses and paramedics in the near future.

 ?We want to provide quality healthcare facilities to the people at a nominal cost. We would like to implement the hub-and-spoke concept. The hub, of course, will be our main hospital in New Alipore,? said Devasish Poddar, managing director of the group.

 The first of the clinics was inaugurated on Thursday at Poddar Court, on Rabindra Sarani. ?The clinic is ideally located to serve the people of the city, especially those living in the central and northern parts,? said a spokesman for the clinic.

 Built over an area of over 10,000 sq ft, the clinic offers state-of-the-art diagnostic services to meet wide-ranging healthcare requirements. It has dedicated wards for surgery, medicine, gynaecology, obstetrics, gastroenterology and diabetes. Total pathological and imaging back-up is also available.

 ?We have put together a team of dedicated professionals, who are committed to provide medial care to the needy,? said Arun Poddar, chairman of the group.

 The group has plans to set up five clinics in 2006. In addition, a 100-bed nursing home is being set up at Kestopur, on VIP Road.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Mandira Bedi You don?t handle pressure 

well and accomplish more while working solo. You are capable of hard work and 

are willing to learn new things at work. You are trustworthy and idealistic about 

love. You go out of your way to understand your partner, but at times your high 

standards may not be realistic. You follow your heart when in trouble. ? Kusum 

Bhandari

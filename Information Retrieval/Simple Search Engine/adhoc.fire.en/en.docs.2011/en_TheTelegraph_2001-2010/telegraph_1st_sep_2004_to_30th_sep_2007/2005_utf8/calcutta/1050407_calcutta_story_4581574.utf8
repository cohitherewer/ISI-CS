 Art on the revival route

 The Mysore style of painting is an intricate and highly specialised one, using gold foil as an embellishment to give it a lavish, ornamental look. Attracted by this almost extinct mode of painting, Bikramjit Roy, an engineering graduate with a penchant for the arts, has attempted to revive the form, thus giving a fresh lease of life to a dying artistic tradition. The ongoing exhibition of his paintings, done in the Mysore style, reflects his efforts to preserve the glorious heritage of an ancient form that reached the zenith of its perfection during the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Evolved as a refinement of the old Vijayanagar school of art, this style of painting is steeped in Hindu mythology and tradition. Depicting popular religious themes and scenes from Hindu myths and legends, the gold-embossed paintings also rely on using bright colours, elaborate motifs and patterns, and heavy detailing to present a picture symbolising well-being and prosperity. Paintings of deities like Goddess Rajarajeswari, Rama Pattabhishekam and Chamundeswari, besides perennial favourites like Lakshmi and Saraswati, enjoy pride of place in this show.

 Event: An exhibition of paintings by Bikramjit Roy

 When: Till April 10; 4 pm - 8 pm

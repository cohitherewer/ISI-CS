 Perk up with wax wonders

Feng Shui 

Pinky Kapoor

 According to Feng Shui, 

 candles have different effects on the residents of a 

 house depending on their placements. They can enhance 

 various aspects from love and relationships to 

 career and fame provided they are placed in the 

 right corner of the house

Q: I am a homemaker and 

 have trained in candle making. I make jelly candles in various 

 shapes and sizes as a pastime. I also want to do it professionally. 

 I would need some information regarding the colours and 

 shapes that I should concentrate on for enhancing different 

 corners of the house.

 Sarita

 The Solution: The east 

 and south-east of the house are associated with wood energy 

 and are best enhanced by placing green tall and rectangular 

 candles. North is connected with career and business and 

 gets a boost when round or circular candles in different 

 shades of blue with splashes of glittering gold, silver 

 or copper are placed here. West and north-west, the areas 

 of children and mentors, are best enhanced with circular 

 or square candles in white, yellow and rust that have a 

 sparkling effect from metallic touches. North-east and south-west 

 require square and triangular candles in shades of cream, 

 yellow, red, maroon, purple, mauve, peach and pink. Star 

 and tall triangular candles in vibrant colours are best 

 placed in the south.

 Q: I have ventured into 

 real estate business along with a friend. We are moving 

 into a new office and are planning to have a chamber to 

 ourselves. The chamber has walls on three sides and a wooden 

 partition on the fourth, which separates it from the adjoining 

 room. Please advise the sitting arrangement and the directions 

 we should face while at work.

 Deepak Khanna

 The Solution: According 

 to Feng Shui, two people, even if they are best of friends, 

 should never sit facing each other. This can result in frequent 

 confrontations. You should both be in commanding positions 

 by occupying two powerful corners that face the entrance 

 diagonally. The directions are best decided according to 

 your date and time of birth. Since you have not furnished 

 this information, I can suggest that you avoid sitting under 

 a beam or facing a pillar or column. Avoid placing light 

 directly above your heads as it act as a poison arrow.

 Q: I have read about the 

 importance of fresh plants in Feng shui and would love to 

 have a few in my house. But I live in a very small flat 

 that doesn?t get enough sunlight. So it will be difficult 

 to maintain them. Please suggest some alternatives to fresh 

 plants.

 Sukanya Ghoshal

 The Solution: Fresh green 

 plants play a significant role in Feng Shui as they invite 

 Chi into our homes, which in turn nourishes our surroundings 

 with fresh and unpolluted air. As an alternative to fresh 

 plants, pictures or paintings of flowers, plants and nature 

 also create a positive ambience that helps stimulate energy 

 and symbolise growth. Colourful silk flowers can brighten 

 any area and augment wood energy in the house. Depending 

 on their colours they can activate different aspirations. 

 Yellow, red or pink flowers kept in the south-west strengthens 

 relationships between couples, while red, maroon, orange, 

 purple, mauve or peach helps in achieving fame and recognition. 

 Another option is to keep bamboo shoots in water with coloured 

 pebbles and marbles in crystal vases. They comfortably grow 

 indoors.

 Q: In my kitchen the stove 

 faces the door and hence I have to cook with my back towards 

 the entrance. As a result I am unable to see anyone entering 

 the kitchen. The set-up has been the same for several years. 

 I want to place a mirror near the stove so I can see anyone 

 entering the room. Please advise.

 Siddhi Mirza

 The Solution: A simple 

 solution will be to hang a wind chime at the kitchen door 

 that will ring when someone enters the room. Mirrors work 

 dangerously when they are made to reflect the fire in the 

 kitchen. They double up fire rather than the food cooked 

 on it. Mirrors reflecting the dining table with food laid 

 on definitely help double up the food and wealth of the 

 house.

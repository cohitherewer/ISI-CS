Blood on the streets 

 Road accidents have become a recurring menace in 

Calcutta. Ever since the construction of flyovers commenced, the accident rate 

has been escalating at an alarming rate. The administration is only concerned 

about the flyovers and is paying no heed to the enforcement of traffic rules. 

Recently, six-year-old Saurav Das, killed by a private bus, had to pay the price 

for the callousness of Bengal?s transport minister, who is reluctant to do anything 

for the safety of pedestrians. Private buses and auto-rickshaws are often the 

cause of road accidents. Rash drivers put lives at stake. Auto-drivers do as they 

please. All this, because traffic police seem to take no notice of the offenders. 

They are more interested in making a quick buck from errant drivers. Potholes 

are death traps. Hawkers and vendors occupy pavements, exposing pedestrians to 

the roads. The government must enforce traffic rules, repair roads and mete out 

stringent punishments to rash drivers.

 Road accidents have been abounding in the city recently. 

Through the week, newspapers narrated the misfortune of victims and the trauma 

which befell near and dear ones. One such victims of rash driving was my friend. 

Though she narrowly escaped with her life, the mishap led her to lose her left 

leg. We can never imagine the pain until someone close to us or we ourselves are 

drawn into such a situation. It?s high time the authorities woke up to the sorry 

plight of our roads and traffic. We, as responsible citizens, can sometimes prevent 

accidents by being alert and obeying traffic rules. While the authorities do their 

work, let us do our bit.

I am 

Sun?s rays enfolds me, 

And I drip till I remain no more. 

Humid diamonds crawl on my chest, 

And drench me to my very core. 

I give in to the sun?s fiery rage and to the moon?s mild protests. 

My resolutions are broken like a million times before.

Call me by a different name, 

I remain ceaselessly same. 

My home?s farthest from you there up high... 

I was, I am, I will be your very own sky!

Light 

Your strange, beautiful eyes 

Reminding me of a primordial dawn

Of a long ago pristine Dreamtime 

When we were children wondrous and innocent? 

When your eyes tell me this 

At the end of a tiresome, futile day 

Then there is Light.

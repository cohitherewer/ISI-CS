 Overhaul ahead for road rules

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said on Thursday his government was planning a ?massive overhaul? of the city?s traffic management system and will even amend certain legislation for that.

 He also called upon pedestrians to abide by road rules. 

 ?The situation near the Park Street crossing is so bad that I shudder every time I pass the stretch on my way to office,? Bhattacharjee said. ?People in business suits run across the road as if they are from villages. Pedestrians have to be disciplined if accidents are to be curbed. But before that, we need to improve the traffic infrastructure.? 

 As part of the project ? for which Rs 2.5 crore will be spent in the first phase, to cover the Central Business District and the BBD Bag area ? automatic signalling systems will be installed, bus bays, footpaths and guard rails will be set up and zebra crossings drawn.

 The second phase of the project ? for the rest of the city ? will cost Rs 5 crore.

 The chief minister agreed that the ?commission system of payment? for drivers and conductors was the principal reason for rash driving. ?But this cannot go on at the cost of pedestrians? lives. Drivers cannot run over people to earn more money.? The government, he added, is in talks with bus unions for replacing the commission system.

 He claimed police were cracking down on errant drivers. ?Many arrests have been made in the past few days. At times, cops have chased guilty drivers and arrested them. Some drivers were even rounded up from their houses.?

 Control room to report forgeries

 Binay Mukherjee: The fake goods racket has made inroads into all sections of the society. We, the ordinary people, are the most common target of these racketeers. Yet, the enforcement branch hardly takes the initiative to increase interaction with the public to obtain more feedback?

 I admit that we can do more to improve our communication with the public. However, we have also tried to make ourselves more approachable. We often participate in programmes held on March 15, the National Consumer Day, to promote awareness. We invite companies whose products have been counterfeited to interact with the people to help them identify fakes. We also ask the companies to make people aware through various means that counterfeit of their products are available in the market. We have found that the companies are reluctant to disseminate such information as this might lead to loss of business.

 In case you notice or suspect that fake products are being sold in a shop, call our control room at 2454-4800. Alternatively, you can fax us at 2475-1251 or email us at dcebyahoo.com. You can be rest assured that your identity would remain confidential.

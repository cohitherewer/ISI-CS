 ADB project push

 A STAFF REPORTER

 With a Left municipal board in the city and a new mayor at the helm, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s government has decided to put the Calcutta Environment Improvement Project, funded by Asian Development Bank (ADB), on the fast track.

 Mayor Bikash Bhattacharya and municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya met on Monday afternoon to chalk out plans for faster implementation of the Rs 1,800-crore project.

 ?The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has utilised only Rs 80 crore in the past five years of the project. We?re giving the project top priority and have decided to issue Rs 650-crore worth of work orders in the current year,? said the minister, after the meeting at Writers? Buildings.

 The government was spurred into action after the Centre, prior to the CMC elections in June, threatened to cut the project short, citing slow pace of work. 

 The Union finance ministry had asked the government to either wrap up the project as planned by 2007 ? which means spending around Rs 1,737 crore in the next 24 months ? or curtail it to a manageable level.

 ADB had also slapped a ?commitment charge? or a fine of nearly Rs 200 crore for the delay in executing the work. 

 ?We?ve taken up the matter with the Centre and it has agreed to grant us an extension. We are planning to ask for a two-year extension,? said minister Bhattacharya on Monday. 

 Funded with assistance from ADB, the project aims at improving drainage, sewerage, slums and solid waste management in some congested areas of south and south-west Calcutta. 

 Sewerage and drainage in areas like Behala, Jadavpur and Garden Reach are set to benefit. The project also envisages scientific land-filling at Dhapa.

 In another development, the implementation of the area-based tax scheme has been delayed, the minister disclosed.

 The scheme was to have been introduced in August, but the Bill will now be introduced in the next Assembly session. 

 The mayor will, meanwhile, go through the draft Bill and make his suggestions.

 Not a pretty picture: A Calcutta street-corner 

 Apropos the report ?Bank rap on varsity trio?, October 19, the World Bank has taken the appropriate step against the universities of Calcutta and Jadavpur and the Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur. 

 The institutions should be pulled up for not allowing students to assess their teachers. Teachers of the bygone era used to enjoy respect from all sections of the society due to their talent, dedication, compassion and deep concern for the well-being of their students. 

 But times have changed. Teachers of the present generation have lost the respect that their predecessors commanded. Their relationship with the students have become totally professional. 

 In such a situation, teachers cannot hope to escape scrutiny of students. Especially, with frequent questions being raised about the quality of teaching even in prestigious institutions in the state. 

 Naturally, assessment of teachers by students is now considered an essential part of modern education. The system is believed to improve the quality of education and provide a context to the teacher-student relationship. 

 While universities in Bengal dither to introduce assessment of teachers, the British government is readying to hand over sweeping powers to schoolstudents and their guardians to boost the quality of education. 

 A white paper on education prepared by the Tony Blair government empowers guardians to sack head teachers of under-performing schools. Parents have also been given the green light to set up and run their own schools. Students of secondary schools, on their part, can even participate in appointment of staff members. They will also be important parts of school councils. 

 Assessment by students can not only help teachers to improve on the areas they are deficient in, but will also give them a clearer idea of what is expected of them. 

 It is heartening that the Bengal Engineering and Science University is taking the necessary measures to satisfy the World Bank. Calcutta and Jadavpur universities should follow the lead. 

 Sunil Banerjee,

 VIP Road. 

 ?Kichhu ekta korun? Shohortake janjal mukto karun? Ektu shabuj karun? Shobaike kaje lagan? ? the desperation in the chief minister?s appeal seems to be the silver lining in a huge gloomy cloud (Monitor rises from mess, October 27). He seems to be echoing the cry of all intelligent residents of the city. 

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s words offer a semblance of hope at a time when people have stopped expecting anything from the government departments and their chiefs. However, the chief minister?s sincerity will be of no use unless his colleagues in the Assembly and party comrades cooperate. 

 Sankar Pal,

 Howrah. 

 It will be wonderful if the municipal affairs department takes up a scientific solid waste management programme. Even our chief minister has confessed that he has seen schoolchildren pass garbage dumps holding handkerchiefs to their noses. I strongly believe that the public must cooperate with the administration in keeping Calcutta clean. 

 B.N. Bose,

 Dum Dum.

 Apropos ?Justice? Come back later?, October 20, the authorities often organise events to alleviate the common man?s fear and suspicion of cops. The policemen present an extremely friendly face during such meets. But their claws come out as soon as they put on the uniform. 

 It is apparent that young executive Indranil Chatterjee lost his life due to rash driving on part of police. The cops are now trying their best to hush up the case. At least the Police Welfare Society and the Police Wives? Association should do something to help Chatterjee?s family. 

 Abdul Fateh Kamruddin, 

 Chandbati, Hooghly. 

 I lost a bet with a friend by failing to recognise the bald old man on top of the Metro front page on October 21 as Shammi Kapoor, the hero of many a film on college romance. How time flies! 

 Prahlad Agarwala,

 Majdia, Nadia. 

 The state government?s decision to grade Madhyamik students is commendable (Madhyamik goes for grades, October 20). The shift should have been implemented much earlier. 

 The question pattern should be changed to objective-type, like other boards, so that the students are forced to read the text book carefully. 

 The state government needs to be on its toes to ensure that the students do not suffer because of a backward education system. 

 Ratan Kumar Halder,

 Bankim Pally. 

 Apropos ?Strike-free IT in Buddha?s reach?, October 24, after imposing bandh raj on the state for decades, CITU is thankfully being prevented from disrupting the functioning of the IT industry. We can only hope that it is not too late for an industrial turnaround. 

 Chandan Ray,

 Sakuntala Park. 

 Apropos the report ?UGC frown has varsity cut leave?, October 18, it is unfortunate how the CPM-controlled Calcutta University Teachers? Association (CUTA) is pressuring the university to defy University Grants Commission (UGC) rules. The Left generally abides only by the rules best suited to their immediate interest. The UGC should rein in the association and implement uniform rules. 

 Govinda Bakshi, 

 Budge Budge. 

 Apropos Chameli Pal?s letter in the Calcutta Column on October 24, it would be a crime against humanity if both the railway authorities and government of West Bengal refuse to rehabilitate evictees of Gobindapur colony. 

 Sachindra Nath Mitra,

 Rakhal Ghosh Lane.

 Apropos ?Campus protest? in the City Diary on October 27, the students and teachers of the faculty of fishery sciences, West Bengal University of Animal and Fishery Sciences, had been on round-the-clock dharna since October 24 to protest the failure of the university authority to shift instruments, books, laboratory and departmental furniture from Mohanpur, Nadia, to the new campus in Chakgaria. As the vice-chancellor and the registrar failed to give us any assurance, we, the students, were compelled to continue the agitation until our demands were met. 

 Bipul Mazumdar,

 Chakgaria, Panchasayar.

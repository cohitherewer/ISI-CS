 Speak up to voice your fortune 

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 Given a choice between good looks and a good voice personality, what would you opt for? The fashion-driven world sure will not compromise on the former, but city doctors stress the virtue of the latter.

 A combination of ignorance, prolonged exposure to pollution and other factors has resulted in poor voice personality for average Calcuttans, depriving them of ? counsellors say ? a chance to make a memorable impression on others.

 ?It is sad. Most Calcuttans seem to suffer from an inferior voice personality syndrome. An astounding 80 per cent of the people do not know proper diction,? says ENT specialist Anirban Biswas, who runs a special clinic in Salt Lake to develop voice personality.

 According to experts, a good voice is more a trademark than a communication channel. But sadly, most Calcuttans are unaware about the positive aspects of a good voice personality. 

 ?We are judged by both written and spoken words. As most of us speak a great deal more than we write, we need to master every nuance of voice if we are to win friends, enjoy life fully and earn a great living,? explains speech therapist Sabira Merchant.

 Doctors say a good voice comes from a healthy throat, which helps develop proper articulation, intonation (sound of the voice) and inflection (change in voice, including pace, pitch and pause).

 In the city, however, exposure to air pollution, smoke, allergies, viral or bacterial infections has left a devastating effect on the voice. ?Symptoms of a bad throat may include dry and itchy throat and sharp or burning pain while swallowing saliva. A hoarse, husky or strangled voice indicates the infection has spread to the voice box,? explains ENT surgeon Arunavo Sengupta.

 According to speech therapists, articulation, intonation and inflection together form a voice personality. ?Nearly 40 per cent of the meaning of what you say is conveyed by the personality of your voice,? says Merchant, who is also on the advisory board of the Strepsils Throat Care Advisory Board, which conducts free training in throat problems and their cure.

 To study voice pattern and difficulties, ENT specialist Biswas uses a computer software called Dr Speech. ?We activate the software and ask the patient to speak. His voice is recorded and the software shows up all the flaws, on the basis of a voice parameter fitted in the computer,? explains Biswas.

 From teachers to children, call centre executives to singers, people from all walks of life have turned up at the clinic. The recovery rate, the doctor says, is 70 per cent.

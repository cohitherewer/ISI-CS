 lsquo;I won rsquo;t act in my productions rsquo;

 SUNIEL SHETTY tells Pratim D. Gupta why he has no problems playing the multistarrer man and why he wants to keep his roles in front of the camera and behind it separate

 The only way to combat piracy is to pack a film with stars and make the most of the first weekend, is what actor-producer Suniel Shetty has to say. Here, in his Chocolate look

 Almost all your forthcoming films ? Dus, Chocolate, Deewane Hue Pagal, Phir Hera Pheri ? are multistarrers. Is that the only way out in the industry these days?

 That is the new mantra. Not just in movies. Look at your newspaper business. A tabloid comes with 16 different supplements ? sports, movies, property, international? Then multiplexes have taken over standalone theatres. Malls have taken over standalone shops. Earlier we used to be happy with one car. Now, we have five cars. Just like that, multistarrers are the need of the hour. And we shouldn?t worry too much since Indian cinema is on a high and making progress.

 The cost of making films has risen with no special returns and piracy has turned out to be the killer. The only solution is to make films with lots of stars so that the movie opens big. The first weekend is very crucial. If that goes well, half the battle is won. That?s where Dus will score. The advance has been historic. The multiplexes in Mumbai are running 11-12-13 shows a day and the first four days have been sold out. That?s a clean sweep.

 What do you play in Dus?

 I play this Canadian police officer Dan who helps out the Indian anti-terrorist squad, comprising Sanju, Abhishek and Zayed, to catch a dangerous terrorist. I am a Muslim, who is born and brought up in Calgary. I also have some romantic interest in the movie.

 Anubhav Sinha is known for his mushy tearjerkers. How did he make this action thriller?

 I have always liked Tum Bin. I thought it was shot very well. Dus, too, has been shot very beautifully. I am very confident he will deliver with Dus. The film has a lovely blend of youth and experience, style and content. It?s also got everything from action to romance to emotion to comedy. Most importantly, it has got the thrill and style that a film like this should have.

 You have a very raw look in Vivek Agnihotri?s directorial debut, Chocolate?

 It?s a very different kind of a film and Vivek has shot it brilliantly. He has finally finished editing the film and it?s really looking rocking. It?s great to see this whole new group of directors like him coming up with new ideas and new styles of film-making. All of them may not work ? three might not and one might. We should be happy as long as the gamble is paying off?

 Are you allowed to talk about your role in Chocolate?

 (Laughs) Not really. All I can say is that I play this very complex character and I wanted it to be that way. Chocolate is all about hardcore performances. And when you have people like Anil Kapoor and Irrfan, you better pull your socks up. Also, the story-telling technique is so different. Vivek just won?t let you settle down. You may think you have solved the problem but you haven?t. And finally you are like, ?Holy shit! Why didn?t I think of that??

 In the middle of these biggies you have a small film Amar Joshi Shaheed Ho Gaya?

 It?s small but it?s phenomenal. It?s all black humour. It?s about this new director who?s passed out of the UK film school and wants to make a film in Bollywood. He comes to India looking for a producer and it?s about the kind of things he has to go through. He asks questions like ?Yeh hero suddenly nachta kyun hai?? and ?Itni thandi mein heroine short skirt pehenke kyun nach rahi hai?? If the film is marketed properly, it has great commercial prospects.

 What?s next from your production house Popcorn Entertainment?

 We are starting a film in January to be directed by Priyadarshan. It has Akshay Kumar and another hero is being finalised.

 You won?t be in it?

 No, I am not going to be part of any of my productions. It?s better that way if I am not creatively involved in my projects. I have a free hand that way. And why do I need to act in my own productions when I am getting to work in great films with great cast? If I am good in those films I am going to stand out like I did in films like Border.

 And finally, why did you have to do that one-shot appearance in Paheli?

 I did it for Shah Rukh and I have no regrets. I never claimed that I had a big role in Paheli. It?s such a pleasure and honour to be part of a Red Chillies production.

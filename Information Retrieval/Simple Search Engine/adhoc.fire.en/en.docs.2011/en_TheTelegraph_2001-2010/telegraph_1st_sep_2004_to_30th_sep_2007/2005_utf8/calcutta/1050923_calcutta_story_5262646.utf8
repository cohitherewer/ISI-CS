 Hospital pitch for foreign patients 

 - Price weapon to lure business 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Taking a cue from the state government, private healthcare players in the city are gearing up to attract patients from southeast Asia by offering them guaranteed medical success at the best prices.

 The Association of Hospitals of Eastern India, an umbrella organisation of 13 major private healthcare providers, has already taken the first steps in this regard. A few institutions, including AMRI and Wockhardt, has even started in-house training for bagging international accreditation, like Joint Commission International.

 Several are working overtime to formalise deals with international insurance companies like BUPA and Blue Shield, a must for treating patients from abroad.

 ?At Wockhardt, we have set up a special unit ? department of international marketing ? to look after overseas business. We are also upgrading our infrastructure. A new hospital, spread over two acres, off the EM Bypass, is in the offing,? said Rupali Basu, general manager of Wockhardt Hospitals.

 S.B. Purakayastha, director of AMRI Hospitals, said: ?We have started an in-house training, with modules in bedside manners, spoken English and other topics, to meet the global standards. It?s time one looked beyond the borders.?

 The hard sell of the city hospitals will start early December, with members of the association camping in Dhaka for a five-day session. 

 ?Even a few years ago, Calcutta did not figure in healthcare outsourcing from India. We have decided to first showcase our potential to neighbouring countries,? said Sajal Dutta, president of the association.

 The representatives of the medical institutes that constitute the association will explain to the upper crust of the Bangladeshi population why it makes sense to head for Calcutta for treatment instead of Singapore. 

 ?We may be getting some patients from Bangladesh, but that is not enough. The high-end patients are still opting for Bangkok and Singapore for even basic operations like lapcoli. This, despite Calcutta having one of the best pools of US and UK-trained doctors,? said Pradip Tondon of Belle View Nursing Home.

 The Dhaka session will be followed up by trips to Indonesia and Bangkok. Thousands of patients from both places travel to Singapore for treatment.

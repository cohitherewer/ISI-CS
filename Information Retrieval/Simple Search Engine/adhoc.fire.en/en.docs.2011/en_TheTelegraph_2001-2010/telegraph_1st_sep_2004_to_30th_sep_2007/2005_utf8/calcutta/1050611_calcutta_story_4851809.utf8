The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Leaders bicker, dwellers suffer

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Residents of the area call them ?killer tracks?. They have watched people come close to death, falling off their two-wheelers and crashing on the road, trying to negotiate the BB Ganguly Street stretch of tram tracks, where the potholed, cobbled road has turned into a death trap.

 Residents and traders of the area recall how they have complained about it to the civic authorities, only to be shown signboards declaring that the repair of roads with tram tracks is not the responsibility of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC).

 Sibram Mahato, a trader in Bowbazar market, recounts how a few days ago, a taxi broke its axle after falling into a pothole and one of its wheels broke loose and came spinning furiously towards him.

 ?It was a lucky escape for me,? Sibram says. ?But those in the taxi were luckier. They got away without a scratch. While the state government and the CMC bicker, we suffer.?

 Adjoining Chandni Chowk may not have tram tracks, but it, nevertheless, has its share of problems. 

 A health centre had been promised by the Trinamul Congress-led CMC and a building was allotted for the purpose. In the past four years, that is the only progress the project has made.

 ?This area, comprising College Square, Bowbazar, and Chandni Chowk, is supposed to be the city?s hub, but no one is bothered about its residents,? says insurance agent Ranjit Agarwal, in dismay.

 Residents of wards 40, 46 and 47, which comprise this area, say Chittaranjan Avenue may be getting a layer of mastic asphalt, but the lanes and bylanes that fork out of it are plagued by a perennial shortage of water, a clogged drainage system, potholed roads and piling garbage.

 Councillor of ward 46 Prabhakar Mondal (CPM) has faced the wrath of the residents and is only too willing to admit the lack of amenities in Chandni Chowk. 

 ?I am admitting that hardly any work has been done here. I have raised the issue repeatedly at the CMC?s board meetings, but no one from the Trinamul has paid any heed to my appeals,? he says.

 ?At least five lakh people come to this area every day on business, but there is neither any drinking water facility nor a public toilet,? he says.

 In contrast, councillor of ward 40, Partha Bose of the Trinamul, says he is ?proud? of what he has done in College Square, ?provided trade licences to book-sellers who dot the pavements and developed the square for Rs 20 lakh?.

 ?The water tank in the square has been cleaned and several amenities have been provided,? Bose claims. ?It is a much better place now.?

 But residents tell another story. ?There is either a shortage of drinking water or the roads gets waterlogged after every smart shower,? complains Biplab Siddhanta, a senior resident of Surya Sen Street.

 Calcutta calling

 You can?t blame Mrinal Sen for being partial towards Anjan Dutt?s work, what with him having played the leading man in his films like Antareen and Kharij. So on Friday evening when Dutt?s documentary around the mobile theatre project of Goethe-Institut was premiered at Max Mueller Bhavan, Sen sounded overwhelmed. 

 ?For me, this is beyond cinema and I am really intrigued by the film,? said Sen. ?He has had the courage of experimenting with the medium. When Anjan returns to his room and looks at himself in the mirror, he would be able to see the streak of genius in him.?

 It?s not everyday that the second-floor auditorium at the Ballygunge Circular Road address has people sitting on the stairs to watch a documentary. But it?s also not everyday that an Anjan Dutt film is seen ? Bada Din was a decade back and Bow Barracks Forever just refuses to release.

 The man, known for his fiction, did have a refreshing take on the documentary format. Of course, Dutt was helped by the original theatre concept of callers conning people on the phone and directing them through streets of Calcutta and Berlin. While the theatre project called Call Cutta by the group Rimini Protokoll happened from March to June earlier this year, Dutt?s film has just got made and will travel festivals around the world.

 ?The best thing about the film is that it will show to the world that young Indians are a different bunch of people who are dynamic and a bundle of fresh energy contrary to the worldwide perception about them,? said Martin Waelde, director of Goethe-Institut.

 By mixing and matching carefully selected conversations between callers and walkers from the Calcutta and Berlin walk, Dutt does manage to stitch together a bizarre tale of confused identities, spontaneous humour and unexpected pathos. The backstories of the characters, though, are not properly etched out and don?t allow you to get inside their heads.

 Before Dutt embarks on his next fictional tale of adopted identities, The Bong Connection, from January, the documentation of such a unique theatre project across two continents must have come handy.

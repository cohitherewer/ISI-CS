The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Accord eludes beam biz 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 It has been almost a month since the state government provided a second push to bring order to the cable chaos. 

 But the response, yet again, has been far from impressive.

 After cable operators turned a blind eye to its cable census aimed at determining the number of households in the CMDA area, the government extended the deadline for self-declaration of numbers by operators at a meeting on March 17 with broadcasters and multi-system operators (MSOs).

 Chief secretary to the chief minister Arun Bhattacharya told Metro on Tuesday: ?We are meeting information and broadcasting ministry officials in Delhi on April 15 and will raise these issues with them, besides discussing the cable census project? After that, we can have the next meeting with broadcasters and MSOs to take stock of the situation.?

 Bhattacharya had announced after the previous meeting that the government would advertise in newspapers and on television channels, asking operators to come forward and disclose the number of households under them. 

 The situation has not improved since, with lack of communication between the government and its machinery a primary problem point.

 ?We saw a government notice in a Bengali daily on March 25, asking operators to provide connection details by April 9 to the local police stations,? said a north Calcutta cable operator. ?But when we approached the thana, we were told that there was no such directive to receive the details and they refused to accept our documents.?

 A section of the operators is also not too keen on disclosing subscriber numbers, which would stem the rampant under-declaration.

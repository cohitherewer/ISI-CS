 Tvastr, the new signature outlet of Swabhumi, the Heritage Park, defines the essence of this multi-cultural hangout as it showcases India in all its diversity. 

 Opened with the intention of bringing the best from around the country, this classy and lavishly designed store is steadily becoming the favoured sari shopping destination in the city. 

 It took the authorities of the park six months to visit the weavers across the country, from down south to Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and of course, Bengal.

 Handpicked and carefully chosen, each piece is unique in its own way. Be prepared to see the most stunning designs and colour combinations on cotton and silk. From tribal motifs on cotton and the gamchha sari to the classy evening wear in tussar and south silks ? there is something for every occasion. 

 ?We wanted to get the middlemen out of the system. Here the weavers give us the saris directly and thus we get the best things at the cheapest prices for our customers,? said Tazeen Choudhury on behalf of the store.

 A range of antique-look silver jewellery has been collected from across Bengal to help shoppers accessorise their buys. A range of jute bags and footwear completes the look. 

 One can check out all this and more at the ongoing exhibition at the store till April 19.

 Mall magic

 Star power proved to be the biggest draw at the launch of Sriniketan?s second exclusive showroom at The Metropolis, Hiland Park, on Saturday, as actress Sharmila Tagore dropped by looking her usual elegant self.

 Sriniketan is a mall retailing a wide variety of garments, jewellery and cosmetics at affordable prices. While the traditional feel of the first 12,000-sq-ft showroom at Sodepur has so far captivated the hearts and wardrobes of many, the second venture expects to do the same for the residents of the south Calcutta address and beyond. 

 At the launch, however, all eyes were glued to Sharmila while she spoke freely on several issues, including the most burning of them all ? the casting couch. 

 As for the project at hand, she liked its green setting. ?Calcutta has changed so much in the past few years. It is surprising to witness green patches like these still survive amidst all the development. I only wish the small water-bodies that line the Bypass were cleaned. You can?t imagine the difference it could make,? she suggested.

 Back to the store, the product range is extensive. ?We have almost 10 times the amount of saris any other store would stock. Cotton, silk, crepe, georgette or the synthetic variety, you name it and we have it,? said Tarun Barik of Sriniketan. The variety extends to colours and motifs as well, which range from tantric symbols, floral and geometric patterns to batik, tie-and-dye and also sequin work. 

 ?I love taant saris and the collection here is so nice,? gushed Sharmila.

 The store also houses some trendy salwar suits, embroidered kurtas for men, an abundance of fabrics and dress materials, kids? clothing and plenty of beauty products.

 Jazz poetry

 Anjum Katyal, known for her jazz performances, unveiled a different side to her talent ? poetry. At an event hosted by Landmark on Saturday evening, Katyal joined hands with an upcoming band, Rudraa, to bring together an entertaining evening. 

 Reciting her original works like Healing, To my daughters and Slow dissolve, the singer ensured that she incorporated jazz styles in her recitation as well. With the bunch of talented musicians for company, it was not long before the audience was engrossed in the proceedings of the evening. 

 The musicians included Sandip Bose and Subhajit on guitar, Amit Ray on bass guitar and Jay Bhattacharya on drums. Dibendu Mukherjee and Mohua Ghosh rendered vocal support. 

 The band went on to perform a couple of originals as well like Shaat ta chand and Chil in Bengali, Tear and All in a dream in English.

 Baking bread

 The Hyatt Regency bakery has come up with a collection of 40 different types of breads from across four continents that are up for grabs at Waterside Caf?, the coffee shop at the hotel. 

 The first-of-its-kind international bread promotion, conceptualised by the pastry chef of the hotel, it?s a perfect treat for the experimenting Calcuttan. One can now hope to experience the exotic taste of the Tuscan harvest bread stuffed with raisins and rum or dig into Parker House rolls popularised by the Parker House hotel in Boston. 

 The freshly baked breads on display at the pastry shop not only add to the visual delight, but the aroma is doing wonders to get mouths watering. 

 Over three months of research led pastry chef Bikram Sandhu to come up with an extensive selection that covers as many as 15 countries. Picking the speciality bread of each region, Sandhu has worked hard at bringing out the authentic taste and smell of the breads. ?Most of the bread we are baking has some story attached to it,? said the man behind the promotion. 

 For the entire month of April, weekends will celebrating the staple bread of a particular country at the eatery. Thus, the first weekend of the month has been dedicated to Italy and Germany, the second to Britain and the Middle East, the third to France and America and the fourth to South Africa, Turkey, Sweden, Mexico, Hungary, Switzerland, Finland, Sardinia and Greece. 

 Priced between Rs 15 and Rs 100, the bakes promise to enliven your weekend breakfast.

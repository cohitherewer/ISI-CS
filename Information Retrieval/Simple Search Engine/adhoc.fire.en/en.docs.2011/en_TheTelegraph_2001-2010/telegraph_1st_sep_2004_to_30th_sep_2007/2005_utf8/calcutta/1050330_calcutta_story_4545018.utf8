 Move over beauty parlours and body care centres. The next big thing in beauty care all set to roll into the city is an exclusive skin clinic, dealing in all kinds of derma problems under one roof. 

 Kaya Skin Clinic, a national chain of skincare studio that has also spread its wings in Dubai, will be launched in the city on Wednesday. While three centres ? in Loudon Street, City Centre and Alipore ? are on the cards, the first one would be the Loudon Street address. The chain will be flagged off in Calcutta by model-turned-actress Aditi Govitrikar.

 ?Through a research conducted in 2002, we realised the importance of looking good for today?s women. Having a flawless skin is one of the main aspirations and we wanted to capture this yet untapped territory,? said Nitisha Agrawal, a spokesperson for Kaya, adding that the company uses the latest technologies available globally and customises them to suit Indian skin types. The treatments are non-surgical with long-lasting effects.

 The services at Kaya start with a skinscription ? the prescription for a client?s skin. An in-depth analysis and treatment plan, customised to each skin type, is drawn up by a certified dermatologist. The treatments include services like glycolic peels, skin brightening and polishing, permanent hair removal, pigmentation and acne scar reduction, face and eye rejuvenation and more. The starting price tag for the services is Rs 400.

 It?s not just services that Kaya has in store. A range of skincare products, developed by the company through research in dermo-cosmetic laboratories al over the world, are also on offer. While the in-store services use these extensively, the products can also be purchased for post-service usage. The key offerings from the Kaya line are Skin Lightening Complex, Lighten and Smooth Under-eye Gel, Daily Moisturising Sunscreen and Recharging Night Cream. 

 While the chain has gained immense popularity among women in 10 cities across India, the unisex clinics are frequented by a large number of men as well. ?Our total client base right now is about 40,000 and men constitute around 30 per cent of that,? said Nitisha. 

 And she revealed that while the men visit Kaya for a variety of services, particularly popular among them is the Permanent Beard Shaping treatment.

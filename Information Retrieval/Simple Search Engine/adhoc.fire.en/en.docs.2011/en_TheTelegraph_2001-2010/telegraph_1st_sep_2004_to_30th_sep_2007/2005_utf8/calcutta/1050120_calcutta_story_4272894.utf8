The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Feminine focus in swirl style

The year has changed and the mercurys 

dipped, but the skirt continues to be the rage. Ipsita Deb goes shop-hopping 

to hunt out popular picks

Ever since India Fashion Week 2004 happened, there?s 

only one garment ruling the fashion frontiers ? the skirt. While skirts, skirts 

and more skirts have been the boldest style trend throughout 2004, these classic 

feminine lowers are still going strong in the new year too. 

Whether it?s a cocktail party, a friends? night out, 

a formal do or a stroll in a shopping mall, skirts seem to match the mood of every 

occasion. 

Fuelling the trend, which according to stylists is 

here to stay, the malls and stores around town have filled up their racks with 

a variety of designs. Goodlife takes a look at the trends doing the rounds 

in skirt style. 

Trend talk 

Pencil and short skirts may be hot internationally, 

but it?s volume and flares that find favour with conservative Calcutta. The girlie 

feel with lots of ruffles in crushed fabrics is popular here. The voluminous ones 

are mostly gathered at the waist, while there are A-line skirts that are fitted 

till the hip and flared after that.

The most popular style generated by the skirt rage 

is the ghagroo. These can be worn with anything from short tops and kurtis 

for a trendy effect, to bustiers and dupattas for an ethnic feel. 

Megha Modi?s fashion studio in Forum offers an interesting 

range of ethnic ghagroos in a variety of colours. These can be teamed with 

matching blouses. 

The Camac Street outlet of Pantaloons also has a range 

of crushed ghagroos with coin embellishments, subtle paisley work, polka 

dots and embroidered motifs. The range is priced at Rs 899.

Colour code

Bold colours seem to be dominating wardrobes this 

season and the same holds true for skirts as well. Young designer Priyanjali Ray 

feels vibrant colours will rule the skirt fetish for quite some time. ?Colours 

are back with a bang. Bright, dramatic jewel colours are vying for attention in 

every texture. Shades of purple like lilac, lavender, true purple, amethyst and 

violet, as well as pink hues like peach, ballet pink, bright pink, rose, sugar 

pink and fuchsia are hot. Some coral and aquamarine are also being seen on skirts.? 

Priyanjali has lined up a wide range of skirts at her 5, Alipore Park Road studio. 

These are priced from Rs 1,200 onwards.

Fabric faves 

The choice of texture is extremely diverse. While 

soft fabrics like chiffon, georgette and satin are the all-time favourites in 

skirts because of their fall, the ones in suede and leather are also doing well. 

Tweed and woollen skirts have also made their presence felt this winter. 

For those who want the comfort factor of wool, combined 

with a trendy look, Bizarre at Forum is a good haunt. Woollen skirts in colourful 

stripes and checks serve the purpose just right. These are priced rather steep, 

starting from Rs 1,600. 

The other varieties at the same destination, however, 

throw up good budget buys. The suede, denim and pleated cotton skirts here are 

quite stylish yet reasonable, starting at Rs 499. 

However, if you are looking for jazzy embellishments 

this is not the right place, since most of the stuff here is rather simple. Assymetrical 

layers and broad metallic belts are the only adornments that deck up the skirts 

here.

At Be:, also in Forum, the fabric focus is really 

wide ? chiffon, organza, shimmering metallic lace, satin, silks and crepes. The 

feminine falls by Gauri and Nainika and the figure-hugging forms from Shantanu 

and Nikhil are good picks for party wear. 

Pretty prints 

The focus is firmly on femininity and floral prints 

affirm the style. The floral look, be it with prints, embroidery or embellishments, 

is really in. This is combined with paisleys, geometric patterns and blended checks. 

A new style this season is reversible skirts in bright solid colours.

Those who fancy pretty prints are spoilt for choice 

at Shoppers? Stop in Forum, Be:, Little India and stores like Shock, Options and 

Stylesmith in Metro Plaza. 

At Pantaloons, with its season-end sale on in full 

swing, the collection of skirts is pretty wide. The prints range from colourful 

geometric patterns to flower power.

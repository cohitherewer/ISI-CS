 High court seal on vehicle phase-out

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court on Wednesday put a seal of approval on the state government?s decision to make it mandatory for commercial vehicles more than 15 years old to be replaced with new Bharat Stage II-compliant models, if their permits are to be renewed.

 The transport department has stopped renewing permits of buses, minibuses and taxis older than 15 years. Some bus-owners had individually moved the court and filed a writ petition challenging the government?s decision.

 Amal Sen, counsel for the bus-owners, on Wednesday argued that the government could not issue an order denying renewal of permits. 

 ?Nowhere in the motor vehicles rules is there any condition for replacement of old vehicles with new ones for renewal of permits. Replacement of vehicles should not be linked with permit renewal,?? he asserted.

 Countering the argument, assistant government pleader Debashis Kargupta said the transport department?s order was on the basis of the guidelines of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules.

 After hearing both sides, Justice Aniruddha Basu dismissed the petition of the bus-owners and ruled that the government?s order on replacement of old vehicles was valid.

 The transport department, in its notification dated June 7, 2004, had imposed a ban on plying of commercial vehicles older than 25 years. The high court had later issued a stay and ruled that the government could not issue such a notification without legislation.

 After the Centre fixed 15 years as the life-span of commercial vehicles, the transport department modified its order and scaled down the age bar to 15 years.

 The public vehicles department, accordingly, stopped renewal of permits to vehicles registered before 1990. Renewal is being allowed only if the vehicles are replaced with Bharat Stage II-compliant ones.

 ?Though the decision of the government might hurt some bus-owners, there is no alternative if we want to save the environment. The bus-owners who face problems in replacing the vehicles will have to give in for a greater cause,?? asserted transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury.

 The bus operators, however, said they would move the division bench against Wednesday?s order. 

 ?Though the case was filed by individual bus-owners and no organisation was party to the case, the court order applies to everyone. We are seeking legal opinion on the order,?? indicated Swarnakamal Saha, president of Bengal Bus Syndicate. ?If the government sticks to its decision, more than 75 per cent of the commercial vehicles will have to go off the road, causing major problems for commuters in the city.?

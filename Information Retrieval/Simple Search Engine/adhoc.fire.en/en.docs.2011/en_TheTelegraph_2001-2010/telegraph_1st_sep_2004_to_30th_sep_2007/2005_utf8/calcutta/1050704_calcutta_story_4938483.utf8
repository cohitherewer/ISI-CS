 SEAT OF CIVIC GOVERNANCE: The Calcutta Municipal Corporation headquarters. A Telegraph picture 

 When former mayor Subrata Mukherjee instituted his council five years ago, he was accused of being biased in favour of south Calcutta. While packing his council with councillors from the south, Mukherjee had even ignored pleas from his party leader Mamata Banerjee, that he induct a few from the north and Jadavpur (an added area).

 On Friday, when the Left Front finalised its mayoral council, it took care to restore the balance. Three councillors from Jadavpur and two from north Calcutta have found berths in the council. Besides, of the 10 members, three are women (the highest-ever representation of women councillors).

 The other important decision of the Left Front concerning civic governance is the virtual abolition of the market department: civic markets will run under the direct supervision of mayor Bikash Bhattacharjee?s office.

 For the first time since 1985, some of the major portfolios in the civic body ? such as water supply, education and slum development ? have been restructured.

 The responsibility of water supply to ships has been taken away from the water supply department and given to the deputy mayor. Information and public relations, part of the education department, has been merged with the department of parks and gardens. Environment protection used to be the responsibility of the mayoral council member in charge of slum development, but in the new board, it will be looked after by the member in charge of lighting.

 While the previous Trinamul Congress-BJP board had allotted six of the 14 portfolios to councillors from south Calcutta, the new dispensation has provided berth to one from the south ? that too from Kasba, in the south-eastern part of the city.

 The Left Front has also made clear its emphasis on east Calcutta by inducting three members from that area. The last council had two. 

 The Left Front list indicates that the CPM had a trying time fulfilling its promise of even distribution of berths among councillors from across the city and greater representation for women. Farzana Choudhury happens to be the luckiest councillor, as she has got a berth in her very first term.

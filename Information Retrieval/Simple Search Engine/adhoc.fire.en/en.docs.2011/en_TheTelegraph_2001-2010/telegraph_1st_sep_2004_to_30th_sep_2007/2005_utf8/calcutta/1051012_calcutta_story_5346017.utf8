 Funds are needed to maintain the Alipore zoo better. The number of visitors 

to the zoo fluctuates through the year. The rush is maximum during the festival 

season and winter, the footfall count drops drastically during summer and monsoon. 

If the entry fee is halved in the lean season, then the collection at the gate 

might go up substantially. The system can be tried out on an experimental basis.

 The promoter of a multi-storeyed building in Blackburn Lane, off New CIT Road, 

has taken over the garbage dump in the area by destroying the walls around it. 

Sweepers of the civic body now dump waste at the mouth of an adjacent lane, effectively 

closing it to pedestrians and vehicles. 

 Abdul Fateh Kamruddin, Lal Bazar Street. 

 The footpath in front of Lady Brabourne College has been taken over by pavement 

dwellers. In fact, the entire stretch from Park Circus is home to vagrants and 

ragpickers. The pedestrians, especially the students of the college, are forced 

to walk along the carriageway. The pavement dwellers also dirty the road. The 

stench sometimes becomes unbearable. Moreover, the street-children regularly harass 

passers-by for alms. It is high time the authorities take steps to alleviate the 

situation. 

 Priyanka Mukherjee, Address not given.

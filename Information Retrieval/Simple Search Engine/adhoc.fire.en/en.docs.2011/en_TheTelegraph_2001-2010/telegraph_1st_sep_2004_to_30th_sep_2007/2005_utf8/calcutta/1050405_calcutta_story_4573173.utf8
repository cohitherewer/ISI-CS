The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Dark distress on Metro

 - 12-minute power cut sparks panic on trains, at stations

 A STAFF REPORTER

 It was a 12-minute nightmare for commuters inside the Esplanade and Chandni Chowk Metro stations on Monday afternoon.

 Thanks to a false fire alarm, the two stations were plunged into darkness for a full 12 minutes. The scene was chaotic, as many passengers panicked, not knowing what had caused the power cut.

 Suddenly at 3 pm, the lights went out at both the stations, triggering pandemonium. 

 ?Someone reported that smoke was emanating from the surface sub-station at Chandni Chowk station. So, the electrical staff at the station switched off the power supply as a precautionary measure,? a Metro spokesperson said. However, investigations later revealed that the source of the smoke was a burning heap of garbage near the sub-station.

 Power was restored at the stations at 3.12 pm, once the officials had confirmed that nothing was amiss, the spokesperson added.

 But for the passengers, it was a scary experience. They alleged that no announcements had been made, at the stations or on the trains approaching them, about the power cut. 

 ?I got off the train at Esplanade and found the platforms very dimly lit,? said V. Kumar, a passenger. ?The authorities could have made an announcement about the power cut on the train or on the platform,? he complained.

 With only the emergency lights on, the stations were dark and the escalators were not working. ?It was suffocating, as the air coolers were still,? said Sanjeeb Mukherjee, another passenger.

 Elderly passengers, too, had to climb the staircases as the escalators had stopped functioning. There was chaos in front of the ticket counters. Passengers, confused over the sudden power cut, huddled in front of the counters, inquiring about the cause. ?The staff could not provide any information,? said L.K. Joshi, a passenger at Esplanade station.

 Those getting off at the two stations also found it difficult to move out through some of the electronic gates, as they were not working. Some managed to jump over them. 

 ?There was not a single Metro official in sight who could provide assistance,? alleged a passenger.

 Train services, however, were not disrupted, as power supply to the third rail was not affected, Metro officials said.

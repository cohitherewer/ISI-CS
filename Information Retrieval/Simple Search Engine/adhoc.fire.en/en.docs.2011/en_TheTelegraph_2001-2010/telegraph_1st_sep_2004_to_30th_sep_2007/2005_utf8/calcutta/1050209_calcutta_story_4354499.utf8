 Buck pass over fair filth

 Before the fair, the question to ask was whose Maidan is it anyway. After the fair, the question desperately seeking an answer is whose Maidan mess is it anyway?

 The 30th Book Fair is over, but a war of words has broken out over who should clean the filth of the fair. 

 Not for the first time, the Publishers and Booksellers Guild is embroiled in a blame game with the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC).

 The civic body has refused to clean up the garbage till the guild coughs up current and outstanding service charges.

 ?The guild hasn?t paid us conservancy charges amounting to around Rs 70,000 for last year?s clean-up job. It hasn?t even paid us the price for daily sweeping and supply of drinking water to the fair ground for the past three years. How can we render services if we are not paid?? demanded mayor Subrata Mukherjee.

 Civic deputy chief law officer Shaktibrata Ghosh said the Maidan did not belong to the CMC and so, the onus of cleaning the ground lay with the public works department (PWD).

 Tridib Chatterjee, general secretary of the guild, claimed the CMC had been paid conservancy charges for last year and there are ?documents to prove it?.

 On the amusement tax bill of Rs 75,000, Chatterjee said: ?This is a question of principle. We haven?t paid this tax for the past 29 years and we won?t pay in the fair?s 30th year. Paying amusement tax for the book fair would set a precedent.?

 According to PWD officials, the guild prefers the services of the civic body in clean-up operations, since the CMC charges are lower than the department?s.

 ?The PWD, along with Calcutta Police, which is the custodian of the Maidan on behalf of the army, will conduct an inspection after three days to see if the grounds are clean,? added a PWD official.

 The police commissioner, meanwhile, has written to the guild to ensure that post-book fair, the Maidan is restored to its original form.

 ?We want the guild to ensure that the space is cleared. It can be done through a private agency or through the civic body, but it should be cleaned. While giving permission, we had specifically informed the guild members about this and now, they can?t go away without doing the job,? said Prasun Mukherjee.

 But there is no sign yet of the CMC-guild deadlock being broken. So, how long will the fair ground fringes remain such a mess?

 ?Wait and watch. The CMC will have to do it eventually,? claimed Chatterjee from the guild.

 ?We will appeal to the mayor after February 10, when the stalls have all been dismantled. The Maidan must look clean. We are willing to pay conservancy charges in advance for that, but we will not pay amusement tax,? he added.

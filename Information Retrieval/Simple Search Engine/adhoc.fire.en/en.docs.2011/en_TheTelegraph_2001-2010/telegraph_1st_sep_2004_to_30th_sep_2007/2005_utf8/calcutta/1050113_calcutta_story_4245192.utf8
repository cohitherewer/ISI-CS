If you thought Thai cuisine was all about lemon grass, 

coconut milk and red or green curries, a peep into the kitchen at Baan Thai ? 

the only Thai restaurant of a five-star hotel in town ? would force a rethink.

From squid, mussel and octopus to a variety of Oriental 

vegetables, the fare is as exotic as it can get at the ?flagship restaurant? of 

the Oberoi Grand.

You do need a spirit of adventure to explore the treasures 

from the Far-Eastern food destination. Says executive chef George K. George: ?Anyone 

who wants to have authentic Thai food in Calcutta comes to Baan Thai, but most 

people stick to their favourites which they have been ordering over the years. 

I would say only about 20 per cent of our guests really experiment with the cuisine. 

Though the Octopus Stir Fry with Garlic Pepper is a real delicacy, it?s only ordered 

by some Japanese tourists.?

The main draws, apart from the food, at this 58-seater 

eatery, are the two khuntokes ? the traditional Thai home seating arrangement 

? that add to the total Baan Thai experience. Baan in Thai means home, and hence 

the name stands for a Thai home. There are two khuntokes, one seating eight 

diners and a smaller one with two four-seater arrangements, where guests are offered 

the authentic experience of floor-level seating.

The kitchen is divided into three sections ? stir 

fry, curry and salad and appetiser section ? all of which have separate teams. 

A fourth section called ?pass? controls the KOT (kitchen order ticket). Operations 

are overseen by chefs Theida and Jaan Thai.

If the two speciality chefs have been brought in from 

Thailand, so are most of the ingredients, required for dishing out the delicacies. 

Among perishables, some vegetables intrinsic to the cuisine are flown in on a 

weekly basis from exporters in Thailand.

These include lemon grass (used in most main course 

dishes and also to flavour soups), kaffir lime leaves (used in curries), 

krachai (a pungent-flavoured root vegetable used in Thai Jungle Curry), 

galangal (a white ginger-like vegetable), pea aubergine (green pea-sized 

aubergines used in green curries) and pandana leaves (used as flavourings 

for steamed rice and also to wrap chicken morsels for an appetiser called Kai 

Hor Bai Toey).

A particular kind of hot chilli called Bird?s Eye 

and a couple of other varieties of red and orange chillies are also imported.

most the whole of the grocery section comes from Thailand 

once every month. The shopping list includes coconut milk, probably the most widely 

used ingredient. Sauces include sweet chilli, soya, fish, oyster, mountain (a 

soya-based seasoning) and Sri Racha chilli (a special chilli sauce used widely 

in the cuisine). 

Various pastes like chilli, green curry, red curry, 

yellow curry, Massaman curry and Penaeng curry form the base of all the curries. 

?These pastes are sauted for a couple of hours at very low heat to let the flavours 

develop,? says chef George. 

A couple of other fruits like water chestnut and rambutan 

are also imported to be used in desserts like Khao Niew ob Krati (baked coconut 

rice and water chestnut pudding) and Ngow Ice-cream Krati Sod (rambutan served 

with coconut ice-cream).

While the meat and fish, including lobsters and crabs, 

are sourced locally, special items like squid, mussels and octopus are brought 

in from Chennai and Cochin. With the pork supply, however, the restaurant is extra 

careful. ?We get all the sensitive products from centralised units so that the 

quality is same in all the Oberoi restaurants across the country. Pork products 

being very quality sensitive, we get our sausages, bacons and pork from a delicatessen 

unit in Delhi. It?s a French certified firm that provides Yorkshire breed of the 

animal. We get our Peking ducks from the same unit,? says George.

The kitchen starts preparing for lunch from 9 in the 

morning and shuts at 3 in the afternoon, only to re-open at 7 for dinner. Pre-preparation 

includes chopping vegetables and making stock (chicken, seafood and vegetable), 

while the entire assembling and cooking is done once a guest places the order. 

?We personalise the dishes totally according to a guest?s taste. One can mix and 

match the ingredients in any manner he or she wants,? says George.

The menu comprises seven different sections ? appetisers, 

soups, grills from northern Thailand, curries, stir fries, rice and noodles and 

desserts. The selection in each section is given a total overhaul at least thrice 

a year, wherein new dishes replace the existing ones, while retaining the hits.

A menu engineering report, generated by an online 

ordering system that tracks the number of dishes ordered and revenue generated 

by each and every item, determines which dish will find pride of place on the 

next menu and which ones will be on their way out. 

Though a true-blue Thai restaurant, food festivals 

and promotions here often dish out delicacies from other parts of Southeast Asia. 

A noodle festival slated for end-February, for instance, will boast noodles from 

Korea and Indonesia as well, apart from a host of Thai varieties like flat noodles, 

egg noodles, rice vermicelli and rice noodles.

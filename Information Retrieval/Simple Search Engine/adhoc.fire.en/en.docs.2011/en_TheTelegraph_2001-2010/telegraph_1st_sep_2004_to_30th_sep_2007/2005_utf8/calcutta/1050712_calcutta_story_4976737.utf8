 Mastering cold appetisers and dim sums, Cantonese and Sichuan, Thai and Vietnamese, and also learning how to control and order stock, roster staff and develop a food safety plan?

 Eastern India?s ?first institute? for exclusive teaching and training in culinary arts and involving intricacies in Asian commercial cookery from 12 types of kitchens, is set to open its doors next month, hoping to address the marked shortage of real kitchen management skills in the industry.

 KK?s Regal Culinary Academy, set up in collaboration with Regal Academy of Tourism and Hospitality in Adelaide, Australia, will hold its theory classes at 14, Seal Lane. Practical training for students will be conducted at KK?s Fusion Global Kitchen ?N? Lounge under the guidance of technical director Pradip Rozario.

 ?Students will be awarded a joint international diploma in Asian cookery by the Regal Academy of Adelaide on completion of the one-year course, which includes practical kitchen subjects as well as theoretical and management-based subjects,? Michael F.G. Hogenbirk of the Australian institute told Metro on Monday.

 The collaborative arrangement will come in a package of support services, in the form of technical advice, course design and courseware, faculty training and faculty support, assessment and maintenance of standards. 

 Placement assistance will be provided through Regal?s Central Placement Cell at Adelaide with a global network of hotels and restaurant establishments.

 ?Worldwide, there is a dearth of trained cooks and chefs adept at restaurant and kitchen operations. Our venture in Calcutta is the first such collaborative effort in India in this area and we understand there are no such institutes with specific programmes here,? said Hogenbirk, in the city to oversee pre-rollout procedures.

 The Australian academy has underlined hygiene as the ?most critical issue? while equipping students in the basics of kitchen management. The composite course fee is Rs 1.2 lakh and on completion, a student can also apply for a six-month specialisation programme in Adelaide.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Chopper to chiller

 He chops reels by profession, but Friday will find editor Rabiranjan Moitra calling the shots from behind the camera. For his debut vehicle, Moitra has chosen the ghost film genre, which, he says, hasn?t been explored in Bengali cinema at all. With a child and his haunted doll at the centre of the all attention, Mantra also marks RPG Saregama?s much-hyped foray into Bengali film production.

 ?I had conceived this story some years ago for the STAR Plus Bestseller series, but that didn?t materialise. Now, I have rewritten it in a completely different context for the film,? says the first-time director.

The cast features Locket Chatterjee (in picture) as 

the mother of the child, Sabyasachi Chakraborty in the role of a sleuth, Soumitra 

Chatterjee playing a guru, Rajatabha Datta as the villain of the piece and Swastika 

Mukherjee in a brief but significant appearance.

 Constrained by a shoestring budget of Rs 30-32 lakh, Moitra has decided to shoot the film in sync-sound and on 16 mm to cut costs. Yet, it?s the small budget and a different film genre that Moitra wants to experiment with.

 ?We don?t really know what the market for such a film is. There have been thrillers and whodunnits but no film on the supernatural, so to say. Instead of trying out an arthouse film and the festival route or the family entertainer, I wanted to go with this genre which hasn?t been explored in Bengali cinema.?

 Though a spooky film, Mantra aims to pack in more elements of thrill than horror, as Moitra is cautious about getting the right mix of excitement and emotion. 

 ?It will be a fast-paced film. But there has to be a chemistry between the characters and emotional resonance in the content,? adds Moitra, whose last work on the edit table was Arindam Chaudhuri?s college caper Rok Sako To Rok Lo. He has also paced Buddhadeb Dasgupta?s Swapner Din, Mando Meyer Upakhyan and Uttara, and Aparna Sen?s Mr amp; Mrs Iyer. 

 And switching seats from the edit table to behind the camera is something Moitra feels has come naturally to most of his batchmates at FTII Pune. An example: Rajkumar Hirani, director of Munnabhai MBBS.

Splash style for pool perfect

to kick off, Ipsita Deb takes a plunge into the latest trends in water 

wows

With winter having barely made its mark this year, 

and summer settling in early, getting ready for that workout in the pool or just 

a leisurely dip is a great idea. Just as fashion trends change every season, swimwear, 

too, has its very own style file that constantly evolves and expands.

?The city clubs have a number of restrictions when 

it comes to the level of exposure and bikinis are rarely seen on the Indian women 

there. However, the same women shed all their inhibitions and flock to buy such 

items when going on a holiday,? reveals Dharmendra Nathwani of La Lingerie.

Goodlife takes a plunge into the world of pool 

wear?

Bathing beauties

Swimwear can broadly be classified into two categories 

? one-piece and two-piece. Both have undergone several transformations over the 

years, resulting in a great number of choices for the swimwear buyer. If the most 

common style till date is the maillot (one-piece suit), the most sought-after 

style is the bikini.

The bikini has diversified into the tankini (a sporty 

style that leaves only a small portion of the tummy exposed), the bandini (bikini 

with a bandeau ? straight, strip-like piece of fabric) and the camikini (same 

as tankini, except the top looks like a camisole).

The maillot, too, has undergone several changes and 

comes in a variety of styles. The tank is a one-piece swimsuit with a basic silhouette 

and straps, while the jogger has full shorts to hide the tummy, hips and thighs. 

Skirted is another common type, where an overskirt is attached at the waistline 

or hip. 

Where to go: La Lingerie (Forum), Naughty Nightwear 

(Vardaan Market), Sleep-ins (Theatre Road), Global Sports House (Forum), Shoppers? 

Stop.

What to pay: Rs 300 to Rs 4,000. (Branded swimsuits 

like Speedo, Adidas, Reebok, etc, and designer stuff are priced far steeper than 

the regular ones.)

Trend talk

Be it the big screen (Charlie?s Angels: Full Throttle) 

or small (Baywatch), fashion and Hollywood are trumpeting surfer girl styles. 

What was previously restricted to the ever-popular spandex, has today combined 

a variety of fabrics and forms. While mono-colours do look sleek, the stores are 

now pushing up graphic appeal in stripes, plaids and bold florals. 

One of the newest trends in the water is the ?peek-a-boo? 

exposure ? asymmetrical maillots that leave a bit of skin exposed for a sexy, 

modern look, or halter necks. Detailing like ruffles, smocking, belts, embroidery, 

lacing, fringing and visible overstitching are common. 

Tropical prints are ruling the stock. Exotic Gothic, 

Asian, desert and animal prints in an array of patterns, contrasts, shapes, and 

colours make an impact while embellishments in the form of sequins, beads, semi-precious 

stones and shells can also be found.

?I?m very experimental by nature, especially whilst 

travelling abroad. I like both one-piece and bikinis. The latter, of course, looks 

sexier!? says actress Riya Sen.

Colour collage

The basic black will perhaps never go away, but a 

collage of vibrant combination colours like bright and earthy reds, whites and 

blues, multi-shades of pink on white, burgundy flowing into gold, greens and ivory, 

turquoise blends with deep blues and greens... The list is endless. Fun florals 

in bright colours or a retro tie-dye are also very much in style. ?In the last 

two years, the fluorescent colours have came back into fashion and subdued hues 

are completely out,? says Manoj Khem of Naughty Nightwear.

Easy extras

Sarongs, in sheer fabrics and pretty prints, continue 

to be the most flattering and favoured accessory for by-the-water activities. 

Tied on the side or in front, the options are many. Even shorts, in a variety 

of styles, colours and patterns, are smart and sporty. Cargo and crop pants and 

a plethora of styles in dresses as cover-ups extend the wearability of the swimsuit 

out of water, as well.

Basic swimwear aids like goggles and swimming caps 

are required in most club pools. While eye cover, most commonly Speedo-branded, 

is priced at Rs 150-250, the head gear comes for Rs 100-150 and comes in synthetic 

fabrics and waterproof variety.

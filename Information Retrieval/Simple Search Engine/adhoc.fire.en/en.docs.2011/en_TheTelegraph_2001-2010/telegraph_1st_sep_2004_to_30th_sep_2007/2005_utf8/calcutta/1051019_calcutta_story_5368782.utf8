The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A robber?s tale

 Bengali literature of the middle ages had a complex, poetic language, rich in words with multi-layered meanings and implications. Dasyu Kenaram represents Kalyani Natyacharcha Kendras attempt to adapt this idiomatic dialect to the diction of contemporary theatre. Based on a ballad written in the 16th century by Chandrabati, it offers a vivid and colourful description of the life of common people in that age. The characterisation of Kenaram, the bandit, comes alive in his daring, adventurous exploits, as also in the expression of his unusual philosophy of life. Direction: Kishore Sengupta.

 Event: Play in Bengali, Dasyu Kenaram, by Kalyani Natyacharcha Kendra

 When: Today at 6.30 pm

 Blighty beckons pandals

 - FIRST-EVER ATTEMPT TO TRANSPORT KNOCKED-DOWN SECTIONS

 SEBANTI SARKAR

 The Mayurpankhi illumination in London

 The pandal is going places. The Puja is over, but a team of 30 makers and decorators is engaged in a pandal project of a different kind. The technique and most of the material used for the structures will be the same but these pandals will travel thousands of miles to England for the Newcastle Festival at Newcastle and Brodsworth.

 The pandal project is steered by curator Nandita Pal Chowdhury, who wants to ?make craft functional? and ?create round-the-year employment for the craftsmen?.

 This year, Blighty beckons. ?In England, there is an enormous interest in everything Indian. There is so much respect for our culture that is seen as both old and active,? says Nandita, whose suggestions for ?a project on creation of temporary space? won the approval of the English Heritage committee.

 This will be the first-ever attempt to transport knock-down pandals, stresses Nandita. The craftsmen will build the entire pandal and break it up into segments in such a way that just four or five workers can assemble it there.

 One of the pandals will be an artistic recreation using Mughal arches and minars, the other a scaled-down model of the Taj Mahal. Will there be changes in terms of material and colour schemes? ?Material, yes, as we are going to use more plywood than bamboo and stretched cloth. And the size has been limited, so that the sections can fit into a 20-ft ship container. But colours will be authentic. I won?t switch to greys and pastels just because the West is used to it. In any case, I don?t think they would want me to,? laughs Nandita.

 Associated with the Crafts Council for a while, Nandita has worked with artisans from Chandernagore to create a Mayurpankhi illumination under the direction of the mayor of London for the Thames Festival. The same illumination will be on display till November 6 at the Winter Garden, Blackpool.

 Response to the pandal project has been encouraging, with inquiries from NRIs and the Peabody Museum of Harvard commissioning three projects. ?But pandal-making is not what I plan to stick to. All I want to do is show the way so others can explore more possibilities,? says Nandita.

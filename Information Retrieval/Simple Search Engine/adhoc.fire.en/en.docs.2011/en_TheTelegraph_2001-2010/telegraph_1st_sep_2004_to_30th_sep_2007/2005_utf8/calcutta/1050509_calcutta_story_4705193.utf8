The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You cant get through this week without...

 Celebrating Rabindra Jayanti

 Give DJ music a miss for once and tune into the traditional sounds of Rabindrasangeet instead, as the city celebrates Kabigurus birthday this week. If you are not in the mood, get drenched in one of the kalbaishakhi squalls. Then, transform your inspiration into action by breaking out into a summer song by Tagore during the evening adda at Rabindra Sadan or Nandan. And with the Nobel laureates medal ? or at least a replica ? back home at Santiniketan, your timing could not be better.

 Pampering mommy

 Its not often that you get to baby her, so if you missed out on Mothers Day or think just one day is not enough to show how much you care, pamper your mother through the week. And with the marketing blitz accompanying any event these days, you are sure to have enough goodies to see you through. Start out simple with exclusive Mothers Day confectioneries available at leading stores, up the budget with some small but special diamonds, head for lunch for some true five-star pampering. And while you are there, you could never go wrong with a well-earned massage. If you are too young to earn your own dough, demonstrate your adoration in kind. Tell her to put up her feet and take on the household chores yourself, labour over an elaborate dinner, the options are endless!

 Gearing up for the fickle weather

 The rain and shine played hide and seek all through last week. So even if you dont feel up to carrying a cumbersome umbrella all the time, the least you can do is tie a wind-cheater around your waist to pull on over your spaghettis when you get caught in a sudden downpour en route to the disco. While the outfit will come in handy when the rain catches you unawares, you can pass it off as the latest fashion statement.

 Buying a telescope

 To cool off stargazing on the terrace on a sultry summer evening. With new planets being discovered 10 times the size of the Jupiter, you could also use your new purchase to indulge in a little astronomical adventure. There could finally be an upside to those endless evening power cuts.

 Chilling out in Kathmandu

 If you can ignore a little political unrest, Nepal could be just the place for you. Find the best deal ? and there are many to be found ? to help you cool off, away from the steamy city. Let not a few coups here and there scare you into emptying your bank account in the Alpine climes of Switzerland. Summer vacations in the erstwhile hippie hangout favours the brave!

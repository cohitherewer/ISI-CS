 An emotional crisis

 Human relationships are by nature fragile and prone to vulnerability. Born of our needs, emotions and sensitivities, they need to be carefully nurtured and protected. Exploring the complex and delicate nature of such relationships and the problems that arise when one fears that the stability of existing relationships may be jeopardised, Saanjhbela tells us the tale of Shrimoyee (Swatilekha Sengupta), a single mother of two teenaged children, who finds herself face to face with a severe moral crisis. When Alokesh (Meghnad Bhattacharya), with whom she shared a secret relationship in the days of her adolescence, suddenly re-enters her life, her relationship with her children is threatened and she undergoes tremendous mental and emotional upheaval. The conflicting emotions, mental agony and dilemma experienced by both Shrimoyee and her children highlight their insecurity, stress and trauma, making their predicament all the more poignant. Story: Bimal Kar. Stage adaptation: Indrasish Lahiri. Direction: Meghnad Bhattacharya.

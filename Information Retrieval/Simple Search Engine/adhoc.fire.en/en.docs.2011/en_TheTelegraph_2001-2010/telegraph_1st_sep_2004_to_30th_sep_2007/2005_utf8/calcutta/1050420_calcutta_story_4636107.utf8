 Bout of doubt

After their superlative performances in Alo, 

actor Kunal Mitra and Rituparna Sengupta will be seen together again in Songshoy. 

Produced by Avijit Banerjee and directed by Saibal Mitra, the film is based on 

a story by Narendranath Mitra. 

Set in a small hamlet called Sunthaleykhola in north 

Bengal, the story revolves around a widow (Rituparna), her six-year-old son, an 

ambitious doctor (Kunal) and an activist with leftist leanings, played by Sudipta 

Chakraborty.

 ?The objective is to make a clean and entertaining movie. The viewer should not be left with questions in his mind while coming out of the theatre. The choice of actors was made keeping the characters in mind,? said Mitra on Monday. 

 ?This is the first time I am working with Saibal Mitra but I fell in love with the role of Anita (the character she is playing) when he narrated it to me,? said Rituparna.

 Books for primary classes, published by the education department, are distributed 

free among the students of government school. Generally, the books are not distributed 

at the very beginning of the academic session. Also, books on all subjects are 

not made available at the same time. As a result, the progress of studies at the 

school suffers. The next academic year starts from May 2005. The authorities concerned 

can take necessary action now, so that the books are printed and kept ready for 

distribution in the first week of commencement of the new session. In case of 

a delay in the distribution, unscrupulous traders take advantage of the situation 

and after getting the books printed in private presses, sell them at exorbitant 

rates in the market. This malpractice will come to an end only if all the books 

are distributed in time. 

 Dinabandhu Mukherjee, Behala. 

 The problem in distribution of the books to primary schools is that of quantity 

than anything else. We have to provide books on various subjects to nearly one 

crore students every year. The matter is revised, approved and then sent to the 

printing presses. After printing, the books are sent to various district centres 

to be despatched to schools. Even small bottlenecks further extend the time-consuming 

process. This time we have sent the books for printing in December-January. The 

presses have also completed the bulk of the work. So, we are expecting that the 

books will reach the schools by April-end. The new session starts on May 2. 

 S. Bhattacharya, President, West Bengal Board of Primary Education.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Snag lift falls with 7

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A lift in free fall, from the fourth to the ground floor in a central Calcutta building, left two persons with fractures in their legs and four persons nursing minor injuries on Wednesday afternoon.

 The accident occurred at the 12-storeyed Tiretta Bazaar Telephone Exchange Building, off Lalbazar, around 1.45 pm, when the power lines were snapped after the detection of a fire in a transformer, with seven persons in the lift.

 Instead of stopping midway, the brakes of the lift failed and it plunged down from the fourth floor and came crashing to the ground.

 ?As the lift stopped with a bang, the fan gave way and fell, injuring one person seriously. Fortunately, the ropes had not given way, or else everyone inside would have died. There is a problem of maintenance of the lifts and some of the parts just gave way,? said a member of the staff at the telephone exchange.

 The injured were admitted to Calcutta Medical College.

 ?A case of negligence has been lodged with Bowbazar police and an investigation launched. Once those responsible for the maintenance have been identified, they will be booked,? said Ranveer Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 The nightmare did not end even when the lift came to a halt, as there was no one to open the doors. The liftman arrived a few minutes after the accident and then rushed off to get the keys to the lift.

 All the while, those in the lift remained trapped in darkness, wounded and shaken. By the time the doors were opened, two of those in the lift of trauma had lost consciousness.

 A section of the telephone exchange employees claimed that around 1.10 pm, a few employees had noticed smoke spiralling out of a transformer, accompanied by a pungent smell.

 The CESC authorities were alerted and around 1.45 pm, power supply to the building was switched off. It was then that the lift came crashing.

 With the snag lift out of service, 

 the building was left with just another during peak office 

 hours. ?Of the two others, one is under repair and another 

 is meant for carrying goods,? explained a building maintenance 

 staff.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 On a recent visit to Sambhu Nath Pandit Hospital, I was shocked to find the 

corridors extremely dirty. Even more disturbing was the fact that the medical 

staff and guards were not concerned about hygiene either. People were spitting 

and littering the place. The repelling sight made me decide not to take the expensive 

vaccine that I had gone there for. In Calcutta, government hospitals are no longer 

trustworthy. Our government should take a lesson from the likes of AIIMS, Vellore, 

and improve the facilities.

 Calcutta Municipal Corporation has taken the initiative to pave some of the 

city?s footpaths with moulded bricks. Pedestrians find it very convenient but 

would do the telephone company, the civic drainage department and the power utility 

approve of it? After some days, one of them might need to dig up the footpath 

to carry out repairs and then find it difficult to repair it. Has the Corporation 

tried to figure out how the underground repair work on footpaths would be done 

if the need arises?

 Mobile phones have no doubt become indispensable to most of us. But I have 

noticed that motorcyclists also talk on the cell while riding. This irresponsible 

practice not only puts the rider?s life at risk but also endangers lives of innocent 

pedestrians. Traffic policemen should stop and fine motorcyclists if they are 

found using their mobiles while riding.

 Stock exchanges and their functioning have assumed increased importance in 

the present global economy. Trading in stocks requires a lot of business acumen 

and an analytical mind. While courses and degrees on fashion designing, food processing, 

hotel management etc are being introduced in educational institutions every year, 

little importance is given to the study of the stock market. Even at the graduate 

level, commerce students learn the accounting transactions in stocks only. Universities 

here should consider the feasibility of introducing specialisations on the subject. 

 Rabindranath Kar, Sankar Ghosh Lane. 

 The number of rodents in the city, especially in the office areas, is going 

up by leaps and bounds. Even the Writers? Buildings is not immune to the rodent 

menace. The rats damage files and electric lines. Curzon Park is infested with 

rats that are regularly fed by onlookers. Steps must be taken to keep their population 

under control.

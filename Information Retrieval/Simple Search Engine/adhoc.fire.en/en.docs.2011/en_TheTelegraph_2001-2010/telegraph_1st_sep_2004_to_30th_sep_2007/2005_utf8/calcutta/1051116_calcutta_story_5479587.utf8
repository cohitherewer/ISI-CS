 Animal effect on finance and health 

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 Q: I received a pair 

 of tortoise from my friend. One is made of ceramic and the 

 other is metallic. Please guide me with the placement and 

 significance of having tortoise in the house.

 Sanjeev Ahuja

 THE SOLUTION: A tortoise 

 is considered very auspicious as the advanced branch of 

 Feng Shui, known as the Flying Stars, is derived from the 

 engravings found on its shell. 

 You can place the metal tortoise 

 with its feet dipped in water in a silver or blue plate 

 in the north of the living room. This helps attract business 

 opportunities. 

 The ceramic one can be placed 

 in a green or blue plate with some water in it, in the east 

 of the living room or the garden. Remember to change the 

 water every day. This is considered an auspicious symbol 

 of good health as it suggests longevity; the normal breathing 

 pattern of a tortoise is 15 times slower than that of a 

 human being.

 Media matters

 Q: I am going through 

 a very bad phase in my career. I will be taking my MBA entrance 

 exams this year and am interested in pursuing a career in 

 either hotel management or news reading. Please advise me 

 on my prospects and what I should do to improve them. Also, 

 I am unable to concentrate on my studies. My date of birth 

 is 04.10.83, at 9.51 am.

 Ranjeeta Poddar

 THE SOLUTION: You are a 

 weak wood person and need nourishment from the water element. 

 Water represents finance, banking, media and communication. 

 Hence, you should do well in news reading and media. 

 You have a bright future from 

 next year onwards as your weak wood element is being strengthened 

 from 2006. So surround yourself with wood and water elements 

 and their respective colours like green and blue. Keep your 

 study material in the north-east of your room and face this 

 direction while studying.

 Pay problems

 Q: I was born on 07.07.73 

 at 11.48 am in Calcutta. I have studied engineering from 

 Jadavpur University in 2001. I am working with an engineering 

 project firm, but the pay is quite poor. Please suggest 

 tips that will help me get a good job with a better salary. 

 Also, let me know my strong, weak and nourishing elements, 

 favourable colours, lucky numbers and direction.

 Raja Das

 THE SOLUTION: According 

 to your pillars of destiny, four elements of earth are extremely 

 prominent in your chart. Next year, fire and earth will 

 be in power.

 Earth represents direct wealth 

 for you and this means you can expect a promotion next year.

 You must keep the leading earth 

 element happy by surrounding yourself with and wearing earthy 

 colours like beige, cream, yellow and brown. Your auspicious 

 directions in order of preference are east, south-east, 

 north and south.

 Art appeal

 Q: My daughter and son 

 had joined an art camp during the Puja vacations. They have 

 made a number of paintings with different techniques. I 

 have recently redecorated their room and would like you 

 to guide me as to where I should place their paintings. 

 They are six and eight years old. Do the number of paintings 

 also matter in Feng Shui?

 Sushmita Ghosh

 THE SOLUTION: The western 

 part of the room is connected with creativity. So, your 

 childrens imaginative and creative art can be displayed 

 on the western wall of their room. 

 You can also display their art 

 according to the colours that are dominant in them. For 

 example, vibrant colours should be displayed on the southern 

 wall, while the north wall calls for cool and dark tones 

 of blue and black with gorgeous strokes of silver and gold. 

 The eastern wall can have paintings of nature with loads 

 of greens. 

 The north can have one picture, 

 while the fire energy of the south is given a boost with 

 nine paintings. This helps them gain name, fame and recognition 

 related with school activities. East is the family area, 

 which is energised with a group of three pictures, while 

 the west, the kids very own zone, is best strengthened 

 by displaying a group of seven paintings.

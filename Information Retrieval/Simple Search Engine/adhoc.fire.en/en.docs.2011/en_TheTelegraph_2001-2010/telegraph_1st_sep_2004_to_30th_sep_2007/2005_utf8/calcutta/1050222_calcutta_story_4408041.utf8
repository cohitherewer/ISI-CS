The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Ground reality: car chaos

It is all of 795 metres. It is touted as the traffic-solution 

tool for a vital stretch of Chowringhee. On the first weekday of the Park Street 

flyover though less chaotic because of the trade bandh -- Metro 

takes a look at why this might not be what the doctor ordered to ease the mess 

at Esplanade or ensure smooth passage near Park Street...

What are the problem points of the Park Street flyover?

The Park Street flyover in itself is a short but smooth 

ride. At least it was on Monday. But at the end of the flyover, and some way beyond, 

traffic was a mess. Travelling north to south, cars started piling up at the Jeevan 

Deep crossing. Qualitatively, there has been no improvement along this stretch 

from the days before.

Going south to north, things were a shade better on 

Monday. Except, of course, the long wait at the SN Banerjee Road crossing. So, 

the time you gained on the flyover, you lost on the ground, either approaching 

or at Esplanade.

Why is traffic coming to a halt at various vital points?

In the evening peak hour, when the rush is more south-bound, 

the southern end of the flyover is clogged. This is mainly because there is no 

divider here, allowing vehicles a free-for-all. As a result, cars coming off the 

flyover have to jostle for roadspace with competition from Park Street, Outram 

Road and Mayo Road traffic, creating a logjam.

Is there any marked improvement below the flyover, at main intersections, during 

peak hours?

Courtesy the trade bandh, traffic was less along this 

busy stretch. But even then, the space jam at all these intersections bodes ill 

for the week ahead.

What lies in store for Chowringhee on Tuesday, when traffic will be in full flow?

Some traffic snarls despite the Park 

Street flyover; some because of the Park Street flyover. 

At both ends, with more traffic hitting the terminal intersections faster, brace 

for long car queues.

From indications on Monday, there is little respite 

in store below the flyover, too.

And in the worst-case scenario, don?t be shocked if 

youre stranded mid-air for a while, on the flyover.

How will the Park Street flyover help beat the traffic chaos conundrum?

Over to Arun Kumar Sharma, deputy commissioner (traffic): 

?A more appropriate assessment would be possible on Tuesday, since the burden 

was considerably less today. But almost 35 per cent of the traffic should be taking 

the flyover. The rest will remain on the ground.

?With time, we hope, more people will take the flyover. 

There are bound to be some teething problems, but we hope the situation will improve 

over time.?

 Silence shroud on sex abuse of child

 - LACK OF AWARENESS, PUNITIVE LAWS

 Loss of innocence: Placards decrying child sexual abuse (Reuters)

 Shibnath Deb is a professor of applied psychology at Calcutta University?s Rajabazar Science College. His area of research is child abuse ? mental, physical and sexual. He has conducted a number of studies and surveys on the issue, from trafficking to institutional abuse. With him, it?s more than just an academic pursuit. Shibnath Deb was sexually abused as a child. 

 ?Our?s was a small home. When guests came to stay, I?d have to share my bed. Some of them abused me at night,? he says. So the pain, trauma, guilt and mental harassment of an abuse victim is not new to him. According to him, one in every two Indians are victims of sex abuse. ?And yet, it is an issue that we know nothing about, because data is scarce and no one wants to talk about it.? 

 Even conducting research is almost like mission impossible. Deb undertook a study among 120 child domestic workers last year, and found 11 per cent of them were victims. To get to the children, he recruited a group of boys and girls he trained in asking the right questions, and then asked them to network through their peer group. ?This is such a sensitive issue that no one wants to even acknowledge it. Yet, it is one of the most common problems in India,? asserts Deb.

 Not only is awareness lacking, but the Indian Penal Code has no laws to punish perpetrators of sexual crimes against children. Rape and trafficking are recognised crimes. But even undressing and fondling constitute child sexual abuse. At an interaction recently with Deb and Brendan McCarthaigh of the NGO Serve, organised by the youth support group Elaan, ?most of the youngsters came to me afterwards, saying they were victims?, says Deb. He is also part of UN projects on the issue, and a committee member of the NGO International Society for Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect (ISPCAN).

 At the interaction, McCarthaigh said his NGO?s telecounsellors regularly received calls from victims of child sexual abuse. ?Some come in for counselling, but healing takes at least three years. Some never return, others kill themselves.? There are organisations, in some cases run by victims themselves, serving as support groups, helping victims sometimes still suffering decades after abuse. In studies conducted by Deb and his students on the mental status of abuse victims, the result is that most suffer from guilt and shame through life, unless helped.

 Pranaadhika Sinha, founder of Elaan, was a victim of incest. She says: ?On discovering that I was a victim in 1999, and feeling rather alienated at that, I decided to carry out a little survey amongst the people I knew, just to make sure I was still ?normal?. From November 1999 to April 2005, after interviewing 530 in the 14-32 age group, I discovered some startling facts.? Like, 89 per cent were victims of abuse, of which 60 per cent occurred within the family; 20 per cent were not aware that what was happening was wrong; 90 per cent had obvious symptoms of abuse, such as eating and sleeping disorders, promiscuity, relationship issues and trouble at school and college. Around 24 per cent said although they had faced abuse as children, they felt comfortable with ?blocking? the experiences out. Previous pleas for help had resulted in them being asked to ?get over it?.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

A hark back to the roots

 Solly Solomon was born in 29, Bentinck Street. He left Calcutta in 1950 as an eight-year-old. Back in the city after 55 years, it felt ?strange and very emotional? to visit the places that were dear to him as a child, like his home and the Maidan, ?where we used to play?, with his family ? wife Pam and sons Edward and Barry, both IT professionals.

 The 63-year-old, whose full name is actually Solomon Solomon ? ?you know how New York was so good, they named the song New York, New York!? ? is a fire prevention officer in London. The Solomon family also performs with the group Rivers of Babylon, an ad hoc bunch of Jewish music-lovers based in London but with ties with India and propagating Baghdadi and Bene Israeli music.

 On Tuesday evening, the Calcutta audience at GD Birla Sabhagar lapped up the hour-and-a-half-long programme, with calls for more that prolonged the performance by 20 minutes. On their part, Rivers of Babylon was more than happy to comply, because ?this is truly, genuinely, the best audience we have ever had, and we wish we could take them along with us?.

 The music is a hark back to the traditions of the Baghdadi and Bene Israeli communities in India, mainly in Mumbai and Calcutta, who have all but migrated to other countries.

 ?We began when I was asked to recommend an Iraqi Synagogue Choir for an event in London, but there wasn?t any. So, I got together a group of friends and we performed. We have continued since,? smiled Sara Manasseh, the leader, singer and Dumbuk (a West Asian drum) player of the group, who is also an ethnomusicologist. She was born in Mumbai, and left the country in 1965.

 In Calcutta as part of the Remembered Rhythms festival, Rivers of Babylon first played in Delhi, and will proceed to Hyderabad, Bangalore, Chennai, Pune and Mumbai. The group?s repertoire includes a Jewish song in praise of Elijah the prophet with the words in Marathi and to the tune of ?a 1960s song from the Hindi film Dil Ek Mandir?. The show had a smattering of Arabic and, of course, Hebrew, with festive songs to celebrate the birth of a son, weddings and Sabbath, as well as sombre ones like one for the festival of Purim, to remember the sufferings of Jewish people under oppression.

 The distinctively West Asian sounds transported the listener to a time long gone, alive now only in parts of the world. Ahmed Abd Alrhman played lilting solos on the ?oud, a West Asian lute, while the versatile Sidney Nathan shifted from flute to Indian pipes and even Iraqi finger-clicking; Peter Shade was on the accordion and Susan Verney was with the violin. What really stole the hearts of the appreciative and highly-interactive audience was Mera joota hai Japani?

 At the end, several members of the Jewish community in Calcutta came up on stage to meet the members of the band. Solly, once again, was moved by someone who mentioned his Agarpara connection ? Uncle Moses, who worked in the cigarette factory.

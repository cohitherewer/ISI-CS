The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Goons and goof-up equal delay of 6 months 

 - CHILD HOSPITAL EXPANSION HIT

 The BC Roy Memorial Hospital for Children in Beleghata: Growth pangs. A Telegraph picture

 The extension of BC Roy Memorial Hospital for Children has been delayed by at least six months as the project has been hit by twin speedbreakers ? the faulty structure of the existing building and local musclemen.

 ?The original plan was to extend the building vertically. But it had to be abandoned after engineers found out that vertical extension would be unsafe,? said M.K. Chatterjee, medical superintendent and vice-principal of the hospital. ?We then decided on horizontal extension. The extended portion will have four spacious wards with 140 beds.? 

 The state health department had sanctioned Rs 1.82 crore for the project. Sourav Ganguly, too, had donated Rs 70 lakh to set up two speciality units. 

 PWD engineers and architects discovered that the pillars of the building were not strong enough for a vertical extension. Officials of the health department and the hospital then revised the plan. ?This deferred the project by six months. The work is now likely to be over by the end of this year,? Chatterjee said. 

 According to the plan, the extended part, on a 200,000-sq-ft area, will house a neo-natal intensive care unit and a paediatric intensive care unit. The units will have all childcare facilities, including ventilators, photo-therapy units and radiant warmers.

 Almost as soon as the work started around two weeks ago, it was stopped by a group of local toughs, who demanded that they be awarded the contract for supplying construction material. 

 The group even allegedly beat up men working at the site.

 An FIR was lodged with Phoolbagan police station and local MLA and information technology minister Manab Mukherjee was informed about the incident, said the hospital superintendent. 

 When contacted, Mukherjee told Metro: ?I have heard about the incident and I will look into it.?

 Deputy commissioner of police (eastern suburban division) Jawed Shamim said: ?I will probe the matter. The hospital authorities had sought help for an eviction drive before the extension work began and we had helped them.?

 Local residents alleged that those who had disrupted work were backed by both the CPM and the Trinamul Congress. 

 The hospital at present has 250 beds, but often it has to accommodate around 400 patients. Of the 250 beds, 40 are paying and 50 are surgical beds. According to the rules, not more than one patient can be allowed on each of these beds. As for the rest, even three patients are, at times, forced to share a single bed.

 Three years ago, when the hospital was rocked by 12 crib deaths within 72 hours, then Union health minister Shatrughan Sinha had promised more than Rs 10 crore to extend the building and instal additional facilities. The money, however, was never disbursed. 

 The authorities later considered taking loan from Hudco, but even that did not materialise.

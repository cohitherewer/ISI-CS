The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Taxis opt to return to roads

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Taxis will be back on Wednesday, after a daylong strike, but private buses and minibuses will not take to the streets till Thursday.

 On a day that saw low attendance in schools and offices, four persons were arrested while trying to disrupt traffic. 

 Three were arrested from the Phoolbagan crossing around 8.30 am and one was picked up from Mullickbazar around 11.30 am.

 Most of the 7,500 private buses, 2,000 minibuses and 30,000 taxis went off the streets on Tuesday, demanding a fare hike, reduction of motor vehicles tax and withdrawal of the cess on petrol and diesel.

 The Bengal Taxi Association decided not to continue with the strike on Wednesday following talks with the transport minister.

 Though the state-run CSTC and CTC plied 1,026 buses and 124 trams, they proved inadequate. When it was pointed out how commuters had suffered throughout strike day, Subhas Chakraborty said: ?How can 1,800 government buses substitute 10,000 private buses??

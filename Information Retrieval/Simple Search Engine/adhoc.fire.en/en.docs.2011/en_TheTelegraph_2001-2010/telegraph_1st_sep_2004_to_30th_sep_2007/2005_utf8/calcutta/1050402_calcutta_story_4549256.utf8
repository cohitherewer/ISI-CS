The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 During my visit to the Indian Museum after a long gap of five years, I was 

fascinated by the facelift given to the structure. The neatness, security arrangements 

and the hospitality of the staff was indeed impressive. However, there was a small 

glitch. The floor in some of the galleries has been made so slippery that even 

young, robust visitors may fall and get hurt. Elderly people and children face 

an even bigger challenge walking in these galleries. I request the authorities 

to give serious thought to the matter. 

 Biman Saha, Lake Town. 

 Though it is not yet peak summer, pockets of Dum Dum Park have been suffering 

regular powercuts after 6.30 pm. As a result, candidates appearing for the Higher 

Secondary examinations are unable to prepare well. The power tariffs keep increasing 

but the power utilities do not provide adequate services, especially during the 

months in which most school and college examinations are held.

 B.N. Bose, Dum Dum. 

 On most mornings and evenings, I find addicts sitting on the pavement adjacent 

to the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, on Chittaranjan Avenue, taking narcotics. 

It is shocking that the police are not taking any action against these law-breakers. 

The worrying part is that the area is frequented by hundreds of students of educational 

institutions in the vicinity. Calcutta University?s student hostel is located 

just half a kilometre away. 

 Arjun Chaudhuri, Mohesh Chaudhuri Lane. 

 One of the two escalators in the Rabindra Sadan Metro station is under repairs 

for several days. The passage leading to this only functional escalator is too 

narrow to handle the rush of passengers every time a train arrives. This may lead 

to an accident. 

 Gunjeet Wadhwa, Rai Bahadur Road. 

 My job requires me to travel across the country often. On March 13, I boarded 

the Steel Express from Jamshedpur. As I had travelled by this particular train 

earlier, I knew that it usually has a pantry car. But on this occasion, only after 

crossing Tatanagar station that we found out that the pantry car facility was 

not available. We were forced to make our own arrangements for breakfast. What 

prompted the Railways to remove the pantry car from Steel Express on March 13? 

If it was for unavoidable circumstances, the authorities should have announced 

it prior to the start of journey.

 T.R. Anand, Budge Budge.

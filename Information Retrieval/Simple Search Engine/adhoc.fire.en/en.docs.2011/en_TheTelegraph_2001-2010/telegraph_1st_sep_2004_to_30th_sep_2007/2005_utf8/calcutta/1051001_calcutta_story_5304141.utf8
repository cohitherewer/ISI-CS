The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 You are sensitive and artistic, with a complacency that can be exploited by others. You have tremendous tenacity and a depth that others envy. You are an independent thinker and generous with money, but not too realistic with personal investments. You are a good keeper of secrets, are comfortable working at a casual pace and prefer solving problems on your own. ? Kusum Bhandari

 Registrar, Jadavpur University

 At the gate of our university hangs a signboard announcing that entry of outsiders is forbidden. But that does not mean one should impose corporate-style security arrangements at the campus gate. By outsiders, one cannot mean all visitors other than students, teachers and non-teaching staff. A university offers many facilities; therefore many people come here for inquiries and academic services. There are bodies within the compound like the alumni association; a hall is rented out to external agencies. On no account should the academic vibrance that characterises a university campus be affected. It is the duty of the gatekeepers to check on visitors whenever they have a doubt. Such random checking on the premises produces results. Constant vigilance should be the watchword for everyone, not just the durwan. As for those who come here for morning walk or a game of football, we can think of an institutional permission.

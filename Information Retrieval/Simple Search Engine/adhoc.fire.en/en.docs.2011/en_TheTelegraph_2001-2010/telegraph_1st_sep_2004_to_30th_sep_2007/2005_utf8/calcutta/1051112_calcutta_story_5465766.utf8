The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Protest arena shifts off campus

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The stalemate at Jadavpur University took a new turn on Friday, with students of the engineering and technology faculty deciding to take their three-day agitation outside the campus to garner support of the public. All classes were boycotted by the agitators.

 The agitators have been protesting the issuance of arrest warrants against nine students by the Alipore court on Tuesday for allegedly assaulting policemen on the night of June 10. The cases had been filed by the South 24-Parganas police.

 A large number of students owing allegiance to the faculty of engineering and technology students? union (Fetsu), assembled in front of the university campus on Friday afternoon and staged demonstrations near the 8B bus terminal for quite some time.

 They shouted slogans condemning the authorities for lacking the initiative to dispose of the court cases. The students? agitation had started on Wednesday. 

 ?We also want the common people to know how we are being harassed by the police for an issue that has been settled months ago,? Fetsu leader Parag Banerjee said.

 The union on Friday submitted a fresh memorandum to registrar Rajat Bandyopadhyay, seeking the authorities? help in quick disposal of the court cases.

 Its members said that as the dispute regarding the June 10 incident had been settled months ago, the responsibility lay with the authorities to negotiate with the police department and get the cases disposed of. 

 ?Why should we be harassed by police for a dead issue?? a student asked.

 One of the main grievances of the protesters was that a group of policemen armed with the warrant had gone to the house of one of the nine students to arrest him. As he was not at home, the cops had allegedly showed the warrant to his parents.

 University sources said that the authorities, bowing to the students? pressure, on Friday contacted senior police officers to expedite the process of disposing of the cases.

 The South 24-Parganas police on Friday responded to the university?s request for looking into the students? grievances. The officers have reportedly expressed their inability to ensure quick disposal of the cases. 

 ?We understand the students? worries. We are contacting senior officials in the government and doing the needful to ease the situation,? registrar Bandyopadhyay said.

 The agitating students fear the nine students will face difficulties in getting jobs in big companies and also in going abroad for higher studies if the court cases drag on.

 Eight of the students appeared before the court on Thursday and were granted bail.

 Revival chant for Tagore show

 Rabindranath Tagore: Alive in light-and-sound

 Rabindra Bharati University has undertaken a move to repair and restart the light-and-sound show on Rabindranath Tagore on the Jorasanko campus.

 The university has assigned Ashok Mukherjee, professor of the drama department, for the job and assured him of all cooperation and financial help to resume the show.

 Mukherjee, according to registrar Santosh Kumar Ghorai, has been asked to seek help from Tagore scholars. ?The new show will be on a much bigger scale than the previous one and funds will not be a problem,? Ghorai asserted.

 The show on ?Bengal Renaissance and Tagore House?, on the sprawling lawns of the Jorasanko campus, was introduced in 1998. Visitors had to pay an entry fee of Rs 10 each.

 The equipment for the show was damaged thrice. Underground electric wires were rendered inoperative after the authorities erected a huge pandal on the lawns for the annual convocation and to observe Tagore?s birthday in May this year. Since then, the show has not been held.

 Mukherjee said he would submit an elaborate plan for the repairs. ?I am planning to change the theme from Bengal Renaissance and Tagore House to Thakurbari O Swadeshi Andolon. I feel people will be drawn towards the new topic,? he added.

 Mukherjee will also try to find out the exact cause of the damage to the wires and take measures to rectify the faults.

 It took more than Rs 15 lakh to introduce the show in 1998, when Subhankar Chakraborty was vice-chancellor of the university. The idea of a light-and-sound show, then rare in eastern India, was the brainchild of Chakraborty?s predecessor, Pabitra Sarkar.

 Mukherjee said that after studying in detail the problems of running the show, he would take at least four months to fix the snag. ?I will also involve some Tagore scholars to make the show more attractive.?

 It is learnt that the university authorities had suggested that Mukherjee consult Debnath Banerjee, a Tagore researcher, before reintroducing the show. ?Mukherjee is free to consult any Tagore scholar, even from abroad, for making the show more attractive,? Ghorai said. The open-air show is held throughout the year, except in monsoon.

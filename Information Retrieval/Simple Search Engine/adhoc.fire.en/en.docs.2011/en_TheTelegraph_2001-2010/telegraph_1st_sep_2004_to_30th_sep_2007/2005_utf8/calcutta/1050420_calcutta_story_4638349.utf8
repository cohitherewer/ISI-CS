 Poila Baisakh will never lose out to New Year?s Day. The intellectuals of Bengal, Tripura, Bangladesh and all other places where Bengalis stay will not let that happen. The energy and excitement that surrounds Nava Varsha is unmatched by anything on January 1. In College Street on Poila Baisakh, shops like ours are filled with buyers from the districts, autograph-collectors as well as authors. The adda this year continued from 10 am to late in the evening. The Book Fair may have upstaged Poila Baisakh as the biggest occasion to release books, but even then, 10 books were launched from my shop alone this time. People are more habituated to the Gregorian calendar. The financial transactions have also shifted to the April 1-March 31 cycle. But Lord Ganesha and Mother Lakshmi step into the shop on Poila Baisakh.

Book bonanza

Leafing through pages now has an added incentive at 

Park Street?s popular destination Oxford Bookstores. A month-long sale continues 

there till March 20. Customers now can enjoy 10 per cent off on all books. And 

there are lots of books for which the discount doubles or trebles. Bestsellers 

like Amitav Ghosh?s The Hungry Tide is 25 per cent off while Dan Brown?s 

The Da Vinci Code is 15 per cent cheaper. The Complete Sherlock Holmes 

from Bantam Classics (tagged at Rs 312) and Harry Potter carry a 15 per cent discount. 

?We are getting fresh stocks every weekend,? says store manager Swagat Sengupta. 

?The hottest takeaways are the hardback classics (from A Tale of Two Cities 

to Three Men in a Boat) in faux leather cover at Rs 125 a piece, at more 

than 80 per cent discount. There is another table of bestsellers at Rs 149 which 

are clearing out fast. Children?s books are selling well too.? Sengupta recommends 

the Guinness Book of World Records, priced at Rs 1,500 and selling for 

Rs 392, as a good bargain.

It is not just prices of books that are up for a cut. 

A 10 per cent discount is there on a CD of Tagore?s writings and a CD-RM of his 

songs. The discount is the same for stationery. Tea bags of various prices are 

selling at 40 per cent off. 

There is more than the usual stock in store. Over 

1,000 titles including fiction as well as those on cookery, hobbies and lifestyle, 

children, photography, art and architecture have been sourced for the annual sale. 

There are added value gains for the shopper using a HSBC credit card ? an extra 

10 per cent off on the total purchase value.

Sourav?s and Nik Nish will gift vouchers to buyers 

who get lucky. Senco has come on board to present the winner with diamond jewellery. 

Representatives from Technova Imaging Systems will be present to click images 

with a digital camera or a mobile phone on Saturdays and Sundays. Customers get 

a gift of a print-out of their photograph.

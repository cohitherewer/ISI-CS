The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 City starting point for game rage

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 Move over Ragnarok, Astonia 3 is here.

 Many may not be familiar with either of these names, but the avid videogamer will boot up his PC at the mere mention of these magic words.

 Ragnarok is one of the world?s most popular Massively Multiplayer Online Game (MMORPG), that debuted in India last year.

 Now, it?s time for Astonia 3, another multiplayer online game climbing the popularity charts with a dedicated band of followers, to woo gamers in town.

 Intent Software, the German developer of Astonia 3, has just tied up with city-based Descon Limited to market the game here.

 ?We see a huge potential in India which has such a large English-speaking population,? said Alexander von der Geest, managing director of Intent Software, in the city to sign the deal with Descon.

 The game is set in the magical world of Astonia, which each player enters as a warrior or a ?mage?. He then embarks on a quest, discovering places, killing monsters, gaining in strength and acquiring new objects.

 The game is entirely played online among players from different parts of the world.

 Astonia 3 can be downloaded for free and tried out for about a month, after which a player needs to pay for it. But unlike the international model, which charges a monthly subscription of around $10 to access the game, Intent Software is taking a different route in India.

 ?We want to popularise the game here and we realise that the $10 fee might be a deterrent. So we are offering scratch cards of low denominations,? said von der Geest. The cards start at Rs 45 (for 12 hours of gameplay), and go up to Rs 435 for a month?s access.

 ?We are talking to PC distributors and shopping malls in the city to make the coupons available in the next 10 to 15 days,? said S. Radhakrishnan, managing director, Descon. ?We want to start with Calcutta and then market the game in the rest of the country.?

 Astonia 3 ? online for two years ? has an active user base of ?around 5,000? with players in the US, Canada, UK, Australia and European countries.

 ?Compared to Ragnarok, the numbers are small,? admits von der Geest. ?But our gaming community is very passionate and on an average each player spends a year with us.?

 From India, the company plans to add ?a couple of thousand players? by next year.

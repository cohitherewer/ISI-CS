 ATM cash vanishes

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A sum of Rs 20,000 disappearsed from the automated teller machine (ATM) account of a man in May. He still cannot figure out how the money was siphoned off. The bank, too, is looking for an answer, while investigations have revealed that 22 people in the city ? all customers of the same bank ? have been defrauded. 

 Now the bank and the police have launched a joint probe into the matter. Avinash Sharma, an MBA aspirant, went to an ATM of a private bank at Burrabazar on May 3 and withdrew Rs 100. ?I had Rs 24,800 in my account with a branch of the bank near Lalbazar. But when the slip came out, I was astonished to find that I had only Rs 4,700 left in my account. Initially, I thought it was a mechanical problem but subsequent statement slips from the ATM, too, showed the discrepancy,? said Avinash. 

 Soon, he told his brother-in-law Dinesh Sharma, a city-based businessman, about the problem. He advised Avinash to lodge a complaint with the branch. ?Though a woman, who was sitting at the bank counter, initially refused to accept my complaint, later she obliged,? Avinash recalled. 

 The next day, Dinesh and Avinash went to the branch of the bank and found that the credit in Avinash?s account was actually Rs 4,700. The bank authorities asked Dinesh to wait for a few days because they were initiating an inquiry, after which the amount would be credited to Avinash?s account. ?I waited for a few days, but found they were doing nothing. So I lodged a complaint with Burrabazar police station after a week,? Dinesh said.

 Thereafter, Dinesh left the country on a business tour, only to come back this week to find that the bank had been sitting on the matter. ?They had done nothing. Whenever I call them, they say the inquiry is underway,? he said.

 The bank authorities are tight-lipped about the developments. ?All I can say is that the money has been taken out one way or another. Avinash may not be aware of it. If the money can be recovered, we will credit the amount to his account,? a senior officer said.

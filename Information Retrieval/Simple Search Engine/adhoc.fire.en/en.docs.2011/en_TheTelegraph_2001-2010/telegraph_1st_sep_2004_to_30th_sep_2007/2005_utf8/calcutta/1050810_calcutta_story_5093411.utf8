The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Whip cracked on park encroachers

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Taking a cue from the chief minister?s plans to add to Calcutta?s greenery, the city civic board has adopted a tough stand against construction work in its parks or on vacant plots being traditionally used as a park by local residents. 

 On Tuesday, mayor Bikash Bhattacharya reportedly directed mayoral council member (parks and gardens) Faiyaz Ahmed Khan to ?demolish all unauthorised constructions in parks?. 

 Illegal constructions by clubs at Harish Park, in Bhowanipore, and at Parnasree Park, on Parnasree Road, Behala, had recently been brought to the notice of Khan by the officers in parks and gardens wing of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC).

 At Harish Park, it has been alleged that a tree was trimmed substantially to make room for the construction of a club. 

 Local councillor Ratan Malakar has requested Khan not to pull down the construction.

 In Behala, the construction work is in progress by Parnasree South Block Club on CMC land outside Parnasree Park.

 Local Trinamul Congress councillor Sova Ghosh and borough chairman Anjan Das pointed out that the club has been in existence for a number of years and its office was only being converted to a pucca structure. They felt that since the surrounding area is uninhabited, the club would make passers-by feel more secure in the evening.

 Borough chairman Das also asserted that the size of the room being constructed was well within the permissible limit set by the CMC. 

 Mayor Bhattacharya commented on Tuesday that parks have become the soft targets of groups with vested interests.

 ?Civic parks are public property and people, irrespective of their social status, are free to use them. But some people, in the name of setting up clubs, are taking over parts of park land,? he regretted. As examples, he cited Rabindra Sarobar, the Park Circus maidan, Deshapriya Park, Deshbandhu Park and Tallah Park.

 According to mayoral council member Khan, most of the 136 parks in the city have been encroached upon in some way or the other.

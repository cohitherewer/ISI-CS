The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Filmi Funda 

Sholay (1975)

Director Ramesh Sippy

 Cast Sanjeev Kumar, Amitabh Bachchan, Dharmendra, Amjad Khan, Hema Malini, Jaya Bhaduri

 Plot Thakur (Kumar) recruits two small-time thugs Jai (Bachchan) and Veeru (Dharmendra) to plot a personal vendetta against dacoit Gabbar Singh (Amjad).

 The role of Gabbar was first offered to Danny 

Denzongpa, but Danny couldn?t do the film because he had already given bulk dates 

to Feroze Khan?s Dharmatma.

 The role of Jai was first offered to Shatrughan 

Sinha before it went to Bachchan.

 Director Manmohan Desai was first approached 

by the writing duo of Salim-Javed to direct Sholay but Desai was busy directing 

Chacha Bhatija then.

 In the original ending, Thakur kills Gabbar. 

But the Indian Censor Board objected, fearing the impact it would have on young 

minds. So, a new ending was created that showed the police arriving at the last 

moment and arresting Gabbar. 

 Sholay broke Kismet?s record 

of the longest-running Indian film ever. Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge finally 

broke Sholay?s record.

Kingdom of Heaven (2005)

 Director Ridley Scott

 Cast Orlando Bloom, Eva Green, Liam Neeson, Jeremy Irons

 Plot A monumental epic of tolerance, honour and humanity, the film is set against the world-shaping Crusades where a French blacksmith rises to knighthood and embarks upon a life-changing journey to find peace and a better world.

 The film was shot in northern Spain at the 

spectacular Loarre Castle, a mountaintop fortress of the 11th century. Other Spanish 

architecture showcased in the film include Avila?s inspiring cathedral, Segovia?s 

Valsain Wood, Cordoba?s Mezquita and the Casa de Pilotas, a replica of Pontius 

Pilate?s Jerusalem home. Ouarzazate and Essaouira in Morocco were used to recreate 

the Holy Land.

 The film is based on the accounts of William 

of Tyre (1130-1185), a chancellor to the kingdom of Jerusalem, as well as the 

personal tutor of Baldwin IV. Also, the works of Lyon Eracles (an anonymous French 

chronicler), and many Islamic writers like Imad-ad-Din and Usama Ibin Munquidh 

were used for research.

 In reality, Baldwin, the leper king, died in 

1185 at the age of 24, a year before the start of the story in the film.

 Bloom gained 20 pounds for his role in the 

film and suffered from a month-long flu during the shooting.

 Hans Zimmer, known for his score in Face-Off 

and Broken Arrow, was originally chosen as the film?s composer but was 

finally replaced by Harry Gregson-Williams.

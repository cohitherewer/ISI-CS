 Man gets daughter, custody tussle ends 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Family court principal judge Arup Das on Thursday granted custody of seven-year-old Aishwarya to her father Lt-Col R. Girish, a doctor from Pune, now working at Command Hospital, Calcutta.

 Girish?s wife Sibyan Mohan, against whom he had filed divorce proceedings, is absconding with their nine-year-old son Akshay. Sibyan is a doctor and associated with a private laboratory in Pune.

 Following an order of the family court, the Pune commissioner of police had sent a team to Sibyan?s residence, but failed to locate the two. The cops, however, recovered Aishwarya from a cr?che. She was produced before the family court on Thursday.

 The legal battle over the custody of Akshay and Aishwarya broke out after the relations between Girish and Sibyan soured around eight years ago, when Girish was transferred to Calcutta. Sibyan decided to stay back in Pune with their children.

 But Girish, according to his lawyer Pradip Roy, wanted to be with his family and urged his wife to come over to Calcutta with their children. 

 ?Sibyan agreed to the proposal and asked Girish to arrange for their children?s education here. Accordingly, my client went to Pune to bring his family to Calcutta, but did not find his wife and daughter at home. Only Akshay was there with Sibyan?s parents.?

 Girish came back with his son and got him admitted to a school in Calcutta. 

 ?Sibyan then filed a divorce case in a Pune family court and demanded custody of the son. My client moved the Supreme Court, seeking transfer of the case to Calcutta. The plea was granted,? counsel Roy said.

 To carry out an earlier order of the city family court, Sibyan once came here with her daughter. ?At that time, the court had allowed her to take custody of the son for only seven days,? Roy added. 

 Sibyan then left Calcutta with the two children and has been absconding since.

 Despite repeated orders, she did not produce the children before the court. ?A week ago, the court had asked Pune commissioner of police to find her and produce her, along with the children, before the judge,? Roy said.

 On Thursday, Pune police informed the judge: ?After a massive search, we could only find Sibyan?s daughter in a cr?che. Neither she nor her son could be traced. Even her parents were not at home.?

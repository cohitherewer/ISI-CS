 Marvellous machines

 PRASUN BHATTACHARYA

 Imagine a device like a human hand, capable of performing complicated surgery with more precision than the most adroit of surgeons. Or, a robot climbing up the stairs and dousing a fire on the 12th floor of a 20-storeyed building. 

 You may see such marvels right here in Calcutta, if the extensive research undertaken by Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur, in mechatronics and robotics continue yielding results as it did in the past few months.

 ?Mechatronics is the field of technology that deals with electronically controlling a mechanical device and is a rather new subject. This can revolutionise the way we live, or even die,? explained Subhasis Bhaumik, lead researcher of the mechatronics and robotics unit of the university?s department of applied mechanics.

 To popularise this field and make people aware of the capabilities of machines based on this technology, the university has launched an elaborate campaign. 

 ?We are planning to invest around Rs 2 crore to set up a school of mechatronics and robotics on our proposed second campus. Initially, a post-graduate degree in the subject will be awarded to 20 students,? said Biswanath Datta, dean of research.

 Besides, the university plans to launch a big campaign to involve industry in its research. 

 ?Without the industry?s involvement, such research cannot be financially viable,? Datta said. 

 He added: ?Indian engineering industries are still not aware of the limitless applications of mechatronics. We will hold a series of seminars and workshops on the subject jointly with industry to spread awareness of mechatronics.? 

 Lead researcher Bhaumik and four of his co-researchers have already developed machines based on mechatronics that can revolutionise the way we work. 

 Already, around Rs 91 lakh has been invested to set up two laboratories of mechatronics and the two devices Bhaumik and his team developed.

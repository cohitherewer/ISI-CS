The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Court bar on smear protests

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Do agitating employees of an establishment have the right to make personal attacks on any individual during a demonstration? 

 No, says Calcutta High Court, which, on Thursday, in a significant observation, stated that no agitating employee had the right to use abusive language or make slanderous remarks against any individual.

 The court, however, made it clear that ?employees have the right to raise their grievances, but care should be taken to use temperate language? during demonstrations or agitations on or outside a premises.

 The observation comes as a surprise in Bengal, synonymous with agitations and demonstrations, when political parties without fail resort to personal slander. However, with Thursday?s observation, a rethink on the whole issue has got underway.

 The first step in this direction was taken after the high court, in recent directives, clarified that it would never justify gheraoes and personal slander during demonstrations. In another judgment, Justice Amitava Lala of Calcutta High Court in September 2004 had sought to restrict rallies on city roads during working days.

 On Thursday, the court announced its observation while handling a defamation suit moved by Phoenix Yule Limited, a joint-venture company of Andrew Yule Limited and Phoenix AG Germany, alleging that the staff association had made personal attacks on company executives.

 The joint-venture agreement, approved by the Centre, details how the existing workforce of the belting division of Andrew Yule will be taken care of and includes their pay-scale.

 With the clauses yet to be ratified, the staff launched protests and rallies. Angered by the personal attacks made during the movement, the company filed a defamation suit against the employees, alleging that they were resorting to slander to press their demands. 

 The company had taken serious exception to the manner in which the employees drafted protest letters against the company, containing personal attacks and slander.

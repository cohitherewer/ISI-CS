The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 We Ask You Answer

 Strain on coffers, annually

 Each week, Metro asks its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses are published every Wednesday. Today?s question: Should civic polls be held every year? More responses will be printed next week

 the polls are drawing near. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya

 Milon Chakraborty,

 Proper functioning of a civic 

 body is vital. Hence, too much stress should not be laid 

 on polls and winning the majority. Election every year is 

 simply not acceptable. Instead, a body must be constituted 

 through polls to monitor civic performance. If it finds 

 that the board is not doing its duty, then it should invite 

 the Opposition to take over. 

 Arunava Bose Chowdhury, 

 Barrackpore

 A five-year term gives a civic 

 board enough time to undertake welfare activities. If elections 

 are held every year, the board would not be able to implement 

 projects. Moreover, considering the fact that several projects 

 are stalled midway due to lack of funds, the idea of holding 

 elections every year is baseless and illogical.

 Prasanta Kumar Ghosh, 

 Barasat

 It is better to be pragmatic than try out preposterous ideas. Holding civic elections every year is absurd. Our government is not flush with funds and organising polls every year is one sure way of draining the exchequer. Ultimately, the public will feel the pinch. Civic elections should be held every five years with provision to suspend the municipality or corporation for gross irregularities.

 Debashis Pathak, 

 Sura Cross Lane

 Civic polls should not be held every year for several reasons. The most important are that our treasury cannot afford it and the civic boards would stop planning long-term in such a scenario. It is well known that councillors and commissioners line their pockets for the first few years of their term before doing some work as the polls approach. With elections every year, they won?t find time to do civic work after taking care of their own interests. 

 Kaushik Guha, 

 SN Road

 When a party or an alliance forms the civic board after elections, it gets complacent and forgets about its responsibilities. Whatever little work it does, is done months before the next elections. If civic polls are held every year, then the board will have to remain on its toe for the duration of its term.

 Sourish Misra,

 Salt Lake 

 Never. Organising an election involves huge expenditure. Since we only have corrupt politicians to chose amongst, there is no need to hold polls every year. Also, elections have become synonymous with violence, and they should be held as rarely as possible to avoid unnecessary loss of lives.

 Tarun K. Bose, 

 Konnagar

 Holding civic polls every year will not solve the problem of inefficient and corrupt people coming to power. Instead, the eligibility criteria for contesting elections could be made more stringent. 

 Moumita Nandi,

 Behala

 If elections are truly meant to protect democratic rights, civil polls should be held every year. That will provide the public with the opportunity to judge a councillor before giving him or her an extension. At the same time, politicians would find it difficult to go back on their promises in such a situation. 

 Indranil Sanyal,

 Dhakuria

 No, a year is not enough evaluate the performance of a councillor. An elected candidate should be given at least three years to show his prowess. The present tenure is too long and invites complacency. Contrarily, frequent change of civic board might prove to be detrimental to the development of an area. The huge expenses involved in conducting polls should also be kept in mind. 

Kalyan Ghosh,

 Park Street

 Holding polls every year will put a heavy burden on the exchequer as well as the infrastructure. Five-year terms are ideal for civic boards since it needs adequate time to complete projects. However, a system of sacking councillors for non-performance and misdeeds needs to be introduced. Such rules should also be applicable for members of Parliament and the state legislatures. 

 Ajit Kumar Das,

 Howrah

 No. Arranging polls is a headache for the authority as it requires money and manpower.

 Pijush Nandi, 

 Barasat

 With the Calcutta Municipal Corporation elections days away, walls in the city have been defaced. Loudspeakers are also being used by the candidates at all times of the day and night. This because, the political parties lack the basic civic sense. Polls every year would only add to the woes of the citizens. 

 Rajarshi Ghosh,

 Suryanagar

 It would be ridiculous to hold civic elections every year. It is true that if the polls are held annually, the elected representatives would work more efficiently, but it would also mean a huge burden on the exchequer. Ultimately. the expenditure would be passed on to the citizens, causing immense difficulties.

 Sushma Jalan,

 Alipore

 Holding civic polls every year is not going to benefit anyone as a year is not enough for any candidate to prove his or her merit. At the same time, most of the councillors hardly do any work for their ward and spend the five years in pursuing their own ends. I feel the elections should ideally be held at two-and-a-half years interval.

 Sayan Banerjee,

 Belgachhia

 Conducting polls is an expensive affair, both in terms of time and money. Starting a few months before the polls, political parties, including the councillors, devote their full time and energy on campaigning, instead of work. Taxpayers suffer as developmental work comes to a standstill and their hard-earned money is wasted. Yearly polls would mean more suffering for the taxpayers. Surely sensible citizens would prefer to have their money spent for more constructive purposes.

 Jayanta Datta,

 Chinsurah

 If the civic polls are made an annual affair, the government will not be able to bear the expenditure. For instance, the rent for the electronic voting machines alone for the Calcutta, Salt Lake and Uttarpara civic polls is Rs 5 crore. If the election expenditure goes up, development projects will suffer as a result. In fact, it would be a good idea to elect the civic board through indirect votes.

 Sarajeet Kanungo,

 Bosepukur

 A civic body must have enough time and freedom to implement its projects. Civic polls every year would lead to projects being abandoned midway and waste of public money on campaigning and conducting elections. A civic board should be retained for at least two years.

Dipro Ray,

 Beniapukur

 Conducting civic polls every year is not going to improve Calcutta much. Even the best of candidates would need time to settle down and understand the problems of the city before doing some constructive work. Annual elections would deny them that opportunity, besides resulting in huge expenditure.

Sohini Roy,

 Sarat Chatterjee Avenue

 Civic polls should be held every year. A year?s time is enough to figure out what the winning candidate is up to. Before polls, political parties promise a lot, but the promises are never fulfiled. Annual elections could help prevent that to an extent.

Shiv Shanker Almal,

 Lower Rawdon Street

 Civic polls should be held every three years. One year is too short an interval, while five years is too long. 

 Indranil Sengupta,

 Salt Lake

 I dont think it would be a good idea to hold civic elections every year. This would not result in development of civic areas as the councillors won?t get enough time to do such work. Three years is the ideal interval between two civic elections as that won?t allow the councillors to relax too much.

 Rimli Datta,

 Salt Lake 

 Civic polls every year is a good idea. A five-year tenure is too long and the elected representatives take their position for granted and stop doing developmental work. Regular elections will surely keep them on their toes.

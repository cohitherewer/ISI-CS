 Stamp on fight against killer tobacco

 Even as the government?s ban on smoking in public places continues to be flouted with abandon, another World No Tobacco Day is upon us. And efforts continue to be made to curb the march of the killer stalker.

 This year, a novel touch is being added to the tobacco talk on May 31. Stamps and matchbox covers will help spread the message of the menace. A presentation will be made on Tobacco: The Killer, where objects associated with popular hobbies will punctuate statistics on the deathly march at a seminar organised by Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute (CNCI).

 ?Every 40 seconds, one Indian dies of tobacco-related diseases. Worldwide, the statistic is one death every 6.4 seconds,? points out Utpal Sanyal, head of the department of anticancer drug development at CNCI and a philatelist since age 12. 

 Rotary Sadan is the venue of the seminar over which health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra and minister of state, health and family welfare, Pratyush Mukherjee will preside. ?Representatives of all coordinate departments ? primary and school education, home and social welfare ? are being invited as well so that the gathering acts as a platform from where a definite plan of action can be formulated to deal with the tobacco menace in Bengal,? CNCI director Indira Chakravarty states.

 The institute houses the state?s only Tobacco Cessation Clinic. It is supported by the government of India and the World Health Organisation.

 Sanyal, a joint principal investigator at the clinic, has been using his hobby to spread awareness among school and college students. He points out that stamp-collection is popular among children while matchboxes are directly linked to cigarettes. ?About 60 per cent smokers take up the addiction at the age of 18-20 years. A presentation comprising only tables and charts can be boring for them. So I try to combine education and entertainment.? 

 His collection is based on four themes ? cancer, AIDS, smoking and blood donation. Of these, he owns around 50 stamps and 20 matchboxes on the travails of smoking alone. 

 From philately, Chakravarty hopes to move on to other activities, including on-campus operations. But for now, Tuesday has to be the start.

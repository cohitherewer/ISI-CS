 In the dark about death

 - First-ever meet on the rights of terminally-ill patients 

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 More than 95 per cent patients suffering from terminal diseases in the city are kept in the dark about their health status. 

 Some doctors, taking advantage of medical confidentiality, continue issuing ?commercial? prescriptions, which do not help the patients. Although medical laws clearly specify that patients have a right to know the diagnosis, information is often withheld even from close relatives.

 This situation may change after July 10, when doctors get together in a first-ever brainstorming session to address the question of recognising a terminally-ill patient?s right to information. 

 In Calcutta, according to rough estimates, there are 10,000-plus terminally-ill patients suffering from diseases as varied as cancer, non-responsive chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, AIDS, drug-resistant tuberculosis and several degenerative neurological afflictions.

 ?Ideally, people suffering from terminal diseases should be informed about the pitfalls, the economic profile and the outcome of the disease, but only in a handful of cases does a patient come to know how long he will live. He does not even get a chance to fulfil his wishes. We are planning to change the unwritten laws in the city?s medical history,? said oncologist Subir Gangopadhyay, who has taken the lead in this endeavour.

 Asutosh Banerjee is one such cancer patient, who recently died after incurring a Rs 20-lakh debt for treatment. ?It was a terminal case and no medicine on earth could have saved him, yet the truth was not revealed to him at all,? said Gangopadhyay.

 Recently, a group of doctors tried to initiate a psychological counselling session for terminally-ill patients at Subodh Mitra Memorial Hospital, but psychologists were in for a shock when they learnt that none of the 20-odd terminally-ill patients had any clue to their ailments. 

 ?We have seen from several surveys conducted in the past that patients who are told about the outcome of the diseases can handle the disease and treatment much better than those who are kept in the dark, as anxiety disorders and acute depression set in. But we should try and change that now,? said psychiatrist Indranil Saha.

 Apart from doctors, cancer survivors, their families, human rights activists and government officers will be present at Bangla Akademi, where a consensus will be reached to change the way terminally-ill patients are treated.

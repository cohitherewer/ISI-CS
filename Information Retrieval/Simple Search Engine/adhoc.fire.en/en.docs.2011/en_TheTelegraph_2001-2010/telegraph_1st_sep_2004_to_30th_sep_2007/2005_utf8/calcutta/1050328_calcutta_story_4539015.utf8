The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Tee-off time on city greens

I might not be actively involved in sports, but I 

am a woman with a sporting attitude,? smiles Sushmita Sen. And city fans of the 

Bengali belle will be able to see this for themselves on Monday night, as Sushmita 

is all set to dazzle them at a sporty do. The actress will grace Royal Calcutta 

Golf Club (RCGC), to launch the world?s ?first professional golf watch? from the 

house of TAG Heuer. 

 The preview of the watch will be followed by a TAG Heuer Precision Putting Challenge at the same venue. Speaking to Goodlife from Mumbai, Sushmita said: ?The limited edition golf watch, designed and developed by Tiger Woods, has been made beautifully for the purpose, with attention to specific details so a golfer will be comfortable wearing it while playing.?

 While the beauty queen is happy playing brand ambassador to a golf product, Sushmita?s stint with the sport ends at teeing off a tournament in Delhi some time ago.

 ?I was inaugurating the event with Kapil Dev and I took him aside and told him that he has to teach me to tee off so I don?t make a mess in public. He taught me and that?s where my association with golf ends. My father plays golf actively but, I must admit I?m not a big follower of the game,? she confesses. 

 If golf doesn?t interest the lady, Formula One racing definitely finds her favour. She has been hooked to the game for the past couple of years and finds it ?extremely glamourous and exciting?. An athlete during her school years and a state-level badminton champion in college, the latest addition to Sushmita?s sport list is polo. ?My association with TAG Heuer has taught me a lot of things, including how to play polo,? she laughs.

 If the Main Hoon Na girl is not too passionate about sports, she definitely gets wound up about watches. ?I respect and value time, so watches are very important for me. You will find clocks in every room of my house,? she reveals.

 But the visibility factor matters more to her than the look of a watch. While big dials and metallic frames appeal, she values the simplicity of a timepiece. ?I have always liked men?s watches more than women?s. Simple and classic looks appeal to me. I?ll be designing a watch with TAG Heuer soon,? she adds.

 Sushmita is very particular about the labels she endorses. ?In my 10 years in showbiz, I have endorsed just six brands. I have to be very sure about the brand to lend my name to it. And I don?t endorse products through films usually. If there is a sponsored item that has to be shown off, it remains in the background, not on my person,? she stresses.

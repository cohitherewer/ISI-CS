The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Small talk

Just the weekend to get a sizzling barbecue going. 

And if it?s going to be a contribution party, here?s our cackle to keep crackle 

company, hoping you?d invite us next time!

Celeb succour

It takes all kinds to make the world. While the Schumachers 

were forthcoming with tsunami fund money that ran way ahead in the compassion 

race, home-grown ?richest Indians? like Lakshmi Mittal could muster ?only? 1 million 

dollars. ?And boy, it took the man (said to have spent more than Rs 200 crore 

on his daughter?s wedding) a good 18 days, no less, to fork out the sum,? should 

be a legitimate pique. For a steelier paw paw, you can steer it into the charity 

dos? court, what with a question mark on the generous intent of superstars like 

Madonna, Stevie Wonder, Eric Clapton, Elton John and a string of Hollywood celebrities. 

?At least it?s better than raising money for a cause that is suspect,? could be 

one standpoint. Based, of course, on a Fox TV commentator?s allegation that not 

all the money raised in the television benefit show for victims of the Asian tsunami 

will go to the needy. There is the option of course, to side with the gorgeous 

George Clooney, one of the organisers of the telethon scheduled for Saturday on 

NBC, hitting back with a letter accusing ?Reilly of creating a fuss for his own 

personal gain. 

Split spat

It sure is sad when love birds split in the season 

of mists, but Brad Pitt fans can?t help but rejoice at this one. The sexy superstar 

has finally parted ways with wife of four-and-a-half years, Jennifer Aniston. 

Feminists in the gang, though, will have to grin for another reason altogether. 

Reports that the couple broke up because Brad, 41, wanted kids, while Aniston, 

35, wanted to concentrate on her career, could call for a round of applause on 

a girls? night out.

Elaan elan

The hunk factor in Elaan scores way above chick 

chic and girls just have to drool. Keep a couple of tissues handy as you go slurp 

slurp over the star cast of Elaan, the latest from Vikram Bhatt?s stable. 

Arjun Rampal and John Abraham are the guys to check out while Rahul Khanna and 

the erstwhile macho man Mithun Chakraborty will find takers, too. Guys must make 

do with Amisha Patel and Lara Dutt. The film itself sounds like the usual potboiler, 

so you?d better restrict your gush to the star quotient if you want to project 

a discerning eye. You can spare one more brownie point, though, for exotic shots 

taken in Switzerland, Russia, France, Italy and other virgin territories.

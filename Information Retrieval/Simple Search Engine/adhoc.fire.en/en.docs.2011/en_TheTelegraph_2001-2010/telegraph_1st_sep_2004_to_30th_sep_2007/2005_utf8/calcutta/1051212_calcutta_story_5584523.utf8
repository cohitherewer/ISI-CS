 Cops fall for boy?s kidnap account

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 A nine-year-old sent senior officers from two police stations in the city on a five-hour wild goose chase on Saturday after remaining missing overnight.

 Md Raj?s make-believe abduction tale prompted cops to set out in search of the house in Tangra where the boy said he had been kept confined. Soon enough, they found that Raj had taken them for a ride.

 When the cops later asked the boy why he had fabricated the story, his plain excuse was ?muh se nikal gaya (it just came out of my mouth)?.

 On Friday, Raj didn?t return home at 5B, Kashai Babu Lane after he stepped out to play around 11.30 am. After waiting till 5 pm, his parents lodged a missing person?s diary with Narkeldanga police station.

 ?With a string of disappearances ending in murders in the recent past, we didn?t want to take chances. We even tried to trace him beyond city limits,? said an officer.

 However, Raj returned home at around six on Saturday morning. He claimed that soon after he had stepped outdoors on Friday, a man, posing as a woman in a burkha, offered to take him to the workplace of his father, Rafiq Kureshi, in Tangra.

 Raj claimed that the man then locked him, with two other kids whose hands and legs were tied up, in room in a house near Pilkhana, in Tangra. The boy went on to describe how he had managed to escape when the kidnapper had gone out. He said he was running down the street when one of his father?s acquaintances spotted him and then put him on a bus home.

 Convinced by Raj?s account, Narkeldanga police immediately informed their counterparts in Tangra. For five hours, a team comprising officers from both police stations followed the directions given by the boy and went from house to house in Tangra and Entally trying to locate the place where he had allegedly been kept confined.

 ?Around 1.45 pm, we suspected that the boy was trying to pull a fast one on us. When we grilled him, he admitted that he had spent the night at the house of a friend?s acquaintance at 5C, Convent Lane,? said an officer who was in the search team.

 OC transfer pre-empted

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 At the hearing of a case of a missing schoolgirl, Calcutta High Court on Thursday directed North 24-Parganas superintendent of police Praveen Kumar and director-general of police S.C. Avasthy not to transfer the officer-in-charge of Titagarh police station without the leave of the court.

 Justice K.J. Sengupta passed the order after the officer-in-charge (OC) concerned prayed to the court to allow him two weeks? time to trace 15-year-old Mou Bhuina, who went missing on March 30 last year.

 The Class IX student, a resident of Chalkkahulia, was allegedly abducted by Sanjoy Das, of the same locality, while she was returning home from Barrackpore Talpukur Girls? High School.

 ?Sanjoy then sent her to Bangladesh. He is absconding ever since. Sanjoy?s parents were arrested but later released on bail,? Arabinda Roy, lawyer of Mou?s father Jivan Bhuina, informed the court.

 The lawyer said the missing girl?s parents received several telephone calls from Bangladesh, threatening them not to go to the police.

 ?A local political leader, Khokon Ganguly, and his associates are regularly harassing the Bhuinas over taking the matter to the police,? lawyer Roy told the court.

 On Thursday, the petitioner?s counsel told the court that some influential persons might get the OC transferred to another police station and interrupt in the investigation process.

 Justice Sengupta then asked the director-general and the district superintendent of police not to transfer the OC within 15 days. 

 He also said that the OC could seek help from the Criminal Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Criminal Investigation Department (CID) in the abduction case.

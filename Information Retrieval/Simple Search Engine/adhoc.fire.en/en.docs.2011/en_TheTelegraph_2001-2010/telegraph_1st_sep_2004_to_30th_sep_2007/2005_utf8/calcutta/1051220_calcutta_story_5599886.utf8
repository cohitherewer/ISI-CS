 2 acres too many 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 The decision by the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) not to grant affiliation to schools standing on plots smaller than two acres has hit prospective affiliates where it hurts.

 Authorities of several schools whose applications for affiliation were rejected on this ground alone have begun to approach the council for reconsideration.

 The authorities argue that it is ?almost impossible? to procure a plot larger than two acres in a congested city like Calcutta, even if they have enough funds. They want the two-acre clause abolished.

 ?We have been running our school (till Class VII) for the past few years. Hundreds of innocent students will suffer if we are denied affiliation because of the two-acre clause,? a principal wrote to the council after his application was turned down.

 In a bid to check mushrooming of schools with sub-standard infrastructure and poor management, the CISCE recently made the affiliation process stricter. As part of the quality control exercise, several applications have been rejected since July.

 The institutions that requested affiliation had all been granted provisional no-objection-certificates (NOCs) by the state government. The NOC is mandatory for seeking CISCE affiliation.

 Gillian Rosemary Hart, member of the executive committee of the CISCE, admitted that several schools had expressed dissatisfaction over the two-acre clause. The council was considering the suggestions of the aggrieved.

 ?The issue will be raised for discussion in the next meeting of the council. We hope to decide whether the two-acre clause should be abolished by April or not,? said Hart. But, she cautioned, even if the relaxation is granted, the schools seeking affiliation must ensure that they have ?adequate space?.

 The aggrieved schools have pointed out that more than a dozen institutions in Calcutta and Howrah, affiliated to the council, either operate from rented premises or stand on plots smaller than two acres.

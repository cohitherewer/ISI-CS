 Glassy radiance

 Showcasing masterpieces from the studio of Katayun Saklat, one of the few stained-glass artists of our country, Aura, the ongoing exhibition of stained glass works, offers absolute visual delight to lovers of modern art. On show is an amazing array of art objects, aesthetically designed and intricately crafted, that can serve as decorative articles or items of utility. While Saklat?s lamps are essentially decorative and artistic pieces, her panels are mostly inspired by religion. The largest among them depicts a dancing Ganesha and his mouse. Lord Buddha is captured in different moods, while Jewish, Zoroastrian and Sikh panels reflect a rare combination of beauty and spirituality. The sheer brilliance of the peacock with full moon panel is hard to miss. Besides, there are small, luminous gift items like fan-lights, sun-catchers, coasters, as well as miniature panels on stands adorned with figures of Ganesha and Mother Teresa.

 Event: An exhibition of stained glass works

 When: Till August 31, 2 pm - 7 pm (Sunday by appointment only)

 Where: Gallery Katayun, 4A Auckland Square

Behind the Bar

Going through Holi without downing a few glasses of 

thandai is like celebrating Christmas without the cake. While this traditional 

drink is still an integral part of the festival of colours, over the years there 

has been a lot of experimentation with the original recipe. And the drink has 

now evolved in various new avatars like Thandai Ice Cream, Thandai Gateau and 

Thandai Souffle.

According to Surinder Singh, executive chef of the 

Taj Bengal, ?No one makes thandai the traditional way any more. Nowadays 

people prefer to buy a bottle of ready-to-drink thandai and improvise on 

that.?

Singh recommends some fruity versions of the drink 

that are easy to whip up. For this you just have to mix fruit puree of your choice 

? be it mango, pineapple, orange or strawberry ? with a bottle of readymade thandai. 

Chef Sujit Sinha of Tangerine and Giridhar Dalmia 

of GG caterers offer some more authentic options from various parts of the country.

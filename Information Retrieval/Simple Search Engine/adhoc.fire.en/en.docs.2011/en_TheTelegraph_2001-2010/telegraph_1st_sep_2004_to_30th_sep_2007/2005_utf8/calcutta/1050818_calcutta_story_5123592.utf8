 Picture perfect plan: Walls for photographs

 If paintings can find pride of place on walls of drawing rooms, why should photographs be looked down on? That is the challenge with which National Academy of Photography (NAP) is going ahead with its plans to celebrate World Photography Day on Friday.

 ?If there is a blank space on the wall people think of hanging a painting; if there is a corner empty, a sculpture is placed there. Why should photograph be not considered as work of art, when it also comes cheaper?? contends NAP director Madhu Sarkar, himself an Excellence F?d?ration Internationale de l?art Photographique distinction-holder.

 The celebration of August 19, initiated by the French government in 1839, has been planned as a journey down photographic memory lane. ?At Gaganendra Pradarshashala, we will be showcasing pictures of old camera models, stating their year of manufacture, company and the system they ran on.? Thus information on the world?s first wooden detective camera from the 1860s will find place beside the latest Nikon D70. Some actual cameras will be on display as well, like the 1918 German Zeiss Ikcon.

 What are cameras without photographs? So another exhibition will have contributions from celebrated photographers like Sushanto Banerjee and wildlife specialist P.S. Lahiri. A simultaneous show will be held for students of the academy in front of Nandan II, to be inaugurated by filmmaker Sandip Ray.

 A seminar will be held as well with participation from various fields ? cinematography (Soumendu Roy), acting (Sabyasachi Chakraborty), painting (Shuvaprasanna) and photography (Benu Sen). ?The theme of the seminar is visualisation. A painter can see his picture, but the others cannot. The exchange will bring out how an actor executes his part in a whole he cannot see or how a cinematographer develops his vision from information culled from the director,? Sarkar explains.

 The Golf Club Road institute is honing shutterbugs with both professional aspirations and a creative bent. Rahul Biswas, a 22-year-old is balancing family business with the shooting floor. ?I just might pursue photography as a parallel profession. The career is on a high in the city now,? smiles the youth, busy preparing posters for the big day. 

 ?Once this perception can be broken among photographers about their work being no more than articles to be sent to exhibitions and then locked away, we can start building general awareness. Photography is a costly art. It has to generate self-employment to draw creative talent,? Sarkar states.

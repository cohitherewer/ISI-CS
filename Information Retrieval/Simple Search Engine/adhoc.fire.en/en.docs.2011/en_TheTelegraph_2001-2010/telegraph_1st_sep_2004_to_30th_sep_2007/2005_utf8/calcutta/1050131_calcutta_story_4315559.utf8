 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

From Rs 1,500 to Rs 7.5 lakh-plus, totalling Rs 13 crore. That?s how much 4,800 defaulters, out of 12,000 commercial consumers of water in the city, owe the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC). 

 Once more, the CMC is threatening to disconnect waterlines in an attempt to recover dues.

 On the list of the guilty are businesses, banks, the Metro Railway, Eastern Railway, the PWD office at Eden Gardens, the CAB, CMWSA, Collector of Customs, Food Corporation of India, CMRI and even Baranagar Municipality. 

 Mayor Subrata Mukherjee has directed municipal commissioner Debashis Som to snap supply to those who fail to pay up debts on the spot.

 ?Commercial houses running deep tubewells to meet their potable water requirements will also come under the drive. If they don?t pay up, we will seal their deep tubewells, too,? said Mukherjee.

 Of 1.3 lakh domestic connections, around 90,000 households with 10-mm and 15-mm ferrules are supplied water free. But to produce 230 million gallons of filtered water a day, the CMC spends Rs 30 crore a year on power alone.

 However, there are inconsistencies on the list, according to mayoral council member (water supply) Sovan Chatterjee. 

 ?A number of defaulters owe around Rs 2,000 each. There is another section that is paying up in instalments, so the threat of disconnection is not justified,? said Chatterjee.

 The CMC charges Rs 2,000 a month for commercial connections through 20-mm ferrules, and Rs 2,700 a month for 25-mm ferrules. Bulk, metered supply comes at Rs 10 per thousand litres.

 The water supply department has already collected Rs 1.68 crore from defaulters during a drive a few days ago, said chief engineer (water supply) Dibyendu Roychaudhury. 

 Supply has been disconnected at over a dozen premises, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 We Ask You Answer

 Book ?em, but let go lightly

 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Today?s question: Should book thieves at the Book Fair be punished like common thieves? More responses will be published next week

 Fair share: Visitors throng the mela grounds 

MD. Imran

 No, book thieves at the Book Fair cannot be treated like common thieves. They ruin the enjoyment and emotions associated with the Book Fair and should be imprisoned till the next year?s Fair so that they do not forget their misdeed, ever. 

Chandan Ray, 

 Sakuntala Park

 It won?t be fair to treat book thieves like common thieves. They deny many readers a chance to buy and read rare books and must be punished to the fullest extent. Because of the book thieves, certain books are lost forever to the world. 

Arpita Chowdhury, 

 Dum Dum

 Bookworms are not as harmful as other insects. Similarly, book thieves, too, are not as dangerous as other types of thieves. It is the love for books that compels one to steal them. Book thieves should not be punished harshly, at least, not in a country where corrupt politicians roam about freely.

Sananda Sanyal, 

 Baranagar

 Many of us are mesmerised by the huge collection of exotic books at the Book Fair. At times, some of us come across a book that we desperately want, but cannot afford, and fail to resist the temptation to steal. But the end, even if it is acquisition of knowledge, can never justify the means. So, book thieves must he punished strictly. 

Mohammed Zakaria, 

 Imdad Ali Lane

 Thieves are thieves, no matter what they steal, and do not deserve pardon. Not all book thieves steal for the love of books, and hence it would be dangerous to encourage them. In fact, book thieves, almost all of whom are aware that what they are doing is wrong, should be punished more harshly than ordinary thieves. 

Kajal Chatterjee,

 Sodepore

 Professional book thieves deserve the same punishment as common thieves. There are people who cannot afford to buy books, and steal to read them. They should not be bracketed with the common thieves. Sadly, there is no way to determine a book thief is a book lover or a professional. 

Ranadip Ganguly, 

 Diamond Park

 Stealing is an act of the uncivilised, while books are meant to propagate civilisation. So, stealing books from the Book Fair is an unpardonable act. Book thieves should be punished in the same manner as common thieves.

Debashis Pathak,

 Beleghata

 For a book thief at the Book Fair, Bengali Genteel?s Civic Code, and not the Indian Penal Code, is applicable. He should be asked to write down an essay of about three hundred words on ?Necessity of Stealing Books?. From this write-up, a panel of luminaries should judge whether the thief is a poor bibliophile or a kook or a mere kleptomaniac. If he is found to be a poor but a true book lover, he must be given away the stolen books.

Sourav Das,

 Kashi Ghosh Lane

 An emphatic yes. Are the book thieves in some way superior to other thieves? Certainly not. If they can?t purchase books, they should join a library, and not steal books. 

Huzefa Attarwala,

 Pollock Street

 Book thieves at the Book Fair should be punished like other thieves. None of the great books of the world encourage people to steal. So, no serious reader will ever be tempted to acquire books by stealing.

Dalim Kumar Datta,

 APC Bose Road

 Only people who cannot afford books steal them. And books aren?t of much use except in the enhancement of knowledge. So, book thieves should be treated sympathetically. But, in the larger interest, they should not be allowed to go scot-free. 

Diptimoy Ghosh, 

 Salt Lake

 No, not at all. A common thief would rather steal cash and valuables than books. Most of the people who steal books are book lovers and they do so because most books these days are exorbitantly priced. The basic intention is always to acquire knowledge and hence, they should not be punished stringently. 

Piyal Mukherjee,

 Lake Town

 The same law should apply inside the Book Fair as at other places. If book thieves are treated sympathetically, the book sellers would find it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to sustain themselves. All of us would then have to go without books.

Anirban Sur,

 Sinthee

 Those who visit the Book Fair are supposed to be book lovers and intellectuals. They are certainly not petty criminals, and should not be treated as one. Instead, the organisers should come with some intellectual punishment. For example, book thieves may be asked to recite poetry or answer questions on a subject they are interested in. 

D.P. Bhattacharyya,

 Sonarpur

 Stealing is always illegal. But I do not think book thieves at the Book Fair should be punished like common thieves. They should be let off with warnings. Many of us borrow books without the intention of returning them. Isn?t that also stealing?

Soumya Das, 

 Bangur Avenue

 Stealing cannot be justified in any way, be it the stealing of valuables or books. But if a person steals books, a thorough check of the person?s character, financial status and related circumstances has to be made before a punishment is meted out. A person in serious need of a book, without having the capacity of buying it, may be driven to stealing the book. A lenient decision has to be made in such a case. 

Parimal Vyas, 

 Howrah

 Book thieves are a class apart. They cannot be treated like common thieves. The reason they steal are, quite often, not simple. Novel methods should be applied to find out their motive before one decides on a punishment. 

Srila Ghosh, 

 Golf Green

 Most people who buy books at the Book Fair do not have the time or inclination to read them. The tomes become showpieces in their drawing rooms. In such a scenario, if ?thieves? are caught stealing books at the Book Fair, they should be presented with the books. It would be a disgrace if they are punished like common thieves. 

Boddhayan Bhowmick, 

 Bagha Jatin

 Never. Because there are people in the city who do not even know the names of the books in their bookshelves. A better idea would be to make the book thieves do some work for the publisher in exchange of the books. 

Joydeep Chatterjee, 

 Shyambazar

 Of course. Theft is theft, whether it is at the Book Fair or in a house. Books are knowledge and should be treated as God. No nuisance should be tolerated at the Book Fair. 

Sankar Lal Singh, 

 RL Street

It is difficult to answer the question in one word. 

There are bookworms who take advantage of the crowd at the Book Fair to steal 

books. In such cases, one should consider the thief?s real need of the book before 

punishing him or her. But no mercy should be shown to people who steal books only 

to resell them. 

Indranil sanyal, 

Dhakuria

No, the book thieves must not be treated like ordinary 

thieves. They should not be put behind bars, but punished in such a way that they 

do not attempt to steal books again. 

Tapan Pal, 

 Batanagar

 Definitely. Middle-class Bengalis have a lot of idiosyncrasies about books. Encouraging book hawkers to encroach footpaths on College Street, while supporting Operation Sunshine to evict hawkers of other wares is a classic example of their double standard when it comes to books. Book selling is no different from selling wine or condom. The people engaged in it are there primarily for making a livelihood, so in their interest at least book thieves should not be encouraged.

 Of sexual pests and policies

 MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA

 Sexual harassment is likely to occur at every workplace at some point, and companies must be equipped with a policy to deal with it. That was the message sent out at a sensitisation session at the Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) Salt Lake office on Tuesday.

 TCS, which follows the Tata code of conduct that addresses sexual harassment, decided to take its policy to the people. Guidelines are useless if employees are not aware of them. So, to mark International Women?s Day, US consul-general George N. Sibley and Sanhita, an NGO, were called in to pass on vital information.

 Sibley said that he is in favour of discrimination in the workplace ? but only if the basis is correct and just. 

 While performance is a valid reason for one employee to be treated differently from another, race, colour, religion, sex and national origin are not. He also stressed that both men and women could be victims of unwelcome sexual advances or a hostile work environment.

 ?The consul-general also spoke about the US law, which was apt for our employees, as we do so much work in the US,? said Ajoyendra Mukherjee, TCS vice-president. 

 The afternoon session at the packed Saltlec canteen was a first-of-its-kind effort organised by Maitree, an association of employee spouses, which puts together events for the well-being of the TCS community.

 ?When I joined in 1980, we had no policy of this kind,? Mukherjee added. The company is clearly receptive to the fact that such problems may arise. ?I am not aware of any sexual harassment complaints coming up here, but that doesn?t mean it doesn?t occur,? he stressed.

 This echoed the sentiment of Sanhita?s training film, screened as part of the event. In the video, actress Churni Ganguly makes the point that all workplaces have sexual harassment, though it may not be reported. As no organisation can guarantee harassment will never occur, even if it has no history of such discrimination, guidelines must be in place.

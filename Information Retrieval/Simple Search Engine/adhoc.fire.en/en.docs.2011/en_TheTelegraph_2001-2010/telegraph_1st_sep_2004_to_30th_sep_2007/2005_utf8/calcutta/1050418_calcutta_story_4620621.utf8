Ogaan: design destination

IPSITA DEB

Ogaan ? a venture by Delhi-based stylist Kavita Bhartia ? is a designer destination housing creations by some of the best-known names in the country?s fashion circuit, as well as a platform for young creative talent.

 Housed in the residential Lake Road area, the colonial-looking studio, with pillared portals and gilded iron grills, was designed by architect Revati Kamath almost a decade ago.

 The first outlet of Ogaan was opened in Hauz Khas Village, Delhi, in 1989 to ?create a storehouse of versatile clothing ? from traditional Indian to hip westerns, along with a dash of fusion?. 

Haute heritage

 The range of ethnic designs offered here swings from evening grandeur to campus casual. Bhartia?s own creations blend traditional techniques with an international appeal. Stylised silhouettes with embroidery and embellishments can be found in silk, brocade, cotton, georgette and crepe. 

 Renu Tandon?s label Mynah, Ritika Bhasin and Aparna Chandra?s range of heavily-embroidered and printed saris and salwar suits with mirror and stone work are the other highlights. Calcutta-based labels like Stae, Couturewalla and Ashish Pandey also share rack space.

Mix and match

 Corsets, spaghetti straps, sleeveless embroidered tops and ponchos in a variety of hues and designs make the western wear selection highly wearable and trendy. A range of ankle-length, ghagroo-style skirts steal the show. 

 Bhartia?s label Omana throws up a line of interesting skirts, where the ace designer mixes traditional printing techniques with modern cuts and fabrics. These can be teamed with simple yet elegant fitted tops by Wild Orchid.

Gem glam

 A collection of jewellery by Amrapali and Mumbai-based label Dagma complements the garments at the studio. While Amrapali offers pieces in silver with semi-precious stones, Dagma deals with a new concept of leather jewellery.

Trendy totes

 The one-stop fashion shop offers a host of bags for every occasion and age group. Labels Malaga, J2 and Omana flaunt a versatile range of evening bags. While Malaga uses brocade, zardosi, floral prints and mismatched fabrics, Omana follows the more simplistic route with subtle prints and textured fabrics. J2, on the other hand, has come up with a creative bunch of mobile bags with sequins adorning simple crochet work.

Tea time

 Ogaan, in both Calcutta and Delhi, has a corner called the Sacred Grove that offers a host of items ranging from natural products to savouries. Indian floral fragrances packaged in glass containers crafted by artisans, aroma therapy kits and pot pourris from the Himalayas serve up good gift items. There?s also an aromatic tea corner, where tea-lovers can actually sip the beverage before buying it.

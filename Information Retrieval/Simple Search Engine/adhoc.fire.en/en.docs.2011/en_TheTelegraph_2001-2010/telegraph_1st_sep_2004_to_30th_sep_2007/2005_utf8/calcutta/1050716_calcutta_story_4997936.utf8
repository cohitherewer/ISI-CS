 Pain and pathos of Partition

 A moment from Rangakarmee?s Sarhad Paar Manto

 The trauma of Partition 58 years ago gives birth to two productions running locally, one in Hindi and the other in Bengali.

 While Rangakarmee has gone on a German tour showcasing its older Kashinama, we hope that they also present Sarhad Paar Manto there, not only because of its author and its power but also because the shorter duration of its two playlets makes it easier to transcend the language barrier. 

 This second part of Rangakarmee?s tripartite homage to Manto 50 years after his death improves markedly on its predecessor Badnam Manto. But that should come as no surprise, as it contains two of Manto?s classic stories ? Khol Do and Toba Tek Singh.

 In the former, an Indian Muslim father and daughter experience sheer horror as they cross over to a refugee camp in nascent Pakistan; it is best not to reveal the outcome to those who do not know the story. 

 Toba Tek Singh is the ironist?s masterpiece, about the insanity of deporting madmen from both sides according to their faith ? a Sikh lunatic in Pakistan refuses to go to India, himself finally symbolising no-man?s-land between the nations, or an undivided India, depending on which way we look at it, and a lot like Manto?s own life. 

 Usha Ganguly has scripted and directed tautly, as she normally does, according to her strength. The collective scenes of refugees come across forcefully. But she continues to place herself in the superfluous role of narrator, undermining the impact ? the dramatisations speak for themselves and need neither explanation nor prose interludes excerpted from Manto.

 The helplessness of the father (Chhabilal Ram Sonkar) and the brutalised daughter (Sanhita Dutta) in Khol Do, and the discombobulated, brooding protagonist (Narendra Roy) and distinctly individualised portraits of other ?loonies? in Toba Tek Singh stay in our memory. Khaled Chowdhury?s centrepiece of barbed wire sets the atmosphere.

 Arghya?s latest production, Kalsrot, attempts to reconstruct the history of communal conflicts in India by pointing all fingers at Partition as the root cause. This is short-sighted oversimplification, of course, that astute audiences may find difficult to accept. Automatically the British also become easy scapegoats, which sidesteps the deeper nature of the problem. 

 The lack of a proper script ? director Manish Mitra?s idea has developed through workshops ? compounds the shortcomings. As usual with Mitra, he visualises some frighteningly harrowing scenes, but in the end Kalsrot remains a didactic piece, and rather weak at that.

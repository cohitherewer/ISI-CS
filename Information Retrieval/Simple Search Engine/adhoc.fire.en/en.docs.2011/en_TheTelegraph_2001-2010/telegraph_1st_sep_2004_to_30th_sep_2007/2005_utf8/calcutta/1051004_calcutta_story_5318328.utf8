The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 High-five festival

 Van Helsing, HBO?s Diwali blockbuster, to be beamed on October 25 at 9 pm

 Home Box Office (better known as HBO) is turning five in India and it?s time to reaffirm ties with the audience. It?s also cause for celebrations, especially as it has been crowned ?the number one English movie channel?.

 Calcutta ranks third in viewership among the six metros, says Shruti Bajpai, country manager of HBO. ?The city accounts for 16 per cent of our viewership.?

 More than the volume, it is the quality that has caught the channel?s attention. ?Our surveys have always found the city to be eclectic in terms of its movie-viewing choices,? says Shruti of Satyajit Ray?s hometown.

 HBO prides itself on its library, enriched by the banks of four top-grade studios ? Sony, Warner, Universal and Paramount. ?That is how we can bring current blockbusters like Men in Black II and the Lord of the Rings troika first to your doorstep,? she explains.

 Another secret of success has been to weave the movies with a thematic thread. ?We choose an event ? say, the Oscars in February, or the International Women?s Day in March, or action marathon during the summer vacations ? based on which the movies are chosen. This way, the channel becomes more than a loose bunch of movies.? Recently, The Matrix movies were successively screened under the rubric ?The world of tomorrow.? 

 The third ace: the HBO originals. ?These are productions made by HBO for HBO.? The issues may range from the serious (AIDS) to the salacious (Sex and the City). The mini-series Band of Brothers (the costliest of its kind) by Stephen Spielberg and Tom Hanks was another winner.

 These three key factors have helped the channel bloom as a brand, feels Shruti.

 Though it is known to be the face of Hollywood here, in its country of origin, the US, movies account for barely 15 per cent of the channel platter, leaving the rest to the HBO originals. ?Here we do not want to dilute our profile. We started with one series every month. Now, we have gone up to five. But the 80:20 ratio will not be reversed.?

 India was among HBO?s last stops in Asia, where the channel set foot more than 12 years ago. ?But it is in the top three in the continent now in terms of importance,? says Shruti.

 As for the celebration party, it?ll all be on the small screen. Brace for an ?explosion? of both box-office hits and off-beat offerings. 

 After all, the programme list for October comes in the shape of a fire extinguisher .

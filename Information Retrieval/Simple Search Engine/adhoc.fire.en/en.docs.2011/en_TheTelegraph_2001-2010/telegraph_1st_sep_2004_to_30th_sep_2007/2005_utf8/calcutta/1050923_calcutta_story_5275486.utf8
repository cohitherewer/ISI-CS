The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The new Mrs B

 Revathy with Karan Sharma in Dil Jo Bhi Kahey

 After Hema Malini (Baghban), Jaya Bachchan (Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham) and Sharmila Tagore (Viruddh), it?s now the turn of Revathy to be Mrs Amitabh Bachchan on the big screen. This Friday?s Bollywood release, Dil Jo Bhi Kahey, has the actor-director from down south playing wife to the Big B. But she isn?t ready to be rated yet. ?The audience will have to tell that after watching the film,? she tells Metro.

 The Romesh Sharma film wasn?t the first time that the two met. ?I had met Amitji a couple of times before, because of Abhishek?s presence in Phir Milenge. But I never expected to work with him. He called me up one day and told me about this film. And when Romesh narrated the story I was more than happy to play his wife,? Revathy recalls.

 Salman Khan?s heroine in Love and now better known as the National Award-winning director of Mitr ? My Friend, Revathy admitted learning a lot from Bachchan. ?The kind of positive energy he has, it?s just amazing to see. The way he has bounced back after so much of criticism is worth appreciating. Previously, I used to get upset over very small things but after watching him work, I have changed.?

 Also important is Revathy?s role as Karan Sharma?s mother. ?My character is very orthodox. It?s a story of the conflict between an Indian and a European family in Mauritius. It?s also about the relationship between a husband and his wife and between a son and his parents.? 

 Acting is something which the acclaimed director now does by choice. ?I am still very much open to acting but after 25 years in films, I can?t work just for the sake of working. I should enjoy what I am doing. I am an obedient actor too. When I am acting, I?m just acting. Every director has his own vision. The way I see a script and the way someone else will see the same script can be different. So it?s always better to do what the director wants.?

 The two-month-old agitation cloud over the Jadavpur University campus has failed to make any impact on the demand for seats in the engineering and technology faculty. The demand, in fact, is highest among students who figure on the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) merit list.

 Officials said of the 800 undergraduate seats in the 17 departments under the faculty, counselling for which kicked off on June 22, only 64 remained vacant till Friday afternoon.

 And of these vacant seats ? 47 in the pharmacology technology department and 17 in the printing technology department ? most were filled up by Sunday.

 The students who have bagged the seats are among the first 1,000 on the merit list.

 Another government-run engineering institute where the demand for seats has remained high is Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur.

 ?Seats in almost all the departments on Jadavpur and Shibpur campuses have been bagged by candidates who have ranked within 1,250 on the merit list,? said Ajit Chattopdhyay, convener of the central selection committee of the JEE board. 

 Officials said the private engineering colleges where students among the first 1,500 on the merit list have sought seats included the Institute of Engineering and Management, Heritage Institute of Technology and BP Poddar Institute of Engineering and the Future Institute of Engineering and Technology ? all located in Calcutta.

 The central selection committee, however, has noticed a disturbing trend this year. Around 25 per cent of the students among the first 1,500 have not turned up for counselling.

 Officials said the students might have also qualified for the medical course or any of the ?better-category engineering institutes?, like the IITs. 

 ?There could also be a third reason. Some of them may have shifted to another state for a bachelor?s degree in engineering,? said an official.

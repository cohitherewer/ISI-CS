 She who has the hot bod

 Which actress has the best body in Bollywood? This Best of 2005 Film Poll category was almost too close to call, but finally local favourite Bipasha Basu pipped the rest to the popularity post

 1. She may go de-glam in her cotton saris in Apaharan but don rsquo;t we all know what suits BIPASHA BASU best? The 28.2 per cent votes ensured that Bips won the Best Body honours a day after beau John Abraham was crowned Mr Body. ldquo;Thank you, rdquo; smiled the girl from Gariahat, looking forward to the sequels Dhoom 2 and Phir Hera Pheri

 2. Her nine-minute Myth was busted but by then MALLIKA SHERAWAT had travelled to every festival as Chan rsquo;s underclad chameli. Here, with 21.2 per cent votes she just lost out to the Bengali bombshell 

 3. With 19.1 per cent votes AISHWARYA RAI is a somewhat surprise third above more fancied bods. Guess, with her blazing in a bikini in Dhoom 2, next year she may be right up there with Bips

 4. When she launched that flying kick in those tight jeans in the early reels of Dus, jaws just kept hanging. But SHILPA SHETTY must be hurt to learn that she rsquo;s only managed a fourth spot in the body brigade

 5. Abhishek rsquo;s Piggy Chops, PRIYANKA CHOPRA has never shied away from shedding her clothes. Miss Bluffmaster! though has managed only a fifth place in our poll. But with films like Krrish slated for 2006, the former Miss World should climb the hot bod ranks

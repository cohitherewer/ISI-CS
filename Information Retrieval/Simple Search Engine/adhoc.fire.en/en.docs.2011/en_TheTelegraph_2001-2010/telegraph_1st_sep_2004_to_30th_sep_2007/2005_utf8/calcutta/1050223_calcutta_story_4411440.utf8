 History amp; simulated reality

 - Film reconstructs attack on Hitler, parallel world events

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A moment from Discovery?s The Secret Plot to Kill Hitler

 How would it feel to be a fly on the wall back in time in decisive moments of history? Discovery Channel has chosen a day 60 years back to find out how.

 July 20, 1944. A day in the thick of World War II. A day when Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg detonated two lb of explosives at the foot of his supreme commander Adolf Hitler. The Fuhrer survived and the war continued on its course.

 The incident, a footnote in people?s memory, has been reconstructed, hour by hour, on camera that ?also takes a 360-degree look at what else was happening in Europe and the US at the same time?, in the words of Raja Balasubramanian, brand director, Discovery Networks. The Discovery team was in Calcutta on Tuesday for the screening of an edited version of Virtual History. The show will beam on the channel in two parts ? the Making of Virtual History on March 12 at 9 pm and The Secret Plot to Kill Hitler on March 13 at 8 pm.

 Thus, as Hitler approaches the attack on his life at a briefing with his generals, Marshal Josef Stalin plans an attack on Poland, Prime Minister Winston Churchill considers use of poison gas on German civilians and President Roosevelt suffers a heart attack on a train.

 What makes Virtual History spectacular is the fact that it is the product of painstaking research shaped by technology. 

 The channel and Tiger Aspect Productions spent three years consulting experts and archives. Actors were chosen on the basis of distances between their cheeks, noses and eyes, so that they corresponded with those of the historical personages. Each scene was shot thrice ? without characters (just the background), with characters and then with masks on the faces of the characters to track their face movements. These were to act as templates for the computer animated masks that had been prepared, based on moulds of the historical faces. The team even produced over 950 still photographs, of which 41 were used.

 The product is often uncannily close to the documentary feel of footage. ?As long as we are historically accurate, it (reconstructing) is not a bad thing,? claims director David Mcnab. 

 But as historian Barun Dey pointed out at the screening, history is always a version and what Virtual History shows is the ?West German version?. The dangers of simulating reality in the audio-visual media were hinted at by Prof Surendar Chawdhary of Film and Television Institute of India, Pune. He added how films in India now invest in fantasies. ?Both films and history can tell truths and lies.? When will our histories be told on screen in such fantastic detail?

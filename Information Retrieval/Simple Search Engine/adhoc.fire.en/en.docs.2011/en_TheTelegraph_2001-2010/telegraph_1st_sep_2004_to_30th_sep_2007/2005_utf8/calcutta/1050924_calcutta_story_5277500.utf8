The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Axe-tree pleas swell

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Last month, two trees in the compound of a reputable school in south Calcutta were felled. A little girl who studies there told her parents about it and persuaded them to alert the state forest department. 

 A club on the Maidan cut down a tree before the authorities could give permission. The club officers have been warned against cutting trees in future without clearance.

 Suddenly, Calcutta seems to be up in arms against its green cover. The tree-cutting committee, with representatives from forest department and state Pollution Control Board (PCB), is being swamped with petitions to axe them. 

 Requests are coming from unusual quarters like schools, clubs and groups of residents of a locality ? apart from those made by realtors and construction companies. 

 On an annual average, the committee is receiving applications for cutting 2,000 trees in and around the city. In the past two months, about 500 applications have been received.

 A public state insurance company wants to fell 37 trees to construct its office in a prime location, officials said.

 ?With no proper monitoring, the city faces a threat of losing all its greenery one day,? a PCB official said. 

 Faced with this slew of applications, the forest department has set up a monitoring committee in the Calcutta area, whose job will be to find out how many saplings are actually planted by those given permission to fell trees on compelling grounds. 

 ?There was no system of finding out whether those felling trees are abiding by the Calcutta High Court directive to plant five saplings against every tree cut,? said Prabhas Ranjan Chakraborty, divisional forest officer (forest utilisation division). ?The committee will find whether those given permission in the past five years actually planted saplings.?

 Recently, an appeal by Eastern Railway to cut down 18 trees near the construction site of Chitpur railway terminal was turned down by the committee. But railway officers said they would put in a fresh application. 

 ?The trees are blocking the approach road to the terminal and the roots may damage the road. But we will definitely take up required afforestation elsewhere,? said an officer.

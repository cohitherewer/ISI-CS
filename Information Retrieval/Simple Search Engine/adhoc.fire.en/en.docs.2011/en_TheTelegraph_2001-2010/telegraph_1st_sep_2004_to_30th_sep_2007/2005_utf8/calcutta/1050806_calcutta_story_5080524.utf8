 Strike stalls varsity

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Classes were disrupted at the Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur, on Friday, following a strike call by the students? union. 

 The call for a strike came in the wake of a recent clash between two groups of students on the campus on July 20. The union supporters stayed away from classes, demanding punishment of the culprits involved in July 20 clashes.

 N.R.Banerjee, vice-chancellor of the university, said an inquiry committee has been set up to probe the incident. The report will be placed before the university?s board of governors on August 26. 

 After the findings are examined by the board of governors, the university will decide what action should be taken against the students who had created trouble on July 20 .

 But a section of students has demanded that the university take action immediately. They called the strike when their demand was not conceded to, the vice-chancellor said.

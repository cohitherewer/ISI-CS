The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Prize for a cause

 - Winners put booty to use for community

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Kalighat Milan Sangha idol in 2004

 It is not enough to do a job well but one must also keep the good work going. That is the impetus that is driving the winning committees which were feted as CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja in 2004.

 ?The contest has changed our attitude and brought us alive to our social commitment,? smiles Samir Banerjee of Kalighat Milan Sangha. The puja, which got five coveted stars in 2004, has put the prize money of Rs 25,000 to good use. ?We have started a coaching centre for underprivileged students in our locality.? The area has a population of artisans and sex workers. ?Some of their children do not even go to school. We have bought them books and pencils.? The club has a hall in which the classes are taking place.

 The ?Model? Manicktalla Chaltabagan Lohapatty Durgapuja had planned to open a clinic for the free check-up of para people round the year but responded to a cry for help from afar. ?When the tsunami devastation took place, we could think of no better way than to give it all back to those who have lost everything,? says Ashok Jaiswal. So they raised Rs 50,000 to add to the Rs 50,000 prize money and handed over Rs 1 lakh to the ABP Tsunami fund. That does not mean that social work in the Burrabazar hub of iron and steel traders has come to a halt. Donations have reached a needy girl for her bypass surgery, and books and clothes have been distributed among children and residents respectively. Similar donations are reaching other organisations regularly. ?We want to continue with such activities which have acquired so much meaning to us now,? says Jaiswal.

 Shibmandir, another Five-Star puja, had bought a computer for Shibmandir Shiksha Niketan, the school for the underprivileged that they run, with their booty as the ?Model Puja? for 2003. The 2004 prize money went in various activities at the school, a picnic, Independence Day programme, etc. The kids also got new clothes for Puja.

 This time the puja has taken long strides in safety precautions. ?It is not enough for us to attend a fire safety camp,? reasons general secretary Partho Ghosh. So the club has handed over charge to an industrial fire-fighting agency. ?An electrical engineer has done our wiring,? he adds. Will they be back on top on the clean, green and humane puja list? ?We are certainly in the fight,? Ghosh smiles. A fight where every soldier is a crusader for a cause.

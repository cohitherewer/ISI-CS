 Fizzle more than sizzle

 Bharat Dabholkar?s shows are cannon fodder for critics. I have had some of the greatest fun in my career ? no, not by watching them, but by writing about them. Progressively, as the Bottoms Up series bottomed out, my reviews of them got more entertaining, I was told. That may not be a compliment, of course, given the abysmal depths that it plumbed. What gave me greater pleasure, however, is finding that audiences too began to reject The Return of the Grandson of Bottoms Up or such similarly-titled rancid sequels. 

 But does Dabholkar realise that the public found them nowhere nearly as delicious as his Amul ads? Well, yes and no. The latest edition (presented by Sanskriti Sagar at GD Birla Sabhagar, August 6-7) is cleverly disguised as Tamasha Mumbai Ishtyle! suggesting that he wants to play down the links with Bottoms Up. 

 He actually tries to give it a narrative thread, instead of the stringy revue form used so far. Above all, we must hand it to him for indirectly and humorously apologising in several lines about the poor quality of Bottoms Up. 

 At least he registers the criticism, it seems, unlike Dinyar Contractor who carries on his peccadilloes regardless. On the other hand, he still subtitles this production as ?Bottoms Up Goes Folksy!?. Obviously, if mistakenly, he feels proud of his brand. 

 Notwithstanding the attempt to provide a storyline, it remains thin, about a Maharani who cannot conceive an heir to the throne and her Maharaja who cannot conceive why, until he ends up conceiving a baby himself, thanks to mixed-up mantras. Ultimately, Dabholkar falls back on the same adolescent sexual punning and tasteless situations that have made his name mud in theatre circles. 

 The debts to the vibrant Marathi folk tamasha are truly flimsy. Occasionally, when Dabholkar satirises politics or social customs, the inheritance becomes evident and we feel that something just might happen. For example, when the Minister and Kotwal start squabbling, the Maharaja tells them to behave in parliamentary fashion. Immediately, they turn more unruly, tossing things at each other, and the Maharaja has to intervene, saying: ?When I said parliamentary, I didn?t mean Indian parliament.? 

 There is also a snide send-up of Dinyar Contractor, although a bit like the kettle calling the pot black. But such sparks fly few and far between. Several jokes are stale, while the cast members, comprising Dabholkar?s deadpan vets, have their acts down so pat that they cease to be funny. A revealing index of the gender bias is that he gives only one actress (the Maharani) enough lines to deliver; the other women are just ornamental walk-ons. 

 The singing and dancing fizzle rather than sizzle. Why cannot Dabholkar understand that nobody in their right minds wants to see half a dozen insipid amateurs trot out half-baked ?titillating? choreography when Bollywood specialises in such ?hot? item numbers? As for the music, what can one say when all the songs are canned, the cast merely mouthing the words? A recipe for cheesecake that flops.

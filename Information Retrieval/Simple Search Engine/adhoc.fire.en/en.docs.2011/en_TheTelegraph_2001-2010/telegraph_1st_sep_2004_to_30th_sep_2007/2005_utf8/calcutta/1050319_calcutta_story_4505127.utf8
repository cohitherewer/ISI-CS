The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 East-West dream derailed by Delhi

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s dream project, the East-West Metro, has run into a roadblock. The Bhattacharjee government has recently learnt that the Centre has made allocations under the National Urban Renewal Mission for a Metro corridor in Mumbai and Bangalore.

 So, Calcutta will now have to stand in queue, with Hyderabad and Pune, for similar allocations under the Mission, at least till 2006, for the East-West Metro to go on track.

 ?I am leaving for Delhi on Saturday for a meeting with the Prime Minister on the East-West Metro and a few other transport projects, among other things,? Bhattacharjee told Metro in the lobby of the Assembly on Friday. ?I shall try to impress upon the Centre that such projects are crucial not only to Bengal but also to the eastern region,? he added.

 Early this month, Bhattacharjee learnt about the allocations for Mumbai and Bangalore and called up finance minister P. Chidambaram to express his unhappiness.

 ?Is it fair to deprive Calcutta in this manner? Your government has been talking about looking towards the East, towards Calcutta, the gateway to the East. Yet, in reality, you are ignoring Calcutta,? he is said to have told Chidambaram.

 Senior officials from Delhi then informed the state that Mumbai and Bangalore had been chosen for the Metro project, as Calcutta already had the system in place.

 Officials in the state secretariat, however, felt the main reason for Calcutta?s East-West Metro dream crumbling was the government?s failure to submit the full project report before the Planning Commission and its reluctance to bear a partial burden of the project cost.

 The Maharashtra and Karnataka governments have not only got their project reports cleared, they have also pledged funds to the tune of Rs 1,000 crore to 1,500 crore.

 The Bengal government engaged Delhi Metro Railway Corporation (DMRC) in May 2004 to prepare the project report. ?When we were on the verge of finalising the report, we were asked by the chief secretary, on January 6, to revise the project reducing the route length (to cut costs). Also, we sought data from the transport department that we are yet to receive,?? alleged DMRC chief consultant Ashok Sengupta.

 Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty put up a brave front: ?I do not think the delay in submitting the project report was the reason and we hope the Centre will approve the light rail transit (LRT) project.?? The Rs 2,500-crore LRT project is what transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury is now camping in Delhi to try and get cleared.

 Celebrating seniority

 Science of Star 

 Wars: Tech talk

 Bollywood has truly come of age 

 and Viruddh, AB Corp?s return vehicle, is a step 

 in that direction. Exploring the life of a senior couple 

 as the two take a trip down memory lane, the bilingual film 

 by Mahesh Manjrekar features the coming together of Amitabh 

 Bachchan and Sharmila Tagore after more than two decades.

 To make the film and the cause 

 even more special, STAR Plus has tied up with the film to 

 run a unique contest named Viruddh ? Talaash ek adarsh 

 jodi kii? ?targeted at senior citizens who have faced 

 many a battle in life with grace and courage?. 

 The contest invites ordinary couples 

 in their 60s, married for at least 25 years, to come up 

 with their own heart-warming stories of courage and determination 

 faced together from the early years to the autumn of their 

 lives. 

 To take part in the 15-day contest, 

 which kicked off on June 15, viewers need to send in their 

 stories in not less than 500 words to Viruddh Adarsh Jodi 

 Contest, 002, Sunshine Apartments, Mahada Building No. 4, 

 Andheri (W), Mumbai ? 53. The last date is June 29 with 

 the forms available on indya.com. 

 The jury, consisting of the cast 

 of Bachchan, Tagore and John Abraham, will select five couples 

 who will be announced in a special episode, anchored by 

 Bachchan, on July 9. The viewers will be asked to vote for 

 the adarsh jodi, who will be flown to Mumbai to attend 

 the grand premiere of Viruddh.

 When the first Star Wars 

 hit movie halls in 1977, the world had not seen a motion 

 picture quite like it ? space stations, intelligent robots, 

 light sabers, hovercrafts? In the 30 years since, the film 

 has infiltrated real life. With the release of George Lucas?s 

 epic Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, Discovery 

 Channel presents a three-part series on the Star War 

 legacy. 

 Each hour of Science of Star 

 Wars, June 17-19, 10 pm, hosted by droids C3PO and R2D2, 

 features stories and interviews of people inspired and helped 

 by Star Wars technology and philosophies made real 

 ? innovations changing the way we live. Artificial intelligence, 

 transportation, military technology ? it reveals 

 the impact of one of cinema?s most successful sci-fi classics. 

 Man and Machines, the first 

 episode, showcases robots increasingly taking the place 

 of human hands or pets. Episode 2, Space Cowboys, 

 is about developments in transportation technology and how 

 they mirror travel tools in Star Wars.

 Until recently, only governments 

 had the ability to send crafts into space. But this year, 

 private companies and individuals have entered the fray. 

 The Spacex company will soon launch the first private rocket, 

 The Falcon. 

 Count Dooku?s Geonosis 

 solar sailor from Episode II: Attack of the Clones operates 

 the same way as NASA?s highest-flying aircraft, Helos 

 ? solar power. Personal airborne vehicles of the future 

 are almost ready. The M-400 Skycar designed by Moller International 

 is reminiscent of pod racers from the saga.

 The final episode is War, Weaponry 

 and the Force. The army of the future will have hi-tech 

 uniforms and communications systems, and will be helped 

 by robots and laser weapons like in the force. 

 The CL-327 device is like the 

 spy droids in Star Wars, almost identical to those 

 on Hoth in Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back. The 

 earth?s version of the Jedi knight is the Shaolin monk. 

 The first generation of robots 

 has landed on Earth?s battlefield. The Gladiator is an armed, 

 unmanned vehicle, an excellent marksman. The Cooperative 

 Unmanned Ground Attack Robot will be on future battlefields. 

 Who says the Star Wars 

 world lives only on the screen?

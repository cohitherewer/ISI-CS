The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 We Ask You Answer

 Entry curbs for unruly campus

 Each week, Metro asks readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses is published every Wednesday. Today?s question: Can law and order problems on the campus be solved by banning entry of outsiders to colleges? More letters will be published next week 

 United in protest: A gathering at the gate of Calcutta University, College Street campus

 Sukumar ghosh,

 Mukundapur

 A curb on attire of girl students would improve the law and order situation on the campuses more than the banning of outsiders. A dress code has been imposed on female students of Mumbai University. Other colleges and universities in the country should follow suit. Skimpy clothes worn by the girl students lead to cases of molestation.

 How can the law and order problems on campuses be solved by banning entry of outsiders? Students? unions are the sources of almost all such problems. Political parties must maintain the sanctity of the educational institutions.

 Sudipa Dutta Chowdhury, 

 Dum Dum Park

 A ban on the entry of outsiders to colleges is not practicable. It would not be possible to maintain vigil on all the entry points throughout the day or shut the gates. Besides, too many restrictions would rob the fun of college life for students. The only solution is awareness. Students should alert authorities if anyone is found moving around suspiciously on campus. The student unions, too, should device methods to eradicate the problem.

 Sourish Misra, 

 Salt Lake

 The recent unfortunate incidents in various colleges have all been perpetrated by outsiders. Yet, there is almost no restriction on entry of outsiders in most colleges. Anyone can enter the premises at any time and roam about freely. A ban is an option worth considering.

 Udayan Banerjee, 

 SN Mukherjee Lane

 Outsiders often cause law and order problems on campus, but a ban won?t make everything hunky-dory. Authorities should not ignore the fact that most outsiders are encouraged to enter the premises by the students and staff. A system of punishment should be started to discourage this habit. Even ex-students of the college should be treated as outsiders and should be allowed to enter only if they have a valid reason.

 Arunava Bose Chowdhury,

 Barrackpore 

 A couple of sporadic incidents do not indicate that there is a law and order problem in colleges and their boundaries need to be fortified. If restrictions are imposed on outsiders, those visiting the institutions for matters indirectly related to academics would be deprived. The students should not invite friends to their colleges. They should also restrict non-academic activities on campus to the common room. Any outsider found misbehaving on campus should be punished.

 A.F. Kamruddin Ahmed, 

 Bandpur, Hooghly

 When I took admission to a college in Sealdah in 1967, the so-called dadas of the locality used to dictate terms on the campus. A student who protested against them got beaten up. Today, when I visit my daughter?s college in north Calcutta, I feel the situation has remained much the same. Even in girls? colleges, local goons share power with the principal and the management. Members of students? unions openly bring in supporters from outside. It won?t be easy to ban their entry. If a ban is indeed implemented, the law and order problems in colleges will vanish. The ruling parties can improve the situation considerably if they want to.

 Campuses should always be open to guardians. It would be a shame if parents are denied access in the name of security. A better idea would be to screen outsiders before their entry.

 Kajal Chatterjee,

 Sodepur

 All the recent incidents in colleges were the handiwork of outsiders, who have a field day on unprotected campuses. It is quite unbelievable how hoodlums of Burrabazar, Kalabagan and Muchipara venture into the Presidency campus. Strict vigil can improve the law and order situation in educational institutions.

 Dalim Kumar Datta,

 APC Road

 Campuses of schools and colleges should remain out of bounds of outsiders. Not only do people from outside cause law and order problems, but they also distract the students. Except guardians, students and staff, no one should enter colleges. 

 Prasanta Kumar Ghosh,

 Barasat

 Presence of outsiders on college premises shows laxity on the part of the authorities. The principals need to come out of their rooms more often to see how their colleges are functioning. The authorities and the students? unions should ensure that no one loiters on the campus or disturbs girl students.

 D. Bhattacharya,

 Sonarpur

 Law and order problems on campuses can be partially solved by banning the entry of outsiders. It is also extremely essential to stop political interference and ragging in educational institutions.

 Biswajyoti Bagchi, 

 Alipore

 Almost all the colleges have more than one students? union, which are are responsible for disrupting academic activities. Banning the entry of outsiders without permit will surely prevent the law and order problems on campuses. The authorities should make it mandatory for students to carry their identity cards. The gates of the institutions also need to be manned by trained security guards.

 Diptimoy Ghosh,

 Salt Lake

 If outsiders refer to people other than the students and staff, a blanket ban on their entry into campuses is neither practicable nor desirable. It is also not possible for everyone to visit colleges after intimation or setting up an appointment. Several people need to meet the principals and professors or visit the offices for information. If an institution wants to prevent the entry of outsiders, it will have to set up an inquiry counter to issue passes. At best, entry of outsiders into campuses can be controlled. 

Jyoti baksi,

 Heysham Row

 The authorities should draw a lesson from recent incidents and tighten security on campuses. It is not difficult to only allow entry of those with identity cards. The rest should be kept out, unless they are the guardians or relatives of students. 

 Indraneel Mukherjee,

 Nazir Lane

 Although it might seem that the law and order problems on campuses can be solved by banning the entry of outsiders, we need to be more pragmatic. The proposition is impractical and undesirable. What if a professor from another college, a government official or a student?s father wants to enter a college for a specific purpose? Reasonable restrictions would be more fruitful. For that, identity cards need to be issued and the security personnel properly briefed. Also, security needs to be beefed up in secluded areas of the campus.

 Saadia Sitwat,

 Linton Street

 I don?t think that law and order problems on campus can be solved by banning the entry of outsiders. Insiders are quite often behind all fracas in educational institutions. The entire administrative process needs to be made more stringent.

 Debasish Chakraborty,

 Nilmoni Mitra Row

 The students of a college will mostly abide by its rules. They would not dare to create law and order problems on campus. But outsiders do not care about college rules and are at the root of all law violations. Their entry should be banned.

 B.K. Chowdhury,

 Kankinara

 Banning the entry of outsiders is not the solution to campus law and order problems. It is more important to revamp security arrangements on the campus as most untoward incidents occur in secluded spots. The purpose of visit of an outsider should be determined before he or she is allowed inside. The students and staff should be made to carry identity cards.

 B.N. Bose,

 Dum Dum Park

 I feel that banning the entry of outsiders to colleges would improve the law and order situation on the campuses. The students should also cooperate in preventing outsiders from entering the institutes. Those who still manage to make their way in, should be punished in an exemplary manner.

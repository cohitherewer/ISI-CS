 8 injured in explosion 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Eight persons, including two women, were seriously injured when a barrel containing petrol exploded in Purba Bishnupur, on the southern fringes of the city, early on Wednesday. 

 The barrel was kept in a godown, owned by local resident Bishwanath Bakshi. 

 Shortly after midnight on Tuesday, neighbours gathered in front of the godown after noticing smoke billowing out of it. 

 The crowd had entered the godown for a closer look when the barrel exploded. The people who were close to it were injured in the blast. 

 They were admitted to MR Bangur Hospital. The condition of four of the injured was stated to be critical.

 Bakshi is absconding. Police have launched an operation to nab him.

 From campus to a cause

 St Xavier?s College (Cal) Alumni Association (SXCCAA) joined hands with the NSS department of St Xavier?s College to organise a health check-up camp on October 16 in Paikhala, a village adopted by the college.

 Though just an hour?s drive (around 28 km) from Park Street, the hamlet in South 24-Parganas has been neglected for long by the government. The villagers have no access to even basic amenities like proper roads, sanitation, healthcare facilities and education.

 There is no government healthcare centre or hospital within a 15 km-radius of the village. Worse still, because of its remoteness and the poor condition of the roads the government health supervisors skip visits to the village.

But for the 35-odd life members of SXCCAA, the Paikhala 

camp was more important than busy schedules at home for Lakshmi puja. On October 

16, the SXCCAA team of three doctors spent five hours, from 10 am to 3 pm, checking 

around 150 patients and distributing medicines at the camp (picture above shows 

SXCCA members on their way to the camp).

 For quite sometime now, the SXCCAA has been trying to help the villagers, in whichever way possible, to improve their lives. In the past, tubewells have been dug and electricity connections provided to villagers, as a result of the association?s consistent efforts.

 R. Khandelwal of Dhanwantary, which sponsored the medicine distributed to the villagers, said the health camp showed that social work was not just about donating money, but also taking active part in field work.

 Those willing to contribute for this cause can contact Rev. Fr P.C. Mathew S.J. (president, SXCCAA) at principalsxccal.edu.

Tips to scale rare career heights

Tips to scale rare career heightsAkash Nandi wants 

to be a modifier of cars and bikes, a career that does not find encouragement 

at home. Gaurav Nowlakha wants to pursue management studies abroad, immediately 

after Plus II, but didn?t know where to go. Debanik De wants to take up computer 

animation as a profession but wasn?t sure if a mainstream educational institute 

had a course.

It was a bunch of confused minds at The Heritage School 

that faced career counsellor Amrita Dass (picture above by Sudeshna Banerjee) 

who had flown down from the Institute of Career Studies in Lucknow.

 ?Our endeavour is to prepare children not just for the Board exams but also for what happens later. There is a lot of unawareness among parents regarding newly emerging fields like sports medicine and biotechnology. That is why very often children are forced to tread the beaten track,? explained principal Neelkanth Gupta. And that is why the day included a full session with the parents, who came with their own set of doubts.

 Teachers also interacted with Dass, who shared with them the findings of a survey among students from across the country of the qualities they seek in a teacher.

 ?Approachable, encouraging, impartial, command of the subject and the ability to teach it well,? she spelt out one after another, pointing out how attitudinal qualities mattered more to young minds than professional ones. 

 ?Years ago the Kothari Commission had stated that the future of India was being shaped in her classrooms. Sadly, that is happening in few places,? she said, while lauding the school for adopting the interactive technique over the chalk-and-talk method in class.

 The problem of dealing with recalcitrant students without meting out punishment also came up from the floor. Dass stressed on motivation as a factor to turn around such students. ?When nothing works, it is best to speak to them outside class. Once I came across a boy who was completely lost in class. On speaking to him, I realised his father came home drunk every night and beat up his mother. So the root of academic failure can lie elsewhere.?

 Mental alertness was another area that teachers were advised to nurture, by slipping in simple problems of logical deduction in class.

 The students themselves enthusiastically solved such problems during their session. ?I got a prize for guessing the correct number of squares in a diagram,? said Arundhati Gupta of Class X, who had come to find out how to serve the army as a doctor.

 The best part of the seminar was that it was only the beginning of a process. ?The students now become members of our institute and can interact with us directly over e-mail. There are more than 200 career options now. An aptitude test will also take place and we will help them find the ideal career,? Dass said.

Dreaming of Tomorrow

Deserted is the leaf-strewn street, 

Bearing testimony to the wind?s onslaught. 

Lust of fire rapes the lives of green

Such goes the story of life, waiting to be taught. 

Bricks build and bricks fall.

Few survived to claim assistance time and again.

Rest lay stashed neatly in their haven of peace.

Graveyard of muffled sobs is what is left of their happy lane. And yet... 

Forgotten will be the winter at the first hints of spring.

A greater joy will replace the greatest sorrow.

Orphaned by past yet the future?s foster son,

A broken world hopes for a better tomorrow.

(Dedicated to the victims of the recent earthquake)

Puja?s over...

Street-food fanning late-night laughters

Plastic ice cream jackets ? stamped.

Candyfloss daydreams 

Licence to umm...

Maddox cacophony

Rehearsed cosmetic greetings

Baksheesh.

Special discount coupons

High voltage lights

Suddenly switched off.

Emptiness fulfilled.

Floating terracotta petals

Framed and photographed, now

Down the grime of holy waters.

It is over now

Like it never began.

But the wheel continues

For, asche bochhor abar hobe...

...Autumn?s here

Pouring forth in rich fecundity,

The womb of life ripened to the rind,

Its pulsating vessels in ceaseless motion; 

The clamour of drums echoing in the air 

Now growing keener by the day. 

Mellowing warmth of a waning month, 

Unveiling its brocade of rich hues.

The moulded clay unmoulds itself,

The murky waters flow in ever-rich hues,

And the lingering smell of shiulis

Strewn on a spent earth

Spreads its austere shroud.

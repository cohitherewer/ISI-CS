 A little above Bangalore, on a par with Chennai and much below Mumbai and Delhi. That?s how city gamers ? at least in enthusiasm and participation ? have fared in the Indian run-up to World Cyber Games 2005. 

 The tournament is considered to be the video gamers? World Cup, and sees cyber champs from around the globe fighting for top honours, annually. ?This year, around 600 participants tried their skills in the Calcutta qualifying rounds,? said Ozair Qamar, a city representative of Sify, the Internet service provider hosting the championship prelims in India.

 Compare that to around 800 in Delhi and 1,400 in Mumbai ? Bangalore had 500 contestants and Chennai 600 ? and Calcutta?s numbers fail to impress. Calcutta was also the only city with two venues for the prelims. ?But that was more due to lack of space than anything else,? said Naved Qureshi, national marketing manager for Sify Games.

 The city contestant count this time could have been lower ? Reliance Webworld, which had hosted last year?s national prelims, claims there were ?around 15,000? participants ? due to the introduction of a Rs-50 registration fee. ?It proved to be a bit of a barrier, but it also helped filter out non-serious gamers,? explained Qureshi.

 Even if the numbers didn?t match the other metros, the passion more than made up for it, as contestants came from as far as Kharagpur, Cuttack and Bhubaneswar.

 ?We had participants from age 18 to 32, including would-be engineers from IIT Kharagpur and school and college students from around the city. Some even brought their own equipment, like keyboard, mouse and hard disc,? Qamar added.

 Sify is setting up dedicated gaming cyber cafes, called Gamedromes, around the country. ?Soon, there will be 120 Gamedromes in India, including four in Calcutta,? Qureshi said.

 World Cyber Games 2005 features five PC-based games in genres like sports, strategy and action ? Counter Strike 1.6, FIFA Soccer 2005, Need for Speed: Underground 2, Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne and Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War ? where gamers have to display their prowess.

 Nine city winners ? a team of five for Counter Strike 1.6 and one for each of the other games ? will battle for a berth in the national team in Mumbai on October 30. The grand finals of the 2005 edition will be held in Singapore between November 16 and 20.

 This year, 800 players from 70 countries are expected to reach the grand finals in Singapore. Last year, the event held in San Francisco had 642 entries from 63 countries.

 For the first time since the inception of the games in 2000, a mobile gaming segment has been added, with Airtel being the official cellular service provider for India. ?We have just launched our promo campaign in Calcutta and have received a good response,? said an Airtel spokesperson.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Girl at the gates

 Pretty young things, some say, 

 look best on the dance floor. Well, you may have to think 

 again if you want to gate crash at B.E.D (bars, entertainment 

 and dining) next weekend. For, you will be up against the 

 attractive and authoritative BHAVNA SHARMA.

 Goodlife met up with the lady outside the Ballygunge Circular Road party address while she was busy maintaining her trademark strict vigil on the party people?

 Whos that girl: On paper, she is the public relations manager of B.E.D, but on the ground ? or maybe off the floor ? she seems the most visible and vital member of the management.

 Background: If you think she is one happy-go-lucky lady, sold on the fact that partying every night comes with the job, think again. For Bhavna has an electronic engineering degree and an MBA in marketing and systems from Pune University backing her skills.

 Job profile: She is the interface between the night club and its guests and the media. The events, which have become a routine affair at B.E.D, are all planned, co-ordinated and executed by her. Getting those most-important memberships is also her job.

 Best part of the job profile: Meeting new people on the job is a boon in disguise. I get to meet the movers and shakers of the city standing outside the club gates. It is a good way of striking up a rapport and building contacts, smiles Bhavna.

 Toughest ask: Refusing entry to the revellers requires some steel. I feel very bad but if somebody does not fit the norms of the club, he or she cannot be allowed inside, explains Bhavna.

 Comments on the Calcutta party scene: It is still in its nascent stages, feels Bhavna. Pune, her hometown, has a throbbing night life. Pune has a big college-going crowd and the best thing is that it is never stagnant. They keep on moving from one place to another. As a result, there are many amusement options and new entrants in the market have a fair chance of succeeding. The crowd also keeps on changing, says Bhavna. 

 In Calcutta, one would think thrice before starting off a new place as the party circuit here is limited. There is only one set of people out partying.

 I have been in the city for the last three months and I know anybody and everybody who parties. Give it five years and Calcutta will rock, feels Bhavna.

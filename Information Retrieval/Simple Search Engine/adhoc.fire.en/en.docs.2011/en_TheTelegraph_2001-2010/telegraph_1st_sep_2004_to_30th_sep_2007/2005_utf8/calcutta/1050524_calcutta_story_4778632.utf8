 Country quest

 A glimpse of Slovakia as seen in Tales from Europe 

 They emerged from behind the iron curtain after 1989. But even a decade later, not much is known about countries such as Slovenia, Lithuania, Latvia or Estonia.

 Tales from Europe, an eight-part series on BBC World, sees journalist Kirsty Wark embark on an eight-week journey covering 3,000 km to learn more. ?The West still tends to homogenise these countries,? says Wark from London. ?But during my travel, sometimes I couldn?t find any connection between people of two different countries.?

 The countries trekked by her in the spring of 2004 were Slovenia, Hungary, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. And there are different tales to tell about each of them. ?I was struck by Slovenia where I started the journey. It has very little history of its own but has a young and well-educated population. There?s a lack of a central place for people to meet and the big debate there is whether mosques should be allowed for congregation.?

 Estonia had another story to narrate. ?Most people there had relatives who were exiled to Siberia. They are bitter towards the Russians for this but also realise that they have to come to terms with their own past.? Warsaw seemed a ?fantastic city? as ?there?s a huge energy? and ?the country looks determined to be a world player?.

 In the course of the cross-country journey, some images really stuck. ?In Latvia, there were women standing in a queue and performing something called a ?line dance?? In Hungary, I visited the world?s biggest hot spring lakes and had mud slapped all over me.?

 The idea for the series was her own and put forward by IWC Media, the company she formed with television producer husband Alan Clements, to the BBC. ?We know little about the people and their passions in these nations. People do visit them as tourists but that?s about all.?

 Catch Tales from Europe every Thursday at 3 pm on BBC World.

 With Pujas just three weeks away, Christmas is hardly uppermost in too many minds. There are, after all, three more months to go. But when its a question of booking your favourite bake ? cakes and cookies, of course ? for Christmas and New Year, your time starts now.

 So there was quite a turnout when ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton amp; Towers organised its customary Cake Mixing Ceremony at the Spa Caf? on September 12.

 Apart from making good culinary sense, this mixing procedure is seen as a ritual ushering in the festive season, good tidings and happiness all around. 

 Thus, amidst much cheering that afternoon, the chefs of Sonar Bangla and the general manager churned quite a splendid mix. 

 Among the ingredients were fruits like raisins, glazed red cherries, orange peel, tutti-frutti, black currants, dates, dried apricots, figs and prunes.

 There were nuts like walnut, almond flakes, cashew and pistachio. The powdered spices sprinkled into the mix were cardamom, cinnamon, clove, ginger, nutmeg and brown sugar.

 Among the essence and liquor used for the mix were golden syrup, molasses, vanilla essence, lemon essence, orange essence, brandy, dark rum and honey.

 Adding star value to the ritual were actor Arjun Chakraborty, his wife Nilanjana and model-turned-actress-turned-painter Piu Sarkar. Donning chef hats, they all joined in the mixing muddle. 

 I am absolutely delighted to be a part of this ritual. And the smell from the mixture of so many ingredients seems so intoxicating that I am beginning to wish Christmas was not so many months away, gushed Piu.

 Echoing her words were Arjun and Nilanjana. It is indeed a sight to see so many people come together and mix the ingredients. Like Piu, they, too, voiced an impatience for Christmas and the final products from the mix.

 Well, lets just take one thing at a time and raise a toast to the festive season in general.

 Biryani binge

 Long has been the romance between the city and mughlai khana. The Biryani Maha Utsav 2005 at Manthan, therefore, promises to be a hit.

 On till September 25, the food fest at 3, Waterloo Street takes you on a journey of delectable biryanis from various gharanas and authentic flavours from Lucknow, Hyderabad, Bangladesh...

 Look out for specialities from Bangladesh like Padma Nadir Paar Theke, including Ilish Machher Biryani and Chingri Machher Biryani. Rice and fish are synonymous with the Bengali palate and biryani has been a favourite with them for years. So we thought of offering them a dish that included all their favourites, smiles chef Ajit Banerji from Bangladesh. 

 Those interested in Nawabi fare have the Lucknowi Gharana Se to choose from. The menu here offers Nawabi Gosht Biryani, Nawabi Murgh Biryani and Lucknowi Subz Biryani. You can also enjoy a biryani spread from the city of the Charminar. Hyderabadi Khazana includes Hyderabadi Gosht Biryani, Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani and Hyderabadi Subz Biryani. The Lucknowi and Hyderabadi spreads are specialities of chef Omar Ali from Hyderabad.

 The biryani is served in traditional mud handis and each portion comes with a complimentary round of Scotch, a pint of beer or soft drinks. Prices, excluding taxes, range from Rs 89 to Rs 109.

 Baked bites

 The Taj Bengals Bread and Cookie Festival at La Patisserie till September 27 is just what the baker ordered.

 As executive chef Sujan Mukherjee explains: The festival gives Calcuttans an opportunity to experience bread types from all over the world.

 The bread section brings together 12 kinds originating from different parts of the world. For instance, the Bran and Raisin Loaf (made of bran, whole wheat flour and raisin) is of Mexican origin, while the Beer and Cheese Bread (yeast-less with beer and mozzarella cheese) and Butter Milch Brot (fresh yoghurt, butter and liquid glucose) are of German origin. 

 Then you have the Italian Foccacia (made with olive oil, basil and rosemary-stuffed olive) and the French Jalapeno and Corn Bread (made of jalapeno pepper and American corn).

 so on offer is the Seven Seeded Crown Bread (made with multi-grain flour with seeds) that originated in Belgium, the Jewish Challah and much more.

 The cookies come in distinct flavours. The range includes goodies like Crackled Top (made with melted chocolate, white butter and castor sugar), Granola (made with brown sugar, raisins, muesli and peanut butter) and Chunky Double Chocolate (brown sugar, dark and white chocolate). 

 The calorie conscious can have the Black Currant Cookies (made with a sugar-free batter, Black Currant and semolina).

 Vegetarians need not be disappointed, for they have egg-less options like Crunchy Peanut Butter Cookies (a combination of peanut butter and roasted crushed peanut) and Marble Butter Cookies (made of bitter chocolate, white butter and icing sugar).

 The Florentine (made from candied peel, golden syrup and glazed cherry) is a must-try in this section. 

 The cookie corner also has savouries like Crushed Black Pepper and Parmesan Cheese.

 Everything is fresh and handmade, assures chef Mukherjee.

 Breads come for Rs 35-plus, while the cookies start at Rs 15.

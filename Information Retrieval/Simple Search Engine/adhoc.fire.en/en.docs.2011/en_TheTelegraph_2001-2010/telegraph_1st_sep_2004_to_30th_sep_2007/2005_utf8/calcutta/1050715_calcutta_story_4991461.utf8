The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Ruse of missing morgue

 - Three hospitals hoodwinked inspectors about lack of facility

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 Hoodwinking Medical Council of India (MCI) inspectors seems to be a common affliction of our state-run hospitals.

 If SSKM Hospital?s ENT department had managed to fool the medical inspectors, it?s a morgue ? or rather the lack of it ? in three leading hospitals that has now left them cold.

 RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital and SSKM Hospital do not have even one morgue to conduct post-mortem examinations or teach forensic sciences and medico-legal issues, a mandatory norm for running an undergraduate course.

 ?A morgue is an essential criterion for imparting medical education in an undergraduate college. It seems we have been taken for a ride by the hospitals during our inspections. We will definitely take action once a complaint is lodged with us,? A.R.N. Swetalabad, chairman of MCI, told Metro from Delhi.

 Metro had reported on Thursday how the state health department and SSKM authorities had managed to pull a fast one over the MCI inspectors when they were checking out the ENT facilities. The inspectors were told that audiometry tests were conducted on campus, whereas no such thing is done and hundreds of ear surgeries are conducted ?blindfolded?.

 As for masking a missing morgue, all that the hospitals do is put up a makeshift signboard on a rundown building when inspectors do the rounds.

 ?One of the buildings near our outdoor department is shown as a morgue during every inspection, but I have never seen a dead body in the building in the past four years I have been in college,? said a student of surgery at Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital.

 The ones to suffer the most are budding doctors. Their exposure to a post-mortem is restricted to the couple of times they are taken to either the Mominpur (Katapukur) morgue or to NRS or Medical College and Hospital.

 Now, fearing a crackdown by the MCI, a move for morgues is afoot. ?Setting up morgues in these institutions is a key MCI criteria. We have asked the government to act immediately,? said Gautam Mukherjee, secretary, association of health service doctors.

 Pradip Mitra, RG Kar superintendent, said: ?Students will benefit greatly, once we have our own morgue.?

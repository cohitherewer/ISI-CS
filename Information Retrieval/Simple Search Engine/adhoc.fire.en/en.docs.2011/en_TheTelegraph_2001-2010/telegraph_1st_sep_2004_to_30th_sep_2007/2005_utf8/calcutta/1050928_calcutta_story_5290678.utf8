 With a boom of restaurants, malls, multiplexes and boutiques in and around Salt Lake, the satellite city is really happening.

 And Rani Kahini, a newly-opened designer studio in Labony market (shop no. 13), is catering to the changing fashion needs of the locality and beyond.

 The boutique specialises in a wide array of saris, though salwar suits, skirts, tops and accessories are also on offer.

 I specialise in a variety of saris, ranging from casual-wear cottons to heavy silks for occasion wear. Every piece is unique since I dont repeat the designs, says designer Abira Roy Chowdhury.

 Block print, gold print and fabric paint on taant lend a designer touch to the Bengal handloom saris.

 A special offering for the Pujas are Mix Match saris ? taant embellished with a combination of sequins, applique, kantha stitch, block prints and shells or wooden beads.

 Priced at Rs 700-plus, these are the hottest selling items in the countdown to the Pujas, reveals Abira.

 The other rage this festive season is Patli Pallu taant saris, where the aanchal and pleats are heavily worked, while the rest of the body is relatively plain, she adds. 

 Silks are adorned with intricate and exquisite kantha stitch, zardosi and aari work in innovative patterns. There are lighter printed silks for regular wear, too.

 Party wear chiffons and georgettes are worked upon with sequins and touches of embroidery. 

 While the taant range starts as low as Rs 250, the silk saris are priced at Rs 2,500 and more. The chiffons and georgettes come for anything above Rs 800.

 Men are not left out either. Theres a range of kurtas for them with fabric painting and kantha stitch.

 The price tag starts at Rs 500.

 Fusion focus

 As boutiques mushroom in the city with the same rapidity as beauty parlours or Montessori schools, theres hardly a locality that doesnt boast a designer studio.

 Ninth Dimension, a boutique in Baguiati, by NiFD graduate Bobbita Das, has been meeting local demands for quite some time now.

 The store now boasts a brand new collection for the festive days. Ethnic, western as well as a lot of fusion clothes are on offer, with an emphasis on embroidery. Saris and salwar suits are hand-worked with stitches like Gujarati, Kashmiri, kantha and Parsi as well as zardosi and sequins. 

 Even all my western wear like skirts, tops and trousers bear touches of hand-embroidery since thats my forte, says Bobbita.

 The western wear is mostly in cotton, though silks, georgettes and chiffons are the chosen fabrics for the saris. The saris start at Rs 2,000, while the western garments are priced at Rs 1,000-plus.

 Bag buys

 The Turn, a boutique at 194, Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Road, has been specialising in designer bags and kurtis for the past two years. 

 For this festive season, designer Shubhra Agarwalla has come up with a line of jazzy party bags in pure silk and various blends of silk.

 Handbags of various kinds ? potlis, strap bags and clutches ? are worked on with zardosi, sequins and beads. The bags are priced between Rs 600 and Rs 1,500.

 so on offer are kurtis in pure cottons and crepes. Embellished with hand-embroidery, these come semi-stitched and are tailored according to a customers measurements. 

 The kurtis starting from Rs 400 offer value for money.

 For India, youth is the niche market

 SUBHRO SAHA

 MALL MANTRA 

 Customers are fickle, often running to try the latest flavour. A mall operator has to focus on building customer loyalty, the details of running a property, and most importantly, balancing being a landlord with being a place-maker 

 The worlds only retail anthropologist, Paco Underhill, will be in town this week to speak at Retail 2005, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) summit on retail and retailing activity in the eastern region. Underhill has been advising Fortune 100 companies on behaviours and motivations of contemporary consumers and was the first social scientist to apply tools of behavioural research to the retail environment. 

 Ahead of his maiden visit to India, the retail guru, author of the best-selling Why We Buy, spoke to Goodlife on e-mail. Excerpts: 

 Calcutta is seeing a retail revolution both on the high streets and in the malls, and every new place is greeted with euphoria. What should be done to guard against saturation?

 Across much of the developing world, malls are being built at a furious pace. The challenge isnt how they do in their first five years, but how they do in the second five years. Customers are fickle, often running to try the latest flavour. A mall operator has to focus on building customer loyalty, the details of running a property, and most importantly, balancing being a landlord with being a place-maker. 

 Across the world, retail experts are talking about the need to set up specialised malls. Is that the way forward in a relatively nascent scenario like Calcutta as well? If so, what kind of specialised or narrow-focus malls can we look forward to? 

 At least in the First World, retail success seems to be based on either specialising or genericising. For India I image several possible niche markets. First is youth. Across the globe the differences among how generations shop is very distinctive. The second is kid-focussed. In Brazil and South Africa, the malls that have a home focus have worked very well. In the US, the high-end and the outlet mall have both worked.

 What should the traditional shopping districts, which have seen their footfalls hijacked by the new-age malls, do by way of reinvention to stay afloat?

 Business Improvement Districts or BIDs have helped in other places in the world. BIDs work on cleanliness and safety issues. They try and improve access issues from parking to public transportation. Also, BIDs work on merchant education. They develop and enforce streetscape standards. 

 Can you shed light on some new tools and best practices that are being used to increase footfalls internationally?

 As stated earlier ? place-making is commercial real-estate art form. It may be event-making, or inclusion of non-traditional tenants from theatres, museums and libraries to houses of worship and schools. One mall in New York City gives one of their public spaces to a tango school. On a grander scale ? most developers want to do the ALL business, not the MALL business. That means their projects include housing, commercial office space and hotels where they are building a secure walk-in customer base. 

 What is the right format for retail malls in a tropical place like Calcutta? Is a combination of inside-outside the correct choice, or should we have big boxes? 

 Its an issue that mall developers from Brazil and South Africa to Dubai have wrestled with. The result has been some combination of both. Air-conditioned escape from the heat and outdoor spaces for evening gathering and programming.

 Faced with the onslaught of foreign brands, what should the local players do to grow their own products? 

 obal versus local is a battle being fought across the world. If the advantage started with the global brands, in many markets, a shift is happening. In the US for example, while the business media focusses on the top five retail brands, Wal-Mart, Home Depot, Target, Kroger and Albertsons, the most profitable and fastest growing retail players are in the second and third tiers. They are regional players that know their local markets, are more creative with their sourcing and are positioned to be nimble ? and most importantly, execute on the retail basics, being clean, in-stock and well managed.

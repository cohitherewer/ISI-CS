The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Tourists under duress in Srinagar 

Srinagar tourists stranded

 - Families from Calcutta held captive in hotel after tour agent flees

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mother Rekha Dutta and daughter Sangeeta 

 ?Daddy we are stranded here. They won?t let us go? this is a hostage situation?please do something.?

 When banker Sadhan Dutta got this call on his mobile phone early in the morning from his daughter, his heart sank. Only a few days ago, he had seen off wife Rekha and daughter Sangeeta on a dream tour of Jammu and Kashmir.

 But his worst fears came true after his family, along with a few other tourists, were held captive in Srinagar ? not by militants but by rogue tour operators.

 All the tourists had paid the Calcutta-based tour agency, Parjatak, in advance but the families were neither given tickets, nor did they have the cash to pay their hotel bills and the fare to take them back home. 

 Late on Wednesday afternoon, Bowbazar police detained two persons from the agency, who promised to pay up within 24 hours. 

 Back in Kashmir, six women and a man from three families in Calcutta, on a tour of the dream destination, are being ?held hostage? in a Srinagar lodge after Parjatak, which had pledged to take care of the group, deserted them.

 ?Our first stop on the 19-day tour of the Valley was in Pahalgam last Saturday. At night, the guide escaped, leaving us stranded. We had all booked our tour with a Rabindra Sarani-based agency, known as Parjatak. We called up, but its officials said that nothing was wrong and everything would be sorted out,? said Rama Kayal, a middle-aged woman over phone from Srinagar. 

 After trying in vain to locate the guide, the tourists contacted the tour agency?s office in Calcutta to find out why the man had disappeared. 

 ?Please don?t worry. You can proceed to Srinagar, where we have booked rooms for you at Rubina Guest House,? said Sangeeta Dutta, quoting Parjatak officers. 

 The families also had to pay Rs 3,000 as room rent for the Pahalgam hotel. Her father, Sadhan, had already paid about Rs 30,000 to Parjatak for his family?s trip. ?I opted out of the trip at the last moment because of urgent office work. Before they left, I had made all payments to the agency, but now I am worried,? said Sadhan, an SBI manager. 

 After reaching Srinagar, the tourists had great difficulty reaching the lodge, located at Bachwara Chowk, near Dal Lake. ?We learnt to our horror that the guest house was not booked at all. We begged them to allow us to stay. They obliged, but we are now on our own,? said A.K. Goswami, the only male member of the group. 

 ?Everybody was terrified and I had to take charge and tell them not to lose heart,? said Goswami, a city-based businessman accompanied by his wife. He spoke to Metro over phone from Srinagar.

 ?We decided to stay put, but when there was no word from Calcutta, we panicked,? said Bibi Guha, a 62-year-old retired government employee, who wants to visit Amarnath.

 But Srinagar lodge-owner Md Khayam told them that they would not be allowed to leave until Parjatak paid the Rs 15,000 plus outstandings. 

 No one was available at Parjatok?s office for comment. ?The moment we get our money, they are free to go,? a hotel officer said over the telephone from Srinagar.

Childhood memories lead me back to the Oceanic Hotel in Mombasa, Kenya ? a few days of idyllic enjoyment and much of this centred around the dining table. The restaurant to which the family gravitated did not have a buffet ? they were not the done thing in those days ? and neither was there an elaborate a la carte menu. Each meal ?breakfast, lunch or dinner ?had the days choice printed artistically on a crisp white card on a silver stand.

 Taking a decision was simple. For each course there were only two or three choices. But the chefs imagination was always at work and no two breakfasts, lunches or dinners needed to bear much resemblance to each other, even over a period of a fortnight, unless the person choosing was unadventurous. It was strictly Continental cuisine (multi-cuisine was unheard of in those days) and a typical luncheon might be a choice of soups (cold consomme or a hot soup), a choice of hors doeuvre, a main course of fish, poultry or red meat accompanied by a variety of breads, and then dessert. And for the adults, a choice of fine wines to complement the meal.

 When a chef gets to work in the morning with the dreams of the night before focussed on eight or 10 creations, the chances of excellence are much higher. For the diner, it is better for he or she does not have to pore over a multitude of items and even perhaps end up with a selection that is incompatible. A set-piece meal such as this has the potential to be a fine dining experience.

 When The Park announced the arrival of their new Executive Chef ? Monsieur Yvonnick Jegat Deniau from Brittany in France ? the occasion was marked by exactly such a meal. The lunch started with a cold soup, followed by a choice of hors doeuvre; then came the main course ? a choice between salmon, lamb and a cottage cheese and vegetable lasagna ? and finally dessert. I shall describe the items I had. 

 Andalusian Gaspacho with Basil Marinated Grilled Prawn is a traditional Spanish soup in which a selection of Mediterranean vegetables such as tomatoes, cucumber, sweet peppers and onions are made into a puree with olive oil and seasoning. Nothing is cooked. Perched on the edge of the bowl was the prawn ? like a garnish. For vegetarians, a black olive took its place.

 The starter I chose was Chicken Liver Mousse and Smoked Breast of Duck with Sour Strawberry Sauce, a typically French item. Chicken livers are pan fried with onion and garlic and are flamb?d with brandy. Lots of butter and whipped cream are added and the whole is put in a blender and smoothened further by putting it through a sieve. After letting it rest to get a creamy consistency, dollops of this mousse are put on to small pieces of toasted French bread and a thin slice of smoked breast of duck is wrapped around each piece. On the plate surrounding these delicious delights is smeared the Strawberry Sauce ? strawberries cooked with vinegar and sugar and blended. One of the best items I have ever tasted. 

 Escalope of Salmon with Red Onion and Meat Reduction on Mini Ratatouille Nicoise was the main course. Pink Salmon (imported from Norway) is marinated in garlic and lemon juice and lightly grilled. The Ratatouille is made by dicing vegetables such as tomatoes, yellow and green zucchini, a variety of sweet peppers and aubergines into small cubes and pan frying these in olive oil with green herbs such as basil, dill, chives and parsley. The sauce for this dish is made by roasting chicken bones with vegetables and tomato paste, adding water and letting it cook for 24 hours. This is put through a strainer and cooked with saut?d onions, butter and red wine till it reduces to one-tenth of its original volume. This delectable item is a speciality from the South of France. 

 Two kinds of wine were served with this meal ? red Beanjolais and white Chablis. Dessert was a choice between Mango Parfait in Chocolate Cup and Blackcurrant Delice. 

 An excellent experience, this course-by-course meal is particularly suited to Continental cuisine. Many of these items will be available at the Atrium by mid-June and chef Yvonnick has hopes of laying out such a spread about once a month for 50 odd diners. I will try to be there every time.

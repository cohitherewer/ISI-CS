 Tizzy over mobile phone

 - Recovery made from toilet drainpipe of extortionist?s cell

 RAVIK BHATTACHARYA

 About a year ago, a mobile phone was discovered in the cell of Aftab Ansari, mastermind in the American Center shootout case. On Friday, it was the turn of dreaded extortionist Gopal Tiwari.

 A sophisticated mobile phone was found in his Presidency jail cell during the day.

 Deputy inspector-general of prisons Ramapada Bhattacharya confirmed on Friday night that the cell phone was recovered from Tiwari?s cell while he was being produced in Bankshal court. 

 Tiwari was arrested a few months ago in Hyderabad in connection with an attempt to murder case in the Posta area. Later, Prabhu Shankar Agarwal, owner of the Haldiram?s chain, too, was arrested for hiring killer Tiwari.

 ?Some warders on duty are being interrogated to find out if they have a hand in this matter,? added Bhattacharya.

 The discovery of a mobile phone in Tiwari?s cell, which falls under a high-security zone, sent the authorities into a tizzy. 

 It prompted a massive search inside Presidency jail throughout the day. The detective department in Lalbazar has been asked to delve deeper into Tiwari?s current links. 

 Months of patient effort on the part of the jail authorities, led by Soumik Sarkar, Jailer 1, paid off on Friday. The jail authorities had been tipped off that Tiwari had been using a mobile phone for the past few weeks to keep in touch with his gang. 

 Tiwari left the jail at 10 am for a hearing in court. Soumik Sarkar led a team of officers into Tiwari?s cell, located at 23/44 block, a ?high-security? zone on the jail premises.

 The first effort to find the phone drew a blank. Later, while searching inside the bathroom, a brand new Panasonic GD 55 mobile phone was found inside the toilet.

 ?The mobile phone was kept deep inside the drainpipe, wrapped in three sheets of plastic. It was switched off, but we found evidence that a number of calls had been made as well as received from the phone. An investigation has begun and the phone will be handed over to experts to verify the numbers to and from which calls had been received and made,? said an officer of the jail.

 According to the jail authorities, when the jailer failed to locate the mobile phone, an informer was planted near his cell. 

 The informer confirmed the existence and use of the phone. Though Tiwari used the phone, other gang members in the same jail mostly carried it. The final word came from the informer on Friday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Different Oscar strokes for different folks 

(From top) Martin Scorsese directing Leonardo 

DiCaprio in The Aviator, Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles in Ray, Clint 

Eastwood and Hillary Swank in Million Dollar Baby, and Kate Winslet in 

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind 

 Depending on the time of the day when you are reading this, either the Oscars are happening live on your telly or are over and done with. Metro asked some film buffs across the city and beyond who they thought should win the statuettes in the main categories. Here?s what they felt on Sunday?

 Ken Ghosh (film-maker): This year, the Hollywood film for me has been The Aviator. The scale and the intimacy of the film are so well balanced. It is a personal story told in a huge way. Both Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese have been able to complement each other beautifully. So Aviator should definitely win the Best Picture Oscar. As for the Best Director, it has to be Scorsese. For me, he has to do some really bad work to not like his creation. With Aviator, he has gone a step ahead.

 The Best Actor should go to Johnny Depp for Finding Neverland. He is sensitively beautiful in the film and it?s such a departure from his role in The Pirates of the Caribbean. Hillary Swank should get the Best Actress for Million Dollar Baby since I didn?t like of what I saw of the rest. 

 Vinta Nanda (film-maker): The Aviator should sweep the awards this year. The Best Film should go to Aviator, of course, and the Best Director to Martin Scorsese. Leonardo DiCaprio should win the Best Actor for the same film. But the Best Actress should go to Hillary Swank for her brilliant performance in Million Dollar Baby. The Supporting awards should go to Thomas Haden Church for Sideways and Natalie Portman for Closer.

 Priyanshu Chatterjee (actor): I think the Best Film should go to Ray. It showcases a very interesting life, that of Ray Charles, in a very realistic way. The Blacks have never been given their due credit. It?s definitely payback time. The film is deserving of the award as it is. But awards like these will give the Blacks the boost to do more mainstream work. The Best Actor should go to Jamie Foxx, as well, for his brilliant portrayal of the great singer. Also, whatever little I have read about him in magazines and on the Net, he is an honest, jovial kind of fellow.

 I would personally want Martin Scorsese to win the Best Director award for The Aviator. And Kate Winslet is a personal favourite for the Best Actress category in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.

 Mandira Bedi (actress): Unfortunately, I haven?t been able to see most of the films that are in the running for this year?s Oscars. The only movie that I have seen is Martin Scorsese?s The Aviator and I found it quite brilliant. It should sweep the awards this year. The film is a tad too long but the character of Howard Hughes is brilliant, someone you can look up to. Leonardo DiCaprio and Cate Blanchett are both brilliant in the movie. 

 Bikram Ghosh (actor-percussionist): I am a huge fan of Clint Eastwood. He has this huge range and variety. I would love to see him win the Best Director award for Million Dollar Baby. As for Best Actor, I would root for Johnny Depp for his role in Finding Neverland. The Best Film award should go to The Aviator. Although I haven?t seen it yet, there?s a lot of buzz about it. Annette Bening has been a personal favourite ? would love to see her win the Best Actress for Being Julia.

 Aveek Mukhopadhyay (cinematographer): The Best Picture and the Best Director should always go to the same film ? otherwise it just doesn?t seem right. And this year it should go to The Aviator and Martin Scorsese. He has come out of the style that made him such a favourite of ours in films like Raging Bull and Taxi Driver. He has become very Hollywoodish in the recent past. His subjects have changed, so has his visual style. But he is still better than the rest. As for the acting awards, I haven?t been able to see most of the films in the race but I like the work of Johnny Depp and Annette Bening.

 Anjan Dutt (film-maker-musician): While I haven?t seen many of the films in contention, I have seen Ray and Jamie Foxx is just incredible as Ray Charles. Perhaps, he should get the award. As for Best Director, well, Martin Scorsese is the most beautiful director around. For pure emotional reasons I would want him to win ? he having lost out for some of his best films. If not now, when? Clint Eastwood also is getting better and better as he is getting older. But still Scorsese at this age should get the nod. I can?t really talk about the other awards without having seen the rest of the films.

 June (actress): For the Best Actor, I think it is a toss-up between Leonardo DiCaprio and Jamie Foxx for The Aviator and Ray. I?ll be happy if either of them wins. The Best Film too is between Ray and Aviator. I am a diehard fan of Martin Scorsese, so would like him to win the Best Director. As for the Best Actress, Annette Bening is one of my favourites. Kate Winslet, too, is very good in Eternal Sunshine? whatever little I have seen of the film. So it will be between Kate and Annette.

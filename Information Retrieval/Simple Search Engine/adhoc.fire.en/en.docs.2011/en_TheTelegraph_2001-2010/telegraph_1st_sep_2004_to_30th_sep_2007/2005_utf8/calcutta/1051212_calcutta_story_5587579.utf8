 Traffic chaos on BT Road. A Telegraph picture

 Work on widening BT Road comes to a close in February. And the public works and state transport departments have taken up another project to manage traffic and pedestrians better on the six-lane thoroughfare.

 As part of the plan, 12 bus bays and stands for taxis and autorickshaws will be identified on the widened stretch between Tallah Bridge and Dunlop. Besides, road medians and guard rails will be installed and zebra crossings marked.

 According to PWD engineers, bus bays will be marked on both sides of the road at six major points ? Paikpara, Chiria More, Rabindra Bharati University campus, Sinthee More, Indian Statistical Institute campus and Dunlop.

 There will also be spaces for parking taxis, Matadors and autorickshaws.

 ?Earlier, vehicles plied at a maximum speed of 25 to 30 kph on the road. Following the increase in the road width from seven to 11 metres, the maximum speed is 50-plus,? said Ajay Das, executive traffic and transportation engineer.

 ?However, the speed corridor has simultaneously become accident prone, with three persons being run over this year. Hence, we?re introducing guard rails on the median to prevent pedestrians from crossing the road at any point,? Das added. 

 The safe-traffic project will cost the PWD Rs 56 lakh and the transport department Rs 24 lakh.

 The Rs 9.84-crore project for widening the five-km stretch, between Tallah and Dunlop, was taken up by the PWD in April 2004. In order to facilitate widening, electric poles on both sides have been relocated to the one-metre-wide median.

 ?Work is on only at two sites ? the BT Road-Bonhooghly intersection, near the ISI campus, and the stretch under Dunlop Bridge, where we are thinking of concretising the road so that it can support the Calcutta Municipal Corporation?s 72-inch-diameter pipelines running under it. Widening will be complete by February,? said a PWD engineer.

 Serving as the principal artery between Calcutta and North 24-Parganas, BT Road is used by more than 800 vehicles an hour during peak time.

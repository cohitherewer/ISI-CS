 The Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur, has embarked on a massive expansion plan, which will almost triple its size, at a cost of Rs 950 crore.

 ?We have asked the state to provide 100 acres of land, close to our institute, to open another campus. We are also planning to apply for another 100 acres near the Kona Expressway,? said vice-chancellor Nikhil Ranjan Banerjea. The existing campus is spread across 121 acres.

 The institute is the country?s second-oldest engineering centre and will celebrate its 150th anniversary on November 24, 2006.

 Banerjea met Union human resources development minister Arjun Singh in New Delhi on April 18 and discussed the blueprint for upgrading the university.

 Additional secretary in the Union higher education department Sudip Banerjee has called a meeting of the heads of seven engineering institutions, including the one in Shibpur, to discuss a comprehensive plan for expansion. All seven are set to be declared institutes of national importance.

 ?We require Rs 200 crore immediately and another Rs 750 crore over the next three to four years for the expansion,? Banerjea told Metro. He said the university wanted to be among the 10 best in the country.

 ?We want to include in our curriculum the emerging areas in technology, like power electronics, disaster engineering, nano-science and technology, and very large-scale integration,? the vice-chancellor said. ?We will also set up bio-technology, chemical engineering and food processing departments.? 

 Under the Centre-initiated Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme, the state government has already sanctioned Rs 50 crore for the university. The grant will be spent on upgrading the infrastructure.

 ?We will build a 1,000-capacity central auditorium for Rs 10 crore. We are appealing to our alumni to help us with funds,? the vice-chancellor said. The campus has also urged the University Grants Commission to release Rs 2.5 crore for setting up a central library.

 Calcutta Port Trust is presently undertaking a feasibility study for a water-treatment plant on campus. A sum of Rs 6 crore will be invested for the plant, which will treat the Hooghly water for use by the university.

 Vice-chancellor Banerjea added: ?Around Rs 8 crore is being spent on constructing a 16-floor academy building. We have already set up an eight-floor building on our own. The academy building, too, is likely to be built with our own resources.?

 The university wants to strengthen its ties with the industry to earn more revenue and help students get lucrative jobs. ?We do a lot of projects for both the government and the industry. We also work for organisations like the Defence Research and Development Organisation and Indian Space Research Organisation. We now want to expand the horizon,? Banerjea signed off.

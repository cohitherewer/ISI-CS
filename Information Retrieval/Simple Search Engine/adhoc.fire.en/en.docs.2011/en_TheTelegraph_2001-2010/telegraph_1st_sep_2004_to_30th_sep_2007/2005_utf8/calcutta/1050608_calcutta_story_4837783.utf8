 Latest Pakistani pop sensation Ali Zafar speaks to Pratim D. Gupta about switching art forms, his new album and future plans

 An artist, a model and a singer, its hard to label Ali Zafar. But with his debut album Huqa Pani releasing in India under the Universal label, he tells Goodlife that he is ultimately a musician.

 Talent turn

 A painter at 16 years, a fashion model two years later and a singer par excellence since, Ali has been there and done it all. To me, all art forms are interconnected, says Ali. Doing one particular thing in a certain way can be applied to other things. 

 So there was Ali doing an honours course in painting from Pakistans National College of Arts after being trained in basic classical vocal and harmonium for two years at Nazir Ahmed Music Society in Government College, Lahore.

 The different art forms attracted me at different ages, he explains. At the age I am now, music attracts me most. I can now say music is closest to my heart.

 Winning edge

 It was Alis first single Channo and his debut album Huqa Pani thereafter that made Alis music popular all over Pakistan. It also won him the best album trophy at the Lux Style Awards 2004 in Dubai and the Indus Music Awards 2004 in Lahore. He also bagged the same honour at the Asian Bollywood awards in Dubai.

 Ali admits a lot of hard work went behind the album. I wanted every song in the album to sound different, reveals Ali. To achieve that, and not to allow monotony set in, I got the songs recorded at different studios with different musicians. I also tried to sing each song in a different way, the way the tune demanded.

 But Ali cant categorise his music. Its pretty hard to define my music, he feels. Its a hardcore pop album but my classical singing has come to use in the songs. I havent tried to flaunt my classical skills. Perhaps in my next album, there will be a couple of tracks which are more classical than the rest.

 Inspired stuff

 Bollywood and Pakistani music have become inseparable, says Ali. I have been a huge fan of Indian film music created in the 1960s and 70s, he says. But thereafter, I feel, the music in Bollywood hit a dead end. These days only (A.R.) Rahman and Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy are doing good job. The rest is very stagnant. The same arrangements of sthayi and antara?

 Is that why there has been a lot of Pakistani music in Bollywood movies? Here, the music is much more raw, points out Ali. 

 These tracks have never been heard before. So Bollywood people take them and sometimes use the raw tunes very well. If you improve the melody, its fine with me. But when you kill the songs, it does hurt.

 Would Ali, like Meera before him, join the Bollywood bandwagon if approached by a Mahesh Bhatt? 

 Yes, I am open to singing for an Indian film. In fact, I had signed for a film named In the Name of God as an actor alongside Naseeruddin Shah, but I couldnt finish it due to prior commitments and shifting dates.

 Whats next?

 Whatever be the fate of Huqa Pani here, Ali has decided to record some of the songs of his next album in India. I have composed all the songs for my next album, he reveals. Even the writing is finished. I will definitely record some of the tracks in India some time soon.

 His next venture will be a touch more classical but it will be pop all the same. I plan to cut out all the mistakes I made with my debut album and to improve the sound.

 Bob Geldof

Aid allies

 l ldquo;Over my dead body, rdquo; Bob Geldof had screamed, when suggestions were first made to him about organising another Live Aid. But he finally relented and next month, the world will witness top musical acts get together for the people of Africa again.

 Live 8 will see five concerts simultaneously being held on July 2 at London rsquo;s Hyde Park and venues in Philadelphia, Paris, Rome and Berlin.

 Those confirmed to play include Madonna, Paul McCartney, Coldplay, Elton John, Robbie Williams, Will Smith, Stevie Wonder, 50 Cent, Youssou N rsquo;Dour, Jamiroquai, A-ha and Duran Duran. The Spice Girls are also rumoured to be getting together for the cause.

 The aim will be to raise awareness of Make Poverty History, a campaign to get the richest nations in the world to cancel debt and increase aid to developing countries, and to promote fair trade.

 ldquo;Live 8 is part of a day of action across the world which kick-starts The Long Walk to Justice that calls on the leaders of the world rsquo;s richest countries to act when they meet in Gleneagles on July 6-9, rdquo; said Geldof.

 A text message lottery to determine who will get tickets for the UK concert has seen over a million responses.

 Geldof, along with Midge Ure, had organised 1985 rsquo;s Live Aid for the poverty-stricken people of Africa which has raised over $100 million so far.

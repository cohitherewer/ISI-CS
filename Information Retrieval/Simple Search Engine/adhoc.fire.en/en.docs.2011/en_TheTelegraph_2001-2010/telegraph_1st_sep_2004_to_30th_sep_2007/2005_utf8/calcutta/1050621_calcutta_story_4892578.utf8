 Schools struggle with new subject

 - Lack of trained teachers hits environment study

 RICHA BANSAL

 The Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations has made it mandatory for all affiliated schools to introduce environmental education from this academic session. 

 Post-summer vacation, the schools are, however, struggling to teach the subject.

 The council?s decision follows a Supreme Court ruling making environmental education compulsory for Classes IX to XII, starting from the batch appearing for their board examinations in 2007.

 According to school authorities, the syllabus for the subject ? provided for Classes I to XII ? though relatively simple at the junior level, is quite complex for senior classes.

 ?There is a bit of everything ? geography, history, physics, chemistry, civics, economics?,? said Herbert George, principal, MP Birla Foundation Higher Secondary School. ?It is a tough subject and we do not have qualified teachers.?

 Other schools affiliated to the board face the same dilemma. Most are making do with makeshift arrangements. Teachers of other subjects are tackling different portions of the environment education syllabus.

 ?We will have to find specialised teachers,? asserted Father Jacob, principal, Don Bosco School, Park Circus. ?It would have been better if we had been given more time to introduce the subject.?

 The schools received the syllabus between April and June, when the summer vacations were on. Since most schools had drawn up their schedules for the new session by then, they had to make alternative arrangements. 

 ?During our last meeting with the council in January, we were made to understand that the subject would be introduced in the junior classes and gradually incorporated at the senior level. We did not know that the subject would be made compulsory from this year,? said Sister Smitha Thomas, principal, Our Lady Queen of the Missions School, Park Circus.

 J.K. Sen, principal, Julien Day School, Ganganagar, and secretary, Association of Heads of Anglo Indian Schools in West Bengal, however, stated: ?There is not much of a problem in introducing the subject. But lack of trained teachers might become a point of concern later.?

 Sister Thomas countered: ?It is a matter of concern for me right now. Though we are teaching the subject, I don?t think we will be able to do justice to the students.? 

 Textbooks of the subject, for Classes IX to XII, are still under publication. They are likely to be available only next month. Books for Classes I to VIII will be printed later.

 C.R. Gasper, principal, St Augustine?s Day School, is planning to set up a resource team of teachers to handle the subject. ?A core team will do the research work and then guide the teachers in teaching the subject,? he explained.

 G. Arathoon, deputy secretary of the council, said: ?We will definitely arrange a workshop for teachers, where we will train them on teaching the subject and the evaluation process. But I can?t say at the moment when it will happen.?

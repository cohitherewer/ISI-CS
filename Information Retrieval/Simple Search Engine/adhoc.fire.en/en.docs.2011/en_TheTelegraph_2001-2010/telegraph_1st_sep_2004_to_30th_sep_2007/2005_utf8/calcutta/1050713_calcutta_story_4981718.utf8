The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Diesel devil in fudge race

 - Maintenance minimal, beeline for pass-for-fee test centres

 Only one out of the 508 diesel-driven 

 vehicles that rolled into the Diamond Harbour Road pollution-under-control 

 (PUC) centre last month failed the auto emission test.

 Lies, damn lies and statistics 

 ? the age-old saying is coming true in the context of auto 

 emission test results for diesel-driven vehicles in the 

 city. 

 ?Vehicular pollution can be attributed 

 to problems in engine, quality of fuel, lack of maintenance 

 and overloading. That?s why half the diesel-driven vehicles 

 ? primarily commercial ones ? can seldom pass an auto emission 

 test,? explained Asim Banerjee, secretary, auto emission 

 testing association.

 Try telling that to the Council 

 Service Station or so many other PUC centres in Calcutta 

 doling out pass certificate by the dozens.

 Metro had last Saturday 

 exposed a scam involving false auto emission certificates 

 from PUC centres. A diesel-driven, smoke-belching Tata Sumo 

 was gifted Grade A emission certificates at two PUC centres 

 without the vehicle even being put to test.

 PVD estimates suggest that of 

 10 lakh-plus vehicles in the city, more than two lakh run 

 on diesel, most of which are commercial vehicles, like buses, 

 minibuses, taxis and various goods vehicles. 

 ?The level of maintenance in commercial 

 vehicles is generally poor. If tests are carried out properly, 

 60 per cent of these vehicles will not be able to clear 

 the tests, and that?s why fudging is rampant for diesel-driven 

 vehicles,? said S.M. Ghosh, whose petition on pollution 

 in Calcutta was disposed of last week.

 The fudging fact sheet has an 

 economic by-line as well. ?In most cases, customers refuse 

 to pay up if their vehicles fail to pass the tests,? rued 

 John Mukherjee of Uma Service Station, at Dhakuria.

 To minimise the chances of refusal 

 of payment, around 50 per cent of diesel-driven vehicles 

 are turned away, as they don?t stand a chance of clearing 

 the tests. They then invariably end up in PUC centres where 

 a pass certificate suits both examiner and examinee.

 So, while an Uma Service Station 

 hosts just 86 diesel-driven vehicles a month, a Council 

 Service Station draws 500-plus. 

 ?The difference indicates that 

 vehicle-owners prefer centres where success is assured,? 

 summed up a PVD official.

?Music is my main weapon?

What is Home Delivery all about?

The basic definition of Home Delivery is that 

it is an out-and-out comedy. The whole movie stands on one premise ? when one 

goes through life, he or she meets a lot of people and chooses whether or not 

to learn something from those people. So my story is about this day in the life 

of a columnist when he encounters so many types of people and the kind of experiences 

he goes through. It?s a comedy all the way because that?s what I am comfortable 

with.

Why such a title?

That I can?t reveal to you at this stage. But one 

of the reasons definitely is the fact that one of the people he meets happens 

to be a delivery man, played by Boman Irani. There are these five main characters 

in the film. Vivek Oberoi plays the protagonist, Ayesha Takia is his fianc?e, 

Rajpal Yadav is his neighbour, Mahima Chaudhury plays a seasoned but nutty actress 

and Boman the delivery man.

What made you pick Vivek of all people?

I am not in that stage of my career when big actors 

would be eager to work with me. Vivek liked the script and the character and agreed 

to do my film. Beggars cannot be choosers. Ekhon jodi Vivek hothat bole 

korbo na, then I have to look elsewhere. 

As for the role of the actress, I wrote the character 

with Juhi Chawla in mind. Kintu Juhir to puchke puchke duto bachcha achhe 

? so she really can?t give the amount of time the role demands. So I got hold 

of Mahima. But Juhi is doing another small, surprise role in Home Delivery. 

I can?t make a film without Juhi. 

As for Ayesha, I just loved her in Socha Na Tha. 

And Boman and Rajpal are so good, they pick themselves.

And you have 25 songs in the film?

(Laughs). I am not sure whether I can fit in 

so many. Vishal-Shekhar, of course, has done the music. I would definitely try 

and get as many of them as I can. Gada gada gaan achhe. Music is everything 

for me. I try and squeeze in as many as I can without distorting the script. 

See, I have no formal knowledge about cinema. Whatever 

I know is from watching and to me film is like cooking a dish with lots of ingredients. 

You have cinematography, editing, etc as your ingredients and it depends on you 

what you want to bank on. I use music as my main weapon. I love to tell a story 

via music ? it?s a nice challenge. Kolkatay janmale ja hoy ar ki?

That?s worked for you in Jhankaar Beats?

The two main Calcutta connections for Jhankaar 

Beats were a) the RD Burman tribute and b) Juhi Chawla?s character of a typical 

boudi. I was apprehensive whether everyone across the country would be 

able to identify with these concepts and I am happy they have.

Now that it?s all over tell us more about Vivek 

Vaswani stealing your script and making Dil Vil Pyar Vyar?

He wanted to produce my film but wanted a lot of changes 

that I said no to and then he did what he did. These things keep happening here 

in Mumbai. The trick is to not pay any attention to these things. Had he made 

a better film with my script that would have been really shameful.

I was really struggling then. For two years I knocked 

on every door looking for a producer. On the brink of giving up, jokhon haathe 

hurricane, Pritish Nandy agreed to produce. He was in fact the last guy I 

had thought of approaching. Had he said no, I would have been back in the pavilion 

doing my Reuters job, which I had done for eight years before that.

Now it?s all Home Delivery?

Oh yes! I start shooting next month. It is a 50-day 

schedule spread over two-and-a-half months. It will be shot entirely in Mumbai 

? I prefer it that way. It is a co-production of Sahara and Percept Picture Company. 

Home Delivery will be shot by another Bengali ? Sudeep Chatterjee. It will 

be edited by my old editor Suresh Pai or Nikhilbabu Onir.

And plans of a cameo in this one too?

(Laughs). No, no nothing like that. I did that 

role in My Brother? Nikhil because the film was made with a really small 

budget and I had to do it for Onir. He has made such a sensitive film.

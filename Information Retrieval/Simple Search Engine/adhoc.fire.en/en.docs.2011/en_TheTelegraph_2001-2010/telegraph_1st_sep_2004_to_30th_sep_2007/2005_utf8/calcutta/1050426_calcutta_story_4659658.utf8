 Students at war with HIV

 A STAFF REPORTER

 There is no dearth of information on the subject. The real problem is the mental block. 

 ?That?s exactly what we?ll try to clear.? The brave words offered a glimpse into the strong resolve of the students and teachers of Vivekananda Mission School, as they renewed their pledge to fight HIV/AIDS on Monday.

 The school, which believes in going beyond academic excellence for the overall development of students, is promoting the young ones as the ?face? of its HIV/AIDS awareness movement.

 ?There are hospitals where even the doctors hold AIDS patients with gloves for fear of contamination. If the students can touch the patients and sit beside them, it will really help to break some of the stigma,? said Bappaditya Mukherjee, a teacher of the school.

 At a formal occasion scheduled for April 30, an album of HIV/AIDS awareness-related songs will be released. The songs have been composed and sung by teachers and students of the school. The policy of how to go about things will also be formulated.

 ?We then plan to take the project to the rural areas and organise a competition on the awareness among kids there. Through the kids, we can reach the parents more effectively,? feels Mukherjee.

 Besides the current crop of students, the alumni, particularly fresh pass-outs, are also lending a helping hand. ?We will not be counselling AIDS patients because that?s the job of professionals,? is the frank admission from Nazreen Islam, an ex-student who is a part of the drive. ?But holding their hand and talking about the disease is a start,? she offered.

 And none of this will hamper studies, promises principal Keya Sinha. ?Our school has excellent academic record. The awareness programme is part of the students? SUPW project and the activities will be held on Saturdays only,? she said.

 An East Bengal-Mohun Bagan clash has been kicked off, but this time it?s not on the football field. The venue for the face-off is a restaurant where the culinary skills of both sides will be tested. Bengali eatery 6, Ballygunge Place is hosting Foodball, a festival showcasing delicacies from both sides of the Bengal border ? west and erstwhile east.

 ?There is always an argument among the people of two Bengals about food. So we decided to bring together flavours from epar and opar Bangla,? explains chef Sushanta Sengupta.

 The menu is a perfect mix of spicy gravy and sweet somethings. Supporters of the red-and-gold brigade can sample Lau Shukto, Tilpotti, Dhakai Paratha, Kakra Shorshe, Aar Machher Roast, Bhapa Ilish, Doi Ilish, Ilish Paturi and Loithya Shutki.

 On the other hand, maroon-and-green fans Mohun Bagan can drool over Posto Narkel, Posto Bata, Doi Potol, Echorer Kofta Curry, Bagda Chingri Malai Curry, Kakra Galpethechi, Doi Machh, Lal Murgi, Mangsho Birinchi and Kasha Mangsho. 

 To cap off the feast, the range of desserts includes Gokul Pithe, Patisapta, Chhanar Payesh and Pantua. 

 Those interested in taking sides will have to shell out anything between Rs 45 and Rs 295 per item. The festival will be on till May 1.

 ?We have tried to bring back some dishes to our culinary chart that the younger generation is unaware of,? says Aninda Palit, one of the partners of the eatery.

 Eye on Calcutta 

Renu Roy

 If Calcutta remains the culture capital of the country, 

kudos are due to those who provide patronage to the programmes

Art and culture in its multifold manifestations has 

always had patrons. The history of almost all civilisations tells virtually the 

same story, through almost any period of time. There is hardly any reason why 

our own Calcutta should be any different. And it is not.

From the babus of Calcutta during the 19th century 

to the English sahibs of the East India Company and the crown, artistic expression, 

for which our city is so justifiably proud, has been made possible through the 

munificence of patrons and donors.

If one looks at our own times, when corporate backers 

and advertising budgets have taken on these responsibilities, the individual who 

often hides behind the banners, still remains very important. Those who know what 

is happening have no difficulty in identifying who is behind this musical soiree, 

or that painting exhibition, or the next theatre festival.

Among the three names of the younger generation that 

seem to reappear with regularity are Harshvardhan Neotia, Sanjay Budhia and Sanjiv 

Goenka. I do not mention them in any order of importance, nor do I wish to bruise 

any sentiments by leaving out others worthy of mention. But the fact is that they 

have been regular sponsors of cultural and artistic events.

I mention them together because they do have more 

than one element in common. First, they are all successful entrepreneurs in their 

own right. Second, they all come from respected Calcutta Marwari business families. 

Third, they are unabashed supporters and lovers of our much-maligned city. Fourth, 

all three of them are in their mid-40s, in the prime of their professional lives.

There are plenty of other resemblances, but I do not 

wish to go into a tiring litany of similarities. The one major similarity, though, 

that certainly merits mention is the fact that all three of them chose to build 

their careers in Calcutta during the early 80s, when the situation here was neither 

bright nor encouraging.

Though they had the advantage of families that backed 

them up, the choice of their battlefield was their own.

Calcutta, in those days, was certainly not an easy 

place. In fact, everything seemed to be against entrepreneurship. That the business 

situation was grim was the understatement of the decade.

Yet, Sanjiv Goenka chose to return from Hyderabad 

where he was looking towards a welcome future. Sanjay Budhia came in from Tinsukia 

to discover new industrial avenues in Calcutta. Armed with a Harvard degree, Harsh 

Neotia could have settled anywhere in the world, but chose what many others thought 

to be one of the world?s greatest urban disasters.

When established businessmen and houses were leaving 

Calcutta because it could not offer them a bright enough future, these three young 

men set out to discover their future right here. What did they see here that the 

others did not?

The fact that the situation has, to a certain extent 

turned around, and the future is nowhere as bleak as it was two decades ago is 

a matter of history. But the credit that must go to them was that they built successes 

at a time and place which others saw as a sinking ship.

The ship did not sink, and there can be no doubt that 

the examples that the three of them offer, along with scores of others, have contributed 

substantially to the rising expectation and the new upbeat spirit that Calcutta 

is showing today.

Mine is an attempt at evaluation of their spirit, 

not their assets. I see their achievement not in material terms but as profiles 

in courage, who withstood the same storm, at the same time, and emerged victorious.

Their victory counts, because it can inspire others 

to follow and show the path to those who are looking for fresh avenues. Their 

enterprise will certainly take them beyond Calcutta, but their feet, along with 

their hearts, will be firmly planted on the eastern bank of the Hooghly. Otherwise 

they would not have invested so much of their time, their money and efforts to 

develop the art and culture of our city.

That their families did not originate here is something 

that does not bother any of them, because their sense of belonging to the city 

is so strong.

In fact, I am reminded of a tiny bit of the city?s 

history of art patronage. The great 19th century actress Binodini was able to 

build a theatre because of her great admirer Gurmukh Rai, who did not even follow 

the language she acted in. But then, art has its own language, like the heart 

as well.

It is not by chance that Sanjiv Goenka is the consul 

for Canada, Sanjay Budhia for Malaysia, or Harsh Neotia for Israel; it is a measure 

of how strongly the world sees them as Calcuttans. It is no accident that Sanjiv 

Goenka has acquired probably the largest and most valuable collection of contemporary 

Calcutta paintings. It is no surprise that Harsh Neotia was awarded the Padma 

Shri in 1999 for pioneering private involvement in social housing. It is no coincidence 

that Sanjay Budhia?s company is a star exporter.

All these are indicators of the kind of people they 

are. They epitomise Calcutta?s renewed vigour and symbolise the endeavour and 

challenge with which we look ahead.

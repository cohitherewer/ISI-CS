 Booking counters bereft of water

DRY RUN: A ticket-booking counter at Sealdah station. Pictures

Smriti Bhattacharjee: In most of the railway stations 

under the Sealdah South section, and even along the Main line, officials at the 

ticket-booking counters are not getting drinking water in their offices. Are you 

doing something to improve the situation?

 I was not aware of the problem. It is unfortunate that our workers do not have access to drinking water in their offices. However, I feel that this predicament might be a temporary one. I can assure you that I will definitely look into the matter as soon as possible and ask the maintenance department to solve the problem at the earliest.

 The present depression over Orissa is heading towards Madhya Pradesh, but the city and large parts of south Bengal are likely to experience a renewed spurt of showers for more than a month.

 The depression has strengthened the monsoon weeks before its scheduled departure, bringing on rain that the state has missed for the better part of the season and giving rise to the prospect of a wet Puja.

 ?The monsoon has picked up momentum again and more and more moisture-laden winds are moving towards Bengal,? said G.C. Debnath, director of the weather section at the Regional Meteorological Centre, Alipore.

 ?The wind-flow pattern will bring rains in the next few weeks. And the dank weather will continue beyond October 8, the official withdrawal date for the monsoon,? he added. Mahasashthi is on October 9.

 The city was lashed by smart showers for most of Tuesday, causing inconvenience to office-goers and students and upsetting plans of Puja-shoppers.

 The rains also affected traffic. ?Frequent snarls were reported in the morning, but thankfully, there was no waterlogging. The situation improved in the afternoon,? said an officer at Lalbazar police headquarters.

 Officials in the Met department said the depression that caused rainfall in the past three days had crossed the Orissa coast on Monday evening and was hovering over Jharsuguda on Tuesday afternoon.

 By the evening, it was moving in a northwesterly direction, towards Madhya Pradesh.

 Acting deputy director-general at the Regional Meteorological Centre K.K. Chakraborty warned that heavy rains were likely in the city in the next 48 hours.

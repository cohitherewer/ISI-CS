 Fostering artistic talents

 Founded in 1995, the B.D. Bangur Endowment Trust is committed to supporting growth through professional education with a concern for social and human values. Actively involved in promoting and nurturing young talents in the field of the creative arts, the Trust hosts Nirmaan 2004-05, an exhibition of the works of emerging artists and artisans in the field of fashion, photography, textiles and arts. The motley collection of works on show, selected by an eminent jury comprising Raghu Rai, Chittrovanu Mazumdar, Anamika Khanna, Paresh Maity and Rakesh Thakore, is truly representative of the genre and the generation to which they belong. Though original in design and application, the works are inspired by tradition and clearly reveal the artists? desire to connect with and appropriate the glorious culture and heritage of the past. Aimed towards creating opportunities for creative and artistic expression, the exhibition also provides a platform to those aspiring for a career in the field of the arts by organising an informative, interactive session of the participants with industry experts. Inauguration by Shabana Azmi.

Delayed release: Frozen moments from Finding 

Neverland and The Aviator 

Shiloo Chattopadhyay writes fine, and I read his Ad 

Lib minutely. He did a great job by going against the tide on February 6 (Premium 

at prime time). 

 When the Book Fair was organised for the first time, way back in 1976, I was a first-year student hailing from the suburbs, studying in a Bowbazar commerce college. The Fair came to me like a gust of fresh wind, or a lingering French perfume. I saw a lot of books, about which I had only heard earlier. At that adolescent age, I spent a lot of time there, not minding SPM (suspended particulate matter) in air, as pollution awareness was very low then. 

 Just like the characters in Chattopadhyay?s feature, I, too, now, feel a passion to be there on the Fair grounds, but cannot gather enough courage, seeing the frenzied crowd. Some crowd control measures are absolutely necessary if the Fair intends to be relevant. 

 The entry fee to the Book Fair should be increased at least fifty-fold, and the cost be made recoverable against purchase of books; and apart from it, a minimum educational qualification, say Honours graduate or equivalent, should be stipulated for post-30 visitors. 

 Unless some unpopular and harsh measures are taken, the Fair will continue to be a traffic-jammer spoilsport, a carnival of the subalterns. 

Tapan Pal,

Batanagar. 

I completely agree with the report ?Hollywood denied?, February 8. With the advent of multiplexes in Calcutta, theatres that used to show Hollywood films are now showing Hindi movies instead. Unfortunately, English films are not shown at convenient times in any of the three multiplexes in the city. I have been a Hollywood buff for the past five decades. In the past one year, I have failed to catch the majority of the releases from Hollywood for this reason. Calcutta once had 14 theatres which regularly showed English films. It is sad that they are being sidelined now. 

Mohun Roy, 

Bansdroni.

Elderly people fondly recollect watching Hollywood 

blockbusters along with the rest of the world. Two Women, Hunchback 

of Notre Dame and That Splendid November are some films that come to 

mind as having wordwide premiere here. Metro, Lighthouse, Globe, Elite and New 

Empire are the halls where these films used to be shown, with long queues outside. 

It is sad how the situation has changed. 

Debaprasad Mukherjee,

Nayapatty Road. 

Apropos the report ?30 zones in city too noisy?, February 9, it is distressing to note that the decibel level has reached alarming proportions at 30 spots in the city. As noise can cause various types of health hazards, steps should be taken to keep the sound level to a minimum. Use of loud horns should be banned, especially near schools and hospitals. Moreover, old and defective vehicles causing loud noise should not be allowed to ply. 

Piyal Mukherjee, 

Lake Town.

Students often get disturbed by loud horns and blaring 

loudspeakers while attending classes. Many schools and colleges are situated in 

the 30 areas that have been found to be too noisy. Spot fines by the traffic police 

and a blanket ban on making noise in sensitive areas should have the desired effect. 

Frequent awareness campaigns are also needed. 

Bhupen Bose, 

Dum Dum Park.

 There was a war of words between Calcutta Municipal Corporation and Publishers and Booksellers Guild over the clearance of garbage from the Book Fair grounds (Guild wins time for fair clean-up, February 11). The matter should have been settled before the fair was organised. But since it wasn?t, the authorities should remove the garbage before starting discussions on the issue. 

Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

Behala. 

The Guild, which so efficiently organises the Book 

Fair every year, seems to be a failure when it comes to clearing the garbage that 

the fair leaves behind (Time plea to clear fair mess mounds, February 10). The 

situation has been the same for the last 30 years and it is the Maidan green cover 

that is suffering. 

Sunil Banerjee,

VIP Road. 

 The photograph showing a heron and a nilgai having a heart-to-heart at the Alipore zoo (The City Diary, February 15) was wonderful. Crows and herons are very useful to animals. They eat harmful insects inside the ears of animals and from other parts of their body. 

Prahlad Agarwala,

Majdia, Nadia. 

It was with sadness that I read three reports on February 10, ?East West trip takes a U-turn?, ?State to toe court road fix order? and ?Those monsters of the road?. Recently, I was in Mumbai and saw how development work is handled there. The constant squabble between our mayor and the state government is stalling road repairs. Our leaders can learn from their Mumbai counterparts how to keep politics out of work. 

Kalyan Ghosh,

Park Street. 

In Hong Kong, Victoria and Kowloon Islands are connected 

by a number of under-sea roads and tube rails. We hoped to get at least a Metro 

link in Calcutta, from Salt Lake to Daspara in Howrah, passing under the Hooghly. 

Will at least a truncated version of the project, from Salt Lake to Writers? Buildings, 

get the green signal? 

A.K. Ghosh,

CIT Road. 

The article ?Trendy troika for all-night chill? (February 2) reveals the changing face of Calcutta. Comparisons have started between the nightlife of the city and that of Delhi and Mumbai, but have people ever looked at the disparities in purchasing powers? 

Gunjeet Wadhwa,

Rai Bahadur Road.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 STAR-struck

 A moment with the Big B from KBC 2 on STAR Plus

STAR Plus is still firmly on top, STAR News and STAR Ananda have just reached there, STAR One has proved critics wrong with great ratings, and all eyes are on STAR?s upcoming direct-to-home service.

 Peter Mukerjea should be a happy man. ?But as my school report card said, you can always do better,? smiled the CEO of the most successful broadcaster in India, during a brief visit to Calcutta on Thursday.

 KBC 2 has allayed fears that the second outing would not match the first round success. But since its introduction, the weekend programming has seen a jump of ?200 per cent? in audience share. ?The advertising community was apprehensive about the second run. Now, those who didn?t come on board are regretting it,? Mukerjea said.

 STAR One, the group?s other Hindi entertainment offering, is also picking up. ?It?s doing phenomenally well, given the fact that it was considered niche at the time of the launch, and the programme it broke big with,? offered Mukerjea, about the channel which turns a year old next month.

 The Great Indian Laughter Challenge helped STAR One break into the top 30 programmes list. ?We?ve had lots of comedy shows over the years, but not a competition like this? Stand-up comedy has long been neglected on television.?

 The next big thing on STAR One continues with the innovative streak. Nach Baliye is a dance competition where small-screen celebrity couples battle for the top honour. ?We are confident of the programme and are putting a lot into it. The idea is to establish STAR One as the number two entertainment channel in India.?

 The next big thing from the group, of course, is T-Sky, the DTH venture in partnership with the Tatas. ?We?re looking at launching the service in early 2006,? revealed Mukerjea.

 ?In the present scenario, broadcasters get paid for one-sixth of the number of cable and satellite homes and the consumer has no choice.? The DTH service, according to Mukerjea, has the ?catalytic capacity to change the distribution system?.

 But is conditional access system history, then? ?No, the two can co-exist. In fact, we are encouraging multi-system operators to introduce addressable systems on their own through set-top boxes.?

 The wireless and mobile segment is also in focus for STAR, as it draws up plans to offer content over the mobile phone in ?the next 12 months?.

 One apology calls for another in return.

 The Jadavpur University campus may have calmed down on Thursday following a settlement between the agitating students and the teachers? team late on Wednesday, but a fresh agitation is brewing behind the serene scenes.

 Unless the administration provides ?a satisfactory explanation? for the June 10 police crackdown by next week, the faculty of engineering and technology students? union (Fetsu) is threatening unrest, once more.

 This time, however, the movement will take a different, more peaceful form, sans boycotts, Fetsu leaders hastened to assure.

 The issue of forcible eviction of and alleged assault on a group of fasting students by policemen on June 10 was raised at Wednesday?s discussions between Fetsu and the negotiators.

 But only the main problems at hand ? the suspension order of five students and the Fetsu going on record expressing regret for the 2003 campus violence ? were settled.

 Despite student demands, the five-member team refused to hold a discussion on the police action.

 During the first three hours of the marathon meeting on Wednesday, Fetsu representatives insisted the inquiry team consider the June 10 incident as a separate issue of discussion, demanding the panel come out with a statement on why the cops were called in to evict fasting students.

 But the probe team insisted that its job was only to figure out how to restore peace and normalcy on the campus.

 Later, the committee agreed to recommend that the vice-chancellor issue an explanatory statement after July 4, when the varsity?s executive council would ratify the resolutions adopted on Wednesday.

 ?It was shocking the way the team avoided any discussion on the June 10 incident,? Amit Chakraborty, a Fetsu leader, said on Thursday.

 ?We may have to take our movement forward if the authorities do not consider the committee?s recommendation,? he stressed.

 By then, students would have rejoined classes and appeared for examinations. So, protests against the June 10 action would continue in the form of meetings, rallies and posters.

 ?We are hopeful the vice-chancellor will consider our recommendation to give a statement on the incident, as demanded by the students,? said Manoj Mitra, dean, faculty of engineering and technology and chairman of the five-member committee.

 The varsity authorities on Thursday started preparations to reschedule the semester examinations. Students had boycotted them twice as part of their movement.

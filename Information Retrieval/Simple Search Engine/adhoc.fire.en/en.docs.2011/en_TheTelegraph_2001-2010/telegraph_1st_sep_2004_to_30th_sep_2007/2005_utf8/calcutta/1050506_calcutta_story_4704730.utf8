 The reality show

 Abuse ? real-life or absurdist, physical or educational ? formed the concern of two recent productions in town. In Bitter Chocolate by Theatre World (Delhi), organised by Open Doors at Tollygunge Club, Arvind Gaur dramatises six cases of child sexual abuse documented by Pinki Virani in her book of the same title. The ?play? reopens an old question: how can life be best converted into art, if at all? Virani?s horrifying case histories make one retch; any attempt to aestheticise them may seem like unjustifiably sugarcoating an unpalatably bitter pill.

 Not that Lushin Dubey?s solo performance does not have art, but it is distinctly secondary, and it pales before its subject. She metamorphoses into 16 characters (victims, abusers, parents, policemen, doctors, lawyers) to relate half-a-dozen true stories, and does so with everything in her armoury ? bilingual fluency, a wide vocal range, quick-change costumes and facial expressions. But Gaur?s direction of the switchovers disappoints.

 Ultimately we must also ask, what next? We must go beyond acting into action ? which is not the domain of art. In this context, one may speculate which course of artistic activism translates into more effective social action: Gaur?s docudramatic consciousness-raising, or an in-depth analytical probing of a single fictitious situation on the same topic (the kind Mahesh Dattani does so well). No doubt both have their place.

 Actually, the greatest artists make symbols act more potently than reality. This was proved yet again by Ionesco?s The Lesson, staged by Theatrecian. One of the founding fathers of absurdist drama, Ionesco transformed the ubiquitous tutor-pupil relationship into a simultaneous indictment of sexual abuse, the educational system, generational tyranny and power play ? all through macabre humour. This was even before Beckett?s Godot, in 1950.

 While a maid drifts in and out, the old professor slowly domineers over and finally assaults and kills his young tutee who, we eventually discover, is his 40th victim. Anyone who sees this play can connect it to the daily academic slaughter in our country in the name of learning. Indeed, the youngest kids in the audience loved every minute of the surface farce. 

 By couching it explicitly as a murder thriller, with visual and aural echoes of Psycho, director Bobby Chakraborty oversimplifies teachers? exploitation of their hypnotic hold over students.

 What saves the show is the strength of Ionesco?s text on the one hand and the effortless acting of Ronjini Chakraborty as the innocent teenager. She captures very naturally the girl?s gawkishness and disinterest in studies, as well as her sudden toothache from having to learn so many new things. 

 Bobby Chakraborty himself is not as good because, by playing a Dracula from the start, he disobeys Ionesco?s instructions about the professor growing from a meek demeanour to a violent assassin. He does not allow the constantly ashen-faced spectral Anoorupa Bose (the maid) to develop either. 

 Speaking of murder mysteries, Harin Mehta?s Kohara by Nath Theatre (Mumbai) in Hindi had as many as four shows here. It lived up to its billing as a ?suspense comedy?, since it bored its audiences into suspended comas for three hours every evening. Nothing happens apart from Rohini Hattangady, as a nurse, and a mysterious man in black crossing each other?s paths with excessive regularity as bodies drop dead with less regularity. It had no direction literally, because it had no director (I searched the credits).

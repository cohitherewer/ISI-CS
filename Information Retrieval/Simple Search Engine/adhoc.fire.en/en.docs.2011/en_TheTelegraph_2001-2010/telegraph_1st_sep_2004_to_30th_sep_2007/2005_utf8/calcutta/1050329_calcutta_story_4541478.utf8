 Test radiation risk for young women

 - Mammography, useless under age 40, prescribed rampantly

 Sunayana Arora is barely 16 and Anita Mitra 23, but both have undergone multiple mammograms, not knowing that at their age, this test, which also exposed them to radiation, is useless.

 Young women across the city continue to undergo mammograms for suspected breast lumps, on the advice of their doctors. A mammogram is an X-ray of the breast in which the tissue is compressed to give images of tumours that cannot otherwise be detected. 

 The test is effective only for people above 40, due to changes in muscle density with age.

 ?Mammograms are routinely prescribed by doctors in Calcutta for young women,? said R.N. Sain, chief radiologist, Belle Vue. ?Not only do they not work, but frequent exposure to radiation can affect other body parts, including the ovum,? he warns.

 ?Young breast tissue is condensed, so a mammogram is of no use before the age of 40 years,? said radiotherapist Subir Gangopadhyay.

 Surgical gastroenterologist Sanjay De Bakshi has treated a 16-year-old girl who has had two mammograms. ?I tried to tell her that simple pain need not mean breast cancer,? said De Bakshi.

 Every year, 1,500 new breast cancer cases are reported in Calcutta. Around 70 per cent of them have had multiple mammograms. Doctors say 90 per cent of such patients are diagnosed with non-malignant fibro cysts.

 Almost all city hospitals and clinics offer mammography. The test can cost between Rs 1,100 and Rs 2,000. An estimated 1,700 women have mammograms every year, of whom 55 per cent are below 35 years.

 Rajeev Agarwal, consultant gynaecologist at Wockhardt Hospital and Kidney Institute, has seen 35 patients in the past few weeks who, despite two or three mammograms, believe they could have breast cancer. 

 ?Medical norms are completely violated in the city. Instead of promoting breast self-examination, doctors prescribe mammography for women below 40,? stresses Agarwal.

 ?Young women should explore all other possibilities before investigating for cancer,? advised cancer surgeon Gautam Mukhopadhyay.

 Doctors say that breast pain in women below 35 is often pre-menstrual soreness. Also, cysts that are not malignant can be detected through an ultrasound. The first step, before rushing to an X-ray clinic, is to conduct a self-examination at home.

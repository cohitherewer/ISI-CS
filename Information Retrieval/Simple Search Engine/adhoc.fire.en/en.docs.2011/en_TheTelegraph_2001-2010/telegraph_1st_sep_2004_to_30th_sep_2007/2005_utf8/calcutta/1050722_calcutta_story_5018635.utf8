The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Court rap on rescue home 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court has asked the state government to file an affidavit stating what steps it had taken to check inmates from fleeing Liluah Rescue Home, in Howrah, at regular intervals.

 ?We are deeply concerned over the escape of Saraswati Sarkar from the rescue home and expect the government to show what steps it has taken for the protection of the inmates,? the division bench of Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice A.K. Ganguly said in an order last week, a copy of which was made available to Metro on Thursday. 

 The court has asked the government to file the affidavit within four weeks.

 The order followed a petition by advocate Tapas Bhanja seeking the court?s intervention into the frequent incidents of inmates escaping from the home.

 ?We are not at all satisfied with the report of the inspection committee regarding the healthcare of the inmates. It seems that the doctor is still not residing in the quarters and the healthcare of the inmates rests upon an assistant-cum-pharmacist. The government will have to take steps in this regard,? the court order added.

 The bench asserted the need to separate the administrative area on the home?s premises from the residence of the inmates. It has also asked the government to fill up the vacant posts in the home?s administration.

 The court turned down Bhanja?s plea to allow him to visit the home and file a report before it on the current situation. The case will come up for hearing again in mid-August.

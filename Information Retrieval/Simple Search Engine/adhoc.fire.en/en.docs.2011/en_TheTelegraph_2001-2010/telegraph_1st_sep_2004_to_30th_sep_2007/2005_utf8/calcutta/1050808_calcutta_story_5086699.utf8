 War of words on security

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Two senior CPM functionaries on Sunday crossed swords at a convention over the role of police in Salt Lake. 

 While state finance minister Asim Dasgupta urged police to keep vigil on ?outsiders? and labourers working in buildings under construction and intensify security at the entry points of the township, local CPM member of Parliament Amitabha Nandy opposed the idea, saying manning entry points was not the solution. 

 Nandy flayed the VVIPs of Salt Lake, Dasgupta being one of them, for ?making the whole police department run even if a towel is stolen?. 

 In the presence of North 24-Parganas police superintendent Praveen Kumar, Nandy accused a section of police of taking bribes. ?I do not understand the idea of closing the entry points of Salt Lake after every incident. This is not the solution,? he said. 

 ?It is not fair to say now that I have constructed my house without hassle, I will harass those who are constructing theirs. Labourers will come from outside and people will build houses on vacant land,? Nandy thundered.

 ?Some policemen are not discharging their social responsibilities. The police chief must take note of this,? the MP demanded.

 ?Today, I have received complaints of innocent people being arrested. I have received reports that police take money and set them free,? he continued. ?We shall stage demonstrations in front of the police stations to protest harassment.?

 ?No taxi likes to visit Salt Lake because of this reason? I call upon the SP to take steps against these irregularities and improve the image of police,? Nandy added.

 Reacting to the MP?s allegations, Kumar said he would take actions after getting specific complaints.

 On the issue of VVIP security, Nandy commented: ?Security is also required for businessmen, political party workers and others. Security should be provided in accordance with the threat perception of a person and not to satisfy his ego.?

 Dasgupta, in his speech, expressed reservations about the number of security personnel provided to VVIPs. ?I do not need so many securitymen. My security should be the bare minimum,? he held. 

 Dasgupta asserted that construction of buildings should be stopped if the owners do not provide the authorities a list of labourers working at the site.

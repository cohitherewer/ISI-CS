 Film shows in your palm

 - 15,000 songs, 150 hours on view: the video iPod is here

 The video iPod, which its maker calls an evolution of the revolution

 Music then, video now. It all started with a tiny device that fit into the palm and played mind-blowing music. Several size shrinks and feature upgrades later, the video iPod has now come calling.

 The latest incarnation of the Apple iPod, ?the world?s most popular portable music player?, plays hours of video, viewable on the player?s screen as well as through the television.

 The product was released in the US this October, but it?s only just trickling into select shelves around town.

 ?We have been receiving a number of requests ever since its launch, but the shipment has just started arriving,? said Deven Shah of Rahul Commerce, an Apple reseller in the city.

 Sanjay Chordia of Systematix Media, another dealer, added: ?After the super success of iPod Nano (that reached the city this October), the video model has seen a decent initial response.?

 Chordia has already sold over 25 pieces of the video variety, which retails for around Rs 22,000 (30 GB model) and Rs 29,000 (60 GB model), and comes in two colours ? black and white.

 But Apple doesn?t call it the video iPod. Instead, for the company known for its innovative designs, it?s an ?evolution of the revolution? ? from songs to photos to podcasts (a kind of ?radio show? that can be stored and listened to later on the iPod), and now, to video.

 The new iPod is ?45 per cent? slimmer than the original model, weighs around 150 g and manages to store 15,000 songs or 25,000 photos or 150 hours of video.

 One can watch movies, music videos and more on the super-crisp, 2.5-inch screen or by connecting the iPod to a television set through a standard TV-out cable.

 The only downside is that while those in the US can download from over ?2,000 music videos? (for $1.99 each), watch Pixar animated short films or access the latest episodes of Desperate Housewives and Lost a day after they are aired, that option is not available in India.

 ?You can, however, watch movies or home videos by copying them on to the device from VCDs and DVDs,? suggested Chordia.

 But the process ? involving use of converting software ? being new and a trifle complicated could prove to be a hi-tech hurdle for buyers, felt Shah. ?Unlike the Nano, which has found mass appeal, the video model for the moment is restricted to tech enthusiasts and the yuppy upwardly mobile crowd. But it?s sure to get more popular,? Shah observed.

 The other problem, of course, is the ever-growing grey market. ?The import duty and high sales tax in the state make a significant difference in price between the grey and white markets,? rued a dealer.

 Flavours of friendship

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 Rani Mukherjee and Abhishek Bachchan recreate Sholays Yeh dosti... moment in Bunty Aur Babli 

 Purani jeans aur guitar,

 Mohalle ki woh chaat 

 Aur mere yaar

 Ali Haider made his way into the hearts of hundreds of music lovers with this number celebrating the spirit of friendship. The song takes you back to your college campus, refreshing memories of good old days spent in the company of best friends.

 If Haiders hit is not enough, this Friendship Day ? August 7 ? DJs are digging out all-time favourite friendship tunes at city nightclubs to take you on a trip down memory lane.

 So even as you exchange wristbands and gifts to celebrate the occasion, make sure to drop in at the nightspots with your buddies and get into the groove.

 Goodlife listens in to some of the tracks that city DJs will be spinning this Friendship Day.

 Talk of friendship and one reel moment ingrained in the minds of viewers is that of Jai (Amitabh Bachchan) and Veeru (Dharmendra) mounted on a bike, singing Yeh dosti hum nahin todenge. A rage in the mid-70s, the song has never lost its appeal. 

 The movie was an all-time hit and the songs are popular even today, says DJ Akash of Fusion. They were partners in crime and best of pals. The song and its visuals stand for the everlasting values of friendship, he adds.

 DJ Girish of Shisha, too, expects the song to drag friendly feet to the floor this weekend. I have my own remix of this popular track from Sholay, but I keep it for selective audiences only so that it doesnt lose its charm. This Friendship Day, I am going to up the tempo with Yeh dosti.

 i Haiders Purani Jeans is also on the favourites-list of the turntablers. More so since it captures the essence of college days ? the excitement of bunking classes, the first secret puff or the first brush with love. The song scores primarily on the simplicity of the lyrics. These are words and feelings the youth identifies with, says DJ Akash. The original song might not be peppy enough for the party people to groove to, but the DJs ensure that their remixed versions provide ample scope for that.

 If you fell in love with your closest friend in school, the next song has to be the first on your favourite list. Pehla nasha from Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar was a rage in the early 90s, even as Aamir Khan and his gang became idols of friendship. 

 The dance sequence and the freshness of the song had everybody drooling, says DJ Lloyd of B.E.D (Bars Entertainment and Dining). 

 DJ Girish rates the remix of Pal, sung by Indian Idol finalists, high on the friendship playlist. The song carries a unique message. The participants were competing against each other, yet the bonhomie among them was evident. Moreover, the song itself speaks about the virtues of a true friend, he feels. Yet another song expected to be a hit on the occasion is Yaron dosti badi hi haseen hai from the soundtrack of Rockford.

 So, as you set out to party this weekend, get ready to be greeted by the sounds of friendship along with the staple Its the time to disco, Chal baliye or Dhadak dhadak.

 Subsidy sop to egg farms

 - Government targets investors in medium-sized units 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcuttans want more eggs on their plates. And to meet that demand, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s government has decided to offer sops to encourage egg farming in the state.

 ?We will offer 10 per cent subsidy on the capital invested in medium-sized egg farms. The finance department has recently cleared our proposal,? animal resources development minister Anisur Rahaman said on Sunday.

 Only medium-sized farms, which keep around 10,000 birds on an average, will be eligible for the subsidy, officials stated.

 According to animal resources department secretary Subesh Das: ?The idea is to encourage investment in the egg farms. Broilers are in plenty but egg production is what the state is increasingly deficient in. We hope to address the situation through this subsidy.?

 The city consumes over six million eggs every day ? over half of the state?s daily consumption. However, egg production rose by only 2.6 per cent between 2003 and 2004, with an annual per capita availability of 35 eggs. 

 To make up for the shortfall, about six million eggs are brought in daily from Andhra Pradesh, the country?s largest egg producer.

 ?More than 60 per cent of the egg farming in our state is done in the unorganised sector. We want to encourage entrepreneurs to start medium-sized egg farms. Once the infrastructure in the farms are in place, we will provide assistance in procuring chicks and feed,? explained an animal resources department official.

 The poultry industry has welcomed the move. 

 ?As the subsidy is for medium-sized farms, serious players will venture in,? said S.S. Agarwal, secretary, East India Association of Poultry Industry and Farmers.

 ?However, easy bank loans are another requisite. The government?s strategy will click if the farms include a chicken feed-processing unit as well,? he pointed out.

 Industry insiders said the lengthy investment cycle was the primary reason for the lack of interest of entrepreneurs in egg farming.

 ?A broiler grows to its full size in six weeks on an investment of just Rs 45 a bird. On the other hand, it takes six months to raise a chick and another 12 months for egg-laying,? said an insider. 

 ?The returns start coming in only then. The investment is also higher ? Rs 100 on a bird, which lays only about 300 eggs in its lifetime. Banks are, therefore, averse to funding such business,? he signed off.

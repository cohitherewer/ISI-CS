 Dance envoys to Dragon Land

 During her Class XII board exams in March, Sunanda Hiroo studied, wrote her exams, studied some more and then danced the night away. Not at a nightclub, but at dance class, in preparation for the Beat Busters troupe?s international debut in China. 

 She was one of 30 young dancers, mostly school and college students, who took the first step towards a Calcutta troupe making a mark abroad. 

 Working hard is something they are familiar with. The month-long rehearsals sometimes stretched all night, as they geared up for the performance organised by the P amp;C Group in China. 

 The company organises an annual event to showcase Indian culture in China. Previous participants include Shiamak Davar?s dancers. This time, it was Beat Busters, a dance troupe formed by Soujit Das, a former instructor of Padatik. Joining them were five musicians from the city, with tabla, flute, sitar and harmonium.

 ?It was an amazing experience,? is the instant reaction from most members of the group. ?The responses from the audiences were the best part. They often joined us on stage, following our steps. They took our autographs and photographs, too. We were almost like celebrities,? laughs 19-year-old Shreya Dey.

 The two-hour show was divided into four parts. ?First was contemporary dance, with Indian and Chinese music. Then was an Indian-style dance drama. The third part was meant to showcase modern Western styles prevalent in India. The last part was the most popular ? an Indian wedding,? explains Das, who choreographed the performance mostly to Bollywood music.

 ?Raj Kapoor and Shah Rukh Khan are the most popular Indian actors in China,? says Mohit Agarwal. Although the Bhawanipur College student had some trouble with the food, being a vegetarian, the experience was unforgettable. ?In the city of Maotai, we were told that we were the first foreign visitors. So, during our stay there, we had police escorts.?

 The run-up to the 10-day tour last month was a hectic schedule, with costume fittings (some of the materials came from Mumbai, but the tailoring was done in Calcutta) and late-night rehearsals ? the only time when every one could be together. ?I had a carpool, dropping everyone off, some times early in the morning,? recalls Das. 

 Communication was a problem, with dumb charades being the only means to overcome the language barrier. However, that didn?t stop the group from cashing in on the shopping. ?But we were always conscious that we were representing our country. And that made us very proud,? adds instructor Jeet.

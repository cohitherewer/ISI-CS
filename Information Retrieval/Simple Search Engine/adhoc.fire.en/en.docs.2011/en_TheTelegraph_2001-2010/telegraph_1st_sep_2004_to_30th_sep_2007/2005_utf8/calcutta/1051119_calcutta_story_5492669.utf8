 Backache ails city women

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 Ever wondered why mostly middle-aged women feature in advertisements of pain-relief rubs on television? A survey by the Union health ministry seems to have the answer.

 A just-concluded survey by the ministry has revealed that women, especially in the 30-plus age group, in cities like Mumbai and Delhi, are increasingly falling prey to chronic back disorders. The survey was conducted in collaboration with agencies like the gynaecological society and the community medicine department.

 Statistics gathered over several months show that chronic backache has emerged as the single-largest ailment among women, followed by common problems like lower abdominal pain and menstrual disorders.

 ?Today?s woman is more vulnerable to chronic back disorders as she has to cope with a lot more physical and emotional stress. This is evident from the multifarious roles she performs as a working woman, a wife and mother. That she doesn?t give time for herself is now taking a toll on her health,? said orthopaedic surgeon Buddhadeb Chatterjee.

 Researchers have found that 10.4 per cent of middle-aged women in Calcutta are reporting at the doctor?s with backaches, while about 8.3 per cent are complaining of lower abdominal pain and 5.1 per cent of menstrual problems. Even in the 15 to 19 age bracket, 6.6 per cent girls have backache and 7.6 per cent suffer from lower abdominal pain.

 Apart from extreme stress, doctors said that low calcium intake, pelvic inflammatory diseases, lesions in the cervical area, and wrong exercises and postures, were all contributing to the rising incidence of back disorders.

 ?Seemingly simple work, like lifting heavy objects in a front-bending posture, and lack of correct exercises are at the root of backaches. Sadly, most women ignore these points,? explained gynaecologist B.D. Mukherjee.

 ?In case of lack of adequate calcium intake, the body tries to replenish the element by absorbing it from the bones. Chronic backache is an initial symptom of bone erosion. It may even lead to osteoporosis,? warned Chatterjee.

 Style stop shop

 Model Sanaya Mehta gets a brighter look from stylist Sujata Assomull at Be: Picture by Pabitra Das 

 Sporty, sexy, casual or corporate ? just a few of the many types of looks that are a reflection of a woman?s personality and mood. There is a style for every occasion, but the inner individual is just as important for the outer look, to carry the clothes with the right attitude. 

 Not always, however, do shoppers know what will suit them. In a unique effort to educate people about what to shop for and why, Be:, the pr?t chain of stores under the Raymonds banner, held a two-day session called Be: Transformed at its flagship store in Forum.

 Seven women from various walks of life were randomly picked for an hour-long makeover. It began with a personality test to determine the kind of clothes that would suit her, followed by physical measurements to determine her body type. 

 ?We asked each person to tick a set of adjectives describing the kind of person she is and the kind of look she wants,? says Mumbai-based stylist Sujata Assomull, who assisted the women at Be: in their transformation. 

 Depending on whether the woman in question wanted a sporty, elegant, corporate, party or casual look, the stylist helped her pick clothes from Be:?s collection. Accessories and make-up by Prabir De summed up the session.

 New-look in place, the women took home useful tips from the stylist and make-up artiste.

 ?We?ve been to other cities, but Calcutta women seem to have a very distinct sense of style,? says Sujata.

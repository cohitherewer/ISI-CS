 - HOSPITALS RECAST EMERGENCY INTERVENTION

 A STAFF REPORTER

 GOLDEN HOUR GONE: In recent times, an ambulance trapped in a traffic jam. Hospitals are devising strategies to take healthcare to the homes of critical patients as early as possible. A Telegraph picture 

 Caught in a traffic jam while carrying a critically-ill patient to hospital, how often have you wished that a doctor was beside you? Or have longed for a ventilator? 

 What will happen if your neighbour suffers a massive cardiac arrest and the nearest hospital is at quite a distance?

 If you are groping for an answer, give yourself a few more weeks.

 In a desperate bid to recast the notion of emergency intervention, a cluster of private hospitals in the city has decided to launch a service, bringing emergency healthcare, including the facilities of an intensive care unit, to one?s doorstep.

 An ambulance, equipped with all facilities, will reach the patient?s home and immediately start ?emergency intervention? in the presence of a doctor. And this, within minutes of a call.

 ?Flipping through records of death due to lack of immediate care, we had realised the urgency of putting in place a system that would cut down the wait during the ?golden hour? ? when an emergency patient must be subjected to treatment ? and save lives. This is a proven theory and we want to replicate it in Calcutta,? said Brigadier S.B. Purakayastha of AMRI Hospitals.

 AMRI, for instance, is set to roll out an ambulance ? worth Rs 27 lakh and fitted with all modern gadgets, including a ventilator ? to take care of respiratory failures. The air-conditioned ambulance will also carry a doctor and a nurse. 

 Even the driver will be trained to intervene in an emergency. Among other things, the ambulance will have a pulse oxy-meter to monitor the oxygen-saturation level, a defibrillator to accelerate cardiac rhythms, a syringe pump for slow and micro dose of life-saving drugs. 

 Apollo Hospitals has decided to go a step ahead. Keen to cut down on the ?intervention time? even further, the authorities will soon launch emergency services on motorcycles. 

 ?A doctor will reach the patient in a flash and recommend steps towards medical intervention. Accordingly, a well-equipped team will follow,? said a medical officer of the hospital. 

 ?Saving lives during the crucial intervention time remains one of the major concerns for a developing state and we cannot be an exception. The healthcare scenario around the world is changing fast and our efforts are being reoriented accordingly to reach out as early as possible,? said Major Amit De, chief executive officer of CMRI.

An opportunity to drape a Bollywood star might be a dream-come-true for many aspiring fashion designers. But one city designer has got a rare break even before her career has taken off. 

 Meet Ruth Alison Narjinari ? one of the two representatives from Calcutta at Lakm? Fashion House, the fashion reality show on Star One ? who is all set to drape Kareena Kapoor in one of her creations.

 The 16 finalists, shortlisted from all over the country, are being set various fashion-related tasks throughout the seven-week show that started on February 2. And the second task the team was assigned was to design an outfit for Kareena.

 ?We weren?t given any theme for this. Everything from the look and inspiration to the colour and fabric was left to us,? Ruth told Goodlife from Mumbai. And her creation caught the star?s attention immediately. So much so that Kareena has, apparently, offered to buy the outfit for Rs 5,000.

 ?Kareena is not an ordinary woman, she is a star and so it is very special. And I find her very beautiful. I felt her beauty needs to be preserved and so I used mummification as my inspiration while designing the outfit for her,? explained the former student of Wigan and Leigh College. 

 The fabrics used to make the evening gown are butter crepe and glass nylon and the palette has been restricted to off-white only. The fabrics have been cut in long strips and then stitched together to give a ?bandage like effect?. 

 ?Kareena really liked my outfit and she was very encouraging. She asked me to make the garment in her size and offered to pay Rs 5,000 for it,? squealed Ruth.

 The Kareena affair was, however, just the icing on the cake. Ruth has been enjoying every moment of her stint with the show. The team was taken on a Mumbai darshan on Day 2 and the first task required the participants to make an outfit based on inspirations drawn from people and life in Mumbai. ?It?s been a great experience. We are getting to meet lots of celebrities and learning many new things, even from the other participants. We are working very hard and partying harder!?

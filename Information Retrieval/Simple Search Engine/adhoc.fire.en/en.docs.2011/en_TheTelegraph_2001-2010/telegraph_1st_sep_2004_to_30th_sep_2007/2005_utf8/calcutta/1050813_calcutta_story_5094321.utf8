 DEBAR DIKTAT: No more chill-outs in school uniform. A Telegraph picture

 Next time you decide to bunk classes and head for the nearest mall, chances are you will be stopped at the gate.

 For, the latest hangout addresses in the city are keeping a strict vigil on students in uniform out to have some fun. The slam-door strategy has been in place much before the glare turned on the city?s biggest mall, where school students harassed actress June and telefilm director Anindita Sarbadhicary on Saturday evening.

 Let?s start at City Centre, a hugely popular youth destination. ?There are quite a few schools in Salt Lake. A few months ago, the principal of a prominent school called on us to discuss the problem of students hanging out at the mall during the day,? says Vineet Verma, CEO of City Centre. ?Even before she entered my office, she spotted a group of students from her school loitering around? Some other schools here, too, raised the same issue.?

 Following this, security personnel at the Salt Lake mall have been told to question any student spotted in school dress. ?If they prove that their parents or a teacher of their school is accompanying them, we allow them to stay on, otherwise they are requested to leave,? says Verma.

 It?s no different at Forum. ?Till afternoon, no student in school uniform is allowed to enter the mall. After that, we use our experience and judgment. The seniors are allowed in, but we still do not allow students from junior and middle school,? says a spokesperson for Forum.

 Though the two-year-old Elgin Road mall has adopted this policy for just a couple of months now, INOX, the multiplex on the top floor, has been following the school dress code since moving in in October 2003.

 ?Kids in their school uniforms and without their parents are not allowed inside the auditoriums. This policy prevails in all INOX multiplexes of the country,? says Vikas Syal, general manager, INOX, Forum.

 The debar diktat is much the same at rival 89 Cinemas. ?The morning shows in our multiplex can really do very well if we allow in students who bunk classes. But we do not allow in students in uniform till the afternoon shows,? says Prashant Shrivastav, general manager of the Swabhumi multiplex.

 The no-uniform-please policy has reached another teen spot ? the bookstore. ?A few days ago, a couple of students from a neighbouring school were caught shoplifting in uniform. We approached the school authorities and they suggested we discourage children from entering the premises in uniform,? says Sidharth Pansari of Crossword.

 For the Elgin Road store, kids form the core clientele. ?It does hamper business in a big way, but we cannot encourage bunking and so discourage children coming in without their parents during school hours,? adds Pansari.

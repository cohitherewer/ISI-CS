 Healing amp; helping hands from afar

Swiss Delight: A group of students from Switzerland 

earned money through odd jobs back home to fund a trip to Calcutta. They came 

because it was compulsory, as part of their study. But they left having touched 

little lives in the city. Picture by Rashbehari Das

Compulsory social service projects forced them to 

come to India to work with underprivileged children. But their stay in Calcutta, 

during which they interacted with children of criminals, changed their perception 

of life forever. 

 About 15 students of Steiner School, Switzerland, visited Joyjit Das Memorial School, the Calcutta chapter of Schools of the World, last Wednesday. The children, who receive informal education from the NGO, come from parents with a criminal background. 

 ?For the Swiss students, who are aged between 17 and 19, this is an experience that will teach them a few lessons about how different life can be for different sets of people,? said their tour in-charge and teacher Pascale Ripane.

 Though the two groups don?t even share a common language, communication, they said, was no problem at all. ?We exchanged smiles, they came and sat on our laps and we played games with them. We didn?t need to know their language,? said Nick, one of the Swiss students. 

 ?We were impressed with the level of commitment that the NGO and its volunteers have for the children here, and also with the enthusiasm of the children themselves,? added teacher Generiere Baumann. 

 The two-day stay included a visit to Kalighat and a quick meal on Sudder Street. ?Indian food is lovely, but the spices are sometimes too much,? was a common comment. 

 The trip has been worth the effort that the students have put in ? they funded their visit from money earned through odd jobs back home. ?They are not allowed to borrow money from their parents for this. Besides travel, they even have to fund the project that they visit,? said Ripane. 

 Money raised by them added to contributions from the school itself will go into constructing another building for the school, where children who live near railway tracks will be given shelter. 

 ?Students of Steiner School had earlier visited the Schools of the World chapter in Bodhgaya, and they wanted to visit us in Calcutta. That?s how we got them over,? added Shimonti Das of Joyjit Das Memorial School.

 Glory without glamour: Subhas Santra and

Stars sans twinkle

 This is a story of two international cricketers and their families, sans glamour but with glory. You have never seen them on TV, perhaps you never will. But they deserve, and more importantly need, your attention and support. 

 Arun Santra is an agricultural labourer in Kanaipur. He has three sons. Poverty does not bother him anymore. Subhas and Prabhas, his two deaf, mute and mentally-challenged sons do. 

 Milkman Shyam Sundar Ghose and his wife Sandhya, from Kharial, are marginally better off ? poverty is their bedfellow, too, but only their youngest son, Raju, is mentally-challenged. Twenty-year-old Raju and sixteen-year-old Subhas Santra are good friends, living as they do near each other, a short distance from Konnagar. 

 The two young men have made their parents proud. They were indispensable members of the West Bengal side that reached the finals of the Asia-Pacific Cricket Tournament for the mentally-challenged, held in Ahmedabad from December 1 to 6. 

 Like Arun Santra and his wife Shikha, Raju?s parents are also surprised that their weakest offspring has brought so much honour. Yet, they are not euphoric. Ask them about their future expectations from Subhas and Raju, and Shyam Sundar, Raju?s father, declares: ?Prize peyechhe ek bar, ei jothesto. Beshi kichhu chai na (he?s got a prize once, that?s enough. We don?t want anything more).? Subhas? parents agree. 

 And why not? They have seen ? and been through ? enough to know the ordeals of having mentally-challenged children. Poverty is painful, but it becomes magnified in such a situation. You cannot send the children to school, they cannot mix with their peers and problems only increase as they get older. Sooner or later, you give up.

 These families however, did not. They encouraged Subhas and Raju to compete with normal children. Thus, they learnt to struggle. This fighting spirit is now bringing just rewards. It won them matches against tough opponents like Pakistan and Sri Lanka. 

 The happy parents pass on the credit to Prochesta, the local school for the mentally and physically handicapped. The teachers there identified the latent cricketing talents of these boys and gave them coaching. Subir Ghosh, the favourite teacher of the two budding cricketers, is hopeful that his students will be capable of many more feats in future. 

 It is evident that Subhas and Raju are unaware that they have made the whole of West Bengal proud. Subhas shows the bruise he suffered while taking the catch of the tournament. Raju recalls every shot he played. But they cannot understand why there is so much ado about it all. 

 In fact, according to his mother, Raju was far more impressed with the food and lodging he got in Ahmedabad. ?O bole ?ma, ki bhalo chhilam, ki khaoa, ki shoa. Abar jabo?, (he says ?ma, how great life was there, good food, good place to sleep. I?ll go there again?).? For Subhas, the best part was the AC room.

 Subhas lives under a thatched roof, while chicken is a luxury in Raju?s family. Both know about Sourav Ganguly and both love playing cricket. But neither wants to be a cricketer. Subhas is learning embroidery so that he can earn a living. Raju is not fit enough for even that. 

 Despite their handicaps, they are both intelligent enough to realise that it does not pay to be a handicapped cricketer in this cricket-crazy nation. They can only remain stars without twinkle.

 Support Sushma

 Sushma Singh has always been a delight and an inspiration to everybody around her. Studying as a boarder student in St Thomas? Girls School, Kidderpore, she was an ever-smiling, ever-indulgent Boarder Prefect, a friend to all and an affable and obedient student. 

 Little did we, her classmates, know of the battles she waged everyday. Faced with adverse family circumstances, she completed her education with help from Mr Goodall, who used to work for St Thomas? Boys School, and his family. She then moved on to study arts in Jogmaya Devi College. As the sole earning member of her family, she used to tutor boarders and junior students in her former school. Then tragedy struck. 

 In the string of road accidents to plague the city last week, Sushma, too, was a victim of a corrupt traffic system and bad roads. On February 17, around 7 am, Sushma was knocked down by a speeding truck at the Karl Marx Sarani-Diamond Harbour Road crossing, a stone?s throw from St Thomas? School. Trucks are not allowed to ply there at that time of day. 

 In a critically bleeding state, the police and passers-by took her to SSKM Hospital, where her treatment was postponed for nearly three hours citing ?police case? as the reason, accompanied by a demand for an immediate down-payment of money. 

 When she was finally operated upon, it was only to amputate one of her legs in order to stop the heavy internal bleeding. Put up in the general emergency ward, her classmates and juniors who went to visit her were apalled at the conditions in which people battling for their lives are kept. 

 Sushma?s popularity and generosity, coupled with a quick initiative on the school?s part, ensured that the students raised more than Rs 15,000 on the first day itself, which was put to use by the estate officer of the school, Mr Raha. Rs 35,000 has so far been raised. S. Bhattacharya, principal, St Thomas? Girls School, was the first one to take up a fundraising initiative.

 Among other gestures, the principal of St Thomas? Boys School, Lancelot Fuller, took it upon himself to shift her into a better room and assure her a livelihood in his school when she was ready. Her friends, family and benefactors continue to work towards her betterment.

 Incidents like these only serve to affirm our pledge to be more socially aware, proactive people, so that together we can set things right. Sushma needs all the support she can get. Any help, however small and in whatever form, would be welcome. Dial 9830469790 or 9830858773 to contribute.

 Ad mad

 Twenty-one-year-old Pratik Patel has become the first Indian to offer advertising space on his body. The MA student of computer management from Pune is selling space on his forehead for 30 days through Baazee.com. Pratik will have a non-permanent logo or brand name of the winning bid on his head for a month. He will also donate a portion of the winning amount for tsunami relief. The bid starts at Rs 100,000 and ends on February 20.

 Pratik claims to be have been inspired by the overwhelming response to 20-year-old Andrew Fischer, from Omaha, who had offered advertising space on his forehead through an eBay online auction. It was sold for 30 days to Snorestop, a company specialising in snoring remedies, for $37,375.

 In his listing on Baazee.com, Pratik says: ?I?m a very social animal and always hang around theatres, restaurants, malls, college campuses, Rotary functions, etc. This kind of concept is very new and never ever used in India before. Imagine, everywhere that I go, people will notice your company logo/name on my forehead and talk about it to their friends . No matter who you are or what you are advertising, you can?t go wrong with this campaign!?

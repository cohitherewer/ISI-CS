 It's Your Birthday So...

 You waste no time or words to express your likes and dislikes. You?re laidback, never in a rush to get to the finishing line. In love, you are romantic, passionate and like to savour every moment. At work, you are imaginative and eager to improvise. You are punctual, honest, reliable and diligent about your duties. Learn not to over-stretch yourself and know when to ask for assistance. ? Kusum Bhandari

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Chit Ch@t

Afternoon on wheels

On some fond breast the parting soul relies

Some pious drops the closing eye requires 

E?en from the tomb the voice of nature cries

E?en in our ashes live their wonted fires. 

(An elegy written in a country churchyard, 

by Thomas Gray, written on the rear of a CSTC bus) 

?Oi Shubho! Hang on. Ki? Aare hang 

on! Shubho ekta costume-er obhab noile tui Spiderman hoye gechhish. 

Hain hain... Uri baapre...?

Where would you come across these lines? You ain?t 

a Calcuttan to the core if you don?t answer this one correctly ? that is if you?ve 

had your days travelling to tuitions from Kasba to Kalindi or any other route 

of the like? Jostling, pushing, waiting to be automatically, effortlessly kicked 

out by the universal cosmic forces that conspire against you as soon as your stop 

arrives. 

I?m talking about our buses. Old, rickety, rattling, 

paint peeling from anywhere and everywhere, eternally suspicious-looking glass 

windows threatening to fall down on you any second, always stopping at the wrong 

places and forever giving the right stops a miss. 

Nine am office hour, noon, shondha... Hatibagan, 

EM Bypass, Nimtala... What adds colour and vigour to the joy ride is the amusement 

provided by the teeming humanity represented by the passengers. 

I raised a hullabaloo when I came across a decorous 

columnist in a magazine comparing the ?suav? Mumbaikar chick to her supercilious 

intellectual Kolkatan counterpart?. I, a supercilious Calcuttan chick, invite 

you to my city to take stock. 

And now, how about some gastronomic relief (as Victor 

Banerjee calls it). The natural way. ?Nomoshkaar dada, apnara shobai janen, 

ei peeparation ta toiri hoyechhe joan, aada, aamloki... Hain dekhi dada ekhane 

ektu haat badiye syaempel ta tesht (taste/test) korben.? 

And the little man with greasy hair goes about announcing 

the catalogue of discounts that are on offer on the little hajmi packets. 

The crowd is lulled into sleep by the afternoon breeze...

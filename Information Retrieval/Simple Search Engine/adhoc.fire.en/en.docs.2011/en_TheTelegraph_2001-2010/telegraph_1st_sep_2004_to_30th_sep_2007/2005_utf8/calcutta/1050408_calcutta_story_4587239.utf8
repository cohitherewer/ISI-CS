The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Sent to hotel for patch-up

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 A packed room of Calcutta High Court on Thursday witnessed a scene that could have been out of Kramer vs Kramer. 

 A division bench ordered a young couple fighting a legal battle to spend four days together in a city hotel to try to patch up, for the sake of their two children.

 The bench, while disposing of an anticipatory bail petition by husband Mithun Das, 30, realised that the court should not allow the break-up of a family with two kids ? an 18-month-old boy and a month-old girl.

 Mithun feared arrest in connection with a case lodged by his wife Dipanjana, 27, alleging physical and mental torture at her in-laws? at Belghoria Police Housing Estate. 

 Dipanjana, in her FIR, claimed that she had to leave her in-laws? and was living with her parents at Bediapara, in Dum Dum, along with her two children.

 ?We feel that interference of the guardians of both the husband and wife is creating a problem. Let the couple stay in a hotel for some days. We hope that both will realise their fault and both will decide to stay on together,? ruled the division bench of Justice Amit Talukdar. 

 The court decided that the couple should try reconciliation before it passed any order on the anticipatory bail petition. ?A court order in this matter may separate the husband and the wife forever. It is better to take a chance,? the court observed. 

 The bench asked Mithun?s father, Sunil Kumar Das, a sub-inspector of Jorabagan police station, to book a hotel room for four days. 

 Later, when the father informed the court that a room had been booked, the court directed government lawyer Jayanta Narayan Chatterjee to send the couple to the hotel.

 ?None of the members of the two families will be allowed to disturb the couple. Both the children will stay with Dipanjana?s mother. The couple will come to attend court straight from hotel on Monday,? the judges ordered. 

 Later in the afternoon, the government lawyer sent the couple to the central Calcutta hotel. 

 The lawyer did not even allow the couple to fetch a change of clothes from their respective homes. 

 ?Buy your night suits on the way to the hotel,? the lawyer told the couple. The fathers of both parties gave them money to pay their hotel bills.

 ?Both of you will be guided by the court. The court wants to see you smiling on Monday. Try to respect the gesture of the judge,? Chatterjee told the couple as they left the courtroom.

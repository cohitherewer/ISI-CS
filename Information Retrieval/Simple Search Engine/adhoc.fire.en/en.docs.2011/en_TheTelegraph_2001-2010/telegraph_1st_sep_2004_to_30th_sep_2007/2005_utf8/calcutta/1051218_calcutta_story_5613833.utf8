The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Next weekend you can be at... 

Gopalpur-on-Sea

 There?s nothing quite like the sea to soothe frayed city nerves and fortunately for Calcuttans, there are options aplenty for weekend vacations on the beach. If Puri and Digha are too run-of-the-mill for your liking, head for Gopalpur-on-Sea. Long walks along the tranquil coastline with the frothy waters fondling your feet will leave you craving for more.

 The day starts early here, long before sunrise, with the sweet notes of the shehnai from Venugopal Mandir and aazan from the mosque near the watchtower. The fishermen can be seen carrying the boats from their shacks to the sea.

 By the time they set off, the chariot of the sun has made its first appearance on the eastern horizon. In the early morning sunshine, the boats with their colourful sails make a pretty picture against the azure sky as they fight the current to the heart of the green ocean.

 There is not much to do during the day, except take a joyride on Mohan?s boat. It plies from one end of the backwater to the other.

 The rest of the time can be spent lazing on the beach. The beautiful patterns created on the sand by the receding waves will make you wonder about the geometric sense of nature.

 Evening on the beach has a flavour of its own. All of a sudden long lines of yellow and blue sails appear on the horizon, bobbing with the waves, like pearls on a string.

 Once the fishermen reach the shore, the day?s catch is auctioned on the beach. Mini-markets crop up everywhere on the sand, as if at the wave of a magic wand.

 The fishermen stand in circles discussing the day?s travails and waiting for their payments. Seagulls hover over the beach for the spoils.

 The catch is transported from here to several parts of the globe. If you don?t mind the smell, you can watch the packing while downing vadas and pakoras at eateries that dot the beach. 

 Half-an-hour from Gopalpur is an abandoned port. Here, a bridge, propped up by iron pillars, extends about a kilometre into the sea.

 The surroundings are a little worn out, but if it is rustic charm you are looking for, you won?t be disappointed. Stop over at the cashew factory on your way back to town.

 Going : 

 The nearest airport is Bhubaneswar, which is 150 km away. The Calcutta-Chennai train route touches Brahmapur, which is 16 km from Gopalpur. Buses, autorickshaws and cars are available from there. If you are planning to go by road, take National Highway 5

 Staying : 

 There are several hotels. A room with double bed costs between Rs 250 and Rs 900. Green Park, Sea Pearl, Song of the Sea, Seaside Breeze are some of the better-known hotels here

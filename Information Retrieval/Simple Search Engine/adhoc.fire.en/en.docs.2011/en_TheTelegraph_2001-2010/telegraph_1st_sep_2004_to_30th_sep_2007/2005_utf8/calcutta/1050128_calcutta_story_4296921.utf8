 Governor resolves food muddle

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 The growing incidence of food adulteration has prompted Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi to play a decisive role in civic affairs. 

 Following his orders in December last year, a year-long impasse over the deployment of 29 non-medical food inspectors has come to an end. 

 Municipal commissioner Debashis Som last week handed over appointment letters to the inspectors and authorised them to collect food items from commercial outlets.

 Before issuing the order, the Governor had reviewed the situation. He was told that the municipal commissioner lacked the power to discharge the duties of the Food (Health) Authority, under the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954. 

 The problem regarding non-medical food inspectors began in late 2003, when the civic authorities decided to depart from the usual practice of appointing only doctors as food inspectors. 

 Mayor Subrata Mukherjee?s logic was that as the primary duty of a food inspector was to collect samples of dubious food items and deposit them for clinical tests, a science graduate who had studied chemistry could well do the job.

 The authorities decided to appoint 29 science graduates to fill the vacant posts.

 In December 2003, the recruitment files were sent to the health department for a gazette notification. But the health department doubted the competence of the inspectors, none of whom had a diploma in public health. 

 The notification was never issued and the matter had been hanging fire till the Governor?s intervention.

 ?It was really a dark phase for us. We had no manpower to collect food items from eateries,? said mayor Mukherjee, who has taken up a Rs 50-lakh scheme to revamp the civic food laboratory.

Punishing the guilty: The mayor has been holding 

dialogue with the municipal commissioner to find ways to book eatery-owners selling 

adulterated food. This follows a revelation that not a single accused has been 

punished in the past 20 years because of the long-drawn legal process.

 Mukherjee wants to cancel the licences of such businessmen, which will be renewed only if they are acquitted by a court of law.

Seals seized: The civic authorities have received 

complaints that one or two of the four former medical food inspectors, promoted 

to the post of medical officer, are still visiting outlets posing as inspectors. 

 Their seals and other credentials given to them as food inspectors have been seized.

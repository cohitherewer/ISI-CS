The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Consoles uncork the Bubbly

 - AD LINES, TELLY TRACKS MINGLE WITH FILM TUNES

 PRATIM D. GUPTA

 I wanna be your lover, Bubbly?

 Kyunki saas bhi kabhi bahu thi?

 After Bollywood and UK-Bhangra, ad jingles and television themes are invading the disc console. Airtel, Close Up, Pepsi, Coke, the K-series ? it?s jingle all the way from the floors of Fusion to the sofas of Shisha.

 ?An advertisement tune is often a more popular option than a new Hindi film track,? says DJ Akash. ?The party hoppers may not have heard the Bollywood song before but they have definitely checked out the commercial on telly. When I mixed in the Bubbly jingle (Pepsi) last Saturday night, the crowd just went berserk.?

 The man behind this particular Pepsi tune, music director Vishal Dadlani (one half of the Vishal-Shekhar duo of Jhankaar Beats fame) is ecstatic. ?That?s a step forward for us since ad jingles have always been a big hit at discos abroad. The Axe song I like to party is a rage at nightclubs around the world,? he says.

 But how does one stretch a 30-second jingle to a full-fledged remix track? A different beat, a new loop and a simple copy-paste can get you a two-minute-long hip-shaking chartbuster.

 And if it?s the small screen, can the Balaji bandwagon be far behind? The themes for the popular saas-bahu serials have also found a place in the DJ?s kitty. ?After I heard it in a Mumbai disco, I got hold of the themes of Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi, Kumkum, Kasauti Zindagi Kay and Kaisa Yeh Pyar Hai and put them together in a mixed track. The Calcutta crowds just went crazy in the pre-Holi bash when I played it,? says Shisha?s DJ Girish.

 There?s also the fear, however, of forcing some die-hard party people off the dance floor. ?When you pinch in an ad jingle in the middle of film tracks, many would just stop dancing and look at you. After all, it?s something entirely new. So it should be mixed in at a time when they are already in the groove and don?t get intimidated by, say, Kya aap Close Up karte hain?? says Akash.

 What make ad jingles more prone to mixing are the diverse music genres they fall under. ?Being catchy is a must but you have various music forms from hip-hop to jazz to rock ?n? roll in the different ads. That makes the baseline easier to get hold of and hence easier to mix,? says music maker Ashutosh Pathak, a veteran of many an ad jingle, including Hutch and ICICI.

 Taking the merger of telly and tracks a step forward, now DJs across the country are busy working on the theme track of Remix, the serial on STAR One, sung by the pop band Aasma and composed by Pritam of Dhoom fame.

 ?It?s fascinating that the song is finding its way to the discos,? says Aasma?s Jimmy. ?I think the youth feel of the song and the college theme of the serial have blended very well to appeal to the disc hoppers.?

 That?s the way, they seem to like it these days.

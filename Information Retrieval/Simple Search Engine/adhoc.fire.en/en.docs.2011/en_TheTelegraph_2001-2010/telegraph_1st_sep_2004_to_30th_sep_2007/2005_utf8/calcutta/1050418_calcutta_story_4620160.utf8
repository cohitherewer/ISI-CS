Angels Decoded was the name given to a summery collection by designers Sudhir and Tapash, who are known for their label Stae. Keeping their fingers crossed for Lakm? India Fashion Week next year, this talented duo has reproduced the theme of allurement ? ?a touch of softness that sits happily with the neutrals?, showcased at Ogaan recently. 

 The collection has been divided into four parts, the first being printed patterns on textured fabrics embellished with gota ribbons. 

 Colours come into focus next with the use of shades as varied as dusty apricot, old gold, mustard yellow, yellow gold, camel, peach, orange, brown, bronze, wood tones, dusky pink, fuschia, coral turquoise, washed-out blue, ice blue, beige and sapphire. Geometric shapes rule as far as patterns are concerned. Blended stripes with speckled prints and dual-coloured reversible fabrics make a huge impact. 

 A series of graphic art designs combined with floral prints defines another range. 

 ?We enjoy experimenting with colours, textures and styles to come up with innovative patterns ideal for summer,? said Tapash.

 Colourful threads, mirror work, hand embroidery, gota work and panelling lend a richer dimension to the ensembles. 

 Beach best

 It may be a long long time before the skies open up, but the city had its own share of wet and wild fun on Saturday. 

 A beachwear show by the Park poolside at Bar H2O was where all the action was, drawing a crowd of about a hundred people. 

 Walking through six sequences of minimalist wear, choreographed by Sharique, the models finally donned the all-wet look in the last sequence sprinkling water on themselves possibly in a bid to outdo the rain gods. 

 The backdrop of clear blue water of the pool helped neutralise the heat that the hot bods generated to some extent. 

 Fishy fare

 If a holiday to Goa is not feasible at the moment, the least you can indulge in is seafood pleasures in your own city. Starstruck restaurant in Forum has some delicious seafood on offer in the Indian, Chinese and Continental categories. 

 On till April 20, the festival boasts a large variety of fish, prawn, crab and lobster. Spicy Indian options like the fast- moving Tandoor Fish Tikka cooked in Kuwaiti style, to the plain Seafood Neptune, (prawns tossed in a white sauce) ? there?s something for every palate. 

 Try the buffet that?s up for grabs at Rs 350 plus taxes, or go for the a la carte menu, available for both lunch and dinner. ?We are serving all three cuisines in the buffet, but the menu changes from day to day,? said a spokesperson of the restaurant. 

 Sushi slurp

 If you want your food to look as good as it tastes, sample some sushi. 

 The Japanese delicacy is on offer at Pan Asian at ITC Sonar Bangla till April 24. 

 ?Prepared with a lot of passion and emotion, the colourful spread of sushi is a feast for the stomach as well as the eyes. The traditional Japanese way of presenting the food is nearly as important as its taste,? said a spokesperson of the hotel.

 Colloquially speaking, the term sushi is used to describe a finger-size piece of raw fish or other ingredients on a bed of vinegared rice. This is usually dipped in Japanese soy sauce and Wasabi (Japanese horseradish) before eating. 

 Some of the non-vegetarian options are Maki (rice and seaweed rolls with fish or vegetables), Salmon Maki (marinated rice stuffed with fresh salmon and enclosed in seaweed), Tuna Maki, Prawn Maki, Egg Maki, Cuttlefish Maki, Seabass Maki (Japanese marinated rice stuffed with seabass and enclosed in seaweed) and Chicken Terri Maki (rice stuffed with chicken in Teriyaki sauce accompanied with spring onions and enclosed in seaweed). 

 For those who love their greens, there are a variety of options as well ? Carrot Maki, Radish Maki and Japanese Pickle Plum (marinated rice stuffed with pickled plum and enclosed in seaweed), to name a few. 

 The non-vegetarian and vegetarian platters are priced at Rs 250 and Rs 200 respectively, for six pieces. 

 The fare is on offer for lunch during weekends and for dinner every day.

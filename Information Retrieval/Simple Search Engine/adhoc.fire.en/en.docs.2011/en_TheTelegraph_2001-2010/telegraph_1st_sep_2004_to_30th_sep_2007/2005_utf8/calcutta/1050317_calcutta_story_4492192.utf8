The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Trendy to the tee

From the philosophical to the funky 

catchy one-liners on T-shirts help you wear your attitude, says Ipsita Deb

Christina Aguilera?s trademark concert T-shirt scribbled 

with the word ?stripped? might have become part of the singer?s identity, but 

you don?t need to have star power to wear your attitude on your sleeves (or across 

your chest, as the case might be). 

T-shirts shouting out funky one-liners can make quite 

a statement and the style is as eternal as the garment itself. The words you flaunt 

can go a long way to reflect your mood or flash your spirit.

From social, political and religious to witty gender-specific, 

the one liners can be on any and every subject under the summer sun. Armed with 

a plain T-shirt and a paintbrush you can scribble just about anything, anywhere, 

stores around town offer quite a wide spectrum to choose from. Goodlife 

checks out the fare.

Gender render

This section, popular with both sexes, throws up the 

hotsellers in most city stores. Thou shalt wear mini skirts; If we were what 

we eat? I?m cheap, fast and easy; Kiss me b4 my boyfriend comes back; If you have 

nothing nice to say about anyone come sit next to me; If you?re cute, I?m single; 

I?ve got the looks if you?ve got the money; Via Agra (Man?s greatest erection 

for a woman) ? the list of phrases, catchy and corny, is endless. You can 

spot a fairly wide variety of these at Westside. 

The range at this 22 Camac Street store comprises 

two types of tees ? two-piece sleeveless and regular cap-sleeved ones. ?The former 

is referred to as the Downtown Story, since it is perfect for both partying and 

daily wear,? explained a spokesperson for Westside. The price tag: Rs 199 to Rs 

299.

Designer Priyanjali Ray, operating from her studio 

at 5, Alipore Park Road, has come up with some interesting ones, too. Tee-sers: 

You know you?re in trouble when a woman says FINE! (followed by whatever); 

I shop therefore I am; The real Bridget Jones or Jack of trades, master of self. 

Priced at Rs 300, these even allow you to phrase your 

own frame of mind at no extra cost. 

Tantric tales

Few of the brands can match the wit and humour of 

Tantra, the most popular line in T-shirts with slogans.

Available at quite a few stores including Landmark 

and Shoppers? Stop, these dwell on various subjects, from the serious to the funky. 

Sample these: Beer makes you smarter. It made bud wiser; Definition of dhobi 

? the only person who can tell your wife: ?Bhabhi kapde nikal kar rakhiye, main 

aata hoon?; As you think so you are ? Buddha.

Religious and philosophical sayings also abound in 

this range, as do the less serious wisecracks about different professions. The 

IT guys can flaunt tees reading There?s life beyond dot.com or Mental 

inside (a spoof on Intel).

?Tantra is definitely the fastest-selling T-shirt 

brand. The demand is huge among college-goers and the stock vanishes from the 

racks in no time,? says Somnath Sarkar, store manager at Shoppers? Stop, in Forum.

The Tantra tees are priced at Rs 295.

Political points

Flaunting your patriotism or taking a dig at politicians 

? whatever your style, Stop, the in-house label at Shoppers? Stop, will give you 

adequate options.

Made of cotton knits or denims, the tees have words 

and symbols conveying the Indian theme. While there are some overtly patriotic 

ones with flag colours splashed all over, some bear witty sayings like 

Come to India. 1 billion people can?t be wrong. 

Some tongue-in-chic digs at politicians by Tantra 

include: 99 per cent of politicians give the rest a bad name; Zero is India?s 

contribution to the world of Mathematics (we always knew we were good for nothing).

Student savour

You can take a trip down memory lane with a picture 

or motto of your school or college painted across your tee. A few lines from your 

school anthem or a group photo of your college gang imprinted on the garment could 

make for great memorabilia. While many institutions sell their own tees (for instance, 

Promodda at Presidency College), you could also get them custom-made. 

Star splash 

Star-struck teenyboppers all over the world just love 

to wear their favourite celeb?s face on their T-shirts. The ideal haunts to hunt 

these down are the roadside stalls at New Market or Gariahat. The options usually 

range between Bollywood superstars and cricketing heroes.

The ones available at the stores include international 

icons like Madonna, Michael Jackson or Britney Spears.

Creative call

If you have an artistic bent of mind, and a few spare 

hours to give your imagination a free run, pick up a paintbrush and scribble with 

a vengeance.

l you need is a set of fabric paints, brushes, a plain 

T-shirt, a piece of cardboard to fit inside the T-shirt, a stencil and loads of 

creativity!

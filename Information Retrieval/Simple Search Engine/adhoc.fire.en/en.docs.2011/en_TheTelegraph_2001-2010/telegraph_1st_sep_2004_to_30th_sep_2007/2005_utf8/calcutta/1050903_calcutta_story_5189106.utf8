 After serving up lip-smacking kebabs and other tandoori delicacies, DFire Ice at 52A, Sarat Bose Road has come up with a new menu. The 10-month-old restaurant is famous for an assortment of kebabs.

 We already serve a variety of kebabs but there were repeated requests from customers to add more items, says Dimpy Singh, owner of the restaurant.

 The vegetarian section now includes Punjabi Aloo Kebab, Kadai Paneer and Tawa Vegetables. The non-vegetarian section includes Chicken Garlic Kebabs, Chicken Peshawari, Labab Chicken, Dhania Murg and Fish Maharani.

 The Chinese additions are Dry Chilli Potato, Fried American Corns, Vegetable Tung Fong, Tung Fong Chicken, Lemon Chicken and Chicken Pan Fried Noodles.

 Modern look

 Furniture shops are mushrooming here, there and everywhere. Some lay store by the traditional, others go all modern. Mobel Furniture, at 8/1, Loudon Street, has just introduced a whole new line of modern furniture.

 Previously, we would deal in traditional furniture that came in preset designs and not in many colours. But the demand pattern and the choice of people has undergone a major change, says Arun Kumar Biyani, owner, Mobel Furniture. So, we have introduced this line imported from China. Modern look, high quality finish and reasonable prices are the three best things about this range.

 A bedroom set with a sliding wardrobe comes for Rs 40,000 whereas sofa sets range between Rs 25,000 and Rs 55,000. The crockery cabinets and dining tables come for Rs 15,000 and Rs 25,000 respectively. The furniture range is available in maple, black oak and cherry colours.

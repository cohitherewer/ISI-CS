Slow-burning creativity

 Nine films in 33 years may be too little a number over too long a span for many a film-maker. But Adoor Gopalakrishnan cares neither for volume nor for the spotlight it brings. Does being prolific undermine quality? ?I don?t think so? It varies from individual to individual. Some are prolific and yet very creative. I belong to the category whose energy is slow in coming,? laughs the sexagenarian.

 The white-haired Malayalam film-maker, the most significant one of the post-Satyajit Ray-Mrinal Sen generation, doesn?t start a film unless he is really enthused by an idea. Since his debut film Swayamavaram in 1972, Adoor has made eight more hard-hitting feature films apart from a bunch of documentaries. ?My average interval is three years. But now it is getting longer,? he smiles, in town to attend a retrospective of his works.

 Comprising screenings and discussions, the 12-day-long event has been organised by Seagull Foundation for the Arts in collaboration with National Film of India (Pune), Films Division and Nandan.

 ?I feel a period of contemplation is necessary before starting a film. I spend time writing all my films from my own ideas. I don?t adapt works of others. Then, once it is made, I am involved with the distribution. Even the ads are shown after being approved by me,? explains Adoor.

 On the few occasions that he has adapted the works of others, Adoor has picked the idea and developed it into something of his own. Besides, the script never dictates what happens on the sets as he ?allows the idea an organic growth?. So, the script keeps evolving even during the shooting.

 ?One has to grow out of one film before making another. Otherwise you become very repetitive, which is the worst thing that can happen to you. I don?t start a film unless I really feel enthused by the idea because the enthusiasm has to sustain me through this long period of making the film,? stresses the man who also sparked the Film Society movement in Kerala in 1965. ?We started off by hosting a festival of 21 films which were shown all over Kerala. The only two Indian films were Devi (Satyajit Ray) and Meghe Dhaka Tara (Ritwik Ghatak),? he reminisces.

 But where has the movement gone from there? ?I feel it has only changed its character. There are more film festivals now? and people are also building up personal collections of many rare films.?

 Calcutta is close to his heart for Ritwik, Ray and Mrinal Sen. ?One (Ritwik) was my teacher and I have been very close to the other two,? adds Adoor, before leaving to meet Mrinalda.

 But who has influenced him the most? ?If influences mean making replicas, then no. All three give you the right kind of spirit and enthusiasm to make films.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Flower power push in festival of hues

 JAYANTA BASU

 Holi fever has gripped Jadavpur University?s chemical engineering department days before the festival of colour will be celebrated.

 A group of 15 is working overtime in the ground-floor workshop of the department to meet a deadline ? mass production of eco-friendly Puspa Abir before the festivity starts.

 ?We will have to produce at least 1,000 kg of abir before Holi,? says departmental head Siddhartha Dutta, who has discovered the floral extracts-based formulation. 

 ?There is a high demand for our abir among informed customers,? says grocery store owner Mihir Maity.

 Dutta, who had earlier discovered various shades of colours to be used on cloth and had received an Indian patent, has prepared Puspa Abir using extracts of the hibiscus, marigold, dopati and aparajita. The powder will be available in shades of pink, violet, yellow, green and deep orange.

 ?We did not anticipate that it would become so popular. Around 250 kg was sold out in the health fair within a couple of days. A businessman from Burrabazar already procured 200 kg of the abir and now, even small-time traders are buying it directly from us,? a departmental employee told Metro.

 The department had initially planned to produce packets of various sizes, ?but a time constraint is forcing us to produce packets of 250 gm and 500 gm only,? he added.

 These are in excess of around 100 kg of abir that Visva-Bharati had ordered much earlier for the Doljatra celebrations in Santiniketan.

 ?We are very eager to play Holi with an abir that is prepared from floral extracts,? says vice-chancellor Sujit Basu. ?Our scientists will examine the product and once they confirm the claims of the producers, we will use it in larger quantities in future.?

 According to a scientist of Jadavpur University: ?Unlike the varieties found in the market, our abir, though marginally costlier, is absolutely eco-friendly and does not cause any irritation on the skin or in the eyes.?

 Puspa Abir, he explains, is prepared on a talcum powder base, while the common varieties are made of soil powder contaminated with toxic materials or crushed soft stones. 

 The initial processing of floral abir was done in a pilot plant in Bagnan, set up with contributions from the member of Parliament?s Local Area Development Fund.

 Pitabasan Das, vice-president of the NGO Maromi (actively associated with the process), says the demand is not just encouraging, but is steadily on the rise.

 Subrata Basu, deputy manager of West Bengal State Food Processing and Horticulture Development Corporation, observes: ?We plan to involve unemployed youths in the production and marketing of the abir in the future, not only contributing to their economic development but also utilising a lot of flowers which otherwise add to the waste.?

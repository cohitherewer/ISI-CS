 CU rules not passed on

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A communication gap has been plaguing Calcutta University, with key departments often left uninformed of the latest decisions or amendments. 

 This, despite a high court order five years ago that the university introduce measures to keep students, teachers and departmental heads abreast of every new rule. The authorities were directed to publish copies of the new rules and amendments and distribute them to all concerned.

 Had the university complied with the directive, it would not have lost its face in the high court in the Subhendu Biswas case a fortnight ago.

 Subhendu had failed in the M.Sc (physics) examinations twice, in 2001 and 2002, and moved the court seeking a directive that the authorities produce relevant documents to establish the grounds on which he was declared unsuccessful. 

 The university failed to produce the documents, prompting the court to issue another directive, this time asking the authorities to declare Subhendu successful.

 Later, the university?s examination department found that the rule based on which Subhendu was failed had been amended in 2002. But the change had not been communicated to the department.

 Subhendu?s case is not unique. Several like him are being inconvenienced almost daily because the authorities keep the departments in the dark about major decisions, including those of the Senate and the Syndicate ? the two highest policy-making bodies of the university.

 ?Every student has the right to know the rules and regulations of the university, particularly those involving examination procedures, like evaluation and reviewing of answer-scripts. But the university hardly has any arrangement to keep us informed about them,? a student said.

 Controller of examinations Onkar Sadhan Adhikari said: ?It is very important for my department to be promptly informed about the amendments to rules concerning examinations.? 

 Registrar Ujwal Basu said the university publishes booklets containing revised rules and regulations. ?We are looking into the complaints about communication gap.?

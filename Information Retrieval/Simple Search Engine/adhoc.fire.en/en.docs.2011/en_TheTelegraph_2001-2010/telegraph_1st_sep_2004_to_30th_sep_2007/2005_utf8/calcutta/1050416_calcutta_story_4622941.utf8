 On the edge of reason

 Taking a break from his favourite sleuth, Sandip Ray spent most of last winter in the freezing temperatures of Kalimpong, trying to capture on celluloid a close-knit family crumbling in a crisis. Hours before the premiere of Nishijapon on Poila Baisakh eve, the director and five of his cast members settled for an adda with a select audience at the Airtel outlet in City Centre.

 ?The film is based on a very intriguing story by Narayan Gangopadhyay and I wanted to do it for a long while. It is a non-Feluda film and, so, is more challenging for me. Every character here has a definite and vital role to play,? said Sandip, flanked by Sabyasachi Chakraborty, Dipankar De, Parambrata Chatterjee, Raima Sen and Rituparna Sengupta. The film also stars Soumitra Chatterjee.

 At the core of Nishijapon is an earthquake which shatters the peaceful holiday ambience and triggers an inner turbulence, revealing hidden shades of character. ?But I just wanted to give an impression of the earthquake because this film is not Poseidon Adventure or Day After Tomorrow... We have shot on two different sets but you won?t be able to differentiate the two,? explained the director.

 ?The earthquake is just the backdrop. The film is actually about relationships and what happens when a family is stranded in an isolated house with no food,? pitched in Sabyasachi. 

 One of the audience members wanted Dipankar De to share his experiences of working with first father and then son. ?Both Satyajit Ray and Sandip have a similar way of functioning but I feel Sandip has even surpassed his father in shot division. The shot divisions of Nishijapon were really short which allowed greater creativity,? said De.

 Queries aimed at Sandip Ray harped on his target audience among GenX. ?Every film finds a section of audience for itself. I feel any good film will be lapped up by the young generation,? felt the director, who has honed his skills on the small screen with a string of Feluda stories. ?But no more TV for now. I have already done quite a lot,? stressed Sandip, before leaving to catch the screening of Nishijapon at 89 Cinemas with mother Bijoya Ray and family.

 Cast and crew apart, those spotted trooping in for the premiere included Goutam Ghose, Moon Moon Sen, Ranjit Mullick with daughter Koel, Kaushik and Churni Ganguly, June and Arindam Sil.

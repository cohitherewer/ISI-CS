 Rites of marriage 

 Juhi Chawla and Irrfan in moments from 7 ? Phere

 After The Truman Show and Quiz Show, it?s time for 7 ? Phere. Films about television may not be new to India with White Noise and Humdum being the recent sincere forays into the subject, but when you call your film a behind-the-scenes footage of a typical Indian wedding, it takes on a different shape altogether.

 Ishaan Trivedi, whose claim to fame till date has been the dialogues of Ghulam and Socha Na Tha, is the writer-director of this new low-budget film, starring Irrfan and Juhi Chawla in the lead roles. 

 ?The film?s producers came to me for a script to be directed by someone from the south,? reveals Ishaan, who?s worked as a commissioning editor for STAR Plus and Zee TV before turning to the big screen. ?I gave the half-page treatment of 7 ? Phere and told them that I would like to direct it too. That?s how things got rolling.?

 Inspired by marriage videos, Ishaan wanted to explore the hushed whispers and the smothered smirks that go on behind the glitz and glamour of a wedding. ?We start off with this very successful television channel who wants to tread new ground, now that viewers are fatigued by their programmes. And shooting marriages is something they come up with. When the channel is not allowed to do so, it uses hidden cameras to explore the lives beyond the wedding vows. While Juhi plays the director of the show, Irrfan plays the bride?s uncle.?

 Ishaan has used his stint with the TV industry as source material for the script, but without prejudice. ?Whatever I have experienced during my work with the television channels I have used in a very farcical way, yet not ridiculing the system. The film is ultimately about how these channels on the small screen dictate the lives of real people.?

 The cast, feels Ishaan, was easy to pick. ?Juhi was our first and only choice. We were looking at someone in the 32-33 age category and not in the usual 23-24 region. And since it?s a fun film, Juhi was an obvious selection. Irrfan was one year junior to me in National School of Drama. He is such a brilliant actor and this will be his first foray into comedy. I am sure he is going to surprise many with his performance again.?

 Ishaan, who is looking beyond the multiplex viewership, adds: ?The film does not talk about anything in a very intellectual way. I believe it is for all kinds of audiences. We have tried to keep things very simple. Even the word TRP is used just five or six times in the film.?

 Once the pheres are taken at the theatres, Ishaan will be ready to direct his next film, which deals with reincarnation.

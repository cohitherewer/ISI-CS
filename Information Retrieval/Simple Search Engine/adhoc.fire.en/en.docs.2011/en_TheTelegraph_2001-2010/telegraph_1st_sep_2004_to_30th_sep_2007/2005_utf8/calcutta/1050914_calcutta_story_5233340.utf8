 Revelry with rules in place

 Today?s question: Will the new pandal rules rob Durga puja of its grandeur? More letters will be published next week

 Right of way: En route to Mohammed Ali Park

 Prasanta Kumar Ghosh,

 Barasat

 The new pandal rules need to be adhered to. Space must be left for easy movement of traffic, pedestrians, fire brigade, ambulance and police.

 Abdul Fateh Kamruddin, 

 Chandbati, Hooghly

 The new pandal rules are most welcome. They will not become a hurdle for Puja organisers, but shield the general people from problems. The organisers who are under the impression that the majority of the population wants Pujas to be held as they are, will be surprised if they conduct an opinion poll. 

 Dalim Kumar Dutta, 

 APC Road

 Puja is the greatest festival of Bengalis, so it is natural that there will be some amount of grandeur associated with it. But for several years, organisers of big Pujas have misused the freedom given to them to make life difficult for ordinary citizens. They must be reined in.

 Kajal Chatterjee,

 Sodepur 

 If blocked roads, stalls on footpaths and damaged trees, parks and streets lead to Puja ?grandeur?, we must immediately learn to do without it. If the new rules are implemented, decency, sanity and civility will be restored to the Puja.

 Biswajyoti Bagchi, 

 Alipore

 If implemented, the new pandal rules will definitely not mar the grandeur of Durga puja. The ?if? is vital because most sarbojanin Pujas enjoy the patronage of political leaders, who flout rules at will.

 Tapas Kumar Kar,

 Behala

 Mere size of pandals cannot curb the fervour and zest associated with the Puja. On the contrary, monumental pandals and footpaths dotted with stalls mar the merriment associated with the autumn event.

 Priyanka Saha,

 Address not given

 The new pandal rules would not lessen the grandeur of the Puja. Organisers, in their bid to outdo each other, have made the festival unpleasant for many residents of the city. Something needs to be done about that. 

 Hemanta Kumar Dutta,

 Shibpur

 The administration should not allow organisers to do as they please in the name of Puja. The implementation of the rules is overdue. The initiative is likely to inconvenience some political heavyweights and hence, is praiseworthy. This year?s Puja could turn out to be the best ever, thanks to the rules.

 Govind Das Dujari,

 Diamond Harbour Road 

 The new pandal rules will provide welcome relief to pandal-hoppers. Grandeur should not be confused with size. And what is the use of Puja grandeur that causes inconvenience to visitors? I feel only those pujas that adhere to the rules should be considered for the Puja awards. The rules will also help check eve-teasing and pickpocketing.

 Subho Bhattacharya,

 Deb Lane

 Surely, it is not good to celebrate Puja by inconveniencing others. I think ordinary citizens are not going to be affected a great deal by the injunctions. The grand show will continue, without losing any of its vibrancy. 

 Ujjal Bhattacharyya, 

 CIT Road

 The new rules will definitely not rob the Puja of its grandeur. On the contrary, it would make the festival hazard-free. Many people have stopped venturing out during Puja due to traffic congestion. If the rules are implemented, they, too, would join the celebrations. If anything, the rules would restore the lost grandeur of the Puja.

 Chameli Pal,

 Batanagar

 Even if Durga puja loses its grandeur due to the new rules, so what? A perceived sense of grandeur and the resultant inflated egos of the organisers are no compensation for the inconvenience faced by the common people. The right of ordinary people to use public roads is non-negotiable. Who are the puja organisers to decide what people want?

 Rahul Roy,

 Dum Dum

 It?s not the size of the pandals, but their decoration, design and the idols inside the pandals that give Puja its grandeur. The new rules will make things more systematic, disciplined and enjoyable. 

 Sayan Banerjee,

 Belgachhia Road

 The new rules will not rob the Puja of its grandeur but add life to it. The rules will ensure a safe and hassle-free Puja. Quite often, pandals block roads in such a way that people are forced to take detours even during emergencies. This must be stopped.

 Abanti Chowdhury,

 Shibpur

 The puja organisers cannot go on infringing on citizens? rights in the name of sentiments. Even tradition has to adapt to the demands of social existence and welfare. The new rules might diminish Puja grandeur but will certainly not make the festival less enjoyable.

 After being crowned second runners-up at the Ford Supermodel Contest in Mumbai last week, Calcutta girl Sreshthaa Paul had a heart-to-heart with GoodLife.

 DoB: November 28, 1984.

 Schooling: Since my father had a transferable job, I began my education with Sacred Heart Convent in Nagaland and then studied in Pearl Valley School, Guwahati, before completing high school in 2003 from Future Foundation, Calcutta. 

 College: Currently studying English (honours), second year, at Bhawanipur Education Society College.

 First stint in modelling: At 16, for a family friends graduation portfolio.

 First campaign: Chandrani Pearls in 2003.

 Role models: Naomi Campbell and Nayanika Chatterjee Singh.

 Turning point: Featuring in the top five at the Metropolitan Top Model contest was a huge moment. The finals were held in November 2003 in New Delhi. Loads of big assignments and fashion shoots followed soon after. 

 Ford Supermodel Contest: After qualifying on November 6 from Calcutta, she left for Mumbai on the 11th. Extensive training sessions began on the 12th with experts like Nayanika, choreographer Achla Sachdev and fitness trainer Dianne Pandey. The November 26 finals saw Sreshthaa finish as the second runners-up. I was definitely disappointed I didnt win, especially when the first runners-up place was bagged by a girl who came in just two days before the finals, she rues.

 What next: Though her contest and contract details dont require her to shift base, Sreshthaa does plan to move from Tollygunge to Mumbai soon. All to build contacts and network. She dreams to be part of the Mumbai catwalk army and star in many more commercial campaigns. Films, she stresses, do not feature in her scheme of things at all.

 Industry banter: People in Calcutta are still obsessed with conventional looks and pretty faces. Thats why many didnt like my looks initially. But thankfully, I was accepted within the fashion circuit, which is now willing to experiment much more.

 Diet diktat: Papaya and skimmed milk with four egg whites at 6 am, followed by two hours of workout. A slice of brown bread, baked beans, stewed chicken and fruits make up her after-exercise meal. Lunch is usually dal, an occasional chapati, chicken or vegetables. Only non-fat yoghurt and wheat biscuits for a snack, and grilled fish or chicken for a light dinner round off the days diet.

 Calcuttas best: My family, friends and the city in general. The warmth here is unbeatable. Our close-knit modelling circuit has boosted my career majorly.

 Trivia: Though Sreshthaa was surely considered one of the thinner models in the city, touching down in Mumbai made her realise that she was fat! Everyone is so thin there that I forced myself to lose two kgs in 15 days, laughs the model.

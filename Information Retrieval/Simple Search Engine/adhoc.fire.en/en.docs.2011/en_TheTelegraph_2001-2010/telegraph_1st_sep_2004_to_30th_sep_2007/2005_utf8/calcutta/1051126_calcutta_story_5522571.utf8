 Mythology casts a spell 

Of myth versus magic

 - Cineplexes see monkey god gobble up Goblet sales

 Hanuman, playing himself: Soaring high

 One costs about Rs 850 crore. The other Rs 2.5 crore. One has just entered Week II. The other has sailed into Week V. One comes on the back of the world?s biggest book series. The other has been dug out from the long-lost tales of Indian mythology.

 Yet, Harry Potter has met his match ? and more ? in Hanuman, at least in the city cineplexes. After a flying start, Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire has stumbled at the box-office while Hanuman, India?s first 2D-animation film, is growing, almost like its protagonist in Ravana land.

 Hanuman?s average occupancy of 65 per cent at the city multiplexes in Week IV has been a revelation compared to Potter IV, whose collections dropped by 50 per cent from Day One to Day Seven, even as it smashed screen records in the US. Giving in to the Hanuman hysteria are schools like Abhinav Bharti and Mahadevi Birla, with students being taken in large groups to watch the movie.

 ?We have taken more than 1,000 of our students in batches of 250,? says Malini Bhagat, headmistress of Mahadevi Birla Girls? School. ?The kids have come back raving.?

 So how has the pint-sized Hanuman pushed back Pottermania? Kid power, say cine halls. Kids, after all, just want to have fun and Goblet is a bit too grim.

 ?The new Harry Potter movie is more serious and scary than the first three films, that were out-and-out fun fare for children,? feels INOX (City Centre) general manager Shubhashish Ganguly.

 A still from Potter IV: Cooling down 

?Hanuman, on the other hand, has picked up after a dull start and is now running house-full on Sunday mornings. Children have been howling on not getting tickets.?

 The merchandising around the movie, another first for Indian animation, has also helped. Says 89 Cinemas general manager Prashant Srivastava: ?We ran contests and gave out prizes like Hanuman gada, face mask, wind chime, parachute. Also, since it is mythology, even the elders are accompanying the children.?

 The fact that Hanuman bears a ?made-in-India? tag with the quality of animation matching up to the Shreks and Shark Tales is big plus.

 ?There has always been an interest in the animation space and now the children have an Indian character to identify with,? says Manas Malhotra, marketing manager of Percept Picture Company, the producers of the film. ?We have managed to garner more than Rs 8 crore in the first four weeks.?

 With talk of Hanuman 2 taking shape ? with just Hanuman the kid ? Team Harry is hoping the boy wizard works his magic at the box-office yet.

 ?It isn?t a disaster,? says Kushagra Jalan, Bengal distributor of Goblet. ?We are waiting for the school exams to get over and then we should see the ticket sales go up.?

Her favourite five

Screen On amp; Off

 She loves to portray ?complex emotions? on the screen because she feels ?life is really not that simple?. In all the good films she has done, the contribution of her directors has been ?phenomenal?. Every one of them, she feels, has ?a specialised technique of telling a story?. Having said all this, MANISHA KOIRALA (picture above by Aranya Sen captures a candid moment on the sets of Rituparno Ghosh?s Khela at Chalsa) picks her favourite five from a bunch of 60 films.

 1942 ? A Love Story

 Vidhu Vinod Chopra?s film was my first serious project. I had done only glamourous roles before that. 1942? was photographed very well and I have the best memories of this film. With the director, there was a good exchange of communication and friendship. I learnt what acting was all about while doing this film.

 Akele Hum Akele Tum

 Directed by Mansoor Khan, this film had a different kind of set-up. My role was different than what I had done before and the director wanted it to be portrayed differently. But he was always open to suggestions. 

 Bombay

 I loved the story, I loved each and every scene in the film and I loved my character. Bombay is an all-time favourite. It has such a unique blend of violence and romance. And besides, Mani Ratnam is a fabulous director. He takes real-life incidents and puts fictitious characters into them. The relationship between a man and a woman, between the old and the new generations came out very well in Bombay. Mani?s knowledge of music also helped the film.

 Dil Se

 Again a Mani Ratnam film, and I just loved it. I liked the concept of having a terrorist falling in love and being in a dilemma. My character was very subdued and understated. The reason Mani chose me for the role of Meghna was because I didn?t look like a terrorist.

 Khamoshi

 I love the Sanjay Leela Bhansali film (picture left) because of my role. The relationship between a daughter and her mute parents; the conflict between loving a child and also being jealous of her at the same time because she can sing and they can?t. It was all very complex.

 Scouting styles

IPSITA DEB

Celebrating Life, a fashion exhibition organised by 

the designers of tomorrow, kicked off on Tuesday morning. The fashion department 

at Bhawanipur Education Society College stepped beyond the confines of the run-of-the-mill 

ramp, with clothes draping interiors, sets and costumes also conceived by the 

final-year students.

 Its audience, too, is ?not the usual by-invitation-only? crowd. Just about anyone is welcome to walk in.

 ?The interiors, sets and even costumes were exclusively designed by the students,? explained honorary general secretary Heena Gorsia.

 This was a reflection of the spirit of the endeavour. ?We wanted to depict the changing lifestyles of the present generation. Fashion is the future ? not only for the young ? but for the whole universe,? added Gorsia.

 The venue is divided into 12 cubicles, each with a different theme and d?cor to match. Fashion Office cum Boutique, Discotheque, Tailor Shop, Photo Studio, Power Point (Movie Hall), Art Gallery, Coffee Bar, Hawker Shop, Bedroom and even Dyer Workshop are some of the chosen motifs.

 For an added touch, models wearing the student creations were seen manning the cubicles along with the budding designers.

 The outfits at this fashion display are both western and ethnic, mostly in linen, georgette, cotton, silk and crepe, with plenty of surface ornamentation and delicate use of embellishments.The fashion accessories were also theme-based, blending in with the respective cubicles. The clothes ranged from the traditional to the funky and contemporary. 

 The fashion wing of Bhawanipur College was started in 1994. While alumni Amitabh Damani and Preetam Panda have come up with their own labels, designer Chandni Gupta is supplying to Kyra. Tejas Gandhi, on the other hand, is now a renowned dress designer in Tollywood.

 Artist Piu Sarkar and designer Abhishek Dutta inaugurated the exhibition, which will be on till Wednesday evening.

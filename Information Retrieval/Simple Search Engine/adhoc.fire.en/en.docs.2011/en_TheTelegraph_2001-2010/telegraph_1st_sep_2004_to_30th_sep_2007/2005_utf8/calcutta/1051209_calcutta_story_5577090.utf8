 Another tot goes missing

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A two-and-a-half-year-old boy went missing from home in Narkeldanga, on Wednesday afternoon. The child could not be traced following the visit of a jaributiwali.

 The boy?s mother said she had allowed ?the jaributiwali? ? who had come armed with tabeez and other devices ? to take the child to her sister?s house in the neighbourhood. The tot hasn?t been seen since.

 ?We are looking at all angles. We are searching for the woman in question. We had also picked up the victim?s uncle for interrogation since there was some talk of family problems,? said Vinit Goyal, deputy commissioner, eastern suburban division.

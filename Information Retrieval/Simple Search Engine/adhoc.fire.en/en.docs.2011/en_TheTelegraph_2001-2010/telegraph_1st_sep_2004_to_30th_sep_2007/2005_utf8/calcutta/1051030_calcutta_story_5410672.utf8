 Kali Puja, Diwali, Bhai Phonta, Id and a birthday?thats the celebration line-up at Kewpies this coming week.

 ong with the regular a-la-carte menu, the Bengali speciality restaurant is offering an entire range of special festive fare that includes Jamjamat Thalas and Id platters. The must-haves on the menu are the Husseini Curry, Rakhis Kabiraji Cutlet, Pias Elish Paturi and Mitus Daab Jhinge.

 The Amish Jamjamat thala is priced at Rs 350 and the Niramish version comes for Rs 315. Two special Id platters are priced at Rs 270 and Rs 250. 

 Endings always call for sweet treats and the Patishapta and Komola Kheer are recommended. The festival is on from November 1 to 6.

 Having begun in a garage with four tables, its a great feeling to celebrate our seventh birthday. Though Kewpies has expanded its activities with the retail of our trademark spices, its time we opened shop outside Calcutta, says owner Rakhi Purnima Dasgupta.

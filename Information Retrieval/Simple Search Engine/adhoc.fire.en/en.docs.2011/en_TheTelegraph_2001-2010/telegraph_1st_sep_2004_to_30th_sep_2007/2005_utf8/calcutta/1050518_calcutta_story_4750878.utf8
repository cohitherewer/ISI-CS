 Gold shines brighter than ever for summer weddings

 SMITA ROY CHOWDHURY

 Diamonds may be a girls best friend and platinum may have found favour with most Hollywood beauties, but nothing beats the appeal of pure gold when it comes to jewellery shopping in our own city. 

 Diamonds are a hit in the trinket segment. Platinum is yet to catch the fancy of more than a few Calcutta women. So, gold continues to rule the racks in the heavy jewellery section.

 The demand for gold jewellery is increasing every year, especially when it comes to wedding jewellery. Diamonds are more popular for rings and pendants, but not too many people go for heavy diamond sets for wedding purposes. And the sale of platinum is not even comparable to these. It has a very select clientele that constitutes a rather small portion of our customer base, says Prosanto Chandra, deputy managing director, PC Chandra.

 Chandra attributes a lot of the popularity of gold ornaments to the enduring worth of the metal. I think apart from the beauty of the metal, what works for gold is its resale value. People think of gold as an investment. Though diamond too has very good resale value, most people are not aware of it, he adds.

 To cash in on the popularity of the yellow metal, the leading jewellery house is hosting an exhibition of pure gold ornaments between May 18 and 21 at all its showrooms across Calcutta. Called Swarna Mrigaya, the annual event targets the summer wedding season, a peak time for jewellery shopping in the city. A host of new designs in necklace sets, bangles, chains, rings and earrings have been specially created for the festival, which according to Chandra has been receiving an overwhelming response for the past five years. 

 People wait for Swarna Mrigaya throughout the year as we unveil a host of new designs during the event. Since we are targeting wedding shopping, we will display heavy jewellery starting from Rs 30,000 for the sets. The chains and individual rings and earrings are of course priced lower, reveals Chandra. Apart from new and unique designs, the festival also offers attractive schemes like assured gifts of gold and silver on every purchase and lucky draws with electronic gadgets as prizes.

 The designs to be unveiled this year include a lot of traditional filigree work as well as combinations of ethnic and western motifs. We have noticed that for wedding jewellery, people prefer a lot of filigree work and antique designs, whereas jewellery influenced by western designs sells well for other occasions, adds Chandra.

 Rising demand for gold jewellery has prompted PC Chandra to venture into the districts as well. While the chain has already set up shop in Siliguri, Malda and Burdwan, stores in a few other districts of Bengal are also on the cards. In fact, PC Chandra will soon be spreading its wings to Delhi, Bangalore and Bhubaneswar soon. 

 Five years ago, we just had four outlets in Calcutta. Now we have eight, including three in the districts. And in the next couple of years we will have another eight showrooms, including those in other metros, reveals Chandra. Our aim is to increase our market size and reach out to more categories. We get a lot of Bengali customers from Delhi and hence we would like to have our showroom there. Bhubaneswar and Bangalore are also very good markets. But we are not thinking of Mumbai right now since theres stiff competition in the jewellery market there.

 The decision to open shop at a particular location is guided by market research, which also dictates the kind of jewellery that will sell well in that place.

 Says Chandra: While Delhi and Bhubaneswar have markets very similar to Calcutta, in Bangalore we will stock a mix of modern and temple jewellery, which is the kind of ornament that goes down well in the south.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 You are a true optimist and believe in the essential goodness of all. If you really care for something, you will never settle for anything short of the best. Take the advice of experienced people before plunging into things. Your superiors appreciate your no-complaints and ever-ready-to-work attitude. Do not worry about finances; things always do work out. ? Kusum Bhandari

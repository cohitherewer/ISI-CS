 Lara Dutta: Hair and now

 She?s been a Miss Universe, she?s now got a Bollywood hit under her belt and she?s also set to fight tobacco in a forthcoming movie set in Calcutta. In the middle of all that jazz, Lara Dutta, seen recently in the hit comedy No Entry, has been picked as the new Pantene brand ambassador.

 With this new campaign, Lara joins Pantene?s illustrious league of celebrity endorsers of the country including Katrina Kaif, Bipasha Basu, Shilpa Shetty, Sonali Bendre and Simone Singh. 

 And Lara is all charged up about her new assignment. ?I am delighted to be the face of the world?s number one shampoo, which is the perfect solution for people like me who are constantly on the move and have little or no time for regular oiling,? she said.

 The Pantene people are equally ecstatic. According to Rahul Malhotra, associate marketing director of Procter amp; Gamble: ?Pantene has always believed that only hair that is strong from inside looks beautiful from the outside. Likewise, Lara is a beauty icon who radiates inner strength too.? 

 Pijush and Anusree in Antony Firingi: Return route

 Uttam Kumar is all over TV, thanks to the Bengali channels that are dishing out a spate of remakes. Latest in the line is Antony Firingi. Here, Pijush Ganguly does an Uttam Kumar, with Kharaj Mukherjee essaying the role of Bhola Moira and Anusree Das doing a Tanuja-like Soudamini.

 Though the telefilm ? directed by John, who had earlier adapted Devdas for the small screen ? borrows heavily from the 70s superhit, some amount of research has gone into recreating the legend of Antony Kabiyal.

 To start with, the memorable music of the film has been replaced with some new scores though retaining the original flavour. The new lyrics by Sushil Majumder have been set to tune by Manab Mukherjee. Pijush has sung four tracks and Kharaj has lent his voice to Bhola Moira. 

 And both the actors have playbacked before ? Kharaj for Kaushik Ganguly?s Shunya e Buke and more, and Pijush for Raja Dasgupta?s telefilm Anyo Nakshi. The kobir ladai, which features Bhola Moira and Antony Firingi in a duel of words, retains some of the film?s lyrics. 

 Antony Firingi will be aired from Mahalaya at 7 pm on Akash.

 With Durga puja around the corner, Discovery Channel is airing The Goddess With Feet Of Clay, that chronicles the preparation for the annual ritual for Bengalis. 

 The focus is not on the well-decorated pandals or the joy that surrounds the festival, but the making of the idol and the dedication of the artistes at one of Calcutta?s oldest families, that of Krishna Deb. The Debs celebrate the festival in the most traditional style every year.

 There?s also a look at Kumartuli, where the artisans have their hands full during this period, catering to orders from across the city and also from around the world. The programme shows how they work against time fighting all odds to create the perfect Durga.

 The Goddess With Feet Of Clay airs on September 24 from 8 pm.

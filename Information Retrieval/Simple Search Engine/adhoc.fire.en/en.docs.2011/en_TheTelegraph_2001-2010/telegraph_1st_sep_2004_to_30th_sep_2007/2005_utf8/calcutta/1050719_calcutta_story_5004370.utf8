The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 ?Now, I can carry off anything?

 From kick-ass action to soft sentimentality, 

 SHILPA SHETTY is doing it all and enjoying every bit of it. 

 She tells Pratim D. Gupta about the storm of Dus, 

 the lull of Fareb, and the future

 ?Getting the look 

 of the character right is like half the job done in 

 a film,? feels Shilpa Shetty 

 Out of nowhere, you come and 

 rock everyone with two back-to-back releases, Fareb and 

 Dus. Was it a planned assault?

 (Laughs) No, no, I didn?t 

 plan any release date. The releases were not intended to 

 come at the same time. But the best thing about the two 

 was that the roles were diametrically opposite to each other. 

 While Dus proved that I could carry off an action-oriented 

 role, Fareb saw me in that typical strong Indian 

 housewife mould.

 And how did you manage to stand 

 out in the heap of 10?

 (Giggles) Yes, I have been 

 getting huge compliments from critics and fans. For me, 

 it was just great to share the same frame with such good-looking 

 men like Sanju (Sanjay Dutt) and Zayed (Khan). And then 

 there?s someone like Abhi (Abhishek Bachchan), who has women 

 swooning all over him. So standing with them in the same 

 scenes was quite a task in itself. And now everyone is saying 

 I stood out in Dus...

 What kind of preparation did 

 you take to get into the all-out action mode?

 I have always believed that for 

 any role, the look should work out. Then, half your battle 

 is won. So I sat down with (director) Anubhav (Sinha) and 

 worked on how Aditi should look in the film. We came up 

 with the high ponytail look that gave my overall appearance 

 a bit of toughness. Then the attitude was very aggressive 

 and carefree. All of that came together and translated effectively 

 on screen.

 And what about the stunning 

 stunts?

 There?s just that one kick basically 

 which has got people gawking. I feel what made the role 

 special was that it was very heroic. It gave me a slight 

 edge. During the pre-climax, when I tell Ansari that he 

 has just two choices, I thought those were lines written 

 for a hero to mouth. I never felt that I was playing just 

 another character in the film.

 But you never felt any insecurity 

 in sharing space with so many?

 Not for a moment. Dus was 

 my first multi-starrer and the reason I did the film was 

 that I knew I had a good role. The length of a film role 

 has never mattered for me. It was just good to be part of 

 a film like Dus, which has turned out to be the most 

 stylish action film in Indian cinema.

 Fareb didn?t do as well 

 but you got to act alongside sister Shamita?

 I would call Fareb a unique 

 experience. I can?t describe in words how strongly I feel 

 about the film. Sharing screen space with Shamita was a 

 very proud moment for me. And although we didn?t have many 

 scenes together, we were together on the sets for different 

 sequences. So we got to bond a lot during the shooting. 

 It was just fantastic.

 Why aren?t you signing new 

 films?

 I am taking it really easy now. 

 I have worked very hard for the past several months and 

 I even have another release, a Kannada film, coming up. 

 I want to be really convinced before I take up a new project. 

 I am listening to a lot of scripts but haven?t said yes 

 to any, yet.

 There was talk of you doing 

 Bengali films. What happened to that?

 I was offered a couple of Bengali 

 films some time back but a lot of Hindi film work at that 

 time didn?t allow me to take up the offers. I would love 

 to do a Bengali film. I feel they are truly rich and technically 

 brilliant too. So, if now someone comes up to me with a 

 meaningful Bengali script, I will definitely do it.

 How do you plan to balance 

 your commercial and arty assignments?

 People thought that after Phir 

 Milenge I would only do arthouse cinema. But I again 

 changed tracks... I like surprising everyone. Many critics 

 were disappointed with Khamosh but I look at the 

 film as an artiste and I have no regrets in doing it. I 

 am enjoying what I am doing. Now I can say I can carry off 

 anything. And I am proud to say that without sounding pompous. 

 But now it will be tough to reinvent myself again.

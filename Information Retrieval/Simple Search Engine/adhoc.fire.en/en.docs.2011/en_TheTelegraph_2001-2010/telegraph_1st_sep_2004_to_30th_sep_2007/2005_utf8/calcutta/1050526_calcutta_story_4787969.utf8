 Dancing around trees with a soul

 In town as Ashoke Ganguli for Mira 

 Nairs The Namesake, Irrfan tells Pratim D. 

 Gupta that he may not be able to change the film industry 

 but he will be doing movies all his life

 From giving new meaning to Macbeth 

 in and as Maqbool to standing out as the lone ranger 

 in a commercial skin fest like Rog, you expect Irrfan 

 to spring a surprise every time he surfaces on screen. He 

 may be doing a Rs 40 crore international film by Mira Nair 

 but that won?t stop him from dwelling on his favourite episode 

 of STAR Bestsellers on the small screen. Bizarre 

 and brilliant, you have to give it to the man who doesn?t 

 hesitate for a moment to think aloud: ?Why would Rituparno 

 Ghosh cast me? He works with stars.?

 The man who has now evolved into 

 the alternative face of Indian cinema incidentally started 

 out in a bit part in Mira?s Salaam Bombay, almost 

 two decades ago. ?I was too naive then. I was just another 

 young actor of NSD (National School of Drama) and it was 

 her first film too. When she got in touch with me a couple 

 of months back for The Namesake, she told me, ?I 

 owed you a role and here it goes?.?

 And so Irrfan became Ashoke Ganguli, 

 a character so Bengali that he found himself completely 

 stumped. ?I couldn?t imagine that the role would turn out 

 to be so challenging for me. There?s something so peaceful 

 about him. I have never come across a guy like this who 

 deals with every situation in such a unique manner. His 

 rhythm is so very Bengali. He would eat his lunch and take 

 a nap for two hours in the afternoon. Now I can?t 

 do that. My whole day will be spoiled.?

 So was it a bout of method acting, 

 which saved the day? ?I don?t understand method acting,? 

 pat comes the confession. ?My method is trial and error. 

 I try and apply myself to the script and to react to it 

 instinctively. The role should inspire me to act and then 

 I would discover my own way of handling it. For Ashoke, 

 getting the feel right was very, very difficult. In fact, 

 I am still discovering him.?

 More than anything else, the language 

 was a big challenge for the actor who?s successfully tweaked 

 his twang for linguistically diverse films ? from the feudal 

 dialect of The Warrior to the Allahabadi accent of 

 Haasil. ?Mira wanted Bengali-accented English. Then 

 again, it couldn?t be heavily accented or the Western audiences 

 of the film would be alienated. There should just be a hint 

 of Bengali. It was not possible to get it right in just 

 10 days. That my wife is Bengali did help to some extent.?

 But Irrfan?s still got good things 

 to say about his tough taskmaster. ?When I saw Monsoon 

 Wedding, I realised how much Mira had matured as a director. 

 She has become so comfortable with the craft and the language 

 that she can now experiment and play around with the film 

 medium. What?s quite incredible is the amount of shooting 

 she is able to extract in a day. She has almost mastered 

 the craft of shooting lots in lesser number of days. Who 

 can imagine that a film like Namesake can be shot 

 in just nine weeks??

 Once the remaining two of those 

 nine weeks are taken care of in Calcutta, Irrfan is slated 

 to plunge into the role of a sharebroker in Naseeruddin 

 Shah?s directorial debut from July. ?Finally, I will get 

 to act with my favourite actress, Konkona Sen Sharma. I 

 think she?s tremendous.?

 Remind Irrfan about Anjan Dutt?s 

 project with him and Rahul Bose, and he sets the record 

 straight. ?He (Anjan) still hasn?t made the film? I liked 

 the script and wanted to do the role which he wanted somebody 

 else to play. The role he offered me didn?t offer any new 

 challenge for me... I would like to do a full Bengali film, 

 though. It would be really interesting.?

 Really interesting is how one 

 would define Irrfan?s shooting diary. From small roles in 

 commercial potboilers like Rokra and Chocolate 

 to a television film like 7 ? Phere to Aditya 

 Bhattacharya?s Dubai Return, the mix borders on the 

 maddening. ?I don?t want to be settled somewhere. I know 

 I won?t change the film industry. I don?t even know how 

 they are going to use me in the future. All I know is that 

 I?ll be doing films all my life.?

 Talking about films, who are his 

 favourite actors? Trust Irrfan to trek way off the beaten 

 track ? Chhabi Biswas and Hrithik Roshan. ?Hrithik?s one 

 daring guy ? he changed the way heroes danced in the film 

 industry.? And would Irrfan ever be caught moving to the 

 Bollywood beat? ?I don?t mind dancing around trees, but 

 they should have a soul!?

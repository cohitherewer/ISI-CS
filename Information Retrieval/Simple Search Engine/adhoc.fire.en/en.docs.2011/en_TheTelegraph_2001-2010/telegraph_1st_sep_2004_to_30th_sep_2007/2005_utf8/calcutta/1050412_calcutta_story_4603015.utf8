 Eighty-four events in Calcutta and its neighbouring 

districts, influencing 11,000 people over two months. Not mission impossible, 

but mission accomplished. On April 9, the young crusaders involved in making the 

campaign a success were rewarded for their efforts. The theme was HIV/AIDS awareness, 

and scores of school and college students pitched in to spread the word.

 Thoughtshop Foundation, in association with the State AIDS Prevention and Control Society and Balmer Lawrie amp; Co Ltd, instituted the Youth Awards for Social Initiatives to honour outstanding efforts by youth groups to deal with important social issues. The theme for 2004-2005 was HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention.

 The competition began in October last year when Thoughtshop Foundation held workshops with 34 youth groups and provided training to the participants. Over 60 teams representing colleges and youth networks were formed. Nearly 1,500 youngsters were involved. 

 At the next stage, the teams planned their events in consultation with Thoughtshop Foundation and submitted their proposals. Once they were approved, Stage III kicked off. Between January and March, over 350 youths in 24 teams spread awareness through street plays, interactive workshops, competitions at schools and colleges, surveys, discussions, quizzes, debates, film screenings, jatras, magic shows, rallies and condom promotions to name a few, using art and technology.

 These were monitored and judged by a panel. The teams started implementing their proposals on December 1, World AIDS Day. The teams roped in their families, colleges, gram panchayats, police, cable operators, shop-owners and NGOs. They targeted schools, colleges (including college fests and science fairs), para clubs, railway, bus and Metro stations, popular public venues, street corners, theatres, shopping malls, rural market places, village squares, slum settlements and even went door to door. One group convinced a body of Muslim religious leaders to address the issue. 

 The college team of the year went to an 11-member team from JU called AID for AIDS. This team was also the only one to organise a condom promotion during the annual college fest. The runner-up was also from JU, called The Saviours, which used street plays as the medium. 

 The joint winners of the youth initiative of the year award in the youth group category were Ramnarayanpur Kalika Sangha (based in South 24-Parganas), who conducted 17 activities and reached out to over 2,500 people, and Mayurbhanj Joint Citizen Centre (based in Ekbalpore) who held seminars with religious leaders.

 The team that won the award for working against all odds was the two-member team Pratyay. The youngest motivated team award went to the Indiranagar and Metropally team of the Dum Dum Cantonment, 13-18 year-olds dwelling along railway lines.They organised candlelit rallies and distributed leaflets to railway passengers. Phoenix from St Thomas College bagged commendation for making good use of technology. 

 The awards for the team with most variety and the team with excellent skills in conducting workshops went to Rishi Bankim Chandra College, Naihati, and Baruipur College, respectively. 

 Barackpur Rashtra Guru Surendranath College was judged the best team with coordinated team effort. Wigan and Leigh College won for use of imaginative interactive method, St Xavier?s College for reaching out to a wide range of audiences, Jayprakash Institute for Social Change for consistent and serious work.

 Astha from Vidyasagar School of Social Work was the team which effectively used cultural performances on World AIDS Day. Youth for Development was the consistently well-organised youth group. Manoranjan Palli supported by Lutheran World Service was the team which effectively mobilised community resources. 

 Thoughtshop Foundation will organise this event again next year, in collaboration with National Service Scheme.

An absurd festival

 Gear up for a festival that celebrates all that is absurd. The Creative Commune will kick off The Absurd Festival on April 13, with an exhibition at Oxford Bookstore, as well as a theatre performance. ?There will be lots of music and it will be very physical,? explained Nandini Das, the festival coordinator. 

 The idea is to celebrate the untraditional themes in theatre. ?The absurd has no rules, it defies logic, thereby giving complete creative license to the performers to get the message across,? adds Nandini. Case in point: the play Rhinoceros by Eugene Ionesco, where people suddenly transform into animals. ?It allows serious issues to be illustrated in a wild way. It?s incongruous, which is why it?s so appealing.?

 The two-month showcase event will culminate on June 13 with a panel discussion on theme of the absurd in theatre. In between, three films ? Mr Bean, Pink Floyd?s The Wall and Tom Stoppard?s Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead ? will be held at Caffeine, on Elgin Road. Workshops will be held by Sohini Haldar of Nandikar, while mime and theatre groups will be guest performers through the festival. On May 13, Samuel Beckett?s Waiting For Goddot will be staged at Gyan Manch.

 The highlight of the event will be an inter-college festival, with around 20 colleges participating over 10 days. Two half-hour plays will be performed every evening. The scripts can be original or adapted, in English, Hindi or Bengali. 

 Catch all the action starting this Wednesday.

 Private eyes

 Feluda might have been flummoxed a few days ago by a robbery at his residence, off-screen, but the reel-detective has inspired many children over the years to become real life sleuths. Feluda, Sherlock Holmes, Miss Marple, Hercule Poirot and Byomkesh Bakshi are household names, who have enthralled readers with their intelligence and skills, inspiring others to follow in their footsteps. But there has always been a gap between literature and reality. 

 Not anymore. The Anapol Group of Services has come up with a three-month course to train future detectives. ?This is the first-of-its-kind course in eastern India,? said S.R. Banerjee, founder-director of Anapol Services. 

 The tricks written about in books rarely help in real life. A meticulous study reveals several unscientific methods used to catch criminals. Training and a bit of field experience is necessary to become a good detective. So, the course is divided into theory and practical classes. 

 But what are the prerequisites? ?Nothing very extraordinary. A Class XII passout, mature, intelligent, bold and most importantly, must have their wits about them,? added Banerjee, who served in the Calcutta Police force for 15 years before establishing Anapol. These kinds of courses are conducted in countries like the UK and the US, by the International Professional Security Association, of which Anapol Services is a member. 

 Students will be trained in aspects like verifying the antecedents of brides/ grooms, solving cases on post-marriage disputes, missing or murder links, gathering information on spurious items and smuggling, identifying fingerprints and handwritings and more. For field experience, the students will be sent out with sleuths of Anapol. 

 The job of a private detective is different from that of the police in many ways. They cannot seize material or make arrests. After the investigation is over, they will have to furnish their clients with evidence. If any arrest is made, it will be done by the police. Also, the police have the backing of a huge force. Private eyes have to work individually or in small groups. 

 So, what?s the risk factor? There is some, but as Banerjee said: ?The moment you realise you have even one per cent risk and have drawn the attention of the offender, back away. It is impossible to solve a case if the wrong-doer realises he is under scrutiny.?

 After receiving your certificate from Anapol, there is a whole range of options. Anapol has already trained a group of two girls and three boys. ?At present, all of them are working with us. But I have suggested they open agencies of their own and work independently. More and more people nowadays prefer private detectives to police. And there is dearth of good private eyes. I know a few who earn up to Rs 30,000 a month,? summed up Banerjee. 

 The course costs Rs 6,000. If that?s your calling, contact Anapol at 2/1 Loudon Street.

Although March 25 was Holi, the festive fever had 

started the day before at Nazrul Mancha, the venue for the annual social celebration 

by Sammilani Maha vidyalaya. With rain playing spoilsport, the programme was delayed 

by two hours. It was inaugurated by principal M.N. Sen, and followed by a classical 

dance by students. Suman Mitra, a second-year B.Com (hons) student, then tickled 

the funny bone with his wit. Students regaled the auditorium with song and dance. 

After solo performer Shoumik, guest bands Cactus and Fossils rocked the auditorium. 

The grand finale was a riot of colours. Sammilani Utsav ?05, in memory of Amitava 

Nandi, ex-general secretary of the college, will donate the funds raised from 

the concert to the Chief Minister?s Fund for Thalassaemia patients. Hence, the 

tagline of the concert ? Band 2 Aid.

Two more college fests were held in the city recently. 

On April 1 was Willowz ?05, organised by the students of Techno India Institute 

of Technology. Apart from various competitions held at the institute?s first fest, 

Bangla band Cactus ended the evening. 

 Vivekananda College held its annual social, Falguni 2005 last month. Singer Shilajit tried to portray the canvas of a Bengali village through his songs. Once again, Cactus ended the event on a musical note, with a fusion of Bengali songs and Baul gaan.

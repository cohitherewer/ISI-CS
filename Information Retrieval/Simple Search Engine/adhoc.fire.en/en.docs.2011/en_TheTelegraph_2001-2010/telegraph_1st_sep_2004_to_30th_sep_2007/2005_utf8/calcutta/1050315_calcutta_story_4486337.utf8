Iron intrigue

Wrought iron furniture rules when it comes 

to doing up interiors of getaway homes, finds Himika Chaudhuri 

Wrought iron may not have the class advantage, but 

it has always fared well on the chic and trendy scales. The black sleek frames 

coupled with bright upholstery for cushions, tablecloths or bedspreads, add youth 

and vibrancy to any room.

The look is still in vogue, and it has spread its 

influence from small apartments to the sprawling interior spaces of leisure spots 

on the city outskirts.

As more and more people opt for a second home for 

a weekend getaway in the form of either a country house or a cosy cottage, wrought 

iron furniture is taking over, allowing owners to keep to a modest budget and 

ensuring low maintenance over the years.

Leisure spots

?We are doing up interiors of a few bungalows near 

Vidyasagar Setu and wrought iron is the hot favourite in furniture,? reveals Indranil 

Dey of Irony, a wrought iron furniture company. It?s the sense of space provided 

by wrought iron that makes it a big hit for getaway homes, he adds.

?Iron has a very playful and casual feel that adds 

to the relaxed setting of a country home,? feels interior designer Manjari Sahai.

That?s why the pieces are popular for informal areas 

of the home like the veranda or lounge.

Its advantages over wooden furniture, besides being 

easier on the pocket, are low maintenance and easy transportation. ?Even if you 

leave a piece of wrought iron furniture without spending any time or money on 

maintenance for five years, it will still look as good as new,? adds Dey. This 

makes it a favourite for restaurants as well.

Best buys

Furniture designers are innovating to create multipurpose 

pieces. Take for instance the layered dining table meant for those with a small 

dining space. A glass layer underneath the tabletop can be used to store the food 

bowls during meals to avoid clutter. The usual range of beds, dining sets and 

living room furniture is available at most stores.

Add-ons

Furniture can also be teamed with accessories made 

from the same material. The options extend much beyond candlestands ? from stylish 

hooks that can hold anything from wall hangings to your tennis racket, to shelves 

that can be placed across a wall to be loaded with knick knacks. Some brands are 

even coming up with window grills.

Colour code

The brighter the better is the mantra when it comes 

to dressing up wrought iron furniture. ?Since the frame is usually black, it provides 

an excellent base for the use of bright colours in upholstery,? adds interior 

designer Gopa Ray. The latest trend in furnishings is loud and vibrant. ?We even 

get orders for cushions in two different colours for chairs of the same set,? 

adds Dey.

Price points

From Rs 500 for a medium-sized round table for the 

living room to fancy dining sets worth thousands, you can find something for every 

budget. Most well known brands also offer packages for the entire house, starting 

at about Rs 35,000. Price depends on the fineness of the metal and intricacy of 

work.

 Fogging harmful and ineffective 

 Baby De: What steps have you taken to check the spread of dengue? Why isn?t intensive fogging being done in the city?

 Let me make it very clear that outdoor fogging is useless and harmful. It only sends mosquitoes and clouds of organo-phosphorus compounds into your house.

 Fogging works only on mosquitoes who can?t fly elsewhere to save themselves. To control dengue and malaria, we have to control the mosquito population at the larvae stage, when the insects are wing-less and vulnerable.

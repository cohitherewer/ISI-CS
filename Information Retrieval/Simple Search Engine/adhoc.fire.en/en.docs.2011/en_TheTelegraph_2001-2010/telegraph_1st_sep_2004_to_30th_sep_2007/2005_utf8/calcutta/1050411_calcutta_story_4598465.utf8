The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Labourers unloading iron rods and scrap during peak hours in front of roadside 

shops on APC Road, Amherst Street and Nirmal Chandra Dey Street cause much inconvenience 

to the pedestrians. Sensing the danger, children and elderly people avoid the 

pavement when the loading and unloading is in progress. The iron rods jut out 

of the shops and the vehicles used to transport the material obstruct traffic. 

Loading and unloading of construction material in bulk should be restricted to 

early morning or afternoon or late at night.

 Metro Railway does not run trains on Sundays till 3 pm. As a number of offices 

of private companies keep open on Sundays, it will be of immense help to the office-goers 

if the trains are operated on Sundays as well. The frequency can be reduced, so 

that the company doesn?t incur losses due to the absence of the weekday rush. 

 Debaprasad Mukherjee, Nayapatty Road. 

 All the meat shops, on the 10-km stretch from Jinjira bazar to Pujali thermal 

power station, display trunks of slaughtered cows and goats in a horrendous manner, 

much to the disgust of passers-by. Will the local administration please take steps 

so that we do not have to witness the gory sight? 

 Govinda Bakshi, Budge Budge.

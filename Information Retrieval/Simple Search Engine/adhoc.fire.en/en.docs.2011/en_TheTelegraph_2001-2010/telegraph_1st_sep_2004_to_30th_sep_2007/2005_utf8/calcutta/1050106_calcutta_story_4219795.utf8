The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Screen On amp; Off

 They haven?t yet come together on the big screen but you can catch the Bachchans at their bindaas best on your television this Friday as they face Karan Johar?s barrage of questions on Koffee with Karan. What makes this the most anticipated of the caffeine t?te-?-t?tes is the level of candidness that the father-son duo brings to the show. 

 So when Karan asks the dad, ?How does it feel to have the most eligible bachelor at home??, before Bachchan senior can answer, Abhishek chips in: ?Why don?t I hear of all these girls who find me hot??

 Filled with magic moments galore, this special episode even has the father playing moral guardian to his son on air. When Karan asks Abhishek, ?What part of a woman turns you on the most??, the Chhota B answers, ?Her eyes?. Immediately, Amitabh warns his son: ?Don?t you dare go any lower!? 

 And then there is the action-packed rapid fire round which reveals all: Who would Abhishek choose between Preity and Rani? And who would Amitabh choose between Kajol and Rani?

 If that?s not enough, there are some answers to real questions too: What was the impact of the Karisma break-up on Abhishek? Who is Abhishek really seeing?

 So this Friday, the parties can wait. Just plant yourself in front of the telly for a kadak Koffee with Karan. STAR World, 10 pm.

 The Bachchans with Karan Johar: It doesn?t get bigger than this

 After the critically acclaimed Haasil and Charas, director Tigmanshu Dhulia has recently started his own production house called Fish Films. Their maiden venture is a telefilm for the Studio One slot of STAR One.

 Titled Woh Dus Din, the 75-minute comedy is set against the backdrop of Bollywood and is about a production team needing to complete a film shoot in 10 days after the negatives get burnt.

 ?I thought I?ll direct our first production. From now on, my colleagues can direct other ventures. We?ll also get into film production soon,? Dhulia told Metro.

 As for his filmography, Dhulia is slated to direct two ventures for Raj Kumar Santoshi. ?One is a political drama and the other a comedy. We are still at the scripting stage,? he signed off.

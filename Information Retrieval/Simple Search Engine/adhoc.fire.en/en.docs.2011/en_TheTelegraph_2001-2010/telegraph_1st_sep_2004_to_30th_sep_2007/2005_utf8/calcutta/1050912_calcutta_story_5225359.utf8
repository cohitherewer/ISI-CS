The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 A few days back, on a bus to Khardah on route 78, I saw a little boy carrying 

another child of four on his back, haversack fashion. The little thing clung to 

the elder boy?s neck. Their mother stood at the other end. They quite obviously 

belonged to a family of workers, the kind that abounds in the Titagarh-Belgharia 

industrial belt. The elder brother showed the younger one?s legs which looked 

withered. The boy said they were too weak for him to stand. He affirmed that it 

was polio and said they lived in Khardah. But he was not aware of the any of the 

facilities that the government supposedly provides for handicapped people. And 

there was good reason for this too. The campaigns are only aimed at the literate. 

He did not know that special seats are provided for the handicapped in buses and 

the conductor never bothered to show him the seat. Is the government aware of 

such stray cases of polio? Or will it choose to notice only when there is an epidemic?

 The tram tracks from Raja Dinendra Street up to the Maniktala crossing have 

been concretised on a war footing. However, the adjoining thoroughfare has been 

left with huge potholes. The inconvenience caused to motorists transpires in frequent 

traffic snarls on the stretch. The Corporation should repair the road immediately. 

 Kalyan Ray Chaudhuri, Maniktala. 

 Bsnl?s offer of broadband connection for Rs 250 has made the facility very 

affordable for the middle class. Students can also avail of the facility for greater 

access to the Internet for their academic purposes.

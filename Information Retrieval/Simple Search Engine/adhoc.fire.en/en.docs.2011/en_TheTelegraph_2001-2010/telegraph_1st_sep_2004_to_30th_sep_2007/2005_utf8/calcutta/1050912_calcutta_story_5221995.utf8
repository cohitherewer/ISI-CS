The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Flight of fancy

 Evoking the sensuous joy of travelling on a tranquil yet lively aerial journey, the paintings of Arindam Chatterjee are deeply suggestive of the merging of the real world with the sub-conscious depths of our minds. The Airborne Stories, his current series of works on show, has a definite dream-like quality. Characterised by spatial and colour structures, bound within an internal harmony, the paintings appear to be full of feeling, but are unable to express themselves clearly like thoughts in a dream. Chatterjee handles wide spaces on large-sized frames to create an impression of a cosmic void on which float fluid forms and shapes, exuding a flood of moods, meanings and memories. What is interesting about his works is that his compositions, no matter how abstract, are not entirely devoid of references to objects and ideas of the visual world.

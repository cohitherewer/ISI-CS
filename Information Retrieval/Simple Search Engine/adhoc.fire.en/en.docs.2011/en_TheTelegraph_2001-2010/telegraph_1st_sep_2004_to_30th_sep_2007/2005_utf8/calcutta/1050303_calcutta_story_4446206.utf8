 CIMA Gallery?s latest exhibition entitled Tradition in Modernity, focuses on five artists, whose work may break or bend the rules that have been passed down the generations but never really deviates from their confines. 

 The five artists are Ramananda Bandyopadhyay and Lalu Prosad Shaw from Calcutta, T. Vaikuntam, Jyoti Bhatt and Haku Shah. The last two artists are from Gujarat, but while Bhatt?s work is seen from time to time at various exhibitions, Haku Shah?s work is rarely seen here. 

 However, in 1960, when he used to work at the Weavers Centre on Chittaranjan Avenue, he belonged to the Calcutta Painters and had exhibited at Ashoka Gallery in Theatre Road along with Paritosh Sen and Rathin Maitra.

 Haku Shah, like KG Subramanyan and Swaminathan, is known for his work with craftspeople, artisans, architects and others involved in creating concepts and designs. His medium is oil on canvas.

 His paintings are focused on figures, and despite his experiment with form the overriding impression is that of contemplative calm, often tinged with melancholy. They are also idyllic, insofar as they depict pastoral scenes, many of them related to Krishnalila or the ballads of the great Sufi poets and our very own Kabir and Rabi Das.

 Haku Shah?s soothing palette of yellow ochre, brown, green, black and earth colours is applied with a knife, creating a thin, unblemished skin of pigment. Sometimes, though, he uses more strident shades of red and yellow and midnight blue but these could have been inspired by our traditional miniature paintings.

 Jyoti Bhatt creates complex designs by using motifs and patterns from folk traditions, the famous cross stitch embroidery of Saurashtra, rangoli, impressions of hand and feet and calligraphic ideogram. 

 He is alive to the irony of exploiting tradition in a contemporary situation.

 We find this sensibility in the works of Vaikuntam and Lalu Shaw. The latter?s work depicting a man carrying the head of his beloved as if it were the most natural thing to do, can be quite subversive. 

 He gives a wicked twist to the fantasy element in his paintings. Vaikuntam takes similar liberties with the limbs of his bedizened men and women.

 Ramananda was trained by the masters of the Bengal school. His paintings have a certain charm. 

 They hark back to more decorative times and are executed with rare skill and finesse. Such expertise may become a thing of the past in a few decades? time.

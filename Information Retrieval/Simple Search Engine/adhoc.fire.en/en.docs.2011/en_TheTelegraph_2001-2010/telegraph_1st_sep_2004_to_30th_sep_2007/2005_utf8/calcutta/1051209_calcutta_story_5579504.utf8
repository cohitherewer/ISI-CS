 Schools flaunt facilities at fair

 Various schools showcased their infrastructure and facilities at the India and International Premier Schools Exhibition (IIPSE), held from December 3 to 5 at the Ice Skating Rink. 

 Apart from 30 schools, the event witnessed participation from playschools and Montessories as well.

 Participants said that most parents who had visited their stalls were very particular about the add-on facilities in the institutions.

 ?The situation has changed. These days parents look for better infrastructure and security in the school, and stress on all-round personality development of the child. Academics, of course, is also a major factor during admissions,? said Ranjan Mitter, principal of The Future Foundation School, at the fair. Regular play hours, spacious classrooms and a rich art gallery on the campus were high on its list of haves.

 Teachers of most participating schools were present at the stalls to interact with the parents. 

 ?I am scouting for a school for my child that has good sports facilities, serves good food and is security-conscious,? said Sourav Chowdhury. 

 He added that such fairs should be held in the city every year so that parents ?don?t have to make compromises and panic at the last minute to get their kids admitted to good schools?.

 ?We had organised many career fairs in the past, but we thought there was a need to provide a platform for the schools as well,? said Sanjeev Bolia, CEO of Afairs, the organisers of IIPSE.

 Among the schools from outside India present at the fair was Bhavan?s Indian International Schools, Singapore. ?We have students from Mumbai and Delhi, but not from Calcutta. Our main aim here is to introduce the school to this city,? said Neetu Mehta, head of communications and overseas admissions, Bhavan?s Indian International Schools.

 Heritage and Pailan featured in the line-up of city schools in IIPSE. Indranil Mukherjee, system administrator of Heritage School, said, ?We are a day boarding school. The students stay with us from 7.30 am to 4.30 pm. Hence, mostly it?s working parents who opt to enrol their kids with us.

 ?The footfall through the three days of the fair was around 5,000,? said Bolia, adding that there were plans to make the exhibition an annual affair.

 Creative best

 Abhivyakti, the inter-school fest at The Heritage School held on November 25 and 26, was a resounding success.

 A total of 12 city schools and over 600 students of classes III to VI took part in 17 events organised over the two days (picture above by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya).

 Other than the host school, Calcutta Boys?, DPS Ruby Park, Apeejay, South Point, Birla High (boys), Akshar, Ballygunge Siksha Sadan, M.B. Girls? and Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy (IICP) were among the participants.

 The first day saw an array of creative events like Nisarga (drawing competition), Nokshi (collage), Abhivyakti (mime) and Sargam (medley of folk songs). Youthful exuberance shone through on the second day through unique and thrilling events like Shark Tail (water sports), Mathemagic and Shinjini, a song and dance extravaganza.

 Painter Wasim Kapoor and members of Bhoomi were on the panel of judges for various events.

 South Point and Heritage emerged the best of the lot with the maximum number of prizes.

 Abhivyakti was a unique experience because a lot of thinking and innovation had gone into conceptualising, designing and organising the contests. Barry O? Brien was the chief guest at the awards ceremony.

 Winning verses

 Whoever thought that English poetry in the city had taken a beating was in for a refreshing revelation at Lanes and By-Lanes, presented by Dialogue, Oxford Bookstore, and alternative theatre group Best of Kolkata Campus, in association with Red Molecule, on November 25.

 A motley group of young poets at Oxford Bookstore, backed by theatre personality Parnab Mukherjee, decided to change the script that poetry in Calcutta ends with Wordsworth. Original recordings of T.S. Eliot and Robert Frost and Parnab?s take on the struggle of the last five hours of Jibanananda Das?s life at Sambhunath Pandit Hospital left the audience in awe.

 Joie Chatterjee?s confessions on silence was taken a step forward by fellow Xavieran Tina Ganguly?s subtly stinging tales of lives long spent and dreams half dreamt in On a Chandelier and Tribute to the love song of J.Alfred Prufock.

 Quaint and original melodies by Pritam, Shahana, Mrihna and composer Inam struck the right note. Shaurya Sircar of Jadavpur University gathered sights and smells from the lanes and bylanes of our vehemently hated and irresistibly loved city.

 ?Asta runs over the broken street, the bullet unfolds like an old carpet?, this was the turn of Inam Hussain Mullick to singe all senses with strong symbolic imagery.

 And when there gathers a group of people ready to listen and understand, should one not seize the chance to tell tales as they ought to be told? This was the impetus behind presenting an abridged version of Scream, an original performance play on child sexual abuse, by Parnab.

 The City Diary

 Two men in their thirties lost their lives to rash driving in different parts 

of the city on Sunday. 

 A 35-year-old pillion-rider was killed after being hit by a minibus near Tallah 

Bridge. The bus, plying on the Howrah-Nimta route, was speeding past a private 

bus on route 202. The motorcycle was caught in between the buses. 

 While Rajesh Shaw succumbed to his injuries at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, 

Nar Singh Jaiswal is battling for his life. He has been shifted to a private nursing 

home. A resident of 11/B, Samar Sarani, under Tallah police station, Rajesh was 

flung a few yards by the impact of the collision. 

 The two vehicles were impounded by Chitpur police station. The drivers managed 

to escape. 

 In the other accident, a 30-year-old unidentified youth was run over by a private 

bus on BB Ganguly Street around 7.55 am. He was admitted to Medical College and 

Hospital, where he later succumbed to his injuries. The bus was stopped by the 

police and taken to Muchipara police station. 

 Howrah State General Hospital is doing without its only ambulance for the past 

25 days. The vehicle is in the garage for repairs after its battery component 

developed snags. 

 More than 20,000 people are treated in the hospital every month. The ambulance, 

on an average, transported 10 patients every day to hospitals in Calcutta. 

 The relatives of the patients are being forced to hire private ambulances, 

which are more expensive, said an officer of the hospital. 

 Superintendent Shubhrangshu Chakraborty stated that he is trying to get the 

ambulance repaired as soon as possible. 

 Shyamal Mondal, 24, drowned after accidentally falling into a water reservoir in the Calcutta Leather Complex on Sunday. Police said Mondal was cleaning the reservoir when he lost his foothold. He was fished out and taken to NRS Medical College and Hospital, where the doctors pronounced him dead.

 Gobinda Mondal, a 17-year-old help, committed suicide on Sunday afternoon in 

a house in Salt Lake?s DL block. He hanged himself from the ceiling. 

 Police said Mondal had run away from his home in Bihar and had taken up employment 

in the house. 

 On Sunday, he had sought permission from the owner to go home, but was apparently 

refused. He committed suicide when the family members went out. 

 Acting on a tip-off, police raided three shops in Sonarpur and seized nearly 1,300 pirated compact discs. According to police, the two persons arrested in this connection were involved in piracy for a long time.

 Sonarpur Thana Club Samannay Sammilani has organised a 10-day book fair at Sonarpur Railway Quarter Park from November 26. Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chattopadhyay will inaugurate the fair. Secretary of the fair committee Satyabrata Pal said this will be the 16th edition of the fair. Its theme will be North 24-Parganas.

 The state forest department on Friday released some rescued birds and animals at the recently-inaugurated Chintamoni Kar Abhay Aranya in Narendrapur. The released birds include parrots and parakeets. Three civets and a rat snake were among the animals released. The rescued birds and animals had been kept in the Salt Lake rescue centre.

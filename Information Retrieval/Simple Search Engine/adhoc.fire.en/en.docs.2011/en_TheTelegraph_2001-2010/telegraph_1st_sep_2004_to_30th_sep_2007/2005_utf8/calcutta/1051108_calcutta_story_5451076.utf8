 Those ramp-walkers who don?t own a pet but are comfortable with them will be provided with one by the NGO. The line-up of dogs for the show includes Great Dane, Golden Retriever, Pug, Collie and Basset Hound. ?We will have different sequences and some of them will be with animals,? says Oindrilla Dutt of Open Doors, who tracked down celebrities sympathetic to the cause.

 The line-up reads like a city celeb roster ? Sabyasachi Chakraborty, Chandrayee Ghosh, Arindam Sil, Bikram Ghosh, Tanushree Shankar, Priti Patel, Sharmila Biswas, Suvaprasanna, Piu Sarkar, Mona-Pali ? rounded off by a bevy of models led by Shonal Rawat.

 For many, pets are family. ?My five dogs are growing up along with my five-year-old daughter Anwesha. On Saturday, I will be on the ramp with Bhonda. My daughter will also be on the ramp, with a Miniature Daschund owned by my uncle,? smiles actress Swastika.

 June, proud owner of goldfish Goldie, is most particular about its upkeep. ?I change the water every alternate day and feed it before leaving for work,? says the actress, who?s planning to walk with ?a Pug or a Lab, if not Goldie?.

 Madhumanti, for one, dotes on her feline friends. ?Cats look after themselves, you don?t have to mollycoddle them. If you sterilise a female cat, she will be the most hassle-free pet you can have. They are very loving and giving, unlike what most people think them to be ? selfish,? says the newsreader and emcee who divides her time between 11-year-old Kich and nine-and-a-half-year-old-Tweedledee. But cats are ?very shy?, so Madhumanti could take one-year-old Toto to the ramp, instead. 

 ?One doesn?t need to own a pet in order to be an animal lover. If we show compassion towards the stray dogs in our locality and take care of them, it?s more than enough,? feels actress-turned-animal activist Nilanjanaa, who regrets missing out on the fashion show due to personal commitments.

 On Saturday, designers Snehasish Bhattacharya, Sayon Mitra, Shamlu Dudeja, Jayasree Chatterjee and the boutique Darbari will dress up the celebrities, with jewellery by BC Sen. Fashion apart, the show will have a performance by Anjum Katyal and Francis Lepcha.

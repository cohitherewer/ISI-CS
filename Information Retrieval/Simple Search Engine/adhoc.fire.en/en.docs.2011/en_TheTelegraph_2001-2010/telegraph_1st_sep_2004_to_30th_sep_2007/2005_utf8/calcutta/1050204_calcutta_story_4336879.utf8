The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fate of friendship

Farooque Sheikh and Sonali Bendre perform Aapki Soniya, the 

sequel to Tumhari Amrita

 When Brian Russo, Fulbright Visiting Lecturer in performing arts at Rabindra Bharati University and Loreto College, performed at the American Center last month under the aegis of the United States Educational Foundation in India, one wondered whether he had consciously selected the two plays knowing of their popularity in Calcutta.

 Edward Albee?s The Zoo Story is a perennial favourite on the college circuit, at festivals or otherwise; but regular productions of it also occur, the last one only a few months ago by Theatrecian, while Russo was in town. 

 On the other hand, at least four interpretations of A.R. Gurney?s Love Letters have passed through the city over the last 14 years, starting with the Artistes Repertory Theatre from the US, and including Feroz Khan?s famous but unacknowledged and distorted adaptation, Tumhari Amrita. 

 Inevitably, comparisons cropped up with Russo and his co-star, Lee-Alison Sibley. Much more familiar with New England?s WASP culture, Russo and Sibley portrayed the best-friends-turned-failed-lovers naturally, and conveyed a subtext expressing the preciousness of the affluent lifestyle in which the characters grew up. 

 Gurney had broken the rules of playwriting by disabling the actors? movements throughout, having them read from the letters sitting at a table. 

 Russo and Sibley tackled this difficult challenge of immobility through voice modulation, yet never looking at each other and, instead, often gazing fondly up and away into the auditorium while reacting facially to what the other was reading. 

 The Zoo Story received a twist as Janardan Ghosh played Peter opposite Russo?s Jerry, giving Albee?s idea of human isolation an additional layer in which a successful immigrant Indian (perhaps) bears the brunt of Jerry?s verbal taunting and assault. 

 Russo transformed completely into a physically domineering representative of the white majority towering over the frail intellectual-looking Asian who carried a book that symbolised his apparently superior literacy. 

 The evening brought the common theme of relationships into focus. Gurney shows how seemingly small decisions destine the fate of a friendship, changing what could have led to marriage into just cordial correspondence and ultimately a parting of ways on to totally different orbits, one ascending to public fame, the other hurtling to self-destruction. 

 Albee, of course, talks of alienation, as one lonely person tries desperately to initiate communication with a stranger in a last act of faith, even if it leads to death. 

 Two American plays, each with two characters in conversation, both ending with the death of one of them. Interesting juxtaposition.

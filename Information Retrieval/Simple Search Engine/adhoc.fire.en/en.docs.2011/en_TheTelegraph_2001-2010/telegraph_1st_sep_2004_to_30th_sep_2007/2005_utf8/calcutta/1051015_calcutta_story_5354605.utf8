 A terminal station for local trains in alignment with the proposed Metro Railway station building in Garia and a bus terminus in the vicinity are being planned to provide better road and rail connectivity to commuters of all the modes of transport.

 Officials said the Metro terminal station building would be completed by 2007.

 ?There are plans to develop New Garia into an integrated terminal, on the lines of Dum Dum, to provide local train, Metro and bus services, via the EM Bypass,? a senior official of Eastern Railway (ER) said on Friday.

 The decision was taken after a high-level inspection on Friday. 

 Shyam Kumar and P. Sudhakar, general managers of ER and Metro Railway, respectively, P. Baviskar, CEO, Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), Basudeb Acharya, MP and chairman of the railway standing committee, and two other MPs, Sujan Chakraborty and Amitava Nandi, visited the site later in the day.

 ?A joint survey will be carried out by ER, Metro Railway and CMDA for the acquisition of land and to work out the cost of the project. A report on the matter will be submitted within a week,? said Soumitra Majumdar, ER?s chief public relations officer.

 ?For setting up the new terminal, additional rail lines need to be laid and this will require extra land,? said MP Chakraborty. He said the state government would help the railways to acquire the land.

 A pair of rail lines exists, but officials said at least two more were required. Senior officials will meet on Monday to discuss the project.

 The new terminal station will act as the interface between commuters of the Metro and ER. ?The two stations are being planned to be connected by either a subway or a footbridge, as in Dum Dum,? said Sudhakar of Metro Railway. 

 The existing railway station in Garia is quite a distance from the proposed Metro terminal station. 

 ?It is also overburdened and once the Metro becomes operative, the pressure will increase further. The new railway station will solve the problem,? said MP Chakraborty. 

 The issue of encroachers deferring the Metro extension was also discussed during the visit to the site.

 Vice-chairman of Rajpur-Sonarpur Municipality Tarit Chakraborty said it had been decided in 2000 to demolish the encroaching houses either totally or partially. 

 ?A compensation package was formulated. But in the meantime, the land price has escalated. The land-owners should be compensated accordingly now,? he said.

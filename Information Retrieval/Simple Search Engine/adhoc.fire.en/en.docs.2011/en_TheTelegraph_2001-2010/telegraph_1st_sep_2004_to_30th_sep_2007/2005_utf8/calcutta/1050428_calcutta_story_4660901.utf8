 Two of the city?s biggest career and education fairs breezed through town last week. And at both, stepping off the beaten track ? in place and pursuit ? was the top student trend.

 Inquiries for biotechnology, jewellery and fashion designing, airhostess and air-crew training poured in. Singapore and Dubai emerged as the new education destinations, challenging reigning champs the US and the UK.

 ?There were more girls this time, and more visitors to the fair. Lots of parents dropped in with their children, and large numbers came in repeatedly, to make up their minds,? said Sanjeev Bolia, CEO, Afairs, organiser of the four-day 13th Career Fair at Ice Skating Rink. The footfall, at over 13,000, was more than last year?s.

 And although MBAs were still the most popular option, Arena Multimedia had its fair share of curious crowds, as did Frankfinn Institute for Airhostess Training. And the free Career Guide booklet listed details of courses like VJing, oceanography, cartooning and microbiology.

 The interest from students towards MBBS degrees in Chinese state-run medical colleges was also ?encouraging?, said Dipankar Kar, counsellor for Saraswati Online, representing three such colleges in India. ?It?s cheaper than going to the US or UK, but has the same value as an Indian degree. Indo-China relations have improved, so people are interested. Last year, there were 77 students from India, 33 of them from Calcutta. This year, we hope to send over 200 students.?

 At the three-day 14th India International Education Fair at The Park, off-beat was the name of the education game, from hotel management in Cyprus to film studies in New Zealand. ?We take the fair around the country. But not all participants travel to every destination. Last year, in Calcutta, there were five stalls. This year, there are 12. Calcutta is a potential market that people are starting to tap,? said Siddharth Jain, chief, marketing operations, Global Events and Expositions, organiser of the event.

 While there were three institutions from Cyprus in some of the other metros, Calcutta had only one. But Costas Saveriades, director of international admissions and media, Casa College Nicosia, was happiest with the response in Calcutta. ?Although I didn?t go to Mumbai, my colleagues said it was a waste of time. But here, I have accomplished the target I set out to achieve in terms of admissions.?

 The eagerness to study abroad was much more evident this year at both fairs. But the interest had shifted to cost-affective yet recognised options in Singapore and Dubai.

 ?Because there are a lot of universities from the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand opening up campuses in Singapore, where it is cheaper to study for Indians and is also closer home,? explained a spokesperson for Singapore Tourism Board.

 Institutions like the Canadian Institute for Advanced Learning. ?We have a school, for toddlers to teens, in Singapore. We have had quite a few inquiries from Calcutta, for education from the middle school onwards,? said Karina Tan, international recruitment manager.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Only the short of it

 A moment from An Unknown Night to be shown at the film festival

 All of 86 films, screened through nine days, at one venue ? the second edition of the Kolkata Short Film Festival is set to begin on September 2. Till the 10th, two shows every evening at Nandan II are dedicated to screenings of films from two minutes to 45 minutes long.

 Organised by Chitrabani and Nandan, the festival includes two films each from Andhra Pradesh and Bihar, one each from Maharashtra and Rajasthan, three from Jharkhand and two each from Bangladesh and UK. There are documentaries and fiction, on issues like death, prostitution, communal violence, the art of mime, folk and tribal festivals, from film-makers young and old, amateur and experienced. 

 ?It was quite successful last year, so we wanted to continue it,? said P.J. Joseph, director, Chitrabani. ?We wanted to dispel myths like it takes three hours to tell a story. It is also a misconception that all short films are documentaries. We have organised an interaction involving the directors and producers on their films on September 20.?

 He added that around 120 films had been entered for the festival, from which 86 had been chosen. A special film, Shining Ray, on Satyajit Ray?s Pather Panchali, will also be screened. Entry to the shows is free, with passes available on a first-come-first-served basis at Chitrabani, as well as at the venue an hour before the show.

 ?Although there are 74 films from West Bengal, there are national and international flavours, too,? said Nilanjan Chatterjee, CEO, Nandan. The movie complex authorities have plans to select 10-12 of the films and send them, with a synopsis, to television channels for screening.

 The festival will be inaugurated on Friday, the 20th anniversary of Nandan, in the presence of director Tarun Majumdar and actor Sabyasachi Chakraborty. Thereafter, it?s a feast of 17 screenings with 35 hours of running time, at 3 pm and 5.30 pm daily.

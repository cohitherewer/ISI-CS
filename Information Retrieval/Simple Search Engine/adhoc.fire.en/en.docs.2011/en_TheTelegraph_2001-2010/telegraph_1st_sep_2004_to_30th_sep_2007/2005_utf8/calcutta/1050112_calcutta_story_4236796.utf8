 Tribute in melody

 Besides being a great visionary of modern India, Swami Vivekananda was an ardent admirer of Indian classical music and an accomplished singer himself. It is said that Sri Ramakrishna would be ecstatic on hearing his favourite disciple sing. To commemorate Swamiji?s 142nd birth anniversary, The Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture hosts a day-long music festival featuring well-known artistes from all over the country. Spanning three sessions, the morning segment commences with a sundri recital by Pramod Prabhasankar Gaikwad, followed by Kushal Das? sitar and Rashid Khan?s vocal recitals. The line-up for the afternoon session: Chitresh Das (Kathak dance) and Hari Prasad Chaurasia (flute). Faiyaz Wasifuddin Dagar sets the evening?s mood with a dhrupad recital, while L. Subramaniam?s violin recital brings down the curtain on an enriching experience.

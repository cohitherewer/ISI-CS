 A pilgrim?s progress

 In Benaras (formerly known as Kashi), the oldest sacred city of the Hindus, opposites coexist in natural harmony. The city embraces life and death, poverty and wealth, the pursuit of pleasure and spiritual seeking, within its concurrent flow with the holy waters of the Ganges. Kashi Yatra, which traces the journey of a courtesan of this city, is a celebration of life as visualised through her eyes as she gives up her earlier way of life to become a pilgrim. Performed through classical Bharata Natyam by Malavika Sarukkai, who has also choreographed the item, Kashi Yatra tells the story of the courtesan and the city, weaving their lives into one and discovering secret inner spaces within their souls. Through the energy and dynamics of the language of dance, Sarukkai beautifully articulates the rich, overlapping textures of the courtesan?s experiences, at the same time bringing to life the colour and vitality of the city where she undertakes her life?s journey.

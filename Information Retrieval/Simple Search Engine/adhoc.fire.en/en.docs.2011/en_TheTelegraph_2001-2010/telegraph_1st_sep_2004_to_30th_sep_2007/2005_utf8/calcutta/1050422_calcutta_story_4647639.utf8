The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Get set, go green

 On the occasion of Earth Day on April 22, Young Metro finds a student initiative aimed at spreading awareness on nature and conserving the environment

 The voice of youth, a platform for expression, a means to get across a message, a medium to make the world sit up and take note... All this and more is what New Leaf means to the team that produces it and to those who read it.

 Initially started by Don Bosco Park Circus school?s nature club a couple of years ago, it fizzled for a while. Then, it was taken up by a group of student enthusiasts and soon spread its wings and voice. Although still an environment and nature-based newsletter, New Leaf is now an inter-school initiative.

 Mahadevi Birla, Birla High School, St Thomas Girls School, Laxmipat Singhania Academy, GD Birla Centre for Education and Don Bosco Park Circus are all on board, while St Xavier?s and Army Public School are soon to be officially part of the New Leaf family. There are student contributors from other schools, too. 

 Each school offers a chief reporter, four reporters and two representatives to the board that runs the newsletter and a teachers?s advisory board member. ?We have left space on the board for representatives from schools that want to join us. The response has been quite good so far,? says editor-in-chief Sonal Agarwal.

 However, the magazine of sorts run by a dedicated team, has now run into the most common of problems ? a funds crunch. The March issue, for which the matter is ready and which now stands at 12 pages, has been put on hold, because there is not enough money to publish it, laments the Class XII student of Birla High School.

 The revenue comes from advertisements that the team gathers through their own contacts. The editorial staff doubles as the advertising and sales representatives. This time, the advertisements are not enough. Each issue costs Rs 5. 

 ?But we have to raise the rate to Rs 10 from this time, because we are also increasing the number of pages. If we make it any more expensive, then students might not be able to afford it,? adds Sonal.

 The last issue, in November 2004, was a mix of stories, poems, contests and letters. This time, the team promises more ? cover story on Calcutta?s climate, interactive section, awareness campaign on ill-treatment of animals, celebrity interview, study tips, nature-based games and puzzles, facts and figures on flora and fauna, a special eco-calender, a feature on Earth Day...

 The designing and page-making is done by Ruchi, Sonal?s 23-year-old sister, a professional graphic designer. She works as a freelancer, but finds the time to help in her sibling?s endeavour. Sonal might want to be an MBA, but for now, her efforts are concentrated in making New Leaf a success.

 ?Hopefully we will be able to bring it out soon,? she smiles. ?We are working on it. Maybe in April itself,? Sonal signs off.

 What?s Happening This Week

 For kicks

 Forty-eight teams, cheerleaders in the stands and some fancy footwork. That?s the essence of the Linc-TTIS Five-a-side Football Tournament, co-sponsored by Patton, in progress at CC amp;FC. It started on April 18 and will end on April 30. While the league matches are scheduled to end soon, the knockout rounds will kick off next week, as budding footballers fight it out for the trophy. The quarter-finals will be held on April 27 and 28, the semi-finals on the 29th and the final match will be held on the 30th. Schools from the city and the districts have signed up. Last year?s winner Kodalia High School might not be around this time, but the competition is tough. Each participant will get a certificate. The final prizes include best scorer, best footballer, and two runners-up. If you?re not part of the on-field action, cheer the teams from the sidelines between 3 pm and 5 pm everyday.

 Career corner

 Exams are over and it?s time to enjoy. But if you?re more worried about your future prospects than catching up on some rest and relaxation, then drop in at the 14th Career Fair at the Ice Skating Rink. The annual event will be on from April 22 to 25 this year. The organisers, Afairs, promise over 100 career options, free guidance, aptitude test, seminars, educational loans, job recruitment offers and more. The highlights include a stall by the Indian Air Force, besides other career stations on management, engineering, IT, biotechnology, hotel management, multimedia, computer aided designing, media studies, airhostess and air crew training, jewellery designing, travel and tourism, hardware training and interior decoration. Information about foreign institutions in the US, UK, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Thailand, China, Singapore and Dubai will also be available. Students can interact with and receive counselling from representatives of leading Indian and foreign institutions. Visitors to the fair will also receive a free Career Guide Book, with an insight into career openings like technical writing, fashion designing, aeronautical engineering, cartooning, microbiology, marine engineering, VJing, architecture, oceanography, pharmacology, forensic sciences and criminology. It also addresses eligibility criteria, essential attributes, qualifications, job profile and pros and cons of various professions. The aptitude test will assess basic skills and psychometric attributes of candidates and suggest suitable career alternatives based on their performance. On Friday, the fair will be open from 2 pm. On other days, it will be on from 11 am to 8 pm.

 Tune in

 Music is in the air as the summer heat soars in the city. On Friday, April 22, United States Educational Foundation in India (USEFI), Calcutta, will present Raga 2005, an evening of Indian classical music, co-sponsored by RPG Enterprises. Competing schools are Ballygunge Shiksha Sadan, Gokhale Memorial Girls School, National High School for Girls, Mahadevi Birla Girls School, Vivekananda Mission School, AK Ghosh Memorial School, and Future Foundation School. This is the 2nd Annual USEFI-High School-Industry Partnership Program. The contest will be judged by Falguni Mitra, guru/prefect, ITC Sangeet Research Academy, Calcutta, a Fulbright host institution, and Nilima Sen Gangopadhyaya, a music critic. The event at the American Center, from 5 pm to 8 pm, is open to everyone.

 Right to die

 The long, hard tussle between Terry Schiavo?s parents Bob and Mary Schindler and her husband and legal guardian Michael Schiavo came to an end on Thursday, March 30. Terry?s death raises the question of the right to euthanasia. She had been in a ?persistent vegetative state? ever since a cardiac arrest in 1990 starved her brain of oxygen. 

 Terry?s parents had pleaded with the court that their daughter be allowed to live, but the US Supreme Court rejected the appeal and sided with her husband in ruling that she wouldn?t have liked to live in this pathetic condition and should be allowed to die peacefully. 

 The moot question now is the right of a patient in a vegetative state to ask for his or her death. The issue goes beyond the specific case of Terry Schiavo, as there is ample evidence to believe that once the right to die is allowed, it will provide a legal cover for misuse by patients. Suicide, after all, is a punishable offense. 

 But every coin has two sides. Terry Schiavo had withstood 15 years of pain and suffering. Under these circumstances, a lot of people would have chosen to die rather than strain every nerve to live. 

 However, we all just have the one life and undoubtedly, it is the most precious thing we possess. We have to fight against all odds and abide by the laws of nature.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Krishnendu Banerjee

 Government employee and a daily passenger

 For us office-goers, advancing office time in summer would be a blessing. The packed train compartments are insufferable during these months. Some companies may advance the time by an hour, some by 30 minutes or so. That way the peak hour crowd will get distributed. If this happens for three months in a year, it will also provide a change in the drudgery of routine life. That may work as a motivation. I take the 7.33 am train from Ranaghat to reach Old Court House Street at 10 am. It will not be a problem if office starts at say 9 am. In most houses now, the food is kept ready the night before. Rather, the early end to the day would allow us to have some time for marketing, which becomes difficult on Sundays. Also, this way we will have more time for the family.

 Council panel for complaint probe

 Chandrima Ghosh: How does the bar council work? Can one lodge a complaint against an advocate with the council?

 The bar council is the apex body of the legal fraternity. The council, which is statutory in nature, has been formed under a definite section of Constitutional laws.

 Like the medical council, the bar council, too, reserves the sole right to provide registration to advocates. A person with a degree in law from a university will not be eligible to appear in court and contest a case unless he or she has obtained a registration number from the council. For registration, a candidate has to fulfil some criteria laid down by the council.

 The bar council has a disciplinary committee that looks into complaints against advocates.

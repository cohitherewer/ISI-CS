The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Simpler, swifter nod for outstation board affiliation

 - Delhi prod unravels English schools? registration process 

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Calcutta, and the rest of the state, may witness a spurt in private English-medium schools.

 Prodded by a Central directive, the Bengal government has streamlined its procedure of granting no-objection certificates (NOCs) to schools seeking affiliation to the Delhi-based Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) or the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations.

 The Delhi directive, which reached the state government last month, says that out-of-state boards may not consider the state government?s NOC if a school has to wait for it for more than three months after submitting the application.

 ?We welcome the directive, as it is directly related to the interests of many parents who want to admit their wards to private English-medium schools,? said Debaditya Chakraborty, secretary, school education department. 

 He admitted that in the absence of a proper system, the government on several occasions had taken a long time in granting an NOC.

 An NOC is a document a school has to furnish for obtaining affiliation under any board other than the state-controlled Madhyamik board or the Higher Secondary council.

 The Centre?s directive follows complaints from several schools that despite having the required infrastructure, they had failed to secure an NOC and hence, affiliation from an out-of-state board.

 Students have to bear the brunt of the problem that follows a delay in issuing an NOC. Students of Classes X and XII of an unaffiliated school have to register themselves with an affiliated school before sitting for the board examinations.

 Asked what had prompted the Centre to issue the directive, school education secretary Chakraborty said: ?We do not know the reason. But we are ready to comply with the order and have already streamlined the process we used to follow for granting NOCs.? 

 For instance, he pointed out, the applications were earlier examined at various stages. Now, the procedure has been made simpler and less time-consuming. 

 Department officials also attributed the delay to the lack of awareness among schools applying for an NOC. Most schools fail to answer correctly the queries relating to the conditions they need to fulfil for obtaining an affiliation.

 ?Many schools provide vague information, forcing us to clarify the data. This takes up a lot of time,? an official said. 

 The conditions that a school needs to fulfil to be eligible for an NOC: 

 4It must commit to shift to a permanent establishment within three years if it stands on rented premises at the time of submitting the application

 4There has to be an adequate number of spacious classrooms, libraries and laboratories

 4The pay-scales of teachers and non-teaching employees must be on a par with that offered to their counterparts in government-aided schools

 4The school must have an adequate number of students.

 Sources in the education department said over three dozen schools are in queue for an NOC. There are schools whose proposals have been pending for more than a year.

 ?I have submitted an application more than a year ago. But the government inspection is still pending,? said the principal of a Howrah school. 

 Welcoming the Centre?s order, ISCE Council member Gillian Rosemary Hart said: ?There was no well-defined system and most schools were given NOCs on an ad hoc basis. We are happy that the government has introduced measures to ensure quick disposal of the NOCs.?

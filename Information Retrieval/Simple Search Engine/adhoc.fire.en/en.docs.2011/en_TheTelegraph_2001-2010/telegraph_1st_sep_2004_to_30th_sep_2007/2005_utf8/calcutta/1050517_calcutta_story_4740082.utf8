 Neo-literate laurels for dropout

 Jyotsna Das was recently awarded a prize for acquiring basic reading and writing skills after attending only a few of the government?s literacy classes. She had, however, studied up to Class VI, before dropping out because of financial constraints.

 Cases like Jyotsna?s have been pouring in by the dozen ever since the government instituted awards for outstanding students and teachers at literacy classes in a few municipal areas around the city.

 At a programme on February 21, Jyotsna, a resident of Sardarpara, in Belghoria, under ward no. 20, was presented as a neo-literate and asked to give a speech on Bengali language. She was awarded the prize for the best speech.

 ?It has been a great achievement on her part. She has truly set an example,? said a senior municipal officer, commending her performance.

 At the same programme, Gobindo Ganguly, chairman of Kamarhati Municipality, received a special prize from chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee for outstanding progress in the literacy drive in his area. 

 ?I had studied up to Class VI at Mahakali Girl?s School in Belghoria. I dropped out in 2001 as my father could not afford to bear the expenses for my education any longer,? said Jyotsna.

 ?Jaya Roy, who is a coordinator for the literacy campaign, had asked me to join her class. At the awards ceremony, I found it quite easy to give the speech,? she added. 

 Jaya confessed that she had admitted Jyotsna to her classes as an illiterate despite knowing that she had studied up to Class VI. ?I thought she could fare well in the classes. Though we have 70 students, hardly 10 to 15 turn up,? Jaya explained.

 P.B. Salim, sub-divisional officer of Barrackpore and supervisor of the literacy campaign, denied knowledge of similar cases.

 ?We have decided to look into the matter once the civic election is over,? he said.

 Municipal chairman Ganguly said he was not aware of any such incident. ?This is not the correct way to achieve the excellence in literacy drives. I will inquire into the matter,? he asserted.

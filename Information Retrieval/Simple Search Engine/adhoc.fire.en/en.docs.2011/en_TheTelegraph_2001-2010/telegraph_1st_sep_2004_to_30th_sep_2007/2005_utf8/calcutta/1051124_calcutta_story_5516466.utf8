 You share your birthday with...

 Amol Palekar 

You make the best use of opportunities. You hate criticism and confrontation. You desire compassion and honesty in relationships. You need to develop practical understanding about relationships. You try hard to please everyone but do remember that it?s impossible to be liked by everyone. You are always well-informed and never at a loss for words. ? Kusum Bhandari

 Neglect cry over death

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A 70-year-old asthma patient died at the Infectious Diseases hospital in Beleghata on Monday night, allegedly after medical attendants failed to give him oxygen. 

 Following the death, irate relatives heckled the doctors and medical attendants, forcing the authorities to seek police help. An inquiry was initiated into the death after the relatives lodged a formal complaint.

 Khitis Ghosh, the patient, complained of breathlessness on Monday morning. He was rushed to the emergency ward of the hospital, in the same locality. He was later admitted to the male ward.

 According to the relatives, the doctors and other medical staff did not attend to Ghosh, even while he was gasping for breath. The attendants allegedly misbehaved with the relatives, when they tried to draw their attention to the patient.

 The patient?s condition grew critical on Monday evening. ?Even then, the hospital staff failed to provide him with an oxygen cylinder. The patient died around 9.30 pm,? said a relative of Ghosh.

 His son Anup stated: ?My father was gasping for breath from the morning and it was evident that his condition was worsening by the hour. The medical attendants in the ward refused to listen to us. Even after searching for half-an-hour, we could not find the doctor on duty.?

 He added: ?We frantically asked the doctors and the attendants to provide my father with an oxygen cylinder, but they told us it was not necessary.? 

 The relatives then entered the ward and heckled the doctors on duty and the attendants. Superintendent A.P. Behra, along with other staff, tried to pacify the men, but in vain. The superintendent later called Beleghata police station and asked for help.

 ?The relatives were informed of the patient?s grave condition at the time of admission. The doctors did their best and all possible care was taken,? asserted Behra.

 Ghosh?s relatives later came back to lodge a complaint with the authorities.

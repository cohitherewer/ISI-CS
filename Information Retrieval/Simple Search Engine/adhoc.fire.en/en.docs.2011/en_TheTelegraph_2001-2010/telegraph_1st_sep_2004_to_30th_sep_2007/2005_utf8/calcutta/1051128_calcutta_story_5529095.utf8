The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Advantage, vintage club 

New-age features

 - Twin new buildings with contemporary amenities in modern makeover

 SUBHRO SAHA

 The restrained and carefully-proportioned fa?ade of Palladian form at the rear, the splendid double-storeyed twin-porticoes at the entrance, the deep-cut rusticated stonework and hierarchy of orders in the elegant edifice will all remain the way they are.

 Yet, the main building at the magnificent 11, Russell Street premises of the Royal Calcutta Turf Club (RCTC), of 1820 vintage, is gearing up for a dramatic change. 

 The regal structure will become the cornerstone of a modern makeover ? as the countrys original racing rendezvous morphs into a hip city social club in the heart of downtown Calcutta.

 April 2008 is the target date for completion set by the turf club authorities for the Rs 25-crore project coming up on the same campus and being billed as a lifeline for the cash-strapped institution. ?We have already kicked off work on the restoration of the main building, which should be fully functional again by October-November, 2006,? steward Sujit Bhattacharyya told Metro.

 The RCTC management, which has ?suitably modified? the original design solution provided by Bhubaneswar-based Creative Design Group, as per the suggestions of the Heritage Committee, hopes to entertain members and guests at the city club by Poila Baisakh ?08. 

 The two dilapidated residential blocks will be knocked down and two new G+3 structures will come up on Russell Street to house contemporary amenities.

 The hub of the reinvention exercise is the main building, which, following restoration, will house a bar-cum-cigar lounge, the billiards and card rooms and a speciality continental dining area, besides the main administrative office, boardroom, reception area and, possibly, a museum of racing memorabilia catalogued by Bowrings.

 Work on restoring the exterior to its original splendour as well as revitalising the crumbling inner fabric has started in earnest. A portion of the roof on the western side had caved in two years ago, kicking off the repair initiative.

 ?Our primary concern is to increase the life of the structure and to control the speed of damage,? said Bishwadip Sen, restoration expert, who was involved in restoration of Puri?s Jagannath Temple and now the Metropolitan Building in Calcutta.

 The RCTC management hopes to lure new members with a clutch of new-age features. A giant banquet hall, a 65-seater multi-cuisine eatery, a 40-seater Oriental restaurant, pub, open-air barbeque, coffee shop and bakery ? the food and beverage menu will match any other club, the officials claimed.

 For the sports-minded, the fare includes two synthetic tennis courts, an outdoor swimming pool and a heated indoor pool with jacuzzi, massage parlour, beauty salon, gym, squash and badminton. 

 ?We will also have 48 guestrooms, including nine suites, and a business centre, besides 60,000 sq ft of commercial space and parking for 400 cars,? says J.N. Sapru, steward and chairman of the think-tank formed for developing the social club.

 Membership is expected to open by next summer, when RCTC hopes to enrol the first batch of 500. ?We are looking at an optimum strength of 2,000 members at an entry fee of Rs 2 to 2.5 lakh,? declared Bhattacharyya.

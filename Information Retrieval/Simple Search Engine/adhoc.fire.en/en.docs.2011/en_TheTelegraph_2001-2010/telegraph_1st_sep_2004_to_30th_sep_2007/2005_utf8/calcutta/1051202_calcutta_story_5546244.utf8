The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Question mark on hiked cable rate 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Will you pay more to watch your favourite soap or a crucial soccer match next month? If you expect the cableman to know, you?d be expecting too much.

 In its latest review of cable television charges, cable watchdog Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has raised the subscription ceiling by four per cent with effect from January 2006. Which means that if you were paying Rs 100 till December 2005, you will have to pay Rs 104 from January onwards.

 But cable operators and multi-system operators (MSO) in the city are clueless about whether they will be able to implement the hike.

 Trai?s notification assumes that a similar seven per cent increase it had mandated last year as an ?inflation adjustment?, was effected. 

 ?Due to the volatility of the market then, most operators in the city were unable to realise the amount from subscribers,? pointed out Mrinal Chatterjee, a north Calcutta operator. ?And customers simply will not accept an 11 per cent increase now.?

 The changes were supposed to have affected every link of the viewer-operator-MSO-broadcaster chain. ?But MSOs have not paid us, claiming operators are not paying them,? stated an official of an entertainment bouquet.

 Market-watchers, however, blame it on the practice of ?discounting? by MSOs. 

 ?To retain operators, most MSOs offer hefty discounts and will simply not implement any kind of hikes,? explained an operator.

 Another factor is the confusion over rates, following the introduction of a ?second bouquet? of channels by all broadcasters last year, including Hungama and STAR One for STAR, HBO and Pogo for Zee Turner and Ten Sports and Nick for SET Discovery.

 The state government?s effort to bring order to the cable chaos has also come a cropper.

 ?Everyone is losing business. The MSOs, operators and broadcasters must sit together to sort out this matter,? offered Raj Singh of MSO CableComm.

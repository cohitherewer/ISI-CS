 Campus accord on early solution 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The process to end the two-month-long stalemate at Jadavpur University inched a step further on Wednesday, with both the five-member inquiry team and the students of the faculty of engineering and technology students? union (Fetsu) arriving at a consensus on an early resolution. 

 At Writers? Buildings, too, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee gave a hint that the deadlock may end soon. 

 ?We are hoping that the impasse at Jadavpur University will be resolved within a day or two,? he said. 

 The inquiry committee set up by the government to probe the police action on fasting students on the night of June 10 has submitted its report to the chief minister. 

 Manoj Mitra, dean of the engineering and technology faculty and chairman of the five-member committee, said Wednesday?s talks with the students were more positive than those in the past few days. 

 ?But we still have not reached the stage to announce the exact date of resuming normal academic activities on the campus,? Mitra said, after the hour-long talks.

 The committee met the students for the sixth time on Wednesday after it was set up a fortnight ago, following the chief minister?s directive.

 Sources said the university had failed to convince the students to withdraw the movement by taking a hard stand, and also by creating pressure on them. The inquiry team?s current strategy is to resolve the disputes through several phases of discussions.

 The university suspended five senior students in April for their involvement in campus violence in September 2003, on the basis of the Amit Sen inquiry committee?s recommendations. 

 Fetsu began the movement on the heels of the suspension. 

 Parag Banerjee, Fetsu leader, said: ?We placed a number of suggestions before the authorities on how normalcy can be restored on the campus. We are ready to soften our stand if the authorities agree to concede to some of our main demands.? 

 He, however, refused to divulge details of the meeting. 

 Sources close to the inquiry committee said the students have agreed to withdraw some demands, like resignations of the vice-chancellor and the registrar.

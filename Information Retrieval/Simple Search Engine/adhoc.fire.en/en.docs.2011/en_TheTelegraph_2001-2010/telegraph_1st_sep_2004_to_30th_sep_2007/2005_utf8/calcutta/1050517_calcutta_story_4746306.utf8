Bird boost for high-flyers

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 According to Feng Shui, displaying paintings of 

birds soaring high up like phoenix, parrots, macaw, roosters and flamingo are 

excellent symbols for boosting ones career. But care must be taken to ensure 

that the paintings dont feature birds in perched positions 

Q: I am a 27-year-old software engineer 

employed in a multinational company. Although I work very hard, I am not getting 

due appreciation and rewards from my company. Please advise. 

R. Bose

The Solution: The south is associated with 

recognition and appreciation. It is ruled by the fire element and nourished by 

wood energy. Fresh plants and red flowers enhance this area effectively. If the 

real ones are difficult to maintain, silk flowers can alternatively be placed 

here. Paintings of birds soaring high up like flamingo, parrots, roosters, macaw 

and phoenix are excellent symbols for boosting your career. Galloping horses, 

shooting rockets and illuminated globes are also positive symbols to be placed 

here. Your achievements like trophies, shields, and certificates should be lavishly 

displayed. If all these dont help, then paint the south wall of your study 

in red and light nine tall candles in green and red every evening here for a few 

minutes.

Q: I am in love with a man who is not doing 

too well in his career. He does not believe in Feng Shui, but I have firm faith 

in it. My parents wont agree to our marriage till he is established in his 

career. According to his Kua number, the north is his Sheng Chi direction and 

its also a career corner according to Feng Shui. Can I activate this corner 

in my room?

Jennifer

The Solution: It will be more effective if 

he activates his career corner in his own environment. But if he is not willing 

to do so and since you are so concerned about him, similar effects can be achieved 

if you activate the northern corner of your room with faith and conviction. Picture 

of a tortoise, mounted on a blue background with a metal frame, will be a good 

energiser for his career. His photograph placed next to such a powerful energiser 

will yield positive results.

Q: I have recently got married and have 

noticed that my bed has twin mattresses and boxes underneath for storing things. 

My husband and I feel uncomfortable while sleeping together. Are the mattresses 

and storage boxes responsible for it?

Sharmishta

The Solution: Sleeping on a bed with twin mattresses 

is symbolic of separation and conflicts and is not advised for couples. A simple 

remedy is to wrap a red ribbon all the way round the four sides of the mattress 

on a full moon day. Start from the south-west corner and end here with a pretty 

knot. You can also spread a thin double mattress on top of the existing ones. 

Boxes under beds are not recommended as they resemble coffins. But if there are 

storage problems, then you should be careful not to keep pointed metallic objects, 

or old dirty clothes in them. Instead, store fresh clean linen and towels here.

Q: We live on the first floor of a building 

adjacent to a busy road. One wall has a set of narrow but tall mirrors that reflect 

the road where there is continuous flow of cars and buses plying. I feel very 

uncomfortable with these mirrors. Is there anything wrong with their placement?

Sarojini

The Solution: When mirrors reflect a busy road, 

they draw in lots of fast-moving energy into the house. This disturbs the Chi 

and creates instability in the lives of its residents. Instead, if mirrors reflect 

a tree in full blossom, you will be attracting soft and peaceful energy. Mirrors 

that are longer than the tallest person in the house are fine as your reflection 

shows plenty of space above your head and this helps in expanding your hopes and 

dreams and makes you feel more positive and confident. Narrow mirrors are not 

advised as we all have an energy field around us, which is about an arms length 

wide. When our image is restricted, we feel cramped and suffocated.

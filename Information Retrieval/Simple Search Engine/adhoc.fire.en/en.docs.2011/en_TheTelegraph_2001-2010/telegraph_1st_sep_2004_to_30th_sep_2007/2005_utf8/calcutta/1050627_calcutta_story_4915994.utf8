The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Airport upgrade put on fast track

 - Twin runways, modern gadgets in makeover

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Work to complete a new international terminal at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport will begin soon. Work on the new cargo terminal and a secondary runway will also be expedited. 

 ?The airport will be the first in the country to have two runways and be equipped with all modern gadgets, too,? said K. Ramalingam, chairman of the Airports Authority of India (AAI).

 Talking after the 10th anniversary celebrations of AAI in the city on Saturday evening, Nilotpal Basu, Rajya Sabha member and chairman, parliamentary standing committee on transport, tourism and culture, added that the government was planning to complete the work in Calcutta faster than in most airports in the country. ?There should not be any further delay in the project,? he said.

 Basu said there was an inexplicable delay in the modernisation of existing airports in other metros. ?There are many inconsistencies in the data provided by the government on the modernisation of Mumbai and Delhi airports,? he elaborated.

 Citing an example, he said the government at first had indicated that at least Rs 20 crore will be required to modernise Delhi and Mumbai airports. ?But now, it is saying only Rs 2.5 crore will do. This appears strange,? he added.

 The chances of a second airport being set up in the city in the near future seemed remote. ?That proposal is extremely vague and tentative. Nothing concrete was proposed,? said Basu. 

 However, AAI chairman K. Ramalingam said: ?I?m not aware of any such proposal.? 

 On private participation in the modernisation of the existing airports, Basu said the AAI is financially sound enough to carry out the job. 

 Besides, some private airlines were duping the government in various ways, he claimed. For example, a private airline had said it would use Calcutta airport as the hangar for its planes. But later, it used Mumbai and Delhi airports, overcrowding the two.

 Both Basu and Ramalingam agreed that the AAI had to face tough challenges, as the country?s aviation sector was growing at a rapid pace. ?The AAI is ready to accept those challenges,? Basu said.

 On the beautification of the airport area, Basu said some private companies had put forward a proposal. The modalities of the project are yet to be finalised. ?We will turn the city airport into an aviation hub in the near future,? Basu added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 The old building of Reserve Bank of India, also known as Currency Building, in BBD Bag, is in a very dilapidated condition. It has now become absolutely necessary to either demolish it or restore it to prevent it from crashing down on pedestrians. Earlier, the central public works department had started pulling it down but was stopped by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. When will the civic body take the next step?

 Many branded bread loaves are not packed properly. Gaps in the polythene or paper package often expose the bread to flies which spread diseases. As it is, monsoon is the season when all kinds of infectious diseases spread through contaminated food. Bread manufacturers should package the product properly. Also, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation should conduct checks and ensure that such food products are hygienically packed.

 There is hardly any justification for undertaking repair work and relaying of tram tracks on certain stretches of APC Roy Road, in Maniktala, in the rainy season. Judging by the amount of work left, it is almost certain that the job would not be finished soon. The road, though wide enough, gets muddy after every shower, adding to the traffic snarls. Such work must be taken up during other seasons.

 Recently, I had to spend a few days in the Nayapatty Road area, off Jessore Road. I am a subscriber of BSNL?s CellOne. I found that my mobile phone didn?t have network coverage in the lanes and bylanes off the road. Only when I was on the main road did my phone catch the signal. I had faced the same problem when I had been to a certain locality on South Sinthee Road. Apparently, BSNL doesn?t have towers in these localities. A similar problem is faced by CellOne users inside Metro stations. I request BSNL to look into the matter immediately.

 Sewer lines pass right along the Budge Budge public library building and emit an obnoxious stench which inconveniences visitors and staff at the library. The library secretary has been requesting the municipal authorities for the past so many years to clean the drains, but in vain. Isn?t it the duty of the civic body to maintain clean and hygienic conditions at such public places? 

 Govinda Bakshi,

 Budge Budge.

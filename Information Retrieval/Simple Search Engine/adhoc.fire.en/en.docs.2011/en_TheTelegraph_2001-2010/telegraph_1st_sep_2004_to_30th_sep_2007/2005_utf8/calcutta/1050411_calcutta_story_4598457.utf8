 Pimp twist in girl disappearance

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Pinky Das?s family members are spending sleepless nights ever since she went missing mysteriously from her Khardah home on April 2. What scares them even more is that the police suspect the 17-year-old had been kidnapped by a pimp of a red-light area.

 Pinky went missing just a fortnight after making friends with a girl named Tina. ?Tina had dropped by to meet my daughter that Saturday afternoon. In the evening, Pinky left the house but didn?t return,? said Pinky?s mother Shikha. 

 ?We don?t know where to look for her and whom to plead with for her life and safety,? she added tearfully.

 Pinky and Tina had met at a phone booth a couple of weeks ago and hit it off instantly. Pinky also came to know Tina?s boyfriend Bula. 

 ?After Pinky went missing, we went looking for Tina but were unable to locate her,? said Pinky?s brother Tapan, who runs a sweet shop. 

 Some neighbours had claimed that Bula had been seen hanging around the Das?s residence on the evening Pinky went missing.

 Pinky?s family then located Bula, who runs a CD shop at Talpukur, Barrackpore. 

 ?When we interrogated Bula, it dawned on us that Pinky could have been kidnapped,? said Tapan. 

 ?Bula revealed that Tina had introduced Pinky to a man called Bapi on Saturday evening. That was the last time he had seen her,? Tapan added. Bapi, who stays at Naihati, is a known pimp of the local red-light area.

 On April 4, Pinky?s family lodged a complaint with Khardah police station, on the basis of which Bula was arrested the next day.

 Bula provided the police with Tina?s address at Barrackpore. However, the girl was not found there. ?She had probably anticipated that the police might be on her trail and fled,? a police officer investigating the case said.

 Additional superintendent of police (Barrackpore) Manoj Verma said: ?Bula has confessed that he had been a party to the meeting between Pinky and Bapi. However, we have been unable to trace Pinky yet. A hunt is on for Bapi, who is suspected to be in Delhi, with Tina.?

 A senior police officer added: ?Bula may have come in contact with Bapi for the purpose of stocking pornographic CDs. We are constantly in touch with the police in Delhi.?

 ?Pinky was not only good-looking but also a very dynamic and ambitious girl. That is why they kidnapped her. We hope that we find her soon,? Pinky?s mother said.

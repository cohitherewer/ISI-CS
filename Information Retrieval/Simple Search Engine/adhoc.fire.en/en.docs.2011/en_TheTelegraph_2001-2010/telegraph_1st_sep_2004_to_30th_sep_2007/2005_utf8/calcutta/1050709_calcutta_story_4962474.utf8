 The state government has taken up a mega project in New Town to construct the ?state?s largest housing complex? for people belonging to the lower and middle-income groups.

 The estate will comprise 20,000 flats. While the 400-sq-ft, one-bedroom flat will be sold for Rs 3 lakh, the 700-sq-ft flat will come at double the price.

 ?It will be the largest housing estate in the state. We have already earmarked a large plot in New Town for the purpose and will soon float a nationwide tender to select builders,?? housing minister Goutam Deb told Metro on Friday.

 Though the flats will be for the financially-weaker class, the dwellings will not lack in aesthetics, the minister added.

 ?The complex will boast a unique and attractive architectural style. There will be gardens, parks and other amenities. We want to construct a mega complex that will set a precedent in the country. We will prove how beautiful houses can be built and sold at genuinely low prices,?? he said.

 Deb, who is also chairman of Hidco, the implementing agency of New Town, said 60 to 65 per cent of the total land in New Town was meant for accommodating the middle-income group (MIG), lower-income group (LIG) and the economically-weaker section. 

 This apart, he said, the majority of the flats built by various companies on joint-venture basis are for the economically-backward. These flats are sold on a no-profit-no-loss basis, Deb pointed out.

 Hidco has also decided to allot land in New Town for homes for the Anglo-Indian community. 

 ?Gilian Hart, the nominated MLA from the Anglo-Indian community, met me on Wednesday and sought land for residences for people of the community. We have decided to allot land on a cooperative basis to around 100 to 150 families,?? the minister said.

 ?Earlier, we had allotted land in New Town to the West Bengal Minorities Development and Finance Corporation for residential and commercial use by Muslims,?? he said.

 ?We have allotted land in New Town to judges, doctors, lawyers and businessmen. At the same time, we have given land or flats to the poor. This township will not cater just to the elite class,?? Deb signed off.

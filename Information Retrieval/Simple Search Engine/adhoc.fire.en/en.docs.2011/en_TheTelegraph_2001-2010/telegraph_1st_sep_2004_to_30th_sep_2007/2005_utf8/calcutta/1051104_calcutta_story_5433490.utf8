The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Govt whip on truck phase-out

 SIMI KAMBOJ

 With the December 31 deadline for phasing out pre-1990 commercial vehicles looming large, the state government is finally stepping up pressure on transport operators.

 At a recent meeting with truck operators from Calcutta, North and South 24-Parganas, and Nadia, transport minister Subhas Chakraborty urged them to prepare for the phase-out.

 ?The truckers have been told that they?ve been given enough time and that the government cannot wait forever. The department remains committed to its order on moving polluting vehicles out of Calcutta,? asserted transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury on Thursday.

 ?The transport minister told us that the communication between his department and the transport operators has been continuing for too long, and it was time for some action. We?ll discuss the matter and decide on the next step after November 6,? said Shyamal Dasgupta, working president of Truck Operators of West Bengal, who attended the October-end meeting.

 In May this year, the government had asked operators of autorickshaws and taxis of pre-1990 make to either replace them with LPG vehicles or move out of the Calcutta Metropolitan Area. Operators of pre-1990 buses and trucks were asked to go in for Bharat Stage III-compliant models.

 About 1,700 autos have been replaced by LPG-run three-wheelers so far. No more than 100 LPG taxis now ply in the city.

 General secretary of Federation of West Bengal Truck Operators? Association Satyajit Majumdar said: ?We have agreed to phase out vehicles of the pre-1975 make, but cannot accept the new cut-off date. As a mark of protest against government pressure, we?ll not ply trucks between 9 am and noon on November 18. If the pressure continues, we?ll launch an agitation by the month-end.?

 The transport department plans to issue notices to the transport operators by mid-November, asking them about the steps they are taking to meet the year-end deadline.

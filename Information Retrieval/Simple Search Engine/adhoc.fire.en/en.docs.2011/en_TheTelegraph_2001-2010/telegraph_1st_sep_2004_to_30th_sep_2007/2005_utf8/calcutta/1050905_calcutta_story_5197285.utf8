 Deadlock at film school

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The impasse at Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute (SRFTI) continued for the 10th day on Sunday, with the striking students preparing to meet film-maker Basu Chatterjee, who is also the chairman of the institute, when he comes calling on Monday.

 ?We will brief him about the situation and request a meeting with senior officers of the information and broadcasting ministry,? said Dhruba Ghosh, an outgoing student.

 Over 130 students from four batches have been on strike since August 25, protesting the ?total mismanagement and collapse of academic and administrative infrastructure? in the institute. The main building, which houses the academic and administrative wings, has been kept locked since the strike started. 

 ?We decided to go on a strike because SRFTI director Abhay Srivastava told us on August 25 that he was powerless to do anything and that the governing committee would have to decide on the steps to be taken,? added Ghosh.

 The students have decided to stay away from classes until the governing council addresses their grievances, ranging from financial irregularities to lack of planning in academic schedules. The institute does not have an active students? union. 

 ?Classes are yet to start for those who took admission last year. In fact, they haven?t even received the syllabus yet. The institute is not admitting students this year. I was supposed to have graduated last year, but my project is still some way from being completed. Every academic session stretches by four or more months. This inordinate delay has to stop,? asserted Ghosh. 

 Students want the defunct film equipment replaced, financial irregularities sorted out and the vacant faculty positions filled.

 The striking students have been in touch with Afzal Amanullah, joint secretary (film division), information and broadcasting ministry, over the telephone. According to the students, he has promised to come down to the institute. 

 A tentative campus meeting has been scheduled for September 8.

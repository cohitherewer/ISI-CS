 Items on diplay at the Japanese show

 The coveted flame streaks or ?hidasuki? of Bizen ware come from their being fired for two weeks or more in kilns of pinewood. Artists of the famed Yuzen Kimonos paint the initial drawings with blue extracts of spiderwort blossoms. Before the actual colours are applied, these drawings form the base for the lines of paint-resist pastes that are squeezed out from cones. The Hakone Marquetry ?secret box? is constructed with slabs of wood and can only be opened by moving the parts in a certain way.

 These and other bits of information filter through at the show of Japanese art and craft at the Gaganendra Pradarshashala. But that happens only after you get over the initial visual impact of seeing so many kinds of Japanese handicrafts: ceramics, textiles, items of metal, lacquer, wood, bamboo and paper.

 It?s true that the items are small and offer only a sketchy history of the handcrafted form in Japan. But then this is a travelling show, Delhi-Calcutta-Chennai being the scheduled route. The selection includes specialities from various parts of Japan ? Odate bentwood, Edo cut glass and painted paper screens, Nara writing brushes, Akama ink stones, Mino ware. The impact of the Industrial Revolution was felt in Japan since the Meji era (1868-1912) but even as machines of mass production were developed, ancient crafts were not discarded.

 They continued on a smaller scale in independent regional workshops and with time the skilled artisans were joined by individualistic college-trained artists who used the techniques for their own creations. Craft and fine arts rubbed shoulders and made for greater ingenuity and richness. The show includes items from both groups.

 Take Yokkaichi Banko porcelain and stone ware, traditionally unglazed utilitarian pieces with pictorial decorations in shallow relief, presented by master craftsman Suigetsu Shimizu. The work of ceramic artist Mikiko Tomita, a 30-plus graduate from Kyoto, is more sculptural, but with lavish doses of the Yokkaichi relief technique.

 The show brought down by the Japan Foundation will be on till December 26.

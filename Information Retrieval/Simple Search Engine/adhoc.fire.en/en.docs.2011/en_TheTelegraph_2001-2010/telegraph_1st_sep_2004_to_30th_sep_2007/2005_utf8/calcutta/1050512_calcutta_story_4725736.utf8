 Booster burden on civic coffer

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 The nine booster pumping stations ? set up at a cost of over Rs 500 crore ? will soon turn into a Rs 10-crore burden for the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, thanks to the exemption of water tax for the majority of domestic consumers.

 ?The great mistake I had to commit as mayor was to roll back the water tax under pressure from my leader (Mamata Banerjee),? said Subrata Mukherjee, who has recently broken away from Mamata?s Trinamul Congress. 

 ?Whoever becomes the next mayor, will have to reintroduce the tax on piped water for domestic users,? Mukherjee added.

 According to civic chief engineer (water supply) Dibyendu Roychaudhury, the upkeep of the nine pumping stations ? in Bagmari, Behala, Ranikuthi, Bansdroni, Gariahat, Garfa, Kasba, Watgunj and Jorabagan ? has been the responsibility of the water supply department, which also has to look after the Tallah-Palta network and the booster stations at Raja Subodh Mullick Square, Auckland Square, Mohammad Ali Park and Park Circus.

 An estimate of the water supply department suggests that each booster station consumes not less than Rs 50-lakh worth of electricity annually. The maintenance cost for each has been around Rs 20 lakh.

 An official pointed out that for the Tallah-Palta network, the civic body has to pay Rs 42 crore to CESC every year. Other expenses amount to more than Rs 30 crore.

 As only commercial users and 10 per cent of domestic consumers are required to pay water charges, the civic body raises barely 12 per cent of the expenditure incurred on electricity and upkeep.

 As more than 90 per cent of the domestic consumers are connected with ferrules of 10 mm or 15 mm, they are not levied the water tax.

 Rubbishing Mukherjee?s allegation, Trinamul spokesman Anup Chatterjee said: ?What the mayor had withdrawn under pressure was his mischief of linking the tax with the annual valuation of a landed property.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Tram track repairs a campaign plank 

 - Transit mode unites parties in poll run-up

 BARUN GHOSH

 Light rail transit system will replace the century-old trams: Left Front manifesto. 

 Calcutta Municipal Corporation will itself bear half the expenditure for renovation of tram tracks: Trinamul Congress manifesto.

 Trams and their damaged tracks will be renovated on a priority basis if the Congress-led United Democratic Alliance (UDA) is voted to power. We shall earmark a certain amount for regular maintenance of tram tracks: Subrata Mukherjee, UDA convener. 

 Calcutta?s 125-year-old trusted transport mode, which caters to over 100,000 passengers daily from Belgachhia to Joka, figures prominently in the campaign for the major political parities in the run-up to the June 19 civic elections. 

 Faced with pressure from voters, the parties have had to promise that the 68-km, crater-filled tracks will be renovated on a war footing. The people, however, are sceptical, with the tracks, which have claimed three lives since January, remaining a death trap due to lack of maintenance. 

 Mayor Subrata Mukherjee, the projected mayoral candidate of the UDA, admits that voters keep asking him why the tracks weren?t repaired in the past five years. ?It?s really embarrassing to explain that the government did not take much of an initiative on the score. If voted to power, the UDA will bear 50 per cent of the total expenditure for renovating the damaged tram tracks,? he says. 

 Candidates from the ruling Left Front are also facing awkward questions from the electorate regarding poor maintenance of the tram tracks. ?It leaves me red-faced when people inquire about the damaged tram tracks in the Mominpur-Kidderpore area,? says Nizamuddin Shams, a Forward Bloc candidate from ward 78.

 He adds that the condition of the tram tracks is as much a problem in the ward as poor supply of drinking water and lack of development in slums. 

 Sonali Guha, contesting from ward 40 (the College Square area) as a Trinamul nominee, is more vocal. ?Trams are an integral part of life in Calcutta. The ruling CPM has deliberately denied adequate funds to the Trinamul-controlled civic board of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation for the repair of tram tracks,? she complains.

 Guha, too, promises that her party, if voted to power, will renovate the entire length of the tram tracks on a priority basis. ?The condition of the tracks is a nightmare for the people who avail of trams regularly. Renovation of the tracks will be our main task after assuming power,? she says. 

 For regular commuters, particularly for the elderly, the state of the tram tracks induces fear. Octogenarian Balaram Saha, a trader in the Bowbazar area, recounts with horror his experience last week. 

 The taxi he was travelling in broke its axle after falling in a pothole and one of its wheels came off on the tram tracks along the busy BB Ganguly Street. ?All three of us in the taxi had a miraculous escape. It could have been fatal if the taxi had been hit from behind by any other vehicle,? he says.

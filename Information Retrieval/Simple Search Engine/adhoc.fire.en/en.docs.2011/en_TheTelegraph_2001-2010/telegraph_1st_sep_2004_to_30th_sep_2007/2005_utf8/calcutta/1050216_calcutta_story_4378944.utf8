Tips for testing times

 Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 According to Feng Shui, the direction you face 

while studying goes a long way to determine your success in examinations. Ideally, 

it should be one of your favourable directions, revealed by the kua number, which 

is calculated from your date of birth

Q: I have completed my Bachelors 

in electrical engineering in June 2004. My DOB is 10.10.80. I am not sure whether 

I should do MBA or Masters in engineering. Please advise. Also, what do you think 

are my job prospects right now?

Sounak De

The Solution: Your self-element is fire and 

you are coming under the influence of water from 2005 and this will continue for 

the next five years. During this period there will be major changes in your lifestyle. 

You will change your residence and there will be substantial status gain. This 

also means admission to a good college. You can comfortably go for either MBA 

or Masters in engineering. Both would be beneficial for you. Job wouldn?t be difficult 

for you in this period, but I would suggest you pursue higher education as time 

is in your favour. 

Q:I am a student of Class XII and 

my DOB is 30.10.86. What are my favourable colours, element and number. Also, 

which direction should I face while studying? 

Salekin Ahmed

The Solution: You are a strong metal person 

and your favourable colours are blue, black and green. Red can also be used in 

moderation. Your kua number is 5 and north-east, west, north-west and south-west 

are your auspicious directions in order of preference. You should face north-east 

while studying.

Q: I have not been successful in 

the last two board exams. My DOB is 04.02.82. I used to study facing the west 

wall in a room located in the north-east of the house. Now I have shifted to the 

south-east room. How can I get better results?

Sana

The Solution: You are a strong earth person 

and will benefit most from metal, water and wood elements and their related colours 

like white, blue, black and green. Don?t face west even if it is your Sheng Chi 

direction, as the Grand Duke Jupiter is residing here this year. Sit in the south-west 

of your room and face north-east while studying. Hang a picture of a god on the 

eastern wall of the north-eastern corner and keep fresh petals floating in water 

in front of it. Place a bowl filled with salt in this corner and change it everyday. 

This will help absorb the failures you are facing.

Q: I am a student of Class XII (DOB 06.01.87) 

and will appear for my board exams next year. What are my favourable colours, 

element and number?

Samar

The Solution: You are a weak wood person and 

need lots of nourishment from the water element. Surround yourself with shades 

of blue and green. Do not keep any red or triangular object in the room as these 

will drain your energy. Drink lots of water and keep a glass of water on your 

desk while studying. Spread a blue cover on your table. Your kua number is 5 and 

so north-east, west, north-west and south-west are your auspicious directions. 

You should face your Sheng Chi direction, the north-east, while studying.

Q: I am a girl born on 10.10.88 and 

will be appearing for ICSE in March. I have been a good student till Class IX, 

but this year has not been okay for me. My confidence level is going down, I have 

become lazy and am not keeping well. I occupy a room in the north-west of the 

house and face east while studying. 

A.S.

The Solution: You are a strong earth person 

and need to be balanced with metal, water and wood elements and their related 

colours like white, blue and green. Excess of earth element make you lazy. You 

have entered into your favourable metal period, which represent your intelligence 

and creativity. This means that you will excel in in 2005. Your lucky number is 

3 and auspicious directions are south, north, south-east and east. Face north, 

the direction of water, which will calm your mind and help you concentrate.

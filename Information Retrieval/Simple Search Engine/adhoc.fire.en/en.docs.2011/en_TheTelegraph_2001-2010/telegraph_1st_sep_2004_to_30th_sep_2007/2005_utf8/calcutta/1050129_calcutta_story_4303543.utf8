The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Park ticket scam under scan

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The forest department has formed an inquiry committee to identify the employees who had minted money by forging entry tickets to Banabitan, in Salt Lake. 

 Instead of selling the original tickets, these employees had traded in fake ones about a year ago.

 The inquiry follows orders from forest minister Jogesh Barman. ?I have asked my officials to probe thoroughly the allegations that some of our employees had forged Banabitan tickets,? Barman told Metro on Thursday.

 ?I don?t know who are involved in the racket. But I must condemn the practice, as these officials had deprived the state government of a chunk of its revenue,? the minister added.

 Sources in the department said the racket began its operation in mid-2003 and continued till August last year. The committee, headed by assistant divisional forest officer Goutam Chakraborty, will submit its report soon. 

 A Group-D employee of Banabitan has already been suspended as the committee feels he might influence the probe by using his links with some leaders of the staff union and a section of senior officials.

 Sources in the forest department said the committee had identified four Group-D employees who had masterminded the plan of forging entry tickets. Of every 10 tickets sold, seven were fake, the sources said. 

 The 50 acres of green in Salt Lake records a daily footfall of 2,000. The forest department earns more than Rs 20,000 a day from entry tickets, each priced at Rs 10. Morning-walkers are allowed free entry. The fee was introduced in 1996, when a ticket was priced at Rs 2. 

 The forest department has not yet estimated how much money the racket has siphoned by way of forged tickets. ?Preliminary estimates say the gang had pocketed Rs 7,000 a day before the matter came to the notice of the authorities,? said a senior forest official.

 Somnath Mukherjee, deputy conservator of forests, said the inquiry committee will soon submit its findings, on the basis of which action will be taken against the dishonest employees. 

 The park is a centre of attraction for Salt Lake residents, a large number of whom use it for their morning constitutional. It also has a waterbody spread over 15 acres.

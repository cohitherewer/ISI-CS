The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 It's Your Birthday So...

 You?re a thinker, not exactly over-confident, but loyal, a real problem-solver and respectful of family and things traditional. As a teacher, scientist or analyst, or when dealing with facts and figures, you usually excel. You?re a dreamer and a brooder ? you just cant help worrying that something isn?t just so. You are always alert about positively transforming any weakness so that it can never inhibit your growth. ? Kusum Bhandari

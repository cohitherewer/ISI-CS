The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Needed, save-city vision 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A concerted effort to protect its ?sacrosanct? urban fabric, particularly in the crumbling old quarters, and sensitive intervention ?to save its heart? can turn Calcutta into one of the ?most stunning cities? of the world, feel Kevin Tan and Stephen Coates.

 The two noted architects from Singapore-based design firm aCTa International Pte Ltd were in town on Wednesday in connection with Bengal Shrachi projects? Block by Block and Greenwood Sonata, both coming up in Rajarhat.

 ?Calcutta is among the few surviving megacities, and like Sao Paolo, Mexico City and Cairo, has a throbbing heart that needs to be preserved,? said Tan. 

 The architect has designed such distinctive ?millionaire homes? like Whitehouse Park, the Freidland residence and Glencaird Residences in Singapore.

 Tan felt Calcutta has been ?fortunate to have most of its built forms intact? since the city wasn?t subject to large-scale modernisation. ?It now needs the vision to realise its true potential and become an exciting destination on the global tourist map,? he said.

 Coates, who has been coming to Calcutta for the past six years and has also worked on Hiland Park and Sunrise Point, agrees that it?s not too late to arrest the urban decay that plagues the city?s central business district and other public spaces.

 ?Calcutta could do well to invite a global conference for critical inputs that can catalyse an integrated urban renewal,? said Coates, who has designed such landmark projects like the Fortune Plaza in Beijing and the Amerada Hess headquarters in London.

 The Singapore firm, which has recently won a major design competition in Hong Kong from five other international companies for a $ 75-million retail project, is keen to create a signature public space in the heart of Calcutta, or by the riverfront.

 ?The totally rundown General Post Office in Singapore was converted into a magnificent floating hotel and Canary Wharf in London came up from scratch. We would love to do a mixed commercial project by the river that could become Calcutta?s brand mascot,? Coates signed off.

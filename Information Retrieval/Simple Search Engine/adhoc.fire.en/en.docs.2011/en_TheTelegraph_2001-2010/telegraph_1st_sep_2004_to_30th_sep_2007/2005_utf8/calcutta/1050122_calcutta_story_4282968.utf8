 Twist to teacher death

 - Station Samaritan arrested for links with victim?s in-laws

 PRONAB MONDAL AND SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 Schoolteacher Sheela Roy was five months pregnant. Her ?accidental? death, after being hit by a train on January 13, was passed off as suicide.

 But the suicide took a murder twist after a week-long probe led to the arrest on Thursday of a man identified as Kaushik Biswas, who claimed to have witnessed the ?accident.? 

 Police found Kaushik?s movements suspicious. Though he was not related to the victim, he had been constantly by the side of her relatives at NRS Hospital for three days ? from the moment the woman was admitted there, till the post-mortem.

 ?The woman, who taught in a girls? high school in Maniktala, died under mysterious circumstances,? said Parveen Kumar, superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas. ?It seems Kaushik was deputed by the victim?s in-laws and he was trying to mislead us.?

 ?There are a number of unanswered questions that are being probed,? added superintendent Kumar. ?We have a strong suspicion that the schoolteacher was murdered. A hunt is on for all the people named in the first information report (FIR) filed by the victim?s brother, Babul Biswas.?

 Sheela, wife of Tarun Roy, who teaches English in a high school in Habra, was seriously injured after being hit by a train on January 13. 

 Kaushik, who claimed that he was waiting for a train on the platform when the accident occurred, and two others rushed her to NRS Hospital, where Sheela succumbed to her injuries around midnight.

 Sheela, however, had lodged a complaint with Barasat police station on December 5, alleging torture by her in-laws and her husband?s refusal to accept parenthood. 

 Following the complaint by her brother Babul, Dipak Roy, Tarun?s uncle and one of the five named in the FIR, was arrested. The rest of the accused ? Tarun, his father Dinanath, mother Bibha and sister Madhuri ? are absconding. 

 Police suspected Kaushik because after the accident, he pretended to be an RPF jawan and collected money by mortgaging his watch and gold rings for her treatment. 

 The investigators discovered that he was an impostor after a diary was found on him that had the phone numbers of Sheela?s in-laws. 

 Police wonder why husband Tarun claimed he was at school when he was not, and why it took him seven hours to reach the hospital after being informed of the accident.

 Ladies, the countdown to the Pujas has just got so much more exciting, with the launch of a new range of beauty products by Elizabeth Arden.

 Sheer White Skincare System, from the global cosmetic brand, was unveiled at Shoppers Stop in Forum on Tuesday afternoon. And why Calcutta as debut venue? Elizabeth Arden has been in India for the past two years and through an internal survey, the customer base for the brand was found to be the most loyal in Calcutta, revealed a spokesperson.

 As if to say thanks, the cosmetic chain has launched a pre-Puja range promising delivery of exceptional brightening results while fortifying skin health for the delivery of maximum luminescence and a supple complexion.

 Angeline Lim De Silva, international training manager of Elizabeth Arden, also paid tribute to that Calcutta woman who now swears by Elizabeth Arden, before explaining and extolling the virtues of the new products on offer.

 Delicate Asian skin is especially susceptible to the all-pervasive threat of over-exposure to ultra-violet rays of the sun, resulting in dark spots, blotchiness and discolourations that give you a dull complexion. Our products developed and tested on the Asian skin in Japan have been designed to battle the harmful effects of the suns rays with an all-natural formula combining the powerful whitening action of pure vitamim C and botanical extracts. This gently yet effectively brightens the complexion by ridding the skin layers of excessive melanin, she said.

 The secret behind Elizabeth Arden Sheer Whites ability to strengthen and improve skin textures lies in its blend of natural silk protein and grapeseed extract, De Silva said. While the Whiteners and Brighteners help reduce dark spots, and discolorations and boost the skins radiance, the Strenghteners clarify and strengthen the skin for a smooth and glowing complexion.

 Sheer White is an eight-product system needed for the routine regular cleansing-toning-moisturising regimen for a healthy look and feel.

 There is the Purifying Foaming Cleanser with skin-brightening botanicals that remove make-up and complexion dulling impurities while maintaining the skins natural moisture balance, priced at Rs 1,470.

 The Clarifying toner comes for Rs 1,430 and is useful in thoroughly removing dull, dead surface skin cells.

 For day care, Sheer White has the Illuminating Essence to provide all-round protection and repair throughout the day with its light, fast-absorbing formula penetrating deep within the skins surface to visibly improve texture and clarity of the skin. Used regularly, it helps control melanin production to reduce and prevent dark spots during the day, said the international training manager. This is priced at Rs 2,340.

 For care at night, the best time for the skin to repair and rejuvenate, there are Pure Intensive Capsules employing a pure, concentrated form of Vitamin C that would reach deep into the skin layers for an intensive whitening action. Fifty capsules: Rs 3,100.

 For the moisturising routine during the day, there is the Protective Daytime Cream with SPF 30, which improves skin clarity, strength and resilience. The SPF 30 protection provides added cover against the sun, helping to prevent dark spots, hyper-pigmentation and signs of premature ageing caused by sun exposure. The 50 ml bottle costs Rs 2,900.

 To complement the White Intensive Capsules for the night, there is the Restoring Night Cream. This lightweight cream priced at Rs 2,500 helps boost the skins moisture levels after a days exposure to environmental elements, said Angeline.

 The eighth product in this line is the Precision Spot Treatment, for Rs 1,720, whichcan help prevent the formation of future dark spots.

 All these products have been tested clinically and dermatologically. You will begin to see the results for yourself within 12 weeks of regular use, Angeline claimed.

 The Pujas may be too close, but you could well be in time for Christmas.

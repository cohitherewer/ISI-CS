The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Rituparna Sengupta and Raima Sen 

You?re fun-loving, loyal and physically active; you?re a pleasure to be with. You have weak moments too, when you over-react and impulse takes over. You are practical, and roles where you communicate, teach or design are cut out for you. You?re always ready for a good laugh and a new experience. ? Kusum Bhandari

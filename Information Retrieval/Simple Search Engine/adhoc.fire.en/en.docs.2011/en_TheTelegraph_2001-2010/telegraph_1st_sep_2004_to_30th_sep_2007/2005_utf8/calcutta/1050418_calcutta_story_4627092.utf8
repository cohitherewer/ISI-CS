 Sanjay Chakraborty: Unlike in the city proper, we do not have even one public toilet along the stretch between Taratala and route 14 bus stand. 

 This is yet another problem in the area. The construction of a toilet was proposed in the route 14 bus stand. But as the stretch has become a haven for autorickshaws, there is no space to construct a toilet. I had taken up the matter with transport minister Subhas Chakraborty. He promised that a ladies? toilet would be constructed in the route 14 bus stand or at Thakurpukur. The minister said that in case of a problems in constructing the toilet there, it would be built on a prime location on the road to ensure maximum usage.

 The Palladian Lounge at The Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry

The Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry is a 152-year-old institution located at 6 Netaji Subhas Road in the heart of Calcuttas business district. The building has been declared a heritage building and is truly an authentic and pedigreed slice of Old Calcutta. Inside some of the offices and ante-rooms of the Chamber there are priceless pieces of period furniture ? massive felt-topped office tables made of Burma teak, a centre table hewn out of a single oak tree trunk and other ornate and elegant furniture upholstered with Moroccan leather. The walls are adorned with engravings and paintings that go even further back in time and the bookshelves still contain volumes that were published in Lord Curzons days.

 You are jolted back to the present when one of half-a-dozen telephones rings and you overhear something about a Norwegian delegation visiting the city to explore the possibilities of a tie-up in the IT sector and could a booking please be made to host about 15 people on the following Monday at the Palladian Lounge, which is the very place you have come to visit.

 The said lounge is the new incarnation of The Chambers Club which used to be the place where members of the Bengal Chamber and any of its associate bodies could go and chill out, have a drink or grab a bite. Renamed The Palladian Lounge and now managed by Asian Hotels (the group to which Hyatt Regency on the Bypass belongs), it opened, in its present form, in December 2004. It is named after Andrea Palladio, a 16th Century Italian architect and founder of modern Italian architecture. He developed a style based on the classical style of ancient Rome, breaking with the ornate Italian Renaissance style. Many of the motifs and designs reflect the style of Palladio, as does the building itself. 

 The Lounge has been designed by Dulal Mukherjee; through conservative surgery, the old-world ambience of an elegant business club has been retained. The burnished copper wall panelling, the enormous old sofas and the furniture ? round dining tables and chairs and the ornate newspaper racks ? preserve a sense of the old, while the newly-laid flooring and the modernly-designed bar give the place a contemporary touch.

 Every aspect of the cuisine, the catering and other facilities at The Palladian Lounge is tailor-made to suit the office-goer and the business house or corporate body to which he or she belongs. For as little as Rs 60 (taxes extra) you can have what is called a Quick Combo which is a soup and a salad. Sounds meagre, but if it is a Minestrone Soup and a Russian Salad it is a substantial meal which fills you up without slowing you down and is serious health food as well. Minestrone is the most celebrated of Italian soups made from a variety of vegetables and pasta and served with grated Parmesan cheese. In most places in Calcutta, Russian Salad is a vegetarian item and would involve cauliflower, peas, carrots, turnip, beetroot and potatoes (all cooked) as well as tomatoes, gherkins and dollops of salad cream.

 The non-vegetarian Jumbo Combo (soup, salad and sandwich) comes for Rs 150 and although there are not very many items to choose from, the combinations can be tempting because the items are judiciously chosen. For example, a Cream of Chicken Soup, a Chicken Salami Sandwich and a Ham and Potato Salad would go down very well indeed. A plus point for the sandwiches is that the bread comes from the Hyatt Regency which has arguably the best in-house bakery in the city. 

 At the end of a days work if you feel like unwinding with a couple of drinks and a snack, they have a special offer called the Sundowner Platter, which offers a variety of kebabs and Oriental snacks. A novel item I had (not yet on the regular menu) was Chicken Chaat ? shredded chicken tikkas with onions, green chilli, ginger and coriander (all chopped) with chaat masala. Of course if you want a regular meal there is a fine a-la-carte selection as well, Indian and Continental, with some gems from the club culture days of the Raj like Spicy Roast Mutton, Grilled Bekti with Lemon Butter Sauce, Vegetable Cutlet and naturally, Fried Fish and Chips. When conference rooms are booked the catering is planned with the clients inputs but the philosophy is the same ? Indian or Old Calcutta style Continental. 

 Technically, The Palladian Lounge is for members of The Bengal Chamber and any of its associated bodies but if you just walk in for a sip and a bite, a temporary membership can be organised without much ado. 

 And though Dalhousie Square has the most amazing variety of street food, the nearest restaurants are on Waterloo Street or Bentinck Street or Mission Row. The Palladian is just a minute away from almost every office in the square.

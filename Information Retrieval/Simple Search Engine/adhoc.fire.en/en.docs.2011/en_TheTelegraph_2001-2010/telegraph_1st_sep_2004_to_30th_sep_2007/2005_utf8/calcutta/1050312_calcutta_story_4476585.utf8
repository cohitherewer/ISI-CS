 Mayor finds no beggars around

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Beggars in Calcutta are better off than those in any other city in the country. 

 Weird though it might sound, this is what Calcutta?s civic fathers would like to have you believe.

 Mayor Subrata Mukherjee claims that not a single family in the city lives below the poverty line (BPL). Even a beggar here earns more than the benchmark set by the Centre to identify the poorest segment of the population, the mayor explains. 

 At the same time, he also remarks that the BPL benchmark is unscientific and unfit for drawing up schemes to provide financial support to the urban poor.

 In conformity with a poverty-alleviation scheme the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) had been asked four years ago to submit to the Centre, through the state government, a list of BPL families whose average monthly income is not more than Rs 323.

 The list was to be used to issue special ration cards, to offer financial grant to support education programmes and to help the BPL families construct dwellings under the Ambedkar housing scheme.

 But as CMC failed to submit the list in time, the funds sanctioned for the purpose had to be returned to the Central government, alleged CPM leader of Opposition Nirmal Mukherjee. ?Mayor Mukherjee doesn?t feel for those living in slums and below the poverty line in the city,? the CPM leader said.

 In his defence, mayor Mukherjee quoted the 2001 census. It said Calcutta was inhabited by 4.58 million people, but the number of ration cards issued by the state food and supplies department in above- poverty-line (APL) category was 5.4 million, the mayor said.

 Mayoral council member (slum development) Javed Ahmed Khan said despite the fact that no family in the city lived below the poverty line, the CMC had distributed 2.5 lakh forms of the poverty alleviation scheme among the councillors. 

 They had been asked to fill up the forms after conducting surveys in the areas under their jurisdiction. 

 Four years ago, the filled-up forms were even sent to the state government. 

 However, the state government failed to publish a list of the BPL families, mayoral council member Khan explained.

 He referred to a senior citizens? scheme to substantiate the government?s attitude.

 He said that the disbursement of funds for payment of pension to poor senior citizens by the state government, under the national old age pension scheme, has remained outstanding for the past 17 months. About 22,000 persons, aged over 65 years, are entitled to the monthly Rs 100 pension, Khan said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Gallons of Corporation?s filtered water is wasted from the pipe on the pavement in front of Central Blood Bank at the Maniktala crossing. The chicken vendors who have set up shop encroaching the footpath seem to be the only people benefited by it. The wastes that they dump along the road attract insects. The authorities should seal the water pipe and evict the vendors as the slaughter and sale of chicken in the open in front of the medical institution is very unhealthy and unsafe.

 The Haldiram bus stop on VIP Road has virtually become a death trap. Strangely enough, private buses always try to overtake each other while halting at this stop. Only when a VIP passes through the area is a traffic policeman posted here. The transport department should either declare the stop unauthorised or make provisions to safeguard the lives of the passengers by deploying cops and installing traffic lights.

 It would be of great help to the ailing humanity in the city if the Indian Medical Association, Calcutta, publishes a directory containing the addresses and telephone numbers of all hospitals and practising physicians in Calcutta.

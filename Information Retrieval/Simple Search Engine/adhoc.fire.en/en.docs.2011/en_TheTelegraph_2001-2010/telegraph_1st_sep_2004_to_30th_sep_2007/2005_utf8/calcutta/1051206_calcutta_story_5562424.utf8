 Lock-up leaks convicts

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Tricking a guard into opening the lock-up gate, three accused in murder and attempt-to-murder cases escaped from police custody in Howrah early on Monday.

 The lock-up gate made of thick iron bars and netting at Howrah?s Dasnagar investigation centre opens on to the duty officer?s room. The gate has no casement. 

 One of the detainees asked for water. A guard opened the gate to give him a bucket of it. Instantly, the four detainees gave the gate a push, ?overwhelmed? the guard, stepped into the duty officer?s room, opened a wooden door and ran on to Alamohan Das Road.

 The guards chased them and managed to catch hold of one; but the other three escaped. At that time, there were at least 25 policemen in the barracks on the investigation centre?s premises. 

 ?Three officers of the investigating centre were suspended. We have launched a departmental inquiry into the matter,? said Kalyan Banerjee, additional superintendent of police (town), Howrah.

 Earlier this year, the men had stolen a car and murdered its driver, and held up a Orissa petrol station and fled with Rs 27,000. Police caught all three Bihar residents ? Pramod Prasad, Sanjay Singh and Shyamsundar Pathak ? and brought them to Howrah. There they met Soven Majumdar, held in an attempt-to-murder case.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 she?s got the look

 - eye catcher

 It?s a tale of two beauties trying to make Calcuttans more beautiful. But one?s in front of the camera, the other?s behind it. If Raima Sen is the face for Swapnasundari, Rituparna Sengupta is the brain behind the beauty show for Akash Bangla. ?I have conceptualised the show, but I won?t come before the camera because I am too busy with a host of projects. I will be giving tips, though?? smiles Rituparna, whose company Bhavna Aaj O Kaal has taken up the initiative. Cramming in everything from make-up tips to fashion trends, beauty experts, hair stylists and designers will hold forth on how to dress up for a party or to get the right look for an afternoon do. ?I did it for Rituparna?? chirped Raima, who spent Wednesday shooting the promotional track for Swapnasundari. But there will be more of Raima ? she is currently in town to shoot for Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury?s Anuranon ? on TV soon. By December-end, she starts working for a telefilm to be directed by Rituparno Ghosh, whose Khela she has just wrapped up. Picture by Aranya Sen

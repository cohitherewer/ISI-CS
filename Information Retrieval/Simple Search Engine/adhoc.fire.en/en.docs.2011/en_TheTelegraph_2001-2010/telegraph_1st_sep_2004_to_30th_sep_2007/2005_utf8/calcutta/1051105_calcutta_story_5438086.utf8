 Mob rage over deaths in hospitals

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Mob violence ignited in two hospitals after two patients died of alleged medical negligence at SSKM Hospital and the National Medical College and Hospital on Friday.

 The mobs assaulted doctors and ransacked the emergency unit and general medicine wards of both hospitals. Relatives of the deceased and the doctors lodged complaints with the police.

 At SSKM Hospital, attending doctor S.S. Chatterjee lodged a complaint with Tollygunge thana, alleging that kin and friends of a deceased patient were calling up his residence and threatening him. 

 No one has been arrested but a senior officer said a vigil was being maintained around Chatterjee?s house.

 According to records available at SSKM, 53-year-old Noor Islam Mandal, a resident of Brahmapur, on the city?s southern fringes, was admitted with a heart ailment. He was kept in the intensive care unit under Chatterjee. Mandal underwent angioplasty on Thursday. He was found dead the next morning.

 ?Chatterjee said he had died of a cardiac arrest and there was nothing wrong with his treatment. We told the doctors that he had uncontrolled diabetes, apart from other complications, but no one would listen to us,? said Mujahid Gaji, Mandal?s brother-in-law.

 Trouble broke out at the other hospital after 65-year-old Safikul Ahmed died two hours after admission. 

 ?He died of a massive heart attack. Doctors can?t be blamed for it,? said hospital superintendent Mrityunjoy Mukherjee. Safikul?s kin went on the rampage, beating up junior doctors. 

 A police team from Beniapukur stopped the mob from doing further damage.

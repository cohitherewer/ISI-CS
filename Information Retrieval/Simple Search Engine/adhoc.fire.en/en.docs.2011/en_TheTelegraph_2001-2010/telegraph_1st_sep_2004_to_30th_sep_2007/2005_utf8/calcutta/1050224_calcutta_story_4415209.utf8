The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

LO-CAL

Derek O'Brien

Last week I played tourist guide. First, to a long-lost 

cousin and her husband from Lahore (yes, I do have a few paternal relatives in 

Pakistan) and then ? over the weekend ? to an old friend, now a physiotherapist 

in London. I took my job of showing them the ?new Calcutta? very seriously. Up

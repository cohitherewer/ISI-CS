 The spate of fatal road accidents in recent times has prompted Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s government to sit up and take action.

 ?We are trying to strengthen Calcutta?s traffic system. To do this, we?ll soon take up a comprehensive traffic management system,? Bhattacharjee announced on Wednesday afternoon at Writers? Buildings. He was reacting to a query on the rising count of casualties, primarily on account of rash driving across the city.

 On the agenda, Bhattacharjee said, is an automatic signalling system along all major corridors, road railings, bus bays and zebra crossings throughout the city.

 ?In the first phase, we?ve sanctioned Rs 2.5 crore. The system will later be replicated in all 100 wards in Calcutta proper. Another Rs 5 crore will be required in the second phase. We?ve also planned some beautification work for which we will seek participation from the corporate sector,? said the chief minister.

 Transport experts were of the opinion that the automatic signalling system may not succeed in addressing problems. 

 Bhattacharjee refused to comment on whether pedestrians were solely responsible for the recent accidents. Maintaining that he was constantly in touch with the city police commissioner, Bhattacharjee said: ?This should be our gift to the people of Calcutta. Calcutta Police is celebrating 150 years, but the past is history. It?s time we did something basic and meaningful on the occasion. For this, the transport department will work in tandem with the traffic police.?

 As part of its 150-year celebrations, the city police has planned a host of activities ranging from revamping its museum, decking up offices of the traffic guard, sprucing up police stations and purchasing a battery of new vehicles, including motorcycles and jeeps for senior officers across 48 police stations.

 According to Bhattacharjee, the city?s rising vehicle count is also cause for concern. ?We have only about six per cent roadspace, but there is no law to curb the rising number of vehicles on our roads,? he said.

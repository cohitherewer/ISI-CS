The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Buck up, boys amp; girls

Calcuttas fittest and fastest youth buckled up 

for the climb to Mt Everest base camp. Young Metro caught the hopefuls 

in action, sweating it out in the afternoon sun

 It was high noon and the sun was at its ferocious best, beating down on the youths assembled at Vivekananda Park. Theirs was a tale of dirt and grime, speed and agility, fuelled by dreams of ice-capped Mt Everest. 

 The Calcutta leg of the Thums Up Hai Dum? Everest Challenge had drawn a sizeable 430 participants. With the pull of a trip to the Everest base camp for the national winner and a two-wheeler for the city finalist, it was no surprise that some of Calcutta?s sturdiest youngsters had lined up for the challenge. Many, like a group from Bhowanipore, had reached hours before the scheduled start. 

 The first test was a 200 m run, followed by sit-ups ? as many as one?s lungs permitted. This separated the men from the boys. And the two supergirls from the dozen-odd girls. Fifty-six made it to the next endurance round. 

 The first obstacle was the net crawl ? dragging oneself across 20 ft on elbows. Though most made it easily, those who touched the net above had to repeat the exercise and lost out on precious seconds. 

 Scaling a 10-ft wall was easier. Next was the Tarzan swing ? getting on a podium, grabbing hold of a rope and landing across a finishing line 10 ft away, with or without the apeman?s yell. This was the trickiest, causing most to fall, well short. Some even failed to land and swung right back, causing the gaggle of curious on-lookers to break into giggles. Kiron Das, from Chandernagore, was stopped here. ?You need body weight to gain the momentum,? the lean young man said, wistfully eyeing a squat figure making a perfect landing. His friend Md Akbar, 23, had just finished the round successfully. ?Five of us have come from the Chandannagore Mountaineering Institute. We do artificial climbing at Salt Lake stadium,? he added. 

 Another group had come from Areat Mountaineering Foundation in Barasat. ?We hope to do well,? said Subhankar Das, 21.

 There were uninitiated walk-ins, too. Like Krishnagopal Mandhana of City College. Out jogging at the Lakes, he spied the activity and enrolled. While Mandhana managed to complete the round, having to repeat only the Tarzan swing, Arijit Sarkar of Delhi University stopped well short. Nothing would persuade him, out of breath and covered with bruises, to take a shot at the balancing pole, up next.

 The biggest cheer was reserved for Ranju Chakraborty, one of the two girls who completed the round. 

 Though the teens and 20s reigned in numbers, it was 42-year-old tourist guide Debabrata Mukherjee who touched the Thums Up board at the top of an artificial rock the fastest. He took home the bike and the ticket to the Shivpuri (near Rishikesh) training camp.

 At the camp, he will be joined by 14 other finalists from across the country for a two-week training by Col. Narendra Kumar, former principal of Himalayan Mountaineering Institute. But going by the warning issued by Pankaj Trivedi of India Outdoors, the organisers, Calcutta is far behind the other centres they have so far been to in terms of timing. So, Bengal has to buck up, if the flag at the base camp has to flutter from this part of the world.

What?s on your mind this week

Colour 

splash

A holiday is generally a day set aside for celebration 

or remembrance. Holi is the festival of colours. It symbolises the victory of 

good over evil. People celebrate it joyously by throwing colour on each other. 

But of late, people have not been celebrating it as enthusiastically as in the 

past. Phag, which announces the beginning of spring, has lost its importance. 

Those who used to sprinkle colour don?t bother anymore. I hope to have a joyous 

Holi this time with some mouthwatering, lipsmacking snacks and thandai. 

Happy Holi!

 Beyond borders

Sometimes I wonder why we can?t stop spinning a web 

of discussions and debates to enjoy cricket as just a game. Is it always necessary 

to invite a group of renowned people to analyse how a cricket match is improving 

or deteriorating relationships between two countries? There is no need for any 

improvement and I can vouch for it. Our visit to Pakistan last year, on a peace 

mission organised by TTIS, is a memory that each one of us who were a part 

of it will cherish for years to come. Or for that matter, ask anyone who has visited 

our neighbouring country and they will surely agree with me. There is no hatred 

prevailing in the minds of the people, the fault lies elsewhere. So, are we not 

exaggerating a trivial issue by hosting panel discussions?

 Mighty win

Three cheers to Team India on the win in the second 

Test match against Pakistan at Eden Gardens by a mighty margin of 195 runs. Fans 

witnessed an excellent game and a brilliant display of cricketing talents by both 

India and Pakistan. India being the better side deserved the win, the architects 

of which were Rahul ?The Wall? Dravid and Anil Kumble. The vice-captain?s scintillating 

centuries of 110 and 135 couldn?t have come at a more apt time. Kumble continued 

to dismantle the Pakistani batsmen with his awesome bowling. Hats off to the two 

maestros. The triumph was a tad marred by umpire Steve Bucknor?s faulty decision 

regarding Sachin Tendulkar?s wicket, but that could not deter the Indians from 

scripting a dramatic win. Indian fans will now watch with bated breath the final 

Test. Sourav Ganguly can plan another win.

 Exam fright

Before the annual exams, students become increasingly 

nervous and frightened, which leads to suicide. The the pressure causes frustration. 

Students use ?key books?, answer guides and other published ?tips to successful 

exams?. This is not the right thing to do. The system of education in India is 

impractical. If a student wants to study science in future, why should his brain 

be taxed by subjects like history and geography? It is important to know the history 

and geography of one?s country, but the compulsion should end after Class VIII. 

More than 70 per cent of students do poorly in Indian languages, but they are 

still mandatory. If a student wishes to take up science, he should be given the 

scope to cultivate his interest. It is also sad that the work pressure and study 

load is so much that students end up frustrated and frightened. If the Board changes 

the syllabus, the rate of suicide among students will fall.

 Forbidden treats

 My happiest school memories are of returning home in our sturdy old mottled green Ambassador, gleefully savouring a rupee?s worth of amra and churan, and feeling deeply content with the knowledge that another rupee?s worth of churan lay securely tucked away in my school bag. The most cherished moments of my school days were those spent just outside the school gate, carefully choosing from an array of dubious-looking but lipsmacking array of delicacies. 

Various kinds of churan, chaat, the slightly more respectable candy floss and utterly disreputable phuchkas. My mother has unfortunately never been able to appreciate these delightful goodies, and she forbade me to go anywhere near these vendors. But the driver was an understanding confidante. He deliberately came late, allowing me precious moments to purchase some delectable forbidden treats.

 The churanwalla was (and still is) my favourite. Being a timid Bengali, I never ventured beyond amra and churan. But I recently discovered many more finger-licking albeit ominous-looking goodies, such as the coal-coloured aam papad, sticky mango achar (which looks suspiciously like pickled scorpion legs), some awful but fascinating sweet cigarettes and utterly disrespectable hojmi goli. The prices have increased since I passed out of school. But judging by public demand, the churanwalla still seems to be the reigning school favourite.

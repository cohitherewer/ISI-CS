 After ogling the mesmerising Mumait Khan a couple of weeks ago, the party people of Calcutta were treated to some raunchy moves by the sizzling Rakhi Sawant on Saturday night at Tantra.

 The night was aptly named Fatal Attraction as casualties ran high. Men swooned en masse when the item-number babe from Mumbai started her performance well past midnight.

 The provocative act was performed in two sequences with an interval of an hour between the performances. As Rakhi jived to tracks like Kaanta laga, Meri beri ke ber mat todo, Mungra and Choli ke peechhe, the cell phone shutterbugs went berserk and the guys just couldn?t stop gaping.

 Bandeh beats

 Black Friday may never see the light of day, but Calcutta came alive with the film soundtrack Bandeh this Friday night. Indian Ocean, the band that composed the music for the film, regaled a full house at Someplace Else with its brand of folk rock, Indian classical and jazz sound. 

 The band launched into its act bang on time at 9.30 pm, propelling pub-hoppers into an early-bird mood. The tiny pub was jam-packed and late comers had to be satisfied without an eyeful of the veteran band, more than 15 years old now. Lovers of folk music and those who dig yesterday?s sound were treated to quite an earful though.

 The quartet comprising Asheem Chakravarty on percussion and vocals, Susmit Sen on guitar and vocals, Amit Kilm on drums and Rahul Ram on bass and vocals belted out an almost two-hour-long gig that took in everything from their hugely popular Jhini, Kandisa and now Bandeh to other hits like Khajuraho, Kya maloom, Leaving home, Village damsel, Hille le, Bhor and more.

 While Indian Ocean fans sang along to most of the numbers, those who tuned in fresh were quite receptive to the sound as well. 

 ?The music is growing on me!? remarked a German guest who then demanded to know the meaning of the lyrics. One could only mumble that most of it was in Sanskrit, which was Greek not just to him!

 Friday style

 Fashion Fridays! That?s the way Calcutta?s party circuit is kick-starting its weekends. If the third week of fashion fiesta at Prince of Cal, the lounge of Sourav?s: The Food Pavilion was any indication, then fashion fever has Calcutta in its grip.

 The weekly platform at Sourav?s saw six fresh names showcasing their talent over two hours at the lounge. As city models ramped around the night haunt in everything from ethnic saris to summer shorts, labels Bombay Silk, Sreejoyi, I.Creative, Nextiles, Darbari and Colour?s Fab found their place under the arclights too.

 A mix of Italian crepes and French chiffons were brought to the floor by Bombay Silk, while tussar wraparounds and saris by Joyeeta Basu revealed a range of fabric and design techniques.

 The evening look for the woman who likes to drape herself in six yards of magic was created by Subhasish and Manisha Dutta. Darbari showcased western and fusion clothes. 

 A parallel style show was on at the same time at Starstruck retro lounge and was well-attended, too.

 The fun really began, though, after the show got over with the crowd rocking to hip- hop numbers and binging on some great food at the adjoining restaurant. Actresses Koneenica, Deboleena, Swastika, Rachana, Locket and Indrani were among those who came to share the Friday fun. 

 Melody man

 Ghulam Ali has always been a favourite among Calcutta?s music-loving elite. And his latest performance at Hyatt Regency, on the occasion of the post-launch party of New Approach?s latest publication hosted by owner Sekhar Basu Roy, proved the ghazal singer?s unwavering popularity in town.

 The banquet hall, filled to capacity, had some of the biggest names in Calcutta?s social circuit nursing their drinks and soaking in the melodies rendered by the maestro.

 Bollywood badman Prem Chopra, nice guy Farookh Sheikh, frizzy-haired singer Penaaz Masani and actress Shabana Azmi were some of the dignitaries who trooped in to hear the golden voice. ?Main Penaaz ki baat nahin taal sakta, woh bachhi hai hamari (I can?t ignore Penaaz?s wishes, she?s like my child),? said Ali, while responding to a request made by her. 

 Steering clear of his popular hits like Chupke chupke raat din and Hungama hai kyun..., he presented a brand new song list, some of which he sang for the very first time. ?The Calcutta audience has a discerning ear for music and it?s always lovely to present new things here,? he smiled.

 Hot numbers for sizzling footwork

 Amitabh Bachchan, Aishwarya Rai and Abhishek Bachchan rock IIFA Awards 2005. The trio appear in the same frame in Bunty Aur Babli; (below) Katrina Kaif is the cool face of Just chill, the hot number from Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya ruling the discos now 

 Dance tracks have a limited console life, remix rage notwithstanding. The vagaries of the party people keep disc jockeys on their toes as well. Keeping pace with new releases, Goodlife lists the hottest tracks to pack the floors in coming weeks. 

 Song: Kajrare

 Movie: Bunty Aur Babli

 Club call: Kajrare, with a qawali feel, is already catching up with Bollywood buffs. Its a progressive track, which starts off slow and takes you on a high towards the end, says DJ Akash. 

 Fact file: The movie may not have lived up to the expectations garnered by the star quotient but the music by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy is here to stay, ruling the DJ console.

 High point: Big B, Baby B and ex-miss world Aishwarya Rai in the same frame. Alisha Chinai makes a comeback.

 Song: Just chill

 Movie: Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya

 Club call: From the opening phrase Just chill onwards, the song exudes oodles of bindaas feel. However, the track may not lure slightly older people to the dance floor, feels DJ Harish. 

 Fact file: The film, directed by comedy king David Dhawan, has an interesting star cast comprising Salman Khan, Sohail Khan, Arshad Warsi, Sushmita Sen and Katrina Kaif, with music by Himesh Reshammiya.

 High point: The happy-go-lucky feel of the number. 

 Song: Dus bahane

 Movie: Dus

 Club call: This is one number that is sure to replace the raw energy of Dhoom machale. In fact, it is more fast paced than the previous hit, fortells DJ Akash.

 Fact file: The girls have Abhishek Bachchan and Zayed Khan to drool over with Suniel Shetty and Sanjay Dutt bringing up a macho rear. The boys have eye candy in Shilpa Shetty, Esha Deol and Raima Sen. 

 High point: The rock roll vibe of the number, by the Vishal and Shekhar duo.

 Song: Nach baliye

 Movie: Bunty Aur Babli

 Club call: It has become a Saturday night special. The song is racy and incorporates the phrase dance floor quite a few times, grins DJ Girish.

 Fact file: The chemistry between Abhishek Bachchan and Rani Mukherjee is palpable in the song. 

 High point: Punjabi lyrics with disco beats.

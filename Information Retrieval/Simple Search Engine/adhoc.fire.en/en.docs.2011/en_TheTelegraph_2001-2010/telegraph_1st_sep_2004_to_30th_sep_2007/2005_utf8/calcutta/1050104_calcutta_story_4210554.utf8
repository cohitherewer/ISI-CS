 Jason and Kashmira: Awesome twosome

 The star of Sex and the City Season 6 Jason Lewis was recently back in Mumbai to wrap up the shooting of Bollywood Bride, the Hollywood venture also starring Kashmira Shah and Sanjay Suri. Like a good Indian host, music director Anu Malik asked him over for tea. And guess what tune the Hollywood hunk ended up humming? Dil ko hazar bar roka roka roka? ?I was playing some of my songs and he just loved that one,? laughs a pleased-as-punch Malik, who is doing one song for Bollywood Bride. Now that is what being a good guest is all about. 

 Malik is on cloud nine these days, talking of his voyage to American shores via the Brad Listermann project after his English venture Bride and Prejudice. This new year is seeing him getting ready to start work on his third firang film Mistress of Spices, starring Aishwarya Rai and produced by Paul Burgess, husband of Gurinder Chadha. 

 As for Jason Lewis, it is most likely that we will see him on the big screen earlier than on the small. It is the third season of Sex and the City that is coming this January. Brace yourselves for more escapades as Carrie, Miranda, Samantha and Charlotte return in the popular serial. The late night weekend marathon features two back-to-back episodes after the HBO Friday blockbuster. The three weekend nights are followed by a single episode every Wednesday after the 9 pm movie. The lissome foursome come beaming from January 14 on HBO.

 Not every 12-year-old gets to gift a trip abroad to his or her parents. Not unless one is a Richie Rich of comic strips. 

 So J. Swarnashruti of Mumbai surely belongs to a rare breed. The girl from Mumbai has emerged as a winner in Hungama TV?s Kids Ka Kamaal contest. Thanks to her, the entire family will holiday in Malaysia. Adding to her delight was the fact that her favourite actor Aamir Khan handed over the prize. 

 The contest gives kids an opportunity to gift their parents a flat, a family car, shopping vouchers and a diamond set in addition to the vacation. 

 Kids across India need to answer the questions asked on the channel everyday between 4 and 8 pm. They can SMS their answers to 8558 or call 190 2424 8558 or log on to www.hungamatv.com. 

 But first, they have to create their own lucky number by jotting down the six numbers of their mother?s date of birth followed by the six numbers of their father?s birth date. This is unique to every kid and the lucky number will be the entry ticket to the contest.

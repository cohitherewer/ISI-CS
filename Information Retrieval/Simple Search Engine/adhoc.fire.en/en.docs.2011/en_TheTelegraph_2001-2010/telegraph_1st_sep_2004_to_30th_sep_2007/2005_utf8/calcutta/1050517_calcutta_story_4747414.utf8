The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 In memory of a forgotten martyr

Dance Dance: Boys and girls from different schools in Calcutta 

danced till they dropped on stage at Techno Boogie, the western dance competition 

of Syzygy 2005, the annual fest of the Computer Club of La Martiniere for Boys, 

held from May 13 to 15. Picture by Rashbehari Das

 He lived for 24 years, 11 months and 7 days. He was imprisoned four times for going against the British. The last 63 days of his life he spent without taking even a single drop of water. He lived like a soldier and died like a hero. But on his birth centenary recently, the country, even his hometown (though he considered himself an Indian before a Bengali) forgot to remember him. This is what patriotism really is to a state that suffers from pseudo-patriotism during cricket and football matches. 

 Jatindra Das (better known as Shaheed Jatin Das) fasted for 63 days till he died, protesting the inhuman torture of Indian freedom fighters in British prisons. Once before, he had fasted for 21 days for the same purpose. Jatin Das is only the second person in history to have laid down his life by fasting for the freedom movement. He also holds the record to have fasted for the most number of days.

 The inmates of 1 Amita Ghosh Road (Jatin Das Smrity Bhavan, though Jatin Das never lived here) have got plenty to complain about. Except a Metro Railway station named after him, there is hardly anything permanent in Calcutta in memory of the martyr. ?Except for a few commemorations by some private initiatives, there have hardly been any remembrance programmes,? said Milan Kumar Das, nephew of Jatin Das and also the assistant secretary of Shaheed Jatin Das Smrity Samity. 

 A remembrance programme held by the Smrity Samity was attended by MP Md Salim. And only about 20 people gathered there. Even Mitra Institution, Bhowanipore, where Jatin Das studied, remained inert. ?When we approached the school authorities for a programme, they turned us down,? said a crestfallen Milan Kumar Das. Only Asutosh College, which he attended, showed respect by putting up a statue of the martyr. 

 Repeated requests to the Centre to put up a picture of Jatin Das in Parliament along with other freedom fighters were also unheeded. ?Kiran Chandra Das, my father and Jatin Das?s brother, had made a personal request to Jawaharlal Nehru,? added Das. Living in a country that promises to be one of the largest economies in the world in a few years, it?s time we understood what the word ?independence? means. Imagine what would have happened if there were no freedom fighters like Jatin Das.

 Technical talk

Total quality management (TQM) in higher education 

in the country is the need of the hour. Keeping this in mind, a daylong national 

seminar on implementation of TQM in higher education was organised by JD Birla 

Institute and Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) on May 7. 

 Divided into two broad sessions, it revealed some interesting facts. The seminar emphasised the importance of hard work (for success), education (for the nation?s development) and knowledge (for personality development). 

 Gautam Chatterjee of the CII and Prof Suman Mukherjee of JD Birla Institute delivered the keynote address. Session I commenced on the theme Assessment and Beyond: Academia Experience, with eminent personalities from different colleges all around India expressing their opinions. 

 The second session, on Industry Experience, had a professional from Tata Steel relating his experiences on initiating the implementation of TQM in 46 schools in Jamshedpur. Next was the panel discussion on challenges of implementing TQM, with eminent personalities from universities and colleges locking horns. 

 The seminar enlightened us on the basic issues relating to TQM and its importance in higher education.

IEM Science amp; Technology Cell (ISTC) organised

and security, wireless communication, speech/image coding and processing, signal 

theory and digital signal processors. 

 Jawahar Sircar, principal secretary, higher education department, and Prof M.K. Mukherjee, engineering, IEM, delivered interesting lectures. The inaugural session concluded with a vote of thanks by director Satyajit Chakroborti. Next were the technical and tutorial sessions, including guest lectures by eminent professors and paper presentation by students of IEM on communications. 

 The students? papers were presented in two ways ? poster presentation and open (PowerPoint) presentation. The papers presented were put on CDs and given to each group of participants and to everyone who was a part of the conference. 

 The most exciting part was the participation of the undergraduate students, with the budding engineers talking about their new ideas.

 Tagore tributes

Rabindra Jayanti celebrations at Loreto College this 

year had a special sparkle. With exams consuming the energies of students, the 

professors took it upon themselves to organise a programme. The theme was Tagore 

the Patriot. There were renditions, readings and recitations of portions from 

Tagore?s oeuvre, which highlighted the bard?s notion of the nation as the motherland. 

Songs like Ekla cholo re, readings from essays like Nationalism in India 

and poems like Bharat Tirtha, stirring up emotions. It was an enchanting 

half hour of music and memories, a fitting tribute to one of the greatest sons 

of Bengal.

Ponchishey Baishakh is one of the very few days in 

a year when modern Bengalis prefer George Biswas to George Harrison, and tune 

into Rabindrasangeet. Clearly evident from the large crowd of students, both present 

and former, that gathered in front of Nava Nalanda school to pay tribute to Rabindranath 

Tagore, on the bard?s birth anniversary. 

 Eminent artistes rendered Tagore?s songs and recitals. Among those present were Indranil Sen, Swagatalakshmi Dasgupta, Indrani Sen, Saikat Mitra, Shaonli Mitra, Pradip Ghosh, Bratati Bandopadhay and Pranati Thakur. The second part featured student performances. Most popular was the primary students? rendition of Ore grihobashi khol dwar khol laglo je dol. There were recitals and dances besides songs like Aamar sonar bangla and Ami bhoy korbo na. Around 600 school students participated.

 The third and final day of the prelims of The Great TTIS Challenge, presented by Himani Sona Chandi, held at Rotary Sadan, ended on a high note on Monday, with the participating teams in Unconventional Orchestra making just the right noises.

 The elimination round of the Eastern Solo (music) competition, boasting over 120 participants, starting at 9.30 am and took around five hours. 

 Later in the day, Chanelle, a 21-year-old former student of Assembly of God Church School, kicked off the Unconventional Orchestra belting out some rocking numbers.

 The students took the stage with their innovative music-making tools. From plastic mugs and earthen vessels to glass bowls and stationery, the judges and the audience were clearly stumped by the creativity that the youngsters displayed in using otherwise mundane items of daily use to make melody.

 ?They were all very talented. Many can take up percussion as a career if they are serious about it. Also, I think more girls should team up to make music. There were very few today,? pointed out Chanelle, who was also on the panel of judges for the event.

 Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan mesmerised the audience for well over the stipulated three minutes with a novel use of metal measuring tapes and antenna rods.

 While Sunrise School used a pair of school shoes to produce the tap dance effect and featured a waste bin as a drum, the Future Foundation boys churned out African tribal beats with household items such as a vegetable peeler and a hair brush.

 ?At school, the desks and tables are what we play on. After watching the other teams, we have now decided to use more vocal sounds if we make it to the finals,? said one of the Class VII students of Future Foundation.

 On Friday ? the second day of the The Great TTIS Challenge prelims ? Street Play saw some brilliant performances on the theme of child rights. Hindol Bhattacharya of the South Point team, which has qualified in the category for the finals at the fest-cum-carnival, said: ?We staged Iqbal ki Kahani. It is the story of how a child labourer, Iqbal, gets killed after getting trapped in a clash between goons. We wanted to show grim reality, rather than dwell on fantasy.?

 Calcutta Girls?, however, is confident that it is a front-runner in the category. ?Unlike other teams, we presented a proper street play which addressed and involved the audience, complete with flower formations and simple dialogues,? pointed out Navdha Taparia and Shilpa Asopa of Class XII.

 In the Western Group (music) competition on Friday, MB Girls? stood out because of its original compositions. While many teams stuck to the Boyzone and Backstreet Boys genre, a few also ventured into Pink Floyd and Ozzy Osbourne.

 All the teams and individuals that go to the finals have 10 points to their credit. So, starting December 15, all the qualifiers stand an equal chance of bagging the top honours.

 While the teams have already plunged into planning for The Great TTIS Challenge finals at Swabhumi, individual winners are adding up their chances of becoming the Champion of Champions.

 Stuti Agarwal, a Class XII student of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, shared: ?I have made through War of RJs and Turn Coat, while my school has cleared Ad Spoof. I might have a chance in Champion of Champions if I do well in the finals.?

 Many others are keeping their fingers crossed. Shuvayan Chanda of Class XI of Methodist School, who has qualified in Turn Coat (debate), said: ?More than preparation, it is the presence of mind and presentation that count here.?

 Chit Chat

 Goodbye

 He was filled with insecurities 

 when the stranger came inside, 

 his body trembled despite his imposing size.

 Nausea filled his belly 

 as he heard them mention no other choice,

 raw panic stirred in his veins just then.

 He silently screamed ?Don?t take me away?,

 his eyes begged and pleaded, ?I like it here,

 I won?t bother anyone, I promise.?

 Unfortunately, he couldn?t speak, 

 and no one looked at his eyes,

 all he could do was hang his head

 as the uniformed man placed the

 chain around his neck and dragged him away,

 tail between his legs, the door shut behind him

 in an abrupt and final ?goodbye?.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

?I wanted to bring Amitji out of the star trap?

Having failed to deliver after Vaastav, director 

Mahesh Manjrekar hopes to return strongly with Viruddh. He speaks to Pratim 

D. Gupta about the Amitabh-Sharmila-starrer and his solo act in Struggler

 Mahesh Manjrekar with Amitabh Bachchan and 

Sharmila Tagore at the launch of Viruddh, to release this Friday, and (below) 

with Laloo Prasad Yadav and Johnny Lever on the sets of Padmashree Laloo Prasad 

Yadav 

After your recent failures in Rakht and 

Padmashree Laloo Prasad Yadav, you seem to be back to your Nidaan days 

with Viruddh?

Yes, you can say that. Viruddh has no commercial 

elements, no comedy scenes, no song-and-dance. It is a sensible film about a family 

to be enjoyed by families. There?s nothing impractical that happens in the movie. 

Every person in the audience can identify with the characters. They are very, 

very real. There are people like the ones Amitabh Bachchan and Sharmila Tagore 

play in the movie, people whom you encounter every day. I enjoyed doing the film 

and watching it too.

Where did you get the idea of a couple struggling 

to cope with their son?s death?

I know about a couple ? a friend from my theatre days 

? who had a very happy family till one fine day their son died in a scooter accident. 

Now, how do you cope with that? They had always seen the son as their support. 

They wanted to see his children and he was now gone. So, from there on it was 

all about the two being there for each other. They have been my inspiration. I 

have made my screen couple a little bit stronger. 

Why did you cast Amitabh Bachchan in such a common 

man role?

Only one person can carry that heavy load, only one 

person can compel the audience to watch and listen and that?s Amitji. I 

started off writing the film with Amitji in mind. Post-Kaante, I 

was in a hurry to make a film with him. Like all directors I was dying to work 

with him. So he was an automatic choice. 

But why Sharmila Tagore, who has been largely missing 

from the Bollywood scene?

Primarily because I wanted a different pairing with 

Amitji and the chemistry to be different. Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini 

have a very good chemistry but people have seen them together before many times. 

In fact, my first choice was Jayaji, but they too have come together on 

screen quite often, including the recent Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham. So, 

Sharmilaji would be kind of a surprise. Even in their heydays they didn?t 

do that many films. 

Also, Sharmila Tagore, everyone remembers for An 

Evening In Paris and Chupke Chupke. Nobody remembers her for Apur 

Sansar, Mausam and Amar Prem. These films show that she can 

deliver if she gets the scope. She has done a marvellous job in Viruddh 

and is an ace up my sleeve.

Why are you stressing on the fact that the story 

of Viruddh is set in the middle class?

I call myself middle class. I believe that whatever 

changes a middle-class man goes through or whatever luxuries he gets, at the end 

of the day he remains middle-class. Today, even the government is elected by the 

middle-class. The upper class celebrates the election-day as a holiday and the 

lower class doesn?t vote intelligently. Middle-class is also the only people who 

pay their taxes since it gets directly cut from their salaries. And despite all 

this they are the most neglected section because they are tolerant. They have 

a smile for everything. Their pride lies in the family structure and Viruddh 

is all about that structure remaining unchanged.

Do you think people would go to watch a middle-class 

Bachchan within a week of his larger-than-life turn as Sarkar?

Amitji and I sat down and discussed this. See, 

as a star you have many traps and one of them is being bracketed in a certain 

genre. Then again, films are never written for any actor. Keeping all that in 

mind, I wanted to present Amitji in this manner and bring him out of the 

star trap.

Also, when I made Nidaan with unknown faces, 

10 people came to see the film. I am still very proud of the film. Also, hardly 

anyone went on to see my other sensible films like Ehsaas and Tera Mera 

Saath Rahein. So I have realised that it?s a big waste if nobody comes to 

see your movies. I think a lot of people will come in to watch their stars ? Amitji, 

Sharmilaji, John (Abraham)? And they will get to see them in very different 

roles.

Your solo actor-director turn in Struggler 

has finally been cleared by the tribunal?

Yes, I am very happy about it. Struggler has 

no commercial trappings. I am all alone in the film. I am planning to release 

the film commercially but only in metros like Mumbai, Delhi, Calcutta and Pune. 

People there would be able to identify with the character. I am not demeaning 

the audiences of villages and small towns but they may not grasp the purpose of 

the film, which is about an actor struggling in the film industry and what he 

goes through during that phase.

Your other two films, Deh and Life Ho 

To Aisi, are also ready?

Deh (Jaya Prada, Dino Morea) belongs to the 

Sahara folks. It?s their baby, I was just the foster father. It?s more in the 

Astitva genre. As for Life Ho To Aisi (Shahid Kapur, Amrita Rao), 

it will be a Diwali release.

What next from Mahesh Manjrekar?

I am taking a break. I am really tired after the non-stop 

one-and-a-half-hour talking in Struggler. I?m just doing small roles as 

actor in some movies.

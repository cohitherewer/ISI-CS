 Grooming right for the crowning glory

 With less than a week to go for the final day of the Godrej Renew Sananda Tilottama contest, to be held on April 29, the 20 finalists of this year?s beauty pageant are busy 12 hours a day to try and be their best. Goodlife takes a closer look.

 Countdown:

 Starting at 8.30 every morning, the girls are going through training modules, meeting judges for sub-contests and attending photo-sessions till 8.30 pm. On April 23, they spent the day at Princeton Club on Prince Anwar Shah Road being judged on various physical and mental attributes ranging from Most Beautiful Eyes to the purpose of participating in the contest. Meeting three judges on a one-on-one basis, they engaged in an informal chat with each of them, even as the judges took down notes. The 14 days of grooming is beginning to show.

 Grooming: 

 The ugly duckling in the fairytale may have changed to a beautiful swan naturally, but the same doesn?t hold true for this set of aspiring beauty-crown winners, for most of whom this is the first brush with glamour. 

 ?All these girls come from different backgrounds and the first step is to make them unlearn all that they may have picked up about looking good and being smart. The grooming starts after that,? says Sanchita Kushari Bose of Dream Merchants, the event management group handling the event. 

 From the basics of body posture and communication, the girls are policed on every aspect of their actions. Even the few minutes of personal time they get in the 12 hours ? during a meal or while waiting for the next call of action ? their moves are monitored. Psychological toughening to ensure that they can take the pressure on D-Day is given extra importance. ?Yet sometimes they lose out on confidence and have to be encouraged to do better,? adds Sanchita.

 Assessment: 

 ?The best thing about new-age wannabe beauty queens is that they have a definite focus and aim in life. Looking good is not all that they are concerned about,? feels one of the judges involved with the contest from the early stages. While the grooming has made a world of difference to the way they carry themselves, some of them have actually evolved as people in the past two weeks. ?The best thing is that they are very conscious about what they are getting themselves into. While some want the easy route to fame, others already have very clear stands on the industry?s loopholes like the casting couch,? adds another judge. But the little red mark on the otherwise clean report card comes in the form of one little issue: ?At least 50 per cent of the contestants aren?t fluent in English. I think that will act as a deterrent if they want to take up bigger challenges beyond the regional limits.?

 On track:

 For the first time since its inception, the Tilottama night will have a theme musical track. Created by the fusion band Class Apart, consisting of Indian classical vocalist Pandit Santanu Bandopadhyay and rock musician Neel, the sound draws inspirations from Indian ragas while incorporating groovy beats in keeping with the young, vibrant and glamorous feel of the event. The group has also created a song called Don?t lose your way, which the contestants will ramp walk to on the final day of the contest. The lyrics have been penned by Neel, while both performers have lent their voices to the fusion number.

 On quote: 

 Amidst the long hours of slog, the only thing on the minds of the contestants now is to strive for crowning glory. ?I have to put in my best because if I don?t, the others will go ahead and win and I will be left behind,? stated one aspirant. The best thing about being in the Tilottama 2005 contest they agree is the chance to get to know themselves better ? strengths, weaknesses and all. ?I didn?t know what I was capable of till I got selected for the final contest and spent the two weeks here,? summed up one.

 Negligence whiff in baby death

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Lokman Hakim, the 11-month-old obese infant, who died after choking on food on Sunday, was fed more at one time than what was recommended by the medical board, the inquiry conducted by the SSKM Hospital authorities has revealed.

 ?The report points out the shortcomings of the paediatric department staff. Lokman should not have been fed a big bowl of semi-solid rice, which he was not used to at all,? said a senior health department official, hours after hospital superintendent Santanu Tripathi sent the report on the boy?s death to the department.

 Although, the inquiry report did not indict anybody in particular or hold anyone responsible for acting in a negligent manner, it has revealed that the medical board?s opinion of slowly introducing Hakim to a normal diet was not followed. ?I have noted whatever I had observed during the probe. Now, it is up to the health department to take a decision,? was all Tripathi would say.

 Later, health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra said his department was waiting for the police probe report to arrive, along with the post-mortem report, before taking any action.

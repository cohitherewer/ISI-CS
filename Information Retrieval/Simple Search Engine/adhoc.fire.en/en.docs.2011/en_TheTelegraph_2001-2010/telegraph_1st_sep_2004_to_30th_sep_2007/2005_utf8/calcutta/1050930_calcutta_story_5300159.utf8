The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Hell alive at airport 

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Passengers at Calcutta airport had a taste of hell on Thursday ? the toilets were filthy, lounges unclean, food and water was not available, and air-conditioners were turned off. 

 The 12-hour strike against the proposed privatisation of Mumbai and Delhi airports was ?largely successful?, as only two flights could be operated from the airport between 7 am and 7 pm.

 Giving the lie to what an Airports Authority of India (AAI) official would later say ? ?We were ready for full-fledged operations and our contingency plan was successful? ? strikers early on Thursday closed down restaurants, shut conveyor belts, switched off X-ray machines and aerobridges, and confined senior officers to a small room for daring to report for duty.

 Three officials, including an assistant manager, were assaulted for coming to work and trying to turn on the air-conditioners.

 The handful of passengers and employees present on the premises, who had managed to reach the airport on Wednesday night, had to buy bottled water, and not just to drink.

 Though most airlines cancelled flights at the last moment, Indian Airlines operated a flight each to Mumbai and Delhi. IC 401 arrived from Delhi with 40 passengers around 10.30 am and left at 11.01 am with 31 people on board. 

 A little later, IC 677 arrived from Mumbai with 52 passengers and left around 11.45 am with 22 passengers.

 ?As the airlines did not take a chance, we could not do anything,? said a senior officer looking after operations.

 ?The strike was a total success across the country. The Air Traffic Controllers? Guild and the AAI may have been ready with their plans, but we proved to everyone who was more powerful,? boasted M.K. Ghoshal, convener of the Joint Forum of airport employees who spearheaded the strike.

 A victim of this show of strength was 14-year-old Dipjoy Bhowmik, who had been in a city hospital for the past few weeks and was on his way back home in Agartala. 

 The strikers forced Dipjoy and his parents to leave their car and walk one-and-a-half km from the gate to the airport. 

 ?We told them my son could not walk as he was suffering from serious liver and kidney ailments, but none listened to us,? said Dipjoy?s father, Swapan Chandra. 

 After trudging to the airport a little after dawn, Dipjoy collapsed and threw up twice.

 ?We are waiting outside, as the lounge, without the air-conditioning, has turned into hell,? added Swapan, uncertain of what to do. 

 Ananda Dey, wife Rina and their 10-year-old son Arnab were among the other victims. They had to pay Rs 400 to a rickshaw-van to reach the airport from Howrah.

 ?I scanned the entire premises for food, but could not get any. I later bought a mineral-water bottle for my son,? said Ananda. 

 They were scheduled to take the same flight to Agartala as the Bhowmiks.

 Forum members were out in full strength since early in the morning and stopped officers from entering the airport. 

 The few who got in were asked to stay put in the airport manager?s room. 

 Joint Forum convener Ghosal alleged that Indian Airlines had violated flying norms by making their flights land without the fire brigade in operation.

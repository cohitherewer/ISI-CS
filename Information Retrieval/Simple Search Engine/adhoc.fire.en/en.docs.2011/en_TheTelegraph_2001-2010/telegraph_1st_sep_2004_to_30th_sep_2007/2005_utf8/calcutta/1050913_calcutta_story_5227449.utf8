The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 To reason why, to reason well

 We live in a free society, exercise complete freedom of thought and expression. At least, that?s what we think. But more often than not, it turns out that the education system, popular media and other sources have shown us only one side of the coin. To liberate young minds from such intellectual confinements, Calcutta International School (CIS), in collaboration with Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre, screened a series of documentaries on various social and political issues over three weeks for the students of O-Level (Classes IX-X) drama and A-Level (Classes XI-XII) literature, history and sociology. Each screening was followed by detailed discussion on the themes. Here?s how it taught us to be a little more open-minded and, most importantly, to reason why.

 Day 1: August 8

 The series kicks off with Anand Patwardhan?s Jang Aur Aman (War and Peace). The 136-minute-long documentary, shot over three years, moves seamlessly from one topic to another ? the Partition, Gandhi?s assasination, Kashmir, politics of religion, nuclear tests, effects of uranium radiation on local inhabitants, Hiroshima, Bofors, the Tehelka scandal and so on. The popular myth of the ?peaceful atom? comes crashing down.

 The Class IXs are in shock and awe. Views stream in from all quarters. Dibyendu, our ?defence analyst?, has plenty to talk about. No doubt we?re in for a slew of theories and counter-theories over the next few days.

 In a uranium sky, twilight descends on wings of steel; splashed in the sunset hue of my friend?s blood; perhaps... he called my god by a different name

 Day 2: August 11

 Lalit Vachani?s Boy in the Branch captures the activities at the headquarters of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangha (RSS) in Nagpur. Hey Ram: Genocide in the Land of Gandhi is an acclaimed documentary by Gopal Menon based on personal accounts of the 2002 riots in Gujarat.

 Moved by the graphic images and narrative of the hard-hitting second documentary, a few of the younger students break into sobs. The film affects me more than I expect. Haunting remembrances of a friend, whose family came down from Gujarat, force me to excuse myself right after the screening.

 And in a flickering room, childish lisps turn into fervent prayer to a forbidden god before the candle blows out... Death becomes an attitude

 Day 3: August 30

 The day begins with a 15-minute humourous German documentary, Black Rider, that deals with the issue of racism in post-War Europe. It is followed by Night and Fog, one of the most powerful films made on the Holocaust. Shot in the 1950s, its political message is a bit dated, but the lyrical narrative of new life springing up in the deserted concentration camp sites, interspersed with horrifying footage of the genocide, still manage to leave a blood-curdling impact.

 We soon engage in a very stimulating session trying to attribute in-depth meanings to the apparently ridiculous events shown in it. Night and Fog is, probably, the most deeply impacting film to date. 

 No poet?s impression for this, for my insides are numb and sick.

 Day 4 : September 1

 First comes Crossing the Lines: Kashmir, India, Pakistan, shot by Pervez Hoodbhoy and Zia Mian in Pakistan, giving us an insight into what reasonable people have to say on the other side of the LoC. Then, Shadows of Freedom by Sabina Kidwai, which pursues a parallel narrative of three generations of Muslim women in India, as the film-maker looks to unravel the mystery of the murder of Shafi Ahmed Kidwai, then governor of Simla in 1947.

 We are surprised by the amazingly similar points of view from across the border. The second documentary was preceded by an exercise given to us ? to write down the five stereotypes we attach with the term ?Muslim women?, and to promise that the film would change the perception. Post-viewing, stereotypes are somewhat unchanged. For though a very inspiring film, it is not about Indian Muslim women in general, but a very small, privileged section. We all agree this is the most ?conformist? documentary of the series.

 Screenings over, we are now, hopefully, a little more critical and a little more independent in thought.

Freshers? fiesta

 Bihaan 2005 at RCC Institute, the freshers? welcome organised in association with Unish Kuri on September 7, kicked off with a performance by Bangla band Lakkhichhara. The intricate pieces, coupled with some mellow numbers, left the audience screaming for more. Later in the day, student bands Bhaba Ghure, Omlette and Inferno took the stage with hits like Nishwa Korechho? and catchy melodies like Bicycle Chor. The concert finally settled into a rock-groove with the guitars taking centre stage.

 Tour talk

 About 100 students of Class XI (commerce and humanities streams) of Salt Lake School were taken on an excursion to Birlapur Arsenic Water Plant on August 20. The two science sections took the trip on the 23rd. We learned about how arsenic-contaminated river water is purified for drinking water. The officials at the plant took us on a guided tour through every step of the process. In the laboratory, we were shown how arsenic, bacteria and invisible waste contents in the water are detected. To understand the procedure better, we were handed out pamphlets with a lot of information. Post-lunch, a seminar and interactive session with the plant officials followed. The trip made us realise how much public money goes into providing us with drinking water, which we take for granted.

 Nobel lesson

 Students of Hem Sheela Model School, Durgapur, will get a rare opportunity of having a Nobel Laureate for a teacher for a week this December. Dr Johann Deisenhofer, Nobel prize-winner in Chemistry in 1988, had laid the foundation stone of the institution a decade ago and has been invited to mark its founder?s day celebrations on December 30. 

 Affiliated to CBSE, the school on a 24-acre campus has been recognised as the sister school of Drury University, USA. Students who score above 90 per cent in the AISSCE are, therefore, automatically eligible for admission into the varsity for undergraduate studies with a scholarship.

 Coming up...

 Conserving Calcutta?s Bio-diversity, an awareness programme for the youth, at St Paul?s Cathedral on September 14, 11.30 am onwards. Twenty-five schools will take part in the Just-a-minute competition and 15 colleges will take part in poster-making and slogan-writing contests.

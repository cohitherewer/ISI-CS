 Squatters along Rabindra Sarobar on Wednesday set up a blockade on the railway tracks at gate number 3, between Ballygunge and Lake Gardens stations, for nearly two hours, to protest the eviction drive that the court has ordered to be completed by November 30.

 ?We are not going to leave this place. Let there be bloodshed,? said Sudhir Kumar Bera, a resident of Gobindapur.

 Suspecting that firearms and explosives were being smuggled into Gobindapur railway colony, plainclothesmen have been deployed in the area to keep a vigil.

 Around 1.08 pm, the agitators squatted on the tracks and burnt an effigy of railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav, forcing a Naihati-Budge Budge local train to halt at gate number 3. The demonstration continued till 3 pm. Local MLA Sougata Roy, also present on the spot, said: ?We won?t allow the eviction, we will fight till the end.?

 Eastern Railway officials said services on the Ballygunge-Budge Budge section of Sealdah South division were disrupted due to the rail block. 

 Two pairs of Sealdah-Budge Budge locals were cancelled, while two Up trains and one Down train were delayed en route by almost two hours. Normal services were restored at 3 pm.

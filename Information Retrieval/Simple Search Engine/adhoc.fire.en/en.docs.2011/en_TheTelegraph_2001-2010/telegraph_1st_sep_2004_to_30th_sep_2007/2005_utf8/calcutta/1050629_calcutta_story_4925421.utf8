 Voices with a view: A strike at Presidency College to demand campus clean-up

 Biswajyoti Bagchi,

 Diamond Harbour Road

 The students have a democratic right to raise their voice against the improper functioning of their educational institutions. But everything should have a limit. If an agitation by students affects academic activities on campus and hampers the education of others, the authorities should take action against the protesters. However, the teachers and administrators should handle the situation with care. 

 Prasanta Kumar Ghosh, 

 Barasat

 Students are not fools. Why should they go on a war path, jeopardising their career, unless there is a genuine reason? The condition in most educational institutions in the state is dismal. The teachers are politically inclined and neglect the students. It is only right for the students to protest in such a situation.

 Diptimoy Ghosh, 

 Salt Lake

 If the students disrupt academic activities in their educational institutions, there is no alternative but to punish them. But the punishment should not be harsh and should not affect the future of the students. The majority of the students should not suffer due to the actions of a handful. Steps should be taken to keep political parties out of the campuses of academic institutions.

 Sudipa Dutta Chowdhury, 

 Dum Dum Park

 Whenever there is a student agitation in an educational institution, academic activities are disrupted and examinations postponed. This does not imply that student agitations are bad. If the majority feels that a protest is for a just cause, then the students participating in it should not be punished. In the eyes of the authorities, all student agitations are improper since they are against the decisions of the authorities. The right to punish students for taking part in agitations should not therefore lie with the institutions. Punishment rarely solves problems, but gives rise to discontent and anger. Efforts should be made to avoid punishment.

 B.N. Bose, 

 Dum Dum

 Education is the passport to a bright future. Agitations in academic institutions have ruined the lives of many students in West Bengal. No wonder, students from the state have disappeared from the list of successful candidates in all India examinations. Students from the south, who are generally the most successful in these examinations, hardly take to the war path. Disputes in educational institutions should ideally be settled amicably. Punishments generally vitiate the atmosphere on the campus. 

 Sourish Misra,

 Salt Lake 

 Students should not be allowed to take part in agitations if that affects their academic pursuits. However, their protests are often for genuine reasons. Initiative on the part of the authorities can solve most student problems, thus leaving them with no reason to opt for something as drastic as a protest movement.

 Arpita Chowdhury, 

 Dum Dum

 The students themselves suffer the most by taking part in agitations. Protests take a toll on the functioning of schools and colleges, and pollute the academic atmosphere. So students must be punished if they agitate on the campus. A monetary fine may be imposed for causing disturbances on the campus. Having said that, the manner in which the students of Jadavpur University were treated was inhuman. 

 Arunava Bose Chowdhury,

 Barrackpore

 It would be callous on the part of the authorities to choose the path of punishment instead of sorting out differences through discussion. Both parties should look forward to an amicable solution through open-minded negotiation. They should not become impatient even if a settlement takes considerable time. If the students are obstinate and violate the norms of an institution, they should be punished.

 Santosh Chakravarty,

 Unique Park

 The cause of an agitation must be found out before the students participating in it are punished. If the demand is justified, the authorities should sit with the students and try to sort out the matter through discussion and counselling. High-handedness should be avoided. The authorities should fight the temptation to punish students instead of leading them in the right direction. However, the entry of politics into the campus should not be condoned. The students, on their part, must avoid adopting a rigid stance. 

 Arnab Chakraborty,

 BM Saha Road

 Students normally do not start agitations within academic institutions, unless the teachers and administrative authorities leave them with no other option. An agitation more often than not affects not just educational activities but also the prestige of an institution. Punishment in such situations is counter-productive. Discussions are a better option.

 Dalim Kumar Datta,

 APC Road 

 Students, being stakeholders in the future of their academic institution and the country as a whole, have every right to agitate on campus to press for their demands. However, their agitation should not exceed a limit. The authorities, too, have a vital role to play. They should give the students a patient and sympathetic hearing.

 Abhishek Arya,

 Fern Road

 Don?t the students punish themselves by taking part in agitations? By creating a situation in which their academic activities are hampered, they deprive themselves of valuable time that could have been utilised for constructive purposes. I do not think students need to be punished any further. In the course of time, they would realise that peaceful protests are more fruitful.

 Rimli Datta,

 Salt Lake

 Campus agitation should not automatically lead to punishment of the students. Agitation at academic institutions is quite often justified. The ongoing agitation at Jadavpur University is an excellent example. Without such protests, the authorities of educational institutions would become autocratic. However, if students misuse their rights, they should be punished.

 Hemanta Kumar Dutta,

 Shibpur

 There is no doubt that indiscipline has reared its ugly head in educational institutions. Students responsible for inappropriate behaviour on campuses should be handled strictly. However, teachers and administrators, too, act in ways unbecoming of their position. Their rigidity often leads to students rising in revolt. Individual egos should not come into play in disputes between students and the authorities.

 Ashok Kumar Ghosh,

 CIT Road

 The students are the ?minority? in any dispute with the authorities and should be treated sympathetically. But under no circumstance should they be allowed to hamper their own education by taking part in agitations. The authorities must rise above all other considerations to ensure smooth functioning of an educational institution. 

 Joydeep Chatterjee,

 Shyambazar

 Students should be punished if their agitation affects academic activities on campus. However, if the agitation is for a valid purpose then it must be allowed to continue till justice prevails.

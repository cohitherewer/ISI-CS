The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Options out of beam bafflement 

Lodestar amp; albatross

 - Taken for a ride, held hostage, what might save the set for the viewer

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

The Calcutta consumer remains hostage to the cableman, the multi-system operator (MSO) and the broadcaster. Is there a way out?

SOLUTION SWITCHBOARD

Government role: A bark by cable watchdog Telecom 

Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has added bite to the Bengal government?s 

active role in resolving the cable conundrum.

 ?Trai has urged state governments to step in. After all, the consumer is our primary concern,? Arun Bhattacharya, principal secretary to the chief minister, had said after a meeting involving the government and all cable players, on October 15, 2004. That was the day when the government kicked off a census to determine the number of cable and satellite households and subsequently work on declaration and even tariff rates. January 31, 2005, was the deadline set for the cable census.

 ?We will ensure that there is transparency at all levels,? was Bhattacharya?s pledge. That, of course, is easier said than done in a sector as transparent as an iron curtain.

 According to government sources, an ?income-tax-like approach? is being adopted for the census, with operators being asked to voluntarily disclose their numbers. The declaration format has been finalised and the forms are in the process of being distributed through police stations.

 These will then be cross-checked using electricity and basic telephone connection numbers and other available data. ?Declaration can be brought to a certain level and a payment cycle put in place,? said an official working on the census.

 If industry response is anything to go by, this could be the one thing the confused consumer can count on. ?We have a lot of hope pinned on the structured government initiative,? said Sanjiv Goenka, vice-chairman, RPG Enterprises and head of the largest city MSO Indian Cable Net.

 Self-regulation: In January 2004, a city MSO undertook a move to make operators declare ?at least 40 per cent? of their subscriber base. The radical step failed to take off since a majority of operators, used to supernormal profits, was loath to take a pay-cut.

 Broadcasters, MSOs and operators met time and again to clear the chaos, but each time, the idea was fine but implementation faulty.

 For an industry where the player is both law and loophole, self-regulation could be a standard for service.

 CAS amp; DTH: Conditional Access System (CAS) was supposed to be the lodestar of the cable industry that turned albatross. Lack of planning by the BJP government that proposed it and opposition from broadcasters helped ensure the crash of CAS.

 Chennai, the only metro running CAS, is not the ideal test bed, given its regional content bias and pronounced disinterest in popular Hindi channels. But a properly-planned CAS can still provide choice.

 Direct to Home (DTH) is the other option, where the viewer can directly access channels through a mini dish antenna. Doordarshan and Zee Network currently provide the service that eliminates the cableman, with clear reception and add-ons like FM radio stations.

 But besides being expensive ? DD?s Direct Plus costs around Rs 3,500 while Zee?s Dish TV installation is around Rs 5,000 ? there are content issues, too. DD?s 33 channels are all free-to-air, while Dish TV?s 100-plus channels leave out the STAR and Sony bouquets.

To be concluded

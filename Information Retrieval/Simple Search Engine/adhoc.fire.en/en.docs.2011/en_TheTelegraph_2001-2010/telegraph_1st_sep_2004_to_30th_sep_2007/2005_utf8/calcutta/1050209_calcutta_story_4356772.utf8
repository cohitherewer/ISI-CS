The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 We Ask You Answer

 Crime and pen punishment

 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Today?s question: Should book thieves at the Book Fair be punished like common thieves? 

More responses will be published next week

Ahasan Jahir Molla,

 Maheshtala

A book thief is after wisdom. If wisdom be the goal 

of life, then is it fair to punish such a thief? Especially given how interested 

the government is in educating citizens. Can the authorities promote literacy 

on one hand and punish book thieves in the same manner as Dhananjay Chatterjee? 

If book theft is a crime, then Lord Krishna should be punished for stealing butter.

Sudipa Dutta Chowdhury,

 Dum Dum Park 

Book thieves are in no way like common thieves. It 

is their love for books which forces them to steal. Last year, I witnessed two 

such thieves being caught at the Book Fair. They were school students and were 

asked to write down why they were stealing books. After writing a few words, they 

were in tears. I think it was an effective punishment for them. They were embarrassed 

and realised their mistake.

Bindu Dungarwal,

Ganges Garden

By stealing books at the Book Fair, a person denies 

others the opportunity to go through the books. If the thief happens to steal 

books to sell them off, then he or she should be punished according to the law. 

But those who steal books because they are unable to afford them, should be let 

off with a warning, if it is found that they really need the books. 

Ajay Singh, 

 Howrah

Book thieves, whether they are professional thieves 

or amateurs in need of books, must be punished. But the degree of punishment should 

depend on the motive of the person.

Pradip Banerjee, 

 BT Road

Book thieves at the Book Fair should not be punished 

like common thieves. They do not need to be sent behind bars, as most of them 

are from respectable backgrounds. But they should be slapped with cash fines.

Atif Ayaz, 

 Serampore

Theft is theft, whether it is of books or of more 

costly things. And theft at a place like the Book Fair is really shameful. Those 

who are caught red-handed should be given exemplary punishment so that no one 

ever tries to steal books again.

Mehjibin Yunus, 

 Bright Street

In most cases, book thieves are not treated like common 

thieves, whether at the Book Fair or outside. But by letting them get away lightly, 

we encourage them to continue stealing books, which is extremely wrong. So, book 

thieves should be punished, at least to curb book theft 

P. Pramanik,

 Santoshpur Avenue

Thieves are thieves, whether they steal books or valuables. 

Theft of a book is a loss to someone. So if the thief is caught, there is no reason 

to treat him or her differently. Punishment might dissuade the thief from continuing 

to steal.

Bhupendra Nath Bose,

 Dum Dum Park 

Definitely. Someone might steal a book at the Book 

Fair out of need. But in doing so, he or she denies someone else, who is, perhaps, 

in greater need of the book, a chance to own it. Hence, stealing at the Book Fair 

is a serious offence. Book thieves should be punished more severely than common 

thieves.

Prasit Sen, 

 Hatiara

No, book thieves at the Book Fair should not be punished 

like common thieves. Those who steal books are often educated and extremely moral. 

They steal out of love for books. They should be given a chance to rectify themselves.

Sujoy Roy,

 Sodepur

According to the Indian Penal Code, there is no difference 

between book thieves and common thieves, so the former should not be exempted 

from punishment. They may not have the money to buy books, but that does not permit 

them to steal. If book thieves are allowed to go without punishment, the publishing 

industry will be destroyed. 

MD. Ayub,

 Bright Street

Thieves should be punished whether they steal utensils 

from a house or books from the Book Fair. Most of those who steal at the Book 

Fair are students. They do so for extra income and not for the love of books. 

The heads of their academic institutions should be informed of their activities, 

at the very least.

Seraj Alam, 

 Bansberia, Hooghly

Those who steal books at the Book Fair are not thieves 

in the general sense of the term, but avid readers whose pockets do not permit 

the purchase of books. They must not be treated as common thieves. Book thieves 

should instead be encouraged to buy and read books. 

Prahlad Agarwal,

 Majdia, Nadia

Yes. Since there are others who buy books by paying 

good money like they buy other commodities in the market, there is no reason why 

book thieves at the Book Fair should not be punished like common thieves. Besides, 

punishment would keep the so-called ?hobby-thieves? at bay.

Suvadip Goswami,

 Maheshtala

The Book Fair is a festival for book lovers. Some 

of them are not financially well off and have turned thieves to be able to read 

books. Common thieves, on the other hand, are not interested in books at all. 

Ajit Kumar Das,

 Naskar Para Road

There are fundamental differences between book thieves 

and thieves of other items. The prices of books are so high that poor bibliophiles 

are sometimes left with no option but to steal books in order to read them. I 

do not think that such book lovers should be clubbed with petty thieves.

Prem Pada Mallick,

 Kalindi

Stealing books is as grave an offence as stealing 

any thing else. Moreover, stealing books at a place like the Book Fair tarnishes 

the image of the city and the nation. Hence, book thieves at the Book Fair should 

be penalised severely so that they refrain from stealing in future.

Sandhya Banerjee,

 Salt Lake

Yes, book thieves at the Book Fair should be punished 

like common thieves. Many books are sold at the fair that are not easily available. 

Book lovers wait the entire year to buy such books from the fair. It is really 

unfair to let people, who deny them the pleasure, go unpunished.

Daffy,

 Raja Rammohan Roy Road

Book thieves at the Book Fair deserve harsher punishment 

than common thieves. Books are the products of creativity and creativity is not 

a wholesale commodity.

Pankaj Bhatia,

 Loudon Street

The stolen books should be seized and thieves should 

be allowed to leave the Book Fair. 

Surajit Gupta,

 Fakir Chand Mitra Street

Prevention is better than cure. Keeping this in mind, 

the organisers of the Book Fair should make arrangements so that no one is able 

to steal books. If anyone still tries to steal and gets caught, then he or she 

should be forced to purchase the books. In case the person does not have enough 

money, he or she should be handed over to police. 

Debyani Basu,

 Birati

The reason behind the theft of a book is more often 

than not the thirst for knowledge. It is this desire, coupled with lack of money, 

that makes otherwise respectable people risk humiliation and punishment to steal 

a book. But there are also people who steal books for money. Such people should 

be punished strictly.

A.K. Mitra,

 Puddapukur Road

Why not? A group of people take advantage of the common 

perception that those who cannot afford books, steal them. According to me, there 

is no place for thieves at the Book Fair. Otherwise the publishers will be forced 

to shut shop.

MD Tanweer,

 GVR Lane

A book thief should be treated like an indisciplined 

student. They need moral punishment.

Debashis Saha, 

 Anath Deb Lane

Whether it is money or books, theft reflects poor 

character. So, thieves of any kind must be punished in accordance with the law. 

Book thieves should be punished especially because there are many visitors who 

come only to steal books. This is an unhealthy trend.

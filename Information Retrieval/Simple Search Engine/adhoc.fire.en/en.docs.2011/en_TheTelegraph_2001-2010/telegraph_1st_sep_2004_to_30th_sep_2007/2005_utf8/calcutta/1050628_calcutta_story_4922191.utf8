 A killing for the cabbies

 The Citu-sponsored transport strike left thousands of travellers arriving in the city by train or flight stranded and at the mercy of drivers out to make a quick buck.

 Long-distance passengers who arrived at Howrah and Sealdah stations after 6 am found no transport to take them to their destinations. Hundreds of passengers were seen squatting on the floors with their luggage. Those travelling a short distance chose to walk or take a rickshaw or a cycle-van.

 Spying a killing amidst the chaos, some taxi and private car drivers were demanding astronomical fares to ply relatively short distances.

 Ambikesh Jain, a businessman based in Jaipur, arrived at Howrah on a business trip by Coromandel Express from Visakhapatnam, only to find himself stuck at the station. ?A driver asked me for Rs 200 to go to Burrabazar. The usual fare is Rs 35. I will walk it,? fumed Jain, stomping off in the rain.

 Taxi drivers were demanding Rs 1,000 ? more than the price of most train tickets ? to go to Tollygunge from Howrah, a distance that would at a stretch cost Rs 200. From Howrah to Park Street, the going rate was Rs 500, and from Sealdah to Nagerbazar, Rs 700.

 Two persons, said to be Citu activists, were arrested at Sealdah station when they beat up a taxi driver and smashed the windscreen of his vehicle.

 Jawed Shamim, deputy commissioner of police (eastern suburban division), said Sunil Gupta and Ashoke Singh beat up Prakash Mishra for picking up commuters at Sealdah station.

 At the airport, too, passengers were stuck. The car rental agency was running short of vehicles, with the pre-paid taxi service not functioning. ?We rotate 10 cars through the day but since the afternoon, we have fallen short,? said an official.

 From central points, private cars were demanding Rs 750 to Howrah station, Rs 300 to Salt Lake, Rs 450 to Sealdah station and Rs 600 and more to south Calcutta. 

 Some passengers reached the airport early in the morning to avoid trouble.

 Rajat Pal Singh, a Houston-based engineer, was scheduled to take a flight to Delhi on Monday on his way back to the US. He left his parents? home in Jamshedpur a day early. 

 ?I came to Calcutta yesterday and stayed at a hotel, as I didn?t know if I could catch the flight if I reached Howrah on Monday,? he said.

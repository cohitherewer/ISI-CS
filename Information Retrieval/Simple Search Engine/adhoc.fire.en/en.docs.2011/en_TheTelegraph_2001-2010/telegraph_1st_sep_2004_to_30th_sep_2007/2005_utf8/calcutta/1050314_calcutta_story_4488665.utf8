The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Quality of doctors under scanner

 - Health 

fair soul-search will mark pitch for investors 

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR 

 Are there enough young quality doctors in Calcutta and are they committed enough? Answers to this, and other important questions, will be sought at the largest health fair in the city, which gets underway on Friday.

 Buoyed by its success in convincing investors in the healthcare sector to come to Bengal, the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry, organisers of the Wellbeing Show 2005, is now set to kick-start private medical education in the state.

 ?There is a pressing need for good young doctors in Calcutta. Training of quality doctors will be an area of focus during the event,? said Amit Ghosh, chairman of the health sub-committee of the chamber.

 Prominent names in healthcare in the country, including Medical Council of India official Ved Prakash, director of medical education C.R. Maiti and a number of corporate bigwigs and dignitaries will take part in a brainstorming session at the fair to figure out ways to improve quality of doctors.

 ?We are not saying that the government-controlled medical education system in Bengal is faulty, but there is room for improvement. Professional private groups can pitch in with ideas and there are investors ready to pump in money,? Ghosh added.

 Of late, there has been a spurt in complaints of negligence against doctors in city hospitals. ?We have observed that a lack of communication and commitment on the part of the doctors resulted in almost 70 per cent of the complaints. We are investigating this,? a senior health department official said.

 The death of 17-year-old Rajnis Patel at SSKM Hospital stands out as the most-talked-about case of medical negligence in recent times, followed by the death of college student Sushmita Biswas, also at SSKM Hospital. 

 Several other cases, including the death of a 65-year-old cardiac patient at SSKM Hospital?s Mackenzie ward on Saturday evening, have also been in the news in recent times.

 ?We have enough doctors but the commitment level is abysmal. All a patient seeks is a little sympathy. It is great that the chamber will use the fair as a platform to impress upon everyone the need for quality doctors,? Subir Ganguly, an oncologist and past president of the Indian Medical Association, told Metro.

 Top city hospitals will offer their services free of cost during the three-day event at Oberoi Grand. Well-known doctors, like S.H. Advani, and specialists in asthma, eye-care and diabetes will also be available for free consultation.

 ?We hope that issues like privatisation of medical education, health insurance, emergency medicine and mental health problems will be properly addressed at the seminar,? signed off Ghosh.

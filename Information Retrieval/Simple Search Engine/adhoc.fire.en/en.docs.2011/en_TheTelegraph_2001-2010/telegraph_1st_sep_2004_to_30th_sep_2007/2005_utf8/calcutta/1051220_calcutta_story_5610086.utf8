Life

 Fun, food set floor on fire

 What: A performance by Rakhi Sawant.

 Where: Tantra, The Park.

 When: Saturday night.

 The show: Rakhi did what she does best ? sent the mercury a soaring and the party people a shouting. The Pardesiya girl gave her first performance half-an-hour after midnight. The songs included Honto pe aisi baat, Mohabbat hai mirchi and Deedar de. The second and last leg of Rakhi raunch followed after an hour, to tracks like Kajra re, Garam masala, Salaam namaste and Haadsa.

 Seductress speak: I do not mind being called an item girl. At least I have created a niche for myself. Moreover, just because I am an item girl, I get to do shows like these!

 Concert call

 What: My Favourite Things, an evening of intimate jazz and blues.

 Where: CC amp;FC.

 When: Saturday evening.

 The performers: Anjum Katyal and Isheeta Ganguly on vocals; Nondon Bagchi on the drums; Sumith Ramachandran on the guitar and Willie Walters on bass.

 The show: The evening began with Isheeta belting out Youre Too Good To Be True, followed by Fly Me To The Moon. Anjum then took over the mike and began with Unchain My Heart and Walking After Midnight. The audience count went up as the evening progressed.

 The mood: Beautiful weather and great music ?with such a winning combo, one really cant go wrong with the mood. The set-up, by the poolside, was stunning. Towering trees and hundreds of tiny bulbs lit up the club premises as the enthusiastic audience soaked up the soft ambience. A barbecue dinner served as the perfect finale to this winter evening.

 Big bite

 What: Bakery Carnival 2005, presented in association with The Telegraph.

 Where: Calcutta Club.

 When: Throughout Sunday.

 The food: Baking may have had very little to do with the bash, but no one seemed to mind being served loads of kebab and biryani. From Amber to Bawarchi to Bedouin to Shiraz, it was Mughlai munch mania all the way. The Taj cake shop La Patisserie, along with Flurys and the Kenilworth cake shop, was the saving grace as far as bakery items went. Here too, the whipped variety ? strawberry and chocolate mousse ? was the main attraction.

 The show: Throughout the day, the stage was bustling with some activity or the other. The antakshari and quiz shows were fine, but it was the fashion show, punctuated with dance performances, that really set the ball rolling for the evening. The designs were a mixed bag. Once Hip Pocket took over with Rila Banerji Brien lending her voice, the crowd took the cue and packed the dance floor.

 First show

 What: Premiere of King Kong. 

 Where: Fame (Hiland Park).

 When: Thursday evening.

 The turnout: While many big names from Tollywood were invited to catch the first glimpse of Peter Jacksons giant creation, the attendance was lukewarm. Former mayor Subrata Mukherjee turned up, as did writer Sunil Gangopadhyay. 

 On the glamour scales, model-turned-actress Sayantani Ghosh stole the show in a black number. She was certainly no Naomi Watts, but she did made a pretty picture posing in front of King Kongs cardboard cutout.

 Also on the invitee list were 20 underprivileged children from the NGO CINI Asha. Members of city bands Krosswindz, Cactus and Orient Express were seen entering the just-opened auditoriums, popcorn cans in hand. 

 Arindam Sil and his wife were the rare filmi twosome to stay back till the end of the three-hour movie, which finished almost at midnight.

 But for those who did last the distance, King Kong was quite an experience.

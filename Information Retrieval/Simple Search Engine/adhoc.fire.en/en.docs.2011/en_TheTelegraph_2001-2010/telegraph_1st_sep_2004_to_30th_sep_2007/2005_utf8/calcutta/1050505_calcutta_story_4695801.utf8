The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bose record-busting charge put on hold

 A still from Bose The Forgotten Hero: Delayed arrival

 Bose The Forgotten Hero will have to wait for a date with The Guinness Book of World Records. The premiere of the Rs 35-crore biopic is being pushed back by a week to May 13. But the Guinness record-breaking attempt is not happening on the same day. 

 A high-profile team, comprising the team?s key cast and crew members and representatives of producers Sahara One Motion Pictures, had announced in Calcutta that the film would attempt to create a world record on May 5, beating a 35-year-old mark registered by Robert Altman?s Brewster McCloud, which premiered at Houston, Texas, before a 23,930-strong audience.

 On being contacted in Mumbai, marketing head of Sahara One Motion Pictures Priti Shahani said the national and international premiere would take place simultaneously on May 13 but the ?scale and size? of the premiere would not be the same. 

 ?We are considering the world record attempt two weeks later.? She clarified that though it would not be a premiere, it would still qualify for a shot at the record as the attempt falls under the category of largest screening. ?The Guinness authorities have assured us of that in conversation but we are waiting for the documents,? she said. 

 One major consideration behind the postponement is kaal baisakhi. ?Our onground team has warned us that a thunderstorm has already taken place this season and we do not want to take the risk.? The record-busting attempt was to take place on the Eastern Command grounds. 

 The premiere plans are spread across three cities. The team first lands in Jaipur on May 10 where the chief minister of Rajasthan is supposed to attend the screening. Next up is Calcutta on May 11 at Inox. Delhi?s turn comes third on May 12. Mumbai will have a special screening on a day after the release.

 Shahani insists that the premiere will take place ?with as much enthusiasm? with a star-studded team of Shyam Benegal, Sachin Khedekar, Rajeshwari Sachdev, Rajit Kapur, Divya Dutta and Kulbhushan Kharbanda slated to come down with Bose.

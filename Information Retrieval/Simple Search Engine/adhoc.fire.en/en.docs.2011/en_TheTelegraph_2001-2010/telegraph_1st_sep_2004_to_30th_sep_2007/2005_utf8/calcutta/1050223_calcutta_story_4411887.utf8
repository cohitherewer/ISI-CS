 India?s the flavour in Southeast

 - Aggressive trip-courtship: fares in free fall, sightseeing made easy, shoppers? stops target tourists

 NISHA LAHIRI

 Fares in free-fall mode, living costs lower than ever before, sightseeing made easy, an Indian fashion flavour, shoppers? stops geared to Indian tastes ? Southeast Asia has never tried harder to make the Indian tourist feel wanted.

 If the airlines in and out of Calcutta are dropping ticket rates to counter over-capacity in the sky and attract custom, tourism boards are moving in with aggressive marketing to back it up.

 Thai Airways slashed fares a little over a week ago. This week, Singapore Airlines is following suit, with ticket prices to and from Southeast Asia in free-fall mode. But that?s just the tip of the airlines? offering. It has also introduced two nights? free stay in Singapore, with free admission to one attraction in the city, hotel transfers, discounts on food and shopping in Singapore for those returning from Australia, New Zealand and USA to Calcutta.

 Singapore Tourism Board has more in store. For the Singapore Fashion Festival in March, among the international designers and brands displaying their wares on the ramp will be Indian designers, led by Sabyasachi Mukherjee, JJ Vallaya and Wendell Rodricks. But the top draw is the shopping festival in May. Indians are the best customers, since over 80 per cent of them spend on shopping in Singapore, explains a spokesperson.

 ?According to spots like Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Dubai, which conduct regular surveys, Indians are among the top five spenders. In Singapore and Sri Lanka, Indians are already the top spenders,? says Kavi Ghei, director, TRAC, which represents the tourism boards of Korea, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Mauritius in India. Ghei identifies Calcutta as a key market for Southeast Asia, justifying the move to set up office here recently.

 Travel in February ? the ?lean period?, pre-summer ? on individual airlines has gone down in Calcutta. ?It?s because there are more airlines here now, and this is traditionally a low period,? says Bharath Mahadevan, manager, eastern India, Singapore Airlines. But even in about 10 days of slashed fares, numbers are slightly up at Thai Airways. ?Last Saturday, we had a full flight,? says S.C. Kapur, district sales manager, eastern India, Thai Airways.

 ?There has been a 20 per cent rise from last February in air bookings. But the customer base is the same, so the price war is all about wooing the same people,? says Ankur Bhatia, managing director, India, of global distribution system Amadeus.

 Plummeting prices, rising flight capacity and connectivity are making countries spend on roadshows, special schemes and marketing campaigns in India. Nepal is working on family tickets ? buy three get one free ?with free casino coupons worth up to Rs 2,500 per person thrown in free.

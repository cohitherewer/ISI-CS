 Healthcare battles bacteria havoc

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

Transient bacteria can be washed away with soap, but resident flora (bacteria 

present inside hair follicles) refuse to be washed away and are lethal

 Cross-infection causes pneumonia, respiratory 

infections, septicaemia and internal infections

 Infected medical equipment can cause viral 

infections and also hepatitis B and C 

 Washing of hands between patient visits, safety 

gowns and safe surgical procedures can cut down on infections 

Five days ago, cancer patient Animesh Chatterjee was hospitalised for a mandatory post-surgical check and chemotherapy ? a process that should have been over in hours. 

 Unfortunately, the 55-year-old picked up a nosocomial (hospital-acquired) infection, causing severe respiratory distress, which forced doctors to put him on a high dosage of antibiotics, worth Rs 3,500 per day, to save him from a lethal bout of pneumonia. 

 His cancer treatment has not started yet and the healthcare costs have spiralled tenfold for no fault of his. 

 What happened in Chatterjee?s case is happening to hundreds of Calcuttans, forcing healthcare planners in the private sector to rethink their strategy to counter bacterial infection on their premises. 

 ?It is difficult to believe, but hospital-acquired infection is said to be affecting almost 20 per cent of all hospital patients, primarily through cross-infection,? says surgical gastroenterologist Sanjay De Bakshi, who has been sounding the alert for years.

 Experts have identified the most common forms of bacteria ? staphylococcus aureus (causing septicaemia and skin infection), pneumococcus (causing pneumonia) e.coli (causing internal infection and septicaemia) and tetanus bacteria as the ones wreaking havoc in private hospitals.

 The bacteria evolve an elaborate and sophisticated defence system against drugs and also pass genetic information from one bacterium to another through cross-infection, which results in complexities. 

 Healthcare workers can spread infection among patients during visits to wards, mainly through touch. In other cases, lack of proper sterilisation causes infection from medical equipment as well, says experts.

 ?For years, endoscopes have been a major hurdle to infection-free health facilities. Disinfecting endoscopes does not necessarily mean reducing the risk of infection. So, we have decided on sterilisation,? says Mahesh Goenka, chief gastroenterologist at Apollo Gleneagles Hospital. 

 The hospital recently bought a low-temperature sterilisation system from US-based Steris Corporation to check the menace of infection. 

 ?After Apollo, at least seven more hospitals in the city have shown interest in our sterilisation products and it seems that hospitals have realised how important it is to cut down on nosocomial infection rates,? said Bishwaroop Ghosh, the country manager of the US-based company. 

 Perhaps with the idea in mind, Wockhardt Hospital recently initiated the move to form Calcutta?s first Hospital Infection Society. 

 ?Nosocomial infection is the most dreaded phenomena in any medical organisation. With proper monitoring, adaptation of correct operating procedures and continuous interaction, we should be able to check the menace to a great extent,? said Rupali Basu, general manager of the hospital. 

 The objective of the society is to educate nurses and doctors about hospital infections and on safety measures like regular hand-washing and wearing safety gloves while attending to patients. 

 ?Hospital infection spirals healthcare costs and a patient has to spend thousands of extra rupees for no fault of his. Therefore, infection control is a must now,? added cancer surgeon Gautam Mukhopadhyay.

 Lead lack in tutor murder

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Forty-eight hours after the murder of tutor Bimal Ghati in Salkia, Howrah, police are clueless about the identity of the killers. 

 According to the investigators, a bunch of questions has to be answered before the case can be solved. 

 On Monday, police had arrested brothers Tapan Dutta and Prasanta Dutta and Susanto Mondal in connection with the murder. 

 Tapan lives in the same building as Ghati, and claimed that he had bought the property. He had threatened Ghati to move out or face dire consequences. 

 All three were produced in the court of sub-divisional judicial magistrate (SDJM) on Tuesday.

 ?We have come to know of a few names in connection with the conspiracy. We are sure that they have killed Ghati on the instructions of the Dutta brothers,? said Howrah superintendent of police Mihir Kumar Bhattacharya. 

 ?All the members of the gang, who are still in the locality, will be tracked down within a few days,? he asserted.

 Howrah SDJM Raja Chatterjee ordered police custody for Tapan and Susanto Mondal for three days.

 Prasanta was sent to Howrah District Hospital for treatment after he complained of heart problems. 

 Inquiries have revealed that Ghati was not killed on his way to the house of the family advocate. Police said he was shot after being physically assaulted at a place some distance away from the neighbourhood.

 ?He was abducted from his house on Sunday night, after his younger brother Amal had left for their legal adviser?s residence,? said a police officer. 

 After he was killed, a group of people took the body to TL Jaiswal Hospital, where they furnished false names and addresses, police said.

 ?The names and addresses on the hospital register were found to be false by the sleuths on Tuesday, morning,? said a senior police officer. 

 After the addresses and the names turned out to be fake, police became certain that Ghati was not killed in the area, but at some other place.

 The people who had taken the body to the hospital concealed their identity to avoid police interrogation, the investigators said. 

 Ghati, a successful tutor in Howrah?s Golabari area, was shot allegedly over a property dispute.

 He was supposed to reach the house of the family?s legal adviser after his brother Amal. 

 When Bimal did not turn up, Amal lodged a missing diary with Golabari police station. 

 Ghati?s body, with several injury marks, was later found at TL Jaiswal Hospital.

 The Ghatis were having problems related to the house where they lived. The Dutta brothers had threatened to kill them if they did not vacate the house.

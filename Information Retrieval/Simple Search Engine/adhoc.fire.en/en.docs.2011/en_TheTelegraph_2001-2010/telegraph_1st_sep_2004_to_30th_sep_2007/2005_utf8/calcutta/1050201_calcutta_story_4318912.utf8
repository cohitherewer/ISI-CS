The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Now, park your car free

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 The civic authorities are set to overhaul the city?s parking lots, mayor Subrata Mukherjee announced on Monday.

 ?We would like to throw open the car-parking business, hitherto the monopoly of a handful of cooperatives. This will help the city earn more revenue and more citizens will be able to park their cars by paying fees or for free,? elaborated the mayor.

 At present, there are about 50 paid parking lots in the city, where approximately 4,000 cars can be parked. A dozen co-operatives have been running the lots or zones on lease for over 20 years. They pay about Rs 5 crore to the civic authorities for running the lots.

 Prompted by motorists? complaints of arm-twisting by the attendants at many of these lots, the civic authorities have also decided to put up large display boards at both types of parking zones. 

 The boards will carry details of the capacity and tariff of the lots, and telephone numbers of civic officials who can be contacted for redress of grievances.

 Some of the existing contractors behind the banner of cooperatives are allegedly out to foil the mayor?s plans. On the first day of issuing tender papers earlier this month, they had jammed the counters and bought up all the tender papers, civic officials claimed. 

 The mayor said he hoped to break the nexus between the leaseholders and a section of police and civic officials.

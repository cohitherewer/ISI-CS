 Backing creativity with commerce is the concept guiding the fashion industry the world over. Relatively new to the idea, Indian designers, too, are inching towards corporatisation of the fashion industry, slowly but surely.

 While individual designers are regularly attracting sponsors for their collections, a fashion conglomerate owning several fashion labels in the same model as Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH) doesnt seem to be a distant dream. The process has already begun.

 Genesis Colors, the parent-holding company of the premier design house Satya Paul, recently acquired the label Deepika Gehani, flagging off a brand new business model in Indian fashion. Sanjay Kapoor, managing director of Genesis Colors, spoke to Goodlife about his plans of building a fashion conglomerate.

 What exactly will be the role of Genesis Colors in supporting Deepika Gehani?

 The label is now completely owned by Genesis Colors and from now on it will be a joint venture between Deepika and us. She will only be involved with the creativity and designs, we will take care of the rest ? right from manufacturing and financing to distribution and retailing. As the holding company of the label, we will position and promote Deepikas designs to the regional and international consumer by opening standalone stores in all the major cities.

 So, do you have plans of building an LVMH-like fashion conglomerate?

 Thats exactly what we are looking at. We would like to acquire different labels and build a corporate structure modelled on a time-tested international business formula. Internationally, creativity, cuts and colours are just one part of the fashion business. Manufacturing, retailing, distribution and management are just as integral to the entire process.

 Do you think Indian designers are ready for such a model?

 They are opening up to the idea and I think its high time they realise this for the Indian fashion industry to grow. Designers are a creative lot; if they have to concentrate on the business aspect, creativity goes for a six. It will not be possible for them to expand and grow if they dont have a corporate structure. In this day and age, you either grow or perish. With the onslaught of malls and foreign brands, if the designers dont streamline their business, they will not be able to keep up with the competition and hence lose market share.

 Being part of a larger fashion company would mean that designers have to stick to certain guidelines set by you. Do you think Indian designers will agree to do that?

 We will be giving full creative freedom to the designers, there will be no interference from our side regarding that. But its true, we will have certain say regarding the price points. But here again, a designer has to understand the benefits of economy of scale that we will offer. Our manufacturing costs would be much less than that of standalone designers simply because we will be doing it on a larger scale. For instance, the fabric a designer will buy for Rs 40, we will procure for Rs 25 since we are buying in bulk. Hence, the designers cost price will go down majorly, so he or she shouldnt have problems in scaling down prices. 

 What things are you looking at while acquiring a label?

 We essentially look for a USP thats lacking in the market. For instance, Deepika has a flair for street fashion that not too many designers work on. Apart from that, we look at the creative quality and the niche market he or she caters to. We are also looking for variety. For instance, Deepikas work is totally different from Satya Paul. Her over-the-top, fitted, glamourous, girlie look is her USP and thats why we chose her.

 What are the other labels you are looking at right now?

 We have just acquired a New York-based label called Sanjana John. That apart, we are looking at two more brands right now, but I cant divulge the details till the deals are through.

 Are you concentrating on garments only, or do you want to expand to other lifestyle products as well?

 We are looking at everything in the lifestyle space ? from garments to accessories to maybe even home d?cor.

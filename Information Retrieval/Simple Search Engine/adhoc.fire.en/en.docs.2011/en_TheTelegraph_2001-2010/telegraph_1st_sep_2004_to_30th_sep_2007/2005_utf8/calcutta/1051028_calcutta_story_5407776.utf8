The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Twin bonanza, retail treats

 - Plex-plus-hotel in south Calcutta, food court in south-west

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 A multiplex and more in south Calcutta, a food court and more in south-west Calcutta ? it turned out to be a day of double delight for the city?s hospitality and F amp;B trade.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee chose an Indian Chamber of Commerce platform on Thursday evening to unveil RPG group plans for a shopping mall-cum-multiplex-cum-hotel/service apartments.

 ?We have three acres of land diagonally opposite Modern High School, which we will develop. The retail component will be anchored by a hypermarket, with a departmental store thrown in,? said Sanjiv Goenka, vice-chairman, RPG Enterpises.

 The multiplex, added Goenka, will be a five-screen one, while the rest of the space will be taken up either by a hotel or by service apartments.

 To be set up as a joint venture with Adi Godrej, chairman of Godrej Industries, the Rs 200-crore project will cover 400,000 sq ft, of which 280,000 sq ft will be retail space. The Goenkas will have a 60 per cent stake, with Godrej picking up the rest.

 Also on the retail front, the chief minister said the government was still treading carefully on Wal-Mart?s entry proposal in the food market. ?I am not clear whether their entry will benefit the local vegetable-sellers,? he said.

 But Bhattacharjee seemed bullish on Metro, the retail giant from Germany. ?They are coming for talks. They will buy vegetables and fruits and sell them to hotels.?

 Earlier in the day, Calcutta Port Trust announced that a tender would be floated to offer a one-acre plot in the Taratala area for a food court and allied infrastructure. 

 Chairman Anup K. Chanda told Metro that the Mainland China group, among others, had evinced interest in the project.

 Biswadip Gupta, managing director of Vesuvius Industries and one of the architects of the Taratala Initiative launched by Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said: ?An integrated food-and-retail facility will be hugely welcome in the area where nearly 35,000 people work.?

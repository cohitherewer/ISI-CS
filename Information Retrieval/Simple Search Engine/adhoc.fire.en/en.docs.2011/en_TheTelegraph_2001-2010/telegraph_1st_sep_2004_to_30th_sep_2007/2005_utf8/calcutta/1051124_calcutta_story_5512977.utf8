The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Music that?s different yet perfect

 They have played in memory of the 9/11 victims in New York, performed in various churches across Germany and elsewhere in Europe. Nonetheless, the ?friendly, eager faces? at St Paul?s Cathedral on Tuesday evening made members of the Leipziger Barocksolisten ?nervous? at the outset.

 ?We were a trifle tense to begin with, purely from a compulsion to live up to the expectations writ large on those intense countenances. Of course, their inherent warmth soon put us at ease,? Stefan Arzberger, violinist in the German ensemble, told Metro after the novel Baroque concert in town, presented by Max Mueller Bhavan in collaboration with Calcutta School of Music.

 The group of soloists, founded in 2000 over a casual round of beer in a Leipzig tavern, had set out to explore chamber music ?in its variety? and nurture it at the highest level. 

 The packed cathedral hall was treated to the distinctive feature of Baroque music ? the possibility of scoring ?ad libitum?, or improvising within certain parameters.

 ?Yes, we have the latitude to deviate from the norm in our interpretation of a composition and add a layer or two of self-expression, but the essence is in being authentic, play rhythmically and in tune,? Arzberger stressed.

 The group?s focus is a colourful and motley programme structure, made possible by constant additions to the repertoire. 

 Says bassoonist Thomas Reinhardt: ?Apart from the dependence of available musicians or instruments, a mixed instrumentation with string and wind instruments was always more interesting. The tonal colours are more varied, brighter and livelier.?

 Peter Wettermann (trumpet), Thomas Hipper (oboe), Tobias Martin (double bass) and Johanna Dorothea Franke (harpsichord) completed the sextet now touring the subcontinent. The soloists proceeded to Mumbai and Chennai and then to Colombo.

 The term ?Baroque? was applied to all European art forms in the 17th and early 18th centuries and the Leipziger Barocksolisten are at liberty to play certain works with ?unusual scoring?, the concerto and the sonata being the focal point of their concert programme. 

 On Tuesday, these wonderfully-gifted soloists from Leipzig showcased their remarkable range in rhythm and effortless control over their respective instruments ? wind or string ? that had the rapt audience in raptures.

 From the vigorous opening of Corelli?s Sonata in D and Fasch?s Sonata in G minor to the delightful trumpet-bassoon-double bass medley in Pezel?s Bicinium 75 and the violin-double bass collaboration in Bach?s Sonata in G, BWV 1021, it was a full-bodied performance of rare perfection.

 ?It?s obviously tempting to add your own interpretation to a piece, but as Baroque musicians, we are more like workers, and our first instinct is to perfect the rendition and play cohesively as a unit, no matter how diversely we think offstage,? Arzberger summed up.

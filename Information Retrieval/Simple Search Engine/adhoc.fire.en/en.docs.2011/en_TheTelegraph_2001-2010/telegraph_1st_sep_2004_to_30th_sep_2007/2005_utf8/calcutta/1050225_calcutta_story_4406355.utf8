 Hospital thrust on mother, childcare

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 Mother-child healthcare is the latest thrust area in the hospital business, with a slew of city clinics drawing up plans to invest crores in it.

 Inspired by the success of Bhagirathi Neotia Woman and Child Care Centre, speciality centres like Wockhardt Hospital and Kidney Institute, Ruby General Hospital, Belle Vue and AMRI Hospitals are ready for the foray into the lucrative segment.

 ?Neonatal care in the city is very fragile. Newborns reach our hands with several problems. Premature births, breathing disorders and birth asphyxia are some of the major problems that need to be addressed. No wonder, several hospitals have decided to start dedicated mother-child units,? said Chandan Ray, consultant paediatrician at Bhagirathi Neotia.

 Women?s health, too, is a cause of concern. According to gynaecologist Ratnavali Chakraborty, the problems troubling women include heart ailments, obesity and pregnancy complications.

 Leading the foray into the mother-child segment is Ruby Hospital, which is pumping in Rs 60 crore for a speciality unit on a 3.5 lakh-sq-ft plot on the Bypass. 

 The 250-bed hospital, likely to be ready by end-2006, will have separate wings for women?s health and paediatrics, including orthopaedics, neurology, surgery and neonatology. 

 ?The hospital will have all facilities for the mother-child healthcare,? said Sajal Dutta, managing director of the hospital and president of the Association of Hospitals of Eastern India.

 The hospitals in the expansion mode have conducted detailed surveys, which have revealed a huge gap between the demand for quality healthcare for women and children and the supply. 

 ?With the city catering to patients from all over eastern India, and some neighbouring countries as well, a Rs 1,000-crore market is waiting to be tapped,? said Dutta.

 That is exactly what the private hospitals have in mind. ?We will devote a sprawling campus for women-child healthcare at our new building, adjacent to the existing one. We will have the best available facilities in the field of neonatology and gynaecology,? said P. Tandon of Belle Vue. The hospital will initially invest Rs 2 crore in the project.

 Wockhardt Hospital will spend Rs 6-7 crore for setting up a mother-child unit on a 20,000-sq-ft area and AMRI Hospitals have set aside Rs 11 crore for the purpose. 

 ?Our hospital will come up on a two-acre plot on the Bypass and will have all the ingredients of success,? said Rupali Basu, general manager of the AMRI Hospitals.

 Not sitting quiet is Bhagirathi Neotia Woman and Child Care Centre, which has recently increased the number of beds in the babycare unit. ?We have plans to open a paediatric pulmonology clinic and expand in the women-care sector in a big way by mid-2005,? said a spokesperson.

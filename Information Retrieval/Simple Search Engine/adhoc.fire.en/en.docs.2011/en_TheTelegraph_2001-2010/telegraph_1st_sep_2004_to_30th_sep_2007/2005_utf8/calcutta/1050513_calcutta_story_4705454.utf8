 Aftab rant in security recast

 KINSUK BASU

 ?Jail se nikalne do, tumhara sir kha jaoonga? Tumhare CM ko bhi nahin chhorunga??

 Aftab Ansari?s recent rantings at Presidency jail ? currently he is lodged at Alipore Central jail ? had sent the government into a tizzy. And as a fallout, the entire security apparatus around chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s Palm Avenue residence and the CPM headquarters on Alimuddin Street has been recast.

 To pre-empt any retaliation by the Ansari?s men ? the gangster has been handed a death sentence in the American Center attack case ? commandos armed with latest INSAS rifles will be deployed at both venues.

 Eight commandos from the special action force will guard Bhattacharjee?s residence round-the-clock, along with an inspector from the special branch and two sub-inspectors from the local Karaya police station. The contingent will be in addition to the special branch and special security unit personnel, already deployed to guard the residence. 

 While the new arrangement is already in place at the Palm Avenue address, final touches are being given to the beef-up for Alimuddin Street.

 Senior officers are not willing to divulge the details. ?The matter is very sensitive,? said deputy commissioner (central) Ajay Kumar. On Wednesday, he had held a meeting to finalise the deployment around the party headquarters.

 Sources said four commandos and an inspector would join the team, comprising men from the armed police and Taltala thana, to keep vigil on the building. Their brief: scan all outsiders arriving at the party office and react sharply if anything is amiss.

 Besides Bhattacharjee, the high-profile politicians who regularly turn up at the party office include Jyoti Basu and Tripura chief minister Manik Sarkar. 

 The officers on duty have been provided with a separate telephone connection and manpacs, so in case of an emergency they will not have to fall back on EPBX to get in touch with the control room.

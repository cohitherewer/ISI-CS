The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 During a recent visit to Chatterjee International, I was really impressed by 

the ongoing renovation work both on its exterior and the inside. Once over, it 

might vastly improve the skyline and change the look of the area. However, when 

I looked out of a window on the 11th floor, I was shocked to see labourers perched 

on the iron supports that have been erected without any safety harness. They were 

oblivious of the danger of a possible fall which would inevitably kill them on 

the spot. I feel the contractors should take responsibility and ensure that safety 

measures are taken for all the labourers.

 Nisheeth Bijawat, Park Street. 

 It is high time we learn a lesson from the incident at Satara where hundreds 

of people died in a stampede. The scene at the Tarakeshwar temple of Hooghly, 

during the Bengali almanac months of Baishakha (April-May) and Shravana (July-August), 

is not very different from that of Satara on Paush Purnima. Narrow roads, slippery 

with water, the uncontrolled rush of impatient visitors, improvised electrical 

wiring with bundles of open wires hanging overhead ? all are perfect recipes for 

a disaster. 

 Tapan Pal, Batanagar. 

 Elliot Park, a joint venture of the Calcutta Police and Tata, is a welcome 

relief in the midst of the crowded Park Street area. The disappointing part is 

that the park closes at 5 pm. Moreover, parking area in front of the park is also 

reserved for Tata cars only. Can the authorities keep the park open till 7.30 

pm? And also, allow visitors to park their cars nearby? 

 Rakesh Bhatia, Loudon Street. 

 Recently, I had the opportunity of meeting Mithu Das, one of the award winners 

at The Telegraph School Awards for Excellence this year. He is a cobbler, 

struggling to provide a good education to his sons. He, however, politely refused 

to accept the financial help that I offered. He said he had the award money as 

of now and would contact me if he found it difficult to buy books and stationery 

for his children in the next academic session. It is nice to know that in the 

present day of opportunism, there still are people who believe in upholding their 

integrity even when faced with challenging situations. 

 Rabindranath Kar, Sankar Ghosh Lane. 

 The only post office which caters to a population of about one lakh from Behala 

Chowrasta to Shibrampur is Bakultala post office. The authorities should examine 

the feasibility of another post office in the fast-developing area. 

 Chandan Ray, Sakuntala Park.

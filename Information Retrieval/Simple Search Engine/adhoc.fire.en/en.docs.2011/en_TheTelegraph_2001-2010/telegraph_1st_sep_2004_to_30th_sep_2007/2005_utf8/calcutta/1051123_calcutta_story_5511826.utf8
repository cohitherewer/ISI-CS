The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Six days and nine plays

 The city can look forward to a feast of fine theatre as the Habib Tanvirs and Ratan Thiyams respond to a cause, reports Sebanti Sarkar

 Rangakarmee stages Kashinama

 A week after the ODI drama at Eden Gardens is done, Calcutta will stage a splendid six days of theatre. Starting December 3, a national multilingual drama festival will open at four auditoriums and one open-air venue in town. The fund-raising scheme by NGO Panchali will find the likes of Habib Tanvir?s Naya Theatre, Ratan Thiyam?s Chorus Repertory Theatre, Mala Hashmi?s Jana Natya Manch bringing in some of their best productions. From the Calcutta theatre circuit, they will be joined by Usha Ganguli and Badal Sircar. Making its debut in the city will be Abhinaya, a group from Kerala.

 ?We want to provide a unique opportunity for the Calcutta theatregoer and also make it accessible to the common man,? said Krishna Ray of Panchali, which is generating funds to support a project of transcribing the Rabindra Rachanabali into Braille. So, the ticket prices will range from Rs 20 to Rs 150.

 Day One will showcase Rangakarmee?s Kashinama at Madhusudan Mancha at 6.30 pm, which will also be staged on December 6 at Rabindra Sadan and at Girish Mancha the evening after. The play holds the mirror to a time when politicians have transformed religion into a savage fanaticism and culture has taken the back seat. The other Rangakarmee entry is Maiyat (December 5, Nandan complex, 4.30 pm).

 From Habib Tanvir?s repertoire, the festival features Ponga Pandit ? to be staged at the Nandan complex on December 6 ? that had drawn flak for its satirical view of rituals and religion. Alongside, there is the much acclaimed Charandas Chor. Those who haven?t seen it already should make it a point to catch it at Madhusudan Mancha (December 4), EZCC (December 5) or Academy of Fine Arts (December 8).

 On December 4, Badal Sircar?s adaptation of Rabindranath Tagore?s Raktakarabi can be seen at Nandan. Sircar?s Pathasena is a group doing serious street theatre just as Delhi-based Jana Natya Manch. The Mala Hashmi-led troupe is scheduled to present a play on women?s issues on December 7 at 4.30 pm, Nandan.

 Jostling with the plays in Bengali, Hindi and Chhattisgarhi is Ratan Thiyam?s Manipuri production Nine Hills, One Valley. Thiyam has always attracted attention for his unique form, ethnic choreography, music and props. This play gives a new perspective on recent events in Manipur.

Abhinaya, the 12-year-old group from Kerala, is staging an adaptation of Hermann Hesse?s Siddhartha (EZCC, December 4, Rabindra Sadan, December 5, and Madhusudan Mancha, December 6).

 ?This is going to be a stylised play with music and choreography,? Bandhu Prasad of Abhinaya told Metro from Kerala. The group intends to hand out a printed synopsis for those who can?t follow Malayalam.

 But then what barriers has theatre not vaulted? Take Calcutta?s Blind Opera, all set to present Tagore?s Raja in the original at Madhusudan Mancha (December 4, 10 am) and Girish Manch (December 5, 6.30 pm).

 An interactive panel discussion will be the added attraction on December 4. With Habib Tanvir and eminent theatre personalities from the city, the talk show will be moderated by Samik Bandopadhyay. 

 ?On each day of the function we intend to felicitate people from various fields like the visual arts, theatre, literature ? the likes of Mahasveta Devi and Jogen Chowdhury,? said Ray of Panchali.

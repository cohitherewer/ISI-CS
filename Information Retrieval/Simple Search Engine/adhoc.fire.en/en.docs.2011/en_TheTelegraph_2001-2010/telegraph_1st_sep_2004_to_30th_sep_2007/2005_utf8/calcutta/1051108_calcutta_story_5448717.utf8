 Depression drives constable to suicide

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A 55-year-old constable of the state police hanged himself inside the residential complex of the South 24-Parganas superintendent of police on Belvedere Road late on Sunday.

 Colleagues found Jeebanlal Roy hanging from the ceiling of the toilet in his quarters with a nylon rope tied around his neck. He was taken to SSKM Hospital, where doctors pronounced him dead.

 Roy?s relatives have confirmed to the police that he was a psychiatric patient and had been under treatment for the past few years. One of the relatives said Roy was afraid of loneliness and doctors had advised them not to leave him unattended.

 When asked how a psychiatric patient was allowed to report for duty and carry a rifle, a senior officer said: ?We had no information about the ailment. We have come to know about it only after talking to Roy?s relatives.?

 Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), said no suicide note was found in Roy?s room. ?It appears that Roy, who was posted at the police superintendent?s Alipore office, was suffering from depression. That might have led to the suicide,? he stated. 

 ?Investigation has revealed that Roy had attempted suicide three times in the recent past at his Cooch Behar residence,? Sharma added.

 Around 10.30 pm on Sunday, one of Roy?s colleagues found that the toilet door was bolted from inside. 

 When repeated knocks on the door yielded no response, they broke it open, only to find Roy hanging from an iron beam in the ceiling.

 ?He used to work as a guard at the superintendent?s office. On Sunday, he reported for duty as usual and left office like all other days,? said an official of Alipore police station.

 Mystery death: Police retrieved the body of a 52-year-old man from a drain in the Malipanchghara police station area, in Howrah, on Monday morning.

 Residents of the area reported to the police that a ?well-built man? was lying dead, face down, in the drain along GT Road. The body has been sent for post-mortem.

 ?There were no external injury marks on the body,? said Kalyan Banerjee, additional superintendent of police (town), Howrah. However, a few loose ends have prompted police to launch a full-fledged investigation into the case, said an officer.

 A receipt against a subscription to a madarsa found on the body has the name Manjur Khurshid and a telephone number of Vaishali, in Bihar, scribbled on it. Police suspect the scribble could reveal the man?s identity.

 The man lived in Tikiapara, but his body was found in Malipanchghara, nearly eight km away, where Khurshid had no acquaintances.

 ?There was mud and slush in his nasal cavity, windpipe, lungs. If he fell into the drain in a drunken state, how could slush enter his lungs?? asked an investigating officer. 

 ?It would have been possible only if someone had thrust his face under the drainwater. We strongly suspect that it might be a case of murder,? he signed off.

 Summer fun with mangoes

 Eating 43 Langras in one day had no untoward side-effects. Musician and foodie Nondon Bagchi lives to tell the tale

 Tongue Twister 

 A girl inspects mangoes at an exhibition

My great-grandmother (my mothers maternal grandmother), Kumari Kumudini Ghosh, married Shri Sriranga Behari Lal, a zamindar of Bishanpur, in North Bihar. They were a devout and religious family and in course of time, their lives revolved increasingly around their faith and the reins of administration were taken up by my great grandmother, pint-sized tigress that she was. 

 This was Kipling country, not far from the Terai and mother often regaled us with stories about cobras and kraits, of tourniquets and incisions and nocturnal visits to the doctor. Many of these tales spoke of the courage and resourcefulness of Kumudini.

 But in 1966 when my great grandmother was 90-plus and still going strong, mother decided that one visit ? perhaps the last ? must be made to Bishanpur. The idea caught everyones imagination and nine of us boarded the train at Howrah. Mother and her parents, her sister and brother-in-law, my cousin, my two sisters and myself. 

 It was the height of summer and first stop was Muzaffarpur where a grand-uncle had a palatial place and where we were thoroughly spoilt for two days with some of the worlds best lychees and mangoes, before moving onward to Samastipur. 

 From here to Sitamarhi by narrow-gauge railway and from Sitamarhi to Bishanpur by bullock-carts.

 What a holiday! It was like being Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. Swimming in cool, clear waters, fishing, bathing in the cold water drawn from an ancient well shaded by the boughs of an immense Banyan tree, riding bareback on long-horned buffalo, running wild in wide open spaces and eating and eating. 

 Mangoes mainly. There was an entire orchard full of them. There were local varieties like Mithua (the finest sweet mangoes I have had ? succulent flesh with no hint of fibrousness) and Matkupia and of course the large Maldoi (not Benarasi) Langras. One day I had 43 mangoes. And nothing untoward happened. 

 God created mangoes with his own hands. He did not trust Viswakarma with the task, is the theory of my friend Subrata Bakshi whom I call Major, although he has never been a military man. Appreciating mangoes is a fine art, just like tasting good wine, he says. 

 From the moment you hold the fruit in your hand and regard its colour, the pleasure begins. Then you smell the aroma where the stalk was, and then you scrape this area and smell it again. A different, fuller, richer aroma, a blend of youth and ripeness, emanates.

 He pauses. Then you peel it slowly. If the flesh sticks to the skin, scrape it with your teeth, at which point you might experience the slight bitterness of tannin (especially with Langras), but this will merely enhance the pleasure to follow. When the mango has been peeled, just physically holding it is something to enjoy. Again, one must stop to take in the colour and now the aroma, lush and heady, permeates everywhere. 

 When you finally take a bite, keep the flesh in your mouth for as long as possible, chewing slowly or pressing the flesh against the palate to enjoy fully the taste and flavour, before swallowing.

 Major will go on to expound on the various ways of eating different varieties of mangoes. If a mango is fibrous, he will recommend that you suck the juice and the pulp, instead of biting into it. 

 He remembers the days when the mango season would be ushered in by hawkers calling out Gulab Khas of Tollygunge! Today this is non-existent. Development has ensured that not a single Gulab Khas tree remains there. 

 This now comes from Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. From Malda and Murshidabad to Bihar and UP and what grows where and how the classic Bombai mango has much character because it is full of surprises, his knowledge is vast. He holds your interest for a long time. 

 Of course he is against any implements when eating mangoes and still stands over the kitchen sink and gets hell from his wife when the juice trickles down his elbows on to the floor. 

 Possibly the best solution for this was found by a young lady from Holland who came to Calcutta and put up at the Oberoi Grand. On being presented with a dozen Langras, she got excited, took off her clothes, stepped into the bathtub, ate her mangoes to hearts content, had a shower and emerged, radiant.

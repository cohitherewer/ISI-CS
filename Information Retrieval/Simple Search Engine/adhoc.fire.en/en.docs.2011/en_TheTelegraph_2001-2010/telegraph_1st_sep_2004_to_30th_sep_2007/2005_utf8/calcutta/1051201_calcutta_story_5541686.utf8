 Cover theft ?organised? 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta?s civic authorities on Wednesday admitted that organised criminals were to blame for the alarming rate at which manhole covers were disappearing from different parts of the city. Covers worth Rs 3 crore disappear every year.

 ?We may not be far off the mark if we say about 20,000 of the 100,000-plus manholes are death traps because they are without covers,? said Swapan Dutta Gupta, chief engineer, sewerage, Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC). 

 ?Hardly a month passes when I have not got direct complaints of at least 250 missing manhole covers, in addition to the large number of complaints from each of the 15 boroughs. Many such thefts go unreported,? he added.

 Calcutta?s relatively depressed eastern part, comprising neighbourhoods like Kasba, Topsia, Tiljala and Tangra, records large-scale thefts. 

 According to police, one of the common crimes logged by Tiljala police station relates to thefts of manhole covers. ?I myself filed nearly 200 complaints of manhole cover thefts with police in the past month-and-a-half,? said Javed Mohammed Khan, leader of the opposition Trinamul Congress in the CMC. 

 Following the shocking accident on the Maidan on Wednesday, municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay discussed the problem with commissioner of police Prasun Mukherjee.

 ?I suggested that police beef up night vigil to stop the thefts,? said Bandyopadhyay.

 It was also decided that police will conduct raids on scrap iron stores at Ultadanga, Raja Subodh Mullick Square, Mullickbazar, Maniktala and in the Beleghata area. Some of these stores buy stolen manhole covers, said civic chief engineer Dutta Gupta.

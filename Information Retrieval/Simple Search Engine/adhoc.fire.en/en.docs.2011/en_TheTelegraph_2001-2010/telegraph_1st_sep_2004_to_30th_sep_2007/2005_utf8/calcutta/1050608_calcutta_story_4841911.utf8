The immigrant experience

 Cannes is a marketplace. The red carpet is there just to attract attention to certain films. So there is no negativeness about the fact that India did not have a single film in the participative category of the festival,? UTV Motion Pictures boss Ronnie Screwvala states matter-of-factly. 

 UTV took three films to Cannes ? Blue Umbrella, Rang De Basanti and Viruddh. ?None fitted the competitive category. So it didn?t make sense for us to enter the competition,? he shrugs. ?More goes on at the festival outside that circuit.?

 The European festivals, according to Screwvala, are opening up to marketing activities. ?The American Film Market has always been more active. Last year we did a deal with Miramax International there.? The result is a cluster of Miramax films being distributed in India by UTV, like the Bruce Willis-starrer Sin City knocking at release door.

 The importance of Indians being showcased at Cannes is manifold. ?Faces like Aishwarya Rai become pictures that people carry back as their impression of our films and our country. This helps to market not just our productions but also tourism and other service industries.? 

 The global market, he points out, is growing at a never-before pace. ?The market abroad is just as big as the domestic market. All these years, we have been misinformed about its size by overseas distributors, who gave such projections for their own benefit.?

 Supporting his claim, he points out how the value of tickets is seven times that in Indian theatres. ?Most countries do not have entertainment tax. True, the marketing cost is higher, the exhibitors strike a harder bargain; yet the returns are much more.?

 Other than producing and distributing movies in India, UTV is going for international co-productions. The Namesake is the first in the line. Screwvala had come to Calcutta to ensure a smooth take-off for the shooting of his $ 9.6 million co-production.

 ?I had been in touch with Mira (Nair). Then we met at Wellington Club in Mumbai last November. She wanted me to distribute the film, I offered to produce it. Mira wanted to roll in February-March as she wanted to catch the New York winter. By February the paperwork was done. By June 8, they were through with the US schedule,? he smiles.

 The Namesake, in the UTV chief?s words, is ?a truly Hollywood film?. ?The Indian revenue that would be generated is only two per cent of our global expectations.? The film is unique in having global distribution from Day One of production rather than going in search of a buyer afterwards to the festivals.

 Would a film with Indian characters sell like mainstream Hollywood films? ?My Big Fat Greek Wedding was a Greek story. It did business worth half-a-billion dollars. Nicole Kidman is an Australian, Russell Crowe is from New Zealand, Antonio Banderas is Spanish. They are all Hollywood stars. The Namesake is a story of immigrant Americans. The Ganguli experience is what even migrant Italians or Germans would identify with.?

 It is the treatment of a film that makes it Indian or international, not the story or the characters in it, Screwvala feels. ?Mira knows the American sensibility.? 

 He is all for designing movies that appeal to the target audience. ?Swades did far better abroad than in India as it was aimed at the migrant mindset at the crossroads, rather than the family back home. It would be silly to take D abroad. The gangster concept is well-known abroad. If they have to see a gangster movie, they?d rather see Godfather. A Hindi film that we release outside India as well would have to be quintessentially Indian ? with strong cultural roots ? that would appeal to the south Asians.?

 The Namesake is the second UTV film to be shot in Calcutta. (UTV is distributing Parineeta). ?I have heard about the trouble Vinod had,? he said, commenting on Parineeta producer Vidhu Vinod Chopra?s tiff with the local industry hands. But Screwvala is not concerned. ?Such problems get resolved.? 

 But, he categorically states that there should be flexibility when one is working for a film. ?It cannot be a strictly eight-hour shift. The film industry involves a lot of passion. If a shot is good and things are rolling, one has to continue without looking at the watch,? the producer muses.

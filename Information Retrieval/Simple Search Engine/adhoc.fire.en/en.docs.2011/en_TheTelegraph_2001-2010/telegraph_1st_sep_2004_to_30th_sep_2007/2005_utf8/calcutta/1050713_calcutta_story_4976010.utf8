 While you are sleeping

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 Q: I am 22 and have just 

 completed my graduation. I am suffering from a strange sleeping 

 disorder. I sleep with my head facing south, but still I 

 dont get sound sleep on most days. Nightmares wake 

 me up in the middle of the night and then it becomes very 

 difficult to go back to sleep again. I am on medication 

 for this problem. Please suggest some Feng Shui tips that 

 can be implemented in my bedroom to get rid of the nightmares.

 The 

 Solution: There can be various reasons for your sleep 

 disorder. Make sure you are not sleeping under a beam and 

 are not surrounded by too many electrical points and equipment 

 around your head. There should not be any heavy object or 

 a cupboard over your head. Do not store heavy metallic objects 

 and negative energy items like shoes, slippers and brooms 

 underneath your bed. 

 Feng Shui recommends a clean environment that can nourish you while you are sleeping. Do not litter your room with clothes worn throughout the day. These carry negative energy that they have absorbed during the day. Also ensure that your body is not reflected in a mirror while sleeping. 

 You can protect yourself from 

 nightmares by drawing a line of salt clockwise around three 

 clear sides of the bed. Salt will act as a shield around 

 your bed and absorb the negative energy present in the environment. 

 I would also suggest you to keep away from horror movies 

 and scary books just before you go to sleep.

 Q: Inspite of being blessed 

 with good health and wealth, none of my family members enjoy 

 mental peace. I have a spacious house and the rooms are 

 located in the four corners. The bedrooms are in the south-west, 

 north-west and south-east and the formal living room is 

 in the north-east. This room is unlocked only when there 

 are formal guests in the house and hence cleaned occasionally. 

 The kitchen is in the east and the informal lobby where 

 we all relax is in the west. Is the Feng Shui of my house 

 responsible for the mental condition of the family?

 Hema

 The 

 Solution: Extreme north-east corner of the house 

 is connected with gods blessings and mental peace. 

 It is impossible to overstate the benefits of this corner 

 in any house. The vibrations flowing from this corner bless 

 its occupants with calm and serenity. Since your north-east 

 room is seldom cleaned and is most of the time locked, you 

 are being deprived of the nourishing Chi that flows from 

 this area. This room should be cleaned on daily basis. The 

 windows in the north and east should be opened every morning 

 to embrace the fresh solar Chi flowing into the house from 

 this room. 

 You should also encourage every 

 member of the family to honour this direction in their personal 

 space. This can be done by keeping the area clean, clear 

 of heavy furniture and adorned with an image of god. Keep 

 a holy book here and try to read a few lines every night 

 before going to bed. Such special zones provide therapeutic 

 benefit to each and every member of a family. This will 

 go a long way to bring back the lost peace of your family.

 Q: My teenage son is very 

 quiet, sensitive and lethargic. He lacks energy, ambition, 

 drive and aggressiveness that one needs to succeed in life. 

 Please suggest ways to overcome these problems as these 

 are likely to hamper his career and future life. 

 Yamini

 The 

 Solution: His personality traits suggest that he 

 has excess water element in his body. When in excess, this 

 element suppresses the fire element that gives energy and 

 enthusiasm. This also makes him sentimental and emotional. 

 To bring him out of this balance, shift him to the southern 

 room, which is nourished by fire energy. 

 If this is not possible, then redo his existing room with vibrant colours like red, maroon and purple. Hang a picture of the rising or glowing sun on the southern wall. He should wear clothes of the hues mentioned above and avoid shades of blue and black. These will help restore his bodys balance and hence encourage him to become ambitious and focused in life.

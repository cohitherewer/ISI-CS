 Court sends couple to Puri for patch-up

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court on Wednesday sent a warring couple to Puri for seven days, straight from the courtroom, to develop ?love and confidence?.

 ?After seven days, come straight to the court and tell us about the progress,? the division bench of Justice Amit Talukdar and Justice S.P. Mitra told the couple.

 The court made the decision after an in-camera hearing of a petition filed by the husband, Abhijit Sen, a chartered accountant residing in Kshudiram Sarani, under Thakurpukur police station.

 Sen had pleaded for anticipatory bail as he was apprehending arrest following an FIR lodged by his wife Sharmistha under Section 498A (cruelty and torture).

 In the FIR, Sharmistha had alleged that her mother-in-law wanted to keep her away from her husband.

 After going through it, the judges realised that her main grievance was against her mother-in-law, and not against her husband. The bench asked both Abhijit and Sharmistha to attend the court.

 On Wednesday, the judges discussed their problems with them in detail. Finally, Abhijit was asked to go to Howrah station with his wife, buy tickets to Puri and board a train.

 ?As husband and wife, you need to love each other more and the two of you should have more mutual confidence. We hope the seven-day Puri trip will change your future,? the judges said.

 Abhijit married Sharmistha on January 29, 2003. On February 2 this year, Sharmistha left her in-laws.

 She lodged the FIR on the same day, alleging that her husband and mother-in-law used to torture her regularly for dowry. The police had started a case on the basis of the FIR.

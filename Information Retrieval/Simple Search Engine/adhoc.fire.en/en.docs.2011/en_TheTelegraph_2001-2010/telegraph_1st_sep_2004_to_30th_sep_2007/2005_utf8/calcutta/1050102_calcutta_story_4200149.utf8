The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Three of the ?04 things

 Two 

 and two, at least this once, is making five. If you do not 

 believe me, look at your new calendar. So what if the second 

 is two zeroes. Anyway, let me wish a very happy 2005 to 

 all of you who waste some of their Sunday morning prime 

 time reading my column. 

 This weekend is kind of a bridge between the two years. I thought it might be a good idea to look back and review what all happened in 2004 in the world of marketing. As soon as the idea came to my mind, I realised it was a very bad one. Let me explain. As I did not make copious notes of all that happened each month, looking back will necessarily be memory dependent. That really would mean that anything that I do not remember would be categorised as not significant. This is not only unfair on the events but it indeed is too big an onus on my memory. 

 Be that as it may, I decided to 

 go ahead. What all happened last year that would deserve 

 a serious debate? I may have missed out quite a few , but 

 the trinity that I wish to share with you would certainly 

 have featured in a more exhaustive list. Amitabh Bachchan 

 as an endorser in Indian advertising; the steady but unimaginative 

 growth of mobile communication service; the relative failure 

 of Olympics as an event to catch public imagination. 

 Many feel that Amitabh has overdone it. He is endorsing far too many products on TV. Some argue that AB is getting paid, why should he complain? The only concern could be the danger of killing the goose that is laying the golden eggs. 2004 saw Mr Bachchan merrily endorsing many diverse products ? Red Eveready batteries to Navratan Hair Oil. Even if it is not deliberate, the moot point that 2004 raises is: are these brands being short-changed?

 Hutch and AirTel, Reliance and Idea, mobile communication services remained one of the hottest items in 2004. Yet, it did not evolve significantly. Mr S. Goenka, one presumes, has a cellphone, so has Shri S. Guin, my friendly neighbourhood driver of a hired car. They use different models of cellphones. Their network however is the same and the services they get are not visibly different. The airtime industry has not yet been able to distinguish between their consumers of different purchasing power. Not particularly a creditable achievement for a sunrise industry (Pugs notwithstanding).

 Olympics is often heralded as 

 the greatest show on earth. In 2004 it returned to its birthplace, 

 Athens. For us in India, it came and went. Doordarshan brought 

 us live pictures. Print media did their bit. Yet something 

 was missing. Not many of us responded. Perhaps, sports viewer 

 of today expect garnishing, be it a visual Mandira Bedi 

 or a cerebral Sunny Gavaskar. In Olympics, more than anywhere 

 else, you need someone to hold the viewer?s hand and take 

 him through the maze of games. Sports entertainment has 

 now graduated from the stage of being entirely dependent 

 on the sports itself. What you do around the sports event 

 has become the crucial ingredient of popular acceptance.

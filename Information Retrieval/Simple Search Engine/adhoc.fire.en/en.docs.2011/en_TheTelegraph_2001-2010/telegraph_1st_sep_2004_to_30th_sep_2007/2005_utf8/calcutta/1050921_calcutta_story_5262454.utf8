 Drug addicts and alcoholics harass the staff at medical shops that are open round the clock at odd hours of the night. When refused drugs, they create a scene and even threat the shopkeepers. Police should keep an eye on these shops at night and round up the offenders. After all, these shops are providing an emergency service.

 Churni and Mathabhanga rivers are getting polluted because of the discharge of affluents by a big sugar mill in Nadia district. Local residents and animals using the river water are suffering from various skin disorders. Besides, the fish in the rivers are also dying in large numbers because of the pollutants, reducing the income of the local fishermen. The administration should take measures to stop the river pollution as the earliest.

 Many colleges in the city lack common room facilities. There was a time when common rooms in prestigious colleges were the favourite haunts of the students in their leisure time. At present, students? unions have occupied the common room in the few colleges that have it. In the absence of a proper place to get together and indulge in indoor games and adda on the campus, we find youngsters bunking classes and crowding cinemas and malls. The colleges should make proper arrangements to retain students on its premises for longer periods during the day.

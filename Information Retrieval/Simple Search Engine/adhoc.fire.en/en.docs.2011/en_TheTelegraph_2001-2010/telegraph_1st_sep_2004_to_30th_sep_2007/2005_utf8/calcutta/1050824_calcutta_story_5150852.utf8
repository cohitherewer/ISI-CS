The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

?There are no parents involved?

Debutant director SIDDHARTH RAJ ANAND speaks to Pratim 

D. Gupta about how his mainstream movie brings the taboo topic of live-in relationships 

out in the open

 Saif Ali Khan and Preity Zinta in moments 

from Salaam Namaste

What got you into making films?

My grandfather Inder Raj Anand has written 135 Hindi 

films including Sangam and Ek Duje Ke Liye. My father?s been a producer 

and the last film he produced was Shahenshah. So it was in the lineage. 

When I was 21, I joined the team of Kuch Khatti Kuch Meethi, directed by 

Rahul Rawail, a friend of my dad. Then I was the associate director for Kunal 

Kohli?s Mujhse Dosti Karogi. Finally, for his Hum Tum, I was the 

executive producer, co-scriptwriter and assistant director.

So it was always films for you?

Not really. I was deterred by my family who wanted 

me to get a degree. So I did my CA. I was also supposed to do my MBA from University 

of Texas. When I was about to leave, I finally decided to stay back and get into 

films. So, it was quite late in life that I made up my mind. Sometimes I feel 

why I didn?t go for it earlier. But then again, it?s not that late. I have just 

turned 27.

When did the idea of Salaam Namaste first 

germinate?

I started writing Salaam Namaste while I was 

working on Hum Tum. There was a long break between two schedules and I 

spoke to Adi (producer Aditya Chopra) about the idea. In fact, we kept bouncing 

ideas around it and that?s how the germs of the film were born. Finally, Adi loved 

the storyline and asked me to write the screenplay.

So what is the big idea?

It?s about these two people, played by Preity Zinta 

and Saif Ali Khan, who leave their homes to study in a Melbourne university. There 

they fall in love and spend one year with each other. They live in without marriage. 

It?s that slice of life, one year of their lives, the problems they face and how 

they tackle them. There are no parents involved (laughs).

See, there are lots of Indian people today who live 

in. But the concept is still taboo in India. So we are trying to bring that out 

in the open through a commercial film like Salaam Namaste with mainstream 

actors under a mainstream banner.

How did you get Saif?

I worked with Saif very closely for Hum Tum and 

even before that film released, I wanted him. He also was very keen to be part 

of my first film. But then Hum Tum became such a big hit and I was worried 

whether he would work with a debutant director now. Only Saif could have done 

Salaam Namaste. It?s a young film and among the stars, only Saif can be 

called young. He is still very saleable.

And what about Preity Zinta?

After the script was written, the first name that 

we thought of was Preity. At that time she had just finished working with Yash 

Chopra for Veer-Zaara. So here too there was a question mark whether she 

would work with a newcomer. But she did and she has put in a lot of hard work.

From the promos, the characters look very free 

and wild?

Isn?t that how young people are today? I have tried 

to make the film as close to life as possible. I am sure everybody can identify 

with the characters. Once you watch it, you?ll say, ?Hey, I did this?, or ?I?d 

like to do that?.

Does it help to have the Yash Raj banner behind 

you?

The film wouldn?t have been made without the Yash 

Raj banner. The stars, scale, promotion? everything has been possible because 

of the production house. I would love to only make films for Yash Raj.

Don?t they have a creative say?

They have a say only in terms of the story. Adi gives 

his inputs, very sensible ones. But he also gives you the freedom whether you 

want to accept the inputs or not. Then they have no say as to how the film is 

being shot. It becomes your baby all the way.

With just days to go for the release how are you 

feeling?

I have become very numb, just trying to be an outsider 

and look at everything from a distance. I am also writing my next film which is 

on the opposite spectrum of Salaam Namaste.

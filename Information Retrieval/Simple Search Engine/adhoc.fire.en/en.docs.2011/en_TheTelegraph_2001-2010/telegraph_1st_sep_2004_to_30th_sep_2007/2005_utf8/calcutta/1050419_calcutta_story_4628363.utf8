 Three men from three different nations in the single pursuit of peace. The common thread that ran through the lives and times of Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr and Daisaku Ikeda, despite their diverse backgrounds, was their belief in peace and in the power of the individual to overcome the barriers of religion and race.

 Gandhi, King, Ikeda: A Legacy of Building Peace, hosted by Bharat Soka Gakkai along with Rabindra Bharati University and West Bengal Federation of United Nations Association at Academy of Fine Arts, traces the careers of the three peace-seekers through photographs and written documents. ?The exhibition spreads the message of peace across nations and races. It emphasises the Daishonin Buddhism philosophy of the power of one ? that even one person can change the world,? says Bharat Soka Gakkai east India coordinator Indranath Choudhury.

 Apart from details on his family and education, pictures on Gandhi show the leader steering his stormy political career first through South Africa and then in India with a string of non-violent movements.

 Born in 1929 into a family of preachers, King was pursuing a career in theology when he was inspired by Gandhi?s path of non-violence in gaining freedom. To King, it seemed the path that would lead the way to reforms amidst the unjust laws and racial discrimination in America.

 With several rare photographs of King ? one shows him addressing the historic march on the Washington assembly in 1963 ? the exhibition tracks his role in paving the way for the Civil Rights Act, which ensured voting rights to people irrespective of their colour. 

 Ikeda hailed from a poor family in Japan and developed a dislike for wars when his brother was killed in WWII. Once he came in touch with the Soka Gakkai, Ikeda transformed the lay organisation into a worldwide movement, the Soka Gakkai International.

 ?Both my wife Nilanjanaa and I are members of the Bharat Soka Gakkai. This is an annual exhibition spreading the message of peace and humanity,? said Tollywood star Jisshu, at the Academy of Fine Arts on Thursday evening.

 The display has been globe-trotting ever since it was launched by Morehouse Collegen (alma mater to Martin Luther King Jr) in 2001 in Atlanta. In India, it was first unveiled in Delhi three years ago, before visiting Chennai, Thiruvananthapuram, Bangalore, Mumbai, Pune and Nasik. It will now travel to Santiniketan, Guwahati, Jaipur and Chandigarh.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Sewers in jeopardy

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Despite a Rs 730-crore sewerage project being underway, about 75 per cent of the over 3.5-lakh residents in the added areas of Jadavpur, Behala and Garden Reach are destined to be victimised by mosquitoes that breed in the septic tanks near their houses.

 Engineers in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) believe the completion of the much-publicised Rs 730-crore underground sewerage system, with financial aid from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), will not do away with the septic tanks in the areas. 

 The underground sewer lines which will come up in the area will be only 12 inches wide. Reason: more than 90 per cent of the roads lack adequate width to have the standard 24-inch sewerage lines.

 ?It was a great folly on the part of the state government and the previous CPM-led civic board to take up the underground sewerage scheme for these added areas without aligning the roads,? said mayor Subrata Mukherjee on Friday. 

 He added that neither the government nor the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority took the initiative to align the roads, fearing erosion in the vote bank. 

 CMC engineers said the minimum diameter of the sewer line under the ADB scheme is 24 inches. As per norms, there should be a gap of at least 10 ft between the underground sewer lines and the water supply lines to avoid the risk of water contamination.

 Hence, the minimum road width needed to accommodate the sewer lines, along with the cable and telephone lines and water supply pipelines, would be 20 ft.

 ?The width of most roads and lanes in the added areas of Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur is much less than 20 ft. We have decided to scale down the minimum diameter of the underground sewerage line from 24 inches to 12 inches,? said mayoral council member (water supply) Sovan Chatterjee.

 However, a 12-inch-wide sewer line will get clogged frequently, a senior engineer of the sewerage and drainage department pointed out.

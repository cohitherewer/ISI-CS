 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT IN CHENNAI

 Calcutta might soon have direct flights to Colombo, with Sri Lankan Airlines planning to operate to two more Indian cities. The other new destination is Ahmedabad.

 At present, the airline flies to Chennai, Tiruchi, Bangalore, Cochin, Calicut, Hyderabad, Thiruvananthapuram, Delhi, Mumbai and Gaya. 

 ?India is a key market for Sri Lankan Airlines, which is becoming more popular among travellers flying to Europe, Southeast Asia, the US and West Asia,? commercial head G.T. Jayaseelan said here on Tuesday.

 He added that Sri Lanka was rapidly returning to normalcy after the tsunami tragedy and the airline?s global traffic had gone up. 

 Sri Lanka Airlines has recently won an award for being the best airline in central Asia.

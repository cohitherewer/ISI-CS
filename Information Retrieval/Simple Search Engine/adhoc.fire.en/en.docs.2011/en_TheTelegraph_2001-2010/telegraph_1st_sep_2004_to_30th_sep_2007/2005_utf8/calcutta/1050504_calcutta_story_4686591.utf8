The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Sun power, German aid

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcuttans can generate 200 MW of power on their rooftops by installing photovoltaic panels, feels the state power department, and the Germans are keen to lend a helping hand.

 An Indo-German information and contact programme on renewable energy, organised by the Indo-German Chamber of Commerce in the city on Monday, saw presentations by German experts and alternative power companies that could go a long way in augmenting Calcuttas energy resources in the long term.

 ?It is a wonderful opportunity for us to learn about the latest cost-effective technology being used in the renewable energy sector in the West. We will use this plank to explore collaboration possibilities with the German agencies,? S.P. Gon Chaudhuri, special secretary, power, West Bengal, told Metro.

 He stressed that the state was already a ?national leader in biomass and solar power generation?, thanks to the rural electrification programme. ?The urban milieu could add their mite by installing 1kw solar units on rooftops to begin with. We are offering a rebate of 40 paise per unit for a domestic solar heating system, and will also encourage domestic consumers to plough the surplus power into the grid,? Gon Chaudhuri added. 

 A directive to buy a quantum of power from renewable generating sources has already gone out to the CESC and WBSEB from the regulatory commission.

 The German agencies, also due to meet state officials during their visit, evinced a collective interest in identifying viable local partners. While companies like Schueco International KG and Steca GmbH did presentations on solar energy, Windtest Grevenbroich GmbH and GE Wind Energy GmbH demonstrated new trends in wind energy harvesting.

 ?This interface is a great beginning and could lead to situations where German firms come in with latest, non-polluting renewable energy generating systems. This will cut costs and serve the needs in a large metropolis like Calcutta,? observed Martin Seissler, project manager, renewable energy division of Dena. The Berlin-based agency channelises and recommends projects.

 Seissler agreed with the state?s special secretary, power, that rooftop photovoltaics presented a viable option for Calcutta. ?We have had tremendous response to our ?100,000 roofs programme? back in Germany, doubling capacity in a year. Calcutta has twice the sun-hours we have, and should do even better,? he pointed out.

 Jurgen Raach of solar electronics firm Stecca, looking for a local partner to set up a components unit, was equally bullish. ?The largest demand for photovoltaics in India comes from Bangalore and the Northeast. So, it makes enough sense to set up a facility in Calcutta and we will do it if we find the right collaborator,? he said.

 Raach felt the establishment of Indo-German private partnerships in the renewable energy sector could be the immediate fallout of this interface, but added that political will was crucial to carry forward the bridge-building exercise.

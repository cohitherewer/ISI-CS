 An eclectic combination of comfort and style, Aaramse is a new leisure range of products presented by Sasha designer studio in collaboration with Consorzio CTM Altromercato, an Italian organisation.

 The joint venture is called Sasha Altromercato and is the coming together of four creative heads who believe in the same cause and principles, says a spokesperson for Sasha.

 The range has been created by Indian designers Anshu Arora Sen and Jason Cheriyan with Italian designers Simona Stoopa and Lucy Halamanca Leon.

 Anshu, a graduate from NIFT, retails her designer label from stores like Ogaan, Cinnamon, Amethyst, Kimaya and also exports to countries like Spain and the US.

 Jason, also a student of NIFT, retails from Cinnamon in Bangalore, Cochin and Chennai, Hugli in Calcutta and Ogaan in Delhi. He has even exhibited a clothesline at Livingstone Studio, London.

 Lucy is a freelance designer working with traditional crafts and textiles in various developing countries and also designs for Consorzio CTM Altromercato.

 Simona runs her store at Bolzano in Northern Italy and has been associated with the Fair Trade movement for the past 15 years.

 As the name suggests, the products define leisure and life at a softer pace. The techniques and materials used might be traditional but our designs are contemporary, quot; smiles Anshu.

 The confluence of creativity is the key here. It is an achievement for all of us. The coming together brought in a blend of different cultures, tastes, preferences and creative minds, says Simona.

 The Aaramse range is an assortment of lifestyle products that includes light wood furniture, home textiles and decorative items. All items are made of natural materials like bamboo, wood, handloom and khadi.

 The product line is scheduled to hit the Italian and Indian markets in February and March, respectively.

 This is our Id gift to our customers, but we want to ensure that the maximum number can avail of the scheme, explains Mohammed Arshad Shamim, proprietor of the shop that supplies kurtas and sherwanis to various big stores across the city.

 Kurtas at the two stores feature a lot of embroidery and come in cotton, cotton blends and silks. While Diwali saw bright colours as well as beiges and creams flying off the racks, for Id its back to pristine white.

 An innovation in kurtas is the addition of a special pocket for mobile phones. All our kurtas have a concealed mobile pocket inside, says Arshad.

 The kurtas start from Rs 99 and go up to Rs 10,000. The sherwanis, heavily embroidered with Parsi and zardosi work, range from Rs 399 to Rs 70,000. A special offering for the coming winter wedding season is a Dulha set comprising a sherwani, kurta, pyjama, pagri and mojri for Rs 863.

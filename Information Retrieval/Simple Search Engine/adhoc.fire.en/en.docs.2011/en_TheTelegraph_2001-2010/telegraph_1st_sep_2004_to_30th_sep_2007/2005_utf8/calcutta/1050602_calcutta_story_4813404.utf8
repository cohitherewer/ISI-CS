 Colours of harmony

 A desire for togetherness characterizes the paintings of Sumana Ghosh, a budding young artist, who emphasizes and re-awakens in our minds the importance of relationships in all spheres of life. Enchanting Togetherness, the ongoing maiden exhibition of her paintings and drawings, calls upon the artists personal experiences and familiar, everyday incidents, to paint a picture of life that is happy, peaceful and full of contentment. What shines through in her works is an innocent grace, an almost childlike manner of interpretation and representation, evident in its exclusion of themes and motifs suggestive of suffering, discord or violence. An atmosphere of natural friendliness and geniality is effortlessly achieved through the use of bright, cheerful colours in bold, confident strokes. Images of pet animals and birds, along with human forms, particularly of young girls, evoke a fullness of life that is all-encompassing in its warmth and reflecting an instinctive capability for sharing and caring. At the same time, on a more subterranean level, the paintings bear an attending thought of loneliness and the need to overcome it.

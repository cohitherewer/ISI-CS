 Jamila Khatun is a diminutive woman who stands tall anywhere you meet her ? on the pavement in Tiretta Bazar where she lives, or on the Science City stage, where she received the Abhirup Bhadra Thank You Baba Ma Award at The Telegraph School Awards for Excellence on Wednesday.

 In her late 30s, her address is the footpath in front of a cell phone shop, where she also sweeps the floors for a monthly salary of Rs 100. Another cleaning job in a nearby store fetches her Rs 140. Sometimes, she scavenges for food cast away on the road.

 Childhood polio has left Jamila with a limp in her left leg, but she has taken giant strides in courage and motherhood. ?My life was wasted, but I don?t want my children to suffer the same way,? she says with a quiet determination.

 Her son Nur Alam is a student of St Mary?s Orphanage, Dum Dum. Her daughter Noor Jahan is in a Bengali-medium school in Barasat.

 The two children live away from their mother, but return during vacations to live with her on the pavement.

 How did Jamila Khatun manage it? By pleading with people around to put her children in school. ?I wanted them to have an education, so they could have better lives. I didn?t want them to be influenced by all the drug-taking and drinking here,? says she.

 Jamila was born and brought up in that part of north Calcutta. Orphaned before she turned 10, she learnt to scrounge for a living. For a fistful of rice, she broke the outer part of burnt coals, washed and sold them, collected old nails, hammered them straight and resold them. 

 ?I was married off very young to an old man. He had asthma and died when Nur, my younger child, was still a baby,? she recalls. But sending her children to school was a must. 

 The respect and admiration the two children have for their mother is evident from one simple statement that they both make, separately: ?I love my mother.?

 Another sibling pair saying thank you to their mother through the awards ? instituted in 2003 to pay tribute to parents ? was brother Nikit and sister Maya Mishra, promising students of St Thomas for Boys and St Thomas for Girls.

 Mother Veera is a Russian who married and settled in Calcutta in 1987. After her husband died, she has struggled to provide for her children with her father-in-law?s pension. 

 She hasn?t been given a work permit yet. ?It has been difficult, but I do what I can,? she said, hunting desperately for an opportunity to give lessons in the Russian language.

 Pratima Pramanik, mother of Purnima, a severely handicapped student of Greenfields school, was also applauded. Pratima has two other daughters, and makes ends meet by working as an ayah in Greenfields.

 There was also Antarip Roy?s mother, who begs and borrows money to support her son?s chess talents.

 And Paras Rajwalia?s parents. Paras was born with too much water in his body, which has distorted his appearance. But their belief in their son has inculcated in him a rare self-confidence.

 Subhankar Mondal?s parents received resounding applause for their dedication to their two handicapped sons. Their father is a pheriwala from Kashiadanga, South 24-Parganas. Their mother carried both children to school every day, walking for three km. Subhankar passed Madhyamik 2005 with 65.9 per cent, while his younger brother is in Class VIII. Now, they?ve been given a tricycle to ease their burden.

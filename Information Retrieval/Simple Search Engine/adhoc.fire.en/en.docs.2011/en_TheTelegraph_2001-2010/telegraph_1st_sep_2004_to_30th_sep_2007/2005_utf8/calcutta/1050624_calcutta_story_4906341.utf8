 Model Anusua gets a pristine white bridal makeover at Shakamvari

 Irrespective of weather, geographical location and personal tastes, brides in India are most commonly required to choose from the bright red and orange families while deciding on the attire for her special evening.

 A little variation in the colour palette is at best allowed for the various peripheral functions, but even then, white usually remains a strict no-no for wedding-related occasions in most parts of the country.

 Beautician Gouri Bose of Shakamvari, however, has had the privilege of dressing up about half-a-dozen brides in her 23-year career in pristine white on the wedding evening. 

 Bose shared this classic but rather unusual look with Goodlife as she transformed model Anusua into a head-turner in bright white. 

 Wedding wear

 Though most Indian communities dont consider white auspicious for weddings, with changing times some brides are opting for the unique look that only white can create, says Bose.

 The beautician draped Anusua in a Shaina NC white georgette sari with the pallu and border embellished with patchwork, sequins and white embroidery. The heavy pallu gives the bride a dressy look that is further accentuated by five different jewellery sets that range from a sea-shell choker with meenakari work to a knee-length chain. 

 Matching bangles with all five sets adorn her wrists and chandelier-pearl earrings hang from the ears. A silver net veil, chandan designs on the forehead and white flowers in her hair complete the alternative look.

 The look is far from stark or minimalist. It looks very bridal, but stands out because of the unique colour code, adds the lady behind the makeover. 

 Facelift facts

 Since white is the dominant colour of the whole look, the make-up has to be brighter than usual, explains Bose.

 She has applied the base make-up using a foundation that is a shade brighter than Anusuas complexion. The wax-based foundation apparently ensures the make-up stays on for 24 hours without any touch-up. The base is completed with a dab of translucent powder on top.

 Bose then created a light chandan pattern on the models forehead with body paints. This is easy to use since it is water and sweat proof. Moreover, it can be removed like a sticker in minutes, she reveals. The off-white design is embellished with red bindis and stones to lend an ornamental touch. 

 The eye make-up was done with extra care as the model had dark circles under her eyes, which has been covered with concealer. 

 To brighten up Anusuas rather small eyes, Bose used a range of products. These include silver shimmer to highlight the area below the brow bone, bronzer dust shadow, a line of golden glitter on the upper lid before using the blue-black liner, mascara and golden dust on the lid.

 I don?t think multiplexes are killing single-screen theatres. While multiplexes offer greater choice as well as better facilities, their ticket prices are much higher than single-screen theatres. The lower middle-class would continue to frequent single-screen halls.

 Most people cannot afford the multiplex ticket prices, especially on weekend evenings. If their ticket prices are slashed, single-screen theatres will find it impossible to sustain themselves.

 The multiplexes are closing down single-screen theatres, and the latter should not expect any state protection. The multiplexes provide facilities commensurate with their higher ticket prices and hence, are attracting more patrons. With business dwindling, single-screen theatres would find it difficult to keep their ticket prices low.

 Multiplexes and single-screens have separate markets and can survive independently. While multiplexes primarily entertain the higher-end of the society, the average cine-goer generally visits single-screen theatres. He visits multiplexes only on special occasions. Single-theatres will disappear only if the majority of the population becomes affluent.

 Multiplexes are not killing single-screen theatres. The two offer totally different experiences. Multiplexes offer a wide array of add-ons to the viewer, but there is no justification for the steep ticket prices. The viewer, after all, can watch only one movie at a time, and food and drinks have to bought separately.Movies at the multiplexes should not strain the finances of the common citizen.

 Multiplexes are killing single-screen theatres and there?s nothing that the latter can do. Most people prefer the complete entertainment package offered by the multiplexes. Single-screen halls will, however, continue to flourish outside the city.

 Multiplexes and single-screen halls offer different qualities of services and target different classes of people. Multiplexes offer a total entertainment package, including high-quality visuals and good food. Hence, their ticket prices will definitely be on the higher side. Middle-class people cannot afford multiplex rates and therefore choose single-screen halls.

 Multiplexes will never finish off single-screen halls. They look to attract people with disposable income, in search for comfort and exclusivity. For an average person, a show at the multiplex remains a luxury he can ill afford on a regular basis. For students and those who watch films frequently, single-screen halls remain the more attractive option. In addition, there are only a handful of multiplexes, which can?t cater to all film-lovers.

 The popularity of video CDs, rampant piracy, cable channels and increasing ticket rates at theatres have considerably reduced the number of cine-goers. Even then, most people prefer single-screen theatres due to the lower ticket prices. Also, there are only a few multiplexes. They will eventually be forced to slash ticket prices to attract more viewers.

 Multiplexes are undoubtedly killing single-screen halls. Most people want to watch films on giant screens and in a good environment, which single-screen halls cannot provide at the moment. Hence, several halls have downed shutters in the recent past to make way for multiplexes or malls.

 Multiplexes are certainly attracting more viewers than single-screen halls. They offer more facilities, including hygienic food. Adjacent shopping malls and heritage plazas are also big draws.

 There is no doubt that multiplexes are killing single-screen theatres. Initially, multiplexes used to charge very high ticket prices and only looked to attract the privileged class. With increased competition, the ticket prices have come down drastically. There?s no longer a reason for the middle-class to avoid the multiplexes.

 diptimoy ghosh,

 Multiplexes are providing stiff competition to single-screen theatres. However, they should not be allowed to charge outrageous ticket rates. The single-screen halls are suffering as they are poorly maintained. The better-maintained ones continue to do brisk business.

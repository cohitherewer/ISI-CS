 Killer wave lashes tourist

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Digha sea in high tide claimed a 55-year-old tourist on Monday morning.

 A huge wave crashed on homoeopath Hiralal Banerjee, resident of Bidhan Sarani, and sucked him into the sea while he was sitting on a concrete slope on the Old Digha beach, along with his 15-year-old son and a friend. The sea returned the body after 90 minutes.

 On Friday, the waters had claimed a 24-year-old student, Subhendu Chakraborty.

 Banerjee, along with son Sayan Subhra and wife Sukla, left Calcutta for the sea resort on Saturday night. 

 They were accompanied by family friend Radheshyam Ghosh and his family. The Banerjees were scheduled to return on Tuesday.

 The group checked into a hotel in Old Digha around 12.30 pm on Sunday. On Monday morning, Banerjee left the hotel at 10.15 and sat for some time in a children?s park nearby. Then he went to the beach, where he was joined by his son and Ghosh.

 ?The three were sitting on the slope when a huge wave leaped up and lashed them around 11.15 am. Banerjee could not be seen after the wave receded. His body was found an hour-and-a-half later, 100 metres away,? said Dilip Bhadra, officer-in-charge of Digha police station.

 News of the mishap was conveyed to Banerjee?s relatives by his son. ?Sayan was crying inconsolably when he called us at 11.30 am and said his father was missing. He called again after a few minutes to say his father had not been traced,? said Subhra Sinha, Banerjee?s sister-in-law.

 She wondered how Banerjee could be swept away by the sea. ?We went to Puri in March. Hiralal, Sukla and Sayan were with us. There we discovered how Hiralal was scared of the sea. He could never have ventured far off the shore.?

 Subhra recalled having spoken to Sukla hours before they left on Saturday night. ?She was upbeat about the trip. I don?t know what will happen to her and Sayan now.? 

 Hiralal?s mother, who lives in Naihati, North 24-Parganas, has not been informed about the tragedy. Hiralal had settled down at his in-laws? house in Calcutta after his marriage 24 years ago. Subhra said their family members have left for Digha to bring back the body.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Climber remains in coma

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The condition of mountaineer Anita Sarkar continues to be critical. Sarkar was involved in a road accident on Sashthi and has been in a coma ever since.

 ?Our doctors are monitoring her condition round-the-clock. We hope she will respond soon,? said Rupak Barua, vice-president of the Peerless Hospital and BK Roy Research Institute.

 Metro had reported on Monday how the 40-year-old mountaineer, who had conquered Mt Island peak of Nepal last April, was felled by a treacherously potholed stretch of Rashbehari Avenue.

 Her motorcycle had hit a pothole and then slammed into the concrete bed of the tram tracks near Triangular Park. She was not wearing a helmet.

 Representatives of several mountaineering institutes in and around the city flocked to the hospital on Tuesday to inquire about Anita.

 ?She has been a role model for so many of us. It is unfortunate that Calcutta?s ill-maintained roads have caused such a life-threatening injury,? said Sanjay Bhattacharjee, a trainee mountaineer.

 Tuesday also saw police rouse the PWD brass to carry out an inspection of the site and initiate necessary action.

 ?We have taken stock of the situation and have informed our senior officers about the condition of the road,? said a Lake police station officer.

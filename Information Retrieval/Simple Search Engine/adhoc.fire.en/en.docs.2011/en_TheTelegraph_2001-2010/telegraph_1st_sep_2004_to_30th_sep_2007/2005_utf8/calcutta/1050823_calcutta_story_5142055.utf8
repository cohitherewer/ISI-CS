 Musical confluence

 The meeting of the various modes of the performing arts is always an exciting phenomenon. Innovations in music and dance can forge magical relationships that far surpass their individual brilliance. Hosted by Patton, Chateau Indage, McDowells and Open Doors, Sangam, a confluence of Rabindrasangeet, Manipuri dance and Indian classical vocal and instrumental music, thus promises to be a unique and unforgettable musical experience. Featuring performances by celebrated maestros and talented young prodigies, the programme creatively propagates the universality of India?s cultural heritage. Soumik Datta (classical sarod player) and Sasha A.K. Ghosal (trained in Indian classical vocal music and Rabindrasangeet) move away from their traditional styles to render an experimental piece. Renowned Rabindrasangeet artiste Pramita Mallik and eminent Manipuri danseuse Priti Patel mesmerise the audience with an original interpretation of a Tagore classic.

 Event: Sangam, a programme of Rabindrasangeet, Manipuri dance and Indian classical music

 When: Today at 6.45 pm

 Where: GD Birla Sabhagar

 Another drama festival has taken off, this time in the satellite township. The Salt Lake Theatre group is hosting its third consecutive annual festival from February 3 to 6.

 In the refurbished Laban Hrad auditorium in BD Block, the festival was inaugurated on Thursday evening. 

 On Night One, Sabitri Chatterjee took the stage, for the first time in Salt Lake, before a capacity crowd. The veteran artiste enacted the role of an actress making a comeback in a male-dominated world of theatre in Notibilash, a Calcutta Repertory Theatre production, directed by Kunal Pramanik. 

 Arun Mukhopadhyay?s group Chetana will stage Nirnoy on February 5. February 4 has been allotted for children?s theatre and two performances ? Adhunik Ramayan by the hosts and E Amar Desh by Esho Natak Shikhi ? are on the cards.

 The first is in the lyrical mode, conceptualising the epic in a contemporary scenario. The second talks about national integration in an innovative manner. The finale promises to be a laugh riot with the hosts dramatising the comedy Ja Noi Tai. 

 ?Sunday is already close to being sold out, though the next two days can still take in more people,? says general secretary of Salt Lake Theatre group Hirak Subhra Chatterjee.

 Buoyed by successes of the earlier years and the presence of big guns, the hosts are doing their best to make this a regular event on the city?s cultural calendar. At stake is the accomplishment of a noble aim. 

 The productions will showcase budding talents, tickle the ribs but most importantly, they will raise funds for tsunami survivors. 

 The hosts handed over a substantial amount from the proceeds of the sale of tickets to the ABP Tsunami Fund on Thursday evening.

In a span of 10 days, Footsbarn, a travelling theatre 

troupe from France, will roll into town to stage Perchance to Dream, presented 

by Prithvi Theatre Festival in association with Hutch, Seagull Foundation for 

the Arts and others. 

 The production is a collage of extracts from various Shakespeare plays that Footsbarn has staged over the past 30 years, which include A Midsummer Night?s Dream, King Lear, Hamlet, Macbeth and Romeo and Juliet. To mark the occasion, a five-day festival of films was put up at Seagull Media Resource Centre starting February 1. 

 The showcase, Travelling Players, began with the one-and-a-half-hour-long film Shakespearewallah, directed by James Ivory and produced by Ismail Merchant. 

 The line-up also featured Mathilde Daudy?s documentary L?Odyss?e: An Indian Odyssey, Dominique Deluze?s 55-minute film Royal de luxe, retour d?Afrique, Rajiv Krishnan?s Tamil film Vesham and Yasujiro Ozu?s Japanese film Floating Weeds.

 Footsbarn takes the stage on February 13 and 14 at GD Birla Sabhagar.

 In an endeavour to stage the ?experimental theatre of Rabindranath Tagore? and also to celebrate the cause of International Human Rights for Women?s Freedom, theatre group Swabak presents Tagore?s Shasthi at Rabindra Sadan on February 6, at 6.30 pm. 

 The story about two brothers under the zamindar?s tyrannical rule is a telling tale of the social position of women in 19th century rural Bengal. 

 On February 10, Theatrecian presents Edward Albee?s The Zoo Story at Gyan Manch, 7 pm. The play reflects an image of man?s loneliness and inability to connect with others.

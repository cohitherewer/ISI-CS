The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Good looks amp; groundstrokes

 Can Sania beat the baggage of her 

 chosen sport to become the dream brand merchant?

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 This 

 was last Wednesday. Star Sports was beaming matches live 

 from Wimbledon. Safin was playing Mark Philippoussis; Federer 

 was playing his second round match. Many other matches were 

 due to start. Yet Alan Wilkinson, the anchor for the programme, 

 kept announcing live coverage of the next match on Centre 

 Court ? Sania Mirza was taking on number five seed Kuznetsova. 

 The pre-match talk show featured Vijay Amritraj and Sunny 

 Gavaskar.

 Alan asked Vijay, when was the 

 last time an Indian played a singles match on the Centre 

 Court of Wimbledon? Vijay could not remember anyone after 

 him in 1985 when he beat Yannick Noah in four sets. Soon 

 it was realised that no Indian woman tennis player had ever 

 played on the hallowed court. That raised the level of conviction. 

 All of them sang a chorus: we are about to witness history.

 Creating this hype was a deliberate 

 ploy. This is not to say that Sania does not deserve it. 

 If her match with Kuznetsova is any indication, we possibly 

 are witnessing the best ever woman tennis player that this 

 country has produced. How far she can progress on the circuit, 

 whether the spin on her second serve should become a lot 

 more malicious? are issues that are best left to the experts.

 One question about her however 

 merits a discussion in this column. Can she give Shah Rukh 

 and Sachin, Aishwarya and Amitabh a run for their money? 

 Is she the star that will launch a thousand brands? Does 

 she have what it takes to be the star that the advertisers 

 seek?

 The kid certainly exudes star 

 quality. She is blessed with the looks. Her poise and confidence 

 are even more amazing. Earlier last week she was being interviewed 

 on the same channel by Vijay Amritraj. Vijay is known to 

 be a skillful interviewer; he takes on celebrities with 

 a lot of respect and a matching dose of naughtiness. He 

 made no exception for Sania. She matched Vijay word for 

 word, wit for wit.

 All these are necessary qualities. 

 But alas, they are far from sufficient. The business of 

 celebrity advertising has much to do with attracting eyeballs 

 to the communication by the reputation of the celebrity. 

 In our country most eyeballs are glued either to cricket 

 or to Hindi movies.

 Tennis remains a poor cousin. 

 It simply does not attract the numbers. So, an exclusive 

 boutique shop or an expensive range of luggage apart, Sania 

 may not be able to deliver what a mass advertiser wants. 

 Witness the number of endorsement contracts that Vishwanathan 

 Anand has bagged. Sania obviously is better placed than 

 Anand. Her age and gender give her a headstart. Tennis is 

 more popular in our country than chess. And tennis is more 

 TV-friendly than chess is. So if Sania wins a Grand Slam 

 or two (!) tennis can actually acquire an urban middle-class 

 fan following. If that happens Sania can bag all the contracts, 

 from fairness creams to anti-dandruff shampoos.

 Amitabh Bachhan, in an interview 

 many years ago, had said that audiences are often confused 

 between a character in the movie and the actor who plays 

 it. He felt that people mistake their love for Vijay, a 

 character he has played many times, as their affection for 

 Big B. Modesty apart, he had a point. In the case of Sania, 

 it is possibly the reverse ? love for her is often mistaken 

 as craze for tennis. However, the advertisers are usually 

 a far more cautious breed. Most of them are interested in 

 the product of the two ? the sheer number of her fans. Sania 

 carries a baggage ? her chosen sport.

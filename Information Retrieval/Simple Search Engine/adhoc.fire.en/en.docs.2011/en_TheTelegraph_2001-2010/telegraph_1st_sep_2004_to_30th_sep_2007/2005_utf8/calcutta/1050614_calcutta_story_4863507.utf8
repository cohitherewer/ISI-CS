The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 It?s lotus vs lotus to add to the muddle

 - Poll rivals with matching names, symbols

 ?Vote for Subrata Dasgupta (Padma),? screams a CPM banner. ?Press on the lotus (padma) symbol to elect Subrata Gupta,? roars the adjacent BJP poster. 

 Blessed are voters who cannot read in Santoshpur. Those who can, are caught in this tangle of names and symbols. ?The political scenario this time is confusing as it is. Why did they have to add to the confusion here?? asks a resident, pointing to the election graffiti on Santoshpur Avenue.

 The candidates are blaming each other for the same-name muddle. ?We had put up our hoardings much in advance. Moreover, since this is a sure seat for us, the BJP did not want to take a risk. So they found someone ? from far-away Bagha Jatin ? to match my name. Even the design of their graffiti is similar,? complains Dasgupta, known in political circles as confidential assistant to minister Kanti Ganguly.

 ?Someone else was supposed to contest here. They changed the candidate to confuse people,? Gupta retorts. ?Rather, I am the one who stands to lose in this confusion.? 

 He recounts how, during door-to-door campaigns, voters have mistaken him for his rival. ??How dare you come to us for votes when roads are getting inundated after every shower and mosquitoes are breeding freely in the drains?? they ask me. His name has become a millstone around my neck,? the BJP candidate says.

 Dasgupta?s nickname, used prominently on the banners, has put an ironic touch to the fight against flower power. ?I am a local boy. Most people here know me as Padma. Why just the election material? We have applied for the nickname to be there even on the ballot papers,? the CPM candidate says.

 Dasgupta points to adjacent wards like 109, where party candidate Samarendra Roy goes with his nickname Swapan or 93, where the hoardings declare the CPM nominee to be Ranen (Rana) Mitra. ?It is common practice,? he argues.

 Gupta is not willing to give up the lotus without a fight. ?For him (Dasgupta), Padma is a fancy name. But my dream is padma. It is deeply linked to our country, our religious heritage. What do they know of such things when they are ascetics and believe in an alien philosophy?? he counters.

 Veteran politician Saugata Roy admits that fielding Independents who are namesakes of the rival candidate is an old ploy to cut into the latter?s votes. ?In the 2004 polls, there was such a candidate in Sudip Bandopadhyay?s constituency.?

 If one of the two Subratas ends up muddling the other?s calculation, the last man smiling will be Subrata Mukherjee, present on every banner of UDA nominee Shyamal Mukherjee.

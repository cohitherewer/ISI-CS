 On a sympathy overdrive

 - Both CPM and Trinamul try to win over Sarobar squatters

 OUR BUREAU

 With the eviction process scheduled to begin on Friday, squatters along the railway tracks between Tollygunge and Ballygunge on Tuesday found sympathisers from both sides ? the CPM as well as the Trinamul Congress ? by their side.

 With the Assembly elections scheduled for early next year, the CPM on Tuesday was quite open about espousing their cause. While Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee assured the squatters that her party would stop the eviction at any cost, CPM leaders ? minister Asok Bhattacharya and chief whip of the state Assembly Rabin Deb ? assured them that the state government would look at the matter with ?humanitarian concern?.

 Bhattacharya and Deb on Tuesday attended a rally at Esplanade, organised by Bustee Federation, a CPM-controlled organisation of slum-dwellers, and expressed their sympathy. 

 Earlier in the day, members of the federation met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Writers? Buildings and said the squatters would have nowhere to go if they were evicted. Later, minister Bhattacharya joined them in the meeting.

 ?The state government is not involved in the matter, and the decision has been taken by the court. If the railway had offered land for the squatters, we could have arranged to build dwelling units for them. But since that is not happening, the chief minister has told me that the government is considering providing some financial assistance to them,? said Bhattacharya.

 He added: ?Earlier, an all-party delegation from the state Assembly had met the railway authorities, demanding alternative land for the squatters. They did not respond.? 

 The minister said the state government was not responsible for the way things have turned out for the squatters. 

 ?We did not file the petition before the high court, seeking the eviction of people who have been living there since 1947. The government will look at the matter with sympathy, but the railway, too, must come forward,? he declared.

 While addressing a crowded rally at gate number 3 of the Gobindapur area in the evening, Mamata Banerjee declared that her partymen will fight to the end to stop the ?inhuman torture? on the squatters in the name of eviction. She came down not only on the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government but also the Centre.

 ?Was Buddhadebbabu?s government sleeping all this while? Why have they suddenly become sympathetic towards poor people like you? Why can?t they ask the Centre to offer you alternative land?? she thundered at the gathering. 

 She warned the administration that it could only launch the eviction drive over her dead body.

 On Wednesday, Tollygunge-Ballygunge Rail Colony Sangram Committee will start a march towards Writers? Buildings, demanding alternative land before eviction.

Books, bites amp; lots of browse

Five years ago, a search for your favourite title 

took you on a ubiquitous trek down College Street. The light bite options amid 

the browsing invariably translated into a spicy egg roll or fish fry from a road-side 

stall. 

But that was before the upscale economy stores came 

in. Replete with sleek packaging and presentation, and well-trained staff and 

peripheral utility services to boot, the new-age malls have an air-conditioned 

edge over the dust and grime of makeshift stalls. 

Read half the book in the cool environs before purchasing 

it or check out all the tracks before you take home a compact disc. Grab a bite 

and pick a cute little gift for someone special? Goodlife browses one such 

store?

Fact file: Emami Landmark Store in Emami Market 

on 3 Lord Sinha Road.

Built over an area of 20,000 sq ft, the store was 

launched on October 31, 1999.

It boasts books, music, food and lots of goodies to 

satisfy the impulsive buying streak. 

Word power: From thrillers to theology, from 

classics to comics ? you can choose from over one lakh titles here. ?Though we 

are not a book speciality store, we have most of the titles one can think of. 

Landmark provides more variety than a speciality store,? claims Gautam Jatia, 

CEO, Landmark. 

The outlet also has an enviable collection of books 

on cinema, romance and classics. 

nMusic mania: From Pink Floyd to Police, from 

Beatles to Bryan Adams, you are sure to lay your hands on all genres and time 

periods. ?Landmark is specially known for its collection of jazz and Hindustani 

classical music. We also store a vast collection of instrumental music.? The indexing 

and the replenishment of the stocks ensure that buyers get to buy whatever they 

step in for. 

Kids stuff: While you are busy browsing, leave 

your kid at the newly built 3,500 sq ft kids zone on the terrace. Apart from colourful 

toys and books, there is an open air play zone to keep tiny terrors busy for hours 

while you shop. 

?It?s a huge favourite with the kids. As soon as they 

enter the store they make their way to this section. There is a vast range of 

imported toys to attract their attention, ranging from building blocks and board 

games to sporting equipment and racing cars,? says Jatia. 

Lego, Funskool and Mattel are some of the international 

brands that can be spotted here. ?We do not want to project it only as a playing 

arena though. The collection of books for the young adults here is unparalleled,? 

adds Jatia. From Ruskin Bond, R.K. Narayan, to Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys ? there?s 

lots for the bookworms in the gang. 

Utility try: A vast range of consumer utility 

items brings up a colourful rear at the store. From stationary and ceramic items 

to greeting cards and aromatic candles? there are endless options for shopaholics. 

The section dedicated to perfumes boasts of brands 

like Escada, Burberry, Adidas, Benetton, Azzaro and Davidoff, with prices ranging 

between Rs 140 and Rs 4,000. Aromatic candles provide more scent in attractive 

shapes of fruits, flowers, hearts and balls, priced between Rs 5 and Rs 50. The 

stationary section stocks everything from pins to a Monte Blanc pen. 

Light bite: A small sit-down cafeteria provides 

shop succour. Hotdogs, sandwiches, coffee and soft drinks can be grabbed while 

on the go.

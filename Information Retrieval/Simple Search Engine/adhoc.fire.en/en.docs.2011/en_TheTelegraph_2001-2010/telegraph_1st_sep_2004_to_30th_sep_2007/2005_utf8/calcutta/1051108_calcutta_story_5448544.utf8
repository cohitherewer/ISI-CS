 $100-million India purse 

 - Service body lines up events agenda on board meeting eve

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The International Association of Lions Clubs plans to spend around $100 million in India on various projects by 2008.

 Ashok Mehta, 2005-2006 president of the association ? the largest service organisation in the world ? made the announcement on Monday, ahead of the first board meeting of the organisation in Calcutta.

 Lions Club representatives from countries such as the USA, Japan, Italy, China, Germany, France and Brazil are expected to attend the meeting, which gets underway on Wednesday.

 ?Besides global issues, long-term planning for India would also be discussed at the board meeting,? said Mehta, the second Indian to become president of the international body in its 88-year history.

 The delegates are also scheduled to meet chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi.

 On the occasion of the meet, the organisation has lined up several events in the city. A community marriage programme will be held on Friday. A self-employment programme for women and support programme for the disabled ? where tricycles and wheel-chairs will be distributed ? are lined up for Sunday.

 Children?s Day will be celebrated by presenting gifts to kids from orphanages.

 Value-based education for children and blindness in children are the two major areas that the association is currently concentrating on.

 ?We started the education programme in 1990. Initially, it was only in English. Now, we are offering it in other regional languages as well, including Bengali,? disclosed Mehta. 

 Under the programme, children are coached in developing their personality and taught to ?say no to the bad things in life?.

 ?In some places where we are conducting the education programme, parents tell us that the children now stop them from doing things like jumping red lights and smoking,? Mehta said. 

 ?For blindness caused in children by diabetes, we have started a Rs 3.75-million pilot project in Andhra Pradesh. In another programme, we will be distributing 200,000 spectacles to children over two years.? Blindness in children would be top priority on the Lions? agenda for the next 10 years, informed Mehta.

 The association is also reviewing the performance of its 100 hospitals across the country. ?According to the assessment, we will give them more equipment,? Mehta signed off.

Life

 Feminine, flirty and very filmi

 From Mili in Rangeela to Meera in Yuva, from Aarti in Raja Hindustani to Anjali in Kuch Kuch Hota Hai... The magic of Manish Malhotra has defined them all. The Bollywood fashion guru shares his style secrets with Shradha Agarwal

 She just has to be feminine. Thats how ace designer Manish Malhotra likes to describe his trademark Bollywood heroine. Tell him that just a cartload of femininity doesnt MM material make, and he muses: Really? You mean theres more to it? What you see in the movies are only characters. I dress them accordingly. Sometimes its Chameli, other times its Anjali.

 Well, characterisation is all right, but surely theres something more to the MM look. Well yes, my girls are essentially feminine, confident and intelligent? Even the sporty characters have to look pretty and proper.

 A known stickler for detail and perfection, the style guru gives out some of his best-kept trade secrets to GoodLife. 

 So read on to know how to look like a Manish Malhotra heroine? total filmi style.

 Make-up magic

 Always soft and neat, Manish doesnt endorse the untidy look one bit. 

 The overall look of the face has to be nude and soft. 

 The lipstick should always be a brownish pink, topped with lots of gloss.

 Not too much colour in the form of garish eye shadow, he prefers the natural or the smudged smoky look.

 An elaborate hairdo has to be balanced with a no make-up feel. 

 Signature style

 In the movies, the signature look is determined by the character, but in reality you can decide on it according to your environment and personality. The look has to be consistent and very signature, says Manish. 

 Best examples of the MM signature are Kareenas kurtis and long skirts in Yuva and her short skirts in the upcoming 36 China Town

 Since Kajol is playing a blind music student in Fanaah, she will be wearing a lot of crushed skirts and kurtis, very Indian in fabric and feel, says Manish about one more of his signature looks.

 Sensual silhouette

 The outlines are essentially very structured and fitted. Balance with a fitted top if you are wearing something flared below.

 My heroines never look bulky, says Manish. He suggests well-cut skirts with no gathers around the waist.

 Badly-cut empire lines are a strict no-no. They look like maternity wear, he frowns. In short, tapered is the way to go.

 Awesome accessories

 One cool bag is an absolute necessity.

 The put-together look might be in, but it should be well thought out, not random, is the advice.

 Long earrings and a bare neck is typical Manish.

 An interesting neckpiece looks complete with simple ear studs.

 Oxidised or dull gold jewellery is a must.

 Coral and turquoise are the big stones of the moment. Wear them as jewellery or as embellishments on your ensemble, offers Manish.

 Colour charisma

 Colours for me arent just colours. Apart from being a fashion designer, I am a painter as well, reveals Manish.

 White and beige are always welcome, but to be used very thoughtfully. 

 Add vibrant hues in your light-coloured ensemble with the help of bright accessories like shoes, bags or jewellery. 

 At a time when the Hindi film industry was going all colour, I introduced pastel shades; so never hesitate to bring about change in the colour story, he signs off.

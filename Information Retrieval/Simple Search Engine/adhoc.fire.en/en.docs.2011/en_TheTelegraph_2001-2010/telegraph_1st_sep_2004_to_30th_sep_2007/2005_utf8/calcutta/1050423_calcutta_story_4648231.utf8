 The Larousse Gastronomique has been accepted as the kitchen Bible for decades. First published in 1938, the Librarie Larousse book is considered one of the most authoritative guides on food.

 If you are looking to sink your teeth into European cuisine, the core encyclopaedia is an invaluable tool.

 The 2001 update (translated from the 2000 French version) is an improvement on the last English edition published in 1988. It expands on world food content, including more information on American and Asian cuisine. The Larousse Gastronomique is available at Crossword (hardcover Rs 1,995, paperback Rs 995).

 There are two more companion texts devoted to two sections of the book ? wine and recipes. It could be the right time to invest in the Larousse Encyclopedia of Wine (Rs 1,745, picture by Rashbehari Das), with the city?s growing interest in the beverage.

 The volume, written by Christopher Foulkes, concentrates on European wines, but gives an adequate overview of New World wines from North and South America and Australia. It provides good grounding in the technicalities ? how wine is made, how to interpret a label, how best to order in a restaurant. For the uninitiated, it provides invaluable know-how on how to serve a wine ? decanting, glasses, corkscrews ? and how to choose the right wine with your meal.

 Finally, there is a four-paperback box set including over 2,500 recipes, called the Larousse Gastronomique Recipe Collection (Rs 2,440). There are books devoted to Classic Meat, Classic Fish and Seafood, Classic Vegetables and Salads and Classic Desserts, Cakes and Gateaux. While some of the ingredients may seem exotic, the mouth-watering recipes could inspire you to innovate.

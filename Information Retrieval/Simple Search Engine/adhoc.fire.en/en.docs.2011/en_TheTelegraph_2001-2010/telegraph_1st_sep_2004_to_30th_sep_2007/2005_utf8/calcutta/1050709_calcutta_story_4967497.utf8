 Time: 3:22 pm. Place: Chandni Chowk Metro station.

 No cop at the entrance, only a beggar sits there. The metal detector near the entrance to the platform beeps as a passenger with a bag passes through it. But there is no one to check the bag. 

 Contrary to what the authorities have promised, securitymen are neither on the platform nor on the trains.

 The day after a series of blasts rocked the London Underground, prompting the Metro Railway authorities to sit up and plan elaborate security measures, it was business as lax as usual at most stations.

 Security was tighter at the two terminals ? Tollygunge and Dum Dum, where Railway Police Force (RPF), Metro Railway Police (MRP) and paramilitary personnel scanned passengers ? but it was all but non-existent at most stations in between.

 A police team, led by joint commissioner (organisation) Sudhir Mishra and deputy commissioner (south) N. Ramesh Babu, on Friday, reviewed security at all stations, save the two terminals that are at ground level. Representatives of Metro Railway and RPF accompanied the team.

 ?Certain loopholes have been detected and we will bring them to the Metro authorities? notice at Saturday?s meeting,? said deputy commissioner (headquarters) Anuj Sharma. The number of MRP personnel provided by the city force would be raised from the present 77, he added. Special counselling would also be conducted for the ticket-checking staff.

 A senior RPF officer said the authorities had decided to deploy three jawans on each train and two on each platform.

 ?We are identifying the lapses and security will be beefed up further,? said Metro Railway general manager P. Sudhakar. He will speak to RPF officers attached to Eastern Railway and seek additional forces.

 On Thursday, soon after news of the blasts reached the city, senior Metro officials went into a huddle and announced a number of steps to ensure passenger safety.

 These included deployment of personnel at all stations and on trains. They would be on the lookout for any ?unusual or suspicious movement? of passengers and, if needed, check their bags.

 But a spot scan on Friday revealed that except at Tollygunge, Dum Dum, Esplanade and Park Street, Metro personnel could not care less about security matters. 

 Passengers were seen going in and coming out with bags that beeped but failed to draw the attention of the ticket-checking staff even once.

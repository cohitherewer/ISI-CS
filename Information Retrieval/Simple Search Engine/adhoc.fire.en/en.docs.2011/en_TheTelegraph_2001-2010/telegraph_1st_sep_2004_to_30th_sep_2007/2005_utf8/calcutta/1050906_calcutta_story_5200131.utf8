 Subtle verses to fill the spaces

 Poetry is blue wind, 

 Poetry is the poet?s hope. 

 Poetry is the face of my mother 

 as I lie alone in bed at night.

 Where is poetry born? Is it just in the well-cultivated minds of fortune?s children? In the aantel classrooms of renowned institutes? Or can young people living on the fringes of society also choose poetry to express their feelings, their lives? 

 Probably with these very questions in mind, Sahar Somani and Bishan Samaddar had started Kalam: Margins Write, a creative-writing programme for marginalised youth, in the monsoon of 2004. An initiative of the Daywalka Foundation, a US-based NGO, the 20-week workshop had participants from a youth group in Kalighat called Diksha and a shelter home in Bagha Jatin run by NGO Sanlaap. A year down the line, the young poets have produced a collection of verses that can shock the wit out of any hard-nosed critic with their subtlety of expression and intricacy of images.

 Poetic Spaces, an exhibition held at Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre from August 13 to 27, showcased the poetry from the fringes of urbanity. It was a humbling experience for any of us ?privileged? poets. Inscribed on torn newspapers, woven chataais, broken door panels were myriad colourful brushstrokes from the lives and imaginations of these young people ? mostly in their teens and early 20s, some of whom even have to work for a living. Accompanying the poems aptly were striking black-and-white photographs by Tapomoy Guha Sarkar, capturing the poets in their daily lives. 

 An invocation by the Kalam writers, followed by seminar Beyond Anecdotes: Discovering Narratives in Silent Communities on August 20 marked the opening of the fortnight-long exhibition. It was concluded with a screening of Meera Nair?s film Salaam Bombay on August 27.

 Dhoni dhamaka

 He used to be gaped at because of his long mane. Now the flourish of his bat and success behind the wicket create more waves. Introducing Team India?s latest star, Mahendra Singh Dhoni.

 After a rain-ruined day of net practice in Bangalore, he had settled down to play Hitman on his laptop when I managed to cajole him into giving an interview. Five minutes is all he agreed to, never taking his eyes off the screen.

 Q:With kids rooting for Formula One, is cricket losing popularity in India?

 A:Cricket is more in with the masses. Plus, these games (racing) are not Indian after all.

 Q:Idol worship one day, brickbats the next... Don?t you want a more level-headed treatment from fans? 

 A:It?s this mania that proves the popularity of the game (He grins).

 Q:What about adulation of female fans?

 A:(He smiles coyly). See, you have to stay level-headed and keep your focus correct.

 Q:There are other intrusions too ? like the media glare. Me barging in now?

 A:You can?t think about all this. You do lose your freedom.

 Q:You haven?t done any brand endorsement yet. Or do you think commercials affect a player?s performance? 

 A:I will work in ads. This stuff is all handled by my agent. The shoot gets over in a day. So there?s no problem.

 Q:If there weren?t cricket for you, what would it be? 

 A:I don?t know? I started as a footballer. But I don?t think it is an option anymore.?

 Q:You are a recent addition to the team. Isn?t there any pressure to keep your place?

 A:When you play there is always pressure. But in my case, there never was any extra bit of it ? to fit in.

 Q:One hears that Sachin is rather arrogant and rude? 

 A:(The question is hardly finished when he whips his head towards me and with a defiant scowl) Never.... Who told you this? It?s utterly incorrect. All the seniors ? Sachin, Sourav, Rahul ? they were all incredibly good to me.

 Q:What catches your fancy apart from cricket? 

 A:Computer games, as you can see.

 Q:Football? 

 A:English Premier League is my favourite. I root for Rooney. 

 Beckham, Beckham, Beckham? I?m tired of him and the hype.

 By now, the promised five minutes were over. It was time for me to pack up. 

 As we see him bludgeoning the bowlers in the tri-series in Zimbabwe, I feel India after all does need a wicket-keeper who can deliver both with the gloves and the bat. So, let the hitman play on both on and off the field.

 Worth the walk

 ?Every day is a new one, but some memories will stay with us forever,? said Bharat Bhushan, field technician with the AIDS Walk for Life team. Standing outside the Indian Medical Association Hall, near Chandernagore?s beautiful river strand, he narrated an incident while he was passing through Rajasthan ? minutes after speaking to him on HIV/AIDS, a truck driver lost his life in a road accident. It was a painful reminder that life is as tenuous as precious. Each passing minute is invaluable while working on a mission.

 Born in Calcutta, Bharat grew up in Jharkhand. He had earlier worked as a journalist with a Hindi newspaper. When he moved to New Delhi, he joined Project Concern International/India, the organisation behind the cross-country AIDS walk initiative. In the initial stages of the walk, Bharat was a core walker, but later he moved on to the challenge of managing the logistics.

 The walkers entered Hooghly district on August 31 through Rishra, after two eventful days in Calcutta.

 A welcome ceremony was organised for the walkers at Uttarpara on August 31 by district officials, NGOs and students from a local school, who joined the walkers on their way to Serampore. NGOs Amitie, Manas Bangla and SAATHII had created colourful tableaus by putting up giant-sized banners on trucks, which moved along with the walkers. The walkers braved extreme humid weather on their way to Chandernagore on September 1.

 In and outside the Indian Medical Association building, the walkers and a large gathering were shown a number of HIV/AIDS-related films. Street plays were acted out by teams from Manas Bangla, Bhoruka Public Welfare Trust and Samay 1400 (a cultural troupe appointed by local NGO Universal Welfare Society).

Adda call

 Unish Kuri organised an exciting adda for its members at Jamuna Banquets on August 27. The topic for the informal talk session was free mixing of girls and boys.

 The guest speakers were telefilm director Anindita Sarbadhicary, Mouboni Sorcar, magician P.C. Sorcar Junior?s daughter, Rupam of Fossils fame and singer Pota.

 The usual energy of the Unish Kuri members made sure that the guests got little chance to speak. We look forward to more such educative and enjoyable events by Unish Kuri.

 The Central Public Works Department (CPWD)?s refusal to repair the Botanical Survey of India (BSI) office on Sudder Street is taking a toll on the books in the organisation?s library and rare exhibits in the city?s only botanical gallery.

 The central body has not carried out maintenance of the three-storeyed BSI office on the Indian Museum compound since 2000. 

 Rainwater often seeps through the roof, damaging valuable herbarium specimens in the top-floor gallery.

 The building was constructed in 1873 and handed over to the BSI by the Indian Museum authorities in 1911. 

 On July 17, 2000, the executive engineer of the Calcutta central division IV of the CPWD had informed the BSI deputy director of his organisation?s inability to carry out repair and maintenance work of the building as its name did not figure in the list of central government buildings in Calcutta.

 A senior BSI officer said on Wednesday that the building ?might collapse at any point of time? due to lack of repair.

 Deputy director of the BSI and head of office H.S. Debnath, who is in charge of the building, stated: ?It is a fact that the CPWD is not carrying out any repair or maintenance work of the building for the past five years? But our senior officials have already taken up the matter with the CPWD officials in Delhi.?

 A senior CPWD official in Calcutta refused comment on the issue.

 On July 3, 2000, a window of the BSI building had collapsed on the eastern part of the Salvation Army guesthouse. Though no one was injured, Salvation Army officials had urged the BSI authorities to carry out repair work immediately.

 However, no work could be carried out because of the CPWD stand.

 The BSI authorities also had a plan to erect an iron fence on the ground-floor balcony to keep out outsiders at night.

 ?The ground floor is easily accessible to outsiders. Several people make their way in and sleep in the balcony at night. We want to put up an iron fence, but we are prohibited from carrying out any construction work. We have to depend on the CPWD for replacing even a damaged electric bulb,? lamented another senior BSI official.

From the dead end to the turning point

 Shuttling between an actor and a producer, and changing looks with every role, ANIL KAPOOR never ceases to surprise. Sitting in his swank office in Juhu, the seasoned star tells Pratim D. Gupta about the dilemma around his new film, My Wife rsquo;s Murder, his shortest haircut in Chocolate, and the surefire hit No Entry

 ldquo;I was too self-observant, too self-centred because I was getting away with everything, rdquo; admits Anil Kapoor.

 The younger lot may spend their days doing stomach crunches at the gym but he finds it wiser to grapple with mind-crunchers, from Hitler?s autobiography to Hitchcock?s adaptations. Perhaps that?s why Fridays come and Fridays go but Anil Kapoor goes on in the turbulent industry that is Bollywood.

 Admiring a show reel from his new film, the Ram Gopal Varma co-production My Wife?s Murder, on the projection TV in his swank little office in Juhu, Kapoor got talking. ?I don?t want to mislead you into a bad film like many promos do. Even I was very sceptical when I first signed this film. Everybody apart from me is new in this film, from the director to the scriptwriter to the sound recordist. Suchitra Krishnamurthy returns after Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa. Nandana (Dev Sen) plays a ?heroine heroine? for the first time??

 So why did he say yes to the film in the first place and also agree to co-produce it? ?It was the first story that Ramu (Varma) had ever thought of, in his life. It wasn?t a copy of any Hollywood film. I wasn?t sent the DVD first and the script later. Also, I hadn?t done a Hitchcockian thriller like this before. The script had such a huge impact on me. But since everyone around was so raw, I wasn?t convinced initially. I discussed with some of my friends and only then, decided to go ahead.?

But all was not hunky-dory when the camera was set to roll. ?On the first day of shooting, I was simply petrified. I felt I had reached the end of my career. Although I have worked with new people I am usually accustomed to known names. So, I was thinking that I had come to such a stage in my career that I was having to do films like this. But on Day One itself, I was pleasantly shocked. Being their first film, everyone was giving everything they had. I was quick to realise that My Wife?s Murder would be a turning point in my career.?

 Initially planned as a two-version film ? one where Kapoor kills his screen wife (Suchitra) accidentally and one where he kills her deliberately ? My Wife?s Murder will now be released in June as one version only. The controversy around Varma?s Telugu version being shunned by women?s organisations in the south (how can a husband kill his wife intentionally, was the cry) didn?t have a role in the change of plan, said Kapoor, looking across the blinds on his window.

 ?At the edit table, I told Ramu, ?We are not that kind of people who would resort to gimmicks to cheat people. Let?s do one film only.? And I am very, very proud of the product. No matter how it does commercially, I will stand by the film.?

 Like all good producers, Kapoor had nice things to say about his cast and crew, as he flipped through the pages of My First Movie, a collection of interviews of great directors by Stephen Lowenstein. ?Suchitra was a revelation. Even after such a long hibernation she has come up with such a good performance. Nandana is, of course, very raw but she?s worked really hard and I am truly moved with her sincerity. As for Boman, I was really taken aback by his personality, commitment and integrity. I think only he has all it takes to become the next Amrish Puri. My director Jijy (Philips), what do I say ? Ramu told me even he couldn?t make the film like this.?

 But why did it take all these years for two such creative minds like Varma and Kapoor to come together? ?I always wanted to work with him after seeing Shiva. He also admitted that Mashaal had a great influence in his life. But I guess I was too self-observant, too self-centred. I wanted things to go my way because I was getting away with that. Ramu, too, wanted to stand his ground. But I must say I have learnt a lot from him. Most people in his Factory are young and even he is younger to me but at most times, you get to learn more from youngsters.?

 For someone like Anil Kapoor, who?s synonymous with great music ? Lamhe, Kishen Kanhaiya, Tezaab? ? My Wife?s Murder has no songs. ?It has a great background score by Amar Mohile but it?s songless. My first ever film, M.S. Satyu?s Kahaan Kahaan Se Guzar Gaye was songless too. We shot in Calcutta for the film and I was staying in Ballygunge. Ever since, the people in Calcutta have been very receptive to my performances. They love me there.?

 Post My Wife?s Murder, it?s time to gorge on some Chocolate. ?I love the title of the film and it?s also the shortest ever I have gone with my hair. Another new director Vivek Agnihotri. I play a mad British lawyer in the film. It also gave me the opportunity to work for the first time with such talented people like Suniel Shetty and Irrfan, and pretty looking girls like Sushma Reddy and Tanushree Datta. It?s an out-and-out commercial thriller. Total dhamaal!?

 And finally there?s brother Boney Kapoor?s No Entry. ?You can write rightaway that it?s a big hit. Sometimes you can smell success while shooting for a film. It?s a crazy comedy with two good-looking men ? Salman and Fardeen ? and a not-so-good-looking man, me.?

 Guess we need to rephrase that ? two good-looking men and a good actor.

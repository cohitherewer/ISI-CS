 Get set

 A cleansing and rejuvenating hair care routine is a must in the sultry months, says

 Himika Chaudhuri

 The phrase sweating it out doesnt get more literal than in the summer months when just stepping out of air-conditioned confines means bathing in sweat with hardly an escape. Dealing with this problem head-on is imperative even as you need to take extra care of your tresses that lack the lustre and feel oily throughout these hot months. 

 Goodlife draws up a hair care regimen for the sultry summer months.

 Trouble talk

 Many people complain of bacterial infection or rashes on the scalp during summer. Most of it is because of sweat that settles in the hair roots and doesnt allow them to breathe, says hair expert Gauri Bose of Shakamvari beauty salon.

 Pollution adds to the accumulation of dirt in the roots that accentuates the problem. Excess heat and exposure to strong sunlight throughout the day dehydrates the hair completely and makes it look dull. So both in summer and winter one needs to take extra care of the hair and take recourse to a balanced dose of clinical as well as home treatments, adds Sabina Yah of Sunflower. 

 Special care is recommended for chemically-treated hair like colouring, perming and straightening, as these already cause hair to dehydrate, which gets aggravated due to the heat. 

 Right regimen

 The treatment regimen differs from person to person depending on hair texture, age and the kind of lifestyle he or she leads. 

 Its important for an expert to assist you when you decide on hair treatment either at home or at a parlour, and the best results are obtained by following a mix of clinical and home treatment, adds Gauri. 

 Heading for a hair expert who can design a hair care regimen is what you ought to do this summer. Expert guidance also helps to break certain myths about hair care. For instance, the common notion that frequent shampooing is the remedy for oily hair, is rejected by experts. 

 Its not about how often you wash your hair, but providing the right nourishment and choosing the right shampoo thats important, points out Pooja, hair stylist of Eyecatchers.

 Tress treatment 

 Two things that summer hair care concentrates on are ensuring that the hair is cleansed well and retaining the lustre of the tresses. There are a range of treatments that one can avail of, starting with the common Hair Spa and moving on to specialised treatments available at various salons, says Sabina. 

 At Shakamvari, the most popular hair treatment during these months is the Hair Butter treatment that rids the hair of the limp and lifeless look, adds Gauri. Massaging the hair with a special butter leaves it shining and silky. Often, gadgets like the High Penetration machine, Stimulator, Scalp Hammer and Stimu-Vet are used to improve blood circulation to the scalp.

 Spa steps

 The most common in-salon tress treatment is the Hair Spa , which one should ideally undergo at least once a month during summer. Starting off with a shampoo that cleanses the hair, the next step is to use a cream mask that rejuvenates. 

 The cream is added to a chemical concentrate that differs according to hair types, adds Pooja. The next step entails applying steam on the hair to help the cream penetrate better and work intensively. The cream is finally rinsed off to leave the hair looking soft and shining.

 200 children to judge autumn fest

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Sharodotsav, or Durga puja, was never a season of cheer for 10-year-old Ishita or 12-year-old Rahul.

 While Ishita, afflicted with thalassaemia, would wistfully stare out of her window and see hordes of children joyously pass by every now and then, Rahul spent the festive days doing the usual chores as babus visited his mother at their Sonagachhi home.

 This year, however, a group of organisations are determined to make Durga puja 2005 a memorable experience for these hapless children. 

 Thanks to their efforts, around 200 children ? comprising the challenged, street children, those from red-light areas, and those suffering from diseases like haemophilia and thalassaemia ? will join a unique puja parikrama and judge pandals.

 The children, between eight and 13 years, will tour the city on Mahasashthi and select the best among 20 shortlisted pandals. The winner will be honoured with a Sharad Samman. 

 The programme ? to be coordinated by Calcutta Blood Donors Forum, with help from the city police ? will provide an opportunity for the children to spread awareness on issues they are directly linked with. 

 ?Amar pujoy khub khata-khati hoy. Ma-er kachhey onek babu ashe. Ami tader pan-biri ani. Babura majhe-majhe mare. Khub koshto hoy. Ami kono din baire jai ni. Ebar pujo dekhbo, khub moja hobe (I am so busy during the Puja. A number of babus visit my mother and I have to run their errands. They often beat me up. I never went out of this place. I am so happy that I will see so many pandals this year),? said Rahul. 

 The parikrama will start from Minerva theatre, on Utpal Dutta Sarani. The pandals the team will visit include Bagbazar Sarbojanin, Ahiritola Sarbojanin, Maniktala Chaltabagan, Mohammad Ali Park, Dum Dum Tarun Sangha, Kankurgachhi Nabodaya Palli and Darpanarayan Tagore Street.

 The children will be ferried in cars and will be provided with snacks, sweets and lunch. Medical help and other facilities will be instantly available while the group winds its way through the city.

 The pujas will be judged under a number of categories, such as idol, pandal, lighting, and the organisers? contribution to a social cause.

 ?Our aim was not merely to offer a day of joy to these children, but to endow them with a responsibility. Therefore, we have organised the Puja Sharad Samman. The children, in their way, will decide the best puja,? said Joydeb Majumder, one of those who have planned the event. 

 The guardians of the children suffering from thalassaemia and haemophilia have welcomed the idea. 

 ?I cannot take out my 12-year-old son, a thalassaemia patient, during the Puja because of the mad rush on the streets near the famous pandals,? said Ajit Mishra, secretary of the Thalassaemia Guardians Association. ?The idea of this Puja Parikrama is good. Children like my son will get an opportunity to enjoy sharodotsav like everyone else.?

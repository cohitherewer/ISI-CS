 Bose: the return of the hero

 Shyam Benegal and Sachin Khedekar were back on Netaji?s trail this Sunday, but for the small screen. Pratim D. Gupta caught up with them on the Maidan

 Calcutta boarded the time machine on Sunday afternoon at the Maidan as Shyam Benegal returned with his team to relive the Netaji dream. Bose ? The Forgotten Hero may have released some months back at the theatres but Sachin Khedekar has slipped into the famous shoes one more time for a new television series on Sahara.

 It may be the failure of the Rs 35-crore biopic at the box-office or his love for the television series format, but Shyambabu has agreed to split his film into seven one-hour episodes to be shown from January 23 (Netaji?s birthday) next year. The need for more footage to do justice to the entire life of Subhas Chandra Bose ? not just the last few years ? has got Benegal to roll his camera all over again.

 ?I am here to shoot for just one day,? Benegal smiled as he helped himself to some jhal muri. ?We have shot for six days in the studios in Mumbai and that will be enough material for the first couple of episodes for the TV series.? The first cut of Bose was three hours and 40 minutes and only at the instance of the producers had Benegal shortened the duration to some extent.

 One reason why Shyambabu took up the Sahara offer was that the first shooting schedule of his next feature, Chamki Chameli, got pushed back. While earlier the Carmen adaptation was supposed to take off on the Rajasthan deserts this November, the Urmila Matondkar, Jimmy Shergill-starrer will now start only from January 8, 2006.

 Three of the 12 songs for the musical have already been set to tune by A.R. Rahman and Ayesha Takia has been picked for another important role in the film.

 But now, it?s back to Bose. The one-day Calcutta shoot saw Benegal camping inside a specially painted tram and going up and down the Maidan-Kidderpore stretch. The sequence has Netaji recalling the day he was thrown out of a tram while protesting for women?s rights. Paul Walsh, from the British deputy high commission, and friends made up the foreign faces on the tram.

 For Khedekar, the two-day Calcutta visit was a trip down memory lane. ?It?s d?j? vu,? he laughed. ?I would love to start all over again. Playing Netaji has been the experience of a lifetime... Whether it is the whole teacher-student relationship I have had with Mr Benegal or the incredible locations we have been to or the research that we have done to do justice to the film.?

 Having gained weight for the role, Khedekar had since gone on a diet to get back to shape. So will he look a leaner Netaji in the first episode of the Sahara series? ?Not really, since I play a younger Netaji in these new sequences and can look leaner,? he reasoned. 

 On a lighter note, Khedekar still remembers his food binges at Kewpie?s. ?I am dying to go this time too,? he smiled. ?I also remember the lovely dinner Jisshu Sengupta hosted at his place. And, of course, the great Tollygunge Club, where I put up during the shooting schedule.?

 It was also a sense of d?j? vu for cinematographer Rajen Kothari, who has canned Shyambabu?s last six films, and art director Samir Chanda who has brought alive many a distant location in Calcutta and Mumbai studios.

 The only technical difference between the two Bose schedules, one shot in 2003 and the other on Sunday, is the format. While Benegal shot the film on 35 mm, he is shooting these new portions on digi-beta. ?We have converted the entire film to the digi-beta format since it will be shown on TV and are now capturing the additional sequences directly on digi-beta,? revealed Raj Pius, executive producer for Benegal.

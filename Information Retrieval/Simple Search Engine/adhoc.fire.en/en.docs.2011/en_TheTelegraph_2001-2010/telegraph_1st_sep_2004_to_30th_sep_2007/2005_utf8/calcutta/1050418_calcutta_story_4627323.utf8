 What We are Watching

Cinema - Hollywood

Million Dollar Baby

 Estranged from his daughter, boxing trainer Frankie Dunn unwillingly agrees to train dreamer Maggie Fitzgerald. Inspiring each other, the two go on to discover that they share a common spirit which transcends all the pain and loss of the past.

 Catch it at INOX (Forum): 10.15 am, 10.30 pm; INOX (City Centre): 10.50 am, 10 pm

 Why bother? After quite a few weeks in the city, the Oscar winner for Best Picture is struggling with just an average collection of 40 per cent at the multiplexes.

Polar Express

 A boy?s faith in Santa Claus is rewarded on Christmas Eve one year when he?s awakened by a long, winding steam train that pulls up in front of his house and takes him and the other children to the North Pole to meet Santa. 

 Catch it at 89 Cinemas: 10 am

 Why bother? Based upon live-action motion-capture actors and all CGI (Computer Generated Images), the film, boasting Tom Hanks?s voice, hasn?t been a big hit at the US box-office and its fate in Calcutta is also way off the mark.

Meet The Fockers

 Having allowed male nurse Greg Focker to wed his daughter, ex-CIA man Jack Byrnes and his wife now travel all the way to Detroit to meet the parent Fockers, who turn out to be weird in every sense of the term.

 Catch it at INOX (City Centre): 10.10 am

 Why bother? Slapstick, situational and plain funny, this comedy sequel works well, but the absence of a big name in the main lead has meant that it?s a strict no-no for the Jay Roach film at the Calcutta box- office.

Finding Neverland

 In the biopic set in 1904 London, author J.M. Barrie wants to bring Peter Pan to life. But the play?s premiere changes everything, from Barrie?s own life to those around him.

 Catch it at INOX (City Centre): 10.10 am; 89 Cinemas: 10.30 am

 Why bother? Sensitive performances from the lead cast including Johnny Depp, Kate Winslet and Freddie Highmore (who plays Peter) make the film an enjoyable watch. But it has not been able to sustain its initial success at the city box-office.

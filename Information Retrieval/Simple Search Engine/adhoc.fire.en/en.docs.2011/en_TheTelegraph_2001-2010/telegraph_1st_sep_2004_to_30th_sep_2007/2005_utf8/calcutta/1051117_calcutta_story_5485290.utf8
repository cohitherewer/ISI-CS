 Last book fair okay, but no pilgrims

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Bibliophiles can troop on to the Maidan for the Calcutta Book Fair one last time, but the pilgrims bound for Ganga Sagar will have to put up elsewhere from this winter.

 The army on Wednesday conveyed to the state government its ?deep concern? over defacement of the Maidan by the pilgrims and the visitors to the Book Fair.

 The government responded by promising to extend a helping hand to the army in dolling up the Maidan.

 The first step to this end would be a bar on Ganga Sagar pilgrims assembling on the Maidan from this year. Alternative arrangements are being contemplated. 

 During a meeting at Writers? Buildings, Arun Roye, general officer commanding (Bengal area), told chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb that the pilgrims hamper Maidan beautification. 

 ?The pilgrims dirty the grounds every year. Though we cannot dictate what should be done regarding this, we have told the government today that they must not allow this to continue.? Roye said.

 He added: ?The government is looking for an alternative plot for the pilgrims. It might find one by winter.?

 The venue of next year?s Book Fair was also discussed during the meeting. ?The chief minister and the chief secretary have both assured me that the next Book Fair will be the last one on the Maidan. It is a matter of mutual understanding? I am hopeful that the fair will held elsewhere subsequently,? said Roye.

 For the past year-and-a-half, the army has been pressuring the government to shift the fairs on the Maidan to other locations. After several rounds of discussions, the government agreed to the move. 

 ?The state government will not be able to ready an alternative fair ground by early next year, so they want to organise the Book Fair on the Maidan for one last time. We have agreed,? said Roye.

 The government assurance to shift the pilgrim camps has made the army hopeful that its beautification work will not be disrupted from next year. ?We are taking extra care to see that the saplings are not killed and the Maidan retains its lush green look,? signed off an army spokesman.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Backbone snag hits Net lines

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Internet users across the city serviced by Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited (VSNL) suffered through Friday as lines were down at the service provider?s end.

 Most companies, big and small, using the VSNL line to access the Internet and send and receive data, were unable to do so till late on Friday.

 Reasons offered by VSNL for the break in service, claimed some of its clients, were also inconsistent.

 ?There has been a major outage on our national backbone and, as a result, you had been facing intermittent high latency from 9.40 am to 10.10 am,? read a message from the VSNL support team around 2.15 pm. 

 It said the backbone had stabilised after that.

 Half-an-hour later, another message read: ?We are currently experiencing some network problems, which might lead to intermittent delay and packet drops. The problem is identified as a Network Issue, wherein all customers and clients are currently affected.?

 There were some problems with link outages in certain places, but it was nothing major, claimed a VSNL spokesperson in Calcutta, when contacted in the evening.

 It was only after things were, apparently, set right around 10.30 pm that a VSNL official from Mumbai admitted that service to most of Calcutta had been down throughout the day. ?Around 80 lease-line customers were among those hit,? he said.

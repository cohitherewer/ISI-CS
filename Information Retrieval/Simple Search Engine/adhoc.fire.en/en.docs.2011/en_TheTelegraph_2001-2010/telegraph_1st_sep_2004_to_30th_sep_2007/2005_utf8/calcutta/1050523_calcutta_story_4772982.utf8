Diptimoy Ghosh: What caused the Eden Gardens dispute? When is the park going to be reopened?

 The Eden Gardens is the property of the Bengal unit of the army. The garden, as well as the pagoda inside, was in bad shape, and hence, we had decided to renovate it. After the work was carried out and lights installed, we had decided to collect an entry fee from visitors, as it was becoming impossible to keep out vagrants who were dirtying the premises. The army officers however told us that we cannot sell entry tickets. By then, we had already spent quite a bit on the project and it was not feasible to reopen the facility after withdrawing the entry fee. We were told in a meeting that the defence ministry had objected to the fee. We, in turn, pointed out that there are other parks in the army area that charge entry fees. Our department has taken up the matter and is in touch with the ministry.Hopefully, the garden will reopen soon. Once that happens, we will set up some food stalls, re-do the lighting, and, if our budget permits, instal a mini toy train. We are also planing to extend the garden timings.

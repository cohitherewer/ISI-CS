 Hospital upgrade hits a hurdle

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government?s attempt to make Medical College and Hospital (MCH) a centre of excellence, comparable with All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi, appears to have hit a roadblock, at least for the time being.

 With no word from Delhi on the future of the AIIMS upgrade project, the state health department has all but given up hope of starting work even in the distant future.

 Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra said the government was yet to hear from the Centre regarding the matter, despite repeated missives.

 ?Several health ministers have come and gone, but the AIIMS upgrade project has not got underway. I do not know when things will eventually be sorted out ,? added Mishra. 

 The previous BJP-led government at the Centre had promised to upgrade at least one city hospital to the standards of AIIMS. 

 During a visit to the city a couple of years ago, then Union health minister Sushma Swaraj had announced that the ministry had decided to make six hospitals across the country as good as AIIMS. 

 The Bengal government was given the option of choosing one hospital for the implementation of the project. 

 The state government had proposed the name of MCH for the upgrade, following which the Centre had promised to sanction Rs 100 crore for the project. 

 The change of guard at the Centre subsequently put the project on hold.

 ?We have not kept quiet. We got in touch with the ministry and told them that Rs 100 crore won?t do and we need more funds for the project. But we have not received a response,? Mishra stated. 

 At MCH, none of the senior officials were aware of the status of the project. 

 ?We are completely in the dark and have no idea when the makeover will start, if at all,? said Jayshree Mitra, principal of the college.

 While the upgrade project seems to have fallen out of favour for now, the state government has found something to cheer about, after signing an MoU with KPL Foundation for setting up the city?s first private medical college at Jadavpur.

 ?The private medical college will come up on the premises of KS Roy TB Hospital. Work should start soon,? Mishra declared in the Assembly on Wednesday.

 During the session, the health minister also announced that the government had allotted about 10 acres in Rajarhat for the proposed expansion of the Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute.

 ?We had initially allotted five acres, but they asked for more and we have granted the additional land as well,? Mishra said.

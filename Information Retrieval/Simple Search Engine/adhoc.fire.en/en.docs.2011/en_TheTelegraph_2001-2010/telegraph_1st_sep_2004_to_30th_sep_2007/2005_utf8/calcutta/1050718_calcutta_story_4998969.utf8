 A course for crack pharmacists

 KINSUK BASU

 How often have you wondered about the side-effects of the medicines you have been taking regularly? Or, whether the prescribed drug schedule is right for you? If you find your doctor fumbling for the answer, relax.

 A new breed of medical pharmacists will soon be available to clarify your queries, courtesy Jadavpur University, which has started a postgraduate course in pharmacy. This is the first time such a course has been introduced in a university in eastern India.

 The aim, according to university sources, is to train budding pharmacists in determining whether a particular drug schedule is safe for the patient or whether the dosage has been prescribed in keeping with the latest findings in medical science. 

 The course content is based on the curricula followed by some of the best universities in the world, said an official. The university has also tied up with AMRI Hospitals for both theoretical and practical classes. Twelve senior doctors of the hospital will take classes regularly.

 The modalities of the training schedule were finalised on Friday, at a meeting between representatives of the university and AMRI.

 ?The students will be offered the best exposure in the industry, in keeping with our aim of achieving high levels of academic excellence,? said Rajat Bandopadhyay, registrar of Jadavpur University.

 The two-year M.Pharm course, for which eight students have already enrolled, will cover all aspects of drug interaction in all spheres, including medicine, nephrology, cardiology, ENT, surgery and intensive care. During internship, students will be allowed to check all prescriptions to ensure that the right dosage is prescribed. 

 The students will also explain the dosage to patients and monitor drug reactions, especially of critically-ill patients.

 ?Unlike in the West, we don?t find clinical pharmacologists or micro-biologists accompanying a consultant physician while he is doing the rounds. This is because we don?t have adequately trained pharmacists. The few who are available usually join medicine companies. This course will help usher in a new era,? said S.B. Purakayastha, director of AMRI Hospitals.

 For the first batch, 252 classes will be held at AMRI and the rest, at the university. Besides attending classes, the students will accompany doctors during their rounds.

 ?We have consulted Arjun Dutta, assistant professor at Howard University (USA), about the syllabi. Compared with the UK and the US, we have been lagging behind in this field for long and time has come to catch up with them,? said Arka Majumder, senior nephrologist at AMRI.

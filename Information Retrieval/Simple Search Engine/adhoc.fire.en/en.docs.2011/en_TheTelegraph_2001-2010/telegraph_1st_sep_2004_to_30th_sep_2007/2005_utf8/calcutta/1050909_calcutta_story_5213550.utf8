 Trip tips for agents 

Rein on rogue agents

 - Govt draws up code to ensure tourists are not ripped off

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 The government has drawn up a host of guidelines for tour operators and travel agents to ensure that tourists are not harassed or cheated by them.

 The tourism department has announced that anyone intending to run a travel business must fulfil certain criteria. Besides, any individual, group or company in the business will have to obtain a licence from the department.

 The rules will be notified once they receive the state cabinet?s nod, officials at Writers? Buildings said on Thursday.

 ?We want to ensure a safe and enjoyable trip for tourists,? said tourism secretary Tapan Burman. ?We want to set some criteria for travel agents and tour operators so that tourists are not cheated.?

 According to the draft rules, a travel agent or a tour operator must be a registered company (proprietorship/partnership/cooperative/private limited), have a permanent office, obtain all necessary clearances and not default in paying taxes.

 The company must also have a ?sound? bank balance, impressive communication skills and a good network among hotels. 

 At least one staff member must be a permanent employee and hold a degree or diploma in travel/hospitality management. He/she must have ?full knowledge? of tourist spots in India and the rail/flight network.

 Before leaving on a tour, the company must convey all necessary details, including the tourists? names, to the transport department. The government will also have to be informed on return.

 ?Travel agents are mushrooming in the city, as anyone can run a travel business simply by obtaining a trade licence,? pointed out secretary Burman.

 ?There is absolutely no control over the agents. You can even find them on pavements and garages, and most do not have any credential. Tourists often fall victim to their machinations. We are determined to end all these,? he asserted.

 Travel agents, he asserted, will be issued a licence by the tourism department, but only after verification of their financial and staff strength, and network.

 The licence will be optional, but will be made mandatory later.

 Those who will obtain a licence will get all administrative assistance and business support from the government. ?We will, in fact, ask tourists to opt for licenced operators,? Burman told Metro. 

 West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation managing director Souren Bhattacharya said they often received complaints fromtourists that they had been cheated by operators. 

 ?Last year, we had rescued a group from the Andamans. The tour operator had fled after checking them into a hotel,?? he recalled.

 At least five incidents of cheating came to the corporation?s notice last year. ?Many more must have gone unreported,? an official said.

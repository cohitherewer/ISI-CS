The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Bowling lane line-up

ZEESHAN JAWED

Sparkz has developed a fan following as one of the 

citys first bowling alleys. Over three years, it has added to its list of 

attractions enough to make it a hot family hangout, with much to keep everyone 

happy. Heres a low down:

Birthday: January 11, 2001.

Fun time: Noon to 11 pm.

Entry fees: Rs 30 per person. The entry ticket can be redeemed for 30 minutes 

online surfing at Junction 96.

Vital stats

Sparkz is a sprawling family entertainment centre 

situated at 35 Diamond Harbour Road, off the Majerhat bridge. Spread over 20,000 

sq ft, there is a wide variety of amusement options for the entire family in plush 

environs. Sparkz offers a winning combination of interesting games and an equally 

interesting menu. Apart from the bowling alley, there are plenty of video games, 

bumper cars and pool tables. Don Giovanni?s mans the kitchen.

Ball basics

Bowling is the anchor of this hotspot. The eight-lane 

alley attracts both kids and adults in equal measure. The lanes have lights that 

glow as the ball rolls down. When kids play, rails come up on either side of the 

wooden lane to ensure that the ball hits the pins and does not find its way into 

the gutter.

The price per game varies with the time and day of 

the week. One game on a weekday costs Rs 40 before 5 pm and Rs 50 after that. 

On weekends and holidays, each game costs Rs 65 before 5 pm and Rs 75 after dark.

Those in search of high-voltage action can pump their 

adrenaline up with the 30-odd video games. There are options like Time Crises, 

UFO Catcher and Time Buster. The kids can play Kiddie Ride, Memory Match and Big 

Bessie. There are the usual games and prize redemption schemes, where the machine 

produces a giveaway immediately after the game is over. Game tokens come for Rs 

10. Besides, there are eight bumper cars, a ride on which costs Rs 25. The same 

area can be turned into a dance floor during a party.

Munch menu

The Don Giovanni?s outlet in Sparkz dishes out pizzas, 

pastas, burgers, Chinese, Thai and Indian cuisine. There is a wide array of ice-creams 

and desserts to choose from. The prices range between Rs 75 and Rs 350.

Music mania 

The entertainment centre also has a resident DJ who 

plays on Friday evenings. The DJ can also be hired if you are having a private 

party at Sparkz.

Private pick

If you want to host a small weekend party, you can 

hire the 250-sq-ft banquet that accommodates 50 to 60 people. The hall can also 

be booked for seminars and workshops, at Rs 1,500 per hour. 

Discount deal

A membership of two-and-a-half months can be availed 

for Rs 200. This takes care of entry charges and throws in two games of bowling 

on the first visit.

Party time 

Sparkz celebrates its third birthday on January 9 

with a dance party and some great offers. The bash begins at 4 pm, with DJ Shaky 

in control at the console and model Pinky turning up the glam quotient. More exciting 

offers come with block bookings.

 Exotic Oriental lilies, crimson birds of paradise, your favourite bottle of bubbly or some oven-fresh pound cake.

 With Right Florist, an international online stop setting up shop at P76, Lake Road, the simple ways to make someone feel special have just got simpler.

 After opening brand shops in Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Vadodara and Chennai, Right Florist comes knocking on Calcutta doors. We have been in this trade for four years and though our head office is in Calcutta, we waited to find the perfect location for our exclusive outlet, says Rajesh Kumar Rathi, CEO, RightFlorist.com. 

 Right Florist is equipped to deliver flowers and gifts to over 250 locations in India and destinations in 125 countries. They also import the goodies directly to offer best rates to franchisees.

 Thats how we are able to deliver at the lowest rates. Flowers can be sent to Singapore for Rs 1,400, USA for Rs 2,000 and UK for Rs 2,600, says Rathi.

 While ordering over phone or with the click of a mouse sounds simple enough, how exactly does one go about the delivery process?

 Once you have identified the correct tie-ups, it is quite simple, actually. It is then all about networking and, at the same time, quality control. In fact, we have a separate customer service department that maintains high quality standards. And if the local florist compromises on the quality, he is bound to re-deliver at his own cost, reveals Rathi.

 Orchids, gerberas and daisies, and with plans to import Chinese lilies, tulips and more, the boutique is nothing short of a visual treat. A great collection of artificial Chinese blooms is also on display here. 

 If orders are placed before the cut-off time of 2 pm, delivery is promised the same day, but smaller-town orders might involve a grace period of two days. One can also place orders at www.rightflorist.com, online. 

 On the cards is an international experience, with promises of a theme van and dressed-up delivery boys expected to arrive at your doorstep. And all that at no extra cost.

 Mans style 

 Mens wear brand Riverdale recently unveiled its festive collection comprising a line of pristine white semi-formal shirts, kurtis and formal shirts.

 Hand-block print highlights the focal points of the white shirts ? shoulder yoke, placket, cuff, band of collar, front yoke and pockets. The motifs and patterns of the prints are inspired from the grandpas study upholstery theme, colours and grid motifs from wooden furniture.

 The kurtis are embroidered with motifs borrowed from heritage like paisleys, sun-god and florals. Fabrics like cotton and cotton blends in Indian colours and whites shape the garments. 

 The formal shirts come in stripes, diagonal stripes, checks, solids and abstract prints in pure cotton and cotton blends. The colour palette addresses the corporate and semi-formal needs. 

 The price range extends from Rs 299 to Rs 799. The collection is available with shops like Shree Value Store in Metropolis at Hiland Park, Kiron on Lindsay Street, Xpressions on Camac Street and Khadim Khazana.

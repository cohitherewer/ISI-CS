 The City Diary

 The 

high court green bench, comprising Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice Ashok 

Ganguly, on Friday directed the state planning board to file a status report within 

a fortnight on the supply of potable water in Calcutta and Howrah and elsewhere 

in the state. ?The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and the Howrah Municipal 

Corporation (HMC) will help the board prepare the comprehensive report,? the judges 

ruled. The CMC has been asked to take steps against institutions and other establishments 

that are not taking adequate measures to supply pure drinking water. The order 

followed a petition by green activist Subhas Dutta, who had alleged that the water 

supplied by the CMC and the HMC was unfit for human consumption. He submitted 

test reports of water samples collected from the two cities to substantiate his 

charges. MC lawyer Alok Ghosh argued that the authorities were supplying pure 

water to customers, but some institutions and buildings were not storing it properly. 

 Acting on a plea by Rajasthan Police, cops from Jorasanko thana arrested Rakesh Sharma at 170, Rabindra Sarani late on Thursday on a charge of cheating.

The traders waited for a month but did not get the money. They then contacted police. An officer said a team from Rajasthan will arrive soon to take Sharma in their custody.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Showcase of resurgence

 - Realtors back Crisil kudos

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Close on the heels of top billing for Calcutta?s civic body, recognition of the city?s ?resurgence? and changing perception has come from the national apex body of real estate developers. For the first time, the Confederation of Real Estate Developers? Associations of India (Credai) is doing a Calcutta special in its quarterly newsletter, the Real Estate Review.

 ?The editorial board believed that the resurgence of the city of Calcutta is a great story to be told, to provide inspiration to other Indian cities, which can take a cue from Calcutta?s turnaround to evolve their own development models and strategies,? observes Pradip Chopra, editor of the publication.

 The developers? confederation has hailed the top Crisil rating for the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) as a ?yardstick? of the citys positive growth. ?Civic bodies across the country can take a lesson or two from the CMC on how to run a municipal corporation effectively,? the newsletter says.

 Crisil has rated the CMC as A+ (stable), which reflects its ?healthy financial profile with its increasing revenue income and controlled revenue expenditure, leading to a healthy revenue surplus in 2003-04?. Credai feels the time has come to capitalise on this changing perception of the city, which had ?suffered immensely? due to its poor image in the past three decades.

 ?The Calcutta special issue is a wonderful idea and should be an effective tool to showcase the city?s new strength areas nationally and remove the wrong perception which exists in other parts of the country,? says Santosh Rungta, vice-president of Credai. He feels it?s pertinent to focus on the knowledge sector as well to tell the full story of ?the emerging Calcutta?.

 The city special issue of this quarter?s Real Estate Review also carries an interview with state IT secretary G.D. Gautama. ?Calcutta has the required environment, coupled with a variety of advantages, for the exponential growth of the IT and ITES sectors,? Gautama says in the interview.

 Jugal Khetawat, president of the Bengal chapter of the developers? forum, feels the amount of real estate development taking place in and around the city merits special mention and hence, the special issue on Calcutta is very much in order. ?A delineation of the amazing growth to a focused national audience can only dispel doubts about the city,? he adds.

 Credai, in the special issue, has suggested that the city should focus on its core strength of being the country?s ?cultural capital?. A slum rehabilitation plan, changes in certain laws for more harmonious dealings between tenants and landlords, and ?an active town-planning system? are among the bouquet of suggestions from the developers? body.

 For the past few days, Gopal Sarkar has been living without water or electricity in his house. Alleged CPM-backed goons have shut down his shop and Sarkar now does not even have money to treat his ailing five-year-old daughter, suffering from a kidney disorder.

 A trader of Rabindra Nagar, near Mahestala, Sarkar has been fighting a grim battle ever since criminals, allegedly backed by a local CPM leader, damaged his shop for refusing to hand over the plot to the leader. The vandalism took place in front of the local thana, but cops looked the other way.

 The criminals had even cut off water supply to his house.

 Thirty years ago, Sarkar had started his business in a small way. He prospered over the years and sold snacks, sweets and stationery items from his shop.

 ?I was very happy and often offered free sweets to poor children. But now, the situation is such that I don?t know how to maintain my family. I have five workers and they are all starving,? he lamented.

 Trouble erupted on July 21, when some men ransacked and damaged Sarkar?s shop. They also looted Rs 15,000. ?I ran to the police station, opposite my shop, but the cops did nothing,? he said.

 He alleged that local CPM councillor Bablu Chakraborty had been asking him to move out for a long time. He first offered Sarkar a ?paltry amount? for vacating the shop. Sarkar did not accept it.

 Chakraborty?s men then accused Sarkar of setting up the shop by encroaching on public works department (PWD) land. ?Accordingly, engineers from the PWD came and measured my shop. But they found no encroachment. The measurement was done in front of the deputy superintendent of police (industrial), South 24-Parganas,? said Sarkar.

 But as soon as the engineers left, the gang started threatening him to vacate the premises. ?One day, they vandalised my shop and abused me and my family,? he added.

 Councillor Chakraborty denied having any hand in damaging the shop. ?I have no idea about the family and have nothing to do with the criminals who had damaged the shop,? he claimed.

 Sarkar alleged that on March 24, the gang had threatened his tenants with dire consequences if the house was not vacated. ?They have left me in such a state that I don?t have any income now. The saddest part is that I cannot even afford the treatment of my five-year-old daughter Ritu, who is suffering from a kidney ailment. Her condition is now critical, but I can?t do anything,? he added.

 Mahestala municipality chairman Kali Bhandari said he would inquire into the circumstances that had led to water supply being snapped to Sarkar?s house. 

 Superintendent of South 24-Parganas police S.N. Gupta said Sarkar would get back his shop and land if the PWD had no objection. ?I will ensure that justice prevails.?

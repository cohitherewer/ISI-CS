 Musical reminiscences

 The close connections among folk songs, theatre songs and political songs have rarely been studied. A close observation of the themes and tunes of these songs clearly reveals a strong dramatic element that seeks immediate communication with the audience. The common factor shared by these musical traditions was explored and developed by master composers of the Indian People?s Theatre Association (IPTA) in the Forties and Fifties like Harindranath Chattopadhyay, Benoy Roy, Jyotirindra Maitra, Hemango Biswas (picture above), Bijon Bhattacharya and Salil Chowdhury. In a special listening session organised by Thema, rare recordings of some of their most popular compositions will be played for the listening pleasure of the audience. Songs by Chattopadhyay, Biswas and Reba Roychowdhury, along with a selection from Ketaki Dutta, the last of the great actor-singers, will illustrate the connections and unravel a rich phase of musical interactions. This will be followed by sharing reminiscences and memories of these stalwarts of the Bengali stage by people who personally knew them.

 Event: Song recordings of IPTA artistes of yesteryear

 When: Today at 6.30 pm

 Where: Thema Boighar, 46 Satish Mukherjee Road, Calcutta 26

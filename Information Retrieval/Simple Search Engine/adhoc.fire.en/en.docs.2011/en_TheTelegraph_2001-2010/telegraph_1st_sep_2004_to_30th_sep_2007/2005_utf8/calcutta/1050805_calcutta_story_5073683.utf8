 Engineering cradles rue tuition trend

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Private coaching in higher studies is common among students pursuing general courses. It?s unheard of among budding engineers.

 That was the scene a few years ago, when engineering courses were offered by only a handful of state-run institutions. But with private colleges entering the field, technical students are fast developing the habit of bunking classes and seeking private tuition.

 ?We are worried with the way students of private engineering colleges are skipping classes and taking private tuition,? a senior state government official said, while addressing a recent meeting to review the future of technical education in Bengal. 

 On being informed that scarcity of teachers in private colleges is driving the students to coaching classes, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has taken an initiative to improve the situation. He has issued necessary directives to West Bengal University of Technology (WBUT), to which over 40 private colleges are affiliated.

 Admitting to the problem, registrar Samir Bandyopadhyay said: ?We are trying to change the focus of our syllabus to minimise the scope of the students to skip classes and depend on private tuition.?

 Besides, the authorities have stepped up the examination of attendance registers in private colleges to ensure that a student attends at least 75 per cent classes each semester. They also plan to engage senior representatives of the industry as visiting faculty, hoping it will reverse the trend.

 ?Private coaching in engineering education cannot be permitted under any circumstance. We must identify those who are indulging in the practice,? said Manoj Mitra, dean of engineering and technology faculty, Jadavpur University. 

 Experts say private coaching encourages students to study select portions of the syllabus, on which questions are most likely to be set. ?The approach is dangerous. Each student is supposed to study the whole syllabus,? said a Jadavpur veteran. 

 Students of private colleges blame the WBUT curriculum for the trend. The syllabus, they claim, is heavier than what Jadavpur University and Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur, follow.

 ?As it is, our colleges do not have enough teachers. And we have to study a big syllabus. The only option is to take help from private tutors,? said a student. 

 Registrar Bandyopadhyay said: ?We have modelled our syllabus on the one followed by IITs to ensure good placement.?

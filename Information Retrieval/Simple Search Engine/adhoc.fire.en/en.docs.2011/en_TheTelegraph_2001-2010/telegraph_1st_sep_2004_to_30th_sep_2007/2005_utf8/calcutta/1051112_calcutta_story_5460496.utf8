 Snuggle in, in style

 Be it a formal black trouser, an ornate ethnic churidar, a full-bodied gypsy skirt or a flowing chiffon sari, theres one garment you can team with all of these with strikingly different results. And winter is definitely the best time to play around with the jacket.

 With city designers giving final touches to their seasons collections, this is one silhouette thats being billed as the must have for the winter wardrobe. And were not just talking about the western wardrobe here. The jacket, in its global self or the various desi avatars, is increasingly being paired with almost every kind of Indian lowers and drapes.

 The jacket technically is a western garment and was earlier teamed with trousers and formal skirts only. But with the Indianised versions like bandhgalas and sherwanis becoming popular among women, the versatility of the jacket is immense now, says designer Anamika Khanna, whose collection for the season boasts jackets in all shapes and sizes.

 Kiran Uttam Ghosh pegs the increasing popularity of the garment on international appeal. You can stylise a jacket with a sari here in Calcutta and wear the same piece in London with trousers. So, with the Calcutta woman travelling so much, the global appeal of the jacket is whats making it more and more visible in her wardrobe.

 The designer also points out that the garment has finally shed the formal feel attached to it. Previously, one would associate a jacket with formal occasions. Jackets necessarily meant dressing up. But not anymore. Now one can snuggle into a jacket anytime and anywhere... Even hang around the house in a loose one.

 GoodLife checks out the different forms and styles in which the jacket is being offered by designers around town.

 Western wow

 The list of shapes and sizes here can go on and on. Traditional double-breasted, two-buttoned, military jacket, safari, single collar, waistcoat, collarless, Mandarin collar, wrap-over?the choice is pretty wide. The length varies from the calf to the knee, mid-thigh and waist.

 Theres nothing like a well-cut, structured western jacket to lend a touch of class to your attire if you are heading for a formal evening do, says designer Sayon Mitra.

 While wool and tweed are the top picks in the fabric fare for western jackets, experimentation with raw silk, velvet silk, blends and even linen is very much visible. One can use a variety of fabrics to make jackets, as long as it is fused and lined well, says Kiran, who has used a lot of silks, cottons and mulmuls in her line.

 A new take on the garment from Preeti Jhawar is the Boho jacket. This Indo-western garment is heavily textured and embellished with a melange of patchwork, applique and prints to lend it the Bohemian look. I have paired the Boho jackets with flared skirts for the gypsy appeal, says Preeti.

 Ethnic edge

 Jackets have always been a part of Indian dressing in the form or bandhgalas and sherwanis. But that was restricted mostly to men and that too with very traditional styling. But this season these have got a major makeover and theres no end to the ways in which they are being styled, says Sayon.

 After loads of texturing, embroidery and some amount of layering as well, the bandhgalas, sherwanis, Jodhpuris and achkans acquire a vintage and ornate look. These Indianised jackets also have a very Oriental and ornate appeal. One can wear them to evening dos, as well as traditional occasions, depending on the kind of lowers you pair them with, adds Sayon.

 The fabric focus here is mainly on georgettes, crepes, raw silk and silk blends. I have developed a lot of new treated fabrics for my line of jackets this time, reveals Anamika.

 Pair pick

 You can pair jackets with just about any lower, depending on the length and style of the garment. The western ones go well with trousers (formals, denims, cigarette pants), skirts (short, pencil and straight), shorts, dresses and tights. The ethnic and fusion fare is best teamed with churidars, churi pants, flowing skirts and even saris. 

 The knee-length bandhgala style looks good when teamed with leggings or embroidered churidars and tied with a broad belt at the waist, while the ones to go with saris are those that stop mid-thigh.

 But the ethnic pairing doesnt stop at saris. Those tying the knot during the coming winter months can even top their bustiers or cholis with jackets, to go with the traditional lehnga. I have teamed lots of jackets with bridal lehngas this time, says Preeti.

 These heavily embellished ornate pieces are fitted, with high slits, and they stop just above the hip. These look very classy and fashionable, yet have a totally different effect from the typical lehnga-choli look, adds the designer.

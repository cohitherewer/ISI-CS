 From Delhi to Dhaka, a 15-year-old boy set out for a lark, at the suggestion of a Bangladeshi ?friend?. Soon, he found himself robbed and abandoned in a foreign land. 

 A month later, on Wednesday, he was back in Calcutta, in a rare case of repatriation of an Indian minor from Bangladesh.

 The youngster was brought to Calcutta by bus on Wednesday morning by an official from Aparajeyo, a Bangladesh-based NGO. He was produced before the Child Welfare Committee, Barasat, and is currently in the custody of Don Bosco Ashalayam, where he is to stay till his family is contacted in Delhi.

 According to Praajak, the Calcutta-based NGO authorised by the state to handle care and rehabilitation of trafficked boys, this is the first incident of a male Indian minor being officially repatriated. 

 Usually, it is Bangladeshi citizens who are found on Indian soil.

 Sanlaap, which handles minor girl victims of trafficking, also recalls only one case of repatriation in 2000 of an Indian girl trafficked to Bangladesh. For Aparajeyo, too, this is a ?unique case?.

 The rescued boy (whose name cannot be revealed) embarked on the unfortunate adventure on January 12, at the suggestion of the friend, identified only as Kamal. 

 ?He asked me to go to Dhaka with him, saying we would be back in five or six days,? recalls the teenager, who dropped out of school and works in a furniture store.

 The duo caught a train to Howrah and then boarded another to Bongaon. A rickshaw took them to the border, where Rs 1,000 in the greasy palm of a BSF man was passport enough to get them across the border, the boy claimed.

 Once in Dhaka, Kamal asked his friend to wait for him in an area known as Moti Jheel. 

 Kamal never came back, running away with the boy?s bag containing clothes, a watch, a pair of shoes and around Rs 1,000 in cash.

 ?He was sitting by the side of the road, crying. A lady found him, and gave him a place to sleep, before taking him to the police in the morning,? explains Abu Nayeem, the boy?s escort from Aparajeyo.

 The boy was taken to a shelter, while the relevant ministries in Dhaka and Calcutta were alerted. Within a fortnight, the paperwork was processed and the lost boy brought back to his homeland.

 The Indian authorities responded promptly to bring the boy back home as soon as possible. 

 ?This should be taken as a model for repatriation. To send back boys to Bangladesh can take over a year,? says Vedprakash Gautam of Praajak.

 Chances of similar cases arising in the future cannot be overruled. ?The border is so porous that there is a strong probability of other Indian children being found in Bangladeshi territory,? explains Roop Sen of Groupe Developpement, an NGO working with trafficked children on both sides of the border, that facilitated the repatriation. 

 Children are mostly known to move back and forth for smuggling goods into Bangladesh.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 So long, farewell

 Started as a predominantly Western classical music ensemble, The Calcutta Foundation gradually expanded its horizons to add to its repertoire various genres of music from all over the world. From Rabindrasangeet to jazz and Africano to Latino, it embraced musical and vocal talent with equal ease, ever adapting itself to changing times and trends in world music. The farewell concert of the group, hosted by Kotak, McDowell?s Signature, Open Doors, Tollygunge Club and Top Notch, promises to be an event touched with nostalgia, celebrating and remembering the musical experiences shared by them with city music lovers over the years. The evening?s programme will be all the more memorable with guest performances by Rabindrasangeet exponent Promita Mullick and Usha Uthup, who renders evergreen numbers in her own, inimitable style. Also featuring a blues-tap dance performance by tap and modern ballet fusion artist Ronnie Shambik Ghosh.

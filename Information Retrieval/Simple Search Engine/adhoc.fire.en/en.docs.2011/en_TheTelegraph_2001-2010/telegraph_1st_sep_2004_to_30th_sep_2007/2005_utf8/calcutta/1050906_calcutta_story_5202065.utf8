The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Lake Town, Salt Lake under city police

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Salt Lake and Lake Town are set to come under the jurisdiction of Calcutta Police to improve security matters.

 ?The state government has processed such a proposal. There is no justification in keeping the two urban areas under the state police,? chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb said on Monday.

 According to Deb, ?17 to 18? laws need to be amended to include new areas under Calcutta Police. ?Among these are the Calcutta Police Act and Calcutta Police Suburban Act. These formalities will take around two years,? he added.

 State home department sources said once Salt Lake ? in the spotlight for a series of criminal incidents ranging from molestation to dacoity ?comes under Calcutta Police, the township?s security net would be tightened.

 ?Manpower will increase considerably,? sources said. ?At the moment, because of lack of manpower in the state police force, an officer dealing with a law-and-order situation also has to perform investigative duties. That is not so in the case of Calcutta Police.?

 There are around 250 personnel in four police stations of Bidhannagar North, South and East, and Lake Town. In Salt Lake, there are around 200 personnel, apart from those doing VIP duty. Of the 200, around 100 are placed in police stations while the rest are deployed from reserve force and community service control.

 The most appealing aspect of period films is that the viewer can forget the moment and delve into the glory days of a time that we have all heard about but never seen. A true story, the picturisation of a well-known literary work or just pure fiction, the fact that it?s a figment of the past is what captures the imagination.

 Sometimes it needs a lavish set, occasionally it?s minimalism that works best. What attracts audiences is that it?s a tale set in an age lost, but not forgotten ? at least in history books. Often, movies bring alive the times, places and people in today?s collective conscience. For, what books can?t do, cinema can ? put images to the words. They put the present into perspective in the context of the past.

 Hollywood has long had a fascination for period films, be it cowboys, the Vietnam War or Europe in the middle ages. Sweeping sagas and dramas of epic proportions have directors all charged up and keep the turnstiles at the box-office spinning. Mel Gibson swept the Oscars with Braveheart, Gwyneth Paltrow took home the coveted best actress trophy for Shakespeare In Love, Titanic swept the audiences and the awards, The English Patient won rave reviews?

 When it comes to epics, few can match the proportions of Alexander. Oliver Stone pulled out all the stops for his dream project and came up with the Colin Farrell, Angelina Jolie and Val Kilmer-starrer at a budget of about $ 160 million. It has failed to impress critics and viewers so far, but you could make up your own mind by watching the rise and fall of one of the world?s greatest conquerors at INOX (Forum and City Centre), 89 Cinemas and Metro. 

 While war remains one of the driving forces behind period films ? World War I and II are still sources of inspiration for tinsel town ? so is literature, particularly of the Victorian kind. Not always, however, does it work like a charm.

 For some, it?s a success story many times over. Mel Gibson did a repeat performance with The Passion of the Christ, with the controversy upping the curiosity factor, while director Ang Lee shifted continents and cultures, from his adaptation of Jane Austen?s Sense and Sensibility to the Oscar-winning Chinese film Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. And Martin Scorsese followed up Gangs of New York with The Aviator. Even Shekhar Kapur earned kudos for his historically inaccurate but stunning portrayal of Elizabeth, with Cate Blanchett in the lead. He is planning a sequel to the same. 

 The Merchant-Ivory duo might have made its name with period pieces, but Mira Nair?s Vanity Fair has so far had a lukewarm response (it?s yet to come to the city), despite Hollywood beauty Reese Witherspoon in the lead. Now, even Al Pacino is donning centuries-old robes as Shylock the Jew in the screen adaptation of Shakespeare?s The Merchant of Venice, while Julia Roberts went back a few score years in Mona Lisa Smile. And who can forget Tom Cruise?s performance as a sword-wielding soldier in the action-packed The Last Samurai?

Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago 

remain two of the most popular ? and extravagant ? period films of all time. Omar 

Sharif went on to make his comeback after a long absence in Hidalgo, set 

in Arabia in the early 19th century, released in the city in December 2004. Martin 

Scorsese?s $ 100 million The Aviator, based on the life of American legend 

Howard Hughes, aviator, businessman, film-maker?, was released last month in the 

US, too, and will make its way here soon.

 The biopic starring Leonardo DiCaprio focuses on 20 years of his life, from when, as an amateur filmmaker, Hughes made Hell?s Angels, to the first and last flight of the Spruce Goose, the huge flying boat he designed and built. It touches on Hughes? love affairs with Hollywood actresses, his flight around the world in a record-breaking four days, his purchase of Trans-World Airlines and his battles with film censors.

 Scorsese has made Hollywood in the 1920s, 30s and 40s come vibrantly alive in the film in his dream project, through sets, lights, colours and especially with actresses such as Kate Beckinsale and Cate Blanchett playing the likes of Ava Gardner and Audrey Hepburn. 

 And then there?s Phantom of the Opera, due to be released later this month, the screen adaptation of the most successful stage production of all time. Though a depressing tale of obsession, the musical is a reflection of its times, from the dark side (the phantom) to the light (young singer Christine, the object of the phantom?s obsession).

 Although Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is largely digitally done and is a sci-fi film, it?s set in the early part of the last century and is rakishly portrayed by Jude Law, Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow.

 Whether you like this genre or not, don?t write off period films just yet. After all, India?s third Oscar nomination, Lagaan, wasn?t from the pages of history but was set against the age-old backdrop of the British Raj.

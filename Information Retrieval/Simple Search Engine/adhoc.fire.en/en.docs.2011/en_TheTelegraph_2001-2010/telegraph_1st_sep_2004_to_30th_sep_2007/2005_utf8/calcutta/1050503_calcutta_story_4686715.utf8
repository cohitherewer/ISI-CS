The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Flaw flak for JU probe report

 JULIUS GOMES

 The crisis on the Jadavpur University campus would not have been precipitated if the executive council had taken note of the ?irregularities? and ?infirmities? in the inquiry commission?s report, on the basis of which it had recommended the expulsion of five senior students.

 This was one of the points dominating the students? reply to the show-cause notice, a copy of which is with Metro.

 The reply further states how the commission had not substantiated any of the alleged offences that the five were charged with.

 ?The executive council failed to make full-fledged consideration of the said report of the Professor Amit Sen enquiry commission and decided upon it without any application of mind to it. As a consequence, the executive council failed to detect various irregularities, inconsistencies, incongruities, and infirmities of the report for which the entire proceeding of the executive council was vitiated,? the reply to the registrar reads.

 A total of 32 flaws in the commission?s report have been highlighted, alleging the commission?s failure to probe the September 2003 varsity violence without bias.

 The letter states: ?It is strange that the commission without reference to the individual depositions made by witnesses and considering them summarily proceeded to establish that ?students belonging to Fetsu were wholly and squarely responsible for this gherao? However,? none of the witnesses? on the basis of whose deposition the commission drew its conclusion? mentioned the name of the union i.e. Fetsu as being responsible ? and such conclusion is obviously unwarranted?? (see graphic)

 It also points out that one of the witnesses had stated in his deposition that when the controller of examinations and a lady teacher of the philosophy department had emerged from the meeting (that had been gheraoed), they had not been obstructed by the students. This was contrary to the allegation that both had been verbally abused and then manhandled.

 ?We will place the letters before the executive council for it to decide when it meets next, but the date has not been fixed yet,? registrar Rajat Bandyopadhyay said on Monday.

 The student count in Jadavpur University?s examination halls was back to zero on both campuses.

 In the wake of repeated appeals by the authorities and the Jadavpur University Teachers? Association (JUTA) to scale down the agitation, faculty of engineering and technology students? union (Fetsu) representatives appealed to all final-year students to appear for the semester exams.

 ?We make this appeal symbolically to show that we earnestly want the impasse to end at the earliest. We want the authorities to understand that our determination to achieve our demands remains undiluted,? said Amit Chakraborty, general secretary of Fetsu.

 ?The authorities have shown no sympathy towards the careers of the senior students, but we cannot be apathetic,? he added.

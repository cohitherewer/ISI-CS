 Feminine focus

 Women have served as a source of inspiration to artists the world over. Depicted as creator, nurturer or even destroyer, the female figure in art still remains an eternal enigma. Nari ? My Inspiration, the ongoing exhibition of paintings by Rana Roy, finds women once again holding centrestage on the artist?s canvas. Seen through his eyes, women have been portrayed in all their human complexities; in exotic shades of aquamarine, cobalt blue, mauve, yellow and green, which wrap them in an aura of charm and mystery. Capturing their hopes, aspirations and innermost desires, Roy succeeds in holding the viewer?s attention through the expressive features of his characters, who speak eloquently with their innocent, beckoning eyes. An interesting aspect about his characterisations is that though his women are traditional, they also appear to be ready to accept a modern way of life.

 From plush restaurants on Park Street to Chinese chomp in Tangra, nobody seems to say no to noodles. But the ready-to-eat variety of noodles still leaves something to be desired in a city sold on chilli chicken-chowmein.

 Now, theres good news drifting in from the north-east ? WAI WAI noodles are going big with their Calcutta plans.

 WAI WAI is the leader in the instant noodles market in the north-eastern region of India. The annual turnover in that area is more than Rs 50 crore, says R.K. Gupta, vice president (commercial), Chaudhory Group (Foods) India Ltd, that launched the brand in India 10 years ago.

 Though WAI WAI is being sold in Calcutta for more than six years now, the focus was always limited to the north-east. Now, we are trying to strengthen our position in Calcutta; it would be our launch pad for the eastern region because of its connectivity and infrastructure, adds Gupta, in town to push the brand being positioned as value-added instant noodles that can even be had directly from the pack.

 According to Gupta, the instant noodles market is growing in the state, especially in Calcutta, and is poised at Rs 30 crore. Though noodles are very popular in Calcutta, the (ready-to-eat) brown category is virtually absent. We want to target that virgin segment, explained Gupta.

 WAI WAI is available in two categories: white and brown. The white variety is similar to other noodle brands available in the market. The brown category, launched in Calcutta last month, can be eaten directly from the pack with garnishing or as a soup by pouring in hot water or as noodles bhel by mixing with onions, tomatoes and lemon, revealed Gupta.

 WAI WAI Brown is priced at Rs 10 per pack and WAI WAI White at Rs 11 per pack. At present, the noodles are sourced from Nepal, but by January 2006 two state-of-the-art manufacturing units in Sikkim and Uttaranchal would start producing noodles for the Indian market. Next month, we are also launching Alooz, the potato chips brand, in Calcutta, said Gupta.

 To popularise the concept of open-and-munch noodles, the company is setting up vending machines at strategic points in the coming months.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Magical tour for muggles

 Managed to get through the past 10 years 

 or so without reading any of Harry Potter?s escapades? If 

 you are this strange strain of muggle, get smart before the 

 sixth instalment comes calling. Metro on Sunday gives 

 you a glossary of sorts to bring you up to speed before 10 

 am, July 16

 Book 

 basics

 There have been five books in 

 the series so far: Harry Potter and the Philosopher?s 

 Stone, Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban, 

 Goblet of Fire and The Order of the Phoenix. 

 The sixth ? Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince 

 ? is to hit the eagerly-awaiting shelves next Saturday morning.

 who?s who

 Harry Potter: He started 

 out sweet, now he is angry, but so would you be if the fate 

 of the magical world rested on your 15-year-old shoulders. 

 He can?t get away from his destiny, which seems to be inseparably 

 linked with that of Lord Voldemort, who killed Harry?s parents 

 James and Lily in a bid to murder him when he was only an 

 infant, believing the boy was prophesied to kill him.

 But the evil wizard failed, as 

 Harry gained protection when his mother sacrificed her own 

 life to save his, acting as a counter-curse. The attack 

 left Harry?s forehead famously scarred in the shape of a 

 lightning bolt, an injury that throbs even now when Voldemort?s 

 powers are on the rise. Since then, there have been numerous 

 confrontations between the two, and Harry has had some close 

 shaves. The battle that started in Book V will only get 

 more intense in the last two chapters of the seven-book 

 series.

 Voldemort: The Dark Lord, 

 Tom Riddle, He who must not be named? Whatever you want 

 to call him, Lord Voldemort is the most dastardly villain 

 the magical world has ever seen. And he has had it out for 

 Harry since he was just a baby. The vicious vendetta worsened 

 when the fatal Avara Kedavra curse he tried to use on Harry 

 backfired, nearly killing himself.

 Harry too is no mood to let bygones 

 be bygones. Voldemort killed his parents, hurt almost everyone 

 he knows and intends to destroy all that is good in a world 

 he has only just discovered. But the Dark Lord?s powers 

 are growing and the second war with the Death Eaters ? Voldemort?s 

 dark supporters ? had already begun by the end of Book V.

 Ron Weasley: Ron?s family 

 almost adopts Harry, one of his closest pals at school since 

 day one. Harry?s 15-year-old classmate hails from a rambunctious 

 family of wizards and one young witch, and always sticks 

 by him through the tough times. Though they have had their 

 share of spats, without Ron?s loyal support, it is unlikely 

 that Harry would have made it to HPB (Book VI) 

 alive.

 Hermione Granger: She is 

 the brightest, most hard-working student in class and is 

 fast friends with Harry and Ron. The 16-year-old muggle-born 

 girl may be a know-it-all, but she always pulls through 

 with the right spells and is wise to just what kind of magic 

 will work on which kind of villain. There are definite stirrings 

 of romance between her and Ron.

 Albus Dumbledore: At least 

 150 years old, Dumbledore is still the most powerful wizard 

 of his time. He is also the headmaster of Hogwarts, where 

 Harry and gang are being educated. He has become something 

 of a mentor to Harry, keeping him on track. He also started 

 the Order of the Phoenix in the 1970s in order to keep Voldemort 

 in check, a group that is now back in action.

 Sirius Black: One of Harry?s 

 father?s best friends, Sirius was wrongly implicated in 

 a mass murder when the dark forces were at their peak. Thought 

 to have betrayed James Potter, leading to his death, he 

 was imprisoned at the dreaded Azkaban. He escaped after 

 12 years, just in time to play crucial roles in Books III, 

 IV and V. Just when Harry and he became very close, and 

 the young orphaned boy thought he had finally found something 

 akin to a father, Sirius is killed in battle (Book V).

 Hagrid: The half-giant 

 was once a student at Hogwarts, but a series of unfortunate 

 events ended that. Now he is gamekeeper, sometimes Care 

 of Magical Creatures teacher, and always Harry?s pal, who 

 quite often gets himself, and those around him, in a fix.

 The Dursleys: Aunt Petunia 

 (Lily Potter?s sister) and Uncle Vernon didn?t want to take 

 Harry in after his parents were killed but were compelled 

 to by Dumbledore. The result was a decade of near torture 

 and misery ? much of it at the pudgy hands of insufferable 

 cousin Dudley ? till Hogwart?s came calling in Book I.

 Severus Snape: Is he evil 

 or isn?t he? He is no fan of Harry, though he has come to 

 his aid in the past in the most unexpected ways. The professor 

 with a dark history as a Death Eater is also in charge of 

 Slytherin house, which has an eerie habit of producing the 

 darkest of wizards and witches around ? including Voldemort.

 Draco Malfoy: Harry?s bully 

 classmate, this slimy character is Snape?s understudy of 

 sorts. The Slytherin boy?s father Lucius is one of Voldemort?s 

 followers and is now in jail, thanks to Harry. The enduring 

 rivalry can only get worse.

 what?s what 

 Hogwarts School of Witchcraft 

 and Wizardry: This premier Scottish institution is one 

 of the schools to go to if you are a young witch or wizard. 

 Most students get there by taking a train from Platform 

 Nine and Three Quarters at King?s Cross station.

 Once there, students are divided 

 into four houses ? Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff and 

 Ravenclaw ? much like any other school, except, here the 

 selection is done by the Sorting Hat, which best assesses 

 kids? strengths and weaknesses.

 This crucial decision determines 

 where students will live, at which table they eat, with 

 whom they play sport, amongst a host of other things. The 

 competition is fierce, and of course Harry?s house Gryffindor 

 is on top of the ratings, with Slytherin snapping at its 

 heels.

 Privet Drive: This is where 

 Harry is forced to live during the summers with the Dursleys.

 Diagon Alley: The bustling 

 marketplace for all things magical, Harry and the rest of 

 the Hogwarts team pay regular visits to this lane to buy 

 books, broomsticks, wands and all other magical necessities 

 and luxuries.

 Quidditch: This is a key 

 element in Harry?s world. The sport can best be described 

 as a cross between American football and basketball, except 

 the whole business is conducted on broomsticks, with seven 

 players to a team. There is a big ball called the quaffle, 

 two smaller bludgers and the critical snitch, a tiny golden 

 ball that flies around at rocket speed. It is the seeker?s 

 job to catch it, win points and bring the game to an end. 

 Harry is the youngest seeker Hogwarts has seen in a century. 

 And he is very, very good at it.

 Muggle: Ordinary folk, 

 like you and me, without magical powers of any kind.

 Mudblood: Powers are not 

 necessarily hereditary. The Weasley family, for instance, 

 is full of magically gifted people (purebloods), and Harry?s 

 parents were powerful in their time, but Hermione?s parents 

 are muggles. In the caste system (yes, sadly, the magical 

 world has one too), half-bloods ? a mix of muggle and magical 

 stock also known as mudbloods ? are considered by some to 

 be inferior.

 Ministry of Magic: In charge 

 of administration of the magical world, just like any government.

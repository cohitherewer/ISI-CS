 BY DAY

 Pedro Almodovar?s women have the 

 last say in a man?s world. Be it Marina in Tie Me up! 

 Tie Me Down! or Elena and Clara in Live Flesh, 

 Tina in The Law of Desire or Manuela in All About 

 My Mother. They are all strong-willed women with conviction 

 in themselves, just like Pedro?s mother. 

 The 10-film retrospective on the 

 phenomenal Spanish director, at the 11th Calcutta Film Festival, 

 is just a glimpse into a mind that blends issues from gender 

 to nationality.

 ?Pedro has always been interested 

 in Spanish society. His films are representative of post-Franco 

 Spain, when the country saw democracy and prosperity,? said 

 the film-maker?s younger brother Augustin Almodovar, in 

 town to attend the festival.

 The brothers had teamed up in 

 the Eighties, with Pedro riding the creative crest and Augustin 

 funding the ride.

 During those days, Pedro would 

 work for a telephone company and write scripts for comics 

 and underground journals. 

 After debuting with Matador 

 in 1986, Pedro touched upon contemporary Spanish life 

 with all its idiosyncrasies ? from football to rock music, 

 transexuality to drug-addiction ? to create a series of 

 thought-provoking films.

 Pedro works on various plots and 

 combines them to create an unusual dramatic effect. ?He 

 has a theory ? that films should be better than the scripts 

 ? and he has always stuck to it. Our shooting style is very 

 simple. We start shooting the beginning of the story and 

 slowly get to the end,? smiles Augustin.

 ?But in the beginning it was very 

 difficult because I didn?t have any money. We made our first 

 film with the help of friends ? Now the government is helping 

 the Spanish film industry by giving subsidies. Around 130 

 films are being made in Spain a year,? adds Augustin, who 

 rues the fact that Hollywood films comprise 80 per cent 

 of the screenings in his country.

 AT NIGHT

 What: The Calcutta Film 

 Festival party hosted by Harshvardhan and Madhu Neotia.

 Where: Swabhumi on Monday 

 night.

 The crooner: Rahul Vaidya, 

 runners-up, Indian Idol.

 For a good two hours, the singer 

 belted out some evergreen and some current Bollywood numbers. 

 Chhoo kar mere man ko, Jaane ja, Kajra 

 Re, Aashiq banaya... 

 Star power: Leading the 

 name-game brigade was civil aviation minister Praful Patel. 

 But all eyes were on the Tolly stars. Late into the party, 

 Rupa Ganguly hit the dance floor with Tollywood hero Jeet, 

 sending photographers into quite a tizzy with her Kajra 

 Re act. Jeet, however, kept his Shubhodrishti moves 

 to the minimum and chose to charm the star-struck audience 

 with his smile.

 Actress June, normally so keen 

 to take to the dance floor, maintained quite a low profile. 

 Sporting her latest hairdo, she restricted herself to smiles, 

 conversations and light bites. Also spotted were Arjun Chakraborty 

 with wife Nilanjana, Pallavi Chatterjee, Sayantani, Arindam 

 Sil, Bikram Ghosh and Jaya Seal Ghosh. Big names in fashion 

 like Sabyasachi Mukherjee, Kiran Uttam Ghosh and Sharbari 

 Dutta also dropped in.

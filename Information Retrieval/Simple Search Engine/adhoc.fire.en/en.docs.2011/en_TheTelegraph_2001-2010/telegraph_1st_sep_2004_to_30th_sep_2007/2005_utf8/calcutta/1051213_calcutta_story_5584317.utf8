 Surgery surge to replace joints

 A STAFF REPORTER

 From 10 cases in 1994 to 300 this year ? more and more Calcuttans are opting for joint replacement surgeries and the doctors blame poor lifestyle and increasing pollution for the trend. 

 ?Knee-replacement surgeries are more common than hip replacements. The ratio at the moment is 3:1,? said Prabir Kumar Banerji, head of orthopaedics, Peerless Hospital and BK Roy Research Centre.

 With the number of joint-replacement surgeries on the way up in the city, the hospitals are trying to find out the reasons. Apollo Gleneagles and Peerless recently held workshops-cum-seminars to throw light on the issue.

 Hugh U. Cameron, a well-known orthopaedic surgeon from Canada who attended the programme at Peerless, said: ?The rate of joint failure could be higher in the West, but such cases are rising in India, particularly because of its growing economy.? 

 The trend is more pronounced in the urban areas. According to doctors, the reasons could be many.

 ?One factor could be that there is an increase in awareness about joint replacement surgeries. Besides, change in lifestyle and pollution could be weakening the body gradually. Since the life expectancy has increased from 55 to 75, the possibility of wear and tear of joints has also gone up,? said Banerji. 

 Cameron singled out the problem of excess body weight, which he felt was an area of concern in India. 

 To collate data on the trend and nature of joint replacement surgeries in India, the Indian Society of Hip and Knee Surgeries has recently been set up.

 However, redo surgeries, performed only if there is a problem with the initial surgery, is still at a nascent stage in India. ?Since replacement surgeries started in India only about a decade back, there is still time for revision cases to surface,? explained Banerji. 

 Cameron feels patients could be delaying redo surgeries because of the expenses.

 Muted shades like beige and cream on the walls, tiled or polished wood floors, soft leather couches and snug beanbags, coloured candles and tall lamps. Soft rock, hip-hop or trance music and an impressive array of alcohol?

 Lounging is in with a vengeance, as is evident from one or the other new-age relaxed rendezvous opening up every other day. And the traditional eating houses in the city ? from Amber to Bar-B-Q, Oasis to Floriana ? are eager to swim with the tide and reinvent to cling on to foodie footfall.

 Numerous variations of the lounge or resto-bar concept are being tried out to help patrons slip into chill-out mode.

 ?A large section of our younger clientele prefers to have a quiet drink in cosy comfort, with soothing music and soft lighting, and there aren?t too many places on Park Street that fit the bill. So, we decided to give them the option,? says Rajiv Kothari of Bar-B-Q.

 The popular eating house on Park Street has launched Hideout, a 32-seater lounge bar on the mezzanine floor on the way up to its speciality Chinese restaurant Flavours of China.

 It was neighbouring Oasis that took the plunge on Park Street first, last August, with its Lounge 33 on the mezzanine level and has now added the second non-smoking section. Not a regular lounge by any stretch of imagination, just a relaxed-seating format, with soft music and minimalist d?cor, it has nonetheless triggered ?a 15 per cent jump in turnover?, maintains owner Pratap Daryanani.

 ?In today?s fiercely competitive scenario, you have to be a tad different and offer that something extra. The continental brunch menu, in-between snacks, exclusive cocktails, are all efforts towards value-addition,? Daryanani adds.

 And convention is making way for innovation everywhere, as the oldies try their hand at wooing a hip and younger throng.

 Amber, one of the oldest names in the city?s restaurant business, is readying its resto-bar for a March rollout ? yes, on Waterloo Street.

 ?With so many snazzy options all over town, you can take your clientele for granted at your own peril. For long, we have stuck to the same format, with a great degree of success, but it?s time to move on,? admits director Sanjay Khullar.

 The fabled city centre address is embracing the ?TGIF concept for a niche clientele? on its redesigned second floor, with peppy orange-and-blue interiors and a gleaming granite bar counter.

 ?We would like to offer a package where one can spend a good two-three hours, over either finger food or pre-plated meals, with the choicest kebab platters and a fantastic range of desserts and liquor in an elegant, unhurried ambience,? explains Khullar.

 At Floriana, on Russell Street, the circular bar has been converted into Sam?s Pub, a low-seating arrangement with a small dance floor, which rocks after 8 pm, with the middle-aged office crowd making way for a GenX mix.

 ?Today?s youngsters are always seeking something different and Sam?s gives them another option to let their hair down,? says owner Charles Mantosh, reporting a 50 per cent jump in bar turnover since the makeover last December.

 Kothari, too, hopes to cash in with ?at least a 15 per cent? growth in turnover as long as the ?lounge bar fad lasts?.

 The target audience for all is getting younger by the year. And with good reason: the average age of the home-bound officegoer stopping over for a sip and bite has dropped from the 40-plus to the 25-35 bracket.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Designer headgear for police march 

 SMITA ROY CHOWDHURY

 A new headgear awaits the police armed forces on January 26

 This Republic Day, designer gear is going to the head of the armed forces of Calcutta Police. For, they will be seen sporting headgear in shades of jungle green and maroon. A far cry from the age-old khaki motif during the march past, this would mark the debut of the new ceremonial turban especially crafted by men?s wear designer Sharbari Datta.

 Sharbari, in fact, has designs on the entire uniform of the armed forces personnel. But while the new headgear is sure to adorn heads on special occasions starting January 26, the rest of the attire awaits approval from the police commissioner.

 ?Sharbari Datta has submitted a design for the uniform of the armed forces. We are examining it and are yet to decide whether we can introduce the change,? police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee told Metro.

 Joint commissioner of armed forces Zulfikar Hassan added: ?We had requested her to make some changes to the uniform. She has done a great job, but police have certain dress strictures and we have to see whether the new design adheres to those. The commissioner will decide whether we will change the existing uniform and introduce her designs.?

 The new headgear, clarified Hassan, had already been used once on an experimental basis for a change of guard and would be ?officially worn for special ceremonies and parades? from this Republic Day.

 Sharbari has changed the colour of the khaki uniform to grey, made the silhouette more body-hugging and changed the positioning of the monogram. ?The uniform was very loose, so I felt it should be more shapely. I have also changed the colour of the traditional headgear, which looks like a combination of a turban and a cap,? said the designer.

 The change of the uniform colour could prove too radical a makeover. ?The designer feels that grey suits our weather more than khaki and hence she has suggested the change of colour,? said Hassan.

 Yet, Calcutta Police is not closed to the idea of changing its stripes. ?Our uniforms have been changing over the years and it has seen around seven or eight transformations till now. In fact, Calcutta Police was the first in the country to introduce khaki in the 1950s,? said Hassan.

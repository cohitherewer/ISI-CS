The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Comfort call with lounge line

 With the latest shift 

 in the citys party preference, casual chic is the new 

 mens wear mantra. Zeeshan Jawed checks out the 

 options available at city stores

 Move over disc-hopping and floor-jamming, 

 lounging is the latest concept to hit the nightlife of laid-back 

 Calcutta. Jostling on the dance floor with strangers at 

 a nightclub has given way to chilling out with friends at 

 a lounge of one?s choice. And like many lifestyle changes, 

 this shift in preference of the party people has given rise 

 to a new genre of clothing ? lounge wear.

 The concept is still young to 

 the city, but designers and stores have been quick to react 

 to this new wardrobe requirement. And for once, they have 

 spared as much thought for the men as for the women. So, 

 flashy party shirts with broad collars and floral prints 

 in electric colours have been replaced by sober yet stylish 

 alternatives.

 Says designer Medhavani Khaitan 

 who has launched a range of lounge shirts for men recently: 

 ?Lounge wear is not exactly casual wear. These are shirts 

 that one can wear to a cocktail dinner as well as an evening 

 out with friends. The comfort factor is of primary importance.?

 For the young brigade, she recommends 

 experimentation with vibrant colours and some surface ornamentation, 

 while the not-so-young can go for solid colours with elegant 

 cuts. 

 Goodlife checks out the 

 varieties on offer at stores around town.

 Fabric focus

 Polynosic, crepes, cottons, linen 

 and blends are the primary picks of fabric for lounge shirts. 

 Apart from the lustre of polynosic, which obviously makes 

 it a good bet for evening wear, the other advantage is its 

 anti-wrinkle property. They are available with most stores 

 these days and the palette is truly vibrant with pinks, 

 reds, blues, yellows and purples aplenty. The Provogue outlets 

 at City Centre and Forum have a wide range of these shirts. 

 Blackberrys and Spykar Jeans in Forum also offer some good 

 options. The prices range between Rs 1,095 and Rs 1,395.

 Shirts in cotton and linen or 

 blends of linen and silk or cotton and silk are the other 

 favourites in this segment. These are mostly mid-length 

 shirts and are often slitted on the sides. The prices start 

 at Rs 995.

 Design diary

 This is one segment that gives 

 men?s wear designers a chance to innovate with embellishments. 

 A line of full-sleeve mid-length party shirts from Next 

 are adorned with stitches running all over. The crushed 

 polyester variety from Espirit is another show-stealer. 

 ?These are anti-wrinkle shirts and hence are ideal for lounging. 

 They are very comfortable and maintenance is quite easy. 

 People have lapped up these shirts,? says Bharti Harlalka 

 of Just Casuals. Her two outlets in City Centre and 40/8 

 Ballygunge Circular Road stock both the brands. 

 Georgette shirts in solid colours 

 with self designs and camouflage cotton shirts with large 

 prints are the top draws at the Spykar Jeans outlet in Forum. 

 The store also offers cotton and denim blend shirts. For 

 the more sober buyer, the shop offers evening wear shirts 

 with pearl buttons and various kinds of checks. These are 

 available in blue, black and chocolate brown. 

 Linen luxury

 For those wanting to make a casual 

 chic statement, linen kurtis would be good buys. 

 These can be teamed with casual trousers. Available in pure 

 linen and blend of linen and cotton, these are high on the 

 comfort quotient. The prices start at Rs 440. 

 Party shirts in linen also seem 

 to be a great hit with the men. ?Linen shirts with straight 

 and diagonal stripes have been selling very well for quite 

 sometime,? says Amit Khera, manager of Cotton World in Forum. 

 The shirts here come in lavender, pale blue, navy blue and 

 red. The prices start from Rs 590.

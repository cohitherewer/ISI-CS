 - IT pluses for party hosts: They?re young, rarely unruly and big spenders

 Nightclubs are wooing the BPO and IT company crowd for year-end bashes

 Through the year, night and day, they have helped boost employment figures and the image of the city. On the last night of the year, they will help the New Year?s Eve parties in town to be crowded and clean.

 Team members of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s blue-eyed information technology (IT) brigade in Sector V, Salt Lake, are the most wanted party people in the countdown to December 31. With club bashes and private parties threatening to steal the nightclub thunder on the big night, star hotels in the heart of the city are wooing Sector V with a vengeance to ensure heavy footfall and hassle-free fun.

 ?To keep the business going, we must have more and more people coming out and partying. The crowd in BPOs and IT companies is a young lot, matching the profile of our club. Our sales team has been meeting the IT and BPO bosses on a one-on-one basis to market our New Year?s Eve party concepts. We have got many bulk bookings,? says Vinay Jaiswal of Hotel Hindusthan International, where Underground and a Poolside party are the big draws.

 The spending power and profile of Team IT are big pluses for their popularity among party hosts. ?The crowd from Sector V is the best-behaved lot. They hardly cross their limits and never create problems for the nightclub authorities. By hosting them, we not only generate revenue but also crowd out unruly elements,? says Hem Dhillon, director, B.E.D, which has bulk bookings from Sector V companies on New Year?s Eve.

 From free entry to complimentary drinks and snacks to one bash on the house for a particular number of parties in a month, the nightclubs are turning it on for the tech team.

 And work hard but party harder seems to be the motto of IT companies. ?We prefer to host our parties at nightclubs mainly due to the age group of our employees, which ranges from the early 20s to the mid-30s. Quite a few of them visit the nightclubs on a regular basis. Their work is so high stress that the concept gels with everyone as a rule,? feels Heena Ahmed, manager, human resources, BNKe Solutions.

 Factors taken into account by the companies when choosing a specific party place are space, snacks, music and security. ?Comfort is the key. The place has to accommodate a large number of our employees comfortably... While no one wants a full-course meal at a nightclub, the selection of snacks has to be done quite carefully. The music plays an equally important role, especially the DJ,? adds Ahmed.

 Night spots that feature prominently on Sector V?s places-to-party list are B.E.D, Fusion and Red Lounge, with new places always on the to-explore list.

 ?The IT people are big spenders. On a night, the average billing can even touch Rs 4,000 per person,? says Kanishka Mazumdar, CEO, Sourav?s.

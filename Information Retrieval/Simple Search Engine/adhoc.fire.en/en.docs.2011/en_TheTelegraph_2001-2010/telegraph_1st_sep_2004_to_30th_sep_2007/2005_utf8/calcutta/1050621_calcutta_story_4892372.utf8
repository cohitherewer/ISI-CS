 It offers a livelihood to millions, is a reservoir of knowledge for people with a passion for research, and for some, it is a platform for adventure and sport. The depths of the sea mean different things to diverse sets of people. 

 Keeping this gamut of interests in mind, the Sea Explorers? Institute is conducting a host of programmes for people fascinated with the sea and the river. 

 ?Our country has a vast coastline and the institute was set up in 1986 with the objective of inculcating the spirit of adventure and maritime research,? said Sheuli Chatterjee, general secretary of the city-based voluntary organisation. 

 According to her, the institute, which runs with funding from both the Central and the state governments, is the ?only one of its kind? in the country that conducts research, organises seminars, workshops and expeditions and offers training courses to increase awareness on the waterworld. 

 From basic courses in marine and watersports awareness for schoolchildren to advanced programmes on commercial diving ? the institute has a mix of modules for sea and river enthusiasts. 

 ?Recently, we have launched an eight-week programme on self-contained under-water breathing apparatus (scuba) diving and it is gaining popularity,? said Chatterjee. 

 Trained scuba divers, armed with air cylinder, fins, regulators, mouthpiece and goggles, can spend around 45 minutes under water at a depth of about 60 ft. The institute has imported a range of state-of-the-art gear to roll out the programme. 

 The training sessions for scuba, priced at Rs 20,000, and 10-week commercial diving, priced at Rs 30,000, include cutting, de-silting and air-lifting, and are held at the institute?s facility near Subhas Sarobar, in Beleghata, besides the centre at Outram Ghat. 

 The Subhas Sarobar set-up includes a 10-m-deep training tank, swimming pool and classrooms. ?We also expose the trainees to real-life situations by organising a few diving sessions in the Hooghly,? said A.K. Seal, senior faculty at the institute. 

 According to him, the scope in commercial diving is on the rise as companies ? from port trusts to engineering firms ? are now looking for experienced divers.

 ?Commercial divers are also hired on specific projects,? said Deepak Sarkar, in-charge of practical training at the institute. Whenever there is an emergency, the experienced diver?s services are sought by the police and port authorities.

 Recognising this trend, the institute is in the process of modifying its offerings and making the courses more market friendly. ?We have realised that the courses should be geared to industry needs,? agreed Chatterjee. According to her, the demand for the institute?s environment analyst (water and soil) programme has increased, since it guarantees 100 per cent placement. 

 The institute is also keen to fulfil its basic objective of making people aware of the riches of the sea and river and imparting skills for manoeuvring in sea and river for the purpose of sport, expedition and research, besides churning out professionals. 

 ?Our dream is to branch out and make it a national institute. So, we want higher involvement from members of the young generation,? signed off Chatterjee.

 Fair focus on biotech

 A STAFF REPORTER

 After opening a centre for carrying out research in biotechnology, Calcutta University (CU) is set to organise a career fair with the subject as the theme.

 The fair ? the first of its kind at the university ? will be held from June 10 to June 12. Synergy and Network, a city-based organisation engaged in organising career fairs to help students take up subjects that provide job opportunities, will partner CU. 

 ?The demand to study biotechnology courses is increasing every year. A pavilion will be dedicated to the subject at the fair. We are happy to hold the event jointly with CU, which has the expertise to offer the right guidance to students,? affirmed M. Joshi, director, Synergy and Network.

 The centre for conducting study and research in biotechnology at the university was inaugurated by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in March. 

 Synergy and Network has held two major career fairs in the past couple of years, in collaboration with the state technical education department. The venue for both was Netaji Indoor Stadium. This time, the fair will be held on the Ballygunge Science College campus of CU.

 Approximately 60 educational institutions, both private and government-aided, offering undergraduate courses in various subjects, will attend the fair. Each will put up a stall, in addition to the special biotechnology pavilion. 

 ?Seminars and discussions will be held on all the days of the fair. Representatives from industries will deliver lectures on job opportunities and advise students on pursuing studies in emerging subjects, particularly biotechnology,? said D.J. Chattopadhyay, dean of science and technology, CU.

 The seminars will be followed by open sessions, at which students will get the opportunity to discuss career prospects.

 Institutes offering courses in a vast range of areas, including engineering, medicine, management, hotel management, travel and tourism, fashion designing, media studies, aeronautical engineering and marine engineering, will participate in the fair.

 ?We expect a huge turnout of students on all the three days,? dean Chattopadhyay said. 

 Banks and other financing agencies offering spot loans will also put up stalls at the fair.

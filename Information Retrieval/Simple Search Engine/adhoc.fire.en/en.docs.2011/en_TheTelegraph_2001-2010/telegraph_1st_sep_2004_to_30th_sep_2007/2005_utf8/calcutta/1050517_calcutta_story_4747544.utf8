The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Centre poser on highway tram tracks 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The future development of National Highway (NH) 117 ? the 130-km stretch between Kona Expressway and Bakkhali ? has come under a cloud, with the Centre expressing concern over the traffic congestion on Diamond Harbour Road and Kidderpore.

 The Union ministry of shipping, road transport and highways, which accorded NH status to the road last year, has written to the state government, asking whether a national highway should have tram tracks on it.

 ?The road has to be handed over to the ministry for development and maintenance. While the 110-km stretch between Joka and Bakkhali has already been handed over, there are problems regarding transfer of 20 km between Kona Expressway and Joka, since the stretch has tram tracks on it,? public works department (PWD) minister Amar Choudhury said on Monday.

 A meeting to resolve the issue was held between ministers and senior bureaucrats on Monday afternoon at Writers? Buildings.

 Apart from Choudhury, commerce and industry minister Nirupam Sen, transport minister Subhas Chakraborty and the departmental secretaries were present.

 Chief secretary Ashok Gupta, finance secretary Samar Ghosh and Calcutta Tramways Company chairman Rajdeo Goala also attended the meeting.

 ?The government has no immediate plans of removing tram tracks from Diamond Harbour Road,? said Choudhury after the meeting.

 Goala, who is also Citu?s Calcutta district president, spoke strongly in favour of retaining the tram tracks on the road.

 According to PWD officials, once a road is accorded national highway status, the Union ministry becomes its owner, following the issuance of a no-objection certificate by the state regarding transfer of the asset.

 All subsequent expenses on the road are borne by the Centre. In addition, all work on the road, including digging for essential services like water pipeline repairs or laying of telephone lines, can be carried out only after an approval by the Centre. 

 According to state officials, problems have arisen in acquiring land for the stretch between Kona and Joka.

 ?While land around Kona belongs to Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority, the stretch along Kidderpore and Diamond Harbour Road passes through Calcutta Municipal Corporation land. There are many underground utilities here, including water pipelines from Garden Reach. Also, the tram tracks are posing a problem,? PWD minister Choudhury said.

 State officials feel that since the NH 117 runs through the city, the removal of tram tracks on it will not solve the problem.

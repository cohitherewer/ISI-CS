 Academy Theatre celebrates its 21st anniversary with Manchageeti: Swadeshpriti, a programme that explores an oft-overlooked facet of Bengali theatre songs. Tracing the close connection of the Bengali stage with nationalist movement and aspirations since the days of the Sepoy Mutiny in 1857, the programme emphasises the role of Bengali theatre as a driving force that inspired many to join the country?s freedom struggle. As drama became a potent vehicle to hold aloft the flag of patriotism, the demand for independence as expressed in theatre-songs turned into concerted clarion calls for the freedom of the motherland. Taking in its sweep two centuries of musical and political history, this evening?s presentation also attempts to bridge the cross-cultural divide that exists in the songs of Bengal and Bangladesh. Participants: Riddhi Bandyopadhyay and Devajit Bandyopadhyay in songs and Bratati Bandyopadhyay and Ramendu Majumdar in narration. Script and direction: Devajit Bandyopadhyay. Presented in collaboration with Victoria Memorial, Calcutta.

 Event: Programme of Bengali nationalistic theatre songs 

When: Today at 6 pm 

Where: Rabindra Sadan

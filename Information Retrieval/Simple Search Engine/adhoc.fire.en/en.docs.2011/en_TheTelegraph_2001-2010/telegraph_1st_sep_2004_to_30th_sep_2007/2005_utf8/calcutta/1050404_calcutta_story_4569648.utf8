 Sailen Bhattacharjee: Medical waste earmarked for incarceration and burning down are often recycled. And this happens in the open. The pollution control board is responsible for tackling the problem. What are you doing to stop the practice?

 It is the board?s duty to control the disposal of used clinical substances under Hazardous Substance Management Act. Clinical establishments that are not treating their wastes properly and are allowing it to be recycled are to blame for the problem. Local people should lodge a complaint with us if they notice a clinic or hospital disposing such waste in municipal vats. If we receive complaints, we will definitely take action and book the offenders.

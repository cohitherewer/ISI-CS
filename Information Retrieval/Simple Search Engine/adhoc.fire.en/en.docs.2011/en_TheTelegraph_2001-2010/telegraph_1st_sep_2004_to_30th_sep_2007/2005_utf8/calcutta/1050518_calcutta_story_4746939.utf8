 Packing a punch with puff pleasures

 SANGITA SULTANIA G. ROY

 Move over nicotine patch, give them a skeleton ashtray to take away the punch from puff pleasures. The ominous ashtrays are bound to drive home the point every time they accept a tip from the smoker, unless of course the puffee has reached that stubborn, dont-care stage.

 If youve tried all and failed to get your friend or family member to quit smoking, this last ditch measure couldnt hurt. Besides, the objects look rather cute sitting on a bedside table. 

 Made of polyresin, the ashtrays have a menacing but jaunty vibe to them as skeletons in myriad postures merrily jam on various musical instruments, casually carrying an open vat to be used as an ashtray that says DEATH.

 Sometimes the skeletons come with spring heads, as if to head-bang with their own beats on percussions, guitar, sax, clarinet and what have you as they congregate for the graveyard shift.

Others casually lie around holding out a giant bony hand to accept the death penalty. Some even have the nerve to be smoking a half-burnt fag themselves, as if to say, look like me!. 

 They have been attired in cocky country gear to suit the mood. 

 The Wild West theme is clinched by giving the objects an antique, rather washed out treatment, with splashes of bright colours to tone down the gruesome picture. Subtlety is the last word on ones mind here.

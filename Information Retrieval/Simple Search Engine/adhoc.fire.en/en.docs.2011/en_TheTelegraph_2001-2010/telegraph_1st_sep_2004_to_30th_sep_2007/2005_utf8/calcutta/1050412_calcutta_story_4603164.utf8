 Hotel halt reunites couple

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The high court has succeeded in uniting a couple engaged in a legal battle.

 On April 7, a division bench had ordered the couple to spend four days together at a city hotel. On Monday, the couple came to the court straight from the hotel and told the bench that they would not separate.

 ?I am really thankful to the judges. They have made an unprecedented gesture and awarded us time to realise each other?s problem. In these four days, both of us decided to make a fresh start,? said Dipanjana Das, the wife.

 Husband Mithun, who was sitting beside her in the courtroom, told the bench that he was eager to look after his wife and two children. ?We had a lot of discussions over the past four days. We have decided to stay together,? he added.

 Wishing them luck, the bench of Justice Amit Talukdar and Justice S.P. Mitra said: ?We hope you will lead a happy and peaceful life.?

 Fearing arrest following Dipanjana?s complaint against him with Belghoria police station under Section 498A of the IPC (cruelty and torture on housewife), Mithun had moved the high court for anticipatory bail. 

 The bail was granted on Monday.

 Normally in such matters, the court passes an order after assessing the gravity of the situation. But in this case, the division bench called both the husband and the wife to appear before it.

 When the court came to know that the couple had two children ? an 18-month-old boy and a month-old girl ? it preferred to work out a rapprochement between the two.

 ?Talking to the couple, the the court also realised that a battle of egos between the fathers of Mithun and Dipanjana was the principal reason for the deteriorating relations between the two,? said Swaswata Gopal Mukherjee, who appeared for the husband. 

 It was Mukherjee who suggested to the court that the couple be sent to a hotel. 

 Jayanta Narayan Chatterjee, who represented the state, also expressed his happiness over the development. 

 ?The court has set an example. Let it be followed by others,? he said.

 Date set for convention hub 

 - 29 companies bid for Rajarhat prestige project

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The state government announced on Friday that work on ?India?s biggest convention centre?, to be built at New Town, Rajarhat, would start next year. A 100-acre plot has already been allotted for the purpose. 

 ?The project will cost between Rs 1,500 crore and Rs 2,500 crore,? said housing minister Goutam Deb after inaugurating Aahirini, the first commercial complex in New Town, developed by Peerless.

 The convention centre will have four auditoriums, five-star and three-star hotels, a golf course, conference halls, service apartments for corporate biggies from out of town, spas and other modern amenities. 

 ?The project will be a private one. Twenty-nine companies have bid for the global tender. We will prepare a shortlist of the companies within a month-and-a-half,? Deb stated. 

 Most of the bidders are multi-national companies with experience in building convention centres.

 ?National players have also tied up with international companies to bid for the project,? the minister added.

 The work will be done in phases. ?The design of the convention centre is extremely important. We have information that renowned architects have been included in the bidding process by the companies,? elaborated Deb. 

 He also announced the government?s plans to construct 20,000 flats on 150 acres in New Town for people belonging to middle and lower income groups.

 ?There will be a mini-township exclusively for the middle and lower middle-class people. About 100,000 people will stay in it,? Deb explained.

 Construction of the township is likely to start in November this year, said Housing and Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco) officials. The government will fix the prices of the flats.

 Deb revealed that discussions were being held in the ministry regarding the price of plots meant for IT companies in New Town. He maintained that the plots were being sold at reasonable rates.

 There are three categories of IT plots in New Town. The highest price is sought from those setting up companies. The second category of plots are earmarked for global players. The cheapest category of plots are offered to small companies, mostly set up by entrepreneurs from the state.

 The shops in Aahirini, the minister said, will be allotted to village youths whose plots had been purchased or acquired by Hidco to set up the township.

 The four-storeyed commercial complex will house a bank with ATM facilities and a departmental store on the ground floor. The shops on the second and third floors will cater to the daily needs of the residents. The third floor has a restaurant-cum banquet hall.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fresh fashion fulcrum of change

 - Reinvention buzz at retail titan: Merchandise and mindset geared to women and youth

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Vibrant colours and rapid rack renewal lie ahead at Pantaloons

 ?What Calcutta thinks today, India does tomorrow? ? went the campaign catchline when Pantaloons opened its Gariahat store in 1997. A sense of d?j? vu will rule the racks when the Mumbai-headquartered chain, largely responsible for triggering the recent retail revolution in Calcutta, rolls out its ?Fresh Fashion? format at the same address on Wednesday.

 Pantaloon Retail is re-launching its Pantaloons chain of stores with respect to ?logo, brand communication, physical layout, merchandise and mindset?, and Calcutta, the best-performing pad for the group, has been picked as the reinvention rendezvous.

 ?We have always felt very comfortable in Calcutta and kicking off the national re-launch at Gariahat has been both our plan and desire,? Sanjeev Agrawal, president - marketing, Pantaloon Retail (India) Ltd, told Metro from Mumbai on Sunday.

 Fresh is the fulcrum of change at the new-look Pantaloons, with the chain adopting the ?multiplex approach to fashion? ? fresh, new, cool and hip, where new trends are set today and re-set tomorrow, with a 30-day rack-renewal pledge. ?We will have perishable fashion items, to be rolled over every 30 days, in sync with our emerging marketing policy, which has fashion as the axis,? said managing director Kishore Biyani, who has always heeded the learning curve in Calcutta.

 From being an umbrella family store, the focus has veered towards fashion, with ?more aggressive offerings? for women and youth. ?Of course, there?ll still be apparel for the entire family, but with a more individual perspective, defining the hopes and aspirations of today?s India, which is essentially young,? explained Agrawal.

 The look and feel of the new stores will be fresh, visually stimulating, light and attractive. While the shop-floor area at Gariahat has been doubled (nearly 30,000 sq ft now, across four levels with a Food Bazaar), the front fa?ade at 22, Camac Street, too, is changing.

 With footfalls more frequent, the demand for a quicker turnover of merchandise is rising, and the management at Pantaloon Retail is gearing up to crush the speed of delivery ?from mind to market? through more efficient supply-chain management.

 ?We have redefined most of our brands from the youth?s perspective and tags like UMM, RIG, Lombard and Bare Denim, embodying the soul of the store, have elicited excellent response,? stressed the marketing chief.

 Pantaloons bosses hoped the fresh formula can fire sales growth of at least 30 per cent (50 per cent in born-again Gariahat) this Puja.

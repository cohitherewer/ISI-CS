 Epilepsy link in suicide by scholar

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A 24-year-old research scholar, attached to Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics, Mumbai, committed suicide in an apartment on Manoharpukur Road, in Tollygunge, late on Wednesday night.

 Police said Dip Roy hanged himself from the ceiling of his bedroom. He was suffering from epilepsy and that might have led him to take his life, said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner (I), detective department. 

 No suicide note was found and preliminary investigation did not suggest any foul play, he added.

 ?His father, Amitabha Roy, works with a central government undertaking as a senior executive officer and is presently posted in Bangalore,? deputy commissioner Singh said.

 Dip came down from Mumbai to join his father in the city a few days ago. 

 ?Roy was on an official tour and had some project work here. He and Dip put up at the firm?s apartment in Tollygunge,? a police officer said.

 Dip spent all of Wednesday at the apartment alone. ?His father left for work in the morning. He returned around 11 pm and finding the main door locked from within, he used a duplicate key to enter the apartment,? another officer of Tollygunge police station said.

 After searching for his son in all the other rooms, Roy entered the bedroom, only to find Dip hanging from the ceiling. 

 On hearing Roy?s calls for help, residents of the building rushed to the spot. They summoned a doctor, who pronounced the young man dead. Officers from Tollygunge police station also rushed to the spot after being informed by the local people.

 A thorough search of the apartment revealed nothing. Initially, the policemen were clueless about the cause of the death. 

 ?We came to know about Dip?s ailment while talking to his father. He had been suffering from epilepsy since childhood and was undergoing treatment,? an officer said.

 The body was sent for post-mortem. ?We will be able to tell the exact time of death and the reason behind it only after receiving the post-mortem report,? the officer added.

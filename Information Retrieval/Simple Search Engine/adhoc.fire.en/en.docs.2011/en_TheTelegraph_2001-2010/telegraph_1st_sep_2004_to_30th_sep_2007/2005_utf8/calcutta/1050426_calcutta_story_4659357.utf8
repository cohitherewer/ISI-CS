 A sense of direction 

Fenf Shui Matters 

 Pinky Kapoor

 Fountains and birdbaths both represent the water element and should be placed in the north to enhance business, east to enjoy good health and southeast to enjoy an easy inflow of cash

My date of birth is 27.02.87. Next year I will be appearing for my board exams and would like to know which stream of education is best suited for me, according to Feng Shui. Basically, I am a lazy person and want to know of the most favourable directions, colours and the element suited to my personality. Also, I recently purchased an aquarium and would like to know the best place to place it.

 The Solution: You are a strong fire person and will be most comfortable in an environment that is suggestive of earthy, metallic and water elements and their respective colours like beige, cream, yellow, rust,white and blue. Presently you are under the influence of earth element, which represents your intelligence. This means that you should do very well in your board examination. Your favourable directions are northeast,west, northwest and southwest. Any course connected with computers should be beneficial for you. The aquarium should be placed in the north of your living room to give you a successful career. 

 Recently we bought the terrace rights above our duplex flat. Could you please suggest the best place for a hammock, a water fountain, a birdbath, birdfeeder, barbecue and a small cottage for having coffee in the rains? I would also like to keep a metal swing for my kids.

 The Solution: A hammock is best placed in the northwest, which is related to movement. Fountains and birdbaths both represent the water element and according to your priority should best be placed in the north to enhance business, in the east to enjoy good health and in the southeast to enjoy an easy inflow of cash. The birdfeeder along with the fountains placed in any of the above directions where they will fly in and out will further bless your aspirations. 

 The south, ruled by vibrant fire energy is the best place to have grills and barbecues for entertainment purposes. A small solid structure where a couple can sit and have coffee should be placed in the southwest corner. 

 A metal swing when installed in the west automatically activates the children?s area and thus enhances its metal element. Such a setting would be ideal according to Feng Shui principles.

 My daughter is 29 years old and has a good job in America. Our main cause of worry is that she is still single, and this leads her to depression. On my last visit to her house I noticed that she had displayed pictures of successful women, to draw inspiration from them. Could this be one of the reasons for her still being single? Please guide.

 The Solution: Keeping pictures or a painting of single women at this point in life definitely has a negative impact on marriage proposals. When we look at these solitary images, they subtly affect our subconscious mind andwork negatively for a girl who is looking for a life partner. This may lead her to depression. The best way out is to remove pictures of single ladies and replace them with successful happily married couples. I hope she is not occupying the southwest room of her apartment, as the ruling stable earth energy of this area will prevent her from getting married. Ideally, she should start using the northwest room, which is known for its great movement. She should remove all her photographs from the southwest room and place them in the northwest corner. The entire procedure will have a positive effect on her mind. These changes should hopefully lead to much better marriage prospects.

 A few months back my mother presented us with a few attractive wind chimes on our first anniversary. We hung them at random in different parts of our flat. Soon, we started quarrelling amongst ourselves. A few days ago, I removed these wind chimes presuming they were causing the commotion. Please let me know the favourable directions for hanging such chimes because I have sentiments attached to them.

 The Solution: To avoid arguments and quarrels in the house it is necessary that these wind chimes are not wrongly placed. The ones that have metal rods are best hung in the north to give a boost to stagnating businesses. Help from mentors are attracted by these wind chimes when hung in the northwest and to activate the children?s luck we need to hang them in the western sector. If you want to enhance fame, health and wealth then use wooden wind chimes in the south, east and southeast respectively. Energy from southwest and northeast directions is never stimulated and stirred with wind chimes ? southwest being the marriage corner and northeast, connected with the mind.

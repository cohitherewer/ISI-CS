The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The hills are alive?

 ?With the sound of Rituparno?s Khela. Reshmi Sengupta listens in

 In the last week of November, hilly Chalsa is warm and sunny like an August afternoon. A road, lined with a blanket of trees, makes its lonely way towards the Indo-Bhutan border. At the point where it crosses a dry riverbed, a portion of the paved road has been blocked by the teams of two film-makers ? Prosenjit and Rituparno Ghosh.

 Prosenjit is shooting Nalak, a feature film based on the Vedic-age story by Abanindranath Tagore, while Rituparno is shooting Khela, with his sights set on the Tollywood hero now behind the camera.

 Khela, the film revolving around the filming of Nalak, features Manisha Koirala as Prosenjit?s wife, Raima Sen as a costume designer, Shankar Chakraborty as a film producer and child artiste Akashneel Dutta Mukherjee.

 Balancing himself on the stony riverbed, a bearded Prosenjit with unkempt hair peers through the lens, Raima and Akashneel beside him. Two fire services engines start spraying water on them ? it?s a rain sequence for Rituparno?s film, but there are no rain machines at hand ? sending the three scurrying for cover in the crowd of locals who have walked a mile to catch some filmi action.

 ?I am handling the camera and taking shots from the trolley, but all this is easy for me as I am used to it,? says Prosenjit. ?I feel this is my best role till date. It?s a men-oriented film, very much unlike Ritu?s films. As part of the film within the film, we (eight-year-old Akashneel and him) are always on the move from one camp to another, with the police on our heels. And the film-maker I play (Raja) is very much like me; a complete workaholic,? he adds.

 Bright shades and lots of light mark the texture of Khela, projected as a family film. Among the medley of colour-coordinated plastic chairs, convoy of cars and costumes, cinematographer Abhik Mukhopadhyay has been tackling the challenging task of shooting a film within a film.

 ?The film within a film has been done several times before. There?s Truffaut?s Day for Night... Catching the chaos of a film unit is the most difficult thing here. The moment you try and arrange the props, it looks artificial,? explains Abhik.

 Behind closed doors

 An old sprawling bungalow perched on the hilltop with a blue stream running below is Manisha?s baaper bari in Khela. On the lawns outside, a huge crowd has gathered to catch a glimpse of the Bollywood beauty. Manisha, in between learning her Bengali lines, climbs down a flight of stairs, greets the crowd and exchanges a few words in Nepalese, much to their amusement.

 ?Dada, ektu edika takan na,? a woman pleads with Prosenjit, who soon accompanies Manisha down the stairs.

 This, going by the story line, is Kurseong, where Manisha has returned after a fight with her film-maker husband and where he, in turn, has taken shelter from the police with his child actor.

 Dressed in a kalamkari sari and a shawl, Manisha settles down beside Prosenjit to play the perfect home-maker, tea tray in hand.

 ?There?s a lot of substance in my character. I am trying to understand what Rituparno wants of the character and give it a shape. Ritu is my favourite director. After Mani (Ratnam) and Sanjay (Leela Bhansali), there has been a huge gap, which has now been filled,? says Manisha, who will be seen lip-syncing to the Tagore song Chhaya ghanaichhe boney boney.

 And though there?s Raima in Raja?s life, Rituparno hasn?t penned a love triangle with the three.

 ?Raima has a crush on the film-maker but he doesn?t reciprocate her feelings. He treats her and the child actor alike. This man has had a rift with his wife over having a child. But while working with the child actor, there?s a transformation in him and at the end he returns to his wife,? says Prosenjit, who kidnaps the child actor when his parents are reluctant to let him work in Nalak. 

 ?And I am trying to follow Ritu?s way of dealing with children. He treats them as mature people.?

 Raima, after being Ashalata in Rituparno?s Chokher Bali, is happy that she gets to play Anjali here, a character that is a lot like her. 

 ?I go around getting the boy ready for a shot as Boombada (Prosenjit) gives instructions. I used to observe our costume designer on the sets of Parineeta ? how she used to run around and get stressed out,? says Raima, who has been given an image makeover with hair tied back, rimmed glasses and casual Indo-western clothes designed by Delhi-based Joy Mitra.

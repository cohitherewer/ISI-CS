Big fight for big night

 Kate Winslet: In the run

The Golden Globes are over and now the big one?s up 

ahead. All eyes are focussed on Hollywood?s Kodak Theater, which hosts the 77th 

Academy Awards on February 27, with nominations scheduled to be announced in the 

next few days.

 If the Globes was anything to go by, the Oscars should be a real close and interesting contest. There are plenty of big names on the possible nominees? list, ranging from directors like Martin Scorsese to actors like Leonardo DiCaprio, actresses like Kate Winslet and even rock stars like Mick Jagger.

 Leading the pack is Martin Scorsese?s The Aviator, tipped to win Best Picture. Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio team up again after Gangs of New York to bring to the big screen the story of Howard Hughes, an aviator and Hollywood producer of the 1930s and 40s. 

 The film looks at the early years in Hughes? life, from the 1930 production of Hell?s Angels to the 1947 test flight of the Blue Spruce, when he was 42. It also focuses on his romances with stars like Katharine Hepburn (played by Cate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale).

 Scorsese directing DiCaprio: Top favourite

 DiCaprio puts in a stellar performance as the moody perfectionist and is ably supported by Blanchett and Beckinsale. The Aviator looks set to soar at the Oscars and repeat its Globes success. Besides DiCaprio?s try at Best Actor and Scorsese?s at Director, Cate Blanchett as Best Supporting Actress and John Logan for Screenplay must also be in the running.

 DiCaprio should be worried of competition particularly from one other actor ? Jamie Foxx. His depiction of legendary singer Ray Charles in Ray has been very well received by fans and critics. The blind singer?s tale may earn director Taylor Hackford a nomination for Best Director and Best Picture. Foxx won at Golden Globes in the Best Performance By An Actor In A Motion Picture ? Musical Or Comedy category.

 There may be competition from another veteran in the form of Johnny Depp, who was nominated at the Globes for Finding Neverland. The movie is sure to receive a nomination for Best Picture, as well as manage a Best Supporting Actor entry for Freddie Highmore and a Best Supporting Actress for Kate Winslet.

 Directed by Marc Forster, Finding Neverland is about the experiences of J. M. Barrie, the creator of Peter Pan, which led him to write the book. Drawing from his time spent with four children who have lost their fathers, Barrie writes a story about children who don?t want to grow up. The result was one of the best-loved children?s classics ever. Yet another Oscar option for Neverland, Elton John?s Peter?s song from the soundtrack might just win Best Song.

 Johnny Depp: As close as it gets

 Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind has another common factor with Neverland besides being one of the big hits of recent times. Kate Winslet stars with Jim Carrey in the film where protagonist Joel finds out that his girlfriend Clementine has had her memories of their tumultuous relationship erased through a psychiatrist?s experimental procedure. Frustrated at still being in love with the girl who has forgotten him, Joel plans to undergo the same process himself to forget Clementine. The film mostly takes place inside Joel?s mind following the memories of Clementine each time a memory is replaced.

 Winslet could be up for an Oscar for her role in the film.

 Old horse Clint Eastwood is sure to have a significant presence at the awards, too. His directorial venture Million Dollar Baby won him the Best Director?s award at the Globes and the Oscars could well see a repeat. Eastwood himself stars in the film, which chronicles the life of boxing trainer Frankie Dunn. Estranged from his daughter, Dunn is hesitant to get close to anyone, till he comes across Maggie Fitzgerald, looking for someone to believe in her talent. Hillary Swank won over critics and fans at the Globes with her performance. It remains to be seen if the Oscars hold a similar fate for her and Eastwood.

 The animation films, as every year, should see fierce competition with blockbusters like Shrek 2, Shark Tale and The Incredibles battling for the golden statuette. Besides productions by the usual suspects, Pixar and Disney, a surprise in this category may come from Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence. Japanese anime creator Mamoru Oshii plans to repeat the super success of Ghost in the Shell ? a cartoon feature made in 1995 that directly inspired the Matrix trilogy ? with the sequel that released almost a decade later.

 As far as music goes, Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger and former Eurythmics guitarist Dave Stewart scored big at the Globes with their song Old habits die hard from Alfie. Other frontrunners at the Oscars include Josh Groban?s Believe from The Polar Express, Adam Duritz?s Accidentally in love from Shrek 2 and of course, veteran Elton John?s Peter?s song from Finding Neverland.

 Big names, big movies and big expectations. All the makings of a magic Oscar night.

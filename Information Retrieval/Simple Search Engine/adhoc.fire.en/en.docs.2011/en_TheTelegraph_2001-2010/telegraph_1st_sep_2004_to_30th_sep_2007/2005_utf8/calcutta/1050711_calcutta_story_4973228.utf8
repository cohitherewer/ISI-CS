The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Court hurdle in fake fight

 R.K. ADHIKARY, formerly deputy commissioner (enforcement) and now special superintendent (intelligence) met readers of The Telegraph in his office to answer their queries. Participants included Sourish Misra, G. Laha, Basudeb Chowdhury, Ranajit Basu, Binay Mukherjee, Joyeeta Chatterjee and Sandip Banerjee

Sourish Misra: The problem of fake notes is on the rise in the state. Don?t you think that you need to be a little more active in tackling the situation?

 Forgery of notes is a special type of crime, and hence, the detective department generally deals with it. However, I can say with some confidence that the situation is not as bad as it seems. According to our estimates, only 0.01 per cent of the notes in circulation are fake. This should not be a ground for satisfaction. The detective department is doing its best to check the problem and we will provide whatever support is needed. We regularly inform police about complaints regarding fake notes.

Basudeb Chowdhury: How long does it take to dispense with a case after its detection?

 It depends upon the nature of the case. Unlike earlier, our cases are tried in lower courts like sessions courts. These courts, already overburdened with cases, take a long time to dispense with the new ones. Apart from this, after we make a seizure, we have to obtain a report from the forensic department to prove that it is fake. Obtaining the reports also takes a long time, delaying the filing of the case in court.

Joyeeta Chatterjee: We often hear of contaminated soft drinks. Does the enforcement branch look after these cases?

 We were under the impression that it is upto us to tackle problems regarding spurious soft drinks. Recently, officers of Ballygunge police station raided a shop that was allegedly selling contaminated soft drinks and seized some bottles. They, too, knew that we were the agency to look into the case and sent the samples to us.

 We, in turn, immediately forwarded the bottles to the laboratory of Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) for tests. The civic authorities turned down our plea saying the laboratory can only test products seized by CMC personnel.

 On checking the rule books, we found it is in fact the duty of the civic authorities to take action against people selling contaminated soft drinks. We had to release the person who had been detained in connection with the case.

 We do not have the authority to prosecute people guilty of selling spurious food items. However, if you happen to come across people or establishments dealing in adulterated food, please share the information with us. We will pass on the lead to the appropriate authorities.

Sandip Banerjee: Do you have a role in preventing the spread of fake weights and measures?

 It is the responsibility of the legal metrology department to deal with the problem of fake weights and measures. The department is also responsible for dealing with weight-related problems of branded products.

G.Laha: Apart from the long-drawn legal process, do you face any other difficulty in solving cases? 

 When we deal with copyright cases, which are cognisable in nature, we face another kind of problem. As per the law, we have to obtain permission from the registrar of trademark and copyrights to initiate investigation. This sometimes takes months. The culprit is quite often informed in between, and absconds by taking advantage of the delay. This is a big hurdle that we have been facing for some time.

 We also double-check with the companies whose brands are being forged to ensure that there is no problem later on. Though this is not mandatory and we can start a case suo motu, we get in touch with the companies to prevent the offenders from being acquitted due to lack of evidence.

 After a day devoted to motorcycles, it was back to information technology (IT) basics for Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Friday afternoon.

 The chief minister, who inaugurated COMPASS 2005, a four-day IT exhibition at Netaji Indoor Stadium, took the opportunity to reiterate past records, roll out plans and make a few promises.

 Topping the list was the assurance of full cooperation of the state government to set up Bengal?s first IT Plaza, proposed by organisers Computer Association of Eastern India. ?The association should finalise its plans for the Plaza as soon as possible, and I promise you the government will respond within a month.?

 Bhattacharjee also outlined the state government?s plans to further IT education in Bengal: ?We will be starting computer training in all secondary schools. We are already in the process of implementing a pilot project. Top-rated educational institutions such as Calcutta University, Jadavpur University and IIT Kharagpur, will be involved to further the cause of IT training and development. We have already held talks with Reliance to set up an IT institute in Kalyani, like the one they have in Ahmedabad.?

 On the hardware front, the chief minister mentioned the Videocon facility slated for Taratala.

 V.K. Bhandari, president, COMPASS, stressed the need for a hardware focus. ?The IT ministry as well as the government must support the cause of the hardware sector. We propose to build a state-of-the-art IT Plaza, where hardware manufacturers, trade channel retailers and mid-sized software companies can exist under one roof.?

 Bhandari then pitched for ?a suitable piece of land? to be allotted, in or around Calcutta, and at a ?concessional rate?.

 If to this, Bhattacharjee responded with a hint of smile, he was quite forthcoming on the need for more room for IT projects. ?Sector V is nearly full. We expect Satyam as well as the Hindujas to come and set up operations in Calcutta soon. Shortage of land does not mean that we will turn them away. New areas will have to be developed.?

 Quick to admit that Bengal was a late starter, the chief minister explained why with the IT and ITES sector, the new area of focus should be biotechnology. ?IT and biotechnology are the two branches of science that are changing the face of the world. They have created enormous wealth, opportunity and employment,? he explained.

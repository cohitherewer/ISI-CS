The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Say it with flowers, fashionably

HIMIKA CHAUDHURI

Arranging flowers might not be the most sought after 

career option for the younger brigade pursuing a degree, but it?s an occupation 

that?s keeping a whole lot of women in the city rather busy.

The interest among city ladies to gain international 

exposure in flower arrangement techniques prompted Pushpa Bitan, a society of 

floral art enthusiasts formed in 1980, to invite Cynthia Scott , an expert flower 

arranger from England for a week.

 Scott, 65, who has been instrumental in doing up some of the royal British weddings was in town taking workshops and demonstrating flower arrangement techniques for a host of Calcuttans ? from school students, to socialites to floral artists.

 ?This is my first trip to India and I am thrilled to see the interest that people here have in flowers,? says Scott, bowled over by the easy availability of foliage in Calcutta.

 ?I would end up paying a bomb to get the ingredients for this arrangement in England,? she confessed, pointing at an elaborate arrangement of roses with palm leaves.

 Reason enough, she believes, for every Indian to make an effort to include flowers and foliage in home d?cor. ?Flowers have the immediate effect of adding life to a room and it?s an inexpensive way of doing up a home.?

But what makes a good flower arranger? ?Someone with a simple sense of proportion and colour?, and knowing what colour of flowers to mix and match. ?The colour sense improves with practise and through reading books,? says Scott. Attending workshops organised by Pushpa Bitan is the other way to get started, she adds.

 Laying hands on anything that?s lying unused at home and can act as a good base for an arrangement is the first step. ?An old ceramic bowl, a simple glass container ? just about anything that can hold some flowers and leaves. It doesn?t always have to be an expensive vase,? she says of the art form that like any other is a manifestation of one?s own vision and personal style. ?When natural flowers are out of season, dry flowers and natural foliage can be used to decorate the room.?

 ?The two good things about flower arranging is that one can start with it at any age in life and never retire,? signs off Scott.

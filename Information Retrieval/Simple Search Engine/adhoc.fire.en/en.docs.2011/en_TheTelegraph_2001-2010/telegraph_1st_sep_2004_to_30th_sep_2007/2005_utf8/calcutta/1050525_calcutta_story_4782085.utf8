 Babus meet on riverfront 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A beautiful riverfront has been a long-cherished dream of many Calcuttans, planners and the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government. The means to that end are being currently worked out by the government brass. 

 On Tuesday, senior government officials, including chief secretary Ashok Gupta, discussed what must and must not be done to give the city a riverfront that it can boast of. They also deliberated on the best way to go about the task and listened to a concept plan. 

 ?Many cities, including London, have a wonderful relationship with the river. However, Calcutta and Howrah, which lie on either side of the Hooghly, simply end into the river. There is no unique rapport that the river shares with the twin cities,? a senior official said after the meeting. 

 Home secretary Amit Kiran Deb, tourism secretary R.K. Tripathy, urban development department secretary K.S. Rajendra Kumar, transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury, Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) commissioner Debashis Som and senior officials of Calcutta Port Trust attended the meeting, held at the conference room of the chief minister?s secretariat. 

 ?We discussed how the riverfront can be developed and beautified, and how a wonderful relationship can be developed between the river and the cities on its banks,? chief secretary Gupta said.

 Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority is the nodal agency for planning, monitoring and working out the details of the riverfront beautification project. Tuesday?s meeting was meant to bring together officials of all the concerned departments to work out a common course of action. 

 ?We need to put our heads together to figure out a way to implement the plan. The meeting was about the areas we need to look into and what changes should be brought about and what should not be done,? said an official who attended the meeting.

 CMC commissioner Som reportedly raised the problem of pollution at the meeting. ?One of the key points that he made was that the water must be clean for the areas surrounding it to be made attractive,? an official said.

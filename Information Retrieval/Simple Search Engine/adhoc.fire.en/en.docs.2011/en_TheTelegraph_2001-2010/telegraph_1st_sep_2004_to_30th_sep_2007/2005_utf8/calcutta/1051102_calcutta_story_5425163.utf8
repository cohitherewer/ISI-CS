Life

Bygone beats of festive frenzy

Stunts, tricks and fancy plumages detract 

from the passion and tempo of dhak magic, says musician and foodie NONDON BAGCHI

 Funny how short human memory can be. There is such a hue and cry about traffic disruption and chaotic conditions in the city during Durga puja, but people (even those who have lived here for decades) seem to have forgotten how much worse (or better, depending on ones point of view) things used to be.

 In the mid 60s we lived at the crossing of Rashbehari Avenue and Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Road, in the building next to Muktangan theatre. I remember one Mahashtami evening at about 9 pm, it took me half-an-hour to get home, on foot, from the Hazra Road/SP Mukherjee Road crossing, less than half a kilometre away!

 The road was five-ft nothing and thin as a reed and the press of humanity was so intense that at times I was propelled forward by the sheer pressure of the seething mass, my feet barely touching the ground. At other times, we just stood there, hemmed in by bamboo barricades, waiting for something to ease up somewhere ahead. It is hard to imagine that pedestrian traffic can experience such a total gridlock.

 Immersion ceremony days were something else again. The motorist even contemplated not using certain roads, and Rashbehari Avenue was one of them. Marching bands, traditional drummers, trucks bearing images of Ma Durga and flatbed trucks done up thematically like floats, formed one endless procession that moved at a snails pace, for hours together, an exhilarating pageant of lights and colour almost like the Mardi Gras in Rio, minus, of course, the dancing girls. What happens these days is a watered down version of times gone by.

 The presence and contribution of the traditional dhakis has also suffered with time. Time was when many pandals did not even rig up a music system; the dhakis did it all.

 There was one small, unpretentious pandal near Lake Market where some amazingly good dhakis came every year. I remember spending hours watching them, as they built up slowly and gathered momentum gradually, changing tempo with liquid ease, drawing us in with hypnotic power and rising to a crescendo of complete frenzy till our bodies reverberated as if we ourselves were the drums. When they stopped, the silence was deafening.

 I was delighted when this year I was approached by a company which had set up a competition called Rhythm Dhaker Ladaai (war of the drums), and they wanted me to be a judge. They had managed to source a reasonable amount of prize money and considering the crores spent on pandals, decoration and illumination, it was only fair that the drummers, such an integral part of the festival, are promoted and given every kind of support and encouragement because their art was on the endangered list.

 I could not agree more and on October 10, Saptami, I set out in the morning to visit five pandals where different groups of drummers would perform. I was to choose two groups who would feature in the final round of six to be judged the following day by Pandit Ajoy Chakraborty. 

 The level of skill was of uniform excellence but perhaps because it was a competition, some groups stopped every now and then to explain the bols ? whether they were in cycles of 12, eight or six beats and such ? which was unnecessary and interrupted the flow. Others played to the gallery with tricks and stunts that did not always work, and again detracted from the passion and the frenzy.

 However, the group that played at the community puja organised by Mukta Dal on Harish Mukherjee Road, was the pick of the bunch for me. They did not even have a dhak which is the big drum that is strapped over the shoulder and held to the side, against the hip, and played with two thin bamboo splints.

 They had two dhols (strapped around the neck, held in front and played with stout wooden costa in one hand and a bamboo splint in the other), one dhamsa (one playing surface, with a rich, deep, bass sound), one chorbori (or kurkuri), our version of the kettledrum, meant for the higher frequency delicate rolls and filigree work and one small hand-held bell-metal gong to keep the pulse, an essential part of these ensembles and usually played by younger apprentices.

 They paid scant heed to formal dressing or finely decorated instruments or whether they had an audience or not (hardly). They just started. Building up, no interruptions, seamless shifts in rhythm flowing freely with subtle and beautiful variation, throwing cues at each other, the main dhol player, a virtuoso drummer slowly going into his trance.

 People appeared on the balconies of the surrounding houses and stayed to watch and listen. Children spontaneously joined in the fun. A street dweller who in another part of the world would have been in a mental institution started dancing with a beatific smile on his face, and a stylish dancer he was too. Another onlooker, already tipsy at 11.30 am, tried to tuck a Rs 50 note into the pocket of one of the musicians but was unfortunately hustled away. In the dappled sunlight of an October morning, I thought of Fellinis film Amarcord.

 These guys carried on regardless, and could well have gone on all day and all night. They made it to the finals the next day and came fourth overall. I hope they will be back next year. I will be there, this time at night when things are really cooking. The first three places went to the drummers of Labony Estate Puja Committee (Salt Lake), followed by Jodhpur Park Sharodiya Utsab Committee (both of whom I did not see) and third placed was 21 Pally (Bondel Road),whom I did.

 Dhaker Ladaai is an excellent idea. It was well organised too. Thirty teams participated and the six finalists came from the districts of Murshidabad, Birbhum, Hooghly, North and South 24 Parganas. Perhaps the introduction of individual prizes might be a good idea as also giving the drummers the option of staying longer than the stipulated 15 minutes. And someone might tell them that while a little choreography never hurts, explanations, stunts and fancy plumage do not a good dhaki make.

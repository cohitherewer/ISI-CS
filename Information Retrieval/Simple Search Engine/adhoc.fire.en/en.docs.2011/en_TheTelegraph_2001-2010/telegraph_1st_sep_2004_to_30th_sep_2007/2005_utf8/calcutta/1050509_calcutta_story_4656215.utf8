 Ray statue due in Sector V 

 - Exhibition of sketches, posters and booklets planned

 KINSUK BASU

 The most towering figure in quality Indian cinema will soon stand tall in his own city. 

 More than a decade after Satyajit Ray?s death, the decks have been cleared for the installation of his first full statue in Calcutta. An official announcement in this regard is awaited, but information and cultural affairs department officials claimed that a bronze statue of Ray would be unveiled at Sector V in Salt Lake on May 17. 

 ?A spot has been identified near the Roopkala Kendra for installing the statue. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is expected to unveil it,? said cinematographer Soumendu Roy, one of Ray?s most trusted hands.

 Sandip Ray and Soumitra Chatterjee, who immortalised Apu on the silver screen, are likely to attend the unveiling. 

 The 11.5-ft-high statue will depict Ray in his later years, in kurta and pyjama. Seven blocks of the statue have already been assembled and it is being given the final touches. 

 ?It has been a tremendous experience. I have tried to capture the director in an introspective mood,? said 66-year-old Niranjan Pradhan, the sculptor. 

 Among those who have watched the statue being sculpted are Soumitra Chatterjee, Nemai Ghosh and Anita Agnihotri, the director of Roopkala Kendra.

 ?Agnihotri has spent hours watching me work on the statue. She asked me questions on different aspects of my sculpture,? Pradhan added. 

 Four artistes are working full-time under the sculptor?s guidance at his workshop in Khardah, on the northern fringe of the city, to complete the work.

 Once the statue is shifted to the site, Pradhan will oversee its installation to ensure that everything is done to perfection. 

 To mark 50 years of Ray?s path-breaking film Pather Panchali, plans are also afoot to hold an exhibition of his sketches, posters and booklets at Roopkala Kendra. The exhibition is likely to start on the day the statue is unveiled.

 According to insiders, the entire collection of Parimal Ray, a Ray fan, would be put on display at the Kendra. 

 ?Some rare photographs and sketches are part of the collection. It would be a treat for fans,? said an officer of the information and cultural affairs department.

 La Lossa, a specially-crafted skincare product line from Goa, has been launched in the city at Park Tropicana on Middleton Row. ?The innovative range of products has put to use French formulae coupled with traditional Indian recipes, suited for the Indian skin type,? explained a spokesperson.

 The range includes La Rose, La Scrube, La Gelle and La Orange for oily skin, La A-Rose, La A-Gelle, La Lime Clove and La Cleare for acne-prone skin. The lavender, almond and sandalwood lotions are meant to replenish ageing skin, while the mint-based gels and creams are suited for fairness purposes. Pure essential oils within many of the products act as a herbal ingredient in providing a strengthening base.

 Each of the La Lossa beauty products have been clinically tested at Arabe Cosmetics Laboratories, Panjim. 

 Season wear

 A self-taught designer with 10 years of experience, Sujata Guhathakurta can safely be called a pro at creating outfits. Sticking to the ethnic spread of sari, salwar kurta and kurti, that has been her forte for a decade, Sujata is holding her annual exhibition in the city for two days, starting March 30. ?The collection is essentially summery and has been created keeping both the wedding season and the hot months in mind,? says Sujata, of the line she will be showcasing at Genesis Art Gallery on Middleton Row.

 Working with crepe and georgette for the evening clothes and cotton for the daywear and casual range, Sujata has let natural colours dominate her palette this time. ?The bright pinks and yellows can be quite tacky in the summer months, so subtle hues are what I?ve worked with,? she stresses. 

 While a bulk of heavy saris have the contemporary stone and sequin look, an impressive part of the collection also has hand embroidery. ?I?ve always used hand embroidery over machine work, as it gives the fabric a richer look,? says Sujata of her label Naksha.

 The exhibition will also have a range of party bags with the hot pick being brocades in various shapes.

 Natural fibre

 For six years in a row, designer and handloom weaving expert Sujata Saraogi has brought in master weavers from across the country twice every year to showcase their work and get them to interact with customers. This year is no exception. After the exhibition of silks in December 2004, Cottons of India will bring the best of handwoven cotton to Calcutta from March 31 at the Cinnamom Gallery on Upper Wood Street. 

 Ranging from Maheswari to Kota, Kalamkari and cottons from Phulia, the three-day show promises to be a treat for those with a taste for fine fabric.

 ?While we have given the weavers colour and design inputs to help them get a collection to suit the urban taste, they will also be available for interactions, where customers can place personalised orders,? says Sujata. 

 The high point of the event promises to be the innovative weave that will be brought in by Chennai-based label Indigo India, which will showcase fabric made from banana and pineapple fibre. Sujata herself is going to present a line of woven and printed cottons in bright hues to match the festive feel of the ensuing Bengali New Year.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Last of only pond

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY

 Left Front secretary Anil Biswas has issued a directive that not a single waterbody is to be filled up. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has repeated words to the same effect. 

 Yet, in a blatant flout of the order, a developer in Mahestala municipality, backed by the CPM, is filling up a waterbody, the only one in the area, spread across 19 bighas.

 The promoter is being aided in the act by a prominent local unit member of the party, who is also a state government employee.

 Complaints were made to individuals and organisations ? from Anil Biswas to the chief minister, and also the pollution control board ? but the landfill work continues unhindered.

 The tank is at Rabindra Nagar and its owners are Abdul Kader Mondal and his son Abdul Kuddus Mondal, both active CPM supporters. 

 They started filling up the tank in March and soon handed it over to a promoter, who continued their work. Initially, the Mondals engaged local youth activists of the party for the landfill, before handing over the job to the promoter.

 ?We lodged a complaint with Rabindra Nagar police station, the chairman of Mahestala municipality and the land and land reforms department, but without any effect,? said a local resident. 

 Complaints were also made to the fisheries and environment ministers, and the human rights commission.

 Chairman of Mahestala municipality and local CPM leader Kali Bhandari said: ?After receiving complaints from local residents, three men on the job were arrested.?

 Pranabandhu Nag, secretary of Development Employees Joint Action Committee, who is struggling to preserve waterbodies in the area, said the promoter?s men, who were working during the day earlier, now operate at night.

 District superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas) S.N. Gupta said he has asked the officer in charge of Rabindra Nagar police station to submit a report on the contentious issue.

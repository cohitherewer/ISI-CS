The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 In tune with our past

 Indias cultural wealth, antiquated customs, traditions and ethnic diversity have the power to enthrall tourists the world over. Deeply moved by Indian music and art, Alex Stenghel was even more fascinated by the manners and rituals of its people on his first visit to this country. Ever since, he has shared a lasting relationship with India, studying its history and culture and expressing his observations through enchanting works of art. An Alphabet from the Ganges, his maiden exhibition of paintings in India, has on show works of pure imagination. Yet, by the artist?s own admission, they are inspired by his encounter in Benaras with some women who were buying tiny, ornate silver figurines. According to Stenghel, who related the religious symbols to relics unearthed from the archaeological sites of Mohenjodaro and Harappa, there is absolute harmony between the worlds of the past and the present, even in modern Indian cities. His feeling that Indian civilisation still retains the innocence, beauty and charm of a much earlier period in history, urged him to travel back in time and depict this extraordinary continuity through his apparently abstract paintings.

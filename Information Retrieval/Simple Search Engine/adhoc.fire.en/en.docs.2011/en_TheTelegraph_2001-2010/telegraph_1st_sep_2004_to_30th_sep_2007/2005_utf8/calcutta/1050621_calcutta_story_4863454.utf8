 Steer clear of water woes

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 Feng Shui doesn rsquo;t recommend the placement of water bodies in the bedroom. Hence aquariums 

 should not be placed inside. They should ideally be kept in the passage leading to 

 the room and 

 preferably against the northern wall

Q: I am a 28-year-old man living in my parents house where I have a large rectangular-shaped room to myself on the first floor. I sleep and work as an event manager from here. I have placed an aquarium in the north side of my room to give a boost to my business. But Feng Shui does not recommend having water bodies in the bedroom. Would you call this place my office or the bedroom? What can be done here to bring success to both personal and professional aspects?

 The Solution: I would take it as a studio where everything is happening in the same room. If you do not have an option to occupy another room then place the aquarium against the northern wall in the passage leading to your room. 

 But you must demarcate the sleeping area from your work area clearly with the help of a screen or low-height cabinets that could contain books and files. Try to face your auspicious direction while working and sleep with your head pointing towards your Sheng Chi direction. To give a boost to your business, display pictures of events you have organised on a blue or black background on the northern wall of your work area. To attract continuous business from your clients, place their data in the north-west corner along with a windchime with six or seven hollow metal rods or a pendulum clock.

 Q: I was married for five years and had a lovely daughter. Although I loved my wife, she got involved with somebody else and the result was a divorce. She took away all her belongings and my daughter but my wedding album and all the photographs are still with me. I am planning to get married soon and would like to know what precautions I should take to make my second marriage successful.

 The Solution: For new beginnings, it is best to get rid of old memories like your marriage album by floating it in running water of any river. You must do away with your previous mattress and ensure the new one is in one piece. 

 Any thing that is a reminder of your old relationship in your immediate environment ? mementoes, pictures or gifts received or bought together during happier times with sentimental value ? should be done away with. Space clear your room with the help of incense sticks, bells and other purifiers according to your religious beliefs. These measures are essential because your new marriage will not be successful if you have any ties with your previous wife.

 Q: I run a printing press and want to gift business cards to my uncle in Delhi who helped me set it up. As I do not know his date of birth, I am little nervous about choosing the right colours for him.

 Shreekant

 The Solution: The best way to choose colours for a business card when you do not know the persons favourable colours according to his date of birth is by seeing how the colours in general react with each other. You should see the compatibility among different colours when they are used for the background, the writing and the logo. For example, white goes well with black, blue and metallic colours like silver, gold and bronze. Green goes well with blue and black while vibrant colours like red, maroon go well with green. Earthy colours like beige, cream and yellow go extremely well with vibrant colours of the fire family. 

 It would be best if you can design a card for him with a balanced blend of all the colours that belong to the five elements of nature.

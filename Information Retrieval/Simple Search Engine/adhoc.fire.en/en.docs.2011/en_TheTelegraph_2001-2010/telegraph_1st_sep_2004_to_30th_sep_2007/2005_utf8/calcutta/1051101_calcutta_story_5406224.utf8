 West Bengal has around 33,000 villages. Yet in a state where an official listing of the heritage buildings in its capital does not exist, is it surprising that few detailed accounts are available of benighted rural Bengal?

 Debashis Basu, who is known for his research on Calcutta and genealogies and edits the journal Koushiki, gave a talk on Wednesday, organised by Suchana Cultural Centre, on the methodology of creating holistic accounts of villages. Basu said Bankimchandra was of the view that though the Oriyas had a documented history, Bengalis did not. 

 Basu stressed that documenting village life was not a mere exercise in digging up the past for the sake of nostalgia but it linked history to the present times and took a look at the future as well. The importance of the economic aspect of village life cannot be overstressed. Neither can the vexed question of caste be ignored, though raising this politically-incorrect issue can be difficult. Yet, unless such issues are addressed, documentation will remain incomplete, he stressed.

 Similarly, documentation of unsavoury and uncomplimentary aspects of village life, such as slavery in the past, crime rate, smuggling, gambling, existence of brothels and rioting, are a must. When Satishchandra Mitra met Rabindranath after publishing his history of Jessore and Khulna, the poet had said that history does not mean singing the glories of a village. Presenting a truthful account is of primary importance.

 Documentation of village life began with the British rulers unfamiliar with the flora and fauna, culture and many other features of life in India. Pioneering work was done in this field in the late 19th Century by WW Hunter, who produced the Statistical Account of Bengal and the Annals of Rural Bengal, followed up by Beveridge on Barisal and Westland on Jessore. Later, indigenes followed in their footsteps and started working on their own.

 The core of Basu?s lecture was on the methodology of such documentation, team work being best suited to it. The geographical location of the village being studied should be precisely stated. Some of the heads under which the study should be conducted included its transport system, transport fare rate, post office, telephone and computer links, radio and TV, and cataclysms experienced.

 Other important heads include status of women, family trees, utensils, archaeological remains, folk culture, business, built environment and recording oral histories. Basu ended with a note of caution, saying time was running out for undertaking such a huge task.

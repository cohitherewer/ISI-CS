 Never say die

 A dreaded condition that threatens to claim 93 million lives by 2010, the problem of AIDS as a disease is compounded by the ignorance, prejudice and stigma shrouding it. In an effort to improve public awareness on AIDS and root out misconceptions about it, Bengali television channel Aakaash Bangla hosts Ek Aakaash Swapna, a special programme on the occasion of World AIDS Day. The channel?s anti-AIDS campaign will be in the form of a cultural programme, where eminent personalities from the arena of music, art, literature, film and sport will perform live for the audience and educate them on AIDS-related issues. Participating artistes include Haimanti Shukla, Usha Uthup, Mithun Chakraborty, Sharon Prabhakar, Bappi Lahiri, Rima Lahiri, Indranil Sen, Pratik Choudhury, Shilajit, Raghav Chatterjee, Rupankar, members of Artists? Forum and Bangla bands Cactus and Lakkhichhara. Organised in association with Welfare for Indian Seamen Everywhere (WISE).

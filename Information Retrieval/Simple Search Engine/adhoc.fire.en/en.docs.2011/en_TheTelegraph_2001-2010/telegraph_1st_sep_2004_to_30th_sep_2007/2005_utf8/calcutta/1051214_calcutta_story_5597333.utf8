 Pranay Kumar Mukherjee, a marriage registrar of Howrah, on Tuesday confirmed that he had presided over the marriage of ?a couple by the names of? Mini Kanodia and Mohit Srivastav on November 22.

 The address of Mini mentioned in his register is the same as that of the 25-year-old woman who was ?abducted? from Vidyasagar Setu on Saturday evening, and that of Mohit, 23, is identical to that of the young man now behind bars for the alleged crime.

 ?The bride, according to the registry, is Mini Kanodia, daughter of Suresh Kanodia, a resident of 5, Nitya Dhan Mukherjee Road, Howrah. The groom is Mohit Srivastav, the son of Sree Hari Om Srivastav, and the resident of the same address,? Mukherjee told Metro.

 Reading out from his register, Mukherjee said the duo had served a notice for marriage on September 14 and got married at his office on November 22 at 478/1 Sarat Chandra Chatterjee Road, Howrah. 

 The notice serial number is 300/2005 and the marriage registration number is 358/2005. A certified true copy of the marriage registration is now with the Registrar General of Marriages, West Bengal.

 ?The marriage is absolutely legal and valid. It was witnessed and signed by Deboki Nandan Bhojak, Manish Kr. Soni and Santosh Sharma,? said Mukherjee.

 Bhojak and Sharma are now in jail, along with friend Mohit, for their role in the ?abduction? of Mini. Even the addresses of Bhojak and Sharma in the marriage register match the ones in the prison register. 

 In court, on Sunday, Mini, the vermilion visible on her forehead, denied the marriage, leaving Mohit and the witnesses to the registration in the lurch.

 But why? ?She simply buckled under the pressure of her family and of the legal mess that she was getting into,? feels sociologist Swapan Pramanik. 

 ?Mini?s action reflects the kind of pressure that her family and her community were exerting on her,? said psychologist Bhargavi Chatterjee Bhattacharya.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Myth magic

Screen On amp; Off

 They have been seen in different parts of the world in different outfits at different times trying to sell The Myth. And now they would finally be in India for what should be a glittering premiere at Cinemax in Versova.

 Jackie Chan and Mallika Sherawat (seen together in picture below) will be seen complimenting each other?s assets on Tuesday at the Mumbai multiplex as the red carpet will be laid out before the Stanley Tong action-adventure is unveiled in the country.

 In his one-day visit to the country, Chan will be meeting the Indian distributor of the film, UTV?s Ronnie Screwvala, and even paying a visit to the chief minister apart from appearing at the star-studded premiere.

 A movie watch at INOX can now earn you a ticket to the biggest and grandest film festival of the country ? the 36th International Film Festival of India, which gets underway on Thursday on the magic beaches of Goa.

 The INOX-IFFI contest gives you the opportunity to be at the 10-day festival without much sweat. All you have to do is catch a movie at INOX (Forum or City Centre or for that matter any INOX in any city), fill up a contest form and submit it by November 25. One lucky winner from each INOX multiplex will be flown down to Goa in style to watch the film festival screenings, witness the colourful pageantry and be a part of the grand INOX party. 

 INOX Panjim has been chosen as the ?official venue? for the IFFIes for the second year running.

 With competition hotting up like never before on Nach Baliye, it?s time for DJ Aqeel to scratch in some remix magic. The badshah of remix joins the show rustling up some foot-tapping numbers exclusively for the couples to dance to.

 Aqeel has already remixed and recorded more than 16 hit tracks for the STAR One dance show including Aa dekhe zara (Rocky), Laila o laila (Qurbani), Pyar mein dil pe (Mahaan), Humma humma (Bombay) and Jaanu meri jaan (Shaan) amongst others.

 Says Aqeel: ?I always liked this dance show because of its unique concept and now remixing songs for Nach Baliye is really like a double treat.?

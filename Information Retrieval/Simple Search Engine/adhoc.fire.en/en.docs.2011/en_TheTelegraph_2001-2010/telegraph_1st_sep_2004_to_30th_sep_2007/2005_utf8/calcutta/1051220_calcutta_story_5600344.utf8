Life

 On a revival route

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 Starting over seems to be the theme song at The Kenilworth hotel, at 7, Little Russell Street (picture by Rashbehari Das). The hotel, which had become popular as Purdys Inn, has been letting in guests again, for a month now.

 This is the original Kenilworth, which was started more than 50 years back, insists David Purdy, whose grandparents bought the hotel from a Christian couple in 1948 and turned it into a profitable guesthouse with all modern facilities. Before that, it used to be a lodge.

 This is probably the second oldest hotel in the city after The Oberoi Grand. In the early 1950s, it would be completely full of business travellers and foreigners of all nationalities. There was hardly any place in the city for people coming from outside, recounts David.

 The occupancy would be more than 150 per cent. A vacant room even for a single day was considered to be a big loss. There were people who stayed in the hotel for years on end, smiles David.

 Though he moved to England, his mother kept the hotel up and running until a few years ago when her health started failing her and she could not pay much attention to the property. Due to neglect, the place was not looked after. Finally, she passed away in May and I came down to look after the place, says David.

 For eight months, its been Mission Makeover at 7, Little Russell Street. First, the entire electrical wiring was changed. The garden had weeds up to 6 ft long, so that had to be restored to its original shape. Then it was the turn of the 10 rooms. The walls have been provided with a fresh coat of paint and the floors repaired. We have provided air-conditioning, televisions and geysers in many rooms, declares David.

 The current tariff is Rs 2,000 for air-conditioned rooms and Rs 1,500 for the non-air-conditioned ones. By the end of February, all the rooms will have air-conditioning.

 so in the coming year, David intends to set up a restaurant and an authentic English-style pub. Finally, the Purdy pitch: There are many advantages of putting up at our hotel. It is located at a stones throw from various consulates. Being close to Park Street, all the major services are at hand. Moreover, every single room here is the size of a mini apartment, with separate dining and sitting space. And its almost like turning a page to the past, in modern-day comfort.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 All in the STARs

 Brand tie-ups are on an absolute roll in Bollywood these days. So much so that the ties are being forged almost a year before a films hits the theatres. The latest in line is Rakesh Roshan?s sequel to Koi? Mil Gaya, the Hrithik Roshan-starrer Krrish, with an exclusive STAR TV tie-up.

 The alliance includes exclusive appearances of Hrithik in various shows on the STAR Network, global satellite distribution of the much-awaited movie, in-movie placement, premieres in India and in international markets, and promotional rights.

 ?It all took off with the in-film advertisement,? Rakesh Roshan tells Metro. ?In the movie, the heroine, played by Priyanka Chopra, works in STAR as an episode producer. So we took that relationship forward and joined hands for promotion and other associated marketing events.?

 Roshan?s film production company Filmkraft had previously tied up with the Singapore Tourism Board, committing to shoot 60 per cent of Krrish there. ?We have already shot there and are going for another two-month schedule after which we come back to Mumbai and wrap up shooting in another 30 days here,? says the star dad. ?The film should release in June or July 2006.?

 Krrish has been in the news ever since production began earlier this year and Hrithik spent months training with some big names in international martial arts for the gravity-defying stunts. While some of the stunt sequences have already been canned, around five more are yet to be shot.

 For STAR, too, it?s a coup of sorts. The film actually takes the story of the blockbuster Koi? Mil Gaya forward and is billed to be the biggest movie of 2006.

 Bagging Krrish will boost movie channel STAR Gold, which saw Swades recording far higher TRPs than Dhoom and Hum Tum beamed on other channels. Sameer Nair, chief operating officer, STAR India, says: ?At STAR we have always associated with the biggest movies and biggest stars of Indian cinema and now we are ready to partner with Rakesh and Hrithik Roshan.?

 The man himself is happy with the tie-up. ?I am delighted to work with a channel like STAR which gives me an opportunity to reach millions of viewers instantly,? said Hrithik, in an e-mail message. ?We are confident that people will appreciate the magic that we will create together in the forthcoming months.?

 What?s more, Hrithik has committed to a special performance for the channel during the build-up to the release of Krrish.

 Library eyes digital benefit

 A STAFF REPORTER

 National Library has undertaken a project to digitise all its manuscripts and official documents to preserve them better. 

 ?Some of our manuscripts belong to the 17th and 18th centuries. Such precious documents have to be preserved for the benefit of our research scholars and academicians,? said library director Sudhendu Mandal.

 The Centre has sanctioned Rs 2 crore to the library for the digitisation project. ?We have already started work. It will take a few years to complete the process. The first phase will be ready by 2007,? the director added.

 Mandal said that a committee comprising experts from Jadavpur University, Calcutta University and Visva-Bharati had been constituted to oversee the digitisation process.

 Once digitised, officials feel, the library will be more reader-friendly. 

 The readers would be able to check the details of the books and journals they are looking for through computers that will be installed at the newly-built Bhasha Bhavan.

 The digitisation will continue along with the process of shifting of the 30-lakh-odd books, journals and documents to Bhasha Bhavan. ?We expect both projects to be completed by end-2007,? said a senior library official.

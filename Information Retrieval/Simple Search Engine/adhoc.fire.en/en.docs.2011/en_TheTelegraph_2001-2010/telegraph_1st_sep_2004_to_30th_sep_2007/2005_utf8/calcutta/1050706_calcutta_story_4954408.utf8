The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Civic board keeps slums in humour

 - Quality services, with the poor in mind

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has mandated the new Left Front board of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation not to undertake development projects at the cost of slum-dwellers, while one of his Cabinet colleagues sought to draw the contours of the board?s agenda.

 ?Of around seven million people in the city, 170,000 live in slums. Like in Delhi or Mumbai, we can?t ask the poor to vacate their slums to enable us to beautify the city,? Bhattacharjee said at a victory rally of the Left Front outside the civic headquarters on Tuesday. ?The previous board, run by the Trinamul Congress-BJP, did execute some ambitious projects, but none helped the poor.?

 Municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya, while expressing displeasure over the mayor?s statement that he would continue his legal practice if he got time, revealed a list of what the civic board would strive to achieve.

 The board, he said, will usher in revenue reforms, including introduction of area-based tax valuation, form ward committees and implement annual plans at the ward level. The new valuation system is expected to make taxing more transparent and efficient by putting an end to the inspector raj.

 ?Basically, the civic body should focus on providing quality services ? like drinking water, conservancy, slum development and education ?to the citizens. Big development projects should be left to the state government,? he said.

 As for introduction of water tax for all, the minister said: ?What the last mayor couldn?t do in five years, how would Bikashbabu do in five days? He will have to discuss the issue with his council members first. Other sensitive issues, like hawker eviction, too, will need time.?

 Another challenge before the board is amending the building rules to make provisions for rainwater harvesting, use of solar power and earthquake-proof structures.

 The previous board?s record in implementing the ADB-sponsored Calcutta Environment Improvement Project drew flak from the minister. ?Formation of ward committees is a must, but the Trinamul board was negligent about it.? 

 Asked about the mayor?s comment on his legal practice, the minister quipped: ?Bikashbabu has said he will practice law only if he finds time. But I don?t understand how he will find time. I hope he will be a full-time mayor.?

 Earlier in the day, Bhattacharya was elected mayor by a 75-65 majority. In the election of the chairman, two councillors from the non-Left camp voted for Left Front candidate Nirmal Mukherjee, taking his tally to 77.

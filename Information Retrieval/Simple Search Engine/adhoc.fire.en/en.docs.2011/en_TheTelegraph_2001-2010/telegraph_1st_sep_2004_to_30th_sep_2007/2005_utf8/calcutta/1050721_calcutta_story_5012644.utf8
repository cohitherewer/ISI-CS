 The Rajarhat-Gopalpur municipality on Wednesday restored a pond that had been illegally filled up by a section of residents of Kestopur?s Missionpara area, off VIP Road.

 ?We intervened as soon as local residents informed us that a seven-cottah waterbody was being illegally filled up,? said municipality chairman Tapas Chatterjee.

 Around 10 am on Wednesday, senior officials of the civic body, a deputy magistrate of North 24-Parganas and officers from Rajarhat police station went to the spot to verify the complaint of the residents.

 The team found that two-thirds of the pond had been filled up. Digging started right away and it took more than two hours to restore the waterbody fully.

 Civic chief engineer Monojit Mukherjee explained that restoration took longer than usual because a heavy dredger had to be brought in from the public works department.

 Owner Kartick Nasker alleged that the pond was being filled up by some realtors from the locality, with the backing of former CPM councillor Subir Mandal and his associates. The earth used came from Kestopur canal, which was dredged last year.

 A family member of Nasker said Mandal had approached Hidco, which was desilting the canal, for using the soil. ?Hidco officials had filled up my pond with soil from the canal without my knowledge. Though we were not involved in any way, the municipality sent us a letter last month asking us to pay Rs 16,000 for restoring the pond. This is unfair,? said Nasker. 

 Mandal refused comment, but civic chairman Chatterjee dismissed the allegations against Hidco. ?I don?t think the agency was involved in filling up the pond. It must be the handiwork of some local people,? he said.

 There was an attempt last year also to fill up the pond. One person was arrested, but he had to be released following the intervention of some local CPM leaders, said officers of the Baguiati police outpost.

 A few more complaints about filling up of ponds have reached the municipality, which has decided to conduct a ward-wise survey for identifying waterbodies. The fisheries department had conducted a similar survey, but it failed to record some ponds.

 ?Complaints will be looked into as soon as we receive them, on the phone or in writing. Action will be taken against the guilty,? Chatterjee warned.

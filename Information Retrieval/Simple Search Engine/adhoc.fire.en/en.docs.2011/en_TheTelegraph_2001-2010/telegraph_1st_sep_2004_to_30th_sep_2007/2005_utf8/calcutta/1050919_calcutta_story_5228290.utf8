 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s government is drawing up an action plan to revamp Howrah.

 At a meeting last week, Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) officers, Howrah?s mayor and some other state officers put their heads together to give shape to the government?s plan, meant to give a boost to Howrah?s economy by improving its riverfront. The plan includes gainful use of unused plots and old buildings other than those on the riverfront.

 According to the Howrah Rejuvenation and Development Plan, unused plots and warehouses will be utilised by developing IT hubs, service industries, hotels, shopping malls, shops, office buildings and commercial complexes, particularly along the Howrah riverfront.

 ?We have already started identifying areas that can be made part of the rejuvenation plan for Howrah. The first step involves creating a concept plan ? which we have already taken up ? and then we will bring together the different agencies concerned so that there can be an exchange of ideas,? said a senior CMDA officer involved in developing and executing the project. 

 The concept plan is being prepared jointly by the CMDA and the Howrah Municipal Corporation. A detailed project report will be placed before the chief minister after the areas are identified and some of the projects take final shape.

 The Howrah rejuvenation programme originated from a visit by senior officers of the state urban development department to London, Belfast and Liverpool in July-end, following which the government had announced that Calcutta and its twin city Howrah will be revived on the lines of the Belfast-Liverpool model.

 Explaining the situation in Belfast-Liverpool, urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya had said: ?There were many closed factories and warehouses in these places and the economy was suffering. The authorities focused on developing the riverfront, along with other unused plots and old buildings, which led to improvement of the economy. The state government intends to do the same for Howrah so that the district?s economy gets a fillip.?

 Agencies like Calcutta Port Trust, the railways, Howrah Municipal Corporation, Howrah Improvement Trust, Calcutta Improvement Trust and owners of closed factories will be involved in the discussion. ?Though improvement of the riverfront means makeover of both its Calcutta and Howrah sides, at the planning stage, we are focusing only on Howrah. 

 ?There should not be any clash of interests. Which is why the CMDA intends to bring together all the agencies concerned, and hold a brainstorming session very shortly,? the official added. 

 The rejuvenation plan involves beautification, which is why the concept plan has a special focus on developing green zones dotting the riverfront, ?not just commercial estates and shopping malls?. 

 The CMDA officer said: ?One of the main aims of the project is creation of job opportunities.?

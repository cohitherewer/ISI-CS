The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 New-age kitchen craze, melody mania unplugged

HIMIKA CHAUDHURI, ZEESHAN JAWED

The 

kitchen has come a long way from being a dingy hole in the wall housing a stove. 

It is now the place to bond and recuperate after a hard day?s work as dining and 

cooking spaces get merged. 

 Waking up to the need of the hour is Life Style, a complete kitchen care store on Theatre Road. Housed in Uniworth building, it has come up with a range of stylish modular kitchens called Optima Flexi Module. 

 Introduced by Space Wood, the models are made of a light-weight material (wood dust bound together with chemicals), which makes the sets easy to dismantle and rearrange. ?Each component can be bought separately,? says store manager Shankarasish Dey.

 Maintenance is said to be hassle free and various 

permutations and combinations are possible with the various components of the 

module, without disturbing the basic structure in any way. In-built cutlery holders, 

plate racks and jar holders add to the utility.

Sizes vary from four to six ft and colours range from 

bright shades of red to subdued hues of beige. The sets are priced between Rs 

25,000 and Rs 50,000. 

Dragon drone

 Dragonfly, the Indo-American band is back in Calcutta. They rocked the city last year with stuff from their album Edge of the World, and this time it was from another new release, Blind. 

 As a part of Dragonfest (the band?s tour to create awareness about their new album) across five cities, the band played out in Calcutta at Someplace Else on Friday. They?ll be blinding audiences with their performance in Delhi, Bombay, Pune and Bangalore next. 

 In Calcutta they wowed a packed crowd with songs like Post affection, Holly rollers, Back in bed and Blind ? the title track ? from the album. 

 The band was formed in March 2001 by Miki Singh ? the lead singer, songwriter and Peter Pareck ? a blues guitarist. Steve Scully, who has played with the likes of James Taylor and Juliana Hatfield, later joined them on drums, with Mark Hickox on bass and Brother Cleve on keyboard. 

 Their music smacks of cross-cultural influences, a natural corollary of having members from various cultures. 

 ?You can call our songs intelligent, which are emotional at the same time. We also churn out a lot of groovy and funky numbers,? says Miki, a self-confessed fan of Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd.

 Most tracks on Blind combine Indian and western influences. The guitars and drums have been blended brilliantly with sitar and tabla sounds. The songs touch all genres and textures of music from jazz to rock. 

 ?The album has 14 tracks and all the members have contributed in terms of song-writing and arrangements,? shares Miki Singh. 

 You also get a CD of desi-style remixes of songs from Blind, which features some of the best names in DJing from Asia and UK. Produced in a record two weeks? time, the CD features mixes by DJs like Swami, Akin Nawaz, Dum Dum Project and Sonik Gurus. 

 Many of the songs are going to be featured in music videos, to hit the air waves soon. 

 Disc drive

 If you want to make them dance to your tune, DJ Akash will have a tip or two for you at his training school called ARD Training Centre, scheduled to open in February on CIT Road, off Padmapukur. 

 The 2003 regional topper of a popular DJ contest, Akash shot to fame when he bagged the second runners up prize at the national level. Two years down the line he?s all set to share his knowledge with aspiring disc jockeys. 

 ?When I first wanted to be a DJ, it took me a year just to grasp the mechanism of the DJ equipment since there was no training available at that time. Today, more and more youngsters are taking to DJing and I felt the need for such a training school,? shares Akash. 

 The three-month basic course, which one can join after an interview with the DJ, will comprise both theory and practical lessons. 

 ?The first month will be dedicated to lessons on the basics of DJing, history of music, kinds of music that a DJ can play and also the technical expertise in handing the equipment,? explains Akash. 

 Detailed use of the machinery and mixing will follow thereafter. Once the basic training is over interested students can enroll for practice sessions.

 ?I also intend to give the students real time exposure in the profession. They will accompany me to live shows and learn crowd interaction and interpreting techniques,? adds Akash, who also intends to invite artistes from other cities to the institute, when they visit Calcutta, in order to help students get more industry exposure.

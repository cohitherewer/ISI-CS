Life

 Not just in the name of the father

Anoushka Shankar is hoping that with Rise 

the world of music will see her in a new light, not just as the daughter of Pandit 

Ravi Shankar. The young sitarist spoke to Pratim D. Gupta about the album 

and its creative process

Its been four years since an Anoushka Shankar album hit the music stores and the last time it did, the record managed to net an Oscar nomination. 

 Rise, the latest compilation from the dynamic 24-year-old musician, was always meant to be special and Anoushka was well aware of that. So, taking a sabbatical from her hectic touring schedule, she just started making new music.

 Rise was a tremendous process of growth for me, musically and personally, she explains. 

 Its very much my own music and my journey and who I am right now. It was not only the first time I was making an album full of my own compositions, but also the very challenging position I had put myself into ? composing, arranging, editing and also producing a composition that features over 40 musicians, recorded in five different cities.

 And it wasnt easy? collaborating with Eastern and Western music maestros, blending a variety of both acoustic and electronic instruments, and often mixing them all up in eclectic ways to create fresh sounds.

 At times I felt Id bitten off more than I could chew, but to grow through all that and come out at the other end with someone (the album) I could call my own, inspired the very name Rise, Anoushka offers.

 Its rare to find in one single album everything from Flamenco-style piano and South American vocal percussion to veena and shehnai, all playing their own parts, mostly underlined by Anoushkas sitar play.

 Because of the various influences on the album, Rise belongs in the world music category, she says. But frankly, I wish there were better categories in most music stores. The stores are usually designed after a very Western-centric model and most international music is pathetically represented.

 The album is very much all Anoushka, but father Pandit Ravi Shankar does make a guest appearance in a somewhat strange fashion. One of the tracks, Mahadeva, is based on a four-line song my father wrote when I was about seven years old, Anoushka explains.

 At that time I was learning the basics of our music, more through singing than through playing the sitar, and he used to compose simple songs for me to help me remember the ragas. My parents always used to laugh when I sang this particular Mahadeva ? based on Bhairav ? because of the way I used to move my head around, trying to bend the notes with my voice.

 And this is where the Calcutta chromosome came into play. When I was recording one of the Rise tracks in Calcutta, for some reason Mahadeva got stuck in my head for two days, until it finally occurred to me that I could expand it into a beautiful piece of music, Anoushka recalls. 

 While the song my father wrote is literally the simple four lines, I saw the potential it had to really explore a very strong, theatrical, dark side of music. I immediately started working on it in Calcutta and did the bulk of it in Delhi. It was a lot of fun since its the one song on the album where I really gave vent to the other side of me, exploiting loud rhythms and darker, more moody, playing.

 Anoushka had come to Calcutta to record a couple of tracks for Rise. Red sun features her on keyboards but the highlight is the percussive bol of Bikram Ghosh and Tanmoy Bose. They duet together, vocalising very intricate rhythm bols in a way that really showcases their tight chemistry and understanding of each others musicianship, she says. 

 Its a lovely piece of music, and is one of the two tracks in Rise on which I did not play sitar. They both actually feature on a few tracks on the album, with Tanmoy also lending his gorgeous singing to Ancient love.

 So, will Rise make Pandit Ravi Shankars dream come true, of people referring to him as Anoushkas father? It is a very flattering thing that my father said about me once years ago, Anoushka laughs. He was just expressing his hopes and dreams for me and my future. It does not, in any way, take away from the fact that he is who he is.

 But Anoushka can already see by the reaction in the States, that Rise is making people see her in a new light. 

 Hopefully, it shows more of who I am as an artiste outside of just being my fathers daughter and student. Even though that is a huge part of who I am, its not me in totality.

 Rise has been released by EMI Music India.

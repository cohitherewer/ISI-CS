The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 The noise pollution on the stretch of College Street near Calcutta University Hare School, Hindu School and Presidency College is getting unbearable. Students suffer the most because of the continuous honking and are unable to concentrate in their studies. The authorities must realise that the ?no-horn? rule doesn?t apply only near reputed schools and hospitals. It must be implemented near universities and colleges as well. 

 Anil Kumar Sen,

 Ram Chandra Chatterjee Lane. 

 Ram Lochan Mullick Street in Burrabazar has literally turned into a dumping ground for the entire commercial neighbourhood, including the fruit market at Mechhua. More than two trucks of garbage are dumped daily on the street and the Corporation?s bulldozers remove only a part of it. The mound of garbage left behind is a breeding ground for insects. The stench makes the situation grimmer. The condition worsens during the rains. I hope something is done about it, and soon. 

 Arpit Chokhani, Address not given. 

 Many state buses have their route numbers written in chalk on the windscreen. The writing often gets erased in the rain. Also, state buses have a tendency of not stopping, or even slowing down, near the stops. By the time the waiting passengers can figure out the route number, the bus is half-a-kilometre away. Surely, the transport department can afford putting up proper route display boards on these buses?

 Dalim Kumar Datta,

 APC Road.

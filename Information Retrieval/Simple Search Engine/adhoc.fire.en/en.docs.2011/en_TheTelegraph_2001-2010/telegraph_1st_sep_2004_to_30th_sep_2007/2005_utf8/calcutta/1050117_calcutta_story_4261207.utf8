The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 There?s help at hand

 OUR BUREAU

Uday Sau lives in a slum on Harinath De Street, in north Calcutta. Uday, whose 

father just about manages to eke out a living, would not have been to school if 

Parshibagan Sporting Club did not come to his help.

The parents of Purnima Barui (name changed) work as daily-wagers and had 

no savings to get their daughter married. But thanks to a local club, she was 

married off earlier this month. 

 Helping poor students, donating money for marriages and collecting funds for victims of natural calamities ? clubs and social organisations in the city are playing Good Samaritans in increasing numbers.

 ?The number of such organisations has gone up over the past few years and almost all of them promptly respond to appeals for help,? said S.N. Haque, secretary, state social welfare department. 

 ?Earlier, such help was extended mainly by individuals and a handful of social organisations. But the trend has been reversed and there is now a holistic approach towards social problems,? Haque explained. He attributed the present trend to the spread of social awareness and availability of funds. 

 Asked about the philanthropic activities of Parshibagan Sporting Club, president Ramen Chakraborty said: ?There are thousands of slum-dwellers in our area and they need constant help for survival. Their children are doing well in studies and clubs and social groups must come forward to help them.?

 The club organised a cultural meet on Saturday to raise funds for tsunami victims.

 Sukumar Singh, secretary of Mass Education, which runs 60 schools providing free education, feels people now are more aware of their social responsibilities.

 ?Development organisations are now more active at the micro level. So, people are seeking their help to solve various problems,? he explained. 

 Tarun Mukherjee, of Barisha Shakti Sangha, echoed the thoughts: ?Social groups have come closer to the people.? The club runs free health camps, supports destitute children and provides help to mentally-challenged students.

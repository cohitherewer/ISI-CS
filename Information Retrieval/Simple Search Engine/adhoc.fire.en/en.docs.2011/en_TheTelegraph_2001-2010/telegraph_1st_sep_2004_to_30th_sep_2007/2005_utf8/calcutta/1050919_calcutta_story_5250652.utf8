 Family ties

 An enjoyable social comedy, Kuchh Tum Kaho, Kuchh Hum Kahe is all about longing and belonging, separation and togetherness, and the ties that bind an archetypal Indian family. Stemming from their strong ideological differences, Sumeet Sagar and his only son, Pratik, are always at loggerheads with each other. Their refusal to compromise results in a strained relationship between the two and, ultimately, the separation of the family. Pratik?s wife, Sargam, who has had a liberal up-bringing, is a champion of women?s emancipation. She urges her mother-in-law, Vasundhara, an accomplished artist, not to sacrifice her career any longer for the sake of her family. The play reaches its climax when Vasundhara and Sargam challenge each other for a reversal of roles for a month. Cast: Apara Mehta and Smriti Irani. Direction: Tushar Joshi.

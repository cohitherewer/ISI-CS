Profound but popular

Stage On amp; Off

I was dying to be in Calcutta with a play. We haven?t 

been here for the past three-four years. You know Calcutta has the best theatre 

audience in the entire country,? says Nadira Zaheer Babbar, settling down for 

a chat with a cup of coffee at a bookstore. She had missed the seminar that kicked 

off Odeon 2005 last Friday ? morning mist over the Mumbai sky had delayed her 

flight. 

Ekjute, the theatre group Nadira formed 25 years ago, 

was in town to stage Ji Jaisi Aapki Marzi at the Odeon theatre festival. 

The collage of four monologues, written by Nadira, was hard-hitting but laced 

with a lot of humour. Because as the director of the troupe, she never loses sight 

of the entertainment aspect of theatre. 

?I do not want to do plays which are so heavy that 

people find them boring. I believe in plays which are profound yet entertaining,? 

says she, having directed some ?50 productions? for Ekjute.

Despite stiff competition from Marathi, Gujarati and 

English theatre in Mumbai, Nadira has succeeded in carving out a place for Hindi 

theatre with plays like Maxim Gorky?s Lower Depths, John Osborne?s Main 

Zinda Hoon and Badal Sircar?s Ballabhpur Ki Roopkatha, among others. 

Sakubai and Dayashankar Ki Diary (featuring Ashish Vidyarthi) had 

been scripted by Nadira herself. 

?Hindi theatre is better than English and also Gujarati 

theatre, which has become very commercial. In terms of concept and content, Hindi 

productions are much better than English plays like Bottoms Up... Who doesn?t 

want money but you have to draw a line,? says the wife of Raj Babbar and mother 

of Arya and Juhi.

Born into a family with Leftist leanings ? her father 

Syed Sajjad Zaheer was a founding member of IPTA ? Nadira was the youngest of 

three sisters. ?I was very bad in studies and got a third division in my BA. We 

had then shifted from Lucknow to Delhi, and Ebrahim Alkazi, who was then the director 

of NSD, advised my father to put me in the drama school,? recounts Nadira, now 

leading a team of ?45 to 50? at Ekjute.

The group inducts new actors through workshops every 

year. ?We judge the attitude of the participants more than their talent in the 

workshops,? says Nadira, who has witnessed an exodus of acting talent from the 

stage to the screen, both big and small.

The drain has affected theatre but Nadira is not one 

to play the blame game. ?Why should you blame actors if they leave stage for television? 

Actors also need to pay their kids? fees and house rent,? she reasons. ?And theatre 

doesn?t have any competition from TV because the audiences are completely different. 

You shouldn?t hold it against them.? 

Incidentally, daughter Juhi, who has been training 

with her for the past six-seven years, is on the verge of re-launching her Bollywood 

career (her debut film Kaash Aap Hamare Hote was a complete washout).

Nadira herself turned up as Mrs Bakshi ? Aishwarya 

Rai?s mother ? in Gurinder Chadha?s Bride amp; Prejudice last year, but 

that?s a one-off thing, she clarifies. ?It was after much persuasion and after 

many offers. I don?t have the time for films. I have to look after my group, my 

family??

What Nadira mourns is the ?poor quality of literature? 

being produced these days. ?The state of Urdu and Hindi literature is very bad 

and it?s all due to the TV channels. The quality of spoken language has gone down 

immensely,? lashes out Nadira, who is presently busy writing her fifth play and 

also her autobiography. 

Her immediate plans include building a ?small auditorium? 

with a capacity of 200-250 in Mumbai. Next year marks the silver jubilee of Ekjute, 

which will be celebrated with a theatre festival. And while juggling the roles 

of wife, mother and actress, theatre remains a constant. ?Theatre main jaan 

se zyada chahti hoon??

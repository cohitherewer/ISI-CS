 Contrary orders on noise bar

 JAYANTA BASU

 Green activists and officials engaged in curbing sound pollution fear the autumn festivities this year are likely to be the noisiest in recent history, thanks to ?contradictory? orders of the Supreme Court and the state pollution control board on the issue.

 Acting on a petition filed seven years ago on enforcement of noise Acts, the apex court in July had imposed a ?complete ban on bursting sound-emitting crackers from 10 pm to 6 am?. The order also specified that noise from loudspeakers must not exceed ?10 dB(A) above the ambient noise standard? of an area or 75 dB(A), whichever is lower.

 The directive differs from the one issued by the pollution control board, which stipulates that loudspeaker sound must not cross 65 dB(A) and bans the ?use and sale of fireworks that generate noise more than 90 dB(A) at 5 m from the point of bursting?.

 Environment activist Subhas Dutta feels the two sets of directives, being contradictory, will lead to confusion among enforcers.

 An environment department official fears the court order and the administration?s laxity in seizing crackers will make the situation worse than previous years. 

 Pollution control board chairman Sudip Banerjee, however, has ruled out any scope for confusion. ?According to the noise Act, 2000, states are free to frame their own rules and these can be more stringent than what the apex court has set down. We are following what the government has finalised,? he pointed out. 

 Board officials will tour the city and the districts during the festive days. Complaints of violation of the sound limit can be lodged by calling the board?s control room at 23358212 or 23353913.

 Firearm haul in Gunjan case

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Police on Wednesday claimed another breakthrough in the Biswajeet Dey murder case with the recovery of a bag containing a revolver, a diary and a mobile phone from a canal beside VIP road, near Joramandir. 

 The diary belonged to Dey, who was allegedly murdered by Gunjan Ghosh, the main accused in the Roma Jhawar kidnap case. The revolver was reportedly used for the murder.

 ?We recovered a blue bag from a roadside canal near Joramandir, off Big Bazar. The spot is close to the residence of Raja, who was arrested earlier in connection with the case,? said a senior police officer. 

 The blue bag, containing the diary, revolver and the mobile phone, was found inside a larger bag, police said.

 The revolver was loaded with three bullets. Police suspect Gunjan had fired the other three bullets from the firearm to kill Dey.

 Policemen in three vans arrived at the spot around 3 pm and cordoned off the area. Raja, who was arrested a few days ago for helping Gunjan kill Dey, accompanied the cops. 

 Raja identified the spot in the canal where the bag had been thrown eight months ago. Three police divers retrieved the bag after a 30-minute search. 

 The writing in the diary was smudged as water had seeped into the bag.

 Police believe the circumstantial evidence and confessional statements are enough to nail the guilty.

 Dey was murdered on July 5 last year. His body, bearing bullet wounds, was found wrapped in a plastic sheet in a canal near Narkeldanga police station.

 Gunjan was arrested recently in connection with the Roma Jhawar abduction case. He has reportedly spilled the beans about his involvement in Dey?s murder.

 Gunjan has also been indicted for murdering Arvind Bhai, who allegedly helped him abduct Roma.

 According to police, Gunjan has confessed to shooting his partner dead after a dispute over the distribution of the ransom.

 ?Gunjan was stoical and would not admit that he was involved in any murder. Raja, however, told us about Gunjan?s involvement in the case,? said Jawed Shamim, deputy commissioner of police (eastern suburban division).

 Police are now trying to find out whether Gunjan and his accomplices were involved in any other case.

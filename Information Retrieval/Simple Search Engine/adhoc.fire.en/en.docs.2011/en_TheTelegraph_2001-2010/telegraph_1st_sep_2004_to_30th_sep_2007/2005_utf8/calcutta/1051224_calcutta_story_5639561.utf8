The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fog havoc on dawn flights

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Dense fog over Delhi disrupted flights at Calcutta airport for the second consecutive day on Friday. All morning flights to Delhi were delayed. Officials said the affected airlines included Indian, Jet Airways, Air Sahara and Air Deccan.

 The first take-off for Delhi was at 9 am. The first landing from Delhi was at 1.45 pm. Officials said the runway visibility at Delhi airport was down to 200 metres at one point. 

 Passengers of a private airline demonstrated at Calcutta airport after a Guwahati flight was diverted. Fog over Calcutta has prompted Air Sahara to bring forward the departure of its S2 306 flight by over an hour from December 26. The flight to Calcutta will now leave Mumbai at 6.15 pm.

 Party wear pitch on winter wicket

Ipsita Deb, Smita Roy Chowdhury

Ogaan 

kicked off an extravagant fashion splash with a winter wear collection including 

labels like Wild Orchid, Kavita Bhartia, Mynah, India, Horn Ok Please, Ravage, 

Jyoti Jain, Stae, Talat Kazmi, Tarina Sen and Manisha Thomas. 

 Stae?s fall-winter collection has brought with it ornamental bridal silhouettes in soft, soothing colours. The detailing, panelling and hand embroidery is intricately executed on contemporary ensembles.

 Kavita Bhartia?s line combines the rich diversity of Indian handicrafts for an essentially global look. Fabrics like silk, brocade, cotton, georgette and crepe are moulded into flattering cuts and styles in a wide array of skirts, blouses and ethnic wear.

Karuna Khaitan?s label Wild Orchid is perhaps one 

of the most striking in the store. ?For me designing is an amalgamation of line, 

form, colour and texture,? said Karuna. The collection is inspired by traditional 

garments of India and Pakistan. Basic colours like black, grey, beige and brown 

have been used against the backdrop of brighter hues for garments that fuse Indian 

and western elements.

 Ethnic chic

 The peak party days are over, but that?s no reason for you to hang up your shoes. Virgo, a boutique in Bhowanipore, has launched a line of party wear especially for the season. While the store houses various designer labels from Calcutta, Bangalore and Mumbai, it?s the in-house brand Rave that has come up with a collection to rave about.

 Designed by Ritu Sonthalia, the proprietor of Virgo and designer for Rave, the line boasts Indo-westerns, ethnics, casuals, semi-formals and formals. Salwar suits, kurtis, saris, skirts and tops made from raw silk, cotton silk, crepe, georgette and dupion fill the racks. Loads of prints, sequin work, ribbon work, crochet and zardosi jazz up the clothes. The colours are vibrant in keeping with the mood of the season ? red, purple, orange, maroon, blue and black. The range is priced between Rs 1,400 and Rs 5,000.

 To complete the ensembles are accessories including two lines of party bags from the labels Nidhi and Carry Attitude. These trendy bags in jute and silk come with embellishments that include prints, sequins and embroidery.

 Hide honcho

 Leather is good for more than just a bag, belt or jacket and Leatherworld outlets at 50, Shakespeare Sarani and Metro Plaza, have ample evidence of this.

 Started by brothers Andaleeb and Faroque Hasmi, this brand has come a long way since 1999, with its endeavour to ensure products combining comfort with the latest trends. Expandable travel bags, which can be transformed into a laptop case or overnighter, are convenient as well as fashionably styled and are priced between Rs 800 and Rs 3,500. Within this segment is a specially-crafted soft range specifically to provide comfort to those suffering from back trouble.

 The latest collection of pure leather garments and accessories comes in a variety of colours, shapes and sizes. ?Formal and casual jackets are flying off the racks. We also customise jackets within 24 hours in a range of colours and designs,? explains Andaleeb. The jackets come in the form of long coats or knee-length, short coats or the trendy mid-thigh style.

 While red seems to be the most popular colour here, pink, beige, tan, black, orange and green are also on hand. Jackets for both men and women are priced anywhere between Rs 1,600 and Rs 5,500. In the garments segment, dresses, skirts and pants seem to be making quite a splash as well, with sleeveless, slits and cut-offs being the pop picks, in fluorescent hues.

 ?The biggest mind block against buying leather is that people believe it is difficult to maintain. This is a misconception, as leather stays perfect if it is dabbed with a dry cloth and polished with a bit of coconut oil,? adds Andaleeb.

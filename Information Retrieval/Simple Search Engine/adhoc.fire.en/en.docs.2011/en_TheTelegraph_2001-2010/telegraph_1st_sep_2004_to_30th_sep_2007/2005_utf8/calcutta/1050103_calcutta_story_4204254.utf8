The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Mercury scales up in veil of mist

 OUR BUREAU

 Flights and trains were delayed on Sunday by dense fog in north India and a veil of mist over the city, brought on by moisture-laden warm air.

 The North Wind, that briefly chilled Calcutta between December 27 and New Year?s Eve, stopped blowing on Saturday, leading to a rise in temperature. The minimum temperature on Sunday was pegged at an unseasonal 16.6 degrees Celsius, four degrees above normal. The maximum temperature was 28.6 degrees, two degrees above normal.

 Met officials said the minimum temperature was expected to rise further in the next two or three days. As on December 22 ? when the minimum temperature had shot up to 20.4 degrees ? an ?anti-cyclonic? upper-air circulation had developed over the north Bay of Bengal that effected a change in the wind pattern.

 ?Because of the anti-cyclonic upper-air circulation, moisture-laden warm air is flowing into Calcutta and its adjoining areas, blocking the North Wind and raising the temperature,? an official at the regional meteorological centre in Alipore said. 

 ?The North Wind will blow again after the upper-air circulation moves further towards the Northeast, weakens and dissipates,? said an official.

 All flights from Calcutta and Delhi were delayed by at least a couple of hours owing to Sunday?s fog. 

 The first Indian Airlines flight left Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport for Mumbai at 9.30 am. 

 The Indian Airlines flight from Delhi reached Calcutta airport at 12.20 pm, against the scheduled arrival time of 9 am. The flight to Delhi from Calcutta took off at 9.50 am, instead of 7 am.

 The Jet Airways flight to Delhi, scheduled to depart from Calcutta airport at 8.05 am, left at 10.05 am. 

 The Delhi-Calcutta flight, which was to arrive at 7.30 pm, clocked in at 9.30 pm. 

 Trains from north India, too, arrived late at Howrah and Sealdah. 

 The Kalka Mail, Jodhpur Express, Shipra Express and the Mumbai-Howrah Mail via Allahabad were delayed by two hours. The New Delhi-Howrah Rajdhani Express was late by an hour, the Amritsar Mail by two hours 10 minutes and the Doon Express by four hours.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Single-roof home hunt

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 Distressed over Vaastu? Want to sell your two-room flat and move to a larger one at a better location? 

 Or, seeking to buy a flat with a choice of furniture within your budget?

 Come January 25, a one-stop housing shop will roll out the red carpet for three days at Science City to Calcutta?s home-hunters, and also strike up deals for them with leading financial institutions at affordable rates.

 ?Over the years, people buying houses have had to run from one end of the city to the other scouting for houses or visiting offices of different banks for the lowest interest rate. If these two problems were taken care of, the buyer would have to go on a hunt for a quality home d?cor firm,? said Purnendu Kundu, one of the organisers of the fair. 

 Kundu, along with partners Amit Roy and Anjan Chakraborty, has decided to bring together under one roof all resources related to the purchase of a house or apartment at the Science City fair. 

 ?Other housing fairs have been held in Calcutta of late, but none this big or comprehensive,? Kundu claimed.

 The major building companies of Calcutta, most of the nationalised and foreign banks and several home d?cor companies will be participating in the fair.

 ?The venue of the fair is a crowd-puller and we are looking forward to a great three days. We have participated in other fairs, but if everything goes according to plan, this one just might steal the show,? said Indranil De, director of Irony, manufacturers of wrought-iron furniture.

 ?There will be plenty of choice for every one at the fair. People will not only be able to buy new flats, but also sell or exchange their old flats. That apart, easy booking facilities, at a price as low as Rs 21,000, will be available at the fair,? Kundu said.

 ?Even gas stoves and other kitchen appliances can be replaced at the fair ground without a hitch. There will be banks to provide the lowest interest rates. In fact, every participant has agreed to offer special rates,? he added.

 One of the participants is the Diamond group, which is working on housing projects in Chetla, New Alipore and Behala. Satish Lakhotia, manager of Larica Estates, said that such fairs help build awareness among the masses.

 ?People who do not have an idea about the rates and quality of flats on sale can obtain valuable information at the fair,? he added.

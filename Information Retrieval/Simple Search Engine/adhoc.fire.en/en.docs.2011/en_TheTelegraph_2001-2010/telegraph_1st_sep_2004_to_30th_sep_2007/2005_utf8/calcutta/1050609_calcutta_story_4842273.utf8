 Classical melodies

 The highlight of Anirban Foundation?s 12th annual concert of Indian classical music is a vocal recital by Shruti Sadolikar (picture left). Brought up in the tradition of the legendary Jaipur-Atrauli gharana of Hindustani classical music, Sadolikar has received taalim from none other than her father and guru, Late Pt. Wamanrao Sadolikar. An extraordinarily gifted voice, matched with intensive training and rigorous discipline, has enabled her to master 20 ragas in 20 different rhythms. Presently under the tutelage of Ustad Azizuddin Khan, and a winner of numerous national awards, this evening she performs solo, accompanied by Samar Saha on the tabla and Rupashree Bhattacharya on the harmonium. Her vocal recital will be preceded by a sarod recital by Pratik Shrivastava, a promising young artiste, who will be accompanied by Biplab Bhattacharya on the tabla.

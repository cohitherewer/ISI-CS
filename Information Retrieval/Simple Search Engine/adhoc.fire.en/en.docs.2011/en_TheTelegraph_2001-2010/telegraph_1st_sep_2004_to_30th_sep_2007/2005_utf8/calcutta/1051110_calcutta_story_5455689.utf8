The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 But boats are set to sail all right

 - DISPUTE DISTURBS BUDDHA?S VENICE DREAM...

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The re-excavation of the canal system in north Calcutta almost over, the state government is preparing to operate passenger vessels on the recently-developed, 43-km route between Chitpur and Kulti Gang, with arteries leading to important Circular and Metro Railway stations. 

 Government officials said the Rs 30-crore waterways project, referred to in the administrative circles as the chief minister?s ?Venice dream?, would be taken up once chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb has sorted out differences among the state agencies responsible for its implementation.

 The transport department and the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation are engaged in a dispute over the right to implement the canal transportation project. ?Redoing the canal system figures at the top of our list of priorities,? asserted Deb. He, along with housing minister Goutam Deb, has started discussions in this regard with officials of the Housing and Infrastructure Development Corporation and the irrigation and public health engineering departments.

 ?It?s a four-in-one project involving water supply, transportation, canal bank development and environment improvement. We have to clear the confusion without delay and start working on canal navigability,? stated the chief secretary.

 The government is planning to award 30-year contracts to one or more of the three short-listed companies on a build-operate-transfer basis. 

 The companies would be responsible for properly developing the route, arranging for commercial exploitation of land on either bank, procuring and operating the vessels and putting in place overbridges, jetties and security systems. 

 In return, the companies will be allowed to keep the profit made by operating the ferry service and allowing the plots on the banks to be exploited commercially. Money made through billboards, entertainment-amusement parks, cafeterias, joggers? path and gardens would also accrue to the companies. A committee, headed by minister Deb, has been formed to oversee the utilisation of lands along the canal.

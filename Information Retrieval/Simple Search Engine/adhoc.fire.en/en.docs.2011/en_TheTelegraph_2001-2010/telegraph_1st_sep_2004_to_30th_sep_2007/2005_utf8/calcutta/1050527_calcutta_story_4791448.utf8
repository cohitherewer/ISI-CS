 Math show-stealer in CBSE success

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The success rate in the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) Class X examinations, the results of which were declared on Thursday evening, brought smiles to the faces of most students and school authorities.

 With most affiliated schools recording a clean sheet and mathematics emerging the ?show-stealer? ? many institutions reported an ?unexpected number? of students with 99 per cent ? there was some cause for cheer.

 City schools reported that along with math, what had helped push the aggregate past the 90 per cent mark were the science subjects and social studies. The one thing to take a beating ? on the comparative scale, of course ? was the English paper.

 ?We are analysing the trends but a clearer picture will only emerge on Friday,? said Anjali Razdan, principal, Lakshmipat Singhania Academy.

 Some of the top scorers of the day were Abhishek Mitra of Birla High School (Boys) and Adrita Guha of Mahadevi Birla Girls? High School, with 94 per cent each, Shrey Trivedi and Avirup Saha of Apeejay School, and Ankit Bhura of Lakshmipat Singhania Academy, all with 91 per cent. The topper at Birla High School (Girls) was Neha Dugar, with 89.6 per cent.

 ?There may be others who may have done as well or even better, and that will only be known after the results are studied thoroughly,? an official said late on Thursday.

 At Kendriya Vidyalaya, which has nearly 45 schools in and around Calcutta, the success rate was high, with mathematics doing the star turn, followed by social studies and the sciences.

 K.K. Dubey, senior official at Kendriya Vidyalaya, said: ?We are happy with the brilliant performance of some of our schools.? The success rate was 97 per cent at both Ballygunge Kendriya Vidyalaya and Kendriya Vidyalaya-II, Salt Lake.

 Playing party-pooper were the marks in the language paper. ?I am not at all happy with our marks in English. They could have been much better. We will try and analyse the reasons why,? said Rita Chatterjee, principal, Apeejay School.

 A number of principals also spoke of a meeting with CBSE officials in Delhi in the near future to find out ways to ensure a better performance in English next year.

 ?We want to ascertain whether this is a national trend or whether only Calcutta schools have suffered,? said a school principal.

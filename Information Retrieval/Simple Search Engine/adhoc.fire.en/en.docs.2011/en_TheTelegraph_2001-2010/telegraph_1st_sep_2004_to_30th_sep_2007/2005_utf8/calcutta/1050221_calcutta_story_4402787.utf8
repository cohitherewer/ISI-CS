 Of reading and readiness

 - Educating 

the educator on learning stages

 NISHA LAHIRI

 ?The proof of the pudding is in the eating?? 

 That was the theme of an exhibition at Loreto Teacher Training Centre (TTC), titled Let?s Start at the Very Beginning, part of TTC?s 50th year anniversary celebrations. And the star of the show was Madrassa Tayebiah, in Surat. 

 The TTC, which opened on January 23, 1955, is marking its golden jubilee with a series of events this year. First up was a seminar on educating the educator, followed by the exhibition, organised in association with Loreto Sealdah, for five days, at Loreto TTC. 

 The exhibition, on teaching pre-schoolers, then shifted to the Town Hall for three days. The exhibition was about TTC methods in action, with a view of the project work related to learning, with special reference to reading readiness. The aim was to hit home the fact that there are stages of development. These days, children are being made to learn things when they?re not ready, says Ayesha Das, principal, TTC. 

 ?The woman who runs the madarsa in Surat, Mrs Nuruddin, and myself, were in the second graduating batch of the TTC. She still practises what she learnt then, in her school. The problem is, people these days are trying to teach two-year-olds what is meant for four-year-olds. There are phases of learning, and you shouldn?t force things on a child.?

 Part of the exhibition was enlarged photographs of toddlers and teachers at work in the madarsa classroom. At the Surat school, parents are interviewed when the child is 15 months old ? not so the child can get admission (the age to start school is three), but to prevent parents from admitting their child into school at that tender age.

 ?When people see a classroom with lovely things, they say ?how sweet? or ?so pretty?. But they don?t understand that when it comes to toddlers, every object has significance and is used in the learning process. Even if a child is playing with a doll and pretending to cook, they?re learning. Parents should let their children make their own decisions.?

 To help teachers from government schools understand, there were helpers explaining the exhibition in Hindi, English and Bengali. ?A lot of teachers did drop in, and appreciated what we were trying to say. But I wish more had come. There weren?t enough,? signs off Das.

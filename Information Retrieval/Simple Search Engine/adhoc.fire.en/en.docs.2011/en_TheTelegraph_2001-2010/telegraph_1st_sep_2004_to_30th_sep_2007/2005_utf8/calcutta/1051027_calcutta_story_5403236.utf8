 - Diwali exception: Wednesday release for Bollywood blockbusters

 John Abraham and Akshay Kumar in Priyadarshan?s Garam Masala: Early arrival

 The storm after the lull or the boom after the bust ? call it what you will, but forget Fridays. It?s all happening next Wednesday.

 This Diwali, Bollywood, boasting no big release in recent weeks, is coming with all guns blazing. Sixteen stars will hit the big screens ? 16 multiplex ones in the city ? and they are in such a mad rush that they can?t wait till Friday the 4th.

 Marking a first of sorts in Indian cinema, not one but three films will hit the halls on Wednesday, November 2. Of the three, two are Priyadarshan movies ? the John Abraham-Akshay Kumar comedy Garam Masala and the Salman Khan-Kareena Kapoor emotional drama Kyon Ki? ? and the other is David Dhawan?s comic multi-starrer Shaadi No. 1 starring Sanjay Dutt, Fardeen Khan, Soha Ali Khan, Esha Deol and more.

 And how are the multiplexes managing the screen-juggling act? Says 89 Cinemas (Swabhumi) general manager Prashant Srivastava: ?Had it been just one new Wednesday release (Kyon Ki...), we could have just cut short a weak film and stuck to the usual programming. But with all three films, we have had to keep the coming week?s programming to just five days (till Tuesday).?

 By unveiling their films 48 hours early, producers are maximising their chances at the box-office. ?They are going for a five-day first weekend and a nine-day first week,? says Aroon Sharma, distribution head of INOX Movies, handling Garam Masala.

 And this nine-day first week would cover two movie-going peaks: Diwali and Id.

 ?This practice is common in the US and UK, where they make the most of a holiday period. Here, with Id following within a week of Diwali, business should flourish,? adds Sharma.

 The box-office performance of Diwali releases in previous years also has a lot to do with the three new biggies bringing forward their release dates.

 Says trade analyst Taran Adarsh from Mumbai: ?Almost all films released in the Diwali weeks in the past 10 years have done well. Last year, of the four releases, Veer-Zaara, Aitraaz and Mughal-e-Azam emerged big winners. This year, too, all three films should open big.?

No wonder the city multiplexes are opening advances this weekend itself. ?More than half of the total shows will be taken up by the three new movies,? reveals Subhashish Ganguly, general manager of INOX (City Centre). ?The Diwali week should be a repeat of the record footfalls we have had during Puja, where people came to watch movies in hordes even on weekdays.?

 And to cash in on this big Bollywood bang, the plexes are charging weekend prices on weekdays. So, if the new movies go house-full on the first five days (Wednesday to Sunday), producers will recover a major percentage of their costs.

 The one casualty of the mid-week craze could be Rituparno Ghosh?s Antarmahal. After a high-profile premiere on Friday, October 28, its first-week reign could be cut short in just five days once the Bollywood brigade takes over. ?The number of shows a day of Antarmahal will come down Wednesday onwards and that may affect its prospects,? admits Ganguly from INOX (City Centre).

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 The construction of the Taratala flyover is no doubt adding manifold to the Behala traffic pandemonium. It does not require a regular on the stretch to realise the mammoth magnitude of the menace. At a stone?s throw from the crossing, there is a big boggy depression almost like an archaeological excavation site. With the rains not too far away, the road stretch is heading towards a state which will only be about a shade better than a paddy field swamped with water. By the time the flyover is complete, the authorities can well begin paddy cultivation in the inundated stretch below the flyover. That might provide livelihood to the encroachers who have already set up shanties beneath the elevated roadway. Hats off to those patient souls who pass through the sickening stretch every day. 

 Arjun Chaudhuri,

 Mohesh Chaudhuri Lane. 

 A few weeks back, I was travelling by Bibhuti Express from Varanasi to Howrah. The train stopped at Jhajha station for almost an hour due to some mechanical problem. One of my co-passengers, a girl, spotted a youth taking her picture with his cell phone. As soon as she protested the man ran away. Probably, such crimes are increasing these days. It may be because the victims don?t lodge complaints with the police and dismiss the incidents as trivial. Police should take the complaints seriously. 

 Sourish Misra, 

 Salt Lake. 

 In the past, people have even lost their lives after falling into open manholes. Even the occasional seasonal shower waterlogs the bylanes. The civic authorities should replace all the stolen manhole lids before monsoon. Also, can?t the covers be designed with a latch or lock so that only the civic authorities can remove them for maintenance? 

 Bhupen Bose,

 Dum Dum Park. 

 Recently, while travelling in the Rajdhani, I was shocked to notice how a bunch of young Bengali girls flattered the ticket checker into illegally confirming their tickets. They said a few nice words and followed him around the compartment. The whole incident was extremely shameful. The corrupt official pocketed Rs 500 for a berth from each of the girls. Surprise checks should be conducted and such corrupt officials penalised.

 Raffhat Mir,

 Elliot Road. 

 Revenue stamps and money order forms are not available in all post offices in the city. The shortage is not prevalent in the other metros. What is the reason for the short-supply here? 

 T.R. Anand,

 Budge Budge.

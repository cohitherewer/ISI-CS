The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 10+2 order to be in place this year

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 A day after the Supreme Court set June 10 as the deadline for all education boards to declare the results of their 10+2 examinations, the state government said on Thursday that it would comply with the verdict from the current academic year.

 ?A copy of the order will, hopefully, reach us by Thursday. Bengal has been exempted this year from following the deadline, but we will ensure that the results of the Higher Secondary (HS) examinations 2005 are declared by June 10,? school education minister Kanti Biswas said.

 The government is finalising a comprehensive plan for rescheduling not just the school-leaving examinations, but also the undergraduate and postgraduate examinations of all state universities. 

 ?Much before the Supreme Court order, we had initiated the process of announcing HS results in June,? Biswas told Metro.

 Till last year, the HS council used to announce the results in July-end, putting in a spot several students seeking admissions to universities/institutes in other states.

 Most education boards outside Bengal announce the results of their 10+2 examinations in June.

 The government has lined up a series of interactive sessions to formulate a policy on rescheduling all major examinations, from Madhyamik to the postgraduate.

 The proposal for advancing the school-leaving examinations has been under consideration since the state higher education department had stressed the need to advance the undergraduate and postgraduate exams. 

 That could be possible only if the HS and Madhyamik are held early. ?All these exams are linked to each other,? explained a senior official of the state higher education department. 

 For instance, Madhyamik and HS dates cannot overlap, as many schools are used as venues for both. Moreover, the answer-scripts of both exams are evaluated by almost the same set of examiners.

 Similarly, the undergraduate examinations of Calcutta University cannot overlap with the HS, which is held in several colleges. 

 And the schedule for post-graduate examinations depends wholly on that of undergraduate ones.

 The West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education had recently organised a string of workshops, where the following proposals had emerged:

 Like in most other states, 

 Madhyamik and HS can be held together 

 The Madhyamik curriculum 

 should be based on only what is taught in Class X and the 

 HS syllabi should comprise what is taught in Class XII

 The HS course may be split 

 into semesters

 Madhyamik and HS answer-scripts 

 should be checked by different groups of examiners

 The HS exam may precede 

 Madhyamik, as that will help universities advance the dates 

 of their exams.

 ?We will soon call meetings to discuss the proposals,? said an official.

 The HS examinations this year start from March 22 (10 days earlier than last year) and Madhyamik begins on February 24 (a week in advance than the previous year).

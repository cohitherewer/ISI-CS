 Visual rules audio racks

 - Cost and convenience score in DVD-VCD demand spurt

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Frank Zappa Live at The Pier in New York City, Edward Fox in The Day of The Jackal, Satyajit Ray?s Aranyer Din Ratri or maybe Denzel Washington?s Man On Fire that sparked Ek Ajnabee ? visual rules audio racks, right?

 Till two or three years ago, one would step into a music store for, well, music. That?s not standard practice anymore. Sight is ruling over sound with DVDs and view CDs nudging music software all but off the racks.

 ?The visual format now constitutes over 47 per cent of our sales pie, compared to just 5 per cent five years back,? admits Chetan Arora, regional manager of MusicWorld.

 Seeing the sales synergy, the chain?s Park Street mother store ? the country?s highest-grossing music retail outlet ? has started stocking DVD players and related hardware.

 Prices of both hardware and software crashing is just one of the reasons why the home video concept has gained momentum.

 ?With the mushrooming of multiplexes, going to the movies has become far more expensive and rather than spending over Rs 500 for a single cinema outing, people are picking up their favourite DVDs for keeps,? says Gautam Jatia of Landmark.

 The Lord Sinha Road outlet anchoring Emami Shoppers? City has seen the visual format catapult from ?just 5 per cent in 1999 to over 50 per cent at present?.

 Access to a wide range of movie titles ? Hollywood, Hindi and regional ? has also tilted the scales in favour of the video format.

 While one can now pick up a DVD of The Great Escape or a Ritwik Ghatak masterpiece, even the latest Bollywood releases come to the racks in a jiffy.

 ?Producers realise the home video is a huge market and to pre-empt piracy, they are not waiting too long to launch the DVD-VCD format,? explains Sidharth Pansari of Crossword. In the music section of the Elgin Road store, ?over 60 per cent of sales? now come from DVDs and VCDs.

 to scout maybe for the latest U2 studio album, a Beatles bouquet you didnt have or a re-mastered Hemanta classic.

 quot;Its one of the cheaper forms of quality entertainment for todays nuclear families hard-pressed for time to go out to the movies. Besides, people compile their own libraries and love to possess big titles, quot; Pansari adds.

 The paradigm shift also has a lot to do with the shrinking audio format, triggered by among others, FM radio and the iPod. quot;CD sales have clearly been hit after iPod became a rage, with downloading from the Net and borrowing software the order of the day, quot; acknowledges Jatia. He fears CD sales might slow down to just a trickle five years on, and music stores could well resemble Internet parlours for bottling songs onto iPods.

 Arora agrees core music outlets might have to do things a touch differently in future, but pins his hope for the time being on the burgeoning growth of the international music video segment.

 quot;Watching a DVD of a rock concert or a hundred violas of a symphony orchestra in unison at home is the next best thing to being there, and with home theatres getting cheaper every month, the demand for software is bound to spiral, quot; adds Arora.

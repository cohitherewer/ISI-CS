The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Clarion call to clean festive fervour

 - PANDALS? CONCERN OVER CONSTRAINTS ALLAYED

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Manicktalla Chaltabagan Lohapatty, the model puja for 2004

 Even the spacious auditorium of Rotary Sadan did not have enough elbow room for the hordes of puja organisers who had responded to the call for entries to the third edition of the CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja award. 

 In 2004, about 140 entries were received and 115 had qualified for participation. This year, about 100 of them were back, while more than 60 new pujas registered for the screening. 

 The galloping popularity of the award made the organisers promise to increase the count of participants in 2005. ?Other than the 115 participants of last year, we will take in some more,? it was announced.

 From the start, it was made clear how True Spirit Puja is different from the run-of-the-mill competition. ?This is not a contest, but a clarion call to let every citizen enjoy the festival in a better way,? the compere kept repeating as he took the puja organisers through the rules of participation. 

 The chief categories of consideration remain the same ? concern for safety and civic commitment through traffic and crowd control, medical aid, fire safety, environmental awareness and proper electricity use. Proof of other ways of caring for neighbours and pandal-hoppers fetches bonus points in the scorecards of the judges.

 The pat on the back ? the model puja is crowned with Rs 50,000; two five-star pujas get Rs 25,000 each; three four-star pujas receive Rs 15,000, and 10 three-star and two-star pujas get Rs 10,000 and Rs 5,000 respectively.

 Once the audio-visual presentation was over, an open house was declared. Immediately, the auditorium came to life, with a volley of queries from the organisers who had sat through the one-hour session. 

 ?We want to keep an ambulance to tend to the sick but do not have the space in our alley. Space is also the reason why our toilets are some way off from the pandal. Will we be penalised for that?? asked a representative of Falguni Sangha in Ballygunge, which got a two-star ranking in 2004.

 Other organisers, too, came forward to voice their constraints. ?We have a Sulabh complex in nearby Deshapriya Park. Must we build another toilet?? asked a representative of Trikon Park puja. ?We got a ?more-or-less ok? comment from the judges last year. How can we improve our showing?? was the concern voiced by the president of the Putiary Club puja.

 Fire services representative A. Sarkar was urged to issue a certificate to prove to the True Spirit judges that they had participated in a fire drill. 

 The CESC representatives on stage were asked not to penalise organisers for faulty connections if their representatives dropped by during a preliminary check. 

 Concern for Calcutta and Power FM are also involved in the festive endeavour. 

 The message was clear. No inch will be spared as the competition intensifies with every passing year. But since the aim is a more organised and people-friendly festival, no one is complaining.

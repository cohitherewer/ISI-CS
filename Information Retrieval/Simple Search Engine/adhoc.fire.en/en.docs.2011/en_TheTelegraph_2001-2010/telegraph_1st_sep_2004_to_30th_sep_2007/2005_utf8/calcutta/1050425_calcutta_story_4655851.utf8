The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 On April 16, a friend of mine was waiting for a bus on route S-19 at the state bus depot opposite Jadavpur University?s main gate (known as 8B bus stand). She found at least half-a-dozen buses on route S-31 parked in the depot, hardly leaving much space for buses on other routes. Suddenly, an S-19 left the depot from the rear exit while the passengers were waiting for the bus for almost 20 minutes at the other end. The staff at the depot office were rude and didn?t clarify as to why no announcement was made that the bus was leaving from the other exit. Are passengers expected to shuttle between the two exits guessing which one the bus would take out of the depot?

 Aloke Surana,

 Baguiati. 

 Hawkers dump garbage in an enclosure opposite Ashubabur Bazar in Paikpara which often attracts cattle. A similar scene meets the eye at the dumps near Purabi cinema and next to Rajabazar tram depot. The cattle often block a part of the road along the vats. Authorities should either fence off the dumps or at least make sure that the garbage is removed daily.

 Bhupendra Nath Bose,

 Dum Dum Park. 

 Taxis are parked on the footpaths on Marquis Street, while two-wheelers block pavements of Chowringhee Lane. Advertising signboards placed on the footpaths add to the pedestrians? woes. Can something be done about it?

 M. Wali, 

 Howrah.

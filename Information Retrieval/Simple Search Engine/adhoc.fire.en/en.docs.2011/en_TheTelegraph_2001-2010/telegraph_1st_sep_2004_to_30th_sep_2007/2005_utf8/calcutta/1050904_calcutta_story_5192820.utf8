 Bday blast at hookah haunt

 Smouldering vanilla hookahs and shimmering prawn cocktails. Charging Balmoral cigars and cappuccinos with a whiff of cinnamon. Trickling Irish cream and sluggish chocolate mousse... 

 Shisha celebrated its second birthday on Thursday night in style. 

 With the bash spilling over from the lounge to the revamped Grain of Salt and the tranquil Platinum Lounge, the entire fifth floor of the 22, Camac Street address reverberated with the buoyant spirits of the bday guests.

 Choosing a weeknight to avoid the weekend rush, the party was limited only to regular revellers at the hookah haunt. And that was more than a handful, since Shisha has easily been one of the most-frequented nightspots in the two years that its doors have been flung open. 

 The invitees started pouring in around 10, but it was only around midnight that the wooden floors started throbbing with infectious energy and the music switched from the Buddha Bars to the Bunty Aur Bablis.

 And they all came in ? models, restaurateurs, consular crowds ? to make it a night to remember. The Chivas Regals and Jack Daniels in hand, the Paneer Tikkas and Pepper Prawns in demand, they wished the managers, greeted the waiters and patted the deejays, egging them on to more glorious Shisha nights ahead.

 The birthday greetings over, it was time to grab a bite at the special midnight buffet, which also marked the opening of the revamped lifestyle restaurant ? Grain of Salt in its new avatar.

 With elaborate cold cuts and salads in place and an intimidating array of main-course items, it was the live Mongolian counter that was a clincher and the hub of all gastronomical activity. While the wild peach and lychee ice-creams were inviting, it was the Shisha birthday cake that found maximum takers.

 Before rekindling the high spirits post-dinner, many preferred a stroll across to the adjacent Platinum Lounge for a puff of the Cuban cigars and a sip of the coffee. But it wasnt long before everyone got back to the epicentre of excitement ? the modest little Shisha floor.

 And it was time to let go. Even as the familiar silhouettes shone and swung on the red walls, like any other night, it was time to raise a toast ? to the whole new generation of party people born out of the looking glass named Shisha.

 - Delhi board sets up panel for regular co-curricular events

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 City schools affiliated to the Delhi-based Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations will soon have an organised and uniform system in place to encourage co-curricular activities among students. 

 The council, offering the Indian Certificate for Secondary Education (ICSE) and Indian School Certificate (ISC) examinations, has for the first time decided to formulate concrete policies on measures to provide necessary opportunities to the students to develop their skills in sports, performing arts and other such activities. 

 ?Most schools affiliated to the council, especially Anglo-Indian schools, had always laid emphasis on all-round development of their students,? F. Fanthome, council chief executive, told Metro from Delhi on Monday. 

 ?With this aim, they are organising programmes on a regular basis to encourage students? participation in co-curricular activities. But this is the first time that the council has set up a committee exclusively responsible for framing policies to promote co-curricular activities,? he elaborated.

 Till now, a uniform pattern on co-curricular activities was lacking. ?Now that we have the committee, the schools will be able to plan the programmes in a more organised manner,? the official said. 

 The new committee, which will start functioning from the current academic session, will be a national-level body of members of the council. 

 ?It will function like the other existing committees of the council, which are responsible for framing policies on important issues, like conducting examinations, publishing results, framing syllabi and handling financial matters,? Fanthome added.

 Sources said the ICSE council is one of the few educational boards to have formed a national-level panel to oversee co-curricular activities in its affiliated institutions. 

 The policies framed by this committee will focus on measures to provide suitable opportunities to every student with the potential to excel in a particular co-curricular activity. 

 ?The committee will determine ways to identify talent. It will also explore ways to enable the selected students get exposure in the world outside,? Fanthome said. 

 For this purpose, the committee will organise events at the state and national level on a regular basis among its schools. 

 Apart from sports, music ? both vocal and instrumental ? dance, drama, debates, creative writing and poetry writing, the board aims also to encourage students? participation in the events. The council will also introduce a system of awarding students who excel in co-curricular activities.

 Appreciating the schools? move for extending their support to the council in implementing all its major decisions successfully so far, Fanthome said: ?We are happy that many of our schools are already organising debates, creative writing and poetry writing competitions and sport meets on a regular basis.?

 During the four-day meet of Anglo-Indian school heads in Calcutta last week, the council chief had requested the schools to lay more emphasis on activity-based education.

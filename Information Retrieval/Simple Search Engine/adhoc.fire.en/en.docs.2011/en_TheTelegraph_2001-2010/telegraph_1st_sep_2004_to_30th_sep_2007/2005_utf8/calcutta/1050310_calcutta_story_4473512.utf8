The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Behind the bar

The sun has started blazing in full swing and the 

temperature is soaring by the day. While chilling out in this weather means guzzling 

gallons of beer, for those not into hard liquor this is just the season to cool 

off with some smoothies and sherbet. 

And with Holi knocking at the door, whipping up some 

thandai at home seems to be the right thing to do. In fact, you can also 

innovate on the traditional thandai and badam sherbet and give an 

almond twist to the drinks. 

To make any drink with almond you would require almond 

milk. You can either pick it up from supermarkets or try your hand at preparing 

some at home. Once that?s done, combine it with your favourite summer fruit to 

whip up a real cooler.

Almond Milk

Ingredients: 1/3 cup blanched almonds, 2/3 

cup boiling water

Method: Soak the blanched almonds in the boiling 

hot water for 30 minutes. Using an electric blender, blitz the almond and water 

into a fine paste. 

Strain the almond paste through a double-layer muslin 

or cheese cloth, squeezing the almond paste well to get most of the almond milk 

out. 

The milk can be combined with other ingredients to 

make a variety of drinks.

RASPBERRY ALMOND SMOOTHIE

Ingredients (to serve four): 2 cups almond 

milk, one 12-ounce packet of frozen raspberries, 2 medium bananas cut into chunks, 

2-3 tablespoons honey, 1/2 teaspoon almond extract, 12 fresh raspberries (optional), 

8 whole blanched almonds (optional)

Method: Combine almond milk, frozen raspberries, 

bananas, honey and almond extract in a blender and whirl until smooth. Pour into 

four tall glasses and garnish with fresh raspberries and whole almonds.

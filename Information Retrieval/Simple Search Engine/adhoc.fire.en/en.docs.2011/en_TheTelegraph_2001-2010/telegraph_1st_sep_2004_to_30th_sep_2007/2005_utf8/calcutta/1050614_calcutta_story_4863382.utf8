 State of the union, in black-and-white

 After a visually rich period piece, Rituparno Ghosh has got busy with a modern day tale of marital infidelity. Reshmi Sengupta reports from the sets of his black-and-white drama Dosar, starring Prosenjit and Konkona Sen Sharma

 Have Bengali cine-goers snipped their bond with black-and-white cinema? Or, does a whiff of nostalgia still tug at their heartstrings every time an Uttam-Suchitra film flickers on the screen?

 Rituparno Ghosh is certain it does. Having slipped into a retro mood with his 12th feature film Dosar, the film-maker has decided to explore the story of marital infidelity, starring Prosenjit and Konkona Sen Sharma, in shades of black and white. 

 ?I feel Bengalis have a nostalgic connection with black-and-white films. It would be interesting to explore whether the audiences still want to see black-and-white, and if so, why. I am very excited,? he gushes, as the crew gets ready on the sets at a Jhowtala Road address. 

 ?The shift from black-and-white to colour has been compulsive. It wasn?t a technological option for us. And after the advent of colour, black-and-white is not used as a literary device anymore,? he reasons. 

 Things become a little abstract with black-and-white, feels the man steering the camera. Back home after working on Shaad Ali?s peppy and colourful Bunty Aur Babli, Abhik Mukherjee is visibly excited with the new challenge. 

 ?I am taking it as stylisation in photography. And it?s a lot easier for me because I have an academic background. Once you know how to see things in black-and-white, colour becomes just an additional tool,? says he, referring to his FTII Pune days. 

 ?Dosar is mainly an indoor drama; there?s not much contribution from nature. In terms of black-and-white, I see it as a discovery of something new in the husband-wife relationship. The darkness could imply what the characters want to hide and the lit-up zone, their positive facets,? feels Abhik. 

 As Rituparno oversees the props being arranged in a small room on the second floor, an unkempt Prosenjit lies stretched out on the bed, a dark stitch mark running across his forehead. 

 ?The make-up is done a shade darker than usual for a black-and-white film,? says Prosenjit, having worked in several of them at the start of his career. 

 ?I am a senior executive and the film is about my relationship with my wife. The entire story happens in a span of 40-45 days. I am badly injured after an accident and so, I am in bed throughout. I am shown standing in perhaps only one scene,? he adds.

?This is a very difficult thing to do, because he would barely move his neck in some scenes,? elaborates Rituparno.

 Dosar was initially conceived as two stories running simultaneously with Prosenjit and Konkona in double roles. But as the first script shaped up, the director felt it deserved a separate treatment. ?Maybe we can work on the second story later as a part-two kind of thing,? muses Rituparno.

 But his tale is more than just the typical triad of husband, wife and the other woman (played by Chandrayee Ghosh). The husband has managed to survive in Dosar, but the mishap has claimed the other woman in his life. So, here?s the wife confronting a breach in trust, looking after an injured husband and chased by the shadow of his lady love.

 ?My film addresses the concept of infidelity more than infidelity itself. It?s trying to redefine infidelity, re-analysing the concept. But it?s a love story and very much 21st century? Konkona is a modern Bengali girl with traditional values,? explains Rituparno. 

 ?For me, it?s about how infidelity affects a relationship,? says Konkona. ?It?s a bizarre kind of a situation and then they have to live with each other.? In a sari, bindi and bun, many on the sets feel Konkona is a throwback to her mother Aparna Sen. The theme of infidelity had also kept her busy in Mumbai a month ago, when she was shooting for Rajat Kapoor?s Mixed Doubles.

 But the two films are ?very, very different? from each other, she stresses. ?In Mixed Doubles, it has been 10 years since our marriage (with Ranvir Shorey) and though we love each other we started drifting apart,? says Konkona, at the end of the first day?s shoot. 

 The coming weeks will find the rest of the cast, comprising Chandrayee Ghosh, Shankar Chakraborty, Pallavi Chatterjee, Parambrata Chatterjee, Saswata Chatterjee, Tota Roy Chowdhury and Mithu Chakraborty, facing the camera for Dosar.

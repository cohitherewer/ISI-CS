 Wall looms over slum

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A portion of the wall that collapsed in the West Port area on Wednesday evening, killing 11 people and injuring five others, still poses a threat to the lives of the residents of the adjacent slum.

 Part of the wall, which is about 25 ft high and belongs to an abandoned warehouse, collapsed half-an-hour after a Nor?wester lashed the city. Nearly 200 people live in the adjacent slum.

 The 11 killed, including seven children, were all residents of the slum. Seven of the 20 shanties that made it up were destroyed in the wall collapse.

 The portion of the wall still standing is dilapidated and might collapse any time. 

 ?We have evacuated our families from the shanties and shifted them to safe places. The wall is in a dangerous state and can fall down on our shacks any time,? said Md Chottu, a dweller of a shanty that escaped damage on Wednesday. 

 A permanent shift to a safer place is not an option for the slum-dwellers. ?Where can we go? We are all casual workers and would find it hard to earn our daily bread elsewhere. Leaving the place is out of the question,? Chottu added.

 He and his neighbours spent the day waiting for the corpses of their friends and relatives, and inquiring anxiously about the injured.

 According to the SSKM Hospital authorities, the conditions of the injured were ?stable, but still serious?.

 Looming large over the sorrow and worries of the slum-dwellers is the killer wall. Their only solace is an indication by the chief minister that they might be compensated.

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee told reporters at the Writers? Buildings: ?Let them apply for compensation first. We will consider their request.?

 The chief minister added that MLA from Garden Reach Md Amin would visit the site for inspection. 

 Police said that no immediate action was possible in the case. ?We will try to trace the owner of the abandoned warehouse. No case can be lodged now, as those people were living illegally and the warehouse was abandoned. We will launch an inquiry into the matter,? stated Ranvir Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters). 

 Local MP Ram Pyare Ram asserted that shifting was the only option for the slum-dwellers. ?We will try to help them,? he promised.

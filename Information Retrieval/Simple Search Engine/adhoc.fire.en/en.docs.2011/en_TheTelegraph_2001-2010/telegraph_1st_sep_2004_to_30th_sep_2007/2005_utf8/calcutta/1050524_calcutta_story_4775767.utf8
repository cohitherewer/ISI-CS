 Dawn fire destroys bookshops

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Books worth lakhs were reduced to ashes and at least nine persons had a narrow escape as a fire engulfed the heritage College Street Coffee House address, home to a number of bookshops, around 3.30 am on Monday .

 The fire broke out on the ground floor and spread to the first and second floors. The blaze was brought under control at 6.35 am.

 By then, the outlets of three major book companies had all but been reduced to ashes. The fire services department lodged an FIR against the building?s leaseholder, Susanta Basu. 

 Fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee said: ?I have asked the deputy commissioner (north) to arrest the man. Our department has been telling him for quite some time to repair the building and replace the dangerous wiring. A fire had broken out in the building last year, too.?

 According to the minister, the fire was caused by a short-circuit in the feeder box. ?The building has a mesh of wires that dangle dangerously on the ground floor.?

 Chuckervertty and Chatterjee lost books worth at least Rs 3 lakh. UN Dhur and Sons, and Sen and Roy are the other two firms that suffered losses.

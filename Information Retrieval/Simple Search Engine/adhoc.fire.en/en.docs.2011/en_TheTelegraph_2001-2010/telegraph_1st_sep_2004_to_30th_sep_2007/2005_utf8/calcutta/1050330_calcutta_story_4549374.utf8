The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Temple expulsion over tease uproar

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 The Iskcon temple authorities at Mayapur on Tuesday expelled three workers for assaulting a group of visitors from Calcutta, including a woman, on the premises on Sunday. But not before holding the injured woman responsible for the incident.

 ?They (the three accused) were casual workers engaged in our goshala (cowshed). We have got rid of them, they will never be allowed to return to the temple,? said Ramesh Das, spokesperson for the temple run by the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. ?They will never be allowed to hold jobs in any of our organisations.?

 On the evening of March 27, the three workers beat up city dentist Dhruv Dubey, his driver Anil Upadhyay and Dubey?s aunt Ratna Mishra when they protested the harassment of Mishra?s daughter and her friend by the trio. 

 The temple authorities said their inquiry found that the three, who had manhandled Dubey and others, were not the ones who had harassed the two teenage girls.

 The men who actually hounded the girls were yet to be identified. Mishra mistook one of the three expelled workers for the molester and slapped him in public, Iskcon spokesman Das said, adding that this provoked the three to assault the visitors.

 ?The tormentors had fled the spot when the visitors protested. Mishra, enraged by the lewd comments, mistook one of the three goshala workers for one of the teasers and slapped him in front of many visitors. This infuriated the men, who attacked Mishra and her relatives,? Das said.

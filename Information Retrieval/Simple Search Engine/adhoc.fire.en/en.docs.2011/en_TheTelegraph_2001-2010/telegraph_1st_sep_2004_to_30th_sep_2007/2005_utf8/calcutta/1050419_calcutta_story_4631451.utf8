 HC blow for online 

lottery

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court on Monday dismissed an appeal by Sikkim State Lotteries director L.P. Barhungpa against an order of a trial judge, allowing police to continue proceedings against his company. 

 Following Monday?s order by a division bench, city police will have the right to resume its drive against the single-digit lottery conducted by the Sikkim government.

 Appearing for the petitioner, advocate Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya argued that though a division bench of the high court had upheld the right of the police to investigate the affairs of online lotteries, the Supreme Court had stayed all proceedings against agents of online lotteries. He prayed for a similar order.

 Additional government pleader (AGP) Debasish Kar Gupta submitted that the director of the West Bengal State Lotteries had lodged a complaint against Barhungpa, alleging that the his company was violating the Lottery Regulation Act, 1998.

 ?Sikkim State Lotteries is conducting single-digit lottery and more than one draw is being held in a day in violation of the Act,? Kar Gupta stated.

 The AGP informed the court that Barhungpa had demanded quashing of the proceedings drawn against him on the basis of the complaint lodged by his West Bengal counterpart.

 ?The order of the Supreme Court is not applicable in the case of the director of the Sikkim lottery,? he argued. 

 The division bench of Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice Ashok Kumar Ganguly held that the Supreme Court order was based on pleas by the agents of online lotteries and not by their directors.

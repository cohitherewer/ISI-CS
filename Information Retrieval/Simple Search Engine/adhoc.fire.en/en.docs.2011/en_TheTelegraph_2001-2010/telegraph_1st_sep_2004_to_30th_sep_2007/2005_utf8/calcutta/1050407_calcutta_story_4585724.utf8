 Cameron Diaz: A class of her own

 Adam Sandler, Hilary Duff, Will Smith, Usher, Avril Lavigne, Romeo, Raven, SpongeBob SquarePants and Tony Hawk are among those who clinched coveted Kids? Choice Blimp Awards at Nickelodeon?s 18th Annual Kids? Choice Awards, featuring the hottest stars of TV, movies, music and sports, on Saturday, April 2. Kids honoured their favourites at this year?s kudos/mess fest hosted by actor Ben Stiller at UCLA?s Pauley Pavilion.

 Over 15 million kids voted in a total of 15 categories on Nick.com and via SMS, from March 7 to April 2, and for their favourite athlete, favourite book and favourite video game through a mail-in ballot in Nickelodeon Magazine. 

 The tally yielded Hilary Duff as the favourite movie actress (A Cinderella Story), and Adam Sandler as favourite movie actor (50 First Dates). The Incredibles nabbed the favourite movie award, while Will Smith scored for his voice in Shark Tale. SpongeBob SquarePants took the honours for the third time as favourite cartoon. 

 The top TV awards went to American Idol. Skateboarder Tony Hawk notched his third Blimp as favourite athlete. Usher made it as favourite male singer and for favourite song (Burn), while feisty Avril Lavigne was favourite female singer. Lemony Snicket?s A Series of Unfortunate Events was voted the best book. The Wannabe Award, bestowed on a celebrity role model, was presented to actress Queen Latifah by Halle Berry. 

 In a breathtaking Kids? Choice stunt, Donald Trump triggered a world record-setting human cannonball with his dreaded declaration ?You?re fired!? And Nick Cannon kept up colourful commentary as the skyward-soaring daredevil wowed the crowd and stayed true to tradition with the never-before-attempted feat ? landing in a net that exploded into Nickelodeon?s signature green slime.

 Jamie Foxx astounded all with his eyeball rotating for Celebrity Hidden Talent. He competed on the orange carpet, contesting with other stars? jaw-dropping demonstrations, including Cameron Diaz?s ASpeak, her special language, and Jessica Alba?s double-jointed backwards thumb. 

 In a climactic moment of mess, slime showers splashed down on a surprised Johnny Depp, drenching him from head to toe, spreading goo to host Ben Stiller. 

 Will Smith marked his first award show musical performance in three years with the debut of Switch from his upcoming album Lost and Found, in a lavish production replete with a panoply of clowns, drummers and dancers sambaing around a magnificent cotton candy machine. 

June and Koneenica: Woman power. Picture by Pabitra Das

 Two sisters are in love with the same man, but who gets him finally is just anybody?s guess. What we know is that the story has ?bits and pieces? of actress-turned-director June?s life. ?Two of my cousins fell for the same guy, though none of them has married him,? admits June, slipping behind the camera for her fourth telefilm, Tumi Je Amar.

 To be aired on ETV Bangla as part of the Shudhu Tomari Jonyo series, Tumi Je Amar stars Koneenica Banerjee and two newcomers, Shayan and Kimberline. 

 ?The younger sister and the guy study in the US. The story starts when they come home for the holidays. While the younger girl is the MTV-kind, the elder one is more the Visva-Bharati and Shesher Kabita type. I have long wanted to use Rabindrasangeet, and this time I have the chance. We have used Mor bina baje and Sakhi bhalobasha kare koye,? said June, having penned the script for the first time. 

 ?But this telefilm is also about how we tend to take the people we love for granted,? adds June, who feels telefilms provide a fine grooming ground for a budding film-maker. ?Telefilms are like a workshop for me and I will go on doing them till I start my feature film, which will be sometime at the end of this year,? she smiles.

Prince Charles: Loved to be hated

 Those of us denied an invitation to the royal wedding (so what if it?s a civic do in a petty town hall) can lick our wounds and switch on the telly. Though no channel has come forward yet to telecast the event live, being too focussed on a bat-and-ball game of the once-colonised subjects, there will be enough of the Prince of Wales on beam. 

 The History Channel is broadcasting a show titled Passions of Prince Charles on Friday at 10 pm. Shed a tear or two on reading the show synopsis ? ?After a troubled upbringing, Charles was duty-bound to marry Lady Diana Spencer and denied the union with his life-long love Camilla Parker-Bowles. This all-encompassing biography incorporates how Charles?s childhood, young adulthood, fatherhood and royal responsibility affect his passions and life choices at this time?. 

 But do save the buckets for beamtime. If Passions of Prince Charles reminds one of the Mel Gibson-directed film The Passion of the Christ, what should the wedding be called? Resurrection?

 Arrests fail to rescue teenager

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The ordeal of the parents of a teenager, who went missing from her Jadavpur residence almost three weeks ago, is far from over, despite the arrests of two of the prime suspects in the case. 

 Aparna Biswas, 14, didn?t return to her Central Park residence on the evening of January 6. Her father, Sudhir, went door-to-door looking for her for days. But it was only on January 25 that he lodged a complaint with Jadavpur police station. 

 The cops immediately swung into action and arrested two suspects. One of them, Sandip Basu of Bagha Jatin, allegedly knows where Aparna is. But that was about it. 

 Till now, neither is there any clue to the girl?s whereabouts, nor is the third suspect in the police net. 

 ?On January 24, Sandip told me that my daughter had been living with him and refused to hand her over to me. His relatives threatened me and he even warned me to move out of my house or face dire consequences,? father Sudhir said.

 ?I don?t know when I will get my daughter back,? he lamented, outside the court of the sub-divisional judicial magistrate. The arrested duo has been remanded in judicial custody till February 2.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Police mum, court frowns 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 A Calcutta High Court judge on Thursday ticked off the city police for their failure to protect a trader from extortionists ? allegedly hired by a realtor ? and for not carrying out his order in this regard.

 Justice Jayanta Biswas ordered deputy commissioner of police (south) N.R. Babu to appear before him on November 26 and explain why he had ignored an earlier order to submit a report on the case.

 ?It?s a matter of concern that police do not bother to obey a court order,? Justice Biswas observed.

 Petitioner Mohammad Nizamuddin had opened a tailoring shop on Nawab Abdur Rahman Street, in the Park Street police station area, on November 4. 

 He approached Park Street police station on being asked by local goons to pay a hefty sum for opening the shop, but officers refused to register a complaint. 

 He then contacted police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee and deputy commissioner Babu. ?The commissioner had given me a patient hearing but did not act against the offenders. Babu had advised me to either move court or meet the demands of the goons,? Nizamuddin said, while moving the petition on November 11.

 Justice Biswas had passed an order asking Babu to take action against the offenders and submit a report on November 24. But no lawyer representing police was present when the matter came up for hearing on Thursday.

 ?I think the deputy commissioner has no time to submit a report to the court. I am directing him to appear before me on November 26 and clarify his stand,? Justice Biswas said.

 Cases alleging police failure in saving traders from extortion are nothing new in the high court. On several occasions, the judiciary has had to intervene to protect traders.

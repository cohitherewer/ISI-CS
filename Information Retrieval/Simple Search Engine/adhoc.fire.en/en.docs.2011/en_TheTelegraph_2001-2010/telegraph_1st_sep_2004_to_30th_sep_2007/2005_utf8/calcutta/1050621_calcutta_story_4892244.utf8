 Plonk down your shopping bags on the table, let your kids run riot at the kiddie zone as you dig into your pizza, crunch into a chatpata chaat or slurp a smoothie.

 Burp, the food court at Forum mall, has emerged as one of the biggest hangouts in the heart of the city. Whether you want an energy boost before you start a shopping spree or some rejuvenation after a hectic day of buying, Burp has a variety of food and beverage options to spoil you.

 When we conceptualised Burp there were three criteria we kept in mind. Serving a variety of cuisines was the first on the agenda. Then came the economical prices and swank ambience, explains Ujjal, general manager, Forum.

 I think we have been able to provide shoppers with a good hangout option because sometimes we have people waiting to get a seat, he smiles.

 Address: 10/3 Elgin Road, Forum, fifth floor.

 Time: The food court is open from 11 am to 10.30 pm.

 Footfall: Despite a deluge of eating options, Burp records more than 70,000 swipes every month. Burp is located at a very convenient point. The two auditoriums in INOX have their exits opening into the food court. The aroma of food attracts people, explains Malay Ghosh Dastidar, manager, Burp.

 Food options: From south Indian bites to cheesy pizzas, Mongolian grills to Mexican delights, the mix leaves little to the imagination.

 Some of the popular picks include the exotic fare at Flaming Wok. This counter serves up steaming options like Garlic Pepper Chicken, Fire Chicken, Black Pepper Lamb and Honey and Stir Fried Mushrooms. The pocket pinch is between Rs 55 and Rs 120.

 Or check out the Arabian, Thai and Lebanese food at Ar-Han Thai. Go the Indian way at Badshahs with Tikka Kebab, Kalmi Kebab and Reshmi Kebab, besides a variety of biryani.

 The south Indian fare at Raj Veggie Point includes Cheese Onion Tomato Masala Dosa, Butter Rava Dosa and Butter Paneer Masala Dosa.

 However, if you are in a tearing hurry, rush to Pizza Hut Express, where they serve Veggie Crunch and Teekha Chicken in no time and for as low as Rs 49 upwards.

 Chatpati serves the choicest chaats like Dahi Raj Kachori Chat, Chola Kachori Dahi Chat, Chola Tikka, Dahi Tikia Chat. The other favourites here are Muli Gobi Paratha, Matar Paratha and Kachori Subji. Here, prices range between Rs 35 and Rs 50.

 Quick fix: The set-up is designed to ensure the food reaches packed tables as fast as possible. Burp was the first eatery in town to introduce swipe cards. The guests can pay the desired amount at the counter and avail of a Burp debit card. Then they just go to any food counter and pay via the debit card. This avoids unnecessary wastage of time standing at the counter to clear your cheque, adds Ghosh Dastidar.

 Competition: With other eating options in the mall, there was some apprehension about the response to the 180-seater food court, which opened on February 1, 2004.

 Oh! Calcutta and Starstruck just one floor down, however, are both destinations for a more formal, time-consuming meal.

 Conventional food options were aplenty and a food court was being set up in the mall for the first time. Very few people were aware of such a concept. But now we think adding another 150 seats would not have been a bad idea, adds Ujjal.

 Kid care: Burp provides an add-on that would tempt any exhausted parent. Kool Kidz is a safe space where children up to the age of 11 years can play, under the watchful eye of the staff at hand. The charges are Rs 60 on weekdays and Rs 75 on weekends for every hour.

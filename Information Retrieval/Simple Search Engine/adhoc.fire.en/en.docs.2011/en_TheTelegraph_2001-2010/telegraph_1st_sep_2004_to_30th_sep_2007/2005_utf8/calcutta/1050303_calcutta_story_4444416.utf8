Dabbling with two speciality cuisines and being equally 

good with both is a feat very few restaurants in the city can boast of. And Zen 

? the Oriental eatery at The Park ? is definitely one of them. The restaurant 

digs deep into two very different cuisines from the far east ? Thai and Szechwan, 

offering authentic flavours from both.

Szechwan, explains chief chef Nut Kunlert , is one 

of the four provinces of China that has its own distinct culinary culture. ?The 

four provinces famous for their culinary heritage are Canton, Hunan, Shandong 

and Szechwan. At Zen, we specialise in Szechwan cuisine, which is the spiciest 

of the four. Peppercorn, a special variety of extra hot dried chilli, is used 

extensively and this makes it very spicy,? says Kunlert.

While both Thai and Szechwan can be clubbed under 

Oriental, the two cuisines differ more than they agree, says the chef. ?The primary 

focus and the methods of preparation vary widely in Chinese and Thai. While Thai 

cuisine is totally based on the use of fresh herbs, Chinese relies more on dry 

spices,? he adds. The two varieties differ in most other details of the cooking 

process, even in the way the vegetables and meats are cut. If in Chinese the vegetables 

are cut in small bite sizes, Thai food requires them to be slightly bigger. 

This explains why the two cuisines are dealt by two 

different units of the kitchen at Zen. ?Our kitchen has two separate sections 

for Chinese and Thai. Not only is the method of cooking different, the frequency 

at which the ingredients have to be sourced also differs in the two,? he adds. 

So, while Thai fresh herbs like lemon grass (one of the primary requisites in 

Thai food) kaffir lime leaf and Kalanga are imported from Bangkok once a week, 

the spices required for the Chinese section can be stored upto six months. 

A variety of sauces like oyster sauce, Hoisin sauce 

(Chinese barbecue sauce), sesame sauce and soya sauce and spices including peppercorn, 

cinnamon, star anise and five-spice powder are brought down from Hong Kong to 

be used in the Szechwan section. The Thai ingredients, sourced mostly from Bangkok, 

include fish sauce, coconut milk and various kinds of curry pastes, apart from 

the herbs. The seafood supplies for both cuisines come from Chennai, while the 

meats are all sourced locally.

The menu at Zen, in both sections, is reviewed every 

six months, with constant innovations to contemporarise it. The latest menu, which 

was introduced about a couple of weeks back, has been drawn up jointly by chef 

Kunlert and his father chef Pra Kob Samranreun from The Park Chennai. ?The new 

menu contains some age-old recipes that have been perfected and handed down over 

generations,? reveals Kunlert.

While every section ? from the starters and soups 

to the extensive main course ? bears ample signs of the father-son duo?s signature 

style, it?s the dessert section that?s truly unique. A variety of ice-cream flavours 

are whipped up in the kitchen, including ones like strawberry and black pepper 

ice cream, hot basil ice cream and coconut ice cream.

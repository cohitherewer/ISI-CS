The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 In love with rugby and rickshaws 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 SOME MERRY, SOME SCARY: Maori artistes perform their traditional song and dance. (PTI) 

 New Zealand se namaste, read the T-shirts of the 60 students from Tuakau College of New Zealand, on a four-day cultural visit to Calcutta.

 ?It?s great to be in this city, we are all so excited,? giggled Jaye Roimata, and the ring on her pierced tongue showed. And friend Kylie, standing by her side, nodded.

 The expression on the faces of the 30 parents and teachers, who were accompanying the students, was no different, as they watched the youngsters perform Maori songs and dances on the premises of the British deputy high commission on Wednesday. 

 ?Some of our songs are merry, some are sad? some can even be scary,? smiled another student, before joining the rest of her team.

 In the next three days, the students from the college south of Auckland will play exhibition rugby matches against teams comprising students of various city schools, stage a cultural programme and stop at as many places of interest as can be squeezed into their schedule.

 Visits to Jorasanko Thakurbari, an orphanage run by Missionaries of Charity and to the fruit market in Mechhua figure in their itinerary. And listening to Rabindrasangeet recitals and taking a ferry along the Hooghly are other must-dos.

 With Calcutta?s hand-pulled rickshaws nearing extinction, the visitors are all the more looking forward to a ride before breakfast on Thursday.

 Tuakau College, one of the leading colleges in New Zealand, is symbolic of the harmonious relationship that the Maoris, New Zealand?s indigenous people, and the Pakeha, the white settlers, in the country share.

 Swimming, rugby, athletics are just some of the sports that Tuakau students are crazy about. ?New Zealand is very passionate about rugby. So, the visiting students will take on teams of students from Calcutta schools in friendly matches,? said Willie Hetaraka, coach of the Indian rugby team and on the board of governors of Tuakau College.

 Zulfikar Hassan, joint commissioner, Armed Police, said that the young visitors will also take part in an interactive session on Thursday at Alipore Bodyguard Lines. The programme will be attended by street children who are part of the city police?s social welfare project.

 ?We hope on the 150th year celebrations of Calcutta Police next year, a team from New Zealand police can come down to play a few rugby matches with us,? joint commissioner Hassan signed off.

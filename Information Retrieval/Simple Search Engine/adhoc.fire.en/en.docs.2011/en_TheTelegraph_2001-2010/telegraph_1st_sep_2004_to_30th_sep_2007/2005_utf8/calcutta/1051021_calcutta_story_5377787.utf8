 Diwansons Jewellers is holding its seventh anniversary celebrations from October 19 to 23 at its Siddha Point outlet on Park Street.

 As part of the birthday bash, theres a discount on making charges. 

 Interesting games like Jewel Jigsaw and Bagatelle Box await those making purchases worth Rs 25,000 or more.

 The Arth collection includes intricate neckpieces and earrings in jadau combined with takkar work. Rajasthani and Gujarati motifs have been an inspiration, says director Bimal Diwan.

 Then there is the changeable jewellery line (starting at Rs 40,000) allowing a pendant to be incorporated into a ring or many other forms. 

 Some of the inclusions provide great gifting options, adds Diwan.

 The mens section includes elegant tie-pins, collar pins, flamboyant watches, buckles, pens and spectacle frames. The mens range starts from Rs 7,000.

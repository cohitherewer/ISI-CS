 It?s one small-screen comeback that?s got the big-screen biggies to back out in good time. It?s one fight for the eyeballs that?s had the drawing rooms drawing first blood against the Dolby theatres.

 The return of Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC) has put Bollywood on the backfoot with no film releasing this Friday, the launch day of the Amitabh Bachchan-hosted show. 

 Sources in Ram Gopal Varma?s Factory confirmed that the Varma-Anil Kapoor co-production My Wife?s Murder has been deferred to August 19 for KBC 2. The Akshay Kumar-Karisma Kapoor starrer Mere Jeevansaathi, which was slotted for August 5, has also been postponed indefinitely.

 No wonder, the city cineplexes are ready for the occupancy dip. Says Vikas Syal, general manager of INOX (Forum): ?If the content is not good, like this weekend, we are expecting a drop of 10 to 12 per cent in viewership.?

 Trade pundits are unanimous that staying away from the theatres this Friday was a good decision for the film producers. ?When the stakes are so high, no one would wish to run into a roadroller like KBC,? says trade analyst Komal Nahta. ?Also, with the show now coming on weekends, it?s sure to eat up the first three night shows of many new movies.?

 STAR TV, the host channel for the most-watched game show on Indian television, had declared the launch date much in advance. ?We were aware that KBC is a giant product and its return is going to be quite dramatic,? says Ajay Vidyasagar, senior vice-president, marketing and communications, STAR India. ?The last time KBC played on television, it did have a big impact on the box-office collections of films across the country.?

 This time, the buzz around KBC has been much bigger, with more than six crore calls coming in to book a berth in the hot seat. And with three Calcuttans making it to the Fastest-Finger-First round of the launch episode, the city is sure to give the movie screens a miss this weekend.

 However, Bachchan may have a serious contender in Aamir Khan, with Mangal Pandey: The Rising arriving next Friday.

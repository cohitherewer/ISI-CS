The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 ?I want to prove that I can act?

 MEGHNA NAIDU is back in another sleaze film but insists she has hidden talents to show, says Pratim D. Gupta

 Mumbai, post-floods, is still afraid of the R-word but Meghna Naidu is ready to Rain down on us. The Kaliyon ka chaman flower girl (a particular shot had her doing a Mena American Beauty Suvari, with more flora, of course) is back with another film whose posters scream out sleaze from every possible angle, or curve. But again she insists that the film isn?t really about The Body.

 ?It?s about a blind woman who writes poetry,? Meghna tries to explain in earnest. ?She has a rain phobia and the film traces what happens to her every time it rains outside. It?s a psychological thriller by Amol Shetge, the guy who made Gunaah (starring Dino Morea and Bipasha Basu).?

 Rain brings Meghna and Himanshu Malik together again. The two did another flesh-feast flick named Jackpot, whose promos have been flashing on the small screen since ages but the big-screen break hasn?t happened. ?I really don?t know why Jackpot has not released yet,? is the little Meghna can reveal, for once.

 But she is more than willing to talk about her garma-garam chemistry with Himanshu. ?We have always got along very well,? she says. ?But Rain being our second film together, we became very comfortable with each other and the movie became much easier to do. Being almost like buddies, we would rehearse together and have a very healthy relationship on the sets.?

 Are all these behind-the-camera healthy relationships (Meghna?s rapport with Hawas co-star Shahwar Ali is legendary) essential for on-screen sensuality? ?There is no deliberate attempt on my part to do these kind of films,? the lady protests. ?A film like Rain does have its share of glamour (read exposure) but the subject is such that it demands a lot of performance.?

 So, now she is Black?s Rani Mukherjee? ?It was really very difficult to play the character of the blind girl in the film,? Meghna tries again. ?My director Amol trained me for 20 days to get my body language and dialogue delivery right for the film. The role needed a lot of maturity on my part and I want to thank the producer and director for having faith in me as an actor. With this film, I want to make people believe that I can act.?

 That may not happen in the near future but it hasn?t stopped Meghna from signing another film. That too from the house of Karan Razdan who had shot her mostly bare-back in Hawas. ?It?s called Eight and is about shani ? what kind of an effect it has on us and how it affects all kinds of relationships.?

 But amidst all that flab, wasn?t she part of a Tollywood potboiler dancing around the trees with Mithunda (Chakraborty)? ?I loved doing Coolie,? Meghna says. ?Since then I have been getting so many Bengali film offers. But because of my hectic schedule (she jives to Kaliyon ka chaman in every second Mumbai concert in the same pink top!) I couldn?t do any of them. In fact, Mithunda himself called me up for two other Bengali films but I had to say no to him. Now that I am a bit free, I can take on something interesting.?

 Before all that, though, she has fallen victim to pluviophobia ? fear of rain. Come on, we all know what happens to Bollywood heroines when it rains. And with Meghna in the viewfinder, it?s not too hard to guess. Is it?

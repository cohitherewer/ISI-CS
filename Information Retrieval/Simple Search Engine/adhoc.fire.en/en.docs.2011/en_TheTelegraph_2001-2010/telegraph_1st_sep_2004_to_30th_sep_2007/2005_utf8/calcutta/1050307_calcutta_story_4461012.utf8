 Pak link slips past fake cash sleuths

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Though the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) claimed to have made a major breakthrough after arresting a former blood bank employee and seizing counterfeit currency worth Rs 22.5 lakh, a Pakistani national, who was supposed to receive the notes, managed to wriggle out.

 The Pakistani national, the link between ISI agents in Bangladesh and those operating in the city, gave CID officers the slip before police could cordon off his hideout in Howrah. 

 Rajeev Kumar, deputy inspector-general (operations), CID, said: ?We have identified the man, but his name cannot be disclosed for the sake of investigation. A hunt is on to track him down.?

 Shankar Acharya, 40, former blood bank employee, was arrested in his Lake View Road residence early on Saturday, a few hours after he had returned from Bangladesh. 

 Police seized the counterfeit notes, all in denominations of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000, stashed in a suitcase in Acharya?s apartment.

 Police found that all the security features of a genuine note were perfectly incorporated in the fakes. 

 ?And it was manufactured in a Karachi press. It is impossible for an ordinary counterfeiter to produce such notes,? said an officer, adding: ?This is the first time we have come across counterfeit notes bearing such a close resemblance to the real ones.? 

 According to the CID, Acharya was brought to book after two persons were arrested in Siliguri in January with counterfeit notes. 

 While investigating counterfeit currency notes entering the country through ISI channels, officials of the Subsidiary Intelligence Bureau (SIB), a Central intelligence agency, came to know that Acharya had crossed the Petrapole-Benapole border with the fake notes.

 Acharya was produced in Alipore court on Sunday and remanded in police custody till March 11.

 A CID officer said a team of CID officers went to Akhilbandhu Lane, in the Golabari police station area, around 2 am on Saturday. ?Tipped off by Acharya during preliminary interrogation, we surrounded the place where the Pakistani national had taken refuge. But he managed to escape a few minutes before we reached there,? said a CID official.

 The CID officials said the Pakistani national was supposed to receive the money from Acharya on Sunday morning. An officer claimed he first came to Dhaka from Karachi, and from there to Calcutta. ?We are now trying to find out the others in the fake currency racket,? said an official. The CID alerted city police after the arrest.

 You share your birthday with...

 Debasree Roy 

You are always brimming with new ideas, possibilities and dreams. You perform better in a team than on your own. You somehow find the time for every little thing. Your views are flexible and you adapt to situations easily. You are devoted to hard work and fair thinking. You are never scared or let down by criticism; you take it positively. ? Kusum Bhandari

 The government has decided to set up an agency, New Town Development Authority (NTDA), to implement development projects and look after civic amenities in New Town, Rajarhat, and its adjoining areas. 

 Officials said the agency will be responsible for maintenance of roads, lakes, parks, water-supply network, sewerage and solid waste management. It will also sanction building plans and redress disputes relating to land and buildings.

 Presently, a large chunk of the 3,050-hectare New Town is within Rajarhat-Gopalpur Municipality and the rest is under various panchayats in North and South 24-Parganas. Once the NTDA is formed, the entire township will come under its jurisdiction.

 The government has initiated proceedings to bring the adjoining areas of New Town under the Town and Country Planning Act, which will restrict land use and construction activities within a radius of 1.5 km around the township. A committee has been formed to frame a set of rules on land use in those areas.

 ?We are developing the areas. We need an agency to look after the infrastructure that we are setting up there,? said housing minister and Hidco chairman Goutam Deb, explaining the rationale behind forming the NTDA.

 ?The NTDA will keep track of the residents? needs and provide them with basic civic amenities. Hidco, the implementing agency of the township, will function as the parent organisation. We will soon introduce a Bill in the Assembly to set up the NTDA,? the minister added.

 Members of the agency will be nominated and will comprise representatives of Hidco and the departments of public health engineering, irrigation and housing. City planners and architects, too, will be included.

 Now, the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) is the sole development agency functioning in and around the city. 

 It was set up in 1970 for executing various development projects and its jurisdiction extends across the Calcutta Metropolitan Area, which includes the city and parts of Howrah, Hooghly, Nadia and North and South 24-Parganas.

 The first development authority of the city had been the Calcutta Improvement Trust (CIT), set up by the British in 1911. After the CMDA was set up, the CIT was merged with it.

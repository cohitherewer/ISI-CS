 Two musicians from Calcutta will make India?s debut at the International Festival of University Music (FIMU) at Belfort, France, later this month. The platform ? shared by 2,300 musicians in 109 groups from 40 countries, performing 250 free concerts on 14 stages over three days ? will feature a Classical music presentation by Partho Sarathy on sarod and Apurba Mukherjee on tabla.

 ?This is the first time India will feature in FIMU alongside other new countries like Bahrain, China, Ecuador and Tchad,? said the festival authorities. Organised in a 17th century building at the old city centre of Belfort, the festival will be held between May 14 and 16 and is to include all kinds of musical forms and formats.

 Partho Sarathy, who is already a well-known name in the world of music, having performed at venues like the Royal Albert Hall in London and the UNESCO Hall in Paris, is currently in London on a performance tour. Apurba, who conducts regular workshops in cities like Toulouse and Lyon and has also performed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston, and the Palace of Fine Arts, San Francisco, will leave for France on Tuesday.

 ?One of my students in France gave our CD to the FIMU authorities,? said Apurba. ?They liked our work and invited us to perform last December.? Apart from the one-hour shows on all three days of the festival, the duo will give a live interview on the French radio channel France Bleu, and is slated to perform at seven or eight other places in France afterwards.

 The musicians have not decided which piece they will present for an expected audience of around 60,000, from all over the world. ?It will be pure Indian classical music ? no fusion of any sort,? stressed Apurba. ?Which raga Partho will play will depend on the time we are asked to perform. As of now, we are slated to perform at 9 pm. So we would go for some mellow night ragas.?

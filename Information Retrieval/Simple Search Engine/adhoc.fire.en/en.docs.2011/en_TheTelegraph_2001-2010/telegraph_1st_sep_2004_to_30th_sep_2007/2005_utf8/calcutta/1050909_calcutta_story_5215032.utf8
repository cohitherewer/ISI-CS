 Queries for schools finalised

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The 12-member committee set up by the state government finalised on Thursday the questionnaire that the private English-medium schools will have to fill up and submit. 

 The body was formed in July to look into complaints by guardians and teachers that many of the schools were providing sub-standard education against exorbitant fees and to frame guidelines to regulate the functioning of the schools.

 The questionnaire will be sent to the 375-odd schools across the state from next week, said Ardhendu Sekhar Biswas, commissioner of school education and chairman of the panel.

 The questions, he said, were based on every aspect of the administrative and academic functioning of the educational institutions. 

 The total assets of the school, the number of buildings it has, its bank details, fee structure, teachers? pay-scale, condition of its laboratories and library, and the extra-curricular activities conducted by it are some of the heads under which information has been sought.

 The panel, which started functioning from August 10, held its third meeting on Thursday. ?We have reached the most vital part of our exercise ? collecting information from the schools. The schools will be given a fixed time to answer the queries and send their opinions to the committee,? commissioner Biswas said.

 The questionnaire will be distributed among all ICSE and CBSE schools in the state. Suggestions have been invited from individuals, parents of students and teachers as well.

 Apart from collecting the data, the government had also asked the committee to suggest the maximum fees that can be charged from students of each class of the schools.

 Teachers and guardians, however, have expressed doubts whether the government will be able to take stern action if any school is found at fault after the completion of this exercise.

 The question cropped up after the government showed its reluctance to take a hard line on this issue after the second meeting of the panel.

 ?We can withdraw the no-objection certificates (NOC) of the schools even under the present system. But such a measure will jeopardise the career of the students,? commissioner Biswas reasoned.

 Under the existing system, private English-medium schools affiliated to boards other than the state-controlled West Bengal Board of Secondary Education are required to obtain an NOC before seeking affiliation to the Delhi-based boards.

 Former footballers from Calcutta will travel to tsunami-affected parts of the country, from Nagapattinam to Car Nicobar, on twin missions: to help revive the game and heal the wounds of many a youngster.

 It?s part of a project undertaken by the All India Football Federation (AIFF), the parent body of the game in the country. The plan entails identifying and relaying of football fields and readying the academies and the infrastructure for supporting the game.

 ?Several footballers from the past, including Prasun Mukherjee and Brahmanand, will visit the affected areas. The killer waves have left an indelible scar on the lives of countless people, especially children. Handing them jerseys and spending time with them can make a world of difference,? said Subrata Dutta, secretary of the Indian Football Association (IFA). 

 Plans to revive the game in Car Nicobar includes: 

 Building an all-facility football academy where 

tsunami survivors, especially the children, can practise the game to overcome 

the trauma 

 Setting up the infrastructure required for 

youth development; schoolboys with a talent for the game will be selected to take 

part in the Subroto Cup tournament

 The school in Car Nicobar and adjacent football 

fields, destroyed by the earthquake and the tsunami, will be re-laid; more grounds 

will be identified to promote the game. 

 Seized of the fact that the waves had robbed thousands of their livelihood, the AIFF is also focussing on a series of youth development programmes in places outside the Andaman Islands, such as Pondicherry.

 The eastern coast, which bore the brunt of the devouring waves on December 26, has long been nurturing football talents, many of whom have become national stars. 

 To ensure that the coastline does not lose its significance in the history of the game, the AIFF will locate one football field in every affected area and develop it. 

 This apart, the IFA on its own has decided to invite footballers from the Andamans to take part in an annual spot-the-talent contest in Calcutta, to be known as football bazaar. 

 ?From April 8 to 13, we will organise the event, where footballers from across the country will get an opportunity to display their talents,? said secretary Dutta.

 The other plans of the AIFF and the IFA include: 

 Distribution of footballs and jerseys to the 

children from all tsunami-hit areas

 Rebuilding grounds, rehabilitating players

 Identification of affected individuals and 

helping them to get government funds for rehabilitation.

 Besides, football matches featuring the national teams of Asia versus a selected Asia XI will be held in every tsunami-affected country to raise funds for the survivors.

 During a recent visit to my cousin?s in Kankurgachhi, I noticed that the glass 

door of the ATM of SBI?s Bagmari branch located in the area, doesn?t close automatically. 

I was told that the locking system of the door was out of order for many days. 

Usually, the customer is required to insert the card in the slot provided outside 

the ATM door. Only then does the door get unlocked and the customer is allowed 

inside the ATM. In this particular case, the door remained unlocked at all times. 

I request the bank authorities to repair the locking system to provide better 

security to its ATM users.

 The grace period of BSNL?s prepaid connection (Excel) was first reduced from 

60 to 30 days. It was then brought down to 15 days. Now it has been slashed to 

seven days. Perhaps, BSNL is taking its subscribers for granted. The longer grace 

period was one of the reasons for customers to stick to BSNL despite poor service. 

If BSNL acts pricey, it would soon start losing subscribers to its rivals.

 Autorickshaw drivers are charging fares as high as Rs 8 instead of the stipulated 

Rs 5.50 from Kankurgachhi to Ganesh Talkies. Students and office-goers are forced 

to put up with this unfair practice.

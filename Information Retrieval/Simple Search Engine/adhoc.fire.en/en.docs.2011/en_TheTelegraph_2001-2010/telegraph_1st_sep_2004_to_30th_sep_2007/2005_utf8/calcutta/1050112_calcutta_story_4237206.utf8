 The waterbody next to the main gate of Science City is not properly maintained. 

Plastic packets and other garbage, dumped by visitors, float in the pond. The 

ugly sight puts off visitors. Hundreds of schoolchildren visit Science City frequently. 

What kind of impression would the dirty surroundings leave on them? The Science 

City management should either take up the responsibility of the pond?s upkeep 

or urge the civic body to clean it.

 The fish market in the vicinity of the Howrah railway station on Mukhram Kanoria 

Road is a threat to the environment. The fish mongers dispose of rotten fish, 

unused baskets and other waste on the roads adjacent to the market. For quite 

a few years, local clubs and small NGOs have been urging the Howrah Municipal 

Corporation (HMC) and the Howrah Improvement Trust to shift the market elsewhere 

or at least make provisions for a proper waste disposal system. Local residents 

and even those who have put up at the small hotels in the area are unable to withstand 

the stench emitted by the garbage. HMC should also demolish the vacant shanties 

on the market premises which have turned into a den of drug smugglers, addicts 

and goons.

 The airport authorities must put up display boards to inform those in the visitors? 

gallery of the exact time of arrival and departure of flights. Often, when one 

goes to the airport to see off a relative or friend, there is no way to ascertain 

when exactly the plane has taken off. Sometimes, the flight is cancelled after 

the scheduled departure time. Only when the flight has taken off can the visitor 

leave with peace of mind.

 Nowadays, it is invariably found that postcards and inland letters do not have 

stamps of proper denomination printed on them. Hence, buyers are required to affix 

extra stamps on them. Can?t the postal authorities supply postcards and inland 

letters with the correct denomination of pre-printed stamps on them?

 Govinda Bakshi, Budge Budge. 

 Milk supplied by the state government costs Rs 14.60 per litre. As 10 and 20 

paise coins are not easily available, customers are forced to deposit a higher 

amount while renewing their monthly cards. I appeal to the authorities concerned 

to suitably modify the price so as to safeguard the interest of the customers. 

 Piyal Mukherjee, Lake Town.

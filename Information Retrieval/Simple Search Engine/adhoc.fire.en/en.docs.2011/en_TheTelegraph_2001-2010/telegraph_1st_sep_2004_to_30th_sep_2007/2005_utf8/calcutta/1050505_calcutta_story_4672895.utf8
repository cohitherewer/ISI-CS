The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

In quandary over e-waste

DEEPANKAR GANGULY

With electronic waste turning into a serious threat 

to the city?s solid-waste management, mayor Subrata Mukherjee and municipal commissioner 

Debashis Som, who is an IIT engineer, held a meeting last week to find ways and 

means of tackling the problem. 

They felt that unless a proper electronic waste management 

policy was framed soon, the situation would spin out of control by the next decade.

According to a preliminary estimate of the Centre 

for Quality Management, Jadavpur University, about 400,000 mobile phones are being 

discarded in Calcutta each year, generating over 60 tonnes of electronic waste. 

If discarded electronic toys, TV sets, CD players 

and personal computers are taken into account, the annual generation of electronic 

waste in Calcutta will be over 5,000 tonnes, pointed out mayor Mukherjee.

The Calcutta Metropolitan Planning Committee (CMPC), 

too, in its five-year development plan for environment in the Calcutta Metropolitan 

Area (CMA), has asked the civic authorities to undertake an immediate action programme, 

in consultation with universities and research institutes, for the management 

of electronic waste.

The CMPC status report reveals that over 1,200 computers 

are discarded every day in the country, and the total annual generation of electronic 

waste from discarded computers alone in six megacities, including Calcutta, is 

more than 10,800 tonnes. 

If no immediate action is planned, the situation will 

go out of hand, since the present growth rate of computer use is 600 per cent 

per annum.

According to the Centre for Quality Management, Jadavpur 

University, one TV or computer monitor contains up to three kg of lead. It also 

contains mercury. The circuitboards of a discarded electronic item contains materials 

like chromium, lead, mercury, nickel and arsenic.

The most alarming part of the problem is that like 

plastic and polyethylene, these electronic waste, too, are not bio-degradable. 

The traditional waste management practice of burying 

discarded electronic stuff is not possible, explained civic chief engineer (conservancy) 

Arun Sarkar.

He cited two reasons? first, it will crowd out bio-degradable 

garbage. Second, it may cause chemical contamination of sub-soil water. 

Sarkar said polybags have already become a headache 

for the civic conservancy and drainage and sewerage departments. Several tonnes 

of polybags enter the city?s drainage and sewerage network daily.

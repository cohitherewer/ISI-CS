The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 A few days ago, while walking down Strand Road, I noticed a gathering at an illicit liquor shop near the Eden Gardens railway station. I had to catch the evening?s Habra local train and was standing on the platform when a drunk entered the station premises. He made obscene gestures and used foul language at passers-by and bystanders. In order to avoid a confrontation, most people stayed out of his way. There were no policemen in sight to tackle the situation. I request the railway authorities to pull down the liquor shop at the earliest for the safety of the passengers.

 The customer care helpline (123) of BSNL?s CellOne mobile service is often inaccessible. When the service is needed the most, all the lines are busy. The company should maintain a system wherein all its cell phone users have prompt access to its customer care personnel 24 hours a day.

 The crossing under the flyover near Haldiram?s, on VIP Road, has become a death trap. Most residents of the neighbouring areas use the spot to cross the road. The transport authorities are requested to make a zebra crossing at the junction and instal traffic lights or deploy a traffic policeman to control traffic at the location.

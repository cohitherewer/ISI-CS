 The detectives of this crime-fighting team are back in the sixth season of Law and Order: Special Victims Unit on Wednesday, on STAR World. 

 The hard-hitting and emotional series chronicles the life and work of the New York Police Department unit that deals with the more sensitive crimes like rape and child kidnappings.

 The drama follows detective Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni), a veteran of the unit, and his partner, detective Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay), whose difficult past is the reason she joined the unit.

 In the first episode, Patty Branson, 6, is nearly abducted from Central Park. 

 Catch it at 10 pm.

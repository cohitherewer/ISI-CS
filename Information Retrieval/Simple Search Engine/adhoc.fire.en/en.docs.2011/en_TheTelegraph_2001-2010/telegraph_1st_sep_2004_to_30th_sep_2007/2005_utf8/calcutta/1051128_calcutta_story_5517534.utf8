The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Placements pour on Joka

 BISWARUP GOOPTU

 The city?s premier management campus, in Joka, has recorded it?s ?best ever? summer placements, with 172 students being placed in slot zero and 83 in slot one, respectively. A slot three was scheduled, but was not required.

 With 110 firms, up from 85 last year, participating in the placement initiative, the entire batch of 255 students of Indian Institute of Management Calcutta was placed in just three days. The monthly stipends on offer were as high as $7,000 and Rs 1,00,000. 

 Slot zero is the eve of placement programme, when the cream of the corporate world visits the campus to offer placements. Slot one is the first day of the programme. Slot zero saw participation of 20 firms and placement of 62 students (against 29 last year).

 An interesting trend of this year?s exercise, point out campus sources, was that a number of students rejected offers to work abroad and opted for domestic jobs. Placement representative Anupam Agarwal said: ?Our students went with their preference. For example, some of them felt consulting was a better option than investment banking, although the investment banks were offering placements abroad. A foreign placement was not the criterion, the role offered by the company and the scope for growth were.?

 The financial services sector was the major recruiter, picking up a whopping 97 candidates. FMCGs were not far behind. Lehman Brothers, JP Morgan, HSBC and Temasek Holdings were some of the big names. The firms that swooped on the campus were from biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and health services, media and entertainment, real estate development and finance and venture capital.

 A major feather in the cap for the B-school was the first-time participation of management and strategy consulting firm Boston Consulting Group (BCG), along with Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB) and Bloomberg (New York). The last two choose Joka as their preferred recruiting hubs.

 ?IIM Calcutta has an extremely good reputation among consultant firms and investment banks. Hence, the presence of the financial services sector on our campus was not really a surprise,? said placement representative Agarwal. 

 ?As regards the large number of offers made by them, one has to take into account the fact that any organisation would like to have a look at the prospective candidate for two months while he or she is working with them, as opposed to just an hour-long interview, in order to make a pre-placement offer,? he added. 

 In terms of functional areas on offer, there was a greater diversity on campus this year. Candidates were made overseas offers in all the slots, as opposed to only slot zero in the previous years.

 The Calcutta party people were treated to some unusual sounds on Saturday night. DJ Paco De La Cruz played some Brazil-electro and Latin-electro music at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC) Bacardi Blast. The DJ from Morocco is famous for the innovative sounds he creates by mixing music from different cultures.

 But Calcuttans, used to hardcore Bollywood beats on weekends, did not seem to take to the strange notes too well. So much so that the dance floor wore a deserted look most of the time.

 When I am coming out to party on a Saturday night, pure entertainment is the only thing on my mind. We are not out to prove that Calcuttans can shake to all beats. If Bollywood is what keeps me going, so be it, said party hopper Kunal Sen.

 Gauging this popular mood, the DJ soon switched to disco and funk.

 These genres of music are universal favourites, said the 35-year-old DJ as the night wore on.

 Stitch stop

 Hakoba, a national chain specialising in embroidered fabrics, launched its second outlet in the city at The Gariahaat Mall on Sunday. Inaugurated by Tollywood actress Rituparna Sengupta, the store marks the 33rd outlet of Hakoba in the country. 

 Hakoba specialises in embroidered saris, salwar suits and running fabrics. And with a design set-up that employs more than 40,000 people nationally, the label is now ready to venture into readymade garments, too. We will soon begin a range of mens shirts and ladies garments, says Raj Kumar Sekhani, chairman, Hakoba.

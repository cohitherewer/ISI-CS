 ?Kidnap? driver in a bind

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The story behind the disappearance of Rajiv Bhattacharya, London-based IBM global manager, may be a closed chapter. He is home, safe and sound, and police have washed their hands of the case.

 But Gajendra Roy, driver of the Bhattacharyas and the only person arrested in connection with Rajiv?s ?abduction?, is still behind the bars. 

 He has been in the Maniktala police station lock-up since June 1, despite chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s statement that Rajiv?s disappearance was not a case of abduction.

 Asked why the driver was still in custody, police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee said: ?We are yet to close the case. Roy will be released as soon as the investigation is completed. Officers are now verifying some minor facts and the process will take a few more days.?

 The Bhattacharyas, too, believe that the driver, appointed six months ago, had no hand in Rajiv?s disappearance. 

 ?We think he was no way involved with the incident. After his release, we will appoint him again,? said Rajiv?s cousin Partha Chakraborty.

 Elaborating on what led to the arrest of Roy, police commissioner Mukherjee said: ?We initially treated the case as one of abduction and, accordingly, Roy was thoroughly examined. He was arrested after officers found a number of inconsistencies in his statement.?

 According to deputy commissioner (eastern suburban division) Jawed Shamim, Roy will be released in a day or two. ?Officers are now trying to gather some more evidence to convince the court that it was not a case of abduction.?

 Sources said Roy could only be released after police formally closed the case and informed the court about it. 

 Officers at Maniktala police station said Roy was not being treated like the others in the lock-up. 

 ?We don?t keep him confined during the day. He moves around freely and chats with us. His friends are also allowed to meet him at the police station. It?s only at night that we bring him back to the lock-up,? said an officer.

 Roy?s family, however, is yet to reach the city from Bihar. ?None of his relatives has come calling so far, though his friends from Taltala, where he lives, drop by regularly,? said the officer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 At zero degrees C, it?s real cool

 - Nightclub promises chill-out zone to sip a few in early 2006

 BABY, IT?S COLD INSIDE: What the interiors of the night club will look like

 Chilling out will never be the same again ? at least for those stepping into a 350-sq-ft space on Camac Street, post-January. For, they will be entering ?the country?s first ice bar?, where the temperature will be 0? Celsius.

 Venom is the nightclub ? opening at Fort Knox, 6, Camac Street, post-Puja ? where a cool corner will be carved out for the party people. To stop them from freezing over, woollens are to be picked up and then returned at the door.

 ?Ice bars are a craze abroad. I got the inspiration from a bar called Ski I visited in Singapore,? says Bunty Sethi, the man behind Venom, after Anti-Clock (later Winning Streak) in HHI, and now Starstruck Retro Lounge in Forum.

 ?The ice bar could be the starting point of your night out,? suggests Sethi. ?Drop in for a couple of drinks in cold comfort, grab a bite at the restaurant and then hit the dance floor. Then, maybe, come back to the ice bar to cool off...?

 Of the 11,000 sq ft Fort Knox night haunt, the disc will be spread over 4,500 sq ft, the ice bar 350 sq ft and the rest will be the restaurant dishing out tandoori and more.

 And the city party hopper can?t wait to get into zone zero. 

 ?I went to an ice bar abroad around six years ago and the experience was really cool. If this happens in Calcutta, it will take the city right up the party-pick list,? says entrepreneur Navin Pai.

 Scripting new rules of revelry is a must amidst this nightlife boom in town, says Sethi. So, it?s time to just chill chill, just chill?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Patients languish in strike rites 

 Ring of relief

 OUR BUREAU

 Dhaneswar Nath, 47, was on the Guwahati-Thiruvananthapuram Express with an oxygen pipe fitted to his nose. His condition worsened after supporters of the Citu strike stopped the train for several hours at Contai Road, in West Midnapore, on Thursday morning.

 The train was allowed to leave at 1.30 pm, but Nath?s condition could have turned fatal had not a railway medical team rushed to his rescue before that. ?Doctors treated him on the train and the oxygen cylinder was replaced,? said a South Eastern Railway official.

 A similar fate threatened nearly 40 patients, returning from Vellore on the Yaswantpur Express. The train was stopped at Balichak station, around 100 km from Calcutta, at 7.40 am. 

 The patients and the other passengers, left with no food or drinking water, were stranded till 1.40 pm, when Left Front chairman Biman Bose asked his cadre to let the train roll on.

 It was stopped again, at Mecheda, at 2.30 pm. This time, fortunately, the blockade was brief ? lifted after 45 minutes following persuasion by railway officials. The train finally reached Howrah at 8 pm.

 ?It was with great difficulty that we cleared the tracks for the two trains,? said Shakeel Ahmed, divisional railway manager, Kharagpur. 

 According to CPM sources, Bose acted immediately after getting news of the stranded patients. ?He got in touch with Left Front leaders in West Midnapore and asked them to ensure that the patients did not face any inconvenience,? a leader said.

 Passengers on some other trains, however, were not as lucky. Reports of disruptions poured in from across the state. Several trains, local and long-distance, were delayed, rescheduled or cancelled. 

 Among the trains cancelled were the Sealdah-New Delhi Rajdhani Express, Shalimar-Digha-Santragachhi Express, Ispat Express and the Aranyak Express. The tracks were blocked at 23 stations in the Sealdah division and 29 stations in the Howrah division. 

 City-bound trains such as the Rajdhani Express (Sealdah), Kalka Mail, Amritsar Mail, Doon Express and the Shipra Express were detained along the route.

 Fusion, the bar, lounge, restaurant and hookah hangout at The Golden Park has added another item to its array ? an Indian selection on the menu.

 ?We were serving Chinese, Mongolian and Continental dishes earlier. But there was a huge demand for Indian food. During the winter season, people prefer kebabs and tikkas in the evening,? explained B.S. Gujral, managing director, The Golden Park.

 The desi offering was unveiled on the last day of last year and comes with a separate 50-seater area in the sprawling lounge. The treats are being tossed up in a live kitchen.

 ?Patrons also have the option of walking into the kitchen and choosing exactly what they want to eat,? added Gujral. 

 The vegetarian starter selection includes Makai Seekh Kebab and Tandoori Seekh Kebab, which cost Rs 110. For non-vegetarians, Fish Chandi Kebab, Murgh Pahari Kebab and Gosht Reshmi Boti are hearty options, at Rs 145 each. The main course takes in Pindi Chana, Sham Savera Kofta and Paneer Kurchan for veggies and Fish Dahiwala, Murg Dhania and Mutton Roganjosh for the non-vegetarians. The prices range between Rs 150 and Rs 185 per dish.

 Dessert, in the form of Tutti Fruity, Caramel Custard or Firni, costs between Rs 75 and Rs 85.

 Kebab craze

 Multi-cuisine restaurant Pakwan at 70B Purna Das Road has kicked off a kebab festival, called Kool Kebabs. There is a mind-boggling 99 varieties of kebabs to chose from.

 Under the able direction of chef Muhammad Shammi, the selection includes a well-researched mixture of north Indian, Punjabi, Hyderabadi and Chettinad Awadhi (cooked on the tawa) styles.

 ?Having a festival with the same usual kebabs makes no sense. I wanted to come up with a range to stir the diner?s curiosity,? explained restaurateur Soma Sharma.

 In the vegetarian basket, the Zafrani Malai Paneer Kebab, the Stuffed Capsicum Kebab and the Sultana Kebab promise to be real treats and are priced at Rs 60.

 For the fishy folk, the Machhi Khatti Meethi Kebab is the chef?s recommendation, while the mutton-munchers can dig into the Samarkand Boti Kebab (with a mixture of almond, pistachio and cashew) and the Lucknowi Galouti Kebab. 

 Chicken lovers are advised to try the spicy Stuffed Chicken Kebab and the creamy Chicken Chandi Tangri Kebab. The non-vegetarian items are priced between Rs 75 and Rs 85.

 The festival will be on till January 9, so go ahead and dig into the juicy morsels or have them delivered at your doorstep (24653476).

 Prime target tram tracks in project road repair

 - Rs 70-crore restoration scheme covering 14 arterial stretches set to roll in election countdown

 SIMI KAMBOJ

 With Assembly elections knocking on the door, Writers? Buildings is all ready to repair roads in north and central Calcutta. And it?s target tram tracks.

 Buoyed by the tram-track repairs, with Japanese funds, along Rashbehari Avenue and at the Park Circus and Maniktala intersections, the transport department is keen to ensure the participation of the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC) in the restoration of 14 arterial roads. All of them have tram tracks and are paved by potholes.

 ?We will join hands with Calcutta Municipal Corporation to carry out de-reservation of tram tracks over the next three months. Once the track beds are made concrete, the civic body will conduct mastic repairs and do at-grade improvement. The focus roads include two important north-south corridors ? APC Road and Bidhan Sarani,? said transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury.

 Rabindra Sarani, Lenin Sarani, College Street, MG Road, Government Place (East) and the Bowbazar, Rajabazar and Maniktala areas are also likely to benefit from the Rs 70-crore project, to be implemented in two phases, divided into four packages, and covering 21 km.

 Nine companies have shown interest in the project. Their tenders will be opened and the contractors finalised on Friday. The deadline is March 31 next year, but it is likely to be pushed back, said officials.

 ?We?ll have to work out the traffic diversions and roadblocks to be imposed while the work is on. This sort of work on the congested roads of north and central Calcutta can lead to massive traffic snarls. Thoroughfares like Rabindra Sarani might have to be completely blocked,? said a senior traffic police officer. 

 The first package of phase I will see concretisation and levelling of tram tracks along Bidhan Sarani, Lenin Sarani, College Street and Nirmal Chandra Street. The second package will cover BB Ganguly Street and MG Road, from Sealdah flyover to Strand Road. The second phase would involve the repair and concretisation of six major roads, including APC Road, CIT Road and Rabindra Sarani.

 Books took a back seat as fun with funda ruled the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta (IIMC) campus between January 7 and 9. 

 With Intaglio 2005 ? the annual B-school meet ? drawing the best of B-brains, the Joka campus became the venue for free-wheeling sessions on the theme of the meet, Excelling at Managing Change. 

 ?Over 200 participants took part in the events. The success of all the new events introduced this year was evident from the applause received from the participants,? said a spokesperson for the external relations cell of the premier B-school. Around 120 participants came down from other campuses, which included overseas teams from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Asian Institute of Technology. 

 From management games ? Finesse (for finance enthusiasts), Selling Point (for pitching professionals), Bulls and Bears (for those keeping track of the bourses) and Stratgem (for strategic thinkers) ? to lecture sessions, the meet had the proper mix-n-match for the budding managers. 

 While the hosts managed to hold back ?Swiss Knife?, the prestigious award given to the overall best performing team, JBIMS from Mumbai walked away with the title of ?Quizzical?, the challenging quiz event conducted by Siddharth Basu. 

 The highlight of the closing day was the lecture delivered by Ajit Balakrishnan ? founder of Rediff and also the institute?s alumnus ? around the festival theme. He stressed the need for the organisations to constantly innovate and upgrade themselves to keep pace with ever-changing technologies and the dynamic business environment. 

 Not just business leaders, academicians, too, shared their thoughts with the students. Lecture sessions by Omkar Goswami, former chief economist of the Confederation of Indian Industry, and Prof Mohanbir Sawhney, of the Kellogg School of Management were the big draws. 

 On Day Two, the grooming session by Raymond students on how to dress was attended by a packed auditorium. Curtains came down on Intaglio 2005 with Parikrama rocking the students on Sunday night.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Buses want tax cut

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Lobbies representing the owners of 16,000 private buses and 2,800 minibuses that ply in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area on Wednesday threatened to launch an ?aggressive? campaign to press for withdrawal of various taxes and cess to keep the fare structure intact, in the wake of the petrol and diesel price hike.

 ?If they (the government) do not meet our demand, we may have to resort to drastic measures in the next 48 hours,? warned Sadhan Das, general secretary of the joint council of bus syndicate, hinting at a possible strike.

 As soon as transport minister Subhas Chakraborty referred to a rise in bus and minibus fares after the Centre announced the fuel price hike, various bus owners? associations started pressuring the state to withdraw the taxes and cess so that fares remained unchanged.

 ?The prices of diesel were increased two times in the recent past. It has been difficult for owners to keep the services going, as with every rise in oil prices, other expenditure also increases. The police, too, have pushed up various fines. Increasing fares alone will never solve the problem. On the contrary, commuters will come under unnecessary pressure,? pointed out Das.

 He stressed that the government should withdraw the existing taxes and cess to solve the problem. 

 ?We will launch an aggressive campaign if the government does not take a decision on this within the next 48 hours,? he threatened. 

 Swarnakamal Saha, president of Bengal Bus Syndicate, echoed what Das had said and added that nearly half of the profit a bus owner registers is swallowed up by the prices of oil and employees? commissions.

 ?There is no alternative to waiving taxes,? agreed Saha. 

 Abasesh Das, general secretary, Minibus Operators? Association, supported the view.

 Many Left parties have launched campaigns against the fuel price hike.

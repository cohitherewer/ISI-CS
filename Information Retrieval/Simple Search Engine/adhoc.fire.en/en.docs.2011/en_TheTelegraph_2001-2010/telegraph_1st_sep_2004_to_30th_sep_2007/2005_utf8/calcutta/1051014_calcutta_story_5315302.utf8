The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Spice quest and space research

 - BENGALIS ?DELIGHTFUL?

 SEBANTI SARKAR

 ?Too much history is written by historians for historians; I think it?s time that changed,? says John Keay, in town to launch his latest book, The Spice Route.

 Though history was his subject in Oxford, Keay prefers to be described as a history-writer. ?History should be like poetry. Instead of addressing a select academic circle, it should be written in a way everyone enjoys, authoritative yet attractive. History should be as fluid and readable as literature. That was how it started, anyway, with Gibbon and Carlyle?,? Keay points out.

 ?Sure, there are publisher?s deadlines, but one must devote as much time and effort to crafting the book as one devotes to research. And from a country which has produced such wonderful writers in English, like Vikram Seth, and has so much history to document, this should be easy,? says the Scotsman.

 Keay (pronounced ?K?) celebrated his 64th birthday on a lecture tour through 14 cities of India, the country which has been the subject of most of his 20 acclaimed books.

 His relationship with India goes back to 1966 ,when he was ?trout-fishing in Kashmir?. Later, as a reporter with The Economist of London, he even covered the general elections. In 1972, Keay married Julia (also a writer) in Kulu. Though settled in Scotland, the family?s Indian links have continued to grow stronger. Nell, one of their four children, works for Indian plays and theatre.

 So how does Keay find India today? ?There has been a gap of 40 years since I first came. India has changed, and so has the world.? Calcutta is ?unrecognisable? with its flyovers, new buildings, the Metro, he feels. But not all the change has been for the good. ?People are more materialistic?, and this, unfortunately, is true also of Calcutta, a city he ?loved primarily for the people?.

 ?Bengalis I have found are the most delightful company. They have this ability to laugh at themselves. And where else would you find metaphysics being discussed on a crowded bus?? smiles Keay.

 Keay?s own speech at the British Council on October 1 was sprinkled with witticisms that had the gathering of scholars and professors in splits. Globalisation, according to Keay, began with the spice trade, involving Europeans, Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Persians, Arabs, Gujaratis, Tamils, Sri Lankans, Malays, Indonesians and Chinese.

 Equating the quest to understand spice with the world?s ongoing space research, Keay illustrated, through slides and textual references, what an amazing and far-reaching impact the series of quests had.

 The book, a first on the subject, also shows how ironically the value of spices fell, as the spice routes became clearer and tea, cotton, silk and chocolates became the new must-haves of Europe.

 That the book will not meet with passivity was clear by the question-answer session following the lecture. Spice, after all, is an essential and integral part of India.

 And Keay?s own writing plans, ?after a book on China?, will gravitate to ?more books on Indian subjects?.

 ANUMITA GHOSH

 Decor destination 

 Your home d?cor ? be it furnishing, flooring or knick knacks ? speaks volumes about your personal style and aesthetics. And its often quite difficult to hunt out designs that mirror your tastes and preferences. 

 Lifestyle Furnishing, a one-stop home linen store on Lord Sinha Road, could be a good destination for some pretty, practical and pocket-friendly stuff.

 We want to make shopping easier for our customers, who will find everything from furnishing, bed and bath linen to floor materials and carpets under one roof, explains a spokesperson for the store. 

 Cover up

 The extensive range of upholstery materials comes in chenille, cottons, jacquard, khadi silk, polyester, satin, suede leather-finish and other imported fabrics. These are usually in florals, checks, stripes and solids. Prices range between Rs 69 and Rs 595 per metre.

 The assortment of cushion covers in vibrant hues can lend a lot of colour to your living room. Team these with bright curtains and window decorations. 

 Curtain call

 Curtains in polysilk, cotton, polyester, net, velour and fur come in a multitude of colours and patterns. Add a dash of elegance to these with tassels and fringes that give your ordinary window treatment a fancy finish. 

 Do away with old-fashioned hooks and go for the swanky tie-back holders in crystals, wood or metal. Also on offer is an array of attractive shower curtains. 

 The racks housing the upholstery and the curtains present a riot of colours with traditional browns, maroons, blues, greens, black, white and beige as well as more trendy oranges, lemon, saffron and lilac. 

 Bed beauties

 The range of bed linen and accessories comprises pillows and pillow covers, duvet and duvet covers, bolsters and bolster covers. 

 This section features solids and prints from reputed and imported brands, as well as ethnic Rajasthani and Gujarati mirror-work and aari-work. Also available is a variety of quilts, special throws for air-conditioned rooms and dohars. 

 Floor fashion

 To complement the home linen and upholstery, theres a wide variety of wall-to-wall carpets ? acrylic, cut pile, loop pile, woven, non-woven and synthetic. 

 Apart from these, there are rugs in various shapes and sizes, embellished with floral and geometric designs. 

 There are other flooring options displayed to give a home-like feel. You can choose from the classic wooden, the astro-turf and the PVC, which also offers wooden, Italian marble or granite looks.

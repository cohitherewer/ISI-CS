The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Shield or sieve, ask sceptic greens

 - Lack of initiative to counter realty boom in the wetlands

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The government has finally come up with an ordinance to safeguard the fragile East Calcutta wetlands, but the green lobby is not quite convinced yet.

 Announcing the East Calcutta Wetlands (Conservation amp; Management) Ordinance, 2005, on Thursday, environment minister Manab Mukherjee had stressed the need for a ?legal framework? to conserve the ecosystem on the Ramsar list of wetlands (see map).

 On Friday, a 20-member team visited the site for a proposed Nature and Wetland Interpretation Centre near Bantala. The centre, on 30 acres, would ?increase awareness about the wetlands?.

 Though the government is talking tough ? violation of the ordinance would be deemed non-bailable ? its plea of lacking legal teeth so far to counter the realty boom in the area is being questioned. Environmentalist Pradip Chatterjee of Disha points to a 1992 high court ruling debarring development on the wetlands. ?What stopped them from acting on that ruling?? 

 Though welcoming the move, Banani Kakkar of PUBLIC, which had filed the petition prompting the ruling, pointed out how a series of violations had been reported earlier.

 A demolition order may sound dramatic, but the fact is that all such constructions have supporting documents from some government body or the other, admit officials.

 ?Any eco-unfriendly construction should not be allowed in the first place to avoid confusion and hardship for the stakeholders,? said an official of the builders? lobby Credai-Bengal.

 Business of art

 Boney Kapoor and Sushmita Sen at a city hotel

 Mr India, Roop Ki Rani Choron Ka Raja, Shakti, Kyun? Ho Gaya Na, Matrubhoomi, Hum Paanch. It is easy to pick the last two as the odd ones out in the list of entertainers. But Boney Kapoor is the link between the two disparate schools of films. 

 Lounging in a city hotel, Boney defends his association with serious cinema. ?I may have made films of other genres, but they have all been based on our culture. I have never made those quick-money films.? The finger is clearly at the flesh pots that have been making pots of money at the box office.

 Boney points out that 25 years ago, he had distributed a film like Sparsh. ?Naseer was blind in the Sai Paranjpe film.? Again, his first independent venture was Hum Paanch. ?It brought art and commerce together for the first time.? 

 Today, Boney feels, the divide is gone. ?Cinema has taken a more real approach. Thanks to multiplexes, films of all kinds can be exploited as revenue-making models.? 

 Overseas revenue has emerged as a lucrative source. ?A Shah Rukh Khan-starrer recovers its entire cost from the overseas sector,? he smiles.

 Satellite rights is a new window. ?You have different types of films being shown on individual channels.? The next big thing, he says, is Internet collections. ?Ringtones are already adding value to film rights. Movie on demand will come soon. For that, the Conditional Access System has to be in place, though.?

 Black may have been a sensitive film, but it still featured the biggest superstars of Bollywood. Yet, Boney refuses to accept that star power is essential. ?You can plan your residual revenue in such a way that you do not have to depend on hall collections. We spent about Rs 3-3.5 crore on Matrubhoomi. The film will not lose money even if it is not a big hit.?

 He had turned to television in 2003. ?Why? For money,? the booming laugh echoes in the lounge. Malini Iyer ran for 104 episodes, but did not become a Jassi or a Kyunki Saas? ?But it turned around the prospects of a new channel. If it did not do better that is because somewhere down the line, things were not handled properly.? Still, he refuses to accept that Sahara was the wrong launchpad for Sridevi?s TV debut. ?She was appreciated. That?s what matters.? Sridevi now is back to raising the kids ? Jahnvi, 8, and Khushi, 5. 

 Boney is now busy with the release of No Entry (Anil Kapoor, Salman, Fardeen and Bipasha) and Bachke Rehna Re Baba (Mallika Sherawat and Rekha). He has launched a production house called BSK Network and Entertainment, named after himself and his wife. ?I have made 31 films so far. I plan to make 30 more.?

Whos sane, us or them?

Paro. Picture by Reshmi Sengupta

Getting her to talk for even 10 minutes seemed a remote 

possibility. While her cast members made the most of their spare time making their 

way around Paro valley, the director of 15, Park Avenue stuck to the sets, 

surrounded by a loop of wires, white screens and camera.

Reshmi Sengupta did manage to catch up with 

APARNA SEN over dinner at Hotel Gangtey Palace, Paro, after the second day?s shoot 

in Bhutan.

Do you have some sort of a fascination for addresses 

or is it a sheer coincidence that two of your films have addresses as names?

It is a coincidence, but a happy one I think. 

In 36 Chowringhee Lane, we never showed 36 Chowringhee Lane as an address. 

It was more descriptive of the Anglo-Indian ambience, Chowringhee being a very 

significant name. I didn?t even know such a lane actually existed, though it didn?t 

add up to 36. But 15, Park Avenue is an address that becomes a metaphor 

for a much greater search; a search for the unattainable, so to say.

There was a challenged character in Paromitar 

Ekdin and there?s another in 15, Park Avenue. Why?

I am concerned with challenged people and I feel they 

have been tremendously marginalised in our films. That?s why I was so happy when 

I heard Black was being made on a challenged character. I have had personal 

experiences with schizophrenics. In 15, Park Avenue, Meethi (Konkona Sen 

Sharma) is a schizophrenic and I have raised the whole question of sanity. Who 

is sane? Is it us, or is it them? The film has a straight narrative and I think 

everyone will be able to follow it.

There are several new faces in your team this time? 

How did Waheeda Rehman and Dhritiman Chatterjee come into the picture?

I had not really asked Waheedaji because I 

didn?t think she would agree. But Shabana said she is a real trooper and she might 

do it. So, we decided to ask her. Then Shabana called up Waheedaji and 

she just said ?yes?. She plays Shabana and Konkona?s mother. As far as Sundar 

(Dhritiman) is concerned, I hadn?t seen him in a long time. I had worked with 

him in 36 Chowringhee Lane but didn?t know if he was acting anymore. Then 

I heard he was, indeed, and had just done Black. Sundar plays Meethi?s 

psychiatrist; I needed an actor of his age. Initially Naseer (Naseeruddin Shah) 

was supposed to do the role. 

Why did you choose cinematographer Hemant Chaturvedi?

I loved Hemant?s work in Maqbool. He was particularly 

very good in the film though I had also liked his Company and Makdee. 

Hemant and I wanted to work together for a long time. He was also supposed to 

do Gulel. 

After Paromitar Ekdin, you haven?t acted 

in any film, your own or others??

Well... let?s put it in this way. Acting in my films 

is not one of my aspirations. I write my own films and it gives me a lot of fulfilment. 

Acting (in others? films) has not given me that kind of fulfilment, because it 

still is somebody else?s vision.

Is there any special reason for 15, Park Avenue 

to be made in English?

Bengali films have a very limited market, a limited 

budget. If you are making a Bengali film, say, at a crore, you constantly need 

to cut corners, which is very difficult. If you are making a film in Hindi, Bollywood 

producers will want stars and then the whole thing changes. Certain things need 

to be worked in to bring back the money. There?s a market for English films and 

there is also an overlap between the audiences of English and Bengali films.

Are these the reasons why Gulel didn?t work 

out?

With Gulel we had a lot of complications. After 

Pritish Nandy and I parted ways, Gulel was supposed to be financed by someone 

else. But the executive producer of the project fell ill and our dates went haywire. 

By that time, it was too late for the actors to reschedule their dates. Then Goynar 

Baksho also didn?t happen for some reason. And I was dying to make a film. 

So I started working on 15, Park Avenue.

So, you wouldn?t compromise to get a film going?

Stars are good for getting the audiences. But I won?t 

change the storyline to accommodate stars, or put an item number or write a scene 

for a certain actor that gives him scope to show his histrionics. I have made 

a lot of compromises for many years, acting in films I didn?t like. Of course, 

those gave me money but I was never satisfied. Making films is one area of my 

life where I don?t want to be dishonest.

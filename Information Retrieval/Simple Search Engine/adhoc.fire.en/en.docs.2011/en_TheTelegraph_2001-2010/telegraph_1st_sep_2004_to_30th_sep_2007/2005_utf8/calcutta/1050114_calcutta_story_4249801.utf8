The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Defence bid to devalue evidence

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY AND JULIUS GOMES 

 The tears were suppressed, though the strain showed. 

 Appearing at the Alipore court of sub-divisional judicial magistrate Manjit Singh for the third time in as many days, Munni Devi, mother of 17-year-old Rajnis Patel, wore a determined look as she answered a volley of questions by the defence lawyers on Thursday.

 Tapan Choudhury, representing accused doctor Nirmalya Basu, focussed on the contradictions between the evidence and statements made by Munni Devi in court.

 The questions, though seemingly irrelevant, were aimed at exposing loopholes:

 ?When the police were conducting their investigation, you did not tell them that Rajnis had been bleeding continuously even after the operations, did you??

 ?You had not mentioned to the police that Rajnis was running a high fever in the post-surgical period, and that his injured leg had swollen up??

 ?After Rajnis? death, you went to Bihar to perform his last rites. So, why did you not tell the police about it??

 ?You had named only one doctor in the FIR, but the names of the four other doctors were later added to the list. You didn?t know them until the police pointed them out to you, did you??

 Munni Devi asserted that she had told police everything that she has said in court.

 After hearing was adjourned for the day, defence lawyer Tapan Choudhury spoke to Metro about the case. 

 ?The allegation against the doctors is that they were negligent in treating Rajnis and are responsible for his death. However, since the parents had complained to the hospital superintendent, the onus cannot be put on the five doctors,? he said.

 If the court holds that the superintendent had known about negligence on the part of the doctors and did nothing, he may face charges of dereliction of duty.

 According to Choudhury, the statements made by Manoj Patel, Rajnis? father, were in contradiction with the police?s version of events.

 ?The junior doctors tried their best to save Rajnis. It was more than a question of responsibility for them,? Choudhury asserted.

 ?They were aware that a shadow would be cast on their careers and they may not get their MS degrees if they were negligent. Moreover, till the fourth operation, other doctors, who haven?t been named, were involved in the treatment,? Choudhury said.

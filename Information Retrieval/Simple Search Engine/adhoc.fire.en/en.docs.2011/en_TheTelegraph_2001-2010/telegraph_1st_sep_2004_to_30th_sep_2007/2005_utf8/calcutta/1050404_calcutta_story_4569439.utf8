The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Let there be more light in school classrooms

 - Straining 

could harm eyes 

 The Bureau of Indian Standards has set norms for illumination in classrooms. Sadly, the schools aren?t even aware of the code. A Telegraph picture

 Does your child complain of recurring headaches and watery eyes? Has he suddenly started behaving in a listless manner? Have you gone for an eye check-up and discovered to your woe that he has developed power? The reason may not be excessive study load or genetic weakness or straining from the last bench in the class, as are commonly perceived, but insufficient lighting in classrooms. 

 City based ophthalmologist P.B. Sarkar explains that ?insufficient light in classrooms strains the eyes of students. To maintain a healthy vision, at least a 100-watt lamp must be projected on the study table of the child over his shoulder. When this is not done and the child continues to study in poor light, his retina is strained. This causes enlarging of the retina and subsequent reduction in his vision.?

 The Bureau of Indian Standard (BIS) states that a minimum of 45 ft-candle of illumination is required for a 100-sq-ft classroom. According to this standard, there should be at least three tubelights of 40 watts each in a 100-sq-ft classroom so that there is adequate illumination per square foot of the floor area of a classroom.

 The standard has been fixed in such a way that even as it provides enough illumination for the classroom, it does not cause excessive consumption of electricity.

 ?Our task is to only develop this standard. We cannot enforce it in schools,? said V.K. Sehgal, director-general (east), BIS. ?We have a standard for every lighting condition, including one for the schools. Though we cannot enforce the standard, if there is a gross violation of lighting systems and people lodge complaints with us, we can check it as per our standards,? he added.

 City-based schools, on the other hand, say that they are not aware of any standard for lighting classrooms. Gillian Rosemary Hart, principal of Welland Gouldsmith School, said: ?Our classrooms are very well lit but we don?t know of any such standard. I doubt if most schools have heard of it. In any case, we have at least four to five tubelights in each classroom, which has a capacity of accommodating 40 to 45 students.?

 Neville Arora, principal of Nopany Vidyalaya and deputy rector of both Pretoria High School and Nopany, agreed. ?Even we are not aware of the standard. However, we have taken special care of the lighting system at Pretoria, where for every three desks, we have a special light that emits diffused illumination over a limited area. At Nopany, there are nine tubelights in a 400 to 500-sq-ft class.? 

 The validating authority for the lighting standard of schools is the district inspector of schools of that area. Dulal Das, inspector of schools (secondary), North 24-Parganas, said: ?We can exercise our authority only over government schools. We do not have any control over private schools, be it secondary or primary. Hence, we do not have any authority either to instruct them to adopt any correctional measures or to intervene in their working conditions.?

 He added that even government schools did not have an adequate lighting system, as specified by the BIS.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee wants a modern mass transit system in Rajarhat, far removed from the mess prevailing in Calcutta.

 Last week, Bhattacharjee had asked housing minister and Hidco chairman Goutam Deb to ensure that New Town gets a pollution-free, comfortable transport system.

 To start with, the government will initiate steps to deploy modern buses, including air-conditioned ones, in the township. 

 Private players will be asked to procure buses that look good, have comfortable seats, run on modern technology and are Bharat Stage II compliant.

 The housing minister has assigned the responsibility of working out the plan to transport secretary and Hidco managing director Sumantra Chowdhury. 

 ?We are exploring the possibilities of introducing quality bus services in Rajarhat. We?re looking for private operators who can introduce air-conditioned, aerodynamic buses with smart bodies,? Chowdhury said on Wednesday. The services will be launched on a small scale, he added. 

 The chief minister has been consistent in his effort to change Calcutta?s mass transport system. 

 Ten companies have expressed interest, in response to global tenders floated by the state government, in running a light-rail transit system and mono-rail in the city.

 As for Rajarhat, transport department officials pointed out that the challenge lay in finding economically viable routes as the government was not willing to subsidise operations. 

 ?The department is working on routes that fit into the overall transport requirements of the township,? a transport official said.

 Almost all major transport operators have welcomed the move, but with a note of caution. Bengal Bus Syndicate president Swarnakamal Saha said the government?s decision was futuristic and that the economics needed to be worked out first.

 ?We welcome the decision, but the government has to work out a passenger transport policy. We also need a committee to work out the fare structure,? he added. 

 Sadhan Das, secretary of Joint Council of Bus Syndicates, said his organisation was eager to provide modern transport to New Town residents, but only after assessing the routes and the fares.

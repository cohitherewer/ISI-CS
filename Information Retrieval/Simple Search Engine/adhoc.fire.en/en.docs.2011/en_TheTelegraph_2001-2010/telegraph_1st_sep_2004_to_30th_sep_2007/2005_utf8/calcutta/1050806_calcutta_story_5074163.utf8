The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 An ear for changeover chimes

Eye on Calcutta

 Ronu Roy

 The subcontinent?s first modern city is shedding the decay and anachronism of decades for an urban renewal

 New Market and a new coffee shop: Tradition beside the trendy

 Gradually, almost imperceptibly, a noticeably new mood seems to have crept into Calcutta, an unusual optimism has hit the streets; the young are walking differently with a new swing in their gait. 

 When did this happen? Why could we not pre-empt or predict that it would? It is always impossible to tell exactly when these transformations happen, but when it does, it happens unobtrusively over a period of time, like the number of five-star hotel rooms that doubled, or perhaps trebled, in our city in the recent past. I can still hear the dwindling echoes when it all began, and the usual prophets of doom who said that the rooms would go empty. Who wants to come to Cal, yaar?

 But people seem to be coming from all corners of the world, and one does not hear desperate disaster stories from hoteliers anymore. Supermarkets have come, at first tentatively, one at a time, now in a flood. Who thought you would ever buy bheendi or potol wrapped in clinging clear plastic! But you can now, and increasingly more of us are doing it, at prices that are even raising concerned eyebrows in Jagu Babu?s Bazaar. 

 Smart shopping malls for us had long been just locations for Hollywood thrillers, or something to gape at on visits to Gurgaon. But they too have arrived, along with the multiplexes, pizza parlours, and coffee places that have nothing to do with College Street intelligentsia. The arrival in our city of an unusual visitor like Paco Underhill, the international style guru of designer shopping malls, is interesting, but his reaction is even more intriguing. Old, dowdy, broken down, decrepit New Market, where even a yawn made you vulnerable to a health hazard, was the one that impressed him the most by the uniqueness of its character.

 Maybe we will redefine progress in our own terms rather than just copy it from the rest of the world. One of our swank new bookstores was, recently, the venue of a major seminar on experimental theatre on the occasion of a theatre festival organised by one of the mobile phone companies. Neither of these organisations would have dared to do something like that in Gurgaon or Noida, or in few other Indian cities for that matter. 

 Events like these, especially when they are swarmed by hosts of young people, assure me that we will create examples in the future, as we have done in the past. But one must understand the present. Perhaps only then will we be able to interpret and utilise it to our advantage, both individually and as a community. The here and the now is created in the matrix of our yesterdays, and it builds the pathways to our tomorrows. Only the pace that is sometimes built up along the road may be nerve shattering if we are not prepared for it.

 Yes, Calcutta is upbeat today, a city in metamorphosis, exuding a new confidence whose nouveau riche brashness you may not always enjoy, but which you may ignore only to your own peril. If you have not taken the new road to the airport, off the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, then you must do so soon. Because it is like a huge blank canvas, on which new pictures will be painted within the next decade. 

 I can remember the dusty expanses of arid Gurgaon which no one would believe when they see it today. What is this new picture and where does it come from? Perhaps the genesis of the new change that I am talking about was present in the womb of the past. Perhaps it is a totally new phenomenon. But that the laid-back city?s habitual lack of initiative is being replaced by new energy is something you cannot avoid or miss. Something I feel that Calcutta is just following that inevitable law of nature, according to which you have go up, once you have reached the bottom of the barrel. 

 The first modern city to be built in the subcontinent, Calcutta was faced with the inevitability of decay and anachronism that all pioneers have to encounter. It is the same inevitability coming around in its full cycle that is creating perhaps our first experience of urban renewal. 

 Developmental pundits always say that you must follow the money to find an answer to the kind of conundrum I am proposing. And Calcutta always had money in the past. The character of that money has certainly charged. The industries, like jute or engineering, which kept Calcutta afloat, have in time run aground. Most of them have become obsolete, because no one infused new technological blood into them. On top of that, demands changed, products became redundant, the world moved on. Inexpensive options slaughtered the old technologies. So Calcutta slowly withered away as a manufacturing town. 

 I am no longer sure if the history of our trade unionism, often understood as the bogey that killed progress, was the reason for the downslide of business in our city or whether it was an index that all was not well with the traditional manufacturing that this city had grown-up with. Did irresponsible trade unionism or the demon of work culture destroy us, or were these the inevitable and irresponsible manifestations of business that had too long been grounded on outmoded and inefficient technologies? Look carefully at the industrial wastelands that still stand by on the fringes of our city and you will know that the economy did go out of gear. When it happens on such a scale, the reasons have to be many.

 Today those very same industrial wastelands are among the places where the fruits of the new enthusiasm can be seen most prominently. It happened in Mumbai earlier, when derelict textile mills were converted into prime real estate. It is happening now in our own city. Is the new Calcutta less sentimental then, less attached to the past, or wallowing less in mistaken tradition and heritage? I am not sure if these are questions or conundrums.

 Like civilisations, cities rise and fall, and rise again. The city we today know as Istanbul has been called by more than a hundred names in different times of its long antiquity that began with the Phoenicians. I feel greatly encouraged and enthused that probably the same is happening to our beloved city. 

 An upbeat Calcutta is a welcome departure from a downcast one. But the expectation that thrills me even more is that the new spirit will certainly express itself in the arts. How it will do so is something worth watching, and waiting for. I am confident that Calcutta?s artists, working in the gamut of different genres, will certainly respond to the transformation. We may not all like what will see, but the promise that we will see something new and different is, I believe, absolutely certain. 

 Next time your experience takes you in front of a cultural expression of the city and its experiences, do remember to look carefully and keenly, with your ears close to the ground. Something is happening, and the rewards of cottoning on it early will be greatly satisfying. It would also indicate that you are close to the throb of life as it pulsates to a new rhythm. It may help you contribute your own melody to the New Calcutta Cacophony. Of course, it is chaos now, but from where else can cosmos emerge?

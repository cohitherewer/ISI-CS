 Poetry in motion

 Based on the concept of dance-theatre, Versedance is a unique mode of creative expression that brings together poetry, music, dance and art to give birth to an abstract, independent performing genre. This afternoon?s performance successfully connects and interlaces the emotional essence of poetry and the spontaneous, rhythmic responses evoked by dance. In it, the uniqueness of Versedance as a form has been harnessed in using it as a mode of alternative education; as a way of adding a fresh dimension and an original, dynamic perspective to poetical texts taught in colleges and universities. Liberating the text from the domain of traditional interpretation, the performance is built around T.S. Eliot?s literary masterpiece, Preludes. It is presented by a team of more than 30 students who have collaborated on all aspects of this performance under the creative directorship of choreographer Jhuma Basak. Supported by India Foundation for the Arts, Bangalore.

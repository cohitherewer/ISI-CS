 Thrice wed, rejected bail

 - Jobless man arrested for triple marriage on wife?s complaint 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 A high court division bench on Wednesday rejected the bail plea of Sumit Roy, a resident of Bangur, arrested for marrying three women without divorcing any of them.

 Roy, who comes from a well-to-do family, does nothing to earn a living. 

 His first marriage was with Tandra Hazra in 1993. The marriage was registered and the couple had a son in 1995.

 Roy married Debdyuti Banerjee in June 1998 and Madhumita Gupta in April 2004. Both marriages were registered. Though he tried to keep each of his three wives in the dark about the other two, information of the third marriage reached his ?second wife? shortly. The two women ? Madhumita and Debdyuti ? then contacted each other and started spying on their husband.

 They talked to several people close to Roy and soon learnt about his first wife and his son. Debdyuti then lodged a complaint with Lake Town police station and Roy was arrested early this year. His bail plea was twice rejected by the Barasat court.

 On Wednesday, his lawyer argued before the high court bench of Justice Amit Talukdar and Justice S.P. Mitra that though Roy had been arrested on the basis of Debdyuti?s complaint, no evidence had been produced to prove her allegations.

 The lawyer submitted that Roy was ?a respectable citizen, who will not leave the city even after being released on bail. He will help the investigating officer, as and when necessary?. 

 Opposing the plea, additional public prosecutor Ashimesh Goswami said: ?Sumit Roy should not be granted bail. He is one of those who appear decent from the outside, but are actually a menace to society. What right had he to ruin the lives of three women??

 At this point, the judges asked Goswami what Roy?s profession was and whether the marriage registration certificates could be produced in court.

 Goswami replied that police had obtained all three marriage registration certificates. ?According to police, Roy does nothing. But the women he married are all employed,? the prosecutor told the bench. He argued that if Roy was released on bail, he would marry yet another woman. 

 Hearing the submissions of both sides, the bench rejected the bail prayer.

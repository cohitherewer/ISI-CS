The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Silver lining in blackout

 - Positive parleys spark hopes of weekend beam return

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 Will most of Calcutta be able to catch Sania Mirza?s progress at the Australian Open, or maybe Chelsea?s cruise to the English Premier League crown?

 The answer could, finally, be yes, even as the ESPN STAR Sports blackout on Indian Cable Net (formerly RPG Netcom) and Manthan, covering over half of city cable and satellite homes, enters its eighth week.

 Though both broadcaster ESPN STAR Sports and the two multi-system operators are mouthing the standard ?discussions-are-on-in-a-positive-manner? line, the word from the beam boardroom is that a resolution is ready to be reached by this weekend.

According to sources, the bickering parties have mutually 

sorted out most of the thorny issues, with a government-backed arbitrator overseeing 

proceedings. ?But, going by past experiences, till the channels actually return 

to the screens, there?s no certainty,? sources warned.

ESPN STAR Sports had switched off its beam on the 

two networks owing to dues dispute running into crores.

One of the reasons for the delay in a resolution has 

been the lack of cricket featuring Team India on the channels.

Cricket, clearly, is the big draw. Till now, 

ESPN STAR Sports always had most of Indian cricket which allowed it to dictate 

terms. Now, its different, said an operator.

The only bit, the India-Bangladesh Test and ODIs, 

saw a state government intervention forcing temporary truce. The broadcaster had 

to switch on beam for the duration of the matches on Indian Cable Net and Manthan.

But most of Calcutta missed much more than cricket 

in the two months.

If English Premier League, Champions League and Spanish 

League comprised the list of super soccer action, cricket content included matches 

between Australia and Pakistan, New Zealand and Sri Lanka and South Africa and 

England.

Sporting action on ESPN STAR Sports in the near future 

includes the final stages of Champions League and English Premier League, cricket 

featuring Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, the Formula One season getting 

underway and the winner of Harsha ki Khoj, ESPNs being announced.

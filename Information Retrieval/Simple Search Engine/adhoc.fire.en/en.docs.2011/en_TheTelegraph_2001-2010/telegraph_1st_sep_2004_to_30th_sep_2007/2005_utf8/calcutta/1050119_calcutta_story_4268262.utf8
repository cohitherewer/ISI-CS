 Keep a date with trivia trove

SANGITA SULTANIA G. ROY

 In case you are yet to receive a diary to your satisfaction, 

gift yourself or those who share the same predicament, one that goes beyond the 

mere purpose of jotting notes. Quirky quotes to make you smile, travel and business 

details that double as your personal assistant, and even Vedic advice on the auspices 

of a day or time ? diaries have come a long way from being just utility notepads. 

 While the usual leather-bound varieties can be picked up from any corner stationery store, brands like Nightingale, Tata Donnelly, Anika, Eagle and Penguin Desk Companion present fancier options. 

There are several varieties on offer to suit the mood 

and needs of the user (picture by Rashbehari Das).

 What

cartoons and quotes

The Organise and Smile diary from Nightingale features a small cartoon on each page along with a tongue-in-cheek quote to lift the spirits before a hard day?s work. The Penguin India Desk Companion features more laughs with trivia on public personalities along with an R.K. Laxman caricature on each page. 

 Then there are traveller?s diaries with specific sections on destination, transport, accommodation and sightseeing to make for easy planning and maintaining records. The Vedic Cosmos diary that specifies the auspicious and inauspicious time periods on each day of the year, features quotes from the Bhagwad Gita, shlokas and dates according to the Hindi calendar. 

 At the other end of the spectrum are financial diaries, aimed at corporates. These pack in extensive information like the Top 100 Indian companies, the Top 50 Asian companies and the Top 100 US companies, along with tips about making sense of a balance sheet, investing in stocks and more. Then there are diaries with in-built planners from brands like Anika. 

 The exterior has also decked up in velvet and leather options. Some brands have even taken care to use eco-friendly wood-free paper.

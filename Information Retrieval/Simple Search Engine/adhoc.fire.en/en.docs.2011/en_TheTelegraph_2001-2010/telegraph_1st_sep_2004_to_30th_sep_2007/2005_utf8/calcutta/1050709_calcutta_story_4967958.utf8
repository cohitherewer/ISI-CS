 The City Diary

 The high court on Friday ordered the Botanical Survey of India (BSI) to impose an entry fee on visitors to Botanical Garden, Shibpur, from August 15.

 he BSI was also asked to take stern action against 46 of the 200 gardeners who were allegedly involved in a ?violent movement? against the authorities and were abstaining from work. ?If you can?t have the guards tackle them, quit your post, quot; a division bench, presided over by Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar, told BSI joint director S.G. Giri.

 The bench also ordered the authorities to arrange for round-the-clock vigil of the Great Banyan Tree, reintroduce a ferry service between Calcutta and Botanical Garden, renovate the garden?s jetty within six months and restore Willam Rox Burgea?s museum on the compound as early as possible.

 he order followed a petition by environment activist Subhash Dutta, who had accused the garden authorities of mismanagement. 

 The high court on Friday came down on the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) for not submitting an affidavit stating steps it had taken to eradicate malaria from the city. When the CMC lawyer prayed for time, Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar expressed the fear that 200 more people might die of the disease by the time the affidavit would be filed. The court was hearing a public interest litigation by advocate Pradip Roy, who alleged that the civic body had misappropriated funds allocated for malaria eradication. The authorities were finally allowed another two weeks to file the affidavit.

 Subhendu Chakraborty, a 24-year-old student of an engineering college in Nagpur, drowned at Digha on Friday afternoon. Subhendu, a resident of Garia, arrived at the sea resort in the morning with six friends. 

 The Bondel Road flyover is expected to be completed by December, PWD minister Amar Choudhury told the Assembly on Friday. Work started 10 years ago, when the project cost was estimated at Rs 10 crore. It has now escalated to Rs 13 crore. The main reason for the delay, Choudhury said, is that the flyover is coming up in a congested area. Much time was taken up convincing the people to vacate the place. ?We could not have used steamrollers to remove them? the question of their relocation also needed to be addressed?? he explained. 

 esides, the minister alleged, the railway?s share of the project cost was disbursed much later. A reason for the cost escalation is the hike in the price of steel, he said. 

 The results of BA, B.Sc and B.Com (honours) Part II examinations of Calcutta University are likely to be announced next week, officials said on Friday. The examinations were held in March. Around 36,000 students sat for the tests.

 The high court on Friday directed the state government to file an affidavit stating steps it had taken for regular monitoring of the health of the inmates of Liluah rescue home, as recommended by West Bengal Human Rights Commission. In its report, the panel has stated that 119 inmates of the home are being looked after by only one doctor. Petitioner Tapas Bhanja informed the court that even the lone doctor had been transferred and sick inmates were being treated by a compounder. 

 MLAs on Friday expressed concern in the Assembly over Thursday?s blasts in London. The matter was raised by Left Front?s Rabin Deb.

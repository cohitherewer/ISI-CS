 A world within four-poster

 A bout of illness made Samir Mukerjee realise the strength of human spirit and the hidden virtues of those who are taken for granted

 Experiences vary ? some pleasant and enriching, some searing and debilitating. In the month of July 1959, I became indisposed with a running temperature and a niggling headache. The usual mixtures were given to bring the fever down and paracetalmols to relieve the headache. 

 On the third day getting up from the commode seemed an impossible feat. I felt the tremors of polio for the first time. The right shoulder refused to obey me and the left leg was even more rebellious, denuded of every ounce of strength. At the same time, the fingers of the left hand couldn?t be straightened. It seemed a concerted attack on different parts of the body like the Baghdad suicide bombers who unleash a string of attacks on different targets at the same time. After a lumber puncture, polio was diagnosed and that meant imprisonment in bed for an indefinite period.

 Nurses had to be brought in at once to take care of all my needs ? I was as helpless as a new born babe and the limpness of the body surprised me no end. While I was in this state of devastation, my grandfather sent for Dr. B.C. Roy to look me over and suggest immediate remedies. He towered over me with a benign expression on his face and recommended the name of Dr. S.K. Banerjee, a formidable specialist in physical medicine. Dr. Banerjee was handsome with immaculate bedside manners. He exuded confidence and never stopped smiling when he was dealing with my ravaged body. 

 Hot water sponges formed part of my treatment along with a host of vitamins. Insomnia had set in and sedatives had to be taken regularly. When the appetite plummeted, Asaminos did the trick effortlessly. 

 The doctors couldn?t get over the fact that I was never depressed for a single day. The discomfort was crucifying and the immobility could have led to a feeling of desolation. I didn?t give up humming my favourite melodies and occasionally laughed at the jokes of the benevolent and efficient Anglo-Indian nurses. Goodness knows where this sense of resignation came from. One had heard about divine intervention, and this could be it.

 Sister Eunice Von Lintzgy was my day nurse, while Sister May Gomes came at night and was eternally vigilant. Both of them were almost as good as doctors when it came to spotting the patient?s problems. 

 This was the time when someone gave me Ayn Rand?s Fountainhead and Francoise Sagan?s Bon jour Tristesse. They suited my mind at that moment. The radio was placed just behind my head and I was treated to a spate of pop songs by Connie Francis, Jim Reeves, Dean Martin, Pat Boone, Elvis Presley and the Beatles to name a few. Since I was never unduly bored, the music, books and conversation with the nurses helped me pass the time rather agreeably. Friends came in droves to entertain and amuse me. 

 The St. Xavier?s Fathers came regularly, giving me a glimpse of their innate compassion and solicitude for the sick and infirm. That?s when I realised how kind and caring they were. I felt the warmth of their healing touch. Father George D?Campo sent me a rosary from Kurseong where he was completing his novitiate. The rosary, somehow, gave me a sense of strength and couldn?t have been a more effective talisman. The ailing Father J. de Gheldere, tall and stately, dignified and aristocratic, came more often than the others. He talked about St. Francis of Assisi and the remarkable transformation he underwent when Christ?s simple message got through to him. 

 Another regular visitor was Father Ferdinand Mairlot, who was my Preparatory Senior class teacher in the year 1946. We didn?t lose touch with each other till he died in Australia last year. This illness brought me very close to my school and college teachers. Such revelations were infinitely rewarding. It?s only in a crisis that one discovers so many hidden virtues in those we take for granted.

 The rehabilitation was slow and steady. I was allowed to get out of bed after one year when I had to be almost trained to cross the threshold, take the first few tentative steps to the verandah, negotiate the staircase, climbing slowly and descending with even greater care. After a few weeks of this, I was taken down to the garden with calipers fitted to my left leg. One day I found myself getting into my car for a drive to the Strand with the day nurse in attendance. 

 While the progress left nothing to be desired, a nervous cough began to give me endless trouble. This went on so long that I was compelled to fall back on cortisone tabets for short durations. When I was in a position to go out to the cinema or to Calcutta Club for dinner, I was exposed to the danger of slipping and falling and that is just what happened a number of times. Once it was in front of the Lighthouse, at other times I collapsed in the house itself. With nasty bruises and hairlines fractures, I had to be laid up in bed for weeks. 

 Much later when I became more active socially, I ran into new areas of darkness. The sacro iliac joint was deteriorating fast and a low back pain became my constant companion. The spine was affected by my irregular gait due to a pronounced drop foot on the left side. I can imagine the discs wearing away rapidly. This gave me constriction in the chest or girdle sensation and brought on cervical spondylosis. As if this wasn?t enough, a sharp sciatica pain would shoot from the left hip to the knee. All this meant a regular intake of lethal painkillers which could have done a lot of lasting damage. 

 I had to visit Dr. S.K. Banerjee?s chamber whenever there was a flare-up and things got out of hand. I was administered diathermy, ultrasonic and neck and hip traction and even hydrocortisone injections when the back pain proved too obdurate and I longed for a semblance of normality in my life. 

 One can never expect the buffettings to cease. They send out the message that we reek of mortality and life is evanescent. 

 In spite of it all there are compensations in nature?s benedictions and the affection showered on me by wellwishers. A certain basic innocence stays behind. It remains, somehow, magnetically in one?s life, remains as something quick and alive and utterly safe from the mechanical and the dreary. I would love to end on a note of affirmation: 

 ?My heart leaps up when I behold 

 A rainbow in the sky

 So was it when my life began 

 So is it now I am a man 

 So be it when I shall grow old 

 Or let me did.? 

 Since Wordsworth has said it all, there is no need to add anything more. 

 Polio could not break my spirit.

 Cut-price mobile seller arrested

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Even a few days ago, any expensive mobile phone could be got at half price from Ramzan Mollah of Mollar Gate, Rampur, in Jinjira Bazaar, on the southern fringes of the city. 

 Mollah did brisk business along with two accomplices, and customers came to know of him by word of mouth. 

 On Thursday night, acting on a tip-off, a police team led by Rameshwar Ozha, officer-in-charge of Jinjira Bazaar police station, laid a trap and arrested Ramzan and his two accomplices. About 110 mobile phones, costing more than Rs 11 lakh, was seized from them. 

 Ramzan started his new business from May-end. If a buyer ever asked him any question about the genuineness of a handset, he assured him that he should take it without hesitation. Anyway, he was selling it at half the price. 

 A well-known cell phone company, which has its godown at Mollar Gate, had complained to Jinjira Bazaar police station on May 28 that the previous night, the godown had been burgled, and about 130 mobile phones were missing. The thieves had sneaked in after breaking the asbestos roof, said South 24-Parganas district superintendent of police S.N.Gupta. 

 A senior officer of Jinjira Bazaar police station said Ramzan and his accomplices were past masters in repairing mobile phones. ?Earlier, they used to sell second-hand mobiles. So, people who bought sets from him, had no doubt about the brand,? he said.

 On Thursday, when the police came to know of this, an officer of the police station went to Mollar Gate and met Ramzan, posing as a customer. 

 ?After some deliberations when he brought out five new cell phones, our men rounded him up and his two accomplices,? said the officer.

 During interrogation, Ramzan confessed that he had sold 20 cell phones within two weeks. Earlier, he had stolen cell phones from the shops where he worked as a mechanic. His accomplices stole such a huge number of mobile phones as someone had placed an order. But that man failed to pay the money he had promised. So they were being sold in retail. Police are looking for the kingpin of this racket.

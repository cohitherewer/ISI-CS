The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Calcutta captured, through their eyes only

As part of an exchange programme with SRFTI, 15 German film 

students are in town to shoot the city as they see it as a dog, through 

traffic, in the middle of a game of carrom, in the steps of a Kathak dancer and 

more, finds out Pratim D. Gupta

The Caf? Coffee Days, Baristas and Coffee Pais need 

to do a rethink. Or maybe a re-brew. Their espresso is just not good enough for 

the 15 German students from the Film and Television Institute, Konrad Wolf in 

Potsdam, who have camped in Calcutta for more than a month as part of the exchange 

programme with Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute (SRFTI).

?That?s the only thing we have really missed from 

the time we have been here. The Coffee House coffee is ok but it?s quite far off,? 

says Daniel Lang, whose film Grief, based on a Chekhov short story, is 

not only a rage at international student film fairs but has won at other prestigious 

short film festivals as well.

Daniel is now shooting a short film in Calcutta. ?It?s 

about me, how I get run over by a lorry and then get reincarnated as a dog. I 

experience the city of Calcutta as a dog, who also dies at the end,? reveals the 

young film-maker.

Like Daniel, all the 15 students are trying to capture 

Calcutta as they see it and trying to can a classic like Till Passow?s award-winning 

documentary Howrah Howrah, which was made as a part of the German Festival 

in India in 2000-01. ?It would be interesting to see how these students, who represent 

fresh German cinema, capture Calcutta?s images,? says Passow, who is currently 

in Calcutta trying to help the students in their endeavour. ?For me, it?s like 

coming back home,? he adds.

If this an exciting project for the Potsdam people, 

it?s a first-of-a-kind for the students at SRFTI. ?The success of this exchange 

programme will lead to many such ventures in the near future,? says SRFTI lecturer 

Biren Das Sharma, who is co-ordinating the programme. ?In April, eight of our 

third-year direction students will go to Germany and be part of a workshop in 

Potsdam. While they wouldn?t be making films like the German students, the workshop 

experience will certainly help them understand the craft of film-making better.?

The junior SRFTI students, in their first and second 

years, have come forward to help their German counterparts capture their Calcutta 

capers on celluloid. ?They have been extremely helpful and we have simply loved 

the SRFTI campus ? it?s like a village in a town,? says Markus F. Adrian, working 

on a romantic thriller, with the city as backdrop, that reaches a crescendo over 

a game of carrom.

For Mexican Florencia Hurtado, whose first film was 

about the autobiographical conflict between missing her dead mother and beginning 

a new life in Germany, the Calcutta mosquitoes were too much too handle. ?Some 

of them love us too much,? she laughs. ?As for my film, I am trying to capture 

the Calcutta traffic and how life rolls on in a junction here.?

Howrah Howrah 

Dirk Hilbert, who had earlier documented the sad story 

of the trained dogs in Hollywood showbiz, has chosen to capture young city dancer 

Kasturi Mishra for his Calcutta project. ?Through her I want to show the next 

generation of kathak dancing in this country,? explains Dirk.

The young German voice has also resonated beyond Calcutta. 

Heiko Aufdermauer, who had earlier made a documentary on two boys forced to leave 

their to-be-bulldozed village, is spinning a fable around the idol makers of Kumartuli. 

?The one problem we had during shooting is that the local folks thought we are 

making lakhs of money and not giving them anything,? says Heiko. ?People here 

need more money than we do in Germany, but they don?t realise that we don?t make 

any money from these films. In fact we don?t even pay actors who feature in the 

student films in Germany.?

The city streets have not been free of trouble. ?There 

have been many people who have tried to stop us from shooting saying, ?Don?t show 

India outside?,? says Daniel. ?Thankfully it all ended well and we could shoot 

what we wanted. But there have also been people who have been clapping at the 

end of a successful shot.?

As the eight SRFTI students gear up to head for the 

German greens, the 15 Potsdam students return to their school to sit at the post-production 

table with their raw footage. ?After all the heat, noise and dirt, they would 

get to edit their films back home,? says Martin Waelde, director of Goethe-Institut. 

?And once they are ready with their Calcutta films, we plan to premiere them here 

at the Short Film Festival in September. There is also talk of getting the films 

shown on German television by the end of the year.?

And what beckons back home? ?We would love to return 

to our usual cups of coffee but we would definitely miss the mosquitoes,? comes 

the chorus from the German guests.

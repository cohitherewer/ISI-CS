 Satyajit Ray would spend hours penning his scripts at the Park Street restaurant

 Circa 1952: Albert Schweitzer gets the peace Nobel. Women get voting rights in Greece. Calcutta gets its first north Indian cuisine restaurant?

 Kwality, at 17 Park Street, where Satyajit Ray used to ?spend hours penning his scripts? over endless cups of Cona coffee and cheese balls, remains much the same to this day to the city gourmand. The sprouting of new-age eateries and snazzy nightclubs has failed to dilute the heady aroma of its signature Pindi Chana, Paneer Kadhai or Fish Masala Kebab, as it stands out in its elegant simplicity.

 ?Yes, the city has been kind to us, but if we have managed to keep our nose above the water even when Park Street suffered an endemic slump, it?s due to an uncompromising approach towards quality,? asserts Baldev Ghai, partner and youngest among the seven siblings.

 His brother P.N. Ghai had fired the burners at the Park Street property after the country?s first Kwality was opened in Regal Building, New Delhi, in 1939. Since then, it has been the preferred rendezvous for distinctive north Indian and tandoori dishes in town.

 ?Back in the 50s and 60s, nearly 80 per cent of our clientele comprised Europeans. They came back for the Chicken Stroganoff and the Fried Fish with Tartar Sauce, since apart from Flury?s and Trinca?s, there was hardly any option on Park Street then,? recalls Ghai.

 Kwality, which has even had its fabled Pindi Chana, Fried Fish and Brain Masala airlifted to London, boasts an enduring tryst with the celluloid world. ?We have had the likes of Om Prakash, Vijay Anand, Shakti Samanta and Uttam Kumar frequenting our restaurant in the past, while Aparna Sen and Moon Moon Sen are among the regulars now,? says R.K. Bhatia, senior adviser. Bipasha Basu, too, had portions of the chatpata chana and kulcha packed on her way back to Mumbai recently.

 Nonetheless, the Ghais are not resting on their oars. ?It?s important to constantly reinvent and look ahead. So, we are experimenting with some new continental dishes and upgrading the existing menu,? explains Rajiv Ghai, who helps out father Baldev in chalking out tomorrow?s roadmap.

 The Ballygunge Phari property has just reopened following a three-and-a-half-month lockout. Kwality has taken its paratha rolls and fast food to Hangout, the food court at City Centre, while plans for a third property, ?preferably on the EM Bypass?, are being drawn up. While the Park Street restaurant has grown from 75 to 140 covers, including a mezzanine level, the Ghais are keen to stay focused on their core competence ? a quest for quality food. ?Our office is the restaurant floor and we are hands-on in the kitchen with the staff, checking the ingredients and monitoring the flavours so that the diners get the best fare on their plates,? says Rajiv.

 Delving deeper into Kwality?s curry cauldron, Ghai Senior points out: ?Nowadays, a lot of places do fry-pan food, with three or four standardised gravies as base. We cook every single dish separately and here, the Chicken Curry or the Rogan Josh are prepared in the traditional method, the way grandma used to make them.?

 Centre lifts land bar on hilsa imports

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Bengal will not have to spend a monsoon without the quintessential seasonal delicacies, like bhapa or shorshey ilish.

 A trade embargo, imposed by the Centre, on land import of the fish from Bangladesh, had created much furore as it spawned the prospect of Bengalis being starved of hilsa on this side of the border. But on Tuesday, the state government announced that the embargo had been lifted.

 ?The Central government sent us an amended notification today, stating that the embargo has been lifted. This means traders are allowed to import hilsa through the land border in Petrapole,? fisheries minister Kiranmoy Nanda said at Writers? Buildings. 

 The Centre, however, asked the state to ensure that the quality of the fish being imported through the land route did not suffer. 

 The Hilsa Fresh Fish Importers? Association has not been able to bring in the fish from Bangladesh since May 16, after the eastern animal quarantine and certification services stopped issuing no-objection certificates for the import. The certificate for livestock is issued only at seaports and airports.

 According to a gazette notification issued by the Union agriculture ministry in 2001, livestock imports must be accompanied by a sanitary import slip (SIP), to be issued by the department of animal husbandry and dairy.

 An official said the notification reached the Indo-Bangla border in December 2004, and the Customs then informed importers that permits for land imports could not be issued as the traders could produce neither the quarantine certification nor the SIP (the certificate leads to the issuance of the slip).

 Following the impasse, the chief minister had asked chief secretary Asok Gupta to take up the matter with the Centre. State fisheries secretary Rajpal Singh Kahlon had written to the Centre last week. Nanda, too, had taken up the matter with Union fisheries secretary P.M.A. Hakeem. 

 ?The Centre has no problem if the fish is imported routed through the air or sea route. But the traders insisted on land import, as the air route would lead to hilsa becoming dearer and import through the sea route could tell on the quality of the fish,? the official added.

 ?The Centre has requested us to create facilities at Petrapole for sanitation checks. The government will do its best to set up the infrastructure,? Nanda added.

 A 70-acre plot owned by the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) in Kalinagar, near Mahestala, is now a criminals? hideout. 

 The CMDA acquired the plot in 1964 to set up a string of projects, including a central dairy and a garment complex. But lack of funds and flawed planning have almost put paid to the project.Today, criminals make hay pilfering whatever infrastructure had been set up on the plot.

 ?We had planned a lot of projects on the 70-acre plot, on the southern fringes of the city. But unfortunately, criminals have virtually taken over the land,? a senior CMDA official said. He admitted that lack of funds and faulty planning stood in the way of implementing the projects.

 When contacted, CMDA chief executive officer P.R. Baviskar said he would shortly send a team of officials to inspect the land so that ?projects can be taken up afresh?.

 Officials said the agency has of late deployed private security guards to stop the pilferage of pump sets and electrical installations. 

 According to them, the land was acquired during the tenure of the late Bhola Sen as PWD minister and CMDA chairman. The government had then decided to set up a central dairy for housing khatals, that were sought to be relocated from Calcutta to curb pollution.

 ?Over a dozen cow-sheds, an administrative building and quarters for officials and veterinary surgeons were constructed at a cost of Rs 8 crore. Besides, pumping stations were installed and sewage lines laid,? recounted Kali Bhandari, chairman of the CPM-run Mahestala municipality.

 As for the proposed garments complex, Bhandari recalled that the foundation stone was laid in 1986 by then chief minister Jyoti Basu. 

 ?That did not materialise because of paucity of funds. Had the project been implemented, hundreds of jobless youths in the locality could have been engaged. We are still in the dark why the government is not utilising the precious land in the vicinity of Calcutta,? Bhandari added.

 In 2001, West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation and the state food processing department had mooted to set up units on the plot. ?Even that turned out to be a non-starter,? Bhandari rued.

 Development Employees? Joint Action Committee general secretary P.B. Nag has threatened a month-long agitation demanding proper utilisation of the land. ?We had submitted a proposal to CMDA two years ago for constructing a commercial housing project so the fund-starved body could make a profit. But the agency did not react,? he alleged.

 Flyover project a non-starter

 HIGH AND SLOW: Construction work at the Taratala

 Sattwik Talukder: A flyover is under construction in Taratala. We are facing several problems because of it. Do you think that once the flyover is completed, the problem of traffic congestion in the area will be solved?

 I don?t think that the flyover, once it is completed, will be able to solve the traffic congestion. The construction work is already 18 months behind schedule. I have spoken to PWD minister Amar Choudhury about the problems faced by the common people due to the delay. The minister assured me that the flyover will be completed by the Pujas.

 The construction work is regularly causing severe traffic snarls at the Taratala crossing. The traffic situation in the area has become so chaotic that even ambulances are finding it difficult to cross the stretch. If the flyover is not completed by the Pujas, pandal-hoppers in the area are in for a very tough time.

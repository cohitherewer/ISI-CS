The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 A number of Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) study centres are 

there in the city. Unfortunately, lectures at these centres usually commence after 

the scheduled date. As a result, the syllabi are completed perfunctorily and in 

haste. Moreover, the study material is not supplied to the students in time from 

Delhi. The coordinators at the study centres do not convey the students? anguish 

to the Delhi office. Many students in the city did not receive their admit cards 

in time for the examinations that were held from June 1. Some candidates had to 

come from far-off places like Purulia and Bankura to the IGNOU regional office 

at Bikash Bhavan, Salt Lake, to collect duplicate admit cards.

Counter point

 We do not have the class system, we only provide academic counselling through 

our study centres. Most of our approved counsellors are teachers attached to various 

prestigious local institutions. Hence, they sometimes miss theory sessions. But 

the practicals are conducted regularly. Often, the students take it for granted 

that in an open university system, everything will be spoon-fed to them. This 

mindset needs to be changed. The examination admit cards are sent from Delhi by 

post. Many students apply for the examination only by March-end. This delays the 

process of making and dispatching their admit cards. We have the provision of 

providing duplicate admit cards. This time we issued more than 400 duplicate admit 

cards, even till a day before the exams. In special cases, we even allow students 

to appear for the examinations as ?stray? candidates and get the paperwork done 

later. We are always there to try and help the students if they approach us with 

their problems. But they, too, need to take the courses under IGNOU more seriously.

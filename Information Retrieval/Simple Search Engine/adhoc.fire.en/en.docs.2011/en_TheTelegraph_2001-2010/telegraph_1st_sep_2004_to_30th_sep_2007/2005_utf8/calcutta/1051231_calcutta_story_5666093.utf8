 Melody magic beyond barriers

 He didn?t know he could sing till he got to college. Now, he is one of the most sought-after upcoming artistes in the Hindi film music industry. With hit numbers like O humdum suniyo re and Bheege honth tere, Kunal Ganjawala is on a roll. So is Vasundhara Das, known for Salaam namaste, Shakalaka baby and Karle salaame, as well as for Hey Ram and Monsoon Wedding.

 Abhisek Banerjee, alumnus of St Xavier?s College, caught up with the duo at Beyond Barriers, organised in association with The Telegraph, on the college grounds on December 23.

 How did you get a break in the music industry?

 Some of my seniors in Elphinstone College, Mumbai, ordered me to sing during a ragging session. That?s when I discovered that I could take up singing as a profession.

 After the commercial Doodh doodh doodh (which I sang for Leslie Lewis) became popular, I started getting regular work in jingles. But playback for movies and albums happened only because of the support of my wife, Gayatri, and friends.

 Who is your idol?

 Panchamda and SD Burman are my sources of inspiration. Also, I like lending my voice to Akshay Khanna.

 Any wise words for upcoming musicians and Calcuttans?

 Nothing comes easy in life. Each person who wants to taste success on his own terms has to struggle initially. But never compromise honesty, even if it delays success.

 lHow did you like Calcutta?

 It was just fantastic performing in front of a 12,000-plus crowd.

 lWhat genre of songs do you prefer to sing? 

 My choice of song doesn?t depend on genres. I opt for whatever I am comfortable singing, be it in English, Hindi or any regional language. But ballads are my favourites.

 What happened to Jam Tree and River, the music bands you had formed?

 Jam Tree was the result of an experiment with a group of musicians I came across when I was studying in Mount Carmel College, Bangalore. It was a hasty decision, and perhaps that?s the reason it didn?t even last a year. 

 River was a more serious attempt of compiling world music with contributions from musicians around the country. In the long run, River didn?t survive due to a lack of initiative from some of those musicians. However, I learnt a lot through the experiences.

 Your message to upcoming singers?

 There would be nothing to lose if you put in hard work, as there?s a lesson to be learnt through experience. The numerous musical talent hunts on television are good platforms.

 around town

 Gunjan Jawanda of Bhawanipur College was recently crowned Miss University at a beauty pageant organised by National Institute of Management, Mumbai. ldquo;I want to pursue higher studies so I declined an offer to take part in the Miss India contest, rdquo; said the second-year student of economics (hons).

 Christmas cheer

 nA grand Christmas carnival was hosted by Calcutta Foundation at Raj Bhavan on December 20 for children from NGOs Cini Asha, Future Hope, Udayan and others. Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi and the First Lady spent time with the children and watched a song-and-dance programme and a skit. Santa Claus distributed food and gifts to the kids, while Francis Lepcha?s songs made the occasion even more special. The programme wouldn?t have been a success without the volunteers from school interact clubs.

 For old time?s sake

 It was a journey down memory lane for the alumni of Ramakrishna Mission Residential College, Narendrapur, at the 18th edition of the biennial reunion. Each former student was gifted a copy of the ex-students? magazine, Arghya. In the post-lunch session, past and present students of the English department gathered in the Shakespeare Gallery for some adda. Bappaditya Banerjee of the 2004 batch sang John Denver?s Country Roads. Interesting anecdotes from college and hostel life added spice to the interaction. After a group photo session with teachers and students, it was time for the alumni to bid adieu to the sylvan campus once again.

 Fun amp; frolic

 Fun and gaiety marked the annual school fest of South Point juniors, Ullas, held on the campus in early December with participation from 800 students aged between six and 12 from 20 city schools . Spell Bee, Poster It, Chitrangan (rangoli), Mukhakriti, Rhyme amp; Rhythm, Math-O-Fun and Do-Re-Mi were the main events on the first day of the fest. On Day Two, the focus shifted to Madhusudan Mancha where Kwizwiz, Razzmatazz (skit) and Ghungroo were held. Later, the host school passed on the champion?s trophy to Delhi Public School.

 The Diary

 Sitting on the meadows of time,

 winds pass on, flowers wither,

 people move on and the green turns yellow.

 He stares with tears at the inattentive world,

 where dreams get scattered, light gets blown off,

 and where no one looks at him.

 He sits motionless, the dust covers him,

 the earth lays her healing hands on him.

 In this careless world, dreams could never sprout,

 yet a year after his burial, a flower sprung out....

 What does a wave think?

 Travelling fast, reaching high, and trying to soar;

 Foaming, rippling, denting the glassy world;

 Carrying both with it, shark and pearl;

 How does it feel when it knows that the end is so near;

 That there is no further from here;

 When it knows that no matter how high it reaches it will break at the shore;

 And then be lost in time, and exist no more;

 What does a wave think when it heads for the shore?

 Utsav Drolia, 

 La Martiniere for Boys

 Dawn aches, With scratches of night

 Visible in purple pricked eyes, And slashed lips.

 Daybreak rush rouges the face, To be displayed.

 Hold the hand to the heart, Till it?s simple again,

 Hold your heart to the flesh

 Till we touch peace in yours.

 Adwaita Das, 

 Jadavpur University

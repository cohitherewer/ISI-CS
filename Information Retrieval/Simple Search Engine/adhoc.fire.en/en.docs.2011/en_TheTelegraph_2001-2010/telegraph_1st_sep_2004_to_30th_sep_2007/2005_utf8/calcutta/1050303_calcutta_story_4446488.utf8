 Build bar on borders of Rajarhat 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Areas bordering New Town, Rajarhat, will soon be brought under the Town and Country Planning Act to put an end to unbridled construction there, the state government announced on Wednesday. 

 The matter was discussed at length in a review meeting of the Rajarhat township among chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, housing minister Gautam Deb and development and planning minister Nirupam Sen. 

 ?Some people might take advantage of the value-addition of the land surrounding Rajarhat because of the township?s growth. Naturally, something needs to be done to check unplanned growth and hence, the imposition of the Act is essential,? minister Deb said after the meeting.

 He added that the government has not yet decided how much land bordering Rajarhat would be brought within the restriction net.

 The areas on the north and western sides of the township ? towards the airport and Baguiati ? are under municipalities controlled by Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority.

 Both the places are congested, and there isn?t scope for much construction there. The southern side of the township is a wetland. 

 ?In effect, the regulations are essential for the eastern side, which is a village area with lots of open space,? minister Deb said.

 Once the eastern side of Rajarhat is brought under the Act, growth can be restricted and illegal constructions can be done away with. Builders in the area will have to follow provisions of the Act. 

 Deb said on Wednesday that plans for the Rajarhat township include development of a sports city, a health city, two IT cities, a central business district (which might involve shifting of several state government departments from Calcutta) and some consulate offices.

 ?We had the concept of a sports city for some time. The idea is to have stadiums, playgrounds and other facilities related to sports,? the housing minister said.

 Deb added that he was open to the idea of Steve Waugh or Saurav Ganguly getting involved in setting up sports facilities at Rajarhat.

 He also said that Rajarhat would have ample scope for entertainment ? ?perhaps a hall bigger than Nandan and places like Park Street?.

 ?If people can dance in Calcutta till late at night, we?ll make sure people can dance throughout the night at Rajarhat, too,? minister Dey signed off.

 New corner for sip ?n? bite

 Since May 24, 1887, when Lt-Gov. Sir Stewart Bailey launched the institution ceremoniously, Calcutta Swimming Club (then known as The Calcutta Swimming Baths) has come a long way.

 After a total overhaul of the regal Main Bar and commissioning of the new-look banquets on the first floor overlooking the pools on either side, the management of the Strand Road club has now put in place a brand new food court-cum-bar, in place of the earlier, somewhat shabby, counter.

 ?The old structure had outlived its utility and was decaying. So, we decided to redo it. It?s part of the layered renewal initiative at the club. We have changed the interior set-up completely, making it more user-friendly,? says club president Binod Khattry.

 Earlier, on a busy day, particularly during swimming season, the dining room and the poolside area used to be ?jam-packed?, and many members had to go without food. ?Now, more than 20 people can sit down and enjoy a bite,? the president adds.

 A food court in a club itself is a novelty, feels architect Sukanya Dasgupta, who has created the design solution. ?In my effort to capture the poolside ambience, I have extended the outdoor ruggedness to the food court-cum-bar, while not compromising on the desired gleam and the spirit of the club,? she explains.

 There?s a judicious blend of old and new, order and disorder, with the rigidity being deliberately broken by the informal flow of lines and colour. ?It?s like a new thing arising from the old, and one had to be conscious of the predominantly well-heeled profile of the club and its members,? says Dasgupta.

 The food court, slated to be unveiled this week, has two kitchens and will serve Indian, Mexican and Lebanese cuisine, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian.

 The ice-cream counter has been relocated and done up, while the bar has been redone too, with ?more accommodation and better stocks?.

 Earlier, the Swimming Club had commissioned senior architect Dulal Mukherjee to completely refurbish its Main Bar. Mukherjee used lighter panels, a plain painted surface and indirect illumination to ?lift the melancholic mood? at the bar which was previously burdened by an overdose of wooden panelling.

 ?The essential spirit at the food court-cum-bar attached to the outer pool is similar to the Main Bar ? modern, upmarket and lively. I could use vibrant colours like streaks of orange, while sandstone finish has been applied to exude the sense of ruggedness that was important to drive home,? explains Dasgupta.

 The food court and bar are most strategically located, observes past president Nandu Belani. ?We wanted a place, which would answer the needs of today?s generation and at the same time, uphold the exalted traditions of the institution.?

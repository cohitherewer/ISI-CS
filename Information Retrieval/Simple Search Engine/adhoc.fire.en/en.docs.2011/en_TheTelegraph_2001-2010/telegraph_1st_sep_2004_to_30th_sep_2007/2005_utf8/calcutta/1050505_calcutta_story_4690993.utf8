The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 JU investigator regrets role

 - My report did not endorse expulsion, says professor

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The investigator appointed by Jadavpur University to probe the September 2003 campus agitation has told Metro that he regrets having taken up the assignment because the students have started perceiving him as a villain.

 ?I wish I had not taken up the assignment. The students are now blaming me for everything that is happening on the campus,? said Prof Amit Sen, chairman of the one-man inquiry commission and member of the West Bengal Human Rights Commission.

 ?I do not belong to the university and have no role to play in the matter, and I am not to be blamed,? he asserted.

 ?The university authorities had appointed me to investigate the matter. I interviewed 23 people who responded to a notice and prepared the report. However, I did not recommend anything at all. It is entirely up to the university authorities to decide what action they will take,? Sen explained.

 He added: ?The report may be right or wrong. The executive council will have to decide.?

 Admitting that the report was ex-parte, the professor said that only two students had deposed before the commission after ?repeated notices?.

 ?Two notices were served asking students to stand witness, but Fetsu decided that we would not comply, since a one-man commission went against the democratic spirit, and had informed the authorities accordingly,? said Sudipta Sarkar, one of the five showcaused students. 

 In their reply to the registrar, the showcaused students pointed out that the depositions made by the two students were not treated like those made by the other witnesses. They were described as ?alleged accused?, which is a blatant indication of the authorities? bias, the Fetsu members said.

 Regarding the identity of the students who had ?physically manhandled? the controller of examinations on September 16, 2003, while he was boarding his car along with a lady professor of the philosophy department, Sen?s report noted a ?discrepancy between the statement made in the letter of complaint submitted to the vice-chancellor by P.K. Sengupta (controller of examinations) and his submission to the commission?.

 Sengupta mentioned in the complaint that he himself had decided to come out of the car as the situation might have spun out of control. In his deposition, he, however, stated that he, along with the philosophy professor, was forcibly brought out of the car and roughed up.

 The commission observed in its report that only one witness had corroborated Sengupta?s deposition. 

 On the other hand, as many as 11 witnesses had supported what he had said in the complaint.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A-1 raise in house rent demanded 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The Association of Secretariat Employees, a state government employees? organisation, has moved a petition in Calcutta High Court, demanding house rent allowance at the rate of 30 per cent of the basic pay for the Calcutta-based staff, as the city had been declared an A-1 city.

 A division bench of Justice A.K. Chakraborty and Justice S.P. Talukdar heard the case for the second consecutive day on Thursday and adjourned the verdict.

 Advocate Sadhan Roy Chowdhury, representing the association, told the court that state government employees residing in other A-1 cities are paid house rent at the rate of 30 per cent of their basic pay.

 ?On the basis of the Pay Commissions? recommendations in 1998, all state government employees get 15 per cent house rent,? he said.

 After Calcutta was declared an A-1 city by the Centre in 1997, the then chief minister had written to the Union government asking it to disburse 30 per cent house rent to its employees living in the city. ?But the state did not provide 30 per cent house rent to its own employees,? Roy Chowdhury argued.

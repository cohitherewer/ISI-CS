Eggs and bunny bites

The Easter spread of sweet delights at 

the new-look Flurys promises to pamper. Smita Roy Chowdhury finds out just

As we get set to paint the town in the colours of 

Holi, it?s also time to gear up for Easter. Flurys, true to its reputation of 

being an English-style tearoom, is among the first eateries in town to unveil 

an entire range of Easter goodies. And the affair, according to executive chef 

of The Park, Shaun Kenworthy, promises to be unique.

?This is the first time we are celebrating Easter 

at Flurys in such a big way and the goodies and d?cor will be quite special. I 

think most people in this part of the country haven?t ever seen something like 

this before,? claims Kenworthy.

Huge chocolate sculptures and carvings of Easter eggs 

and bunnies are being put up as part of the Park Street store d?cor, while smaller 

variations of the same will fill up the festive platter.

Chocolate is the mainstay of all Easter goodies and 

the new-look Flurys has used its regular variety to whip up the delicacies. Other 

ingredients like bread dough, salt paste and pastilage figure in the d?cor as 

well.

Special ingredients and dollops of creativity create 

the festive fare, but what makes them really special are nuggets of nostalgia 

blended in by Kenworthy. ?I have a lot of childhood memories of Easter. It?s big 

celebration time in the UK when people wear new clothes and gift each other goodies. 

The occasion reminds me of those days ? chocolate bunnies, marshmallow chicks 

and Easter eggs,? he recalls.

The team of chefs at Flurys, under the guidance of 

Kenworthy, has rustled up a wide selection of traditional Easter favourites alongside 

some innovations. Even some old staples like the Hot Cross Bun and Chocolate Eggs 

have been worked upon to impart new flavours to them. A lot of variations of an 

egg, that spells Easter, have also been introduced.

Says Kenworthy: ?Like all spring festivals, Easter 

also ushers in a new season and hence it is associated with prosperity. The egg 

signifies a new beginning and so is the main symbol of Easter.?

The Flurys fare includes Hot Cross Buns, Simnel Cake, 

Solid Chocolate Eggs, Easter Bunny, Nest with Solid Chocolate Eggs and Easter 

Bunnies, Nougatine Egg, Hollow Chocolate Rabbit filled with chocolates, Hollow 

Chick and Bunny Egg, Cup Cakes with Mini Eggs and Easter Bonnet Cake.

Other gift grabs include Easter Basket (two chocolate 

bunnies, one simnel cake and six hot cross buns), Kids? Basket (one chocolate 

chick and bunny chocolate egg and one teddy bear) and Mini Rabbits in packs of 

nine pieces.

Most of the goodies are aimed at kids, who, feels 

Kenworthy, form the main clientele during this festival. ?The cute little eggs, 

bunnies and rabbits attract kids a lot, as do the interesting large displays,? 

he says. ?We?re looking forward to the response. There is a considerable Christian 

community in Calcutta. That apart, the attractive look of the stuff is expected 

to draw people from other communities, too. Though we are not expecting the demand 

to be anything like Christmas or New Year, it should be more than Valentine?s 

Day,? predicts the chef.

The spread, already available at the store, will be 

on offer till March 27.

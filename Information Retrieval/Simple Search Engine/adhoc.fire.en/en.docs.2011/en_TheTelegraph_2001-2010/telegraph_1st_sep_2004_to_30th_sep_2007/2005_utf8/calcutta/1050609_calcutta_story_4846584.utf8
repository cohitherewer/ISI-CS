 Delight in discord

 Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie in Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith

 It?s the chemistry that everyone?s been talking about. And while the Brad Pitt-Angelina Jolie chemistry as a married couple worked on screen, rumour has it that it was the cause of the split of Pitt?s marriage to Jennifer Anniston. The screen pair might deny any hanky panky behind the scenes, but Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith (which releases on June 10) is proof that the two make the perfect pair.

 ?Brad and Angie are, in all fairness, the reason this movie works, entirely. Their chemistry is spectacular,? says Akiva Goldsman, a producer of the film. ?You could tell instantly that they each thought the other was funny and sort of odd and they?re very different people. Whether or not they?re different in the ways Mr and Mrs Smith are, I can?t say, but they?re sufficiently different to be tremendously amused by each other and that seemed to us the beginning of a good marriage.?

 The film is about a modern relationship ? on the rocks from years of ignoring it. ?John and Jane have been married for five or six years when the film begins and that?s one of the disputes, one of the small disputes between the couple,? explains director Doug Liman. 

 ?Five or six years of lies have taken there toll on the marriage and it is a dead marriage. In this case, their lies are about the fact that they?ve been secretly killing people when the other one thinks they?re just going to work. But that?s a very honest phenomenon and that?s a very thing that happens to marriages, to any relationship, if it?s based on lies. Eventually that?s sort of like a virus that?s going to effect the whole relationship and so their relationship is pretty much dead,? he adds.

 But despite the cool stunts ? both actors did a lot of their own stunts, including Jolie?s jump across a building ? and the snazzy special effects, it?s still about two people in a bad relationship, says the mother of two. ?The whole story is a very interesting way of discussing marriage and dealing with marriage.?

 It might be an exciting adventure, but there?s still a great heart to it at the end. ?As a character, it?s a balance. You can accomplish so much and you can do anything in your professional job which I think most of us have. We?re so tough, we?re so clear and we?re faced with the relationship and we don?t know what to do. We don?t know how, and that these people would be some of the hardest, scariest, toughest people, and when it comes to love and emotions, they don?t know what to do,? adds Jolie.

 But it?s the action that?s sure to reel in the audiences. And, of course, the chemistry. Evident in the last dance scene. ?The Tango is a great dance. We love that dance and it?s two people trying to frisk each other and kill each other and question each other during the dance, so it?s very, between cracking my head against the wall and breaking my wrist, it?s romantic in a very weird way,? says the leading lady.

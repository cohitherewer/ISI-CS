Life

 Bachelors den

 HOUSE PROUD 

 If you rsquo;re single and love being on your own, Riddhima Seal tells you how 

 to deck up your private space

 Be what you want to be is your jingle. You live life by your rules. Your space is what you guard most fiercely. You love being on your own. Youre cool? If any of these define you, then a bachelors pad is what you owe yourself ? if you havent gifted yourself one already!

 Pick the place

 Choosing the address to create your space is most vital, before you start thinking of doing it up. For that, first figure out the budget. If money is not a constraint and you believe in living in style, then a large studio apartment would do just fine.

 Or else, go in for a barsati kind of an arrangement with a small terrace, as that easily renders a more personal touch.

 Wall smart

 Talk about walls and colours are what come to mind immediately. And the hues would differ dramatically for him and her. Guys could generally opt for manly shades like red, burgundy, violet and dark blue on the walls, especially if it is a studio apartment and the place is big. Girls, on the other hand, could go in for softer colours like light blues, pale greens and a lot of yellows. A very innovative way of doing up the walls for both is to use a lot of whites with patches of red, says interior designer Manjari Sahay. 

 Besides, one could use a variety of adornments like masks and paintings to dress em up.

 Floor it right

 For interior designer Anita Mansatta, the ground beneath your feet needs maximum attention in a bachelors pad, as everything is generally low-lying. 

 Wooden flooring works best as it is hip and classy at the same time. The other option could be to maintain bright vitrified tiles against a contrast of pale colours on the walls. And then there is always the marble flooring that tends to go best with the 40-plus who havent lost their zest for life. Whatever the choice, make sure it has in mind what you intend filling your rooms with.

 Let there be light

 Loads of hanging coloured lamps in papier mache, handmade paper and the like could do wonders to your place. You could also use stand lamps available in a variety of styles. 

 Keep the light-and-shade factor in mind while fixing the lights. Turn it up in the hangout areas, keep it low in your private corners. A lot of floating aromatic candles, particularly if its a single womans accommodation, can be used for a touch of elegance.

 Curtain call

 Although there is not much scope for curtains in a bachelors pad, thick heavy curtains for guys in either satin or cotton and embroidered lacy ones in earthy tones for the girls, going with the walls and the furniture of the room, would be good, feels Anita.

 D?cor dos

 If its a studio apartment, carefully allot a specific purpose for each zone.

 Seating

 Choose the side of the room that either has windows or a little balcony as your drawing room. Just lay out a mattress, some bean bags, loads of cushions in various shades, some durries and rugs to give it a comfy look. 

 Guys would probably prefer more of leather stuff than girls, as it is more macho. Girls could add some low-height Gujarati tools to bring in that ethnic look. A lot of flowers, both dry and fresh, could also give the room a tender touch, says Anita.

 Bedroom

 That corner where you could have a little bit of privacy. Put up a little divan, a very thick mattress or alternatively a sofa-cum-bed that could come to good use when there are friends lounging around. Put up a wall wardrobe in dark brown and a sleek dressing unit.

 Kitchen

 For your culinary requirements, allot a relatively larger space and separate it from the rest of the room with a glass partition. But do keep your kitchen simple. Just have a gas, a chimney, a microwave, a water purifier and lots of cupboards and drawers. To add a touch of glamour, have some modern art done on the glass partition, chorus Manjari and Anita.

 Others

 Every bachelor likes to have a small me corner. This could have the computer and books, with table, chair and a cabinet on the wall, says Manjari.

 And to make your little world all the more exciting for your friends, find room to have a bar counter done in wood. And if its in a slightly bigger space, regular bashes could be hosted here, says Anita.

 This is playing it by a few books. But if you want to do something else, feel free ? its your place, remember!

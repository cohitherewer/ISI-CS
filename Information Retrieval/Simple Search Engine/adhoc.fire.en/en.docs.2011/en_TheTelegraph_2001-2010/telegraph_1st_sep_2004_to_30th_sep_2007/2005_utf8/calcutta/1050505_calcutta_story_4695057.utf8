 Apur Sansar 2005. In a real-life replay of Satyajit Ray?s 1959 classic, Dipankar Bhaduri, administrative assistant with the Life Insurance Corporation of India, came to the rescue of a bride in distress after the groom and his parents went ?missing?.

 If Bhaduri, son of an ex-serviceman and a resident of Baguiati, reprised the role of Apu (Soumitra Chatterjee), the daughter of a retired General Electric Company employee was Aparna (Sharmila Tagore), a bride rescued from the brink at Narkeldanga.

 The groom and his family did not turn up for the Saturday night wedding and their house on Rashbehari Avenue was found under lock and key. The girl?s father returned home disconsolate late into the night, without the bridegroom, against whom a general diary was lodged with Gariahat police station.

 In desperation, Raja Goswami, one of the guests at the wedding that wasn?t, called up his sister and her husband at Baguiati, requesting them for their son?s hand for the distraught girl. ?When Raja telephoned me around midnight, we woke up our son. At first, he thought it was a joke, but then realising the situation, he immediately agreed to tie the knot. We left for the marriage venue along with one of my son?s friends at around 1 am,? said Dipankar?s mother, Karabi. The marriage was conducted in a hurry in the presence of a few guests who had lingered.

 ?I did what I thought was proper for me under the circumstances. For me, it was a negotiated marriage and I can only appreciate the quick decision my parents took,? said Dipankar, playing down his do-gooder role.

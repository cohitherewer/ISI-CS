 The 14 Fame Gurukul contestants: Bound by music

 Here?s news for those who can?t get enough of Fame Gurukul. Tune in to MTV right after the show for the triumph and the tears of the contestants on the Sony mega show. The result of a production and content tie-up between the two channels, Fame Gurukul MTV is on from July 18, Monday to Thursday at 9 pm, and every Friday at 9.30 pm, on MTV. 

 VJ Sophie will interview the contestants in 15 and 30-minute capsules. The show, to be aired for 12 weeks, will reveal juicy titbits, rivalries, candid confessions and unseen footage from the main show. 

 Says Vikram Raizada, vice-president, marketing and interactive, MTV Networks India: ?The M in MTV stands for music so it?s only expected that we would be associated with a music show like Fame Gurukul. The way we have associated though is innovative. Viewers will be able to see unique insights on MTV. It?s all about us coming together to multiply reach and audiences.? 

 If all that?s not enough, MTV will air build-up programming covering the Making of Fame Gurukul, meeting the faculty, jury, contestants and much more. MTV will also hold special contests, which will entitle viewers to win a chance to be part of the studio audience, hang out with the winners and win goodies. 

 Speaking on the association, Anupama Mandloi, creative director, Sony Entertainment Television, said: ?When I think of youth, I think of MTV; hence we are delighted about this innovative partnership.?

 Code for spinal trauma treatment

 SUBHRO SAHA

 ?We should, we must, we can.? Words of the late Christopher Reeve, who fired the imagination of the world more by his battle against spinal trauma and paralysis than his Superman heroics.

 Now, the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation set up to fight spinal injuries has a corpus of $20 billion and counting.

 The Hollywood star did his bit and more to combat the dreaded consequences of spinal injuries before he succumbed to heart failure. 

 Now, a clutch of city doctors has moved to formulate a set of uniform guidelines for the management and treatment of spinal trauma and upgrade knowledge and skills of primary physicians.

 ?In India, there?s hardly any guideline for any disease. This results in lack of standardisation and quality control,? says neurosurgeon Amitabha Chanda. 

 He, along with a group of 14 other specialist doctors in the city, recently organised a symposium to establish uniform guidelines for the management and treatment of spinal cord injuries.

 Chanda laments that this ?devastating condition? is affecting a large number of people, the majority among them young adults in the prime of their productive lives. ?Early and appropriate treatment may often change the scenario. The guidelines can update primary-care physicians on management and transport of these patients before they arrive at tertiary-care hospitals,? says Chanda.

 With these objectives, the symposium discussed various aspects of spinal injuries. The speakers presented guidelines suited to the Indian perspective, which were followed by discussion and the inputs were recorded.

 Among the topics discussed at the symposium were: how the patient should be transported, essential radiological investigations, reduction of the fracture/dislocation by manipulation, pharmacological treatment, management of different types of spinal injuries, like cervical, dorsal and lumbar, and paediatric spinal injuries.

 The next point of action for the core medical group is to collate information from the presentations and edit the topics to reach a consensus. Once a consensus is reached, the guidelines will be presented at the National Neuro-trauma Conference, to be held in the city this August.

 After the guidelines are approved at the national level, booklets will be distributed among the primary doctors, who are the first points of contact for the patients. The core group also realises the need to create a resource pool of trained paramedics.

 ?We are optimistic that the guidelines can make a difference. However, we have to be realistic as well, and not expect magical results overnight, considering the number of trauma cases we are talking about,? cautions Harsh Jain, consultant neurosurgeon, Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals.

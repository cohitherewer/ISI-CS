 Fahrenheit fight for our furry friends

 PET PASSION 

 NILANJANAA 

 If you don?t want a hot dog or you want to keep your cat cool, pet owners should be alert to the dangers of summer. Here are some tips to keep your furry friends safe this summer:

 Heat stroke and first-aid: The rise in the temperature of the body beyond normal levels is called a heat stroke. It is caused by the hot, humid weather, inadequate ventilation and exposure to direct sunlight. Never leave your pet unattended in closed space like cars. Even with the windows open, the temperature can rise to 120?F within minutes, causing a heat stroke, which may also prove fatal.

 Continuous panting and profuse salivation are the signs, along with anxious expression, warm-dry skin, high fever, rapid heartbeat, red gums and eyes, vomiting.

 Seek medical treatment immediately. Meanwhile, move your dog to a cool well-ventilated area, give it cool water with glucose/lime juice, a pinch of salt and a teaspoon of sugar. Once it can chew, let it lick ice cubes. 

 Lower your pet?s body temperature 

 by placing ice packs or towels around the head and neck 

 region or by immersing in cool water.

 Pests and prevention: Ticks, 

 fleas, mange, viral and bacterial diseases are on the rise 

 during summer. The irritation caused by ticks and fleas 

 cause them to itch and thereby damage their coat. This damages 

 the skin, making it prone to bacterial infections called 

 Pyoderma. Ticks also transmit a blood parasite that causes 

 Tick Fever ? a potentially fatal condition. Mange caused 

 by microscopic skin parasites called mites can also be got 

 when a diseased pet comes in contact with a healthy animal.

 Most of these diseases are easily prevented with basic hygiene, regular check-ups and routine vaccinations. Only use flea and tick treatments recommended by your vet. Never use preventive products specifically for dogs on your cat. Getting rid of ticks and fleas from your pet?s body is a short-term treatment. Follow it up by vacuuming your house and washing all bedding thoroughly.

 Exercise etiquette: It is best not to keep your pet in the sun between 10 am and 4 pm. On very hot days, limit exercise to early morning or evening hours when it?s cooler and walk your pet at a gentle pace. Asphalt gets very hot and can burn your pet?s paws so go for the grass. Carry water.

 Water and diet: Whether indoors or out, your pet needs access to lots of fresh water, so check the water bowl several times a day. The most common complaint of pet owners in summers is that their pets are ?off food?. 

 This is not a cause of worry as long as the animals are active and alert. Try and feed them during the cooler hours of the day.

 Litterbox: For cat owners, maintaining a clean litter-box is especially important during hot and humid summer months, when household odours can be extremely troublesome. Add crushed pieces of charcoal to combat the odour.

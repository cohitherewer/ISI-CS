 Phone-tap route to trap couple killer

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Mired in a mesh of unanswered questions in the couple killing case, police are now pinning their hopes on two cell phones the prime suspect has been using ever since he stepped out of Mansarovar building, on Camac Street, early on Monday.

 All calls from these two sets are being monitored by a team presently camping in Jharkhand, sources said.

 The move comes after sleuths realised the assailant ? who introduced himself as Pancham while entering the Banka home as a domestic help ? had stolen two cell phones belonging to the couple. A large amount of jewellery and cash was also looted after the murder.

 Officially, police were not willing to comment on the phone-tapping. With the detective department taking over investigation from the Shakespeare Sarani police station on Wednesday, mum was the word.

 Even city detective chief Gyanwant Singh remained evasive: ?Our efforts are on to hunt him out, based on certain leads. There are several loose ends in this case and a true picture will emerge only after he has been arrested.?

 The one thing puzzling the police is why the suspect had left so many loose ends while carrying out the crime like a pro.

 Sources said the man who called himself Pancham knew the daily routine of the Banka couple so well that he knew exactly when to time the assault.

 A portrait of Pancham, last seen leaving Mansarovar at around 7.30 am on Monday, has been drawn, based on various inputs. But there is some confusion about the portion around the nose.

 ?Even the portrait is not perfect and this is posing problems in tracking him down,? admitted an officer.

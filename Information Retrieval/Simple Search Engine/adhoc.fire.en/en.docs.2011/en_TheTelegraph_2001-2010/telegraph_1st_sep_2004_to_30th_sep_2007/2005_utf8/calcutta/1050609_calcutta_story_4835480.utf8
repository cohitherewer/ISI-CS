 Comfort, convenience and the lived-in look are the accents of four mens wear lines unveiled in the city recently. Look around the standalone outlets and multi-brand stores and choose a look that suits you:

 Smooth amp; suave: 

 Rushed for time doesnt necessarily mean wrinkled. If you hate getting up every morning and ironing your trousers, switch over to Dockers Never Iron Pants.

 This is the newest range of trousers launched simultaneously in India and the US. Made from cotton, they promise to let you look and feel cool at all times.

 The finish of the fabric gives the trousers a straight-from-the-dry-cleaner-look, right down to a permanent crease, priced at Rs 2,199.

 Retro chic: 

 Wrangler has launched its spring summer 2005 collection, taking in a range of denims, cargoes, shirts and tees.

 The aged effect in grey and black, brick-red reverse herringbone and slaughtered wash are a few of the looks being offered by this global casual wear major.

 Retro is really in for its in-your-face styling. All the major brands are launching their retro collections and they are moving really fast, explains Deepak Mirani, manager, retail operations, Shoppers Stop, City Centre.

 A range of shirts is to be had in a variety of fabrics like yarn-dyed stripes and textured cottons with embellishments like embroidery, printing and tinting. Lowers start at Rs 1,195, while shirts begin at Rs 795.

 Sporty class: 

 Arrow Sport, the sportswear brand from the mens wear label Arrow, has launched its linen collection for summer. 

 Now, the emphasis is on yarn-dyed stripes and checks, in acid green, pink, blues, lilacs, red, olive, purple and peach.

 These shirts have been made of friendly fabrics keeping in mind the extreme climatic condition at this time of year. The linen absorbs moisture from the body to ensure comfort and yet maintain individual style, says Janak Dave, business head, Arrow.

 The shirts are priced at Rs 1,495. A new range of linen trousers has also been launched at Rs 1,795. 

 Premium punch: 

 Manzoni, Raymonds luxury lifestyle brand, has unveiled its spring-summer 2005 collection at the Poddar Court showroom Raymond store on Saturday.

 Manzoni is famous for its high quality and international styling. This season it has also introduced a line of shoes, belts, silk ties and cotton socks, says Sidharth Pansari, director, Pansari Group of Enterprises.

 Jackets are a blend of either wool-silk or linen, while shirts are in cotton and linen. Manzoni bottom wear is fashioned from top-of-the-line wool or wool blends and is available in colours of blue, black, beige and brown.

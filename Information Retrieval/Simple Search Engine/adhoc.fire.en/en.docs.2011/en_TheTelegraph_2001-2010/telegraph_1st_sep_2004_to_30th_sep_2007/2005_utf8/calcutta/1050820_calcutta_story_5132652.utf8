 Tangerine, the multi-cuisine eatery on Outram Street, is ringing in the Parsi New Year with a lavish feast this weekend. Called Navroz, the festival is on at the restaurant till Sunday.

 The richness of Parsi food is rarely explored on a large scale. The secrets of their cuisine are well-kept by Parsi families. This year we managed to get some authentic recipes and so we decided to roll out the spread for our diners, says chef Sujit Sinha of Tangerine. 

 The buffet, priced at Rs 250, boasts a wide selection of vegetarian and non-vegetarian delicacies. The soup section allows you to take your pick from a light Corn Coriander Chicken Soup or a more filling Kidney Bean Tomato Soup. 

 While other non-Parsi dishes do feature on the buffet, the emphasis is on Mutton Dhansak (a mixture of meat and lentils cooked in traditional Parsi style), Salli Murghi (a Parsi chicken favourite), Baked Fish Parsi Style and Chicken Cutlet for non-vegetarians. 

 Veggies can opt for Titori (sprouted lentil-based vegetable gravy), Pakora Kadhi and Brown Onion Pulao.

 Parsi food is very nutritious and ideal for those who prefer light and healthy food, adds Sinha.

 To end the meal on a sweet note, there are Malpoa, Parsi Seviyan and Caramel Custard, to name a few.

 Pasta platter

 Italian flavours are the order of the season at La Terrasse, the multi-cuisine restaurant at The Oberoi Grand. On till the end of the month, an Italian Fiesta tempts diners into trying out the authentic taste of pastas.

 Coming in a variety of shapes and sizes and complementing cheesy and tomato-based sauces, the pastas are a must-try at the restaurant.

 Spaghetti Rustici (rustic-styled spaghetti with sun-dried tomato, red wine, chilli flakes and tomato), Fettuccini Con Gi Asparagi (pasta tossed with asparagus, lime and cream) and Fusilli Pinolati (pasta with pine nuts, roasted bell peppers, garlic, spinach and Parmesan cheese) are recommended for veggies.

 Non-vegetarians can take their pick from a vast selection of poultry, meat and fish items. Fettucini Alla Carbonara (fettucini with pancetta bits, egg, cream, Parmesan cheese and black pepper) is an all-time favourite, while Fusilli Ai Frutti Di Mare (pasta twists tossed with shrimps, mussels, squid, bekti and tomato) is great for seafood lovers. Others can go for the Capellini Del Pollaiolo (pasta with grilled chicken, celery, onion and tomato) or Farfalle Alla Maiella Con Salsa Allo Zafferano (lamb strips with chilli flakes and saffron). Each dish is accompanied by garlic bread.

 The festival allows us to experiment with varieties of pastas not explored previously in our menu, says executive chef George K. George. 

 The pastas are priced between Rs 450 and Rs 475.

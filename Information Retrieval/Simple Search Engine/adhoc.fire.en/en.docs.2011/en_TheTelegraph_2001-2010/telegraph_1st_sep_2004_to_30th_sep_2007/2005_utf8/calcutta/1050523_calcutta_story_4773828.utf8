 For the child at heart

 - Seduction of lines and colour 

 SOUMITRA DAS

 Pegasus in a series on Mythological Creatures executed by Sara Fanelli in 2002 

 Every Bengali adult, in all likelihood, remembers till the end of his or her days, the thrill of first opening his or her copy of Thakurmaar Jhuli and stumbling upon she-demons with huge salivating tongues, bristly ogres or khokkoses who resembled badgers in undies, and the blind prince wielding a sword as he threatened to decapitate the Hydra-headed snake emerging from the sleeping princess? nostrils. 

 It was the magic of those engravings so rooted in reality yet, on the flimsiest pretext, slipping into the world beyond the pale of reason, that was guaranteed to hold any child spellbound.

 Thus, it was with a sense of anticipation and awe that one approached the British Council exhibition of contemporary illustrations of children?s books by artists who are still alive, that is now on at the Seagull Media Arts and Resource Centre. This is perhaps the first time that such an array of original drawings and paintings meant for such books is being put on display. It is possible to see every picture as the artist originally intended, down to the lightest traces of lead or striae of nibs. The show is curated by Quentin Blake, known for his Punch cartoons and his pictures for Roald Dahl classics. 

 Like the best of children?s books and art work, the appeal of this exhibition extends beyond the tastes of under-age viewers to whom it is addressed. Not only do the artists employ every technique ? the computer does not daunt them ? in the trade, they do it with an amazing flair and innovativeness, even borrowing ideas from modernist masters. Yet such is the mastery with which they draw, that with the merest flick of a pen or pencil they can represent a mood, a concept or a state of mind. As a result, they unlock the wellsprings of imagination that the waking world does its best to shackle.

 Many of the exhibits will perhaps be appreciated more by adults. Posy Simmonds? black-and-white illustrations of a party are quite worldly and their sophistication will be of greater interest to grown-ups. The artists don?t stop short of the kitchen sink reality and the potentially horrific. Michael Foreman conjures up snowy battlefields and Raymond Briggs takes us back to war-torn London, dipping into their childhood memories for reference. 

 The artists ? 13 in all, including Blake ? either are 1930-born or are from the 1950s and the 1960s. Lauren Child juggles drawings, images, typography with tremendous zest on the computer screen. Sara Fanelli creates complex collages and photograms, even sprinkling foodstuff for texture. Stephen Biesty takes cross-sectional drawing to its logical end depicting not only how we are fleshed out but wired inside as well. A treat for the child at heart.

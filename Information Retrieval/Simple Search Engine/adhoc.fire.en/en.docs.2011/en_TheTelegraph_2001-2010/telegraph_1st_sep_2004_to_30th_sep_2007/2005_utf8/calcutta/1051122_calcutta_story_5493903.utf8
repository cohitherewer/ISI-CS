The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Here, there?s no room for gloom

 - WHEELCHAIR BRAVEHEARTS

 TRUE GRIT: Students of the Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy. A Telegraph picture

 ?I don?t like depending on people,? he asserts, his face contorting, both hands flailing in the air as he tries to fight his handicap. It?s not just speech that comes with difficulty to Promothesh Pal; he can?t write, either. 

 Yet, this victim of cerebral palsy is preparing for his Class XII exams and is determined to stand on his feet and contribute to society.

 Promothesh has had a hard time travelling alone from Andul, changing buses and the launch across the Hooghly, just to be at the weeklong 31st founder?s day exhibition of the Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy at Taratala.

 There are many other students like him in the large exhibition hall. Most of them confined to wheelchairs and a few, like Putul and Madhuri Kapoor (Mithu), totally unable to speak. 

 But not one of them is sitting idle or depressed. While Putul greets you using the Kathamala device developed by IIT, Mithu tells you she?s a computer programmer and has successfully handled various corporate assignments using a prod attached to her head to operate the specially-designed keyboard.

 ?They don?t need our pity, they need basic human rights,? says Subhra Chatterjee of IICP. Swati Chakraborty, coordinator ICT (the IT wing of the institute) rues that though IICP, in collaboration with IIT (Kharagpur), Jadavpur University and other bodies, was developing special software, there exist few links with manufacturing units. There is also no integration between the R amp;D teams in different parts of the country. ?What we need is a consortium and an assistive technology laboratory,? she adds.

 IICP has just launched its website, wwwiicpindia.com, that will not only give information on the NGO, welcome sponsors and sell greeting cards, but also provide general information on various augmentative and alternative facilities and treatments.

 The effects of cerebral palsy vary from slight defects to disabilities that make every act a struggle. Yet, nowhere on campus is there space for gloom. The rooms are decorated with bright graphic displays on Calcutta past and present, or the typical Calcutta mela. Everywhere are smiling children, everywhere is the unmistakable feeling of trust and love.

 Later, members of the IICP adult advocacy group Ankur stage a skit and a puppet show. Wheelchair-bound students speak the lines of hand puppets to underline their difficulties of access in public places. Forum, on Elgin Road, they say is a good place to catch a movie, buy things and hang about, because there are lifts to carry them quickly to whichever floor they wish.

 Forum, incidentally, is the venue for the launch of an awareness and fund-raising campaign Chalti Ka Naam Wheelchair on November 18. Four donation boxes will from now be kept in different parts of the mall and the effort may spread to City Centre, Hiland Park and Swabhumi in the coming weeks. ?The movement will not only generate finance for education, therapy and training but also, we hope, make the public more conscious,? says Chatterjee.

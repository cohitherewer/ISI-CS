 Candles, colours amp; cards for dhamaka

Go traditional with the look and feel of 

your D-day do. Shradha Agarwal tells you how

 Lots of light and loads of action? After all, its that time of the year. The time to take out the old Benarasis, to drape both yourself and then touch up the home furnishings. Also the time to host or attend a Diwali do ? that sole party of the year that doesnt really need a dress code, the name itself dictating all the rules. GoodLife gives you a step-by-step guide to host a dhamaka party:

Den decor

 Forget the minimalist look for once and go all out. The festival of lights is truly all about a play of light and colour and, in this case, less is surely not more.

 Colours can be introduced in many forms, be it the delicate touch of some petals or the vibrancy of rangoli hues. The d?cor should essentially be traditional, so swap the spiral candles with diyas or better still, try a diya and rangoli melange.

Use your old jamewars as throws 

on the sofas, display traditional lamps and replace all your funky crystal pieces 

with antique silverware, offers interior designer Ajay Arya. He also recommends 

floating diyas and marigold petals in a large urn filled with water.

Dress code

 Its very easy to get carried away by the festive feel, but you should avoid going over-the-top with trinkets, layers and gheras. Remember that you have to participate in the cracker fiesta at the Diwali bash. 

 so, a taash party calls for long seated hours (often at ground level), so comfort should be top priority. 

 Diwali is all about the sari with a top-heavy look and, that too, for purely functional reasons. Keeping the hem of the sari light helps drapability and also facilitates easy movement. Balance the look with an ornate blouse, an interesting headgear, a tika and stone earrings, suggests designer Sunipa Samadder.

 For men, its time to give up the boring stripes and take on a traditional avatar, maybe an ethnic kurta with a salwar.

 Salwars are preferred over fitted churidars and they also complement footwear, be it smart closed shoes or mojris, says Sunipa. 

A word of caution: avoid synthetics for this festival 

and stick to pure versions of silks and textured cottons.

Play corner

 The focal point of a traditional Diwali party is the taash zone, the hub of all activity. Setting up this corner is simple ? a few packs of cards and some game counters.

 Tried and tested, mattresses are the best bet. Cover them with plain white sheets, advises Arya. Loads of cushions and bolsters, all in ethnic garb, add a royal finishing touch.

Also, try to involve as many non-players as possible 

since your cards corner neednt be restricted to only cards. Keep a selection 

of other board games and watch the level of participation shoot up. Safest bets 

are good ol Pictionary, Monopoly and Business? 

Bites and sips

 Dont make the mistake of concentrating on snacky finger food alone, says restaurateur Naveen Pai. There should be two or three types of fill-them-up fare like bite-sized stuffed parathas.

 The Diwali menu should comprise an ideal mix of hot and cold food so that the hostess isnt stuck in the kitchen perpetually. It should also be non-messy, non-greasy and visually appealing, says Naveen. 

 With the party running into early morning, food should be long-lasting as well, not to forget an array of refreshing drinks.

 Citrus-based coolers and mint drinks are always welcome, but the bar should also be well-stocked. A perfect finishing touch is a good cup of coffee, adds Naveen.

Finally, dont forget to arrange trays full of 

traditional mithai. Any Diwali do is incomplete without these. Right from 

the traditional Kaju Barfi, Badam Halwa and Motipak to the more innovative chocolate 

diyas, guests should have their fill of sweet treats.

Mood music 

 This is one zone that is very age-group specific and so arises the great choice barrier. The youngsters will settle for lounge tracks like Just Be by DJ Tiesto or Dark Age by Medieval Punditz, but as the mood picks up they will switch to regular house mixes. The older age-group is more likely to settle for old numbers, offers DJ Girish.

Great choices would be RD Burman remixes, ghazals 

and, for a laugh, recorded CDs of the Great Indian Laughter Challenge, 

what Girish refers to as the new haasya kavi sammelan.

Just like that 

 Personal touches earn more brownie (barfi in this case) points than anything else. They should be simple, yet effective, and at the same time ensure long-lasting memories, both for your guests and you.

 Make some simple invites and send them over with a set of candles, a day before the party. Also arrange for some silent crackers, like anaar or mashaals that do wonders for the ambience. Diffuse or spray aromatic essential oils, but choose pleasing smells with a traditional undertone to suit the festive breeze.

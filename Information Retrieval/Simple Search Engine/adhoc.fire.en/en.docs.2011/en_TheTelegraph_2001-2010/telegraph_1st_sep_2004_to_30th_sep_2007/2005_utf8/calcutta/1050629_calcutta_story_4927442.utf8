 Sommersby (1993)

 Director Jon Amiel

 Cast Richard Gere, Jodie Foster, Bill Pullman

 Plot Jack Sommersby (Gere), believed to have been killed in the war, returns to his wife Laurel (Foster) one fine day. It appears that Jack has changed a lot, leading some to believe that he is an imposter. Laurel herself is unsure, but willing to take the man into her home, and later into her heart...

 It was based on the French film, The Return of Martin Guerre, starring G?rard Depardieu, which itself was based on a famous court case.

 For her role in the film, Foster had to learn how to handle a horse-pulled buckboard.

 There is a cow in the film who is called Clarice, which is the name of Foster?s Oscar-winning character in The Silence of the Lambs.

 Amiel placed the film in post-Civil War Tennessee, and largely shot Sommersby at several locations in Virginia like Appomattox, Farmville, Hot Springs and Lexington.

 Composer Danny Elfman, best known for his Batman score, gave the background music.

 Paheli (2005)

 Director Amol Palekar

 Cast Shah Rukh Khan, Rani Mukherjee, Amitabh Bachchan

 Plot Lachchi (Rani) is distraught when husband Kishen (Shah Rukh) leaves her the morning after their wedding. Enter, a lovestruck spirit (Shah Rukh) to take his place. When the real Kishen returns, the woman has to choose between her husband and the love of her life.

 The film is based on a popular folk tale by noted Rajasthani writer Vijay Dan Detha.

 Detha?s story was first made into a film by Mani Kaul titled Duvidha.

 The Rajasthan desert in the film was originally to have been Computer-Generated Imagery, which would have made this the first Hindi film with a CGI background. But it proved too expensive ? so an artificial desert was created.

 The film was earlier titled Ghost Ka Dost before being called Paheli.

 Palekar had approached Shah Rukh the actor to play the dual roles of the husband and the ghost. But at the end of the script-reading session, Shah Rukh wanted to produce the film and also star in it.

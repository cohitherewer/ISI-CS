 Spare kids, cries mother

 - Exemption plea for children from divorce proceedings

 TAPAS GHOSH

 A woman, in the midst of divorce proceedings in the family court, has sent a written appeal to acting Chief Justice Altamas Kabir, that her three minor children be spared the ordeal of attending the proceedings.

 ?At a time when the courts are repeatedly asking warring parents to keep their children out of the mess, these three minors are being subjected to regular harassment, as they have to attend family court every week,? mother Gita Mahensaria told the high court last week.

 About three weeks ago, while hearing a maintenance case, Justice Amit Talukdar had referred to an apex court judgment and observed that children should not be dragged into the war of the roses in court.

 ?The courtroom scenes disturb their mental condition and affect their studies,? the judge had said.

 ?The observation inspired me to approach you. Please treat my letter as a petition and take suo motu action in this regard. I have no money to pay a lawyer,? Gita pleaded in her letter.

 She alleged that for her children ? Arjun, 9, Vidur, 6, and Vaidehi, 4, ? Thursdays had turned out to be a nightmare, as they had to attend court to meet their father, Anil Kumar Mahensaria, alias Laddu, a city-based businessman.

 Mahensaria is fighting a legal battle with wife Gita, demanding restitution of conjugal rights, and has obtained an order of the high court directing her to bring the children to court to meet him for an hour every Thursday.

 ?It is a very difficult task for me to bring three minors to court against their will. My children have been suffering mental agony and are falling ill frequently. This is hampering their studies, also,? the mother lamented. 

 She prayed that her children be spared the ?regular harassment?.

 Nine-year-old Arjun has recently undergone a major operation and the doctors have advised him complete rest till recovery. ?Arjun feels very tired after attending court every week,? Gita wrote.

 She, along with her three children, moved to her mother?s house in Teghoria after her husband allegedly asked her to appease a CBI officer who was handling a case against Mahensaria.

 ?I provide for my children by making floral bouquets at home. I don?t want them to grow up with a man like my husband,? Gita stated.

 She pleaded with the court that she could not afford to bring her children to court every week in a taxi.

 ?From Teghoria, on the northern fringes of the city, I have to bring them to the family court in central Calcutta by bus?,? wrote Gita.

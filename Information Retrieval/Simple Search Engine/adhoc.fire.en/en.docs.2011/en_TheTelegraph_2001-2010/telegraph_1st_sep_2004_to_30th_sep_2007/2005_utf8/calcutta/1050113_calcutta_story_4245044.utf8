 Justice cry in mother?s tears

 A STAFF REPORTER

CASE HISTORY

Date of fracture: February 6, 2003

Date of hospitalisation: February 7, 2003

Botched surgeries: Five in four months

Date of death: June 2, 2003

Case taken up in court: May 19, 2004

Number of accused: Five (orthopaedic surgeon D.K. Majumdar of SSKM Hospital, 

junior doctors Souvik Bardhan, Sandip Manna, Jayanta Mondol and Nirmalya Basu)

Total number of witnesses: 53

Number of court hearings to date: 28

Number of witnesses examined to date: Two (Rajnis? parents Manoj and Munni 

Patel)

?I am not testifying under anybody?s influence, I am just narrating what had happened to my only son, how he died.?

 That was how Munni Devi, mother of 17-year-old budding cricketer Rajnis Patel, responded to the defence query on whether she had consulted her husband before appearing in court on Wednesday.

 In the witness box for the second day, Munni Devi completed her testimony, before her cross-examination by the defence lawyers started at the Alipore court of sub-divisional judicial magistrate (SDJM) Manjit Singh.

 The day?s hearing began with public prosecutor Naba Kumar Ghosh asking Munni Devi to identify Dr D.K. Majumdar, which she did. 

 Majumdar was absent on Tuesday when Munni Devi had identified the four other accused.

 When Ghosh grilled her about how Rajnis? condition deteriorated after the second surgery, she broke down.

 ?We can all understand that what had happened to you was tragic, but you must try to control your sorrow so that we can get on with the hearing,? SDJM Singh said.

 Regaining some of her composure, Munni Devi said: ?Rajnis? injured leg started swelling and a lot of pus had formed. He was bleeding profusely. While the doctors pumped blood into his body intravenously, it just kept flowing out through his left leg. He also had high fever.?

 She added: ?I approached Dr D.K. Majumdar time and again, begging him to do something, but he did not visit Rajnis even once. Sometimes, he would send over one of the junior doctors.?

 Munni Devi recounted: ?They would simply tie a bandage on the wound or suspend the leg with a sling, but the blood kept flowing.? 

 Asked if she had anything to add, Munni Devi reiterated that she sought justice and punishment for the culprits.

 Defence counsel Dipit Basu objected to her statement, but it was overruled. 

 Advocate Tapan Choudhury, representing junior doctor Nirmalya Basu, then started the cross-examination. 

 Answering his questions, Munni Devi said she had complained to the SSKM Hospital superintendent about the negligence by the doctors. 

 She added that she had accompanied husband Manoj and his elder brother to their ancestral home in Hajipur, Bihar, on June 4, 2003, for Rajnis? last rites, and returned to the city on June 16. 

 Manoj later told Metro that he had lodged the first information report at Bhowanipore police station on June 3, a day before leaving for Bihar, naming only Dr D.K. Majumdar.

 Investigating officer Supriyo Pal had visited the Patel residence while they were out of town. He met them on June 20, 2003. In the course of the investigation, the four other names were included in the chargesheet.

 ?We had met the chief minister while the case was being investigated. He assured us that we would get justice,? Manoj recalled.

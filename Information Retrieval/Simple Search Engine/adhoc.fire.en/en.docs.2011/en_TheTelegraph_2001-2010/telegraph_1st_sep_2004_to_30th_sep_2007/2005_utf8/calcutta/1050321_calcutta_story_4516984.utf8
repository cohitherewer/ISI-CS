The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Dial 100 to keep cops posted

 BARUN KUMAR MULLICK, deputy commissioner of police (north and north suburban division), met readers of The Telegraph at his office to answer their queries. 

Participants included Sandip Banerjee, Diptimoy Ghosh, Kallol Dasgupta, Ramen Chaki and Soumya Halder

Sandip Banerjee:Activities of terrorists in the city have increased in recent times. Even the chief minister has expressed concern over the matter. Have you come across any such cases in your area?

 We have tightened patrolling to obtain information about terrorist activities in our area. But it is next to impossible to keep an eye on every lane and bylane, unless local people help us.

 There is a Dial 100 service, through which anyone can inform us about untoward incidents in their area. The information provided by callers is automatically relayed to the control room of the North division.

 It is not mandatory to disclose one?s identity. If a caller leaves his or her name and particulars, it will be kept confidential. Once every citizen becomes aware of the service, we will be better equipped to deal with the threat posed by terrorists.

Ramen Chaki: Fake currency notes are being widely circulated in the city. There are two major markets in your area. Do you think the trading hubs can be exchange points for fake notes? One such incident had taken place on Surya Sen Street, under Amherst Street police station, some time ago.

 We have not received any complaints relating to fake currency notes in the eight police stations under my jurisdiction. Neither have we arrested people from the area in this connection. However, it is possible that criminals are using the two markets under my area of jurisdiction to spread fake notes.

 As a counter-measure, we keep personnel posted in plainclothes in the market areas. We also maintain an active source network to keep track of such crimes. The detective department, which keeps a close watch on such activities, regularly shares information with police in this regard.

Kallol Dasgupta: What about pirated and photocopied books that are sold in College Street, which comes under your jurisdiction?

 Trade in pirated and photocopied books is on the rise in College Street and it is a big problem. As a large number of publishers operate from the area, it becomes easy to run a book piracy business there.

 Once the dummy of a book is made, it is sneaked into the market for copying and circulation. Publishers often complain to police against one another. We have conducted a number of raids in warehouses in various parts of the city and seized pirated books.

Ramen Chaki: An officer from Burtola police station was recently transferred after a few sex workers complained against him. The removal took place without an inquiry and must have had a demoralising effect on other officers. In addition to politicians, will the police officers now have to keep sex workers happy?

 A crime officer working in the Sovabazar area was transferred after some sex workers complained against him. He was initially asked to do office duty, but was later transferred to the division office.

 Such transfers are under the jurisdiction of a deputy commissioner and so, no inquiry was held. The transfer was necessary as otherwise, there would have been law and order problems in the area.

 We hold an inquiry when there is a serious complaint against an officer. In this case, the complaint was not of a serious nature. I can assure you that the officer was not discriminated against.

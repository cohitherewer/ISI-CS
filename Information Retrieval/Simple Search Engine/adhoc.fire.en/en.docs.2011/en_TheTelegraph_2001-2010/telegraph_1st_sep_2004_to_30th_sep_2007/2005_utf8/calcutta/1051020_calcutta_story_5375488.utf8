The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Three-hour cops ?n? blocks

Force told to shun force, act with tact

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Use tact and act is the simple motto the police force has been asked to adopt to tackle a not-so-simple situation ? Mamata Banerjee on a roadblock rampage.

 The Trinamul Congress chief has threatened to paralyse the city for at least three hours, between noon and 3 pm on Thursday, to protest the arrival of the Salim Group team.

 Mamata has not minced words while signalling trouble for the city ? from Dum Dum airport to Howrah station ? as her supporters take up position at various protest points along ? and beyond ? the route of the Salim Group visit.

 The missive from Mamata to her men (and women) is: demonstrate and block the movement of traffic.

 The missive from Lalbazar to its force is: deal with the demonstrations, but don?t be provoked.

 According to state home secretary Prasad Ranjan Roy, Salim Group?s Benny Santoso is expected to arrive in the city ?around 2 pm? and meet chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee ?around 5.30 pm?.

 ?So far, it has been decided that he will stay at the Oberoi Grand,? Roy said at Writers? Buildings on Wednesday afternoon. He ruled out the possibility of Santoso being brought into the city by helicopter to avoid the demonstrators.

 ?Santoso will not visit the site in Uluberia where the Salim group plans to set up a scooter factory,? Roy added. ?But he will stay overnight in the city and leave on Friday.?

 Senior officials of the state government as well as the police, however, made it clear that these plans and timings could change ?depending upon the situation?.

 Mamata reiterated on Wednesday that to protest the visit, her partymen would ensure that a ?bandh-like? situation prevailed in the city on Thursday afternoon.

 ?For us, the whole idea is to ensure that the visitors (Santoso and others from the Salim Group) move around smoothly in the city without facing any disruptions,? said Raj Kanojia, inspector-general of police (law and order).

 ?We have instructed our officers to proceed with tact, apply their presence of mind and act in a manner that would require minimal force. Police are not there to beat up people or demonstrators. That is not how we have decided to handle the situation on Thursday.?

 Police have also decided to deploy plainclothesmen in large numbers across the city. They will be armed with cell phones or wireless sets and their job will be to monitor the situation and keep the control room posted. ?We have decided to use this tactic because demonstrators often make policemen in uniform their targets, provoking a retaliation,? said an officer.

 Police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee said: ?Police will be there to handle the situation if the need arises.?

 Parents and students should go for counselling at least three to four months before the Board exams. But in Bengal, most schools are not equipped with trained counsellors. This has to change. Stressed children end up affecting parents. The other day a mother committed suicide before her daughter?s exam. In our experience, we have seen how helpless parents are, pressured by the education system, the school and the demanding children. When a child takes his/her life, the blame is put on the parents. But a single altercation at home cannot be the reason. It is only when the students reach a saturation point of stress do they take the extreme step. We conducted free workshops in some schools before the Board exams. Eighty-five per cent of the students said they were too nervous to concentrate.

 Yes. The problem arises out of the difference between a child?s perception of his/her ability and that of the parents?. Students suffering from low self-esteem need to be encouraged, just as parents should learn not to be demanding. There are two kinds of parents ? one, that never bothered about the child?s progress and suddenly wakes up before the exams; the other is that which regards the exam as the last lap and scolds the child for not being prepared for it. If schools take the initiative to hire counsellors, it would help parents as most do not know which way to turn.

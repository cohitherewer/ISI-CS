 Post-deluge, civic review of sewers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The civil engineering and drainage and sewerage wings of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation have started a joint review of the drainage capacity of the city?s storm sewer system.

 Rain over six days had marooned more than 100,000 Calcuttans last week. The outcry over waterlogging in several parts of the city has prompted the civic move. 

 The departments have been given a month to submit their report. They have also been asked to suggest improvement schemes to the municipal commissioner.

 The CMC has also announced a Rs-2 crore ?special drainage project? for 2005. 

 It has indicated that the investment in drainage will be hiked next year.

 As part of the project, silt will be scooped out of the brick sewers, obstructions to the flow of sewerage will be identified and removed, and a high-pressure suction-cum-jetting machine will be procured to clean the sewers. 

 ?Calcutta?s drainage system needs a review first. Without that, no scheme can be drawn up to improve the city?s bailing-out capacity during monsoon,? said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya.

 ?The six-day spell last week has proved that the drainage capacity of the city is less than half of what the civic engineers had claimed over the past two or three decades,? pointed out municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.

 ?If less than 10 mm of rain an hour cannot cause waterlogging in the city, why was Calcutta inundated for a couple of days after an average rainfall of 3.5 mm per hour?? asked the municipal commissioner.

 Bandyopadhyay said the 180-km brick sewer system of the city was laid by the British and is over 175 years old. It was designed to prevent waterlogging at less than 20 mm of rain per hour. 

 With the growth of the city, the number of drainage and sewerage arteries has increased. Calcutta now has 1,400 km of sewer pipes, 2,000 km of branch sewers and 900 km of surface drain.

 The maintenance and cleaning work of the brick sewers were stopped after Independence, said a retired drainage chief engineer. He added that by the late 1970s, about 50 per cent of the channels were filled with silt and they had become incapable of preventing waterlogging if there was more than 10 mm of rain per hour. 

 The civic engineers have not carried out an overhaul of the system since the 1970s but still maintain that less than 10 mm of rain per hour will not cause in waterlogging.

 During last week?s wet spell, the total rainfall was about 400 mm and the average intensity, 3.2 mm per hour. Calcutta had seen more intense rainfall in 1978, 1984 and 1986. But according to at least two former drainage chief engineers, the waterlogging was as bad as in those three years.

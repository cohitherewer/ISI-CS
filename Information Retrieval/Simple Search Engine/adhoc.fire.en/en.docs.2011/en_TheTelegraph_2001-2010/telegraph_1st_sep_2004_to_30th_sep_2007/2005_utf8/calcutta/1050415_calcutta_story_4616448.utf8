 Nod for medical college

 - Quota cry for doctors? children on Kamarhati campus

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The state government will set up a medical college and hospital in partnership with the Indian Medical Association (IMA). The project cost has been pegged at Rs 100 crore.

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Thursday gave the green light to the IMA for the medical college at Kamarhati, with active support from the state government. ?The proposal is good and we have decided to help the IMA set up the new medical college here,? stressed the chief minister.

 The IMA, meanwhile, has introduced an intriguing argument in its pitch for another medical college. A pre-condition for setting up the hospital, according to the association, is reservation of seats for doctors? children.

 ?There are many doctors who cannot afford steep capitation fees and so their children cannot study medicine. All these doctors will benefit from some kind of reservation up to a maximum of 50 per cent,? said Sanjiv Malik, national president-elect of the IMA.

 ?The state, too, will get quality doctors, as those who pass out from this quota must serve in rural areas for the first three years. These modalities have to be worked out,? Malik added.

 The reservation of seats for doctors? children has already raised uncomfortable questions for the IMA. ?I don?t think this is feasible or ethical,? felt Kunal Saha, a founder member of the organisation People for Better Treatment.

 But the Bengal government is bullish about the project. Addressing doctors on the occasion of the platinum jubilee celebrations of the Journal of Indian Medical Association (JIMA), the chief minister said: ?Others have approached us, but it is better that we do something with the IMA,? said Bhattacharjee.

 With the government willing to work hand in hand with the IMA, the biggest representative body of doctors in India, an IMA delegation will meet the government soon for talks. 

 ?We have identified the dilapidated Sagar Dutta Memorial Hospital and the adjoining ESI Hospital grounds at Kamarhati, about 15 km north of the city, as the suitable site for the new medical college,? said Sudipto Roy, IMA national president.

 The medical college will be set up on 25 acres at an estimated cost of Rs 100 crore. The government will provide the land and the building, while IMA will provide funds for equipment and to form the faculty for the new college.

 ?We will have a 500-bed hospital, state-of-the-art laboratories and 150 medical students in the college,? said Roy.

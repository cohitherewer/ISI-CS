The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 ?You can impress even in a multi-starrer?

a stage show, his look in Elaan, with Nana Patekar and Suniel Shetty at 

a cricket match, and with Amisha Patel in Vaada 

 After being off the big screen for quite some time, ARJUN RAMPAL has back-to-back releases in Vaada and Elaan. Pratim D. Gupta talks to the model-turned-actor on the path left behind and the road ahead.

 Out of nowhere you have two releases in 

two weeks ?Vaada and Elaan?

(Laughs) Yes! Here in Bollywood you can?t really 

plan release dates. Vaada was supposed to come out last year but that it 

released in 2005 can?t be helped. I am not really worried that two films of mine 

are releasing back-to-back. Not only have I not had a release for a long time 

(last was Rajiv Rai?s Asambhav), but also both the films are totally different 

and so are the characters.

 In both the films you are sharing 

screen space with other heroes. Will multi-starrers help your status in Bollywood?

 I think it is the story which is important. And also how well you can characterise your character. The role has to be defined. All these factors have to be looked at, at the script level. Multi-starrers in no way is a safe option. Even if you have more than one lead actor, you can still make an impression.

 You did make your debut as a solo 

hero in Moksha. Today when you look back, was it an ideal launchpad for 

Arjun Rampal the actor?

 Definitely. Moksha offered me a lot to explore as an actor. I was in very, very good hands. It was an excellent opportunity for me to understand the medium of film-making. The film was an education for me as well as a great launch.

 Why get into films in the first 

place?

 I like acting. I always wanted to get into movies. I have grown up watching a whole lot of films. There have always been a lot of offers. But I kept wondering whether to get into films or not. Moksha fitted the bill perfectly.

 But Pyar Ishq Aur Mohabbat was 

your breakthrough film?

 Yes, largely. Rajiv (Rai) and I have worked together before in music videos. He saw the rushes of Moksha and told me: ?I am doing a new film. Would you like to do it?? Rajiv was a good friend and I knew there would be a strong comfort level. So I said yes.

 You haven?t made the best choices 

since then. How do you select a film?

 Yes, I signed a few films after that. You learn as you go along in this industry. People around you educate you. Today if I were to sign a film, it has to be a bound script. There was no such thing before. All the ideas were in the air. Now it is much more formal and one can really know everything before signing on the dotted line.

 Are you trying to project an image? 

You went all action with Asambhav last year?

 I love doing action. I love watching action films. I did it first hands-on in Deewanapan. Action is something which comes naturally to me. I would love to do one action film every year.

 What went wrong with Asambhav?

 I don?t think it?s fair to sit and analyse with the media as to what went wrong. I can analyse myself but eventually you have to just go ahead and make another film. There is no point in getting into what could have gone right and all that.

 What is Vaada all about?

 It is a thriller but it is also a romantic film in the sense that there are love interests involved. I play a blind man who is very serious and very smart. What appealed to me was the story of Vaada, revolving around these three characters. It is a very different screenplay with the point of view of every person shown properly.

 How was it like working with an 

actor-turned-director like Satish Kaushik?

 I love the way he has shot Vaada. He is a wonderful actor himself and understands direction well. He also believes in taking chances which is very important. The film has already fetched a lot of positive reviews and all of our performances have been appreciated. It feels good, very encouraging.

 And what about your co-stars, Amisha 

Patel and Zayed Khan?

 I am very fond of Amisha. She is a very chilled out person and a lot of fun to work with. She is also very, very co-operative. It?s also great pulling her leg all the time on the sets. Also, we know whom to go to when we are hungry; Amisha always has food. I am also working with her in Elaan and Humko Tumse Pyar Hai.

 As for Zayed, he is from my school. He is a bright young guy and should come up really well in the future.

 That brings us to Elaan, 

releasing this Friday?

 Oh! Elaan is one of the nicest action films in Bollywood. It is shot beautifully and the edit pattern used in the film is quite unique. I can?t describe it for the print medium. In fact, it is the edit style which attracted me to do the film. In the film, we all play these different characters on this mission against the bad guy played by Mithun Chakraborty. 

 How was it like working with Bengal?s 

best, Mithunda?

 He is a very intelligent actor. Of course, he is one of those big actors you?ve watched all these years. So when you look at him, you look at him with that respect. And he totally earns it. He made me feel so comfortable when we met for the first time on the sets. I was obviously on guard but he announced straightaway: ?You either call me Mithun or Dada.? And we have had such interesting conversations on acting. It?s amazing to know that an actor like Mithunda believes in Stanislavsky and method acting. He is a great guy ? a wonderful human being. 

 And what other films is Arjun Rampal 

working on?

 There?s a thriller named Yakeen with Priyanka Chopra. A comedy, Dil Sachcha Chehra Jhootha with Dia Mirza. And Humko Tumse Pyar Hai with Amisha.

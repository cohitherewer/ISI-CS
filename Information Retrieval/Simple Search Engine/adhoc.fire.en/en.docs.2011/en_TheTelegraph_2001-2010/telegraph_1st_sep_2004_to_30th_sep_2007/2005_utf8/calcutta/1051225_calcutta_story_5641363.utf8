 Chill while you cheer

 HOW TO PUT TOGETHER A RUSHED YET RELAXED XMAS BASH

 You ushered in Christmas with a heavy-duty night of club hopping ? rocked till sunrise, downed one shooter after the other, boogied in those killer heels and left your partner freezing by borrowing his jacket. Chances are, youve woken up with a throbbing head and bleary visions of last nights revelry. So, its time to take it a bit easy today. 

 But Christmas being Christmas, theres no way you cant care about the cheer in the air. If you want to stay in on Sunday and yet have a blast, heres the GoodLife guide to an impromptu Xmas bash, lounge style.

 Set the mood

 Dont go overboard with Santas, snowmen and streamers ? its not a kindergarten bash, after all.

 But do add the Yuletide touch with a few small accessories: a mistletoe here and a stocking there.

 In keeping with the festive colour code, make red and green the theme of the d?cor. A few red, scented candles placed strategically, fluffy cushions and strings of colourful bulbs are all that you need to set the mood.

 Welcome your guests by handing out fluffy, red elf caps.

Do 

 Host a relaxed lounge party to de-stress after the rocking night 

 Work around the green-and-red theme 

 Emphasise on the dessert spread and include the Christmas specialities 

 Dont

 Go overboard with Christmas decor and carols 

Tune talk

 The Christmas eve party mood is sure to carry itself forward into the next day and so thrown in with a great deal of rocking CDs is a merry bunch of retro stuff.

 Though the choice of music depends largely on the mood and ambience, perennial Xmas favourites like Last Christmas are sure to touch chords. Similarly, people invariably enjoy their dose of Bob Marley, Tina Turner and Whitney Houston, feels DJ Girish of Shisha. 

 Though the youngsters prefer R amp;B, Hip Hop and newer tracks from Bluffmaster, theres nothing to beat relaxing lounge music to soothe your system after hardcore hungama.

 Sip and bite

 You just cant get through this Christmas without treating your friends to the sinful fare offered by every other confectioner in town, right from the chocolatey delicacies from Kookie Jar to the traditional home-made fruit cakes from Bow Barracks. So, keep the main course minimal and lay an elaborate dessert spread.

 In keeping with the mood of the day, organising a barbecue menu that will act as both finger food as well as the main course is a good idea. A simple dish of Chicken Roast with Brown Sauce and Mashed Potatoes should suffice for the main course, says restaurateur Naveen Pai.

 Go overboard with the sweet endings. Cinnamon stars, reindeer cookies, Santa lollipops, plum puddings? the choice can be as wide as ever.

 Finish off the evening with some after-dinner coffee drinks like Cointreau Machiato or Baileys Latte.

 Add a special touch with personalised Xmas table accessories like Santa stirrers, printed red-and-green paper napkins and vibrant crockery.

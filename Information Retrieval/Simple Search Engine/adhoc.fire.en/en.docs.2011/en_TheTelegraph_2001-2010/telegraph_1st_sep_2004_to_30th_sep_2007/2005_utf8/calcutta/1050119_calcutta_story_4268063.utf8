 Rediscovering human values

 The collective cultural consciousness of several generations owes a great deal to Rabindranath Tagore, the single luminary who has had an enduring influence on our thoughts, words and actions, and the way we conduct ourselves in everyday life. As a fitting tribute to Bengal?s cultural prophet, Ananda Shankar Centre for Performing Arts presents Chirantan, a ballet that attempts to rediscover and reinforce the eternal human values that have served to distinguish our rich cultural heritage, but which, unfortunately, now seems almost forgotten. Conceived and choreographed by Tanusree Shankar, the dance performance is built around the theme of honour and self-belief, born out of a respect for the past and its traditions. With music composed and arranged by Debajyoti Mishra and narration by Amitabh Bachchan, it depicts through a beautiful combination of words, music and dance, excerpts from Tagore?s vast works, emphasising values like truth, peace, love and spirituality.

What 

can you expect at the birthday bash of a four-year-old? Loads of friends, some 

great music and tons of masti.

 That?s exactly what you would have found at the fourth birthday celebrations of Swabhumi on Sunday evening. More than 1,000 guests dropped by to attend the celebrations and witness performances by four of the country?s top artists. 

 Titled Chaturang, the event was to be a m?lange of 

dance and music. The breezy February evening opened with the performance by Sharon 

Lowen, an Odissi dancer who set the mood of the evening with her grace and well-composed 

pieces. As guests began to pour into the open-air Urban Courtyard, the venue for 

the evening, not just the chairs and the sofas, but even the balconies overlooking 

the square filled with curious shoppers and casual passers-by. 

 Actress Debasree Roy and her troupe were second to take the stage, putting up an half-hour choreographed piece on the Nav Raas, or the nine emotions of a human being ? from anger to compassion. Using props and the support of her troupe, the display was a lively one.

Percussionist Tanmoy Bose came next, with a group 

of talented musicians and vocal artists. Musicians from Birbhum and their counterparts 

from New York added power to his performance. From jamming with the traditional 

dhak to creating music with a mix of jazz, the crowd cheered, clapped and 

foot-tapped the ensemble on.

 Closing the show past 9 pm, Sobhanaa and her students showcased pieces purely traditional as well as those infused with western beats thanks to Bose at the drums. A self-composed piece in tribute to the Goddess at Dakshineswar won the dancer a resounding round of applause.

 Tango tale

 Two sets of couples run into a string of conflicts. That?s Two to Tango, Raell Padamsee?s cocktail theatre to be hosted by The Park on Wednesday. Comprising four one-act plays, the tongue-in-cheek production probes the ups and downs of man-woman relationships in an urban, contemporary setting. Directed by Vikranth Pawar, the cast features TV actress Tanaaz Currim, Vinay Jain, Digvijay Savant and Dilnaz Irani. Part of Padamsee?s endeavour to take theatre out of auditoriums, the play has been performed to packed houses in Delhi and Mumbai.

 Vivaha wear

 Sangeeta?s boutique on Rawdon Street has unveiled its vivaha collection ? a range of embroidered two-piece and two-piece saris ? with discounts up to 50 per cent, to mark its seventh anniversary. ?The idea is to come closer to our customers by providing them with a wide array of saris and lehngas in different fabrics and colours,? says owner Jugal Kishore. 

 The saris come in bright festive colours like fuchsia, red, burgundy, orange, mehndi and firoza on fabrics like crepe, georgette, and chiffon. Embellished with antique work, sequins, mirror work, kundan, stones and machine embroidery, the saris, start at Rs 1,700.

 However, the highlight of the latest collection are the two-piece and three-piece saris that come in bright colours like magenta, yellow and blue on georgette, jamewar and patti, priced above Rs 6,000.

Primarily in rich bridal hues like red, orange and 

maroon, the lehngas are available in a variety of designs including A-line 

and mermaid cuts. Antique zardosi and sequins are the main emphasis on 

the lehngas. These are priced higher, starting at Rs 7,500.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Enter, clinic for hand repairs

 A STAFF REPORTER

 When 16-year-old Sourish Mukherjee broke his arm in an accident a month ago, he was rushed to a city hospital, where doctors repaired his multiple-fractured arm. 

 But post-operative complications, along with unavailability of doctors when required, cost Sourish his arm.

 In Calcutta, six to 10 botched-up hand surgical cases land up in private hospitals, resulting in a redo surgery or extensive repair work, which not only drains a patient financially, but ruins his/her chances of a return to normal life.

 To address the problem, Apollo Gleneagles Hospital on Thursday launched eastern India?s first-ever specialist hand surgery clinic. Apart from the usual repair work, the clinic will deal with trauma, infections and tumours.

 ?Treatment of the hand requires attention to both the bone structure and the tendons. A comprehensive handcare programme, therefore, requires the combined efforts of an orthopaedic surgeon, a plastic surgeon and a physiotherapist. The expertise will be available at our clinic,? orthopaedic surgeon Buddhadeb Chatterjee told Metro. 

 Apart from Chatterjee, plastic surgeon Gautam Basu and physical medicine expert Sanjay Chatterjee will be available every morning from 9 am. 

 Ahini Banerjee, 16, broke her arm and could have even lost it after hurting herself on a windowpane. ?When Ahini arrived here, I was saddened by her plight. We took extra care and repaired her arm and today, she is back to writing and doing normal work with her right hand. It was then that we realised that a hand repair clinic was what the city needed,? said surgeon Basu.

 The clinic was inaugurated on Thursday by sheriff Chuni Goswami and hand surgery expert A.K. Das. 

 An overwhelmed Goswami said: ?As a sportsman, I have seen just how much of a difference specialised care can make. An injury to the hand, if not treated properly, can cause even permanent damage. I am delighted that Apollo Gleneagles has brought this specialised care to the people.?

 Now, the hospital gets around 15-20 hand injury cases, accidental as well as industrial, a month. 

 ?Almost half the cases had been mismanaged at some stage. We have, therefore, decided to make maximum use of the clinic at a very nominal cost to ensure that even poor patients can avail of its facilities,?surgeon Chatterjee explained. 

 ?What people don?t realise is that a leg, with multiple fractures, can be healed relatively easier than a hand, that has 29 bones and 50 muscles, working simultaneously,? he added.

 Water crisis frays tempers

 - Blockade, clash over supply; six breaches plugged in mains

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The water crisis in the city reached such alarming proportions on the second day on Friday that about 250 angry residents of central Calcutta, including around 100 women, blocked the CR Avenue-Tarak Pramanik Road intersection at 9 am, throwing peak-hour traffic off gear.

 A police contingent, sent to the spot around 9.30 am, dispersed the protesters.

 At the same time, engineers grappled with as many as six holes in the 60-inch-diameter underground water mains at Mullickbazar. 

 Chief engineer (water supply) Dibyendu Roychaudhury said the repair work is far from over. ?To complete the repair work, we will have to shut down the Tallah-Palta water supply network once again tonight,? he said.

 Municipal commissioner Debashis Som visited the site at Mullickbazar in the morning. According to mayoral council member (water supply) Sovan Chatterjee, about a dozen holes had been detected in the water mains. 

 ?It took 18 hours for our officers to plug the six holes ? each of about three-inch diameter ? with wooden wedges. Work continued till early this morning. Now, the plugged areas will have to be wrapped in iron jackets and properly welded,? he explained. 

 The 40-year-old mains delivers 80 million gallons of filtered water from Tallah to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) booster pumping station at Auckland Square. 

 To provide relief, the civic authorities supplied water at low pressure for about two hours on Friday morning. 

 But, as the Tallah-Palta supply network had to be shut down for the repair of the water mains in Mullickbazar, the booster stations in Bagmari, Mohammad Ali Park, Park Circus and Ranikuthi could not be operated, resulting in an acute water scarcity. 

 People with buckets formed snaking queues in front of civic water taps in various areas. 

 The civic authorities also sent water tankers to some areas, known as low-pressure zones, like Beleghata, Pearabagan, Entally, Tiljala and Kasba. 

 But the tankers had to be withdrawn soon, following a clash between two groups of people over where a tanker should supply water first in the Beniapukur area. 

 Vast stretches of north, south and central Calcutta were hit. Behala, Garden Reach, Jadavpur, Golf Green and the Bansdroni areas were not spared, either.

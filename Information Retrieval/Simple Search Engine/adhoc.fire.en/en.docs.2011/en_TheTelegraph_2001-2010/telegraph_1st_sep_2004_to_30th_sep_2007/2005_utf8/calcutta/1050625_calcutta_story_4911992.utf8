 Calcutta University?s B.Sc Part I (gen) exam in mathematics will be held on June 29. The revised dates of 15 other exams will be declared later

 Primary Teachers? Training exam of the state primary education board will be held on June 30

 Many city schools have decided to remain closed in view of the state transport strike on Monday. Many more whose buses are run by private operators might be forced to call off classes.

 Nopany Vidyalaya, Mahadevi Birla Girls? School, Heritage School, Julien Day School, Ganganagar, DPS Megacity, South Point School and MP Birla Foundation Higher Secondary School have already declared a holiday on Monday.

 ?We will be working on Saturday to make up for the academic loss,? said Meenakshi Atal, founder-headmistress, Heritage School. Julien Day, too, has similar plans. J.K. Sen, the school?s principal, said: ?Many of our buses are run by private operators and will not be allowed to ply on the bandh day. So, there is no point in keeping the school open on Monday.?

 The educational institutions that have their own fleet of buses plan to hold normal classes.

 ?Our buses will come and we will function normally on that day,? said Modern High School principal Devi Kar. 

 Monday will also be a working day for Lakshmipat Singhania Academy, St James? School and La Martiniere for Boys and Girls.

 However, R.A. Flynn, principal, La Martiniere for Boys, added: ?We have told our students and staff that if they face any problem, they need not come.? 

 St James?s authorities are also aware that many students might not be able to make it. ?However, we can?t declare a holiday officially,? said Angela Ghose, headmistress, St James? School.

 Montoo Rakhit, principal, Calcutta Girls? High School, said: ?If the strike is not withdrawn by Sunday night, we will take a decision.? Ashok Hall will stay open on Monday only if its bus drivers and conductors turn up.

 Counselling sessions for WBJEE 2005-qualified students (general ranks), scheduled to be conducted by the central selection committee of the State Joint Entrance Board on June 27, will be held on June 28 instead. The original schedule from June 28 to July 6 has been deferred by a day each. 

 Sixteen undergraduate and postgraduate examinations of Calcutta University scheduled to be held on June 27 have been postponed (see chart above).

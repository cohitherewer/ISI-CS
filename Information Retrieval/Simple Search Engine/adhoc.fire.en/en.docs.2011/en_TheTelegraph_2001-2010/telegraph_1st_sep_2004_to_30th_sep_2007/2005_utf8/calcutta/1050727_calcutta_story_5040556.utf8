The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Gods must be happy

 That rsquo;s what director Pankuj Parashar feels, having wrapped up his 45-day Banaras shooting schedule without a hitch. He spoke to Pratim D. Gupta about showcasing India rsquo;s oldest city through the Urmila Matondkar-starrer

 Ashmit Patel with Urmila Matondkar in Banaras: A Mystic Love Story

 From paan, tawaif and babu to ghats, temples and forts ? the Varanasi-Bollywood connection is all set for a complete turnaround, once Pankuj Parashar?s new film Banaras: A Mystic Love Story hits the theatres. The maker of such masala potboilers as Chaalbaaz, Himalayaputra and Tumko Na Bhool Payenge, Pankuj is back to his film school days when mainstream commerce was not his concern.

 ?I have been an FTII gold medallist,? says Pankuj, in town on Tuesday. ?There also, I made very different kind of films including an award-winning documentary. But once out of FTII, I went the other way. Now, after all these years, I have been able to make an honest attempt at something different. Twenty years back I wouldn?t have been able to make a film like this.?

 Banaras, funded and co-written (with Javed Siddiqui) by first-time producer L.C. Singh, stars Urmila Matondkar as a physics student who falls in love with a music teacher, played by Ashmit Patel, on the Benaras Hindu University (BHU) campus. What follows is the inevitable clash of ideologies, a conflict of thoughts around caste, creed and faith. The film has a stellar supporting cast comprising Naseeruddin Shah, Dimple Kapadia, Raj Babbar and Akash Khurana.

 ?Till date, other films have had no clue about what to show in Varanasi,? says Pankuj. ?They haven?t just got inside the place. Come on, this is the oldest city of India, a country still reduced to a three-location tourist destination. When I met a foreigner a week back at Goa and told him that the first Buddhist sermon happened in Varanasi, he started looking it up on Google.?

 Ninety-five per cent of Banaras has been shot on location and the rest in Mauritius. Historic locations like the BHU campus, Sarnath, Krishnamurthy Foundation, Kabir Math, Tulsidas?s Haveli, Vishwanath Mandir, Assi Ghat, Vyas Temple, have been canned by cinematographer Neerav Shah, who shot Dhoom recently. Himesh Reshammiya has scored the music and BHU graduate Sameer has penned the lyrics.

 ?All the five songs are rooted to the Benaras gharana but the treatment is very today,? says producer Singh, who was a vice-president with TCS before starting his software company. ?Now, we cannot preach like Astha channel but we want to reach out 

 to the young generation, who would rather watch movies these days than read books. So we have camouflaged everything in a modern package.?

 On the surface, Banaras is a Shakespearean love story, feels Pankuj. ?It is a romance between two categories but since it happens in Varanasi, it takes on a different dimension altogether. It was lovely to work with Urmila, who falls in the same category as Madhuri (Dixit) and Sridevi, with whom I have worked before. 

 ?As for Naseer, he hasn?t yet read the script. When I offered him the role, he just asked me to send the scenes. And Dimple, well, she was so excited about shooting in Varanasi that she used to wake up daily at 4.30 in the morning, wake me up, and together we would go to the Vishwanath Temple for the hour-long abhishek.?

Both director and producer feel that the gods were smiling on the project. ?This is my 14th film and for the first time, nothing went wrong during the 45-day shooting schedule in Varanasi,? reveals Pankuj. ?Not a single glass broke. There were 90 flights up and down and not a single one was late, which is a miracle of sorts. And when we went to Mauritius for the three-day schedule there, it had been raining there but it stopped and we could shoot.?

 But the biggest mini miracle of all was the filming schedule being hassle free. ?They scrap the film, they send the makers back home,? says Pankuj, obviously referring to Deepa Mehta?s Water woes. ?That?s primarily because the location is mostly misrepresented on celluloid. So what we did was give the local people and BHU students the script and schedule six months before the start and then invited them to be on the sets and make suggestions.?

 The plan worked, and so Banaras is sitting pretty on the editing table awaiting post-production and special effects before being unleashed some Friday in November.

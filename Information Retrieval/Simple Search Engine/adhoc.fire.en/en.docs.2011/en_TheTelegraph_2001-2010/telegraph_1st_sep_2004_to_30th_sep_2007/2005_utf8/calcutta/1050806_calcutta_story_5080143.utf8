 - Calcutta University upbeat over UGC excellence status

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta University?s prospects of winning a ?centre of excellence? status, awarded by the University Grants Commission (UGC), looked bright on Friday. 

 But the chances of bagging this UGC honour latest by Friday suffered a setback, with UGC officers making a last-minute decision in Delhi to announce their verdict some time later this month.

 In 2002, Calcutta University had missed the status when the UGC selected only Jadavpur University from Bengal for the honour. 

 The commission on Friday decided to announce the verdict after discussing the presentation reports of Calcutta University and nine other short-listed universities across the country among commission members.

 A team of Calcutta University officers, headed by Asis Kumar Banerjee, vice-chancellor, made a presentation in Delhi on Thursday, seeking the ?excellence? tag. ?We hope to know the results soon,? the vice-chancellor said.

 Calcutta and the nine other universities in the fray made their presentations in Delhi over the past three days. The standing committee of the UGC on Friday reviewed the presentation reports and conveyed its recommendations to the commission.

 If the UGC confers the status of an ?institution having the potential of a centre of excellence?, Calcutta University will get an additional grant of Rs 30 crore.

 In addition to that sum, the university will be able to undertake a number of schemes for holistic development of the institution and also be able to upgrade its laboratories and infrastructure to conduct international-grade research in science.

 ?We are satisfied with our presentation and the response of the standing committee was very positive. It has indicated that we have a fair chance of winning the status this time,? said a senior officer of Calcutta University, who was on the presentation team.

 Highly-placed officers in Delhi said the UGC is expected to hold the final round of meetings to make the announcement during the next few days. 

 The UGC had introduced the ?excellence? award to upgrade the universities in 2002. At that time, the UGC had shortlisted 25 universities and both Jadavpur and Calcutta universities were contestants then. Apart from Jadavpur in Bengal, the four other universities which won the status were JNU, University of Hyderabad, Pune University and Madras University.

 The UGC again invited proposals from UGC-recognised universities this year to make the second round of selections.

 Rich blooms for charm offensive

 Roses to Amsterdam. Tuberoses to Dubai. And now, pujor phul to the US and UK. Bengal?s flower power is going from strength to strength and Mullickghat is expected to do business between Rs 50 lakh and Rs 1 crore in the festive season.

 Thanks to the charm offensive by the state?s horticulture department, a string of Bengal puja committees abroad has sought flowers from Mullickghat to perform puja the traditional way. 

 While the bulk of the orders is from the Bengalis settled in the US and UK, state horticulture department sources claim orders have trickled in from other countries as well, including Canada, where the group is smaller but arrangements are elaborate. 

 According to members of the Mullickghat Phoolbazar Parichalan Samity, the total order from abroad is close to 150 kg. This has compelled Mullickghat market to work in three shifts.

 ?Around 40 puja organisers from abroad have placed orders with us, seeking all types of flowers that are part of the ritual. This includes wood apple and its leaves and others that are a necessary part of the puja,? says Subrata Basu, deputy manager, West Bengal Horticulture Development Corporation.

 So, just as there will be tuberoses and marigold, both red and orange, the consignments will include packets of garlands made of these flowers, and the lotus as well. Since lotuses have a very short shelf life, the bulk of these has been sent to cold chambers before being packed carefully.

 The biggest order of pujor phul till date is from two NRI Bengalis ? Aurobinda Mukherjee of Middlesex, UK, and Mihir Bose of New Jersey, in the US. While a few of them have asked for the consignments on October 9, most have sought flowers on October 12, the last day of Durga puja. 

 Members of the Mullickghat Phoolbazar Parichalan Samity are working overtime to meet local demands as well. With the demand already reaching an all-time high, prices have soared. This year, the demand is for about 1.2 million lotuses, 400,000 marigold garlands and around eight million china roses, or jaba.

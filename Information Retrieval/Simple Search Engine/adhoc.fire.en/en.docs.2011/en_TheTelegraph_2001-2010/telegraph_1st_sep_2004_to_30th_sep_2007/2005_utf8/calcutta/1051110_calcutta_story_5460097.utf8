 Stained decor: Dhakis with plumed drums in action at a pandal 

 Apropos the report ?Task force in offing?, October 14, it is amazing that over a dozen civic projects have been lying incomplete for over a decade. The present civic board should speed up the formation of a task force to decide the future of the pending projects. 

 Are the projects not being completed due to faulty planning? Or is there a lack of coordination between the planning and executing authorities? In a democratic set-up, civic boards might well change after elections, but why should project work suffer because of that? 

 The mayor and the councillors do not do the project work, they merely oversee it. Why can?t they hand over a list of the unfinished projects and their status reports to the new board at the end of their term? The new board can then continue the work on a priority basis. 

 Details of incomplete projects should be made available in the public domain, especially since ordinary people are interested in the progress of civic projects. 

 The tendency to ignore the incomplete work of the previous board on political grounds leads to a waste of tax-payers? money. That must be prevented at all costs. 

 New schemes should be given a priority over ongoing projects only if that is in the interest of the tax-payers. An incomplete project should be left unattended only if the civic House gives the go-ahead after a detailed debate. 

 Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

 Behala. 

 Apropos the report ?Plumed drums beat death knell?, October 1, it is shocking that thousands of birds, many of them of the protected species, are killed each year only to decorate the dhaks. 

 The puja organisers can help stop this slaughter by refusing to employ dhakis who decorate their instrument with real plumes. Artificial feathers and pith decorations would look just as fine on the dhaks. 

 Forest department officials, too, should act immediately to protect our feathered friends. 

 Sourish Misra,

 The gesture by Barisha Shakti Sangha to help Rimi Sardar, a young AIDS victim, by curtailing their puja budget is a noble act indeed (Puja pitches in for AIDS patient, October 6). 

 However, the comment by the secretary of the puja committee that they decided to help the child only after discovering that she hails from a ?humble background? could be misinterpreted. No child can be infected with HIV for any fault of his own. Why should the background of a young AIDS patient be a factor for help? 

 The blood bank that supplied Rimi the infected blood must be made to pay for her treatment. 

 Kunal Saha,

 Columbus, Ohio. 

 The trend of thalassaemic children getting infected with HIV during blood transfusion is worrying. Barisha Shakti Sangha deserves praise for using a portion of their Puja budget to help an AIDS-afflicted child. The club?s plans to hold a string of shows in January to collect funds for the girl?s treatment also deserves kudos. Other organisations should be encouraged by the noble deed. 

 Dalim Kumar Datta,

 APC Roy Road. 

 Most organisers spend their money in decorating and illuminating pandals during the Puja. Very few spare a thought for the underprivileged or show any kind of social commitment. In the race to bag prizes and honours, all other aspects of life are ignored. The organisers should follow the footsteps of the Barisha club. 

 Ratan Kumar Halder,

 Behala.

 The story of the four cancer patients has touched me immensely (Cancer conquered, the battle rages on, October 7). Being a cancer patient myself, I can feel for their endeavour to survive and appreciate their spirit. In October 2003, I was diagnosed with breast cancer, which spread to my spine by 2005 and has now affected my lungs. But the disease has not dented my desire to live like a normal person. Being positive is the best way to battle cancer. Thank you for helping innumerable people like me to keep their chin up. 

 Purnima Vasudeva, 

 Rowland Road. 

 The lives of the four cancer patients are inspiring. Not only did they not break down on learning about their affliction, but they also fought the disease to the hilt. Most importantly, the four provided courage to other cancer patients to not go down without a fight. 

 Sunil Banerjee, 

 VIP Road. 

 It is great news that the chairman of an international group wants to set up boarding schools in West Bengal that would be on a par with those in the Doon valley, Delhi and Bangalore, to attract children of NRIs living in the SAARC countries and the West (Boarding schools eye NRIs, October 6). It remains to be seen whether the venture takes off in Left-ruled Bengal. Presidency College and Visva-Bharati once used to be institutions of international standing. Their standard has gone down steadily due to the faulty education policy of the state. 

 Govinda Bakshi,

 Budge Budge. 

 The Goodlife on October 5 and 6 featured mouthwatering Mughlai and Bengali treats that were on offer at the best of the city restaurants during the Puja. Unfortunately, the majority of The Telegraph readers will not be able to afford a meal at these restaurants. 

 Kanchan Mookherjee,

 Address not given. 

 Apropos the report ?Rare frames of fauna?, October 7, it was interesting to know that Aranyak organises a wildlife photography competition. Awareness about flora and fauna in the state should be generated through all possible means. With winter approaching, the government should pitch in and provide protection to migratory birds that nest in and around the city. 

 Prahlad Agarwala,

 Majdia, Nadia. 

 Apropos ?Garbage under privatisation?, October 12, the claim of a civic official that 700 private workers, with an annual budget of Rs 6 crore, can match the output of 12,000 conservancy department employees working on a budget of Rs 43 crore, sounds exaggerated. However, the statement is welcome since it would make the trade unions uncomfortable. 

 It is unfortunate that the project to separate biodegradable waste is not being pursued in earnest. Even the NGOs do not seem to care much for the project. The civic body should also consider a scheme to generate energy from garbage. 

 C.R. Bhattacharjee,

 Lake Gardens.

 Calcutta Column

 I wish to inform people through this column how a reputed computer training institute like CMC can leave students in dire straits midway through a course. I was pursuing a course in Unix and programming at the Haldia centre of CMC. Suddenly, without any prior notice to me, the centre was closed down. My course was not even half finished when this happened, whereas I had paid my course fees in full prior to the course. Thereafter, I called up the CMC head office to know my fate but the staff didn?t seem bothered at all. 

 Arin Ghosh,

 Haldia. 

 Our authorised training centre (ATC) in Haldia closed down around 20 days ago. We then facilitated Arin to take the rest of his lessons at the Sealdah ATC as per his request. He has now even collected his course-completion certificate. CMC has 40 ATCs in West Bengal alone, each with an average of 300 students. The company has centres in five regions across the country with thousands of students enrolled in its various courses. As soon as we receive the course fee from any student, our business policy makes us duty-bound to complete the course taken up by him/her. Therefore, we have a provision that if an ATC closes down, the students of that centre can either complete the rest of the course at a nearby ATC or request for a refund of the entire course fee. Moreover, ATCs are not closed down abruptly. A notice of three months is given before a centre winds up. Hence, there is no reason for any student of ours to panic if an ATC shuts down. 

 S.K. Agarwal, 

 Head, education and training, CMC Ltd.

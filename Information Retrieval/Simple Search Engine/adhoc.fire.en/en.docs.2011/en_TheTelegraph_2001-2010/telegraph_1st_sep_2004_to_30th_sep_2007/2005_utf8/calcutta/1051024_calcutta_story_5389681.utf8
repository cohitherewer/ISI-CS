The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Billboard bar on the anvil

 FAIYAZ AHMED KHAN, mayoral council member (parks and gardens, and information and cultural affairs) met readers of The Telegraph to answer their queries. 

Participants included Dipu Das, Ranjan Ghosal, G. Laha, Jayanta Guha, Ejaz Ahmed, Tapan Adhikari, Shankar Ghosh, Sahiuddin Khan, Sandip Dasgupta, Mehboob Kader, 

A.K. Sinha, Barnali Ghatak and Sandip Banerjee

Barnali Ghatak: In the quest for funds, the civic authorities have allowed billboards to be put up everywhere in the city. They are spoiling the appearance of Calcutta. Is there a limit to the number of billboards that can put up in a particular place?

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya and the municipal commissioner are currently discussing the issue. We are planning to declare two or three areas in the city billboard-free zones. We also want to introduce a ceiling on the number of billboards that can be put up in a particular area.

A.K. Sinha: A temple is being erected on the pavement, 

under a tree, in front of 11, Harish Mukherjee Road. A tin-shed has already been 

put up and if the civic body does not act right now, the structure will become 

a permanent one. 

 I will look into the matter. I will also advise you to officially inform the police and provide me a copy of the complaint.

Sandip Dasgupta: The previous civic board had tried to rename Naktala Lane as Sailendra Nath Chaudhury Sarani. Though no official announcement was made, Trinamul leader Pankaj Banerjee announced the renaming at a function. Family members of Chaudhury are putting up boards on the lane with the new name.

 We will not tolerate this. Some individuals cannot change the name of a road by fixing boards. Proposals to rename a road must be forwarded to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) road-renaming committee for endorsement. The new name has to be ratified by the mayoral council in the monthly meeting of the civic House.

Dipu Das: About three decades after Independence, the Left Front had tried to make a contribution to the freedom struggle by banishing the statues of British personalities from Calcutta. Why are you then taking care of the Victoria Memorial Hall and the Town Hall?

 The decision to remove the statues was not taken by the CMC.

Tapan Adhikari: The former mayor had the capacity and courage to acquire land for parks. The CPM board hasn?t shown that kind of spirit...

 Besides having capacity and courage, we are also law abiding.

Shankar Ghosh: Subrata Mukherjee wanted to set up 100 new parks in the city. Do you have any such dream?

 We don?t believe in gimmick. We are always interested in setting up new parks. Provide us information about suitable vacant plots and we will turn them into parks.

Mehboob Kader: Who will maintain Citizens? Park?

 It is a white elephant left behind by Subrata Mukherjee for us. If it is to be maintained by the parks and gardens wing, all other parks in Calcutta will suffer. Annual maintenance cost of Citizens? Park has been calculated at over Rs 80 lakh. We are planning to entrust private agencies with the maintenance of the park. An entry fee will be collected to realise the cost.

Ranjan Ghosal: Trees like kolke, karabi, bakul and champa have already disappeared from the roadside in Calcutta proper. Why can?t you plant such trees in the city?

 If you are really interested, you can take saplings of these trees from us. We have already planted saplings in some of our parks. 

Ejaz Ahmed: Why does the CMC?s monthly magazine, Purasree, come out only in Bengali?

 I have a plan to bring out English and Urdu editions of Purasree.

Concluded

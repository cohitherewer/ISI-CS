The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Post-wave scurry to woo tourist

 SIMI KAMBOJ

 The time for counting losses seems to have ended. In a bid to tide over the tsunami effect, the travel industry is undertaking an exercise to popularise exotic Southeast Asian destinations among Calcuttans. 

 The Travel Agents Federation of India (TAFI) will hold a seminar on February 26 to showcase Southeast Asia among clients and travel agents. 

 Tour operators from Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore will attend the meet and explain to the participants how quickly their countries have recovered from the disaster. 

 To convince their audience, the representatives will show footage shot at the tourist locations, post-tsunami. 

 The Swabhumi meet will be attended by representatives from International Air Transport Association, TAFI, all major airlines operating from Southeast Asia and other segments of the travel industry.

 ?We want to tell prospective clients in the city that the destinations are no longer unsafe. The message to the agents will be: ?let?s get back to business?,? said Anil Punjabi, chairman (eastern India), TAFI. 

 To tide over the post-January lull, Thai Airways is contemplating a fare revision to attract more tourists.

 ?People are now apprehensive to travel to even safe destinations like Hong Kong and Singapore. Business continues to look low this season,? observed Krisna Pong, general manager (eastern India), Thai Airways. He confirmed having sent a proposal for fare revision on the Calcutta-Bangkok sector to the head office.

 Singapore Airlines, meanwhile, is concentrating on promoting more Southeast Asian destinations in Calcutta.

 ?Starting February, destinations such as Hong Kong and China will have a new fare structure. We feel these places have not been adequately promoted,? said Bharat Mahadevan, manager (eastern India), Singapore Airways.

 The tsunami had caused a loss of over Rs 5 crore in eastern India alone. Around 800 Calcuttans had cancelled their tickets to Southeast Asian spots in the wake of the tsunami, while a few hundred more postponed their trips. 

 Southeast Asian countries like Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Indonesia together account for 65 per cent of eastern India?s international travel market.

 ?The biggest travel season, New Year, was washed out by the tsunami. Now that schools have reopened, most people will not be inclined to make a trip. So, our focus will be on honeymooners,? said Punjabi.

 Unrest shadow at admission door

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The student unrest at Jadavpur University (JU), a national centre of excellence, has sparked serious concern. 

 It has even spurred the central selection committee of the state joint entrance examinations (JEE) board to meet on Tuesday evening and discuss how to address inquiries from students and guardians about the present situation on the JU campus. 

 The committee will start allotment of seats to the state?s engineering institutions on the basis of the order of merit of students in JEE 2005 from Wednesday.

 ?It?s going to be an embarrassing situation if students and parents question us on the current deadlock in JU. We have never faced such a crisis before,? a senior officer of the JEE central selection committee said after the meeting.

 The counselling of the general category of students seeking admission to the engineering courses will begin on June 22. 

 The physically-challenged and scheduled caste and scheduled tribe categories will be counselled on Wednesday.

 Sources close to the state technical education department said central selection committee officers in charge of counselling have been advised to ensure that not a single high-performing student, who deserves a seat in Jadavpur University, strays to a lesser-known college only because of the trouble on the campus

 They have been asked to explain to students and guardians attending the counselling that the present situation was brought on by an administrative problem. 

 ?As of now, no student or guardian has approached us with queries on the developments at JU,? said Manoj Mitra, dean of the faculty of engineering and technology. 

 ?As far as the university?s academic excellence is concerned, it has reached a stature which few institutions in the entire country have been able to achieve. One must understand that the present movement does not make the university?s academic excellence questionable in any way,? he added. 

 With Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s government finding no solution to end the nearly two-month-old students? movement on the Jadavpur campus, the institution may lose high performing admission-seekers in the current academic session.

 The prolonged disruption in academic activities ? examination and class-boycott programmes ? is compelling many top rankers on the JEE merit list and also high performers in Higher Secondary, ISC and CBSE to give a second thought on whether or not they should seek a berth in the bachelor?s degree courses of the university.

 ?Few students get a chance to study an engineering course in Jadavpur University. But now that there seems to be no end to the trouble, I may think twice about joining this institution if I am allotted a seat there,? said a student who holds a rank among the first 100 on the JEE merit list.

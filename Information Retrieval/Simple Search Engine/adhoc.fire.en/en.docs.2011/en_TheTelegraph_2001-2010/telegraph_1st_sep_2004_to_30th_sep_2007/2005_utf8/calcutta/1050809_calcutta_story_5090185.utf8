 Assault sparks shanty ransack

 - Truck driver, help beat up women

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Tension gripped the West Port police station area on Monday morning after a woman, who lives in a slum, was allegedly assaulted by a truck driver and his help. Local residents caught hold of the two and beat them up.

 Truck owners, drivers and workers retaliated by ransacking several shanties and blocking roads. As both sides lodged police complaints, the women and the ?assaulters? have been arrested.

 The incident occurred around 9 am near Nimakmal Hospital, a stone?s throw from West Port police station.

 Trouble broke out when Mithilesh Kewar, the truck driver, was parking his vehicle in front of the house of Mohammed Manoj. Ajmeri Khatun, Manoj?s wife, was then preparing for the christening ceremony of their five-day-old son.

 Ajmeri alleged that she requested Kewar to park the truck elsewhere, but he refused. As an altercation ensued, Kewar and his help, Mahendra Paswan, assaulted the woman. Her screams alerted neighbours, who came to her rescue and thrashed both Kewar and Paswan.

 A little later, a 100-strong group of truck drivers, work ers and members of the Kidderpore-Bhutghat Truck Owners? Association gathered on the spot and ransacked eight shanties, including Ajmeri?s.

 The association members also blocked the crossing of Nimakmal Road and Circular Garden Reach Road for more than an hour.

 ?Today was the sixth day of my child and we were preparing for chhatti, the christening ceremony. The driver parked his truck near my shanty and we protested. But the driver and his help got down and started beating me up. They kicked and punched me. I slumped to the ground unconscious, the baby in my arms. Afterwards, a mob gathered and demolished my home,? Ajmeri said at the police station.

 The truck-owners? association, however, denied the allegations. ?Both Kewar and Paswan were innocent. They were the ones who were beaten up and are in need of treatment. We blocked roads to protest the police action. The cops are not even listening to the local MLA,? said Izhar Amed, a member of the truck-owners? association.

 The MLA, Ram Pyare Ram, who visited the police station, came out in support of the truck drivers and owners.

 Deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) Anuj Sharma said: ?Around 100 members of the association set up a blockade at the crossing of Nimakmal Road and Circular Garden Reach Road. The issue was parking of vehicles on Nimakmal Road.?

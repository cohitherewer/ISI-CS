 Playing with colours

 A visualiser of advertising art and an excellent illustrator, Shyamal Sen?s prolonged experience in visual creativity has helped him achieve distinction as a master watercolour artist. His recent creations, on display at Macrocosm, the ongoing exhibition of his watercolours, have the same maturity, spontaneity and unity of design, rhythm and composition that have distinguished his works in applied art. The collection on show is inspired by the vivacity of nature and the richness of the surrounding world. With each stroke of his brush, Sen has recreated the pristine beauty of a group of Santhals, the exuberance of a dense forest, the magnificence of snow-capped mountain peaks, the unbridled force of a tsunami, the grace of a classical dancer, or the serenity of a moonlit night; in vivid, brilliant tones that bring to life the scenes portrayed by him. Versatile in technique, with fluid and controlled use of colours, his landscapes prove beyond doubt that watercolours are his forte.

 Event: An exhibition of watercolours by Shyamal Sen

 When: Till November 11, 3 pm - 8 pm

 Where: Academy of Fine Arts, Central Gallery

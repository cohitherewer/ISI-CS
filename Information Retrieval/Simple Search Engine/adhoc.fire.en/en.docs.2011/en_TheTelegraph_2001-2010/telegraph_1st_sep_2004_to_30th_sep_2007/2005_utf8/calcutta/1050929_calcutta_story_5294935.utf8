 Ciao Bella, a design studio on 3, Queens Park, is exhibiting its festive collection till October 3. Inaugurated by actress June earlier this week, the event showcases ethnic as well as western womens wear for the season.

 The traditional fare includes saris, lehngas, kurtas and salwar suits, while in western wear there are shirts, kurtis, skirts, formal jackets and trousers.

 Saris in crepes, georgettes and chiffons worked with sequins and stones glitter in chandelier-like patterns. Elaborate zardosi work adorn the more ornate ones. The colours are a mix of bright red, blue, fuschia, yellow and subdued pink, cream and peach. The palette of this collection highlights the lights and colours of the Pujas, says designer Madhu Khaitan.

 The lehngas are light swirling ones, teamed with beautifully-embellished churnis. The simple yet striking designs are also suitable for wedding functions. Salwar suits and kurtas are adorned with appliques, patchwork and stones. To match the garments, there are accessories like jewellery and bags. The silver ornaments are studded with semi-precious stones. The bags come as potlis as well as clutches.

 Prices start at Rs 3,000 for the saris and go up to Rs 15,000. The kurtas are priced between Rs 1,800 and Rs 7,000, while the western wear ranges from Rs 500 to Rs 2,500.

 Apart from saris, there are salwar suits, tops and kurtas in cotton, worked with Kashmiri and Gujarati stitches. For men, there are punjabis with the same kind of embroidery.

 The price point is rather low, to suit the target local clientele. Taant saris start at Rs 350 and go up to a few thousand, while the rest of the stuff is priced Rs 300 onwards.

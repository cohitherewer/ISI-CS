 After taxis, buses to ply on the river

 The proposed water bus that will ply on the Hooghly

 In an attempt to reduce the load on Calcutta roads, the transport department is set to introduce water buses on the Hooghly. The city-based Pailan group will be the West Bengal Surface Transport Corporation (WBSTC)?s partner in the joint-venture project. An MoU has been signed in this regard earlier in the month.

 Pailan will meet the investment and operational costs, while the WBSTC will provide administrative help and look after the infrastructure, including jetties, booking counters and the passenger dispersal system. The group will also pay an annual licence fee and a percentage of the profit to the corporation.

 Four specially-designed vessels will be used to launch the service. Each will have a seating capacity of 60 and a small deck. The vessels will ply on both short and long routes. During office hours, they will travel between Prinsep Ghat/Millennium Park and the suburbs of North and South 24-Parganas, Howrah and Hooghly.

 On the long routes, the vessels will ply between Calcutta and Haldia, Diamond Harbour, Mayapur and Bandel. The fares, to range from Rs 10 to Rs 100, will be finalised after the routes are fixed.

 Managing director of WBSTC Asit Mondal said the water buses would provide a comfortable and eco-friendly journey. ?Currently, launches are used only to cross the river, and thousands from both sides avail of the services. After water buses are introduced, commuters can avoid roads altogether.?

 Chairman and managing director of the Pailan group Apurba Saha said the vessels were almost ready and a trial run would be conducted in a month. ?Unlike the existing vessels, ours will be made of fibre and will cruise at a high speed. We will initially invest Rs 3 crore. A cargo service is also on the anvil,? he added.

 A transport department officer said: ?Most roads remain choked with vehicles. As there is little scope of increasing speed, we are looking at alternative modes of transport.?

 A company named Vivada has rolled out a water taxi service on the Hooghly. Trial runs were successfully conducted last week. ?After the water bus service is launched, we will focus on water tourism,? said the WBSTC managing director.

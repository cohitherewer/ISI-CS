The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Meter 

Metro Movie Meter

Iqbal (Shreyas Talpade), an 18-year-old deaf and 

mute village boy, wants to make it to the Indian cricket team. Dampened by power 

play, he finds support from his family and village drunkard Mohit (Naseeruddin 

Shah).

Brilliantly penned, the script balances the languid pace of village life and the 

speed of fast bowling. 

Extracting great performances from his largely unknown cast ? Shreyas Talpade, 

Yateen Karyekar, Pratiksha Lonkar, Shweta Prasad ? Kukunoor makes the linear storyline 

engrossing and believable.

Veterans Naseeruddin Shah and Girish Karnad make the characters their own. Watch 

out for the confrontation sequence. 

The camerawork by Sudeep Chatterjee is a visual treat, using different shades 

of green to underline the different sequences. 

Salim-Sulaiman?s background score becomes Iqbal?s voice and the couple 

of songs effectively contribute to the scheme of things.

First weekend watch: 75 % at INOX 

(Forum), 60 % at INOX (City Centre), 45 % at 89 Cinemas (Swabhumi)

Last word: Give Team India a break 

? root for Iqbal Khan rather than Zaheer Khan, and you wouldn?t mind an action 

replay!

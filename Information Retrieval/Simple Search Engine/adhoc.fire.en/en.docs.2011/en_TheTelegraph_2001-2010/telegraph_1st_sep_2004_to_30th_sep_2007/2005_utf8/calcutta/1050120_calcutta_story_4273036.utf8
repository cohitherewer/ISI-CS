 Ph.D pay check scurry on campus

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta University (CU) on Wednesday started verifying the pay-scales of at least 100 senior teachers to find out whether they have been drawing emoluments in excess of what is due to them.

 CU is probing whether the teachers had made any false claim, on the basis of which they had been granted two special increments. 

 At the root of the exercise is a University Grants Commission (UGC) circular stating that all university teachers who have obtained a Ph.D degree while in service will be entitled to the special increments.

 The university?s decision has sparked a controversy. While the authorities are uncertain whether the teachers under scanner were actually eligible for the increments, the CPM-controlled Calcutta University Teachers? Association claims none of the teachers had wangled any undue benefit.

 ?We have just begun the process of checking the pay-scales. I cannot draw a conclusion unless the exercise is complete,? said T.K. Mukherjee, pro vice-chancellor (finance). 

 Following the UGC circular, more than 100 teachers, mostly professors, had claimed that they had done their Ph.D while in service and were eligible for the benefit.

 The university?s finance committee granted the increments, which resulted in higher scales for the teachers.

 But soon after, the university was informed by the government (the principal source of funds) that the circular was meant for those who had met certain other criteria, apart from completing Ph.D in the course of service.

 What added fuel to the debate was a finding of the university?s internal audit: several of the teachers under scanner had already availed of the benefits of obtaining a Ph.D degree by being promoted to higher posts, such as reader and professor.

 The teachers? association, however, rejected the government?s stand and threatened to launch an agitation if any of its members were deprived of the benefits without a valid reason.

 ?It is unfair to raise a debate on the issue at this stage,? said Sankhayan Choudhury, teacher association general secretary.

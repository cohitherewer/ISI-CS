The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bench takes on case after fair trial plea

 - ABDUCTED BY COPS, CRY KIN

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court on Tuesday stayed proceedings of the Partha Majumdar disappearance case in the Barasat court of the additional district and sessions judge, North 24-Parganas, and decided to hear it on March 11. 

 The order followed a petition by Majumdar?s brother Dipankar, alleging that even after a directive from the high court, the state government did not take any step to ensure a fair trial.

 Earlier, on February 18, a division bench of the high court had directed state chief secretary Ashok Gupta to ensure a fair trial of the case.

 The West Bengal Human Rights Commission had held 11 policemen responsible for Majumdar?s abduction. The court had also asked the state to change the public prosecutor of the trial.

 Majumdars? counsel Sadhan Roy Chowdhury on Tuesday informed the division bench, comprising acting Chief Justice Ashok Ganguly and Justice Tapan Kumar Dutt, that the public prosecutor of the trial had not been changed yet.

 ?The public prosecutor is still threatening my client inside the court during trial,? Roy Chowdhury alleged. Advocate-general Balai Ray, who was present in the court during the last hearing, was not present on Tuesday.

 Appearing on behalf of the state, Tarun Roy, advocate-general of Tripura, told the court that he would ask the government to carry out the court?s order.

 Acting Chief Justice Ganguly, however, asked: ?Why haven?t the accused police officers been arrested yet? How were the accused granted bail??

 The court also asked the government counsel why the earlier order of the bench hadn?t been carried out by the state.

 Partha Majumdar, 30, a resident of Nandan Nagar, under Belghoria police station jurisdiction, on the northern fringes of the city, was allegedly abducted by police on September 5, 1997, from a tea-stall near his house.

 According to Nandan Nagar residents and neighbours, Majumdar had witnessed the killing of a criminal during an encounter with the police. 

 Majumdar?s mother Sunila and his elder brother Dipankar tried to locate him in all the police stations of the district, but failed.

 Sunila then wrote several letters to government departments, but without evincing any response. She then moved the high court, seeking its intervention in the matter. 

 A division bench of the court passed a directive on January 21, 1998, asking the human rights commission to probe the matter and file a report.

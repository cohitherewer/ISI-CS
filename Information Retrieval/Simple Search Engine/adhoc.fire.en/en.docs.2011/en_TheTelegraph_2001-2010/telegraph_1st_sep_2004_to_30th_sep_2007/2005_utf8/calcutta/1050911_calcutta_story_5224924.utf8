 Raise one for the ribald

 Ph.D has lost all academic pretensions and answers to the call of Poor Horny Divas. Wanakam is just a south Indian way of saying, ?Wanna cum?? A feminist shedding her clothes, not her ideology, to pose for Playboy...

 The Friday evening cocktail theatre Beauty, Brains amp; Personality at The Park was certainly not meant to be heard by the family (thanks to innuendoes galore) or watched by the weak-hearted (thanks to Kashmera Shah?s plunging neckline). 

 But three drinks down and one in hand, nearly every joke ? corny or horny ? went down well with the packed banquet crowd. So what if the laughter and the applause were often ill-timed. 

 Adapted from an American play by Emmett Loverde, producer-director Vandana Sajnani?s Beauty? looks at the insecurities of women through incoherent ramblings by three friends, Sara, Tanya and Pia. 

 Sara (Kashmera) considers herself the ultimate beauty even if she doesn?t know what work she does in office, can?t distinguish between disparate and desperate, and is absolutely obsessed with make-up and men. ?I don?t know what to say if I enter a room without men,? she frowns.

 Pia (Tejaswini Kollhapure) is the feminist who has nothing to do with men and is neck-deep in her dissertation. But she doesn?t mind chatting up a male photographer friend every now and then. ?I have heard that if you don?t have sex for two years, you get re-virginised,? she announces to the audience, in all seriousness.

 Tanya (Vandana) is ?cutesy? as opposed to the sexy Sara, as she gorges on strawberry pistachio without worrying about her weight. She believes she cannot ?get a man? and so resorts to a sperm bank for her dream to mother a child. ?You think I am pretty because you are good to me,? she keeps telling her friends.

 The 110 minutes of the two-act production was what lost opportunities are made of, as the second act, meant to take a serious turn after Tanya gets impregnated, continued to depend on inane lines and tacky SMS jokes. Meant to ?generate pathos? and ?pass on a sweet message? at the end, Beauty... could never lift itself out of the belly-laughter hole it had dug for itself.

 With Kashmera prancing around on stage in clothes that would make the Rakhi Sawants and Mumait Khans blush, parts of the play turned out to be nothing more than a catch-the-cleavage contest. 

 Tejaswini was a revelation, though, loveable as the bespectacled bookworm and equally adorable as the ravishing calendar girl, post-interval. 

 Vandana was good in patches but was largely over-shadowed by the loud Kashmera and the lithe Tejaswini.

 Before taking the stage, Vandana had highlighted how her play was just a chat between friends and how they never took the rehearsals very seriously. Unfortunately, they didn?t even take the audiences too seriously, who went on a wine-tasting binge.

 Beauty, brains or personality? Hic!

 Band on screen beat

You have enjoyed their music on your car radios. You have swung to their beats in live concerts. You have even hummed their songs in ad jingles. Now get ready to welcome Bhoomi into your drawing room as the popular Bengali band hosts a weekly musical show on TV.

 ?We have always tried to give back through our music whatever we have received from our listeners,? says lead vocalist Surajit Chatterjee. ?Through this television show, too, we are trying to address all those areas that we usually tend to forget, like talented children and forgotten artistes.?

 So the new show, to go on air in end-October on ETV Bangla, will have performances by children ?in a non-competitive set-up? and feature veterans like Ram Kumar Chattopadhyay, Nirmala Misra and Brojen Biswas alongside contemporary artistes like Haimanti Shukla, Bratati Bandopadhyay, and Sriradha Bandopadhyay. Popular telly actors like Paran Bandopadhyay and Kharaj Mukherjee will also appear on the show.

 What makes the half-hour Sunday show special is the way Bhoomi and its music have been incorporated in the format. While the show has been called Baranday Roddur, after the band?s most popular song, the different sections of the programme have been named after other Bhoomi tracks. So you have Dushtu Haowa, a platform for children, Chokhar Desh, where the weekly guest makes an appearance, and Chhutchhe Jibon, a musical contest for the audience. But the clincher will definitely be Kande Shudhu Mon, where Bhoomi sings and shares special nuggets of its live shows.

 ?In an age where everything on television is about reality contests and talent hunts, we wanted people and especially children to perform without any pressure to deliver. That is what sets Baranday Roddur apart,? adds Surajit.

 The sets create an impression of the pan-Bangla listenership that Bhoomi enjoys. What?s more, you have actors (of Atmik theatre group) dressed as characters from Bhoomi numbers like Photik, Pocha Kaka and Bhole Baba to interact with the audience.

 From the small screen to the big screen. Bhoomi is scoring the music for Teen Yaari Katha, a feature film directed by Sudeshna Roy and Abhijit Guha. ?We found the story to be fresh and the treatment fresher,? is the band?s reason for composing the background music and two tracks.

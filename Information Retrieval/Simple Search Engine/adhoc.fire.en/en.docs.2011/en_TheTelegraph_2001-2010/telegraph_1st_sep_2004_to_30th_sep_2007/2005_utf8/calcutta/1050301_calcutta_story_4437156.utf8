 Service tax grumble in club circuit

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Be prepared to fork out more for that beer or bake at your favourite leisure rendezvous soon. Clubbing together, that passionate pursuit of Calcuttans, is all set to get dearer, post-Budget.

 With Union finance minister P. Chidambaram slapping a 10.2 per cent service tax on membership fees of clubs and associations, city clubs are struggling to figure out the logic of the levy and bracing for the blow that must be passed on to the members.

 ?We are rendering a service to ourselves and we will have to pay a tax for it from now on. That means the government is not accepting the mutuality theory,? observes Tollygunge Club president Goutam Chakravartti.

 Conventional clubs have always been kept out of the tax dragnet on the premise that members own the clubs and, hence, can?t tax themselves for services rendered. 

 Calcutta Club president Bhaskar Sen, a lawyer, feels a club is a conglomerate of people and it belongs to them. ?It would be akin to paying taxes for the food you consume at home. After all, we are not a profit-making entity.?

 For privately-owned clubs running on a commercially viable corporate model, the new levy is sure to pinch members? pockets. Says M.J. Robertson, CEO of Space Circle: ?We have been paying service taxes on a few isolated items, like hall charges for banqueting. But a blanket taxation is a fresh blow and will raise running usage costs.?

 For Spring Club, set to open its EM Bypass doors later this year, the Budget blow could hurt most while processing applications for enrolment. ?The taxation initiative is likely to have a short-term impact and quite naturally, the burden has to be passed on to the consumer,? says Piyush Bhagat, developing Silver Spring, which houses Spring Club. This burden, for the new member, is expected to be upwards of Rs 20,000, with entry pegged at Rs 2 lakh.

 Not everyone is buckling under the service tax load, though. ?If you are into leisure activities, it implies you have a disposable income and you should be prepared to pay your taxes,? stresses DI president Derek O?Brien. The Jhowtala Road club, however, is advancing its enrolment of 200 members from April to March to save them the tax blow on entry.

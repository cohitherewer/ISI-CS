 Flower power for wedding wonders

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 According to Feng Shui, a pair of flowers floating in fresh water, a pair of bamboo shoots tied with red ribbon or a picture of two buds or flowers placed in one rsquo;s personal wedding direction enhances marriage luck

Q: What are my daughters chances of marriage according to Chinese astrology? When is it likely to happen? Her date of birth is 17.01.81 at 9 am. I cannot activate the south-west side of her bedroom as the doorway is there. What else can we do?

 The Solution: Earth and metal elements rule her life. She is a weak wood person, so the possibility of her marriage is very bright as metal is in power this year, which represents a change in residence for her. Keep metal decorative objects on her bedside table to give a further boost to this element. If the doorway falls in the south-west, the next best option is her personal marriage direction, which is east. A pair of flowers floating in fresh water, a pair of bamboo shoots tied with red ribbon or a picture that has two buds or flowers in it will strengthen her marriage Chi.

 Q: Last year I bought a new house, and my office is on the first floor just above the garage. I am not doing very well in my business and am wondering whether the empty parking space has anything to do with it. My residence is on the second floor. Could you give me some remedies to improve my business?

 The Solution: Your office is located above a void, which is considered inauspicious in Feng Shui. To do well in business, you will have to strengthen the earth energy, which is known for its gravitational pull and hence gives stability and grounding. To tap the earth Chi, fill the void and strengthen the base by keeping heavy boulders or a earthen sculpture in the south-west of the garage. Along with this, you can hang a picture of mountains with soft curved peaks on the south-west wall of your chamber to give additional boost to your business.

 Q: For many years, we have been sleeping with our heads pointing north. Our health was perfect all these years but recently we have been developing some minor ailments. We were warned against this, but we never cared as we were in good health. Moving the bed from the present position would be difficult. Please suggest a remedy.

 R.K.

 The Solution: Many people feel uncomfortable while sleeping with their heads towards the north because the head is considered the north pole of the body. When one sleeps with the head pointing to the earths magnetic north pole, the two similar poles repel and interfere with sleeping patterns. Lying with the head pointing south, the two opposite poles attract, resulting in a more sound sleep. Your physical ailments could be a natural side-effect of ageing, but if it is playing on your mind and you dont want to sleep in the same position anymore, the best solution would be to turn your body around and put your pillow in the south. 

 Q: Our large joint family has separated and we have temporarily moved into a rented flat till we find a new house to move in to. The rooms in the flat are all irregular in shape with more or less than four walls. Each room has either a projection jutting out or a corner missing. It is extremely difficult to do the interiors of this place. Please help.

 Radhika

 The Solution: Irregular shaped rooms with more or less than four walls are considered unbalanced and inauspicious as the Chi does not flow smoothly and comfortably, disturbing the occupant physically and mentally. You must balance the missing corners with large mirrors that will help create an illusion of space and depth. But do not use them in bedroom to correct the flaws. Instead, use furniture in the form of tall cabinets, low height runners or soft curtains to camouflage irregular shaped bedrooms. Fresh green plants along with lamps and artifacts are excellent to fill and soften projected nooks and corners and, at the same time, help the cosmic energy flow smoothly.

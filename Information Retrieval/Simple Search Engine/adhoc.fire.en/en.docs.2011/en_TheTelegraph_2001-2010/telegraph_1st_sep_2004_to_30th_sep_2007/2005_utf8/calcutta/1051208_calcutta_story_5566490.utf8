The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cop caution over cell phone thefts

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 If you love your cell phone, then don?t let it out of sight ? that?s the advice of Calcutta Police to Metro Rail commuters. 

 According to the cops, even putting the cell phone in the pocket during a Metro ride is fraught with danger. They feel holding the handset in the palm is the best strategy.

 The warning from police follows increased number of cell phone thefts underground, especially during the office rush. A gang is believed to be at work, and those who love flaunting their phone are their favourite targets.

 The stations where the most number of cell phone thefts has occurred in the past few months are Sovabazar, Esplanade, Chandni Chowk, Park Street and Bhowanipore. In most cases, the sets were lifted while the people were getting off the train or standing in a crowded compartment.

 ?The gang members scan the train for people who have kept their costly sets in their shirt or trouser pockets and are unmindful. The lifters generally strike when the passengers are busy getting off the train,? said a senior officer of the detective department.

 On a few instances, the victims soon realised their phone had been picked, but could do little as the train had by then left the platform, the officer added. Cell phones have also been lifted while the victims were walking out of the station. The last few incidents have been reported at the Park Street station.

 About seven or eight handsets are stolen from Metro stations every month, said cops. Investigations have revealed that a group of men in their 20s are behind the thefts. They take the Metro Rail every day in search of soft targets.

 The youths hail from Ghutiarishariff and Metiabruz, and dress smartly. They do not have fixed takers for the stolen sets. A relatively new handset fetches between Rs 500 and Rs 700.

 To catch the lifters, the detective department has decided to deploy sleuths in plainclothes at some Metro stations. Some of the gang members had been arrested earlier, but are out on bail.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Father prays at hell?s end

 - Contradictory statements on NRI groom?s marriage plans

 A STAFF REPORTER

 As word reached him that the Amritsar Mail had rolled into platform no. 12 of Howrah station, carrying his ?missing? son from Mughalsarai, Saroj Bhattacharya, Rajiv?s father sent up a quick prayer, standing outside his Salt Lake home on Sunday. London-based IBM global executive Rajiv had disappeared on June 1.

 ?We went through hell for the past few days,? said Bhattacharya. Rajiv was finally spotted at Mughalsarai railway station on June 3, a day before his marriage.

 Family members passed a tense Saturday night, waiting for the Amritsar Mail to reach Howrah station. Around 8.30 am, Bhattacharya learnt that the train had arrived. He called up family members accompanying Rajiv on their mobile phones. Soon, Rajiv was taken to Calcutta Medical Research Institute.

 ?My son has lived in London for long, and finds the heat here a problem. This is one reason why he looks so devastated,? Bhattacharya said.

 Relatives continued to visit the Bhattacharya residence on Sunday, too. The pandal erected for the marriage has been dismantled. The wedding gifts packed on June 1, before being sent to the bride?s house at Purbachal, in Salt Lake, were lying in one corner. 

 The family maintained that Rajiv had been kidnapped. ?We feel he was abducted. We are not ruling out the hand of some rival computer multinational in this,? Rajiv?s father said. 

 According to him, Rajiv, who is scheduled to return to London from Calcutta on June 13, will sign a deal with another company on IBM?s behalf in Manchester on return.

 At 10 am, a taxi was called and Bhattacharya and his wife Maya left to visit their son in hospital. 

 ?Rajiv broke into tears as soon as he saw his parents,? said Partha Banerjee, Rajiv?s brother-in-law. He showed them the wounds inflicted on his body. ?He is still unwell but his condition is improving,? said Banerjee. 

 However, the family members made contradictory statements about the future of the marriage. ?My son told me that there is no question of the marriage taking place now,? said Bhattacharya in the morning. ?We will speak to the girl?s family once the crisis is over,? he added.

 But Banerjee said in the evening that Rajiv himself had expressed his willingness to marry. ?He said he is keen to marry and we are planning to arrange the ceremony while he is here,? Banerjee signed off.

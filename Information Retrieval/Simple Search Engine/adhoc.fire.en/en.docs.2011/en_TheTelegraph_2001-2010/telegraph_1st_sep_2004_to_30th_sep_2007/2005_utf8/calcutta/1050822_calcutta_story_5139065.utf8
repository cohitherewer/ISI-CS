The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Pendulum swings for the sepoy

 - Phenomenal start took a dip on city screens, but it?s Rising again for Aamir Khan comeback vehicle

 JUST A LULL: Aamir Khan in a moment from Mangal Pandey ? The Rising

 Bang, bang. Block, block. Bang, bang?

 Mangal Pandey?s attack at the box-office has been very much a vintage Ganguly one-day knock ? the blazing start, the smothered middle overs and then back to the electric ways. Thanks to the unprecedented buzz, the Ketan Mehta historical, heralding the return of Aamir Khan after four years, took off brilliantly but fell with a thud Tuesday onwards.

 The multiplex occupancy charts say it all ? an average of 90 per cent in the first four days (including Independence Day Monday) and then the big drop to around 60 per cent in the next three days (Tuesday to Thursday). Rakhi Friday, though, saw another turnaround, as Mangal Pandey recovered substantially to register healthy percentages, much higher than the two new releases, My Wife?s Murder and Barsaat.

 Says 89 Cinemas general manager Prashant Srivastava: ?Poor competition from the new films and reduced pricing has again got people queuing up for Mangal Pandey. But the negative word-of-mouth publicity is spreading fast and it?s the huge expectations that?s killing the movie.?

 Fictionalising incidents aplenty to magnify the contribution of India?s first martyr, Mangal Pandey ? The Rising has met with mixed reactions. While some audiences found the film?s ?overriding sentiment relevant to today?s world politics?, for many it was ?distortion of history? under the glorious garb of cinema. No wonder the film had to take a pit stop after the spectacular opening weekend. 

 ?There has to be a slump when you have such a phenomenal start,? producer Bobby Bedi tells Metro. ?But not only are the distributors and exhibitors making money, TV channels and book writers are making the most of the buzz. Even criticising Mangal Pandey has become a franchise.?

 While the city collections have swung to and fro, the occupancy in the districts and suburbs has been rock steady. Says eastern region distributor, Pritam Jalan: ?Halls like Payel in Siliguri and Jyoti in Chandernagore have been doing great business right through. So have the theatres of Lake Town and Baranagar. The drop was only at the city screens in the middle before the rise again in the second weekend.? 

 The second box-office rising of Mangal Pandey will mean added revenue for producer Bedi, who admitted to making profits even before the Rs 40-crore magnum opus hit theatres on August 12. ?Distribution rights in the country and overseas, music rights, satellite rights and brand tie-ups have ensured that the production money is recovered before the audiences and critics can pass judgment on the film,? reveals a Bollywood trade analyst.

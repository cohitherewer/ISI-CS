The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Saris or salwars, but no lipstick for teachers

 - Quartet refuses to bow to school dress-down diktat

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Wipe your lips and eyes clean before you enter your class, or stop teaching ? the management?s New Year greeting to women teachers at a north Calcutta school.

 The circular, effective January 1, debars teachers of Bonhooghly Girls? High School in Baranagar from wearing lipstick, kajal, bindi, danglers or eye-catching clothes and carrying mobile phones to class.

 ?Ours is not one of those elite English-medium schools attended by students from affluent families. We have students coming mostly from low-income group families. Here, we don?t want to see teachers going to class in deep shades of lipstick, dangling ear-rings and mobile phones,? said headmistress Tapati Dutta.

 Four young teachers at the all-girls? school ? Madhumita Khan, Shampa Saha, Sanchita Adhikary and Asima Adhikary ? have decided not to obey the dress-down diktat.

 ?This is a fatwa we are not going to accept under any circumstance. All of us are qualified to be teachers and have joined the profession after clearing state-level competitive exams conducted by the government. We are aware of how to present ourselves before our students,? said one of the ?rebel? teachers.

 ?We are not going to accept this high-handed attitude because one?s teaching abilities do not depend on lipstick or kajal,? said another.

 The incident has put the state government in a spot. 

 ?We wonder how the authorities of Bonhooghly School could issue such a circular. There is no government rule that can debar a teacher from wearing lipstick or kajal to the classroom,? admitted a senior official of the state education department.

 A few months ago, responding to orders from Calcutta High Court and the state human rights commission, the government had issued circulars to all state-aided institutions asking them not to debar any teacher from wearing salwar-kameez to school.

 Till this order was issued, most schools would follow a conventional dress code for women teachers ? saris only, please. Protesting the unwritten dress code, a section of women teachers had approached the court.

 Bonhooghly Girls? High School has added a twist in this sartorial tale, too.

 ?You must stick to one kind of dress ? either saris or salwar-kameez,? the order points out. ?Teachers cannot switch from one kind of dress to another? This sends a wrong signal to students.?

 The school management had issued the circular on December 18 and apparently noticed four out of the total 10 teachers not toeing the line.

 To ensure the ban was implemented from January 1, headmistress Dutta decided to boycott the morning prayers till all teachers signed the circular.

 When this did not work, Dutta debarred the four teachers from taking classes.

 Dutta alleged that the stern measure was taken following a series of complaints from some students against the quartet. 

 The students, she claimed, had objected to the manner in which the teachers would chat about ?fashion and lifestyle? in class and also spend a long time on their cell phones.

 The school?s managing committee is backing the headmistress. 

 ?We do not want our teachers coming to school wearing lipstick and kajal. We will take necessary action against the four teachers,? said school committee chairman Bijoy Krishna Roy.

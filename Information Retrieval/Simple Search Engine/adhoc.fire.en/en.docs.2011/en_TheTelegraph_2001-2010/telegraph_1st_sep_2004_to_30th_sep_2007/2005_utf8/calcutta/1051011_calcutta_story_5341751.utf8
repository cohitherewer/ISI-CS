 So you are firmly in the Puja groove, having pandal-hopped the whole of Sashthi and attended several adda sessions at Maddox Square and at your para pandal through Saptami... Now, you are all set to make the most of the remaining two days before the festive frenzy fizzles out.

 After two days of revelry, Ashtami is the time to get a little more religious as you head for your para puja early in the morning to offer anjali. And like every year, as you perform this annual ritual with renewed vigour, you would probably like to be at your traditional best, all decked up in ethnic finery.

 Goodlife has got designers Monapali and Sharbari Dutta to unleash their creativity and dress up models Bidita and Michael in Ashtami attire. Make-up artiste Aniruddha Chakladar creates the look of the day.

 Her

 Ashtami is the day for saris. I cant imagine Bengali women offering anjali in anything but a sari. And the red-and-white combination has a charm of its own that goes very well with the spirit of the day, says designer Pali Sachdev.

 She has draped Bidita in a specially-designed sari that draws inspiration from Durga. The body is made of white net organza from Benaras with white velvet flowers woven on it.

 The border and the pallu in a combination of red, orange and fuschia are embellished with Puja motifs like the face of the goddess, the ghat, the swastika symbol and the Om in zardosi.

 To give the traditional look a stylish twist, the designer has accessorised it with a bunch of Rajasthani white ivory churas that highlight the white of the sari.

 The sari is very versatile. One can wear it for the anjali in the morning and also to a party in the evening where it can be teamed with pearl jewellery. In fact, it will offer a very different and much dressy look when accessorised with diamonds and rubies, adds Pali.

 The make-up draws from the hues of the sari. I have done up Biditas eyes with a combination of fuschia, pink, orange and gold shadows, kohl on the upper and lower rims and lots of mascara. The dark eyes reflect the Ashtami magic, says Aniruddha.

 Soft pink blush-on and fuschia lips with gold highlight complete the look. A big brown bindi motif adorns her forehead.

 I have kept the make-up a little gorgeous because the dressy look goes with the sari. Its also ideal for an Ashtami evening do, adds Aniruddha.

 Him

 The dhotikurta look has somehow become synonymous with mens dressing on Ashtami, so I decided to break this code and be a little experimental. Men are very adventurous in their dressing now and I think they can afford to be a little exotic during Puja, says Sharbari.

 She has dressed up Michael in a bright red matka silk kurti with threadwork and stones, teamed with a pair of black trousers. A flaming orange sarong drape with multi-coloured embroidery is tied over the trousers.

 The sarong is the key item of the whole look. This lends an exotic feel to the attire. And whats more, its a versatile garment that can be used as a stole with a traditional kurta and pyjama, adds the designer.

 While the kurti and the trouser without the drape will offer a festive but casual feel in the morning, the sarong tied over the lowers will change the entire look to a dressier one apt for the evening.

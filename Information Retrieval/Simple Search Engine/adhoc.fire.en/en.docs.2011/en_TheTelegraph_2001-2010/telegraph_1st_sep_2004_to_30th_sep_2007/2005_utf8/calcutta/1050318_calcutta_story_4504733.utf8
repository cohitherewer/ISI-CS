 Design and decoration

 Dressing up home interiors has always been a passion with Paromita Sircar. Excelling in creating a variety of finely designed art objects for the home, her works of art also pay rich tributes to Indian culture and heritage. The ongoing exhibition of her paintings, marble works and fibre artifacts represents an expression of her desire to carry forward traditional and ethnic art forms in contemporary works of art. On show is a collection of exotic Tanjore paintings embellished with intricate ornamental relief work, which characterises this form of painting. Departing from the tradition of depicting scenes from Hindu mythology, Sircar has experimented with modern themes that give her paintings a totally original dimension. Also on display are Rajasthani minakari paintings and marble works, along with a fascinating array of stained-glass paintings. Real stained-glass lampshades and partitions, made from imported coloured glasses, add a dash of lustre, while handcrafted decorative candles and fibre artifacts provide sparkle to the show.

 Event: An exhibition of paintings, marble work and fibre artifacts by Paromita Sircar

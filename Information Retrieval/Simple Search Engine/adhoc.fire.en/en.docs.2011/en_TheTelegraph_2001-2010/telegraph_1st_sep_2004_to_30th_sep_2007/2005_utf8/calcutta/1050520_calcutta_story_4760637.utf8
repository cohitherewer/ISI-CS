 Gold Factory, the jewellery outlet that has made its mark as the place for innovative jewellery, has turned three. The anniversary collection consists of a range of favourites that includes thokai noksha (designs on beaten sheets of gold), terracotta pieces complemented with gold, budget diamonds and the latest addition in ceramic jewellery. 

 Chunky ceramic tiles in various shapes are acting as pendants with colourful beads. A touch of gold kundan work on some of the pendants adds a dash of traditional chic to these contemporary pieces. 

 A scheme for the diligent saver called Swarna Sanchay was also unveiled on the anniversary. The scheme is spread over a period of one, two or four years and members can save the price of 1 gm of gold every month. At the end of the year they get the accumulated amount and half a gram extra from the store. They can then use the amount to buy something of their choice, says Brinda Ganguly Sirkar of Gold Factory. 

 With lovely pieces of earrings, rings and nose-studs available for as little as Rs 2,000, the savings of the year might just throw up an entire jewellery set for the member.

 Safe diamonds

 Calcutta has just got its first jewellery showroom that is wholly certified by the International Gemological Institute (IGI), the body that assures quality control on precious stone jewellery. 

 B. Sethia amp; Sons Jewellers on Park Street that opened last week has ushered in an era of safe jewellery buying. At the store, every piece of diamond jewellery sold is certified by the international body assuring the buyer of the quality and cut of the stone. 

 Its of utmost importance for the retail buyer who hardly ever has a fair idea about stones. So he can be fooled into buying inferior quality at a higher price, feels Tehmasp Printer, managing director of IGI. 

 Each piece of jewellery stamped by IGI is accompanied by a certificate that works as a sign of guarantee, even when one wants to re-sell the jewellery at other stores across the world. 

 It removes any unwanted altercation between the buyer and the seller during the time of purchase. The certificate is the best proof, adds Printer. Besides diamonds, other coloured stones are also certified by IGI, especially to safegaurd against artificial stones. 

 The huge range at B. Sethia has been certified in a matter of a few days through a mobile lab that was brought in with experts. Its not possible for jewellers to take the risk of transporting their wares to us, says Printer. We intend to certify more stores in the city to ensure that interest of both buyers and sellers are addressed, adds Printer. 

 The certification should translate into better business for us since we can expect people to buy from here for safety, says Chhotulal Sethia of the outlet. 

 The collection at the store consists of elaborate pieces that are perfect for weddings. The designs, however, combine contemporary and traditional styles.

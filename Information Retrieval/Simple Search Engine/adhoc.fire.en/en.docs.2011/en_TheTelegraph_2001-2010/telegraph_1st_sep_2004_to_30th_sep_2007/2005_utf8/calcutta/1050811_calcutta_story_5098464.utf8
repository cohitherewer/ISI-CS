 Smart cards, or fine ahead

 - December action against car-owners who fail to turn in blue books

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 If you haven?t collected your smart card yet and have no plans to do so, carry some extra cash this winter when you take your car out for a morning spin.

 Concerned at the poor response to the directive to replace blue books of cars (registration certificates) with smart cards, the state transport department has decided to fine car-owners without the card from December.

 According to officials of the public vehicles department (PVD), it is mandatory for car-owners to replace their blue books with smart cards by paying Rs 560. 

 ?From June 27, we have started issuing smart cards in place of blue books. To facilitate the process, an office, with a dedicated workforce and computers, has been opened in a spacious building in Bakulbagan,? said PVD assistant director (registration) Manab Chakraborty.

 He added: ?The team was ready to issue at least 40,000 smart cards. But, to our surprise, only 13,000 car-owners have turned up. We are left with no alternative but to compel the car-owners to submit their blue books and obtain their smart cards.?

 PVD officials stated that beginning with WB-02 T, the smart cards of series S, R, Q and P (10,000 cars in each) are ready and the last date of delivery is already over. 

 Letters, mentioning the date and time of the delivery of the cards, have been sent to all car-owners, they added.

 As soon as the deadline to collect smart cards of a certain series expires, the blue books of the cars will automatically stand cancelled. Driving of a car of the series will subsequently be illegal, the officials explained. 

 Tapan Debnath, secretary of the Automobile Association of Eastern India (AAEI) ? an organisation of private car-owners ? said its members had already been urged to collect the smart cards. The AAEI would provide assistance in the procurement of the cards, he added.

 Transport department officials said they hoped to soon start issuing smart cards replacing the laminated driving licence and so it is important to complete delivery of the blue book replacements on time.

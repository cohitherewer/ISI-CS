 Festive fare in solo saga

 (From top) Models Sudipta, Tina and Ria showcase Sabyasachi Mukherjee creations at Espee 

 It was the first solo showcasing in Calcutta by the citys star stylist Sabyasachi Mukherjee in the past five years. So no wonder Espee boutique was packed to the brim with Pepsi loyalists and fashion followers making a beeline to catch a glimpse of the latest from the couture king on Wednesday morning.

 The young designer once again won over hearts as he launched his pre-season festive collection through a brief fashion show at the Rawdon Street store.

 I was really touched to see that all my clients ? from the oldest one to the newest ? attended the promotion. And the collections received an overwhelming response, it was almost a sellout by the end of the day, smiled Sabyasachi on Wednesday evening. 

 The show, having made the rounds of Mumbai and Delhi earlier this month, presented a bohemian collection meant for the forthcoming festive months. Its a transition collection between spring and winter and is meant for the festive season starting off with Raksha Bandhan. The clothes are very different, with lots of mix-and-match silhouettes, he explained.

 Silhouettes indeed is the high point of the line ? kurtas paired with petticoat skirts, churidars and crushed dupattas; saris teamed with chiffon coats; Umrao Jaan-style ankle-length kurtas...

 Volume is big this season and hence my clothes have lots of it. This is particularly true of a line inspired by Mughal clothes and tawaifs, said the designer. 

 The trademark Sabyasachi saris have got a makeover this season with lots of texturisation and innovative blouses. The collection also boasts some separates, mainly shirts.

 The show also offered glimpses of Sabyasachis creations that were recently launched at Browns and Selfridges in London, but with ample Indianisation. So, the long chiffon coats and satin belts that are right now adorning the racks of two of Londons biggest fashion houses were given a desi makeover for the show by pairing them with churidars.

 The palette was muted on the whole, quite in tune with the colour character of Sabyasachis creations over the last few seasons. Lots of ivory, old rose pink, pale aquamarine blue, moss green and brown were highlighted with dashes of bright hues here and there.

 City models Srestha, Sonali, Jessica, Amrita, Tina, Sudipta and Ria Mitra were among those who paraded the Pepsi designs.

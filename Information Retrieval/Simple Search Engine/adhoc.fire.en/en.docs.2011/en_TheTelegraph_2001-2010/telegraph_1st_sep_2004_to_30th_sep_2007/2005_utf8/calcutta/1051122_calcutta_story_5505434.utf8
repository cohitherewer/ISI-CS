 Simply see it, say it, scrabble it

 - New-age expressions, garnered from small screen, rule national-level war of words for schoolkids

 They speak a different ?lingo? and cast a different ?spell?. If D is for disc, O is for ouch ? and it?s all spelt out on the scrabble board.

 The zonal selection of the first National School Scrabble Championship, organised by a toy company, brought students from 19 schools across the city to engage in a war of words. And many of the words created with the tiles were at war with the language known to Gen-Ex.

 Zip, gizmo, ton, rev, disc, ouch, fave? All these tumbled out, winning precious points for those with a way with words. And the new-age expressions ? or rather small-screen impressions ? didn?t end there. So, one had ceat, zee, eno and mobel (sic), too. And they all went unchallenged.

 ?Ceat is a petrol company. I?ve seen it on TV,? declared Sidhant Agarwal of Class VIII, St Augustine?s School, at the end of the round. ?Mobil is some company name. Did I spell it wrong?? wondered Kusum Badlani, Class IX, Jewish Girls? School. She was far more confident defending the use of ?ouch?. ?I say it all the time,? shrugged the teenager. Kushal Mazumdar, of Class IX, St Augustine?s School, was almost condescending while explaining that ?gizmo? (he had spelt it ?gismo?) meant electrical toys and was unruffled about not knowing that ?fax? was actually an abbreviation.

 See it, say it, scrabble it seemed to be the motto at the Mattel meet. ?It?s true that TV and SMS are destroying the vocabulary of kids, which scrabble helps to build back. This is why, wherever we are going nationwide, teachers are welcoming the contest,? claims Rahul Bhowmik, head, marketing, boys? category, Mattel. The championship has reached out to about 300 schools across the country, for students in the 7-15 age group.

 Mome Banerjee, who teaches English at South Point School, was not surprised at the use of such scrabble words. ?This is exactly how they speak ? ?wow? to express admiration, ?ouch? when in pain, and ?zapped? when surprised.?

 Abbreviations have crept into the answer-scripts, too, with teachers commonly encountering ?exams?, ?abt?, ? amp;? and ?becoz?, especially in classes IX and X.

 The most damaging impact, some complain, is the confusion created by spellings used in advertisements. ?A child of Class II once asked me why ?kwik? was wrong, as he had seen it in print somewhere,? said Banerjee. ?Shoppe?, ?creme? and ?kwality? pose common problems, too.

 So is there a way out? ?Children must be encouraged to read, a habit that is dying with the onslaught of television and cyber games,? said Monideepa Lahiri, a teacher of Jewish Girls School, who had accompanied students to the weekend scrabble contest at Lake Gardens.

Intergalactic guide 

The Hitchhiker?s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas 

Adams is a trilogy in four parts. If that seems odd, then it?s just the beginning 

of one of the most incredible journeys across space, time and everything in between.

Written over the 1970s and 1980s, this cult classic 

tells the story of Arthur Dent, an Englishman who escapes earth minutes before 

it is destroyed and embarks on a mind-boggling trip of the galaxy with his alien 

friend Ford Prefect.

The idea for the series came to the author, he says, 

when he was ?lying drunk in a field in Austria? in 1971 with a battered copy of 

Hitchhiker?s Guide to Europe.

Years later, he developed the idea into a radio series 

for BBC and even later, the books, partly based on the radio show and partly re-written, 

followed.

Hilariously funny sometimes, deeply contemplative 

at others, but an extremely enjoyable read almost always, this book is a must 

on everyone?s reading list. To give away any more would be a crime punishable 

by the strictest of galactic laws.

The magic continues 

Stay glued to the screen and you can get on screen. 

Nick India presents a chance to young viewers to feature in India?s first live 

action-cum-animation series J Bole Toh Jadoo and share screen space with the lovable 

alien, introduced in Koi? Mil Gaya. One has to participate in the I want 

to be with Jadoo contest and help Jadoo in his quest against evil. 

Using state-of-the-art compositing technology that 

combines 3D animation with CGI (computer-generated imagery) in a digital setting 

previously seen in worldwide blockbusters like Space Jam, the winner will 

find himself in situations he could only have dreamt of ? zooming through space 

or criss-crossing his home planet Tarkopar that has two suns ? side-by-side with 

Jadoo.

To participate in the I want to be with Jadoo contest, 

fans only need to do what they do best ? keep watching J Bole Toh Jadoo till April 

17 every Saturday at 1 pm and Sunday at noon on Nick. Each episode will put forward 

a question to viewers, testing their knowledge of Jadoo?s exploits. Instant stardom 

and loads of fun await the kid who knows the series inside out.

Co-produced and co-authored by Nick and Graphiti Multimedia 

Private Limited, J Bole Toh Jadoo, India?s first ever live action-cum-animation 

series was launched on Nick in November 2004 to answer the questions of lakhs 

of children who saw the Hrithik Roshan-starrer, ?What happened to Jadoo after 

he returned to his home planet?? The show took off to a great response from kids 

across the country and has become Nick India?s flagship show.

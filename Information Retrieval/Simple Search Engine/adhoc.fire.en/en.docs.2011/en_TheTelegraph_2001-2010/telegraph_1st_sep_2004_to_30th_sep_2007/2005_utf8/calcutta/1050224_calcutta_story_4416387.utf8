 Madhyamik bar on cell phones in exam halls

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The board of secondary education has banned the use of mobile phones at the venues of Madhyamik 2005, to begin on February 25.

 The board on Wednesday asked its officials and teachers, who will conduct surprise checks, not to carry cell phones inside the exam centres.

 Till last year, only the examinees were barred from carrying mobile phones into the venues. Board president Dibyendu Hota said the ban was an additional measure to prevent any malpractice.

 He also announced that the board, along with police, would undertake special drives to ensure that photocopy centres remain closed during the duration of the tests. 

 Last year, photocopies of the mathematics question paper had reached a section of journalists minutes after the examination began.

 The examinees have also been barred from carrying any other electronic gadget, including calculators, into exam halls.

 The board chief urged the examinees to take less congested routes to reach the venues on time. The transport department and police have assured the board that traffic will be monitored on busy stretches on the examination days.

 Examinees and their parents have also been advised to inform the board if any organisation uses loudspeakers in their locality.

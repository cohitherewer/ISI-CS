 Fate of 200 tenants in balance

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Legal wrangles have dogged the 200 tenants of Ganesh Garh, covering 52 cottahs at 263, Rabindra Sarani (earlier 374, Upper Chitpore Road, according to the building plan dated 1894), since 1981. Once part of the Cossimbazar Raj Wards Estate, it changed hands in 1995. Tenants allege an apartment block will be built there after their eviction. 

 Maharaja Sris Chandra Nandy used to be the manager of the estate. In 1967, after the death of Sris, his widow, Maharani Nilima Prova Nandy, and son, Maharaj Kumar Somendra Chandra Nandy, sold it to Great Bengal Properties and Construction Private Limited, one of whose directors was Samit Chandra Nandy, son of Somendra. 

 The property was leased to Laddu Gopal Bajoria. The 50-year lease ended in 1981 and Bajoria went to court so that the lease could be continued. 

 In 1995, Great Bengal Properties finally sold the building to Amar Chand Lakhotia, a former tenant, for Rs 24 lakh along with 200 tenants. Bajoria went to the Supreme Court but his case was rejected. Now tenants allege the Lakhotias are trying to evict them. 

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) declared the building unsafe in a notice dated March 5, 2002. It did not allow the tenants? association to carry out repairs either. Cases filed by tenants are still pending in the high court and the lower courts.

 But four of the tenants ? Mahesh Chand Gupta, Raj Kumar Bhatter, Chandrawali Devi Sanghai and Baidyanath Rudra ? went to the Supreme Court after their case to establish their rights as tenants was dismissed by the high court. On April 24, 2004, a division bench of the high court had ruled that ?we are unable to hold that the appellants have been able to establish any independent right or title and their legal status at the material point of time was that of a sub-lessee/sub-tenant under a tenant governed by Transfer of Property Act...? 

 On August 23, 2004, special leave petitions were accepted by the Supreme Court. Notice was served on the landlord, and dates were issued three times. But on the fourth occasion, a new judge, A.R. Laxmanan, accepted the high court order and dismissed the four tenants? petition on January 7 without a hearing.

 The four filed a review petition on February 7. The Supreme Court wanted the four to vacate within three weeks. But then the court extended the deadline till March 31 with an undertaking. The four will pray for a year?s time to vacate the building.

Life

 Stun the sun 

 From cheap local varieties to international labels, the city is flooded with options in sunglasses. Zeeshan Jawed eyes the fare

 If the summer glare is getting to you, hide behind a pair of shades. Apart from keeping the scorching sun at bay, good-looking sunglasses can do wonders for your attitude (and hide a few blemishes to boot).

 Men in particular, who have so few accessories to embellish their wardrobes with, can make the most of the flood of big brands now at their disposal, but only if budget is a non-issue.

 Names like Hugo Boss, Versace and Gucci may not be commonplace yet, but they can be spotted at city malls and optical outlets, as well as shielding the lucky face here or there.

 For those who need not have a status symbol perched on their noses, a trek through New Market, Metro gulli and markets such as Metro Plaza and Vardaan could throw up wallet-friendly buys.

 Shop smart

 If you are giving the designer labels a miss, do ensure your eyes do not suffer, for there can be more to bargain pairs than meets the eye.

 A pair of sunglasses is more than a style statement. They should primarily block the ultraviolet rays that are harmful for the eyes, says Arpan Chaudhuri, city-based ophthalmologist. The doctor also cautions against roadside stalls.

 Before making the purchase, one should make sure that the lenses are powerless and fit into the frame properly, explains Sharat Binani, director, Himalaya Optical.

 Once the basics are taken care of, shift focus to style. While carefully chosen shades can add instant style and class to the face, the wrong ones can prove disastrous. A good rule of thumb is if you have a round face, go for oval or wrap around frames, while if you have a long, thin face, try rounder frames.

 Designer wear

 International brands target the upmarket buyer, with different labels appealing to different folk. Cartier is the premium name for those who want a touch of class to their personality, mostly on the wrong side of 30. Those in search of oodles of attitude would grab a Versace or Tommy Hilfiger.

 Shades from the international brands are never found wanting in their quality, size and fit, says Joydeep Datta, manager, GKB Opticals on Park Street.

 Cartier ranges between Rs 15,000 and Rs 35,000. The more casual shades usually come at between Rs 6,000 and Rs 15,000.

 Sport on

 If you swear by cricketers, there is only one option for you: wrap-around shades. The design is trendy ? rock star Bono is rarely seen without them ? and also provides maximum protection from sun and dust.

 The big lenses come in green, yellow and orange hues. The sporty picks are available in brands like Oakley, D amp;G and Giorgio Armani in the outlets of GKB Opticals and Himalaya Optical. The pocket pinch can be between Rs 6,000 and Rs 21,000. 

 Polarised lenses

 When the strong rays of the sun fall on the sunglasses, a glare is created on the surface. This hampers the vision and objects at some distance cannot be seen properly, explains Datta. To get rid of that, a thin polarised film is put between two sheets of the lens, he adds.

 Oakley, Oxyde and Police are the brands that come with polarised film, and cost between Rs 6,000 and Rs 12,000 at GKB Opticals, Himalaya Optical and Lawrence and Mayo. 

 Stylish buys

 Style with sense can also be yours if you look in the right place. Fast Track, from the house of Titan, has a range of sunglasses that protect your eyes as well as your pocket.

 Big lenses in myriad colours are catching everybodys eye, reveals Bijou Kurien, COO, Titan Industries. From classic black to funky orange, the chic and trendy shades come in corrosion-resistant stainless steel, designed to provide maximum comfort. They also promise 100 per cent protection from ultraviolet rays, starting at Rs 600. 

 Also on the low side ? compared with the rest, of course ? is Ray Bans Aviator range, which begins at Rs 2,500.

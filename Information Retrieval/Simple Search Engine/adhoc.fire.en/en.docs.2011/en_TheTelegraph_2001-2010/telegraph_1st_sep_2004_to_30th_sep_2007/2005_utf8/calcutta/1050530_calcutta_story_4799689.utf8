 Cinema rolls out banquet glitz

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 The seats, projector and giant screen have all been wheeled out; the freshly done glitzy hall will now reverberate with the sounds of wedding bells and the footsteps of party people. Five years after its shutdown, Jamuna cinema, once the hot seat of Hollywood films, reopened its doors as a banquet hall on Sunday evening.

 With this, the 31/2B Marquis Street address joins a growing line of standalone halls in the Chowringhee-Esplanade belt turning to alternative business models to stay afloat ? Majestic is now a hotel, while Lighthouse and New Cinema have been converted into garments stores.

 Noticing a ?lack of quality banquets barring the five-star hotels? in the city, owner Vishu Behrus decided to turn Jamuna into one. ?We will provide five-star quality at competitive rates. We have our own catering service which will offer snacks and full-course meals,? says Behrus, whose father Jamunadas Behrunani raised the curtains of the hall in 1977 with the Shashi Kapoor, Vinod Khanna, Shabana Azmi and Parveen Babi-starrer Chor Sipahi. 

 But within 10 weeks of opening, the owners dropped Hindi potboilers and switched to English films. From James Bond to Steven Spielberg and every blockbuster in between, old timers also remember queuing up for the noon shows which screened masters like Francois Truffaut, Ingmer Bergman and Istvan Szabo.

 Jamuna shut shop in 2001 following huge losses and labour trouble. By 1998, the owners had realised that running the hall wasn?t viable and were thinking of a closure. The lockout in 2001 precipitated the shutdown. 

 Now, the two-storeyed Jamuna Banquets will be available for weddings, receptions, private parties, conferences and exhibitions. Orchid, the 3,000-sq feet ground-floor hall, can accommodate 250 people, while Tulip on the first floor is just double the size with a capacity of 600. Both have been done up with marbled floors, soft lighting and woodwork. 

 Behrus never considered a revival as it would have meant huge expenditure. ?Video piracy and cable TV have ruined our business. Besides, standalone halls don?t have the ambience of multiplexes, so why will people come?? he argues.

 Like Behrus, owners of several other standalone halls have realised that their businesses are sinking. ?We will explore other options. A revival is definitely not possible,? says Lalit Kankaria, owner of Orient, which closed down last year. 

 One hall in the central business district trying to match the multiplex moves is Paradise. Footfall at the Bentinck Street address has picked up since last year, but only after a costly makeover.

 The choice for most standalone halls seems to be: reinvent or shut down.

 Rail sieve for fake workers

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Alarmed over the spurt in job rackets in the railways, the authorities are eyeing a mechanism to prevent recruitment based on fake documents and detect those already employed through fraudulent means.

 The Eastern Railway (ER) has recently sacked more than 20 employees whose appointments turned out to be fake. Several such people are still working in the Sealdah and Asansol divisions.

 Another racket has been busted at the railways? BR Singh Hospital, Sealdah, where a group of people were availing of treatment by producing fake papers.

 Elaborating on the new security system, a senior ER official said: ?We will soon introduce special papers for issuing promotion and transfer orders.? The papers, containing the serial numbers of the employees and a hologram, will be kept in the custody of a few authorised officials. 

 Officials will also verify the employees? records of the past three years. If the papers reveal anything suspicious, the records of another three years will be examined.

 ?The salary of a recruit will not be released unless it is approved by a very senior functionary,? the official said. 

 Besides, a computerised manpower management device has been introduced to identify fake employees.

 Senior officials, however, conceded that it would be extremely difficult to devise a foolproof system that would keep tabs on the 1.5 million-odd employees of the railways. Around 1.3 lakh of them are employed in the ER alone. 

 Some time ago, 106 persons had been caught at Zonal Railway Training Institute, Dhanbad. All of them had procured forged appointment letters for Group-D jobs and were being trained for promotion to the Group-C level. 

 A few months earlier, a racket had been busted in the Malda division, where 108 persons were found to be working with forged letters. 

 Sources said the Central Bureau of Investigation had busted a racket at Lucknow Railway Establishment, after which 520 people were sacked.

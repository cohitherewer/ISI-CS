 Mumait mania ruled Tantra on Saturday night. All eyes were on the sultry item babe as she rocked the night club at The Park.

 Mumait Khan is in the news for her latest dance-floor moves in the movie Chocolate. She chose Mummy ko nahin hai pata and Jhuki jhuki from Chocolate for her opening performance, well after midnight.

 It was the runaway hit remix of Mere piya gaye Rangoon (the video of the song featured Mumait) for her second sequence. The third and the fourth sequences were performed to chartbusters like Kajra re and Dus bahane.

 This is my third performance in Tantra. I love the place particularly because of its people, who come in droves to watch my performance, said the Dekh le girl, during a pause before setting the bar-top on fire, one more time.

 Low-slung jeans, short skirts, cholis and provocative moves ensured that all but cell phone cameras came to a standstill. And the camera phones had a field night ? as did the testosterone levels ? zooming in on the tattoos on the famed Mumait midriff, and more.

 Remix rule

 Fusion, the resto-bar at The Golden Park, hosted DJ Akbar Sami on Saturday night. The DJ created ripples with his remix Jalwa, one of his early hits.

 Todays toppers include the remix of Just chill from Maine Pyar Kyon Kiya and the title track of Aashiq Banaya Aapne.

 When I did Jalwa, very few people thought that remixing would become such a rage. Shows outside India are keeping me busy nowadays. As a result, I was not getting time to do much of my work. But I am happy that I have worked on these two chartbusters. These song are going to be big in the night clubs in the coming weeks, said Sami.

 The crowd at Fusion, which danced to the tunes of DJ Suketu last week, hit the floor with Saara zamana haseenon ka deewana. The DJ played a good mix of new and old songs ? Kajra re and Dus bahane to Om shanti om and Aap jaisa koi? ? keeping the action going till 3 in the morning.

 Music medley

 After Gary Lawyer, Carl Clements and Ehsaan and Loy (of Shankar, Ehsaan and Loy fame), it was the turn of Indian Ocean to drown a section of the party people with the sound of music.

 The band comprising Asheem Chakroborty (tabla and vocals), Sushmit Sen (guitar and vocals), Rahul Ram and Amit Kilam (drums) hit Someplace Else on Saturday night. The pub at The Park has been celebrating its 11th anniversary all August.

 Indian Ocean gave Someplace Else regulars a fusion medley to remember, playing original hits like Bandeh, Kandisa, Bhor, Maa Rewa and Hille Re.

 The entire month of August has been full of revelry at Someplace Else. The stupendous performances by such stalwarts and the ambience of Someplace Else have attracted record footfalls this month, said a spokesperson for the pub.

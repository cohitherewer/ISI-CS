 Girl sent away twice from hospital dies

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A critically ill, five-year-old girl, denied admission by RG Kar Medical College and Hospital twice in the past two days on the grounds that her condition was not serious enough, died at the emergency ward on Thursday morning.

 Relatives and neighbours of Riya Das, who bled from the nose and mouth and ran a high fever, heckled doctors of the paediatrics department after the death and lodged a complaint with the medical superintendent. An inquiry has been ordered.

 Riya, a resident of Sovabazar, was suffering from high fever and other ailments for the past week. She was also not eating anything. 

 Her condition worsened on Tuesday night, prompting parents Kebal and Kakoli to take her to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital.

 It was around 10 pm when the three reached the emergency ward, where doctors checked the child and referred her to the paediatrics department. That department, however, decided that Riya was suffering from a minor ailment and turned down the parents? plea to admit her. 

 ?Instead, they prescribed some medicines worth Rs 300 and advised certain blood tests,? said Kebal.

 Twelve hours later, there was no sign of the fever abating. Her condition, in fact, become more critical, as she started vomiting and bleeding from the nose and mouth.

 Again she was taken to the hospital, again the emergency ward referred her to the paediatrics department, and once again the doctors rejected repeated pleas by Riya?s parents and neighbours to admit her.

 At home, Riya?s condition was steadily deteriorating and on Thursday morning, she fell unconscious. Her parents and neighbours, helpless at the turn of events, again took her to the hospital, where she died while doctors at the emergency ward were attending to her.

 ?We shuttled between the emergency and the paediatrics wards each day that we brought her to the hospital. Despite her condition worsening by the hour, the doctors refused to take her in,? said Debraj Mitra, a neighbour of Kebal. He demanded that the ?guilty doctors? be punished.

 Medical superintendent Pradip Mitra said: ?A complaint has been lodged by the girl?s parents and I have asked the head of the paediatrics department to probe the allegations. The doctors told me that her condition did not warrant admission. It?s not clear what caused the death, but it seems she suffered internal haemorrhage.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Aftershock tremors

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The city recorded tremors twice within four hours on Sunday night and early on Monday. The Alipore Met office has attributed the tremors to the aftershocks of the December 26 earthquake that had caused the killer tsunami. 

 Monday?s tremor was 6.2 on the Richter scale and that of Sunday night, 5.4. The epicentre lay on the west coast of northern Sumatra, where a quake of ?moderate intensity? had taken place. 

 ?The aftershocks may continue for a month or more. It takes some time for the earth to regain its equilibrium after such a great shock,? said K.K. Chakraborty of the Met office.

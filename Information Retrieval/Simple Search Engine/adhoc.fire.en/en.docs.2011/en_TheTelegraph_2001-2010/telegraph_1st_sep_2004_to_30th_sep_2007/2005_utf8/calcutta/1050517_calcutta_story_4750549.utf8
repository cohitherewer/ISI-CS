 History amp; Hayden

 Brad Pitt and Adolf Hitler will be featured on 

 Biography with Diana Hayden

Did you know Pervez Musharraf was a body-building champion? Or that as a 10-year-old, Fidel Castro wrote to the US President asking for a $10 bill as he had never seen one? Most people wouldn?t. 

 ?History in the classroom can be horrible if it comes across as just dates and names. One needs to adopt a story-telling format to make it come alive,? says Diana Hayden, beauty queen and actress, while admitting to reading story books during her history classes in school. 

 The History Channel has for long tried to be the place ?where the past comes alive?, but this time it is making sure the experience is even more entertaining by introducing an Indian host. On Monday night, its signature show Biography premiered in a new avatar with Hayden at the helm. ?She brings an Indian connection to the show besides passing on interesting trivia about the person being featured,? explains Dilshad Master, senior vice-president, content amp; communications. 

 Biography with Diana Hayden, a one-hour show on weekdays at 10 pm, will cover three themes: World Leaders, Sports Stars and Hollywood Stars . The series will feature key personalities of the 20th century from politics (George Bush, beaming on Tuesday night, the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, Hitler, Putin, Arafat...), sports (Jimmy Connors, Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi, Steffi Graf, Arthur Ashe, Venus and Serena Williams, Chris Evert, Tiger Woods, Michael Jordan...) and cinema (Brad Pitt, Bo Derek, Tom Hanks, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Drew Barrymore, Christopher Reeve and more). 

Extensive research has gone into each episode. Says Master: ?Our team centred in the US went across the world, contacting news channels as well as individuals in search of video footage. So you get to see some rare scenes. Tony Blair at 19 wanted to be a rockstar and we have him looking like a complete hippie. Indira Gandhi is smiling and laughing with her cabinet colleagues just after taking over as Prime Minister in moments never yet shown in any documentary.? 

 On the last Friday of every theme month there would be a chat show with Diana in the interviewer?s seat. After the leaders? segment, she speaks to Natwar Singh and Salman Khurshid. On sports, she speaks to the likes of Mahesh Bhupathi. After the Hollywood series, her guests are Nandana Sen, Mahesh Bhatt and Gulshan Grover. ?Natwar Singh had so many personal memories of and insights on Clinton, Blair, Gorbachev and Nehru, that I told him you should have been my history teacher,? Diana laughs.

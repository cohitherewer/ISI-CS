 Bank rap on varsity trio

 - Assessment of teachers by students deemed must 

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 The universities of Calcutta and Jadavpur and Bengal Engineering and Science University (BESU) are among the educational institutions pulled up by the World Bank for not allowing students to assess their teachers.

 The universities have availed of the World Bank funds under a Rs 153-crore project to improve quality of technical education. Assessment of teachers by students is mandatory under the scheme, which took off in November 2004.

 Academic audits by a team of experts have revealed that assessment of teachers by the students is still a no-no in the institutions. The team was put together by the Centre at the instance of the World Bank. 

 ?The institutions are expected to immediately take steps to start assessment of their teachers by the students. They should begin the exercise not just because they are availing of World Bank funds, but also since this kind of an arrangement is a must in any modern education system,? said Sajal Dasgupta, director of technical education. 

 He is a key member of the special unit set up by the Centre to facilitate the implementation of the project.

 The performance of the institutions with respect to other conditions laid down by the Bank is ?far better? compared with their counterparts in other states, Dasgupta added.

 Education department officials who attended the audits said the experts also expressed unhappiness over a lack of initiative on the part of the authorities to keep their campuses clean.

 The findings of the audit have reportedly worried the state government. The funds have been provided to the state-aided institutions as a grant. If the aid is withdrawn, the government will be liable to repay the utilised amount. 

 Calcutta University has been allotted Rs 30 crore, while Jadavpur University and BESU have received Rs 24 crore each.

 Seven more institutions, including some private engineering colleges, are also receiving the aid. Their share is between Rs 8 and 10 crore. 

 The private colleges, however, will have to repay the amount as loan. 

 ?We have just started the process of introducing assessment of teachers by the students. We hope to satisfy the World Bank regarding this. We have fulfilled most of the other conditions laid down by the bank,? stated N.R. Banerjea, vice-chancellor, BESU.

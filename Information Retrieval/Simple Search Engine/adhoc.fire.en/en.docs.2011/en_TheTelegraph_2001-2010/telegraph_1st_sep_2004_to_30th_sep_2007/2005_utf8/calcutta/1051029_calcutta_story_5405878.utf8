 Theres good news for Calcutta women this Diwali ? the launch of a new line of diamond jewellery at the CIT Road showroom of Senco Gold.

 Called Dyuti, the first Hearts amp; Arrows diamond brand has been brought to the city by Senco Gold in association with DTC. Launching this range was actress Rituparna Sengupta.

 What makes the Hearts amp; Arrows diamonds special is an exclusive cut, helping them exhibit a hearts-and arrows pattern.

 CEO of Senco Gold Sankar Sen said: This is a brand that reflects the brilliance of every facet in a diamond with its fire and lustre. Because of the craftsmanship required, only one in a million diamonds can attain the perfection of a true Hearts amp; Arrows brand.

 The 18-carat range of diamond jewellery includes rings, pendants, nosepins and eartops, priced anywhere between Rs 7,600 and Rs 20,000.

 Premjit Sengupta, DTC-manager east, said: With its Hearts amp; Arrows diamonds used from DTC, Dyuti should go a long way with exclusivity and affordability.

 Classic call

 The Antarmahal jewellery, which is classical and detailed to the core, was also launched keeping in mind the ongoing festive season.

 Director Anargha Chowdhury said: The jewellery has been crafted to perfection after months of research by our inhouse designers, in close association with Rituparno Ghosh. We have worked with him earlier too, but this time there was a greater challenge, as a whole lot of detailing was involved, especially in designing jewellery for Abhishek Bachchan and Jackie Shroff. A lot of effort has also gone into creating the unique hair accessories for Soha Ali Khan.

 If jewellery for the male leads includes silver armlets, hansuli, tabeej, brooch, kada and neckpieces, for Chhotobou Soha there were heavy necklaces, sitahar, teenlahari haar, ranihaar, jadoa bangles, classic nose rings, nakshi churis, manthashas and earpieces like kaan, kaanbala and pasha. Finely-detailed hair accessories like mathar bagan, tana, ornate clips and combs are a unique feature of this collection.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Attendance at JU test falls to one

 TAMAL SENGUPTA AND JULIUS GOMES

 One. That was the student count on Day II of the engineering and technology faculty?s semester examinations being boycotted at Jadavpur University (JU).

 The show of defiance against the authorities? decision to slap showcause notices on five senior students hardened on Tuesday, with only a single final-year student appearing for a supplementary examination, on the Jadavpur and Salt Lake campuses. Monday?s examinee count was 162.

 Students of the science faculty, too, pitched in by boycotting classes on Tuesday.

 With no signs of the students blinking, the JU authorities are in a fix. And adding to their dilemma are the uniform replies handed over by four of the five students who were showcaused for campus violence after being implicated in the report submitted by the Amit Sen inquiry commission.

 Officials handling the legalities of the impasse said on condition of anonymity that the charges cited in the inquiry commission?s report against each of the five students were different, and that each one of them had been handed a separate showcause notice.

 The officials were expecting divergent replies from the students, but all their explanations have come framed in the same format and language.

 ?At this initial stage, their replies cannot be considered satisfactory, and it will be difficult to take any immediate decision,? admitted an official.

 Faculty of engineering and technology students? union (Fetsu) supporters, demanding changes in the examination system, had gheraoed the vice-chancellor and other members of the university examination board for 28 hours on September 15 and 16, 2003. This had sparked violence.

 The Amit Sen commission submitted its report on March 15, indicting five students for crimes under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and suggesting that ?students who resort to violence should be dealt with like any other offender?.

 The commission even recommended that a ?law-enforcement agency be engaged to stamp out any criminal activity inside the campus?.

 Asked whether the university would initiate legal action under the IPC against the five students, registrar Rajat Bandopadhyay said: ?Neither do we consider ourselves the police, nor are our students criminals. We are the guardians of our students and expect respect from them.?

 It created quite a stir in the locality and was on the verge of being killed by panic-stricken villagers. But thanks to forest department officials, the eight-ft python that was spotted in a pond in South 24-Parganas was saved and taken to the Salt Lake rescue centre of the department.

 On Friday, the python was shifted to West Bengal Snake Park in Badu, Madhyamgram, on the northern fringes of the city. ?We plan to transfer it to the zoo, but the final decision is yet to be taken,? said V.K. Yadav, deputy chief wildlife warden. 

 ?The snake park authorities are better equipped to look after the python,? an official explained. The python, generally found in the Dooars and other mountainous terrain in north Bengal and elsewhere in the country, is feeding on birds, rats and pigeons. ?It has no injury marks and is apparently doing fine,? the official added. 

 The python was rescued from Atasura village in Magrahat, Diamond Harbour, earlier in the week. Manoranjan Sardar, a resident of the village, discovered it while cleaning his pond. He cried out in fright and was soon joined by neighbours. 

 ?The python stayed coiled in the mud and did not move. But the villagers decided that it should be killed,? a forest department official said.

 One of the villagers, however, called up the forest officials and asked the crowd to wait till they arrived. A team of four officers from the Salt Lake rescue centre rushed to the spot and with the help of local forest department staff, managed to put the python in a sack and carry it to the centre. 

 According to forest officials, the pond in Magrahat was the most unlikely place for the python to stay. ?We are not sure how it got there. Pythons are generally found in the hills. This one might have escaped from a snake charmer,? said an official.

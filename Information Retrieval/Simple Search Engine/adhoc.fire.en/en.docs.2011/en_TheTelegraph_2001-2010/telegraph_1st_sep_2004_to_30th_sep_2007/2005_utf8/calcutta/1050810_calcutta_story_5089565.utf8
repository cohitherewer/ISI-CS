The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Doll-up team at tech town

 - Board formed to maintain, develop Sector V facilities

 DEVADEEP PUROHIT

 After bestowing industrial township status on Salt Lake?s Sector V, the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government is ready to give the state?s information technology hub a new look and create an ?enabling environment? for further growth of the IT and IT-enabled services industry (ITES).

 The aim is to make the 434-acre zone, earlier part of Bidhannagar Municipality, a model industrial township. 

 This would involve smooth and well-lit roads connecting EM Bypass and Rajarhat, beautification along the roads and the eastern drainage canal, a food park behind Nicco Park (on fisheries department land), new bus and taxi stands, a chartered bus service, new car parks and pay-and-use toilets.

 ?A board comprising officials from the IT and the urban development departments, Webel and company representatives will look after affairs in Sector V,? confirmed Ravi Kant, managing director, Webel.

 ?The board will collect taxes, plan developmental projects and implement them by identifying suitable private partners,? he added.

 The board?s mandate will include maintaining the existing infrastructure and conceptualising and implementing new infrastructure and beautification projects in the tech town and its adjoining areas.

 Last month, IT minister Manab Mukherjee and urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya had deliberated on a host of projects and finalised a blueprint for Sector V. Action points were decided on the basis of feedback from companies based there.

 Around 200 companies, including IBM, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTS) and Wipro, have their offices in Sector V and around 20,000 people work there.

 ?We got tired of the passing-the-buck game among agencies like Webel, Bidhannagar Municipality and the urban development department. We hope that the industrial township status will improve delivery of services and make life easier for us,? said a Sector V-based entrepreneur.

 Now, the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) will be the nodal agency. 

 ?The government will provide land and private bidders will develop and run the facilities. Eight sites have already been identified, for which the CMDA will float tenders,? said an urban development official, adding that the blueprint stresses timely implementation of the projects.

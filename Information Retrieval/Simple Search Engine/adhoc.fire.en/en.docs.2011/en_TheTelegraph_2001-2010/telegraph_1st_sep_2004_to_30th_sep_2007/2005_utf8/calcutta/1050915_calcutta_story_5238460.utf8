 Machine, power failure at hospital

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Critical patients had to suffer after the emergency operating theatre in the gynaecology department and the dialysis unit at NRS Medical College and Hospital were shut down on Wednesday. 

 While the autoclave machine, used for sterilisation, developed a snag in the operating theatre, an alarmingly high level of chloride was detected in the water purified for dialysis. 

 Moreover, parts of the hospital remained in the dark for over three hours, owing to a scheduled power cut. The authorities were forced to turn away patients from the outdoor department.

 Tetanus spores were discovered in the emergency operating theatre of the gynaecology department in the morning, forcing its closure. The operating theatre, located on the second floor of the main hospital building, is used for complicated cases.

 Several women in labour had to be shifted to other hospitals as a result.

 ?We were helpless, as the autoclave machine, used to sterilise the instruments used during Caesarian section, broke down in the morning. As sterilisation was not possible, the scheduled operations had to be cancelled,? said a doctor of the gynaecology department.

 He added: ?Some of the women in labour developed complications. They had to be referred to other hospitals. There was also intermittent disruptions in power supply to various parts of the hospital.? 

 Those suffering from chronic renal failure and emergency renal failure were also at the receiving end because the dialysis unit of the hospital was shut down around the same time.

 Water supplied by Calcutta Municipal Corporation is processed in the hospital?s purifying plant before being used for dialysis. On Wednesday morning, the treated water was found to contain chloride far above the permissible level.

 Eight patients scheduled for dialysis had to be turned away subsequently.

 ?The water is monitored by the minute while dialysis is on. Today, the water was found to contain a high level of chloride and was, thus, deemed unsuitable for dialysis. The patients have been asked to come back later,? said a doctor of the nephrology department.

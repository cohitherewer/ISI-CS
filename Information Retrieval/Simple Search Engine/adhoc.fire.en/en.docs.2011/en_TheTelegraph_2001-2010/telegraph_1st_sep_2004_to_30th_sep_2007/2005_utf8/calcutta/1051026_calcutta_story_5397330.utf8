The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Countess on a ?rescue mission?

 - Project in 18 countries for Aids prevention and care

 SEBANTI SARKAR

 Countess Albina du Boisrouvray

 Face framed in dark shoulder-length hair, reddish-orange churidar, bindi and a necklace of coins ? hardly what one expects of a Swiss countess. But then this is Countess Albina du Boisrouvray, who has been coming to India over and over again through the last decade, hoping ?to make big noise about the HIV/AIDS pandemic?. 

 Countess Albina is founder/president of the Association Francois-Xavier Bagnoud (AFXB), an NGO working in 18 countries for AIDS prevention and care. AFXB, funded primarily by the countess is named after her pilot son who died in a rescue mission in 1986. The countess describes her own project as a rescue mission, ?because every second, somewhere in the world, a mother or father dies of AIDS, often leaving behind orphans some of whom are also infected. So the sooner we achieve our goals the more lives we save?.

 This time the countess is in Calcutta with fresh hope not only because of the ?public openness? but because the state government has promised its support and a grant of Rs 22 lakh for her campaign with jute mill workers, a high-risk group. During her visit in 2002 she had reached migrant workers, supervisors and medical officers of 10 jute mills in and around Howrah. This time she hopes to reach 10 more.

 In collaboration with the Howrah Municipal Corporation and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation she will conduct awareness and prevention education programmes for healthcare workers, women and adolescent girls. A teacher?s training programme to spread awareness in schools will be conducted at the Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre on October 26. AFXB will also address a conclave of the Assam Rifles and the countess, assured of more help from foreign donors, hopes someday to have an open community centre for AIDS orphans in Bengal.

 The AFXB India Society has been operating since the early 90s. In 1991, an AFXB home for HIV-infected children opened in Goa. In 1992, AFXB workers were present in Manipur and the battle continued in Vizag, Chennai, Pondicherry, Mumbai and other states. The annual AFXB budget for India is over $100,000 of which 50-60 per cent is devoted to the eastern zone. But ?the sheer diversity of cultures the stigma and taboos have always been hard to deal with.? In 1991, during a press conference in Rajasthan, reporters just ?walked out, insulted by the open discussion of sex and AIDS?. 

 But then every country has its own problems and the countess is ?very hopeful, because Indians are very innovative?.

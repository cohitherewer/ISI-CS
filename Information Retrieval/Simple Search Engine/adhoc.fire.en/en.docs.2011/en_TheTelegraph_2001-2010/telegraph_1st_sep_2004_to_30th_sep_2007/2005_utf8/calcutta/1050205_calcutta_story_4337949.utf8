The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Site search for fair titles

 SANGITA SULTANIA G. ROY

 You don?t have to lose your way in the maze of Calcutta Book Fair 2006 in search of an obscure title. If things work out as Tamal Dasgupta and Subrata Biswas have planned, just log on to bookbaazar.com to get a complete list of books and authors in each stall.

 For now, the site allows a browse through the treasure trove of books on offer by over 8,000 publishers in more than 80 countries.

 The first of its kind in the country, the site aims to facilitate uninterrupted buying and selling of books in almost all major languages in the world. 

 After logging on, one needs to run a search for a title and details of the book ? in hardcover or paperback, new and used, from stores and individual sellers across the world ? will flash on the screen.

 Launched at the ongoing fair, the website is the brainchild of Dasgupta and Biswas, who are offering it as a ?platform for all publishers to get together?. The site was conceptualised by Biswas, in the news recently for making palkis for weddings, and Dasgupta, a web developer. 

 Uploading the site involved a painstaking process of getting an extensive list of publishers from the Net and known sources and contacting them one by one. The endeavour to expand the database is on at the fair as well, where the duo is operating from the Doel Publications stall (no. 163). ?We have received a phenomenal response. Almost all the participating publishers have registered with us,? says Dasgupta. 

 And why not, considering that the service is completely free. ?It?s my hobby to develop such websites, which can be of some use to people,? says Dasgupta, who has to his credit ventures like worldphoneindex.com, which lists major mobile operators in the world.

 The free service also differentiates the website from Amazon.com, which charges a commission per transaction. At bookbaazar.com, buyers can directly interact with sellers, but the duo continues to provide additional services of answering queries of failed searches, besides being in charge of regular maintenance of the site.

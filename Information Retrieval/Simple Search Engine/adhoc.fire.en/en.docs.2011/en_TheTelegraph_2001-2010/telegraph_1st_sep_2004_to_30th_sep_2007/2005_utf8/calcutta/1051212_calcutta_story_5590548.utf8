The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

Lara?s theme: alive amp; kickin?

Screen On amp; Off

 Movie mode: Prahlad Kakkar

 She has played the lead (Mumbai Se Aaya Mera Dost), played second fiddle (Andaaz), shrieked and screamed (Kaal), hidden in a crowd (No Entry) but is still best remembered for her item number in Khakee. Despite so many releases, Lara Dutta is very much the Aisa jadoo dala re girl.

 So, in her new film, Sanjay Gupta?s Zinda, she?s been given a twin role. Apart from playing one of the four characters of the movie ? alongside Sanjay Dutt, John Abraham, Celina Jaitley ? Lara will be seen jiving to the title song in the otherwise songless movie.

 The song has been sung by Shibani Kashyap who last made an impression with Saajna aa bhi jaa in Waisa Bhi Hota Hai Part 2. Like the Shashanka Ghosh movie, here too Shibani will be seen in the song picturisation, singing and dancing with Lara. The song will be used either with the opening or the end credits.

 Currently being used as a music video to promote the film, the Zinda title song has been shot in grand style with Lara dancing on six lakh pieces of glass. The other video from the film has Pakistani band Strings performing, with Dutt and John joining the duo with some recited lines.

 Now that the judges have done their job, it?s time for the audience to choose their next Indian Idol. Beginning this Monday, seven male contestants of the chosen 28 will strain their vocal chords in a bid to make it to the next stage. 

 Of the seven, there is quite a mix of professionals and amateurs. While Mumbai man Kshitij Wagh is a favourite with the judges, 20-year-old Sagar Arun Sawarkar has a thorough grounding in classical music. Then there?s Hyderabad-based N.C. Karunya, who is a big fan of South Indian film music while Rohit Raj Sinha from Allahabad became a singer only to win a challenge. Also in queue is Delhi boy Mukesh Tomar whose father is a driver with Delhi Transport and Mumbai guy Shree Kumar, who has his roots deeply embedded in Carnatic music.

 Yet again, it?s the audience who gets to choose who they want to make it to level next and who they want to eliminate. The judges are there to help the janata make their decisions. In fact, they have even fought for their individual choices. After one of the contestants, Ravi Tripathi, sang Tumse milke from Parinda, Sonu Nigam thought that the Mumbai contestant didn?t live up to expectations, to which Anu Malik said: ?I don?t agree with you Sonu and won?t pass such comments on television. There are millions of people watching him and will vote for him.?

 Also catch the fourth judge for this week, the sweet and sexy Nikki Bakshi, actress Tanishaa. She not only encourages the singers but gives them a tip or two. Indian Idol 2 comes on Sony, Monday, 8.30 pm.

 This year has seen a record number of ad film-makers turning to feature film-making. From Pradeep Sarkar to Shoojit Sircar, it has been a success story for the men who?ve switched from 30-second commercials to two-hour-long movies. And the lastest to join that bandwagon is the ad guru himself, Prahlad Kakkar.

 To start with, Prahlad is not sitting in the director?s chair himself. His assistant Sujat Saudagar will be making the first film for his production house Genesis Features.

 Titled Bitter Rain, it will star Sonu Sood, Manoj Bajpai and Vidya Malavde. Said to be a political drama, Bitter Rain will release some time in late-2006.

 ?I am working on many film projects at the same time. While Sujat will be directing this one, I will direct one of the other projects,? Prahlad told Metro.

 After a long time, the bearded Malayalam film-maker, who has been a favourite of Satyajit Ray and Mrinal Sen, will be in town with his bag of films. The festival on Adoor Gopalakrishnan, presenting his major films and documentaries, will stretch from December 12 to 23 at Nandan, to be followed up with a rendezvous with the man himself. 

The retrospective has been put in place by Seagull 

Foundation for the Arts in collaboration with the National Film of India 

(Pune), The Films Division and Nandan. 

 The festival fare will begin with Anantaram. Day II features Kalamandalam Ramkutty Nair and Swayamvaram, while Kalamamdalam Gopi and Kodiyettam will be screened on December 14. 

 Past in Perspective and Elippathayam are slated for December 15, while the next day showcases Yakshagana and Mukhamukham. There?s Krishnattam and Mathilukal on December 17, The Chola Heritage and Vidheyan on the 18th, Guru Chengannur and Kathapurushan on the 19th.

 Nizhalkkuthu will be shown on December 20 and Elippathayam on the 22nd. The festival will be wrapped with Anantaram again on December 23.

Catch Adoor in a rendezvous at Max Mueller Bhavan, 

6 pm, on December 21. He will meet film students at Seagull Arts and Media Resource 

Centre at 4 pm the day after.

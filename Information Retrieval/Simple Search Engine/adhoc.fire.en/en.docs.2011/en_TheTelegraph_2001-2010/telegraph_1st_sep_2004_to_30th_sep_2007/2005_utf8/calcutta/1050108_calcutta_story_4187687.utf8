The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Jingle all the way, years ago

 Revelry in the week around New Year?s Day thrived in 

British Calcutta. Sudeshna Banerjee explores the ball room and beyond

As calcutta present raises a toast to yet another 

round of revelry to ring in the New Year, it is time to turn the pages and take 

a peek at Calcutta Past; with chronicles of of European visitors serving as time 

machines.

Celebrations initially would take place in closed 

circles ? Old Court House, Government House, Great Eastern Hotel being prominent 

destinations; then they gradually spread to open spaces like the Maidan to include 

the man on the street.

The seat of governance

The Calcutta Gazette of January 1803 gives 

a detailed account of the illuminations and fireworks which formed part of a grand 

f?te, the first public entertainment held in Government House (Raj Bhavan), hosted 

by Lord Wellesley to commemorate the Peace of Amiens. The evening opened with 

a ball, drawing some 800 guests, including the judges of the Supreme Court, several 

natives of rank and the Danish Governor of Serampore. Lord Wellesley reached at 

10 o?clock. Soon after, dancing commenced, and continued till midnight. After 

that, the company proceeded to supper in the marble hall, where six ranges of 

tables were ?covered with a profusion of every delicacy?. ?The remarkable objects 

were a galley bringing the intelligence of the Peace: a frigate decorated with 

colours; some curious Egyptian obelisks covered with hieroglyphics, and a temple 

emblemetical of the Peace, and of the gallant exploits of our Naval and Military 

Commanders during the late war?? Supper was followed, at one o?clock, by illuminations, 

which rising in pyramidal forms 36 feet in height was continued to ?the Dhurromtolla 

on the left, and to the Chandpal Ghaut on the right?. The rockets discharged from 

the mortars of the Fort ramparts were a success, but for the fact that ?the populace 

stole much of the oil?, as one of the guests, Lord Valentia, complained.

The grand ball was the first of a long series of entertainments 

that the Governor House saw since then.

The dance floor

Those shaking a leg or two at the discos today may 

sample this from Kathleen Blechynden?s book Calcutta Past and Present, 

published exactly a century ago. ?Dancing was always a favourite amusement in 

Calcutta and the ladies being in the minority did their best to redress the balance 

by each dancing as many dances as they could possibly crowd into one night.? The 

dancing went on from nine pm till five am!

If a hangover is what you get after a night out at 

Tantra, in the early 19th century Calcutta the long-term after-effect would be 

consumption. Says Lord Valentia: ?Consumptions are very frequent among the ladies, 

which I attribute in a great measure to their incessant dancing??

Much of the dancing took place in Old Court House 

(giving its name to the street which houses the Great Eastern Hotel at present. 

It was demolished in 1792), which for over 30 years, was the scene of most public 

entertainments and assembly balls. ?Towards the close of the (18th) century the 

old house became unsafe; society, too, had begun to break up into classes, and 

subscription assemblies went out of fashion. Entertainments of every kind were 

transferred to private houses, and hosts, led by the Governor-General in his new 

and splendid Government House, gave weekly receptions, besides large dinner parties, 

balls, and f?tes.?

As Britain spent thousands of pounds on hostility 

in the World War, the Town Hall Christmas ball rallied around to raise funds, 

but for the war itself. A far cry from the call of relief.

biggest public festivity

At the races 

Racing was considered ?Calcutta?s biggest winter time 

attraction?, in the words of R.J. Minney, author of Round About Calcutta (1922). 

For months, women studied pictured lists from Piccadilly, searching for the right 

headgear and dress to wear at the Races. ?New milliner?s signs adorn the city?s 

streets, as short-lived as the flies, just for the Racing season. The Indian has 

unpacked his shawls of many colours only to sport it on the crowded course where 

the patterned shoulders work a mosaic that is hardly ever seen in a human picture.? 

People flocked here from the four corners of the world to enjoy the thrills and 

frills of racing. But it was the pleasant climate at this time that was considered 

the biggest draw.

Hotel high

Originally styled Wilson?s Hotel, the hotel had a 

custom to host Christmas Eve celebrations in the large central hall on the ground 

floor, which for that one special occasion, was dubbed the Hall of All Nations. 

?The hall,? writes Montague Massey in his 1918 book 

Recollections of Calcutta for over Half a Century, ?was beautifully decorated 

and festooned with flags of all nations and brilliantly illuminated. Shortly after 

dark, the whole of the elite of Calcutta society trooped in?? Confectionery and 

cakes of different designs and sizes made on the premises, bon bons, crackers, 

sweets and fancy articles suitable for presents were heaped there. Gifts and pleasantries 

were exchanged. When people left for dinner, it ?did not by any means bring the 

tamasha to a close, as later in the evening the elite of Dhurramtollah 

and Bow Bazaar made their appearance, the ladies decked out in all their gorgeous 

Christmas finery, and no doubt they enjoyed themselves as much as their more favoured 

and fortunate sisters of the haut ton.?

From the beginning of the 20th century, the Grand 

too caught on. The native princes from Cooch Behar to Kashmir descended upon the 

city and their visits were much written about.

On the stage

If food is the season?s flavour of Park Street today, 

it would have been the stage in the mid-19th century. Just as the Corinthian Theatre 

went to town with their stage show Cinderella (whose posters were said 

to have created a sensation), Lewis Theatre Royal trumpeted its production Blue 

Beard. Both drew full houses.

On the greens

The Maidan, since the late 19th century, was fast 

becoming the site for a veritable carnival. In Eastern Interludes: A social 

history of the European Community in India, R. Pearson inventories German 

circuses, pantomimes, opera and melodramas in Hindi and Bengali and much more. 

Professor Vaneck was casting a spell on viewers in his sorcerer?s robes. The decapitation 

trick was his pi?ce de resistance. The Bombay Theatre Company staged a 

Hindi Hamlet. Haamstom?s Circus pitched a huge tent and a stage outfit 

advertised: ?The Quaints, direct from the West End after 300 performances, including 

one before their majesties the King and the Queen.? 

Charley?s Aunt and Ibsen?s A Doll?s 

House were the picks of the season. There were ?bioscopes that worked by electricity?. 

Pearson writes: ?A whiff of adventure was also injected by Dr Simpson, the meteorologist 

who accompanied (Robert Falcon) Scott on his famous Antarctica expedition. (His) 

incredible experiences were unveiled... before Calcuttans on a chilly Christmas 

evening, with slides, illuminating his unique talk. At the same time, the electric 

bioscopes bared the ravages of the First World War.? 

On a shopping spree

In early 20th century, the confectioners were no less 

experimental than their counterparts a century later. A Monster Cake, created 

by a hotel, made the headlines, ?distinguished by its colossal proportions and 

civic decorations?. 

Hall amp; Anderson, Whiteway Ladlow and Army amp; 

Navy Stores bustled with shoppers. The showcase would store ?Algerian onyx with 

engraved gilt mounts, jewel caskets in rich silk velvet, ... silver-plated mounts,... 

ornamental ink stands, tourists? companions, oxidised tobacco jars...?

At the turn of the century, the Bengali plunged into 

the festivities of the Burra Din with the enthusiasm of their European counterparts. 

If the aristocrats thronged the departmental stores, the Calcuttans flocked to 

the Stuart Hogg Market (New Market). Pearson writes: ?Wardrobes were restocked 

with the latest European styles; from frameless American pince-nez to gramophones 

with conical horns, opera clocks, model hats, fur collarettes, manicure sets, 

pocket watch and Gladstone bags? seamsters raced with the clock stitching fashionable 

dresses (priced at Rs 30) for the hall and lev?e at Government House.?

As socialites crowded Firpo?s, Peliti and Wallace?s 

restaurants, Christmas was the balm that healed the scars of the wars. A catalogue 

of a classy store would read like this: Yorkshire pudding: Re 1 per pound, turkeys: 

Re 1 ? 8 annas, fowls: 12 annas, fruit and raisin cake with 5 lb almond: Rs 5. 

English beer and Scotch ?hardly hurt the pocket?.

By the river

At the stroke of midnight on December 31, the steamers 

would hoot to welcome the New Year, a practice followed even today. At the Man 

O? War jetty, by the Fort William, a warship would dock every New Year?s Day. 

Manned by British soldiers, the ship would be open to natives for a free dekko. 

Band parties would come marching up from Harrison Road to the European localities 

and play in front of houses of eminent citizens. A handsome bakshish would 

be the order of the night. This tradition continued till after Independence.

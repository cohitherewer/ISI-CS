 Brothers found murdered

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Two businessmen brothers were found murdered under Calcutta Chord Railway Bridge, at the crossing of Bombay Road and Delhi Road, in Bally, on Thursday morning.

 The brothers ? 57-year-old Subhas Dutta, a resident of Beleghata, and 45-year-old Sukumar, a resident of Madhyamgram ? were partners in Dutta Spring Iron Company. Both bodies bore multiple marks of assault and strangulation, said superintendent of Howrah police Akhil Roy.

 The Duttas were last seen on Wednesday evening, heading for the Jessop factory in Dum Dum in a goods-laden vehicle. ?The material was not delivered. After the bodies were discovered, we launched a search for the vehicle and it was found in a garage. The driver claimed he had met with an accident. We are interrogating the owner, the driver and his help,? said Roy.

 ?Both bodies bore marks of injury inflicted by a blunt weapon. Blood stains were found on several spots. Subhas was wearing a shirt, a sweater and trousers, while Sukumar was wearing only trousers. They were murdered probably for money and the goods,? said a police officer.

 Subhash left home around noon on Wednesday. He was supposed to visit a number of places, including a bank, in Howrah. He called up Sukumar late in the afternoon and asked him to meet him at a place in Howrah.

 As both failed to return even late at night, their families made frantic calls to friends and business associates. It was around 7 in the morning that they received a call from police, asking them to identify the bodies.

 ?He called me up yesterday evening and enquired about our daughter, who suffers from a nerve ailment. That was the last we heard from him,? said Arati, Subhas?s wife.

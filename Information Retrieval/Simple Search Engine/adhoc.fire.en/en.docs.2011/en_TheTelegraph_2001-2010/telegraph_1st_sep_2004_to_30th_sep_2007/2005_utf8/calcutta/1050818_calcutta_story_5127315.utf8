 Lindsay Lohan: On the fast track

 Ready to hit top gear

 A lot has been written about young singer Lindsay Lohan and her debut film. But the centre of attention in any Herbie movie is undoubtedly the free-wheelin? old-school Volkswagen beetle with a mind of its own. 

 Number 53?s career was launched by Walt Disney in 1969 with the film Herbie The Love Bug. Since then, the determined little car has featured in numerous films and TV shows through the 70s, 80s and 90s. He has now been rescued from the junkyard and is back to his old self, full throttle. 

 In the latest installment in the loveable series, Herbie: Fully Loaded, directed by Angela Robinson, Maggie Peyton (Lohan) is the new owner of Number 53. She puts the car through its paces as she hits the NASCAR circuit (the car rally segment in the US). This time, Herbie?s got some new tricks under his hood. 

 The cast includes former batman Michael Keaton as Maggie?s father, handsome Hollywood hunk Matt Dillon, as the number one racer Herbie helps Maggie beat, and comedian Breckin Meyer. If you?re looking for a few laughs and some family entertainment, join Herbie for the ride.

 Catch the film at all the multiplexes, this Friday onwards.

 The books are popular with kids around the world. The film was released last year. Now, Calcutta will get a chance to watch it on the big screen (although the DVD was out earlier this year). Lemony Snicket?s A Series of Unfortunate Events releases this Friday at the city?s cineplexes.

 The first in the series has the Baudelaire children orphaned when their parents die in a fire. Fourteen-year-old Violet, 12-year-old Klaus and baby Sunny are shunted around from guardian to guardian. 

 One of them is a distant relative, the evil Count Olaf (Jim Carrey) who is trying to steal the Baudelaires? fortunes, left to them by their parents. From when the tragedy strikes, a series of unfortunate events dogs the three children every day.

 In the background, narrating the story, is the shadowy figure of Lemony Snicket (voiced by Jude Law). In reality, the books are written by an American named Daniel Handler.

 Fresh artistic tidings

 The first contemporary Indian art movement began in Bengal, marking a shift from the classical European method of painting to oriental, indigenous styles. The ongoing exhibition of paintings, New Wave in Bengal Art, traces the journey of Indian art since then, with a special focus on emerging trends in the art of Bengal in recent times. Showcasing the best, newest and most unique works of art by artists of the new generation, the show witnesses Bengal art standing at the crossroads of heritage and modernity, tradition and global culture. Featuring works by 24 artists, including Partha Pratim Deb, Soma Chakravarty, Manjari Chakravarty (Patchwork; picture left), Debanjan Roy, Ashim Purkayastha, Amritah Sen, Reema Kundu, Jayanto Roy, Arpan Mukherjee and Debraj Goswami, among others, the show emphasises the eclectic quality of their paintings, which, perceptually different in thematic, linguistic and technical concerns, however, continue to rely heavily on the visual strategies of their predecessors. Curator: Pranabranjan Ray.

 Her second innings

 Mandira Bedi with Samir Soni in a moment from Anything But Love

 One fine day, a few years after their divorce, Seema and Anish bump into each other at a restaurant. That?s where Anything But Love, Mandira Bedi?s second stint on stage, begins.

 ?It?s an adaptation of Barry Creyton?s Double Act that has just two characters,? says Mandira. But that?s where the similarity with her first play, Laughing Wild, ends. Directed by Vikranth Pawar, this one?s an ?intelligent comedy? compared to the dark humour-laced Laughing?, uses bigger sets and is meant for a larger audience.

 Samir Soni, better known for his role in Jassi Jaissi Koi Nahin, shares stage space with Mandira in the new play. ?It?s a look at two months in the lives of these two, following the meeting after their divorce,? Mandira says. ?It?s a can?t-live-with can?t-live-without relationship. They?re really a good couple but a few minutes together and they start fighting.?

 Her character, Seema, post-divorce, is afraid of missing the bus. ?She fears growing old and not having a companion, so she marries a second time, though not really being in love.? It was only with the third performance of the play ? which just finished its eighteenth staging recently ? that Mandira was able to get under the skin of the character. 

 ?Samir and I were following two different approaches. While he was looking for the motivation behind every sentence that his character speaks, I was for getting the lines done first.?

 But between the second and third performances, she caught Michelle Pffeifer in One Fine Day, where she co-starred with George Clooney. ?Seema is probably closest to that character,? Mandira feels. Watching the film a couple of times helped, she adds.

 Besides ?big stages? in Mumbai, the play has been performed in Delhi and Chandigarh. ?The reviews have been quite good so far,? Mandira offers. 

 There are plans to take it to Chennai, Bangalore and Calcutta, but she has no idea when. ?As far as Calcutta is concerned, we are always planning but everything just doesn?t seem to come together. It?s either a problem of date or organisation.?

 There are several other projects that have kept her busy besides the play. ?My dial-in show on Sahara One will have a bigger set and one-hour duration. There will also be a celebrity guest every week.? 

 Shooting for Sony?s Fame Gurukul starts at the end of this month and her work with NGO Breakthrough on HIV/AIDS awareness continues. The music video promoting the campaign also features Mandira?s stage partner, Samir Soni.

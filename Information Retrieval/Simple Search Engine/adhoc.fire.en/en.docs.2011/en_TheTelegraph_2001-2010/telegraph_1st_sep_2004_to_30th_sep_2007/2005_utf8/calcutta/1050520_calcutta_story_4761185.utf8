 Court for trees in park off Victoria

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court has expressed its displeasure over the way the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) is constructing Citizens? Park in the grounds adjacent to the Victoria Memorial Hall.

 ?You call it a park? But where is the greenery? There are no trees,? Justice Ashok Kumar Ganguly and Justice Tapan Kumar Dutt observed. 

 ?The CMC was allowed to make the park to create a green buffer around the monument. But the powerful halogen lamps that light up the garden are of no good to the area. They are, in fact, harmful to the monument,? the judges pointed out.

 The bench asked the CMC to replace the halogen lamps in the garden. ?Please try to use solar lamps instead of the high-powered halogens and please plant trees in the garden,? the order said.

 The bench directed the civic authorities to file a compliance report on July 5, when the matter will come up for hearing again.

 In the second part of the order, the court asked the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC) to complete construction of the park at the southern end of Victoria Memorial. ?You are unnecessarily delaying the work. You will have to complete the job by June 30,? the court told the HRBC lawyer.

 Thursday?s order followed charges brought by environment activist Subhas Dutta, petitioner of the original case relating to pollution in the Victoria Memorial complex.

 Dutta said the CMC, in its Citizens? Park, had installed halogen lamps that were not environment-friendly.

 ?Moreover, the CMC has not bothered to plant trees in the garden,? he alleged. 

 He asserted that the court should ask the CMC to plant trees immediately. Judges had already passed several orders with regard to the development of the areas surrounding the memorial. ?But so far, the Victoria Memorial authorities have done nothing to save the structure,? he added.

 The National Environment Engineering Research Institute, in its report in 1992, had made some recommendations to save the structure from pollution. 

 ?Though 13 years have elapsed since, the management has not take a single step in this regard,? Dutta alleged.

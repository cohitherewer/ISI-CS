The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 ?Bebo baby, let?s go?

 They were first seen at the Mumbai hotspots together. Then, they were all over the film glossies. They even came together on the big screen. Next, they were (supposedly) caught tongue-tied on a prying mobile camera. And now, they are more open about it than ever before. In Dubai, away from the intruding shutters and lenses, Shahid Kapur and Kareena Kapoor seemed totally at home, being with each other.

 The twosome was first seen on Wednesday afternoon at the official media launch of the Global Indian Film Awards (GIFA). While the Akshay Kumars and Amrita Raos were there by 11.30 (it was supposed to start at 11), Kapoor and Kapur made it at the very last moment after noon and dashed straight to their respective seats at the media briefing. Even in the 30-odd minutes of the conference, Shahid and Kareena, separated by a sponsor representative, were bending low and chatting up every now and then.

 Once the official talk was done, the two stuck around for one-to-one sessions with the media. Even during those 20-odd minutes, their sights were constantly set on each other. While Kareena was her bindaas self, Shahid was more organised in expressing his thoughts.

 ?I was here for a 20-day shooting schedule just 10 days ago and will be back again after 10 days for another film,? said the young heartthrob. ?So Dubai is like home. And add the shopping bit, well it?s just great. I headed straight to the malls as soon as I arrived here but found they had closed for the day.?

 Kareena didn?t project herself as a shopping freak and chose to speak about her forthcoming movies. ?I am looking forward to my next release, Dharmesh Darshan?s Bewafaa opposite Akshay Kumar. Then there?s Satish Kaushik?s Milenge Milenge with Shahid.? 

If it was not the film talk, the clincher came in 

the form of a simple one-liner. Even as the media hounded the two, Shahid came 

up to Kareena and said: ?Bebo baby, let?s go to the room naa.? Open and 

no-holds-barred, it?s tough to imagine that the same people sued a publication 

for printing pictures which were obviously them and only them.

 And if you are still not convinced, this is Shahid?s official take on their relationship: ?She gives me a lot of emotional support. We may not get to meet or even talk all the time because of our tough shooting schedules but we both know that we are there for each other. So there is no question of insecurity.?

 With Dubai holidays like these, they shouldn?t be complaining.

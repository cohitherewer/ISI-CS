 Glimpses of German life

 One of the most influential and original authors of contemporary German photography, Stefan Moses concentrates on the life and character of the Germans in his works. Capturing through his lens the way of living and dispositions of native Germans, he has tried to sum up the national character of his countrymen across the spectrum of the social classes. His belief that every individual is a microcosm of society is reflected in his photographs, where he attempts to discover the layers of one?s personality by capturing one?s various moods and expressions at different moments and in different environments. Specialising in portraiture, Moses partly positions himself in the tradition of his predecessor, August Sander, retaining his uniqueness by virtue of his interest in versatile photographic subjects. Hosted by Goethe-Institut/Max Mueller Bhavan Calcutta and The Seagull Foundation for the Arts, Stefan Moses ? Deutsche Vita, the ongoing exhibition, has on show 46 selected photographs by Moses, providing an excellent overview of the range and variety of his work.

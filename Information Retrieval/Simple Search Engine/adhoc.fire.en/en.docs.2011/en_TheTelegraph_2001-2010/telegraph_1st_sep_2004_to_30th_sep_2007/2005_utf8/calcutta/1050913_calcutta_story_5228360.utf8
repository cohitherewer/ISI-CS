 All for love

 The Bengali adaptation of Eduardo de Filippos Filumena Marturano, Mrs. Soriano is a satirical comedy that clearly exposes male hypocrisy in matters of love and respecting its social commitments. In the play, Filumena, mistress and housekeeper to Domenico Soriano, is shocked and betrayed when she learns that middle-aged Soriano intends to marry a young, attractive and socially acceptable girl. Deeply hurt and offended by his total disregard for her abiding loyalty and service to him over the last 25 years, she decides to teach him a lesson. She pretends to be dying and begs Soriano to arrange for a deathbed marriage. Soriano readily agrees, knowing that she would die soon enough, leaving him free to marry once again. But, no sooner than the ceremony is over, the newly-wed bride jumps out of bed and Soriano realises that he has been tricked. More startling revelations follow thick and fast, ending with a climax in which the spirit of humanity and moral optimism shines through, and love finally prevails. Direction: Dolly Basu.

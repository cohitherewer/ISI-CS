The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Shoot-at-sight, not in our sight

 - City police gun down UP team mission to eliminate five gangsters

 PRONAB MONDAL

 Lawmen won?t be permitted to take matters into their own hands. That is the line police took with a Special Task Force from Uttar Pradesh that had come to town with a clear agenda: to eliminate in an encounter five criminals wanted in UP, now holed up in Calcutta.

 The task force was camping in the city but returned without any action on Saturday. While they did not share the names of the five criminals fearing that the information would be leaked to the suspects, they are believed to have been on the trail of associates of Bablu Srivastava and Chhota Shakeel, who apparently were in hiding in the Park Circus area.

 The team comprising six officers from Lucknow had arrived 10 days ago. ?They contacted us with the information that five criminals had been hiding in east Calcutta for the past three weeks,? said an officer of the detective department.

 The suspects had fled from hideouts in Mumbai, Lucknow and Varanasi, and are wanted in connection with a number of extortion, abduction and murder cases.

 The team first met Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner, detective department (I), who referred them to police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee when he was told about their intention to conduct an encounter. The team told the commissioner and other senior officers its mission was to ?eliminate? the criminals.

 But Mukherjee made it clear that he would not allow such an operation to be conducted in the city. Encounters by police from other states have been the cause of controversy in the past (see box). He said that if the team agreed, Calcutta Police would help it arrest the criminals and take them back to UP.

 The anti-rowdy squad was called in to help track the five criminals down. ?We provided them as much help as we could,? said Mukherjee. But the UP police officers wouldn?t share the names of the criminals with their local counterparts, making it difficult to track them down. The team went back empty-handed.

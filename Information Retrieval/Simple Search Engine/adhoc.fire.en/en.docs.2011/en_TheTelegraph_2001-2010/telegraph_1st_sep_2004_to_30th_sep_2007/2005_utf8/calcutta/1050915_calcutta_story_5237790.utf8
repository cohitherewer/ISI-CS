 Short films with an eye on the big picture is the essence of the Third Kalpanirjhar International Short Fiction Film Festival that gets underway on Friday at Max Mueller Bhavan.

 The five-day fare organised by Kalpanirjhar Foundation and Max Mueller Bhavan offers a bouquet of 60 shorts culled from Germany, France, Brazil, USA and India. The festival will be unveiled by film-maker Mrinal Sen, painter Jogen Chowdhury and percussionist Bikram Ghosh.

 Several film schools, including National Professional School for Sound and Image (Paris), Polish National Film School (Lodz), and Film and Television Institute of India (FTII), in Pune, are participating in the event.

 The inaugural evening is devoted to films categorised as comedy/black comedy, which includes Andreas Krein?s Nuts and Bolts, shown at Cannes 2003. Day II screens four shorts by city-based film-makers ? Aditya Basak, Chandan Bhaduri, Ruchir Arun and Sanjeet Chowdhury ? while diploma films from FTII fill up the second half of the day.

 A panel discussion on acting in the short fiction mode is slated for Day III, with Anjan Dutt, Ashok Viswanathan, Rangan Chakraborty and Koushik Sen as panelists. This will be followed by the highlight of the festival ? Prix Jeunesse Suitcase for Tsunami Victims. ?This package has been specially created to be screened in tsunami-affected areas. It is being shown in Calcutta for the first time,? said Kalpanirjhar managing trustee Sandip Ray.

 The tsunami segment features Cao Hamburger?s The Boy, the Slum and the Pan?s Lids, Andrzej Maleszka?s Jakub, Christina Schindler?s Pirates of the Gutter, Camiel Schouwenaar?s Puppety, Christina Schindler?s Anders Artig, Reza Shahmoradi?s Ponds of Mirror and Janet Perlman?s Dinner for Two. A bunch of seven shorts from Germany will also be screened on Sunday.

 With 13 films, France is the focus on Day IV. The concluding day showcases rarely seen short classics like Maya Deren?s Meshes of the Afternoon, two more from the National Film Archive of India, and a package on independent women film-makers from the US. The festival wraps up with a six-film retrospective from Polish National Film School, Lodz.

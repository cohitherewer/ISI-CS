 Diwali came early for Padma Thikadar. As early as October 28, when a 28-year-old man, the son she had lost 18 years ago, turned up at the doorstep and called out for her.

 ?I had never expected him to return. But when I saw him, I knew instantly that he was my child,? said Padma, disbelief writ large on her face. 

 The Thikadar family lives in the Lake slums. Deepak Thikadar had gone missing from there when he was barely 10 years old.

 ?I had gone out for work as usual. It was five in the evening when I came back. I could not find Deepak anywhere,? recounted Padma.

 She and her husband Gopal searched everywhere and lodged complaints with the police, but to no avail. Ultimately, the couple gave up. However, the three daughters and the younger son could never fill the void in their lives.

 Padma was taking a bath last Friday when the son returned. ?I came out and saw him standing near the door, calling for me. The face hadn?t changed at all. Soon, he began asking about the other members of the family,? recalled the smiling mother.

 The joy of reunion has overshadowed everything else for the Thikadars. But there are gaps in Deepak?s account of the past 18 years that are yet to be explained.

 Deepak claims he was kidnapped by a Bihari man and spent some time in Bihar before being rescued by a Sardar. ?Since then, I have been working as a khalasi for his truck service,? he said. He added that he had lived in several places in north India.

 According to Deepak, he used to miss his family at times, but decided to return only after he ?saw his mother in a dream recently?. He failed to provide satisfactory answers when asked how he came to Calcutta and why he had not returned earlier.

 Janak Singh, owner, Calcutta-Mohali Transport Fleet, said: ?Deepak has been working as a khalasi for us for the past 12 years. There are offices of several transport companies near our office on BT Road. Deepak used to work for all of us. But he never told us he was a Bengali from Calcutta. He always said that he was from Orissa. We had even named him Oriya.?

 Unable to cope with the kidnap trauma, Deepak could have gone into a ?dissociative state?, said psychiatrist J.R. Ram, explaining the missing links in the mystery of the missing boy.

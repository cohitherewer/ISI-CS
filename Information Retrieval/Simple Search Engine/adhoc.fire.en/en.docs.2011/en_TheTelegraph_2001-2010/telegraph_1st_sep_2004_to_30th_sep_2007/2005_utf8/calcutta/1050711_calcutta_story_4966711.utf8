 Three months after opening its flagship store in the heart of the city, the Giordano travel line has made its way to City Centre, in an attempt to capture the suburban market after Lindsay Street.

 We were not present in this part of town. City Centre has really changed the lifestyle of the people of Salt Lake and its adjoining areas, explained Sambit Panda, regional manager, Elite Brands, which has brought the international label to town. Major brands in this segment like Samsonite and VIP have a presence in the mall. So we thought a brand like Giordano will fare well here as well, he added.

 The merchandise includes strolley backpacks, ladies beauty cases, uprights, suitcases and business cases. The attractive range of luggage and other travel accessories is crafted from innovative fabrics in contemporary designs and styles. Most of it is made of peach polyester and suede-finish fabric. Denim too has been used in quite a few designs.

 The price pinch is between Rs 895 and Rs 6,500.

 The 540-sq-ft showroom is situated in F Block, near the INOX exit.

 The travel gear segment in the city has been pretty disorganised so far. With people becoming more and more lifestyle conscious, Giordano is targeting the upwardly mobile segment. The merchandise sold here is very vibrant, sleek and budget friendly, signed off Panda.

 Comfort call

 The Oberoi Grand has introduced a day spa package for women business travellers and Calcuttans till September 15.

 The spa, managed by the Banyan Tree and staffed by trained Thai therapists, is offering guests a comprehensive range of holistic therapies and treatments that include ayurvedic remedies, aromatherapy, Thai, Balinese, Indian and Hawaiian massages. Scrubs, wraps, facials and a full range of health, hair and beauty treatments complete the facilities at the spa.

 While the Oberoi spa is usually open only to guests of the hotel, this package is aimed at city women, too.

 To avail of the package, you will have to book yourself in as a day guest, with single occupancy priced at the rate of Rs 6,000 and double occupancy at Rs 8,500. 

 The package includes a one-hour massage, complimentary use of steam, sauna, spa facilities, the fitness centre and the swimming pool, along with a 20 per cent discount on food and beverages.

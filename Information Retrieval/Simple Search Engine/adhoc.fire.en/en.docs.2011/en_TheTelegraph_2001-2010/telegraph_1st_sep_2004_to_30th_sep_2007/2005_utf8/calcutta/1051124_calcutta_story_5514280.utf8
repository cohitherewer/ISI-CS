 Terror links under scanner

 - Bangla national without papers fails to explain stay in city 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The special branch of Calcutta Police has launched a probe into the alleged links of a Bangladeshi national, Johur Alam, with gangs operating in West Asia. 

 Police are also verifying whether the 50-year-old, arrested in the Rajmohan Street area on Tuesday night, was a member of any Bangladesh-based terrorist outfit.

 Alam was picked from a guest house on Rajmohan Street, under Jorasanko police station, for failing to provide documents supporting his stay in India. 

 He had put up in the guest house since his arrival from Mumbai on November 15. Alam was booked under the Foreigners? Act and on Wednesday remanded in police custody for 10 days.

 ?Based on specific information, we raided the hotel last night and arrested him. Besides not having the relevant papers, he also failed to explain the purpose of his stay in the country. There are reasons to doubt his statements and authenticity of the address of his Mumbai residence that he had provided,? said Pradip Kumar Chatterjee, deputy commissioner of police (special branch).

 ?We are also verifying whether he has links in West Asia or with any Bangladeshi terrorist outfit. Right now, nothing more can be disclosed,? the deputy commissioner added. 

 Sources said a team from the special branch would leave for Mumbai on Thursday to verify Alam?s statements.

 A resident of Chittagong, in Bangladesh, Alam had crossed over into India almost 15 years ago and moved in with one of his acquaintances in Mumbai. After a short stint in a shipping firm as a cleaner, Alam reportedly worked with some leather traders in Zaveri Bazar. 

 Investigations reveal that around six years ago, he left for Qatar to work for an oil company. ?From Qatar, every alternate month, Alam would send across money, running into lakhs, to his son in Bangladesh. It is still not clear whether the money was meant for his family or for a terrorist body. He claims to have returned to India from Qatar on an Indian passport, which he can?t produce,? said an officer.

 During his stay in India, Alam has visited Calcutta on several occasions. Sleuths believe that he was possibly trying to use the city as a transit point to cross over into Bangladesh. 

 Alam has told the cops that he was waiting for a call from his son in Bangladesh.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Red rally wave to swamp the road 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The city is set to come to a halt on Saturday, with the ruling Marxists mobilising a million people to converge on Brigade Parade Grounds, for the opening session of the CPM?s state conference.

 As the rally is scheduled to start at 1 pm, all major roads, from Tallah to Tollygunge, from Salt Lake to Howrah, will be under the sway of the rallyists from 10 am.

 There is little chance of normal traffic movement being restored before the evening, as the rallyists will return home only after the event ends around 4 pm.

 Seven major processions will originate from Howrah bridge, Shyambazar, Sealdah station, the Park Circus connector, Ballygunge station, Tollygunge tram depot and Behala.

 All processions will terminate at the Brigade after traversing several thoroughfares. This apart, at least 100 small and medium-size processions will take to the streets from different areas to join the main processions.

 It will be the largest turnout organised by the CPM after Justice Amitava Lala?s judgment restricting rallies and processions so as not to inconvenience commuters.

 Though the mandarins of Alimuddin Street have issued directives to party units not to disrupt traffic movement and walk along one side of the road, they are not too sure that the orders will be followed, as each procession is expected to be several thousand-strong.

 The CPM has, for the first time, issued a circular with an eight-point directive (in tune with Justice Amitava Lala?s judgment) to all party units on holding processions.

 Apart from keeping one side of the road free for vehicular movement, the procession and the vehicles carrying the Brigade-bound crowds will have to stop at intersections to allow vehicles to pass.

 The processions are expected to swamp Strand Road, Babughat, Eden Gardens, CR Avenue, Chowringhee and JL Nehru Road. AJC Bose Road, Moulali and SN Banerjee Road will not be spared, either. 

 The same holds true for the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, bridge no.4, Park Circus, Circus Avenue, Beckbagan, AJC Bose Road, Rabindra Sadan, Birla Planetarium, all major roads near Gariahat, Deshapran Sashmal Road, Diamond Harbour Road and Kidderpore Road.

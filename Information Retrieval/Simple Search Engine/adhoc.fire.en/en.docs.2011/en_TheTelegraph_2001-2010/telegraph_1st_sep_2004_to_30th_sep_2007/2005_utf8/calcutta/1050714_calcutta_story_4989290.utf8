 Will a film release on cable TV be more profitable than a commercial release? Is the small screen grabbing more eyeballs than the big screen? Sahara One will probably have all the answers by August-end, well ahead of the time frame it has set to test the waters with its novel concept.

 The channel has started airing feature films (all produced by Sahara One Motion Pictures) on TV before their commercial release on the special Friday Release slot at 8.30 pm to ?reach 60 million homes through cable and satellite television?. The scheme was kicked off on June 10 with Vikas Desai?s Hum Jo Keh Na Paaye, starring Abhijit Sanyal, Anupam Kher and Gauri Karnik.

 ?In the West, the producer and the director decide if a film should have a commercial, a TV or a DVD release. This is a format we are trying to introduce in India. It?s a well-thought-out effort. TV has scientific buying, so advertisers will come and hence the revenue. TV can give more returns than a commercial release. And if the objective is to entertain the masses, then TV is an obvious choice,? Sahara One chief operating officer Purnendu Bose told Metro.

 Directors of some of the films aired have reportedly been caught unawares by the channel?s release move. Of them is Tanuja Chandra, whose Film Star starring Mahima Chaudhary, Priyanshu and Vasundhara Das is high on the Friday Release list.

 ?The directors don?t have a reason to disagree because we are giving their films so much publicity and push. These days there is very low turnout at theatres and most films are flops. And not releasing it on TV has led to piracy. I guess the scheme was overdue. We have 13 films lined up one after the other. All these have a budget ranging between Rs 4 and Rs 10 crore. It?s just an experiment for which we have set three months,? said Bose.

 But the initiative seems to have already run into rough weather, despite being armed with a ?three-month inventory?. The first show was followed up on three successive weeks by Raj Bharat?s Tum Ho Na, starring Riya Sen, Jackie Shroff and Nethra Raghuraman, Sravani Deodhar?s Pehchaan, featuring Raveena Tandon, Vinod Khanna and Rati Agnihotri, and Basu Chatterjee?s Prateeksha, with Jimmy Shergil, Dia Mirza and Anupam Kher.

 The fifth week, on July 8, fell through due to ?unavoidable reasons?, according to a source. The July 15 slot remained uncertain till Wednesday evening.

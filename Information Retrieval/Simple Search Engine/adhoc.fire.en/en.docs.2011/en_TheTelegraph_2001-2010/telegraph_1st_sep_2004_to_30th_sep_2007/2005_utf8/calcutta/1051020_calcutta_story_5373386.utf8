 Subrata pools in death row

 The twin swimming pools on the Southern Avenue boulevard ? perhaps the city?s ugliest eyesore ? will be demolished, as preliminary investigations have established that they had been set up ?illegally by former Trinamul Congress mayor Subrata Mukherjee?.

 Following a demand by several mayoral council members at a meeting last month to demolish the pools, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya had asked municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay to probe the legality of the structures. 

 Bandyopadhyay admitted that he had been assigned with the probe, but refused to divulge the findings.

 Mayoral council member (roads) Tuhin Bera said a departmental probe had revealed that former mayor Mukherjee had used special powers under Section 37 of the CMC Act to set up the pools ? each 3,000 sq ft ? at a cost of Rs 80 lakh. 

 ?He did not allow the issue to be placed before the council for ratification. Nor did he call a house meeting later to have the proposal approved.?

 According to Bera, the mayor could invoke Section 37 only to tackle an emergency, like repairing an artery that has suddenly subsided. ?Construction of a swimming pool is definitely not within the purview of Section 37.?

 Hinting at a nexus between the civic authorities and the contractor who built the pools, Bera said the contractor had received his payment, while several others were still awaiting payment for work done in the 2004-2005.

 He alleged that the swimming pools had turned out to be a major traffic hazard. ?Police and the civic roads department were not consulted by the former mayor.?

 A delegation of local residents had met mayoral council member (parks and gardens) Faiyaz Ahmad Khan and demanded the immediate demolition of the structures. ?What did Subrata Mukherjee exactly give us ? two swimming pools or an accident-prone zone?? demanded Sandip Banerjee, a member of the delegation.

 The former mayor, however, is not the least bothered about the fate of the pools. ?The pools are civic property and it is up to the board to decide whether to demolish them or convert them into stables,? Mukherjee told Metro. 

 Trinamul?s Javed Ahmed Khan, leader of the Opposition in the civic house, said: ?We have all along been demanding demolition of the encroachments on the boulevard for the safety of pedestrians. A pedestrian may get run over any time because of the pools.? Khan had been a member of Mukherjee?s council.

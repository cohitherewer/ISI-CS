The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Votes for classical notes

 Ustad Zakir Husain with Pandit Shiv Kumar 

Sharma and his son Rahul in the city to perform at the Sabrang Sangeet Sammelan 

last year

Nightlong soirees, non-stop music. For Calcuttans, 

the two is a dream combination triggering a mad scramble for passes every winter. 

It?s not the rock ?n? roll acts we are referring to, but pure classical music, 

with Amjad Ali Khan and Amaan Ali Bangash on sarod, Shiv Kumar Sharma on santoor, 

Hariprasad Chaurasia on flute, Shahid Parvez on sitar, and vocals by Jasraj and 

Ajoy Chakraborty.

A week before the Dover Lane Music Conference gets 

underway with musicians old and young, the Sabrang Sangeet Sammelan will host 

a rare gathering of exponents in vocals and instruments.

The Sammelan, into its sixth year, features vocal 

recitals by Pandit Ajoy Chakraborty, Sruti Sadolikar and Sanjukta Ghosh, Shahid 

Parvez and son Shakir Khan on sitar, and Anindya Chatterjee with son Anubrata 

on tabla. The nightlong soiree is slated for January 15 at Kala Mandir.

The Sammelan is organised by the Sabrang Music Trust, 

constituted in memory of Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan in 1999. ?Bade Ghulam Ali 

Khan was a connoisseur of food and his favourite dish was biryani cooked in ghee 

brought from Lahore. All those who visited him in the morning were treated 

to a plateful of biryani,? reminisces Ajoy Chakraborty.

As the Ustad was known for his philanthropic activities, 

the trust has decided to adopt a twin strategy of promoting classical music and 

extending free medical aid to aged artistes. Those lent a helping hand by the 

trust include the late VG Jog and AT Kanan.

Along with the medical facility, the trust has also 

revived the Sabrang Sangeet Sammelan started by Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan?s son 

Munawar in 1970. The music meet now acts as a fundraiser for the expenses borne 

by the trust.

?I became associated with the trust last year and 

felt it was working for a very noble cause. So, this year, I decided to help them 

financially and also by giving mileage. The tickets will be priced between Rs 

50 and Rs 100,? says Sanjay Budhia, managing director, Patton International.

Once the Sammelan winds up, the stage will be set 

for the four-day-long 53rd Dover Lane Music Conference at Nazrul Mancha. 

?This season, the emphasis is on the sitar. Among 

star artistes this year are Ustad Amjad Ali Khan, Pandit Jasraj, Pandit Hariprasad 

Chaurasia and Shahid Parvez. L. Shankar has cancelled his participation for personal 

reasons, and been replaced by violinist M.S. Gopalkrishnan,? says governing body 

general secretary Nupur Mukherjee, adding: ?We haven?t included dance in this 

year?s meet, as we plan to organise a dedicated festival later.?

Winners of the talent search contest conducted by 

the Dover Lane Music Conference will be feted at the inaugural session.

Brushstrokes rare and real

Phase two of Winter?s Tale, a series of three exhibitions 

being organised by Gallery Katayun in Auckland Place, features a rare pen-and-ink 

drawing by Benode Behari Mukherjee, whose centenary is being celebrated this year. 

It is a curious work in which Ganesha is portrayed as Bal Gopal, crawling on his 

knees with his trunk setting him apart from the child who was born in a prison 

but was raised in Mathura. Words to this effect are scribbled in English at one 

corner of the tiny piece of paper on which the sensuous lines were drawn.

There is another minuscule drawing by Jamini Roy, 

a masterpiece in red and green which has the word Magadhi written next to it in 

Bangla. According to the Bengali dictionary, it is the name of a dialect that 

was perhaps spoken in the ancient capital of Magadh. But what significance this 

word has in this context is unknown.

Ved P. Sandip is an unknown name in Calcutta but in 

his two paintings in black and white with contrasting red strokes he comes across 

as an artist with a highly individual and minimalist vision. His wit flashes as 

he uses sections of a pair of scissors and a safety razor blade in one work. He 

does have the courage to hold his own.

Bikash Bhattacharjee presents an early portrait of 

a woman with stern features. Age has left its mark on the surface. This is complemented 

by a profile by Lalu Shaw. There are angular faces by Paresh Maity and a vase 

with fleshy blooms by Shuvaprasanna. The watercolours of the statue of the monarch 

with the Victoria Memorial Hall swathed in mist by Sudip Roy and those of a sun-drenched 

alley in Calcutta by Tapas Kanti Mitra are just about competent.

In a small painting, Aditya Basak juxtaposes the well-known 

pata of the voluptuous courtesan playing the violin with an obviously contemporary 

scene ? an essay in post-modernism, perhaps a little late in the day. Nature looks 

fresh as ever and unspoilt without verging on the sentimental in a large painting 

by Ganesh Haloi. It is amazing how the artist?s images never look tired although 

he has been working on the same theme for years. The exhibition continues till 

next Sunday.

Bengal beckons Rinke: From sasurbari 

to big screen

Even before the city picks up her trail, this younger 

daughter of Dimple Kapadia breezes in and out of her south Calcutta home (that?s 

where her in-laws live). But Urmi Chakraborty?s next film ? after Hemanter 

Pakhi ? may find Rinke Khanna staying put for a long time, and in full public 

glare. ?Rinke is willing to do a Bengali film. She will play a university student 

in my script based on a story by Bani Basu,? said Urmi, all set to start before 

summer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Court?s man for Ramsar razing

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The demolition heat on the wetlands reached boiling point on Monday, with Calcutta High Court appointing a special officer to oversee action against the blacklisted housing projects in the Ramsar zone.

 ?Special officer Biswajit Mukherjee will oversee and supervise the court order, dated November 15, asking the construction companies to demolish the structures that have allegedly come up on the East Calcutta Wetlands,? said the division bench of Justice Dilip Kumar Seth and Justice Soumitra Pal.

 But the demolition men will not swing into action immediately. The court made it clear that the special officer would not assume office before January 1, 2006.

 ?We also desire that the state government or any of its agencies will not start the demolition work till January,? the judges added.

 Sanjeevani Projects Private Limited and the Ideal Group ? the construction companies whose complexes are to come under the axe ? have time till December 31 to move the Supreme Court if they challenge the high court order.

 When contacted by Metro, Mukherjee, senior law officer of West Bengal Pollution Control Board, said he was yet to receive the court order. Mukherjee is also the court-appointed special officer for controlling noise pollution in the state.

 The state had moved a petition on Monday, praying for appointment of a special officer to oversee and supervise the demolition work. 

 The officer will also have to see that the developers restored the site to its earlier condition.

 On November 15, this division bench had ordered the promoters to demolish the structures and convert the area into a wetland so that pisciculture could be possible again.

 For the constructions in the Kochpur area, under Bantala police station, the promoters had obtained permission from the Bamangachhi gram panchayat. While granting permission, the panchayat had allowed the companies to change the character of the land. According to officials, most of the 60 acres had already been filled up.

 The pollution control board, in an affidavit to the division bench, has stated that neither Sanjeeva Town nor Green Valley Towers had obtained the no-objection certificate from the green watchdog.

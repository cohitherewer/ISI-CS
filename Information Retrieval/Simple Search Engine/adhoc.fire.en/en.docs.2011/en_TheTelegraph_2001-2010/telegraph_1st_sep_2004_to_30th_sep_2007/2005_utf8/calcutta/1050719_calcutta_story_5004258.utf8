 Challenging social norms

 Social by nature, man has been instinctively driven towards forging inter-personal relationships, that served as the stepping stone of modern society and civilisation. However, the various complex rules of society, framed from the beginning of human history, have gradually made him immune to the finer aspects of life. The rigidities of social order make us regard any aberration from established conventions with suspicion and aversion, often without attempting to view the matter from an unbiased, neutral perspective. Thus, in Sayak?s Daibaddha, Gagan, Sita and their daughter, Jhinuk, find themselves confronted by an antagonistic society that refuses to accept them as a family like any other. Uncomfortable questions are raised about the so-called unnatural alliance of the trio, who are made to suffer deep humiliation and are finally alienated from society?s mainstream. Yet, when the victims challenge the rusted tenets of society, which itself is crumbling, the veteran guardians of social decorum fail to provide any satisfactory answer. Direction: Meghnad Bhattacharya.

 He has been experimenting with aboriginal art forms for some time now, and jewellery designer Somit Dass latest innovation is a line of ornaments influenced by the fishnet weaving technique used by the tribes of Bihar.

 Das, who has been working closely with tribals from various areas of Bengal and Bihar, spent some time in a remote village in Dumka. I observed the way the tribals weave fishnet. I have used the same technique to make jewellery, explains Das, who sells out of his Behala home. 

 The designer has replaced the iron chips used in the fishnets with brass beads of the finest quality. These golden beads are strung together in the fishnet method to make neckpieces, earrings and wristbands, priced at Rs 150 and above for a set.

 Das has also experimented with a range of hand-painted pinewood jewellery. Colourful motifs ? tribal, animal and abstract ? are painted on blocks of wood and shaped into pendants and earrings.

 Pinewood, unlike most other varieties of wood, is very light and hence makes for comfortable wear. Also, I have used seasoned wood, which makes the jewellery washable and durable, he adds. These sets are priced between Rs 75 and Rs 100.

 Dabbling in terracotta, wood and bone, Dass next venture will be a line of rosewood jewellery. I have always drawn influences from tribal jewellery. My aim is to keep these unique art forms alive, he signs off.

 Buffet binge

 Orkos in City Centre is kicking off a lunch buffet with an eye on Sector Vs rumbling tummies. The primarily Indian spread is meant for the Saltlec power lunch crowd.

 We are targeting the large IT community of Salt Lake that often entertains international guests. For them, sampling some authentic Indian cuisine may be a good idea, says Orkopol Sen, the man behind the well-appointed eatery.

 Priced at Rs 225, the buffet includes salad, two non-vegetarian dishes, three vegetarian options, a choice of breads, two kinds of rice and dessert. It also features a few select Chinese dishes.

 The buffet is especially suitable for the executive in a hurry to finish lunch. But we also intend to include a pint of beer with the package to ensure they relax, adds the young restaurateur.

 The buffet will be laid out through the week, between 12.30 pm and 3.30 pm.

 Summer cool

 Fabindia has launched its Summer Cool Collection of garments and home furnishings at its 16 Hindustan Park store.

 New colours and weaves have been launched in bed, table and bath linen. The colours vary from very pale pastels to bright hues of Indian summer.

 In an endeavour to integrate indigenous embroidery and weaving techniques with contemporary designs, there is a small selection of Lucknow chikankari and chanderi. Chikan work has been used in Indian and western wear, both for men and women. The prices range between Rs 380 and Rs 1,400.

 Chanderi, a very fine weave of cotton, silk thread and zari from Madhya Pradesh, has been used for shirts, tops and kurtas of varying lengths in trendy designs, and will set you back by Rs 380 to Rs 820.

 The linen garments are priced between Rs 380 and Rs 675.

 Summer is all about soothing colours and comfortable fabrics. Chikan and chanderi are a hit in summer, explains Pallabi Basu, store manager.

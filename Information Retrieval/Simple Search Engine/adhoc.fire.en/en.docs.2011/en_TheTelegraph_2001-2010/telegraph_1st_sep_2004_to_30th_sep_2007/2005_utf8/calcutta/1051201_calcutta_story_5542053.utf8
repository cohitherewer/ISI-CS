 Bank heist bags Rs 140

 - Novice gang fails to open safe, makes do with manager wallet

 A STAFF REPORTER

 They invaded a bank dreaming of lakhs ? or, possibly, crores ? but ended up being richer by just Rs 140. The only serious casualty in the operation was an injured manager.

 Without a clue about how to crack open a bank safe, a gang planned a heist on Wednesday morning. Armed with a revolver and a dagger, two youths entered the New CIT Road extension counter of Indian Overseas Bank, posing as account-holders. 

 They held the bank manager at gunpoint, snatched the keys to the iron chest from him and succeeded in reaching the treasure trove. 

 They tried to open it, but could not. Frustrated, they tied up the manager, took out his wallet and left with their loot: Rs 140.

 ?The operation was being executed professionally, but the youths had no idea how to open a bank safe,? said Ajoy Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (central division). ?They did not know that two keys are required to open it. They snatched one from the manager, but the other was with the cashier, who had not turned up by then.?

 It was around 9.15 am when manager Benuranjan Das opened the bank. As soon as he closed the main gate, two youths arrived and sought entry. Das told them to come after 10 am, but the youths said they had a high-value cheque to clear and that they wanted to fill up the deposit form in the safety of the bank. 

 As soon as they stepped in, one of them whipped out a revolver and the other a dagger. ?I was alone. They forced me to lead them to the safe. With the revolver aimed at my temple and the dagger pressed against the cheek, I hardly had an option,? Das told police. 

 ?The duo struggled for 15 minutes, but could not open the safe. They then asked me to open it. I told them that unless I had the other key, I could not open the locker. But they did not believe me,? he added. 

 At this point, the dagger was pressed so hard that Das started bleeding.

 The youth then assaulted the manager and tied his hands and legs. ?They snatched the wallet from his trouser pocket and took out the money. While they were leaving the bank, another employee turned up. He, too, was overpowered,? deputy commissioner Kumar said.

 A preliminary probe suggests another duo was standing guard outside the bank. ?The robbers? style of operation indicates that they had never looted a bank before,? Kumar added.

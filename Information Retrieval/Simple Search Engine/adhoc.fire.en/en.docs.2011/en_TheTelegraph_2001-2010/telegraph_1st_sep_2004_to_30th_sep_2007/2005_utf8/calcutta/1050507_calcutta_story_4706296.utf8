 Sights set on rain farming

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s government is all set to enact legislation to stop depletion of the groundwater reserves in and outside Calcutta. 

 Government pleader Rabilal Moitra told the high court on Friday about this decision while hearing a plea seeking a court directive to entrepreneurs on harvesting rainwater for industries.

 Moitra said rainwater harvesting was going to be made compulsory and the state would compel commercial firms using groundwater to go in for rainwater harvesting.

 The government was contemplating amending the Municipal Act to make it compulsory to provide for rainwater harvesting in buildings in the municipal areas. 

 ?The state government should also ensure timely inspection and rigid control on the quality of soft drinks,? the division bench of Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice Ashok Kumar Ganguly said.

 This is not a rare bird, nor is this a particularly beautiful one. But the Greater Racket-tailed Drongo does have one unique feature. As the name suggests, it?s the tail. And for the first time, there has been a recorded sighting in Calcutta.

 This feathered creature?s extended tail is two-pronged, with streamers at the end. A little tuft of feathers sticks out on the top of its head. 

 The small bird is indigenous to Bengal, particularly in the north, where there are plenty of trees, and is now making its city debut. 

 ?This bird, better known as Bhimraj in India, is quite common in North Bengal, where there are thick forests and lots of vegetation, because it feeds on fruits and insects,? explains Sumit Sen, a member of kolkatabirds.com, a bird-watcher group. ?It is a fairly regular migrant, but there has not been a sighting of it in the city, at least not on record. This is a first.?

 The tale of the solitary winged wonder began when it was spotted by an amateur bird-lover on the National Library grounds early in December last year. 

 She promptly informed some avid bird-watchers. A few, including Sen and friend Sujon Chatterjee of Prakriti Sansad, then set out in search of the little black bird, cameras in hand.

 The Greater Racket-tailed Drongo prefers well-wooded areas, but sticks to the fringes, near human habitation. It has so far not ventured within city limits. ?I know at least six people who have spotted the bird at National Library more than once. So, it?s definitely there,? adds Sen.

 ?There?s only one bird. It moves around, but keeps returning to the same spot on the grounds around the same time every day, early in the morning,? says Sen, of the bird that makes a variety of loud noises, especially in the mornings. 

 He attributes the arrival of the Drongo in the city to the increase in the number of trees. ?There are more people and more buildings. But I think there are more trees, too. Although the number of migratory birds this winter has fallen, a few species have either come for the first time or returned after a long absence,? he signs off.

 Meanwhile, bird-lovers are busy conducting a survey in Santragachhi, to keep tabs on this winter?s numbers. 

 On Saturday, NGOs and government officials had descended on the jheel in a joint effort.

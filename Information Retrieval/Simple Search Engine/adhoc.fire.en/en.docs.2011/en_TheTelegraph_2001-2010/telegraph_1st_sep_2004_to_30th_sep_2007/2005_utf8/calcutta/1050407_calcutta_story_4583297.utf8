 Pre-poll upsets in wards

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Four prominent Trinamul Congress councillors will have to change their seats in the June 19 polls as the state election commission on Wednesday released a list of wards that have been reserved for either women or Scheduled Caste candidates.

 The Trinamul councillors to be affected by the order are Paresh Pal (ward 31), Mantu Sanyal (ward 34), Partha Bose (ward 40) and Anil Mukherjee (ward 73). 

 Mukherjee is chairman of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. Pal, also an MLA, and Sanyal are considered close to party supremo Mamata Banerjee.

 The CPM, too, has not been left unscathed. Salil Banerjee (ward 7) will have to shift to another constituency, as his ward has been reserved for a woman councillor. 

 Other party councillors to be affected are Jahar Gupta (ward 28), Chhaya Banerjee (ward 3) and Dilip Mandal (ward 37). Banerjee?s ward has been reserved for a Scheduled Caste representative.

 The Trinamul and the CPM both have announced their mayoral candidates but have failed to finalise the list of other candidates. 

 While the Trinamul is seeking a second term for mayor Subrata Mukherjee, the CPM is projecting Bikash Bhattacharjee, former advocate-general of Tripura, as the mayoral candidate.

 Green board vs decibel demons

 - Five-year jail, penalty of Lakh

 Not quite what the PCB patrol teams found during their tours. A Telegraph picture

 For the first time, the state pollution control board (PCB) has decided to follow up cases of noise-ban violation and book the offenders.

 The move comes in the wake of findings of the patrol teams that toured the city a day before and on Kali puja. The PCB will now initiate proceedings in accordance with the pollution norms against those caught/accused of bursting banned crackers.

 According to Environment Protection Act, 1986, if proven guilty, an offender can face imprisonment up to five years and a penalty of Rs 1 lakh. So far, the board has booked manufacturers and sellers, and hence, curbed open sale of the banned crackers. Now, it has shifted focus to the buyers and users.

 ?We have compiled a detailed report on the basis of the findings of our patrol teams. The matter has also been discussed at the highest level. The board will now call for a hearing of the accused, as per legal provisions,? claimed Biswajit Mukherjee, a senior law officer of PCB.

 The PCB ?observers? who toured the city were clearly rattled by the level of noise pollution in various pockets of the city. While on the first day PCB had pressed into service seven teams, the day after ? alarmed at the frightening observations ? added eight more teams to do the rounds of residential areas. The reports left the top brass stumped.

 ?The most affected areas were parts of Salt Lake, Ballygunge, Bhowanipore, Beleghata and Dum Dum. While in some cases we managed to reach the spot almost immediately after receipt of a complaint, in others, we went later and found that the local residents had a lot to protest about against the incessant bursting of banned crackers. ?These observations will serve as ?circumstantial evidence? for us,? said a PCB member.

 Among the teams that visited various areas of the city, the most disconcerting were the findings of a three-member committee that made surprise checks at some of the reputed medical colleges and hospitals. The team was appalled to find that the level of noise pollution on the premises of these no-noise zones made a mockery of the rules.

 The team?s first stop was SSKM Hospital, where the employees and their relatives were organising a puja. They were playing loudspeakers at an ear-splitting volume and were busy bursting banned crackers. The team seized the fireworks and handed over the secretary of the puja committee, Shyam Mallik, to the police. At NRS Medical College, too, a puja was being held. Crackers were burst without check.

 The PCB members pointed at the police for failing to stop the inflow of banned crackers into the city. But the cops countered that it was almost impossible to keep track of those who bought crackers in small quantities and carried them around in their pockets. ?We can check lorries and raid shops that store these banned crackers. But what can we do about those who keep the crackers in their houses?? reasoned an officer of Burrabazar police station.

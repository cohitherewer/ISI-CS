The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Come, study and stay in star hostel 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 An air-conditioned hostel with three-star facilities will lure foreign students to universities in the city.

 The government, on an overdrive to market four institutions abroad, is aware that despite the excellence of some of the courses on offer, foreign students shy away from the state primarily because of the lack of ?proper? accommodation facilities.

 The proposed hostel, to be set up in Salt Lake, is a bid to redress the issue. Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur, has been asked to draw a plan for the hostel, higher education minister Satyasadhan Chakraborty told the Assembly on Monday.

 The institutions identified as having the potential to attract foreign students are Jadavpur University, Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur, Calcutta University and Rabindra Bharati University.

 The government is encouraging them to take part in education fairs abroad and highlight the ?uniqueness of their courses? and the ?richness of their faculty?. 

 ?Correspondence with several foreign universities has revealed that some of the courses offered by our universities and technological institutions can draw students from abroad,? minister Chakraborty said.

 N.R. Banerjea, vice-chancellor of the Shibpur campus, said the US was one of the prime targets. He was confident that US students could be drawn to the state if ?we adopt the right marketing strategy?.

 According to him, several faculty members in some of the best institutions in the US and the UK are from Calcutta. ?We can have a good number of students from these countries if we can convince them that the same teaching standards are being maintained here,? claimed the minister,

 Not just engineering. Shyamapada Pal, member of the state higher education council, said some of the humanities courses offered by Calcutta and Rabindra Bharati universities have ?tremendous potential? to attract foreign students.

 Another factor the government wants to exploit is the fees ? much less than what foreign students pay in their own countries. ?It is one of our biggest advantages. We plan to charge a foreign student between $3,000-5,000 a year,? an official said.

 Apart from the US and UK, the other countries the government intends to target are Mauritius, Korea, Iran, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal and some in Africa.

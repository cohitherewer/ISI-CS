 Chrysalis to butterfly. Girl next 

 door to next supermodel? call it what you will. The second 

 edition of Channel [V]?s Get Gorgeous transformed 

 another ordinary young girl into a beauty queen.

 This year?s winner, unveiled in 

 the final episode of Get Gorgeous 2 on Saturday, 

 is a 21-year-old engineering student from Pune, Priyanka 

 Shah. ?I come from an academic background and modelling 

 was an unlikely career choice,? shares Priyanka. The student 

 of MIT Women?s Engineering College had not watched the contest 

 in its first year and knew little about it when she took 

 the plunge.

 ?I had done the odd fashion show 

 in the college circuit but it wasn?t anything serious. My 

 friends forced me to go for the auditions.? Her frank answers 

 at the auditions, she feels, helped her make the first shortlist. 

 ?They asked me if given a chance I would choose modelling 

 or engineering. I chose engineering.?

 A panel of judges, comprising 

 models Milind Soman, Noyonika Chatterjee and designer Hemant 

 Trevedi, travelled six cities and sifted through 5,000 entries 

 before selecting Priyanka as one of the 16 finalists. They 

 were then flown to Sri Lanka for a grooming session and 

 lots of fashion shoots.

 ?I was clearly the odd one out 

 among the contestants when we left for Sri Lanka,? Priyanka 

 laughs. The national Netball girls? team-member also felt 

 she was ?more athletic? and needed to tone down to ?look 

 a little delicate?.

 A public scolding by the grooming 

 experts took her closer to achieving that. ?It was embarrassing 

 but it helped me concentrate and work hard on reducing weight 

 and inches.?

 Her dedication is the first thing 

 that both Archana Vijaya ? last year?s winner and this year?s 

 show host ? and Channel [V] head Amar K. Deb mention while 

 discussing Priyanka. ?The way she got into shape within 

 that short time was very dramatic,? offers Deb. ?She was 

 running miles in the morning and working out for hours during 

 the day,? recalls Archana.

 The highlight of the contest was, 

 of course, the ramp-walk at the Lakme India Fashion Week 

 that found the girls matching steps with the best models. 

 ?It usually takes an aspirant two to six years to get up 

 there. And they were just freshers,? says Deb. More screening 

 rounds followed till Priyanka was finally crowned the winner. 

 ?It felt great but I didn?t have much time to think about 

 it as I had to rush back for my exams,? she admits.

 Up ahead is a one-year contract 

 with Channel [V] and Elite Model Management as well as campaigns 

 for LG. Despite having a year of her engineering course 

 left, the Gujarati girl says her parents wouldn?t mind if 

 she took up modelling as a career. 

 ?They know I will always maintain 

 my values. Besides, I?ve been managing sports and studies 

 for so long. It?ll be modelling and studies now.?

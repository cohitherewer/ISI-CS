 Untold stories on canvas

 Brought up in an urban environment, Kushal Mukherjee had diffused his perception of reality with his dreams and fancies to conjure in his mind an imaginary world of romance. His romantic vision was, however, distorted by a troubled social atmosphere, which cast a dark, brooding shadow on his view of life. Journey, the ongoing exhibition of his paintings, comprises works from the various stages of his life; when he looked upon the world with innocent awe and admiration, and also after he became aware of the injustices and sufferings of life. What is remarkable about his paintings is his bold, uninhibited use of colours. In fact, his choice of colours suggests that each of them reflects a mood or moment from life, each one distinct from the other, and indicated by a particular shade. Above all, Mukherjee?s paintings are an expression of his inner self. They represent the artist?s attempts to narrate the untold stories of his life to those who care to share his dreams, passions and longings.

 When: Till April 10, 3 pm - 8 pm

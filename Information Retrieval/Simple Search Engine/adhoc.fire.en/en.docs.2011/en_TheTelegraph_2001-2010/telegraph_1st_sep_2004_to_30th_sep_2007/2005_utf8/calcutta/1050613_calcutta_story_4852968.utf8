The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Many youths working in call centres in Calcutta are migrating 

 to other cities in the lure of better pay. However, they 

 often find it difficult to overcome the problems of language 

 and food there. I worked first in Hyderabad and then in 

 Chennai. In both cities, I found that the governments take 

 the initiative in the IT and ITES sectors to retain the 

 youth residing in those states. Companies can definitely 

 bring a revolutionary change in the call centre industry 

 in Calcutta with better pay packages.

 Supratim Bose, 

 Address not given. 

 On the morning of June 6, I went to Calcutta airport?s 

 domestic terminal to receive a colleague. The ATM of ICICI 

 just outside the entry gate refused to accept my card. Many 

 others faced the same problem. Finally, a representative 

 of the bank informed us that the machine was functioning 

 but there was no cash in it. But isn?t it the responsibility 

 of the bank to make sure that its ATMs don?t run out of 

 currency. And even if they do, a board should be put up 

 in front of the ATM informing customers of the lapse. 

 T.R. Anand,

 Calcutta University (CU) should use modern gadgets to hasten 

 processing of certificates. Even now CU gives certificates 

 four years after course completion.

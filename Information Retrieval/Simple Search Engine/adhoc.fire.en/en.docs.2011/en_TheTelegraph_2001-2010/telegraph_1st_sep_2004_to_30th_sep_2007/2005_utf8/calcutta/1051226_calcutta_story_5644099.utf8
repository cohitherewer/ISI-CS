 A novel facilitator agency promises to do medicine midwifery for anyone needing succour in the city. 

 The Kolkata Medical Information Centre, launched a week ago, provides information and arranges for medical assistance to NRIs, outstation travellers and even local people who would need networking.

 ?The cost of medical treatment in Calcutta is still quite reasonable, compared with the other metros, and we are keen to leverage this and promote medical tourism through a comprehensive bouquet of facilities, both in the field of medicine and in travel,? says Joyee Lahiri, the brain behind the project.

 Lahiri, who teaches communicative English at Presidency College and also runs a finishing school in the city, feels networking is often the grey area, not just for outstation patients, but also for aged people living alone in the city.

 Advanced treatment ? like open-heart surgery, hip and knee replacements, spinal surgeries, kidney transplants and laparoscopic surgeries ? and assisted conception therapies, including travel and subsistence for accompanying relatives, would be substantially cheaper in Calcutta than in other Indian cities, according to officials at the information centre.

 ?We will provide the patients, depending on their budget, with a list of top doctors in different disciplines, hospitals offering specialised individual therapies and inputs on the actual cost involved. We will be the liaison between the customer and the institution to provide hassle-free service during his or her stay,? says Lahiri.

 This will include providing transport from the railway station/airport, arranging accommodation, appointments for consultation, investigations, and booking dates for surgery. The information centre can be reached through three 24-hour helplines:

9231649173; 

9830891077; 

9331808595.

 The centre will facilitate medical assistance in the entire spectrum of specialities ? from gastroenterology to cardiothoracic surgery, obstetrics and gynaecology to orthopaedics, nephrology to endocrinology. 

 ?We will also have a ready resource pool of four to five doctors on emergency call, so that valuable time is not lost once someone in distress contacts us,? says Lahiri.

 There will be an annual registration cost for the services rendered. Annual membership for a family of up to four persons is Rs 2,000, with renewal fee pegged at Rs 1,500. 

 ?We will soon launch our website, so that people can access us on the Net. Roadshows in the UK and the US are also a possibility to acquaint NRI visitors with our bouquet of services,? Lahiri declares.

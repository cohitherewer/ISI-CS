 Protector or perpetrator?

 Eve teasing has assumed dangerous proportions in contemporary society, with incidents of harassment being reported almost everyday. Biswa-O-Shilpis production, Baan Haater Buro Angool, is a commendable initiative that highlights this social malaise, tries to find out its perpetrators and strike the disease at its roots. Based on a story by Siddhartha Singha, the play brings to light certain undesirable elements, who, in the guise of protectors of civil life and society, actually spread social evils and prevent the remedy of its ills. It unfolds the trials and torturous experiences of Sukanta, whose wife, a simple, unassuming and decent woman, has been the victim of eve teasing by some youths of their neighbourhood. When Sukanta seeks redressal of the act, he turns to his friends for support, who strangely refuse any help. The so-called guardians of society, like the local councillor and the police, only give him false assurances and make him run from pillar to post, but to no avail. Sukanta finally realises that he is all alone in his fight for justice, and that he has stirred up a problem that none cares to resolve. Stage adaptation and direction: Satyajit Kotal.

 You share your birthday with...

 Arun Lal 

Your down-to-earth and simple ways win hearts easily. You are never scared of hard work or long hours. You are too kind to doubt the intentions of others. You excel in teamwork. You are progressive by nature, always trying to evolve. You make a loyal, devoted and caring partner. ? Kusum Bhandari

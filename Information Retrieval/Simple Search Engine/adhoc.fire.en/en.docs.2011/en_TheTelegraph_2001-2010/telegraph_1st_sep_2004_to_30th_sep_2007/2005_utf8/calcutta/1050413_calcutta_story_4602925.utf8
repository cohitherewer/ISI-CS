 Importance of educating Sunny

 Four years ago, Sunny Das was promised an education. The five-year-old had been spotted studying by streetlight in front of the Esplanade Metro station, metres from the pavement his family calls home. He caught the eye of the Rajiv Gandhi Memorial Society, which admitted the boy to an English-medium school and offered him a scholarship.

 If there is one thing that Sunny has learnt by age nine, it is that promises made by adults are often empty. After one promotion, the school kicked him out, claiming the Society had not paid his fees. Over a year later, social workers from Don Bosco Ashalayam found him, and took him in.

 Madan Mitra, head of the Society, denies this. ?We tried very hard, but we could not socialise the family. We couldn?t change his environment, so we had to withdraw our support,? claims the Trinamul Youth Congress state chief. 

 The Das family that Metro visited on Monday may be poor, but they hardly require socialisation. Their home is a tiny area of pavement covered by a plastic sheet, a few battered belongings neatly arranged. Father Dilip ? who completed primary school and had tried to teach his son what little he knew ? does odd jobs, mainly helping taxi drivers at the stand by their kerb. Mother Lakshmi works in three homes and doubles as a ragpicker. Sunny has only one younger brother Bishu. Five other brothers and sisters ? including Buddhi last year ? have died.

 Mitra says he offered Dilip work and a place to live, both of which were refused. But the shelter, according to Dilip, was just a corner to put up his sheet at the party office. The job was night duty at SSKM Hospital. ?I had young children then. I couldn?t leave my wife alone with them.?

 The politician also accuses Sunny of begging. ?It takes a lot of work and effort to study, specially in an English-medium school,? he stresses. No one else, however, has ever seen Sunny beg, not even his neighbours, with whom the brothers are hugely popular.

 Mitra, it seems, never delivered at all. In July 2001, he took Sunny to Lenin Sarani?s Annex Convent School ? accompanied by TV news cameras ? and had him enrolled in Prep II. He bought his books and uniforms. That, allegedly, was that. 

 ?Sunny later told us that his teachers would make him sit on the stairs outside class because the fees hadn?t come in,? recalls Lakshmi. Ashamed, the earnest young boy didn?t say anything. Dilip said he could even scrape together enough to pay the Rs 300 monthly fee. ?But they were asking for a donation of around Rs 2,400, which I couldn?t give.? So having been promoted to Class I, Sunny had to drop out.

 The quiet boy, clearly focussed on his books, has been staying at the Asha Bosco home near Entally since last August and is back in Class I, this time at Carey School, in Sealdah. He likes it here. ?I have a lot of friends. They are all my brothers,? he explains. He has some ?sisters? too. On his right pinkie, he wears a ring with pink plastic stone which his new friend Pinky gave him. His favourite subject is English. ?I want to learn it so I can speak to everyone,? he says sagely, hoping one day, for an office job.

 Sunny?s parents are happy to see him safe and sound. ?If he stays in the home, he will grow up a good man,? muses Dilip. Once little Bishu ? who pulls out his brother?s hand-me-down backpack at the slightest provocation ? is old enough, they hope he too will be taken in. ?Why would I want my children to beg? So I could ruin their lives forever?? demands Dilip.

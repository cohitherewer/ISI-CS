 From sari to kurta, Kanishkas has always offered its clientele traditional splendour. The boutiques creative commitment upon completion of 35 years found expression in musical euphoria at the GD Birla Sabhagar on August 18.

 Celebrations started with the curtain-raiser being anchored by Mira Kakkar, and Rabindrasangeet artistes Manoj and Manisha Murli Nair enthralling audiences with the timeless Purano shei diner katha, Tumi rabe nirabe, Mamo chitte and Jodi tor daak shune keu na ashe.

 Among the audience were customers who have been associated with us right from the start, smiled Nandita Raja of Kanishkas.

 The star attraction of the evening was Bikram Ghosh who presented folk fusion, compositions from his forthcoming album Folktail. Bikram on tabla and Gopal Burman on srikhol were accompanied by folk singers Sahajmaa and Utpal Fakir who rendered melodies with tribal and Sufi origins.

 Festive flair

 Designer Shanta Daga retails from her plush studio Mahima, tucked away in Merlin Park, and also showcases her creations at exhibitions in aid of charity in Delhi and Mumbai. She recently launched a line of saris, salwar suits and western wear at her boutique for the coming festive season. Elegance is the keyword in her range of saris, with organza being the fabric of choice.

 Though I have saris in crepes, silks, chiffons and georgettes, the organza ones are just flying off the racks, smiles Daga. The saris are embellished with hand-embroidery, machine embroidery, zardosi, gold prints, floral prints, sequins and more. The casual saris, priced Rs 1,800 onwards, are mostly printed with embroidery on the borders and pallus, while the heavier ones with elaborate threadwork and zardosi come within Rs 20,000.

 The salwar kameezes also combine prints with embroidery. Short kurtas paired with patialas, long kameezes teamed with cigarette churidars, cotton and georgette printed kurtas combined with organza dupattas are some of the styles.

 The western wear racks boast mainly casuals ? capris, tunics, shirts, skirts and lots of printed scarves. The suits are priced between Rs 1,600 and Rs 6,000, the western wear starts at Rs 1,200. 

 Bath basics

 The term bathroom will soon be replaced with glamourooms, if one is to go by what K.Ranganathan, CEO, Parryware believes. Bathrooms have progressed from being mere utilities to premium lifestyle products, says he.

 The bathroom is a place of indulgence. Health, hygiene, water resources are of course still the primary concern, but todays consumer with a larger disposable income, wants quite a bit more. Hence, the concept of glamourooms, explains George Angelo, general manager, marketing and sales. 

 Parryware, which recently launched its Glamour range of premium sanitaryware in Calcutta, unveiled its new and aggressive marketing plan for eastern India. 

 The real estate boom in Bengal has provided a perfect opportunity for Parryware to showcase the Glamour range of sanitaryware. We are targeting 50 to 55 per cent growth in the east. 

 Four Experiencentres have already been opened by Parryware, where customers can take a closer look at the products and interact with architects, designers, builders and retailers. The fifth centre will become operational in Calcutta later this month.

 Consumers want to see and experience the products. The days of going to a dingy sanitaryware shop are becoming pass?, says Ranganathan.

 The Glamour range of sanitaryware is aimed at the high-end consumers. With entry-level prices of Rs 9,000, the exotic range of sanitaryware can set you back by no less than Rs 24,000. But a customer can avail of easy finance deals through Cholamandalam or HDFC Bank.

 The Glamour range also offers gadgets such as electronic taps, exotic shower panels and cisterns that dispense only 400 ml of water for those living in water-scarce areas.

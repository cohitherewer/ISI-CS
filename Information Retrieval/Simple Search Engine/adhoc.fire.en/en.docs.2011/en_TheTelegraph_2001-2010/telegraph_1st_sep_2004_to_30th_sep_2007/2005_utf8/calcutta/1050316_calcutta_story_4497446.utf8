The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Shift pleas on deaf ears

 A STAFF REPORTER

Even hours before Anuradha Mangatri, 28, ended her life on Saturday morning, she could not accept that her relationship with Suraj Sinha, 25-year-old son of Bihar Assembly?s chief marshal Bhanu Pratap Sinha, was over.

 ?After joining a private bank in Bangalore, Anuradha tried several times to convince Suraj to shift and settle down with her,? said additional superintendent of police (industrial) H.K. Kusumakar.

 He added: ?Suraj turned down his girlfriend?s proposal, saying he would not get a job in Bangalore that paid enough.?

 Anuradha, who came to Calcutta from Kalimpong five years ago, committed suicide on Saturday by hanging herself in her South Road apartment, in the Jadavpur area.

 Her live-in boyfriend Suraj, an employee in a software firm, discovered her body after returning from night duty.

 Police found a suicide note in which Anuradha mentioned the name of a second girl in Suraj?s life.

 ?We never thought they were not married. They rented the flat pretending to be a newly-married couple,? disclosed S. Raman, owner of the five-storey building in which the couple had rented an apartment. Raman lives on the floor below.

 When asked whether he had seen the girl mentioned in the suicide note, the landlord said: ?Suraj and Anuradha generally used the elevator. He used to come to me only once a month to pay the rent.?

 Jadavpur police are yet to trace the girl.

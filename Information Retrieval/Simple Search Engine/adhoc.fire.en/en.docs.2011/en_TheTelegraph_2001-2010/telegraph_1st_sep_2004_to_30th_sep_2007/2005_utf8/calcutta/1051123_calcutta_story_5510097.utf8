 The City Diary

 The state government is looking for land to rehabilitate the squatters of Gobindapur. In a meeting held at Writers? Buildings on Tuesday afternoon, municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya discussed the matter with mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya and minister of state for refugee rehabilitation and relief Nayan Sarkar.

 The problem is that the squatters don?t want to settle in the districts. We have land available in Ashoknagar, near Habra, in North 24-Parganas; Ghoshpara, in Kalyani; and 500 acres in Midnapore, near the Jharkhand border. But there are no takers for the plots,? said Sarkar.

 The government needs around 10 to 12 acres to rehabilitate the squatters. Sarkar is exploring the possibility of rehabilitating the settlers on a 400-acre plot in Sonarpur. ?We have to see whether acquisition money had been paid when our department acquired the Sonarpur plot in 1953-54. If we have, we can offer it to the squatters. The government is looking at the issue sympathetically,? added the minister of state.

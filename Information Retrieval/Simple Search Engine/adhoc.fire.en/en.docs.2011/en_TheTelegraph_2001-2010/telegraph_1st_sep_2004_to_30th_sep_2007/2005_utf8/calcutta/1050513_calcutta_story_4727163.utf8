The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Mall options multiply

 SUBHRO SAHA

 The basket of options when you stock up for the kitchen and provisions, is set to get wider soon, as the supermarket scenario in the city, already churned up by the likes of C3, Wot Not and Food Bazaar, heats up further with the RPG charge.

 Following the ?Giant? step at the upcoming Mani Square with the 50,000-sq ft Spencer?s Hypermarket as the anchor of the Bypass mall, RPG Enterprises is looking to achieve greater penetration in Calcutta through a string of smaller-format Spencer Supermarkets.

 ?We are looking at eight to 10 such supermarkets, each in a 7,000-10,000-sq ft floor-space band, to sit in strategic locations and we hope the first store will be up and running by the year-end,? Raghu Pillai, president amp; CEO, RPG Retail, told Metro.

 The group aims to cater to the ?typical? as opposed to the cosmopolitan Calcuttan as its focused audience. ?The quintessential ethnic Bengali has to come into our stores, be it the hypermarts or the supermarkets, and from merchandising to pricing to signage, everything will be geared towards achieving that,? stressed Pillai.

 The retail head of the group said Spencer?s Hypermarket, which is the erstwhile Giant brand re-christened and being used by the Great Wholesale Club Ltd, will bring in international delivery standards at Indian pricing. ?We believe in doing things right rather than doing the right things and at Spencer?s, you could be anywhere in the world.?

 While pricing will be ?extremely aggressive?, RPG Enterprises will also focus on retailer-driven promos to drive volumes. 

 The second Spencer?s Hypermarket is set to come up inside the South City Mall, and will be the chain?s biggest outlet in the country, sprawled across 80,000 sq ft.

 ?In our revised strategy, we are looking at 250,000 to 300,000 sq ft of hypermart space in Calcutta, to be covered by three or four outlets, with catchments of 30-minute driving distances, Rajarhat being a preferred location,? Pillai added.

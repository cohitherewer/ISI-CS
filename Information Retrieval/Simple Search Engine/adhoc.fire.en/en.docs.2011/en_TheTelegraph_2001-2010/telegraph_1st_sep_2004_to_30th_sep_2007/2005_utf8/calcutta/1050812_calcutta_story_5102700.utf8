 Cancer drugs sans tests

 - Oncologists advise radiation without malignancy proof

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 A section of oncologists stands accused of advising chemotherapy to suspected cancer patients without a conclusive proof of malignancy.

 Chemotherapy drugs are known for their highly toxic nature and adverse effects on the body, including on bone marrow and the mucous membrane. They are supposed to be prescribed only after a diagnostic test yields a positive result.

 ?If administered to a person not suffering from cancer, chemotherapy drugs in the long run can increase the chances of cancer, as they destroy normal cells. This is one reason why benign tumours are not treated with radiation,? said oncologist Subir Ganguly, former president of Indian Medical Association and head of the radiotherapy department of Burdwan Medical College and Hospital.

 Recently, a 55-year-old engineer, Deepankar Basu, was administered chemotherapy in the city even after two fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) procedures proved he was not suffering from cancer. The engineer?s condition worsened immediately after the treatment and detailed investigation revealed that he was suffering from tuberculosis.

 Saroj Gupta, director and secretary of Cancer Centre and Welfare Home in Thakurpukur, admitted that some doctors were depending solely on their ?clinical eye? in prescribing cancer drugs. ?Every treatment of cancer must be backed by histo-pathological evidence, not just clinical diagnosis,? he told Metro.

 Which was not the case with Basu. The engineer?s travails started in February, when he suffered a recurrent cough, along with fever. A CT scan revealed multiple nodes in the thorax.

 Oncologist Arunavo Sengupta advised two FNACs, but neither showed signs of lung cancer. ?We were still advised to go for chemotherapy, which we did. But his condition deteriorated, prompting us to seek a second opinion. Finally, we realised that he was suffering from tuberculosis,? said Shankar Dutta, Basu?s brother-in-law.

 When contacted, oncologist Sengupta said: ?It?s good that Basu is not suffering from cancer. His relatives need not worry about the chemotherapy, as it has no bad effect.?

 Similarly, a 70-year-old man was found to be suffering from anaemia after being treated for leukaemia by oncologist Asish Mukherjee. The doctor, however, argued: ?Cancer must have been diagnosed, otherwise we wouldn?t have treated him for the disease at all.?

 Doctors say such cases are also reported from Burdwan, Bankura, Siliguri and other parts of Bengal.

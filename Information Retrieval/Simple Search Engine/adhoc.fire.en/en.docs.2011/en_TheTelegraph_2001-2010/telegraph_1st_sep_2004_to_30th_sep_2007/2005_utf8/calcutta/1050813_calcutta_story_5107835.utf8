The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Strike, haze cripple fliers

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 A strike in Heathrow and a haze in Kuala Lumpur. The ripple effect threw schedules of hundreds of passengers, to or from Calcutta, haywire. While many city-bound travellers are stranded in London, others in Calcutta are planning to cancel their travel plans to the destinations altogether.

 Sangeeta Sett was expected to arrive in the city on Friday morning by a British Airways flight to attend her father?s funeral. ?Stranded in London, she was desperate to get on another flight. She is now taking an Air-India flight to Calcutta via Delhi, but will reach here only tomorrow. Unfortunately, the funeral could not be put on hold,? said Sanjoy Sett, Sangeeta?s brother in-law.

 With the support staff at Heathrow airport on strike, about 300-plus passengers scheduled to take the British Airways flight to London early on Friday were left scouting for alternatives.

 ?I have to reach Las Vegas on August 14 for a trade fair. I was planning to take the London-Los Angeles-Las Vegas route, but with the flight cancelled, I am looking at a diversion via Singapore, which will cost me another Rs 25,000,? rued R.B. Lahoti, a jute goods exporter, who had a ticket on BA-146 to London on Friday.

 A British Airways spokesperson said from Delhi: ?We have adopted a wait-and-watch strategy. A clear picture will emerge only after 10.30 pm on Friday. However, we are trying to help the passengers.?

 While passengers like Sett got stuck in London, others like S.K. Mahajan and his wife, Sharda, had to abandon plans of a dream holiday in Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur. The two cities have been severely affected by the haze sweeping across Malaysia.

 ?I got in touch with the Malaysian embassy, who put me through to Malaysian Tourism officials. They advised me that it wasn?t wise to travel to Kuala Lumpur right now,? said Mahajan, who is scouting for alternative locales.

 About 100 people from the city fly to Malaysia daily. In view of the ticket cancellations, city travel agents say they are set to lose Rs 5 lakh a day, if the situation does not improve soon.

 ?The flights are on schedule so we can?t tell passengers not to go. Instead, we are requesting the tourism authorities to accommodate the passengers at a later date,? said Anil Punjabi, chairman (east) of Travel Agents Federation of India.

 Marvels of science

 Many of them detested their science lessons at school, some dreamed of bagging a Nobel in physics, and the rest were plain curious. 

 But when liquid flowed from one vessel to another all on its own and coins flipped in the air just refused to come back down, their excitement knew no bounds. 

 ?It?s no magic, just science,? they were told by the officials at the Children?s Science Festival, held from November 14 to 19 at Birla Industrial and Technological Museum. 

 Almost 9,500 children from various schools and NGOs across the city enjoyed the guided gallery tours, coal-mine visits, sci-trick shows and quiz at the festival which was opened on Children?s Day. 

 The shows were conceived and organised according to the age group of children slotted on each day of the festival. The on-the-spot fun contests related to science met with an overwhelming response. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya

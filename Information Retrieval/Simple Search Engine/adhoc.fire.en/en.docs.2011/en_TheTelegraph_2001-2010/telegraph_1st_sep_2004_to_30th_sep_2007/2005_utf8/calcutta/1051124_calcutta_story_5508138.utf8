 India held pole position as the worlds sole supplier of diamonds for 2,000 long years. Today, it has the worlds largest undeclared gold reserve in any single country. Out of the worlds top 11 diamonds companies, eight are Indian? 

 Many more such lesser-known facts and figures, interesting trend studies, a breathtaking display of jewels, a select but keen audience and great wine with light bites made for a truly memorable morning.

 Hosted by jewellery designer Raj Mahtani at his Park Street store Satramdas Dhalamal on Tuesday, the event was held for Time and Talents Club Calcutta, an organisation supporting charities and institutions to promote relief, medical aid and education for the underprivileged.

 The morning that began with an audio-visual display of Rajs Singapore showroom, progressed to an informative presentation.

 It took the audience back to the history of both his ancestral ornament firm and of jewellery in general.

 There are five distinct periods of history that have influenced jewellery trends, said Raj, before an interesting slide-show took the crowd through the various influences.

 Prominent ones were that of Mohenjodaro and Harappa in the Ancient period, the medieval European fashion in the Middle Ages and Renaissance, the Baroque touches from the 17th and 18th centuries, the opulent drama of the 19th century and the powerful statements made in the 20th century.

 India is definitely going to be the worlds next jewellery powerhouse, be it in manufacturing, wearing or exporting, added Raj, before he touched upon machine-made pieces and the necessity to revive ancient trends in handmade jewellery.

 A special guest at the event was Rani Jaisingh of Jaipur, wife of Maharaja Jaisingh and daughter-in-law of Maharani Gayatri Devi of Jaipur. Looking regal in a green chiffon sari, she effortlessly mingled with the crowd. 

 While the audience was soaking in the stylish ambience of the store, city models Priyanka Pal, Tanushree and Devdutta showcased the stunning line of couture jewels designed by Raj.

 The first collection was the diamond range, where large sparklers dazzled the guests. Very European in design, these pieces had a strong Mughal flavour as well.

 The next sequence, a fusion line of gold with polkis, had a modern twist, while still being very Mughal. The idea is to use these designs with every possible style, be it modern meshes or very traditional, explained Raj.

 Finally, the show-stopper ? the exquisite couture line. These heavy pieces were dripping old-world, Nizam charm. 

 Other than his trademark diamonds, Raj also showcased a variety of rubies, rubilites, sapphires and large table-cut emeralds.

 After Rajs session, queries poured in from the guests. Posers about platinum, polki, table-cut diamonds, the sudden stardom of tanzanite, social stigma of blue stones and more came in from many eager quarters of of trinket watchers and wearers.

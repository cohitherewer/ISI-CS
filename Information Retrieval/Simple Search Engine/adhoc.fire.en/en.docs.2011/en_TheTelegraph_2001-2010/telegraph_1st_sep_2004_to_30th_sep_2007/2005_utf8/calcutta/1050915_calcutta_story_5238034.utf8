 An out-of-shape and lazy city limbering up to burn that fat and put its fittest form forward ? never more so than in the festive season. That?s Calcutta in the eyes of fitness ? and slimming ? chains keeping pace with the Calcuttan on the run.

 The proof of the fitness fad lies in the figures. The scramble to slim down has seen the city (with only three franchisees) figuring next only to Bangalore (with seven centres) on the VLCC wall of fame. As if to return the gesture, VLCC on Wednesday announced six brand new outlets ? scrapping the three earlier ones ? dotting New Alipore, Theatre Road, Jodhpur Park, Kankurgachhi, VIP Road and Howrah.

 Having set up shop in the city six years ago, Vandana Luthra, chairperson, VLCC, patted the city on the back for going the extra mile ? and paying the extra buck ? to get into shape: ?Calcutta is the fastest growing market in health and fitness now. Till even three years ago, people were unaware of the latest technology and concepts. Today, Calcutta is second only to Bangalore in terms of our revenue generation and enrolments, and in two months it should be number one.?

 With Puja 2005 just over three weeks away, the frenzy to get fit is on the rise. Those who have been irregular through the year are now coming in five days a week, says Sabyasachi Chakraborty of Addlife Gymnasium and Spa. ?Attendance is close to 100 per cent, with men determined to tone their muscles and women desperate to shed that extra inch at the waist. This is the time of the year that we get our head trainer down from Mumbai,? adds the manager of the 22, Camac Street workout address with 500 members.

 The way Calcuttans sweat it out has also changed. ?Previously, the footfall rose with every Salman Khan release. But now people go for high-endurance levels, athleticism and de-stressing,? says Pankaj Arora, country head, Geo-Fitness Studio, in Forum.

 As value-adds, the gyms are providing orientation sessions, assessment programmes, dieticians and nutritionists ? all health helps at hand for the Calcuttan on the go.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Faith kept, patience lost

Nisha Lahiri tries to understand 

why George Michael has turned his back on his music and his mission

Michael: A Different Story in Berlin. Pictures by Reuters 

The caress of a careless whisper, the sadness of a 

love lost, the joy of freedom and faith? George Michael has wowed us with words 

and melted us with melodies. In the process, he has transformed himself from a 

callow youngster with wild hair and over-enthusiastic finger-snapping to a rock 

rebel with leather jacket and torn jeans to a mature man with an unbeatable sense 

of style.

And now, he?s quit.

Through it all, Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou remained 

a restrained rebel without a cause. Restrained, because he never really lived 

an out-and-out lifestyle of the rich and famous, although he admits to smoking 

?too much pot?. 

But the Londoner of Greek descent has invariably titillated 

fans and foes alike. Be it through lewd behaviour in a public place or through 

a song that depicts two of the most powerful men in the world as cartoon caricatures 

of dog and master.

And now, he?s gone silent on his fans.

Controversy has been part of the soft-spoken, ?secretive? 

man from Finchley?s life since he shot to stardom with Wham! in the 1980s. Shying 

away from publicity, he kept the fact that he was gay quiet for a long time, finally 

outing himself by being arrested in 1998 in a toilet in a park near Beverly Hills. 

Since, other homosexual singers like Boy George and Elton John have slammed him 

for staying in the closet for as long as he did. 

And now, he?s shunned it all for the quiet life.

The 41-year-old often drew inspiration for his music 

from his own life. In his biography Bare, he admits that Careless Whispers 

was based on his own experience of two-timing. The meteoric rise to fame, 

from working on a building site to an usher in a cinema hall to DJ in a restaurant 

and then a health club (?my DJ career had been all downhill?) to superstardom 

as the frontman of Wham! and then a hugely successful solo career. 

But the 80-million-dollar man has given it all up 

to write songs for others. 

It hasn?t been an easy or smooth road. There was the 

battle with Sony, which he lost, and he had to fulfil the terms of his contract. 

He lost a boyfriend to AIDS in 1993, and then his mother in 1997. Michael admitted 

in interviews that when he got depressed and really down, he turned to commentaries 

on the state of the world for inspiration. Shoot the Dog followed, featuring 

George Bush and Tony Blair.

The furore didn?t deter him then, although the media 

frenzy did put him off. 

And now, he?s giving all that a miss.

Once a rebel, always a rebel. After his last album, 

Patience, Michael announced that he wouldn?t release any more albums. He 

said his songs would be available free to download off the Internet. Fans could 

donate to his favourite charities instead. That, he said in an interview, would 

make him happier. 

But he?s gone a step further and on February 16, at 

the Berlin Film Festival, after the screening of a documentary on his life, George 

Michael: A Different Story, he announced he was leaving the music industry.

He said the genre of music that made him famous was 

dead. ?Nobody wants to hear about politics, or any kind of strong ideas in pop 

any more,? the man of Faith declared, somewhat belligerently.

The candid documentary touched on most aspects of 

his life, even featuring Elton John describing his contemporary as ?frustrating?. 

The previous public spat between the two had John talking about Michael as ?wasting? 

his talents.

Now, the handsome clean-cut singer wants to write 

songs for other people, maybe a musical for the screen, not stage. His poignant 

parting words are perhaps a better indication of the man than the life he has 

lived ? ?I just thought it was very important to explain myself before I disappear? 

I truly believe that there?s a life for me that is not this one.?

Brew beats

Much more than just coffee is brewing at the Barista 

cafe chain all over the country. Along with its fine coffees and savouries, the 

chain is now selling music, as well.

The cafe major has bagged exclusive rights to sell music CDs of Manu Rawals 

recent release Chai Pani Etc. The CDs of the film are available at Barista outlets 

across the country, for Rs 50.

Rewals film stars Konkona Sen Sharma in a double 

role alongside Zafar Karachiwala (seen in picture above) and Channel [V] VJ Gaurav 

Kapoor.

The Chai Pani Etc soundtrack features four songs composed 

by debutante music director Sawan Datta. The 34-year-old former architect, who 

composes jingles and signature tunes for TV channels and shows, has lent her voice 

to two of the tracks.

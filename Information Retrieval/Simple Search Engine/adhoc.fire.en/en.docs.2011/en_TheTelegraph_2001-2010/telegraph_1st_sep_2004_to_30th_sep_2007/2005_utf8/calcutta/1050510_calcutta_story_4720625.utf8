 lsquo;After Black, I wanted to do something colourful rsquo;

 Having framed the picture-perfect images of Sanjay Leela Bhansali rsquo;s Black, cinematographer RAVI CHANDRAN is back with Shah Rukh rsquo;s latest home production, Amol Palekar rsquo;s Paheli. He speaks to Pratim D. Gupta about the riot of colours, understanding Rani rsquo;s face and the greatness of King Khan

 How did Paheli happen?

 After Black I wanted to do something colourful, something quicker. I had missed out on working with Shah Rukh Khan on three blockbusters ? Devdas, Main Hoon Na and Kal Ho Naa Ho ? due to date problems. So, as soon as I knew Paheli would be a Shah Rukh Khan film and would be shot in just 45 days, I said yes without even knowing the director. Later I came to know that Amol Palekar would direct the film.

 The visuals look different from an Amol Palekar movie?

 I have done whatever was needed to help the story. Amol Palekar is from a different school of film-making. His visual sense is totally different from that of Mani Ratnam and Sanjay Leela Bhansali. This is also the most expensive film Palekar has ever made. He is known for his small films but Paheli is so very grand. I had to adjust to Palekar?s visual style but it wasn?t that difficult.

 And how was Shah Rukh Khan?

 Fantastic. He is the most intelligent actor I have ever worked with. You can talk to him about shots, Playstation games, song sequences, what not. He knows everything about editing, shooting, lighting, etc. He would go to the focus-puller and assign the focussing mark. My focus-puller has been working for the last 30 years and has worked with everyone from MGR to NT Rama Rao to Kamal Haasan to Rajnikanth. He told me, ?I have never seen an actor who?s so knowledgeable about cinema.? Shah Rukh has no egos in discussing things with the cast and crew. And he is extremely hard working. Despite not being a morning person, he would come at 4 and 5 in the morning. 

 Rani has never looked better?

 Yes, everyone?s been messaging me about her look. The idea is to love the artiste. Only then can you make her look better. This is the fourth time I am working with Rani after Calcutta Mail, Yuva and Black. I now understand her face ? which angles look good, which light looks good. In Yuva and Black, she was without make-up. Here, she had to look very glamourous.

 I also know Preity?s face very well having worked with her in Dil Chahta Hai and Koi? Mil Gaya. Tabu too ? she still messages me for making her look the best in Virasat and Kandukondain Kandukondain. Kajol was so relieved when she learnt that I will be shooting her in Kunal Kohli?s film. We have worked together in Sapnay.

You also shot Bachchan in Paheli after Black?

 Yes, he has a very small but interesting role in the film. He just shot for two days and he looks very cute in the Rajasthani make-up. Even Shah Rukh?s moustache is there to make him look like a Rajasthani.

 What was the strategy you adopted for the Paheli images?

 The film?s got a lot of colours. I didn?t do too much of source lighting. I adopted a very glamourous style for Paheli. I have used very little contrast. The actors had to look good. I have also used a lot of warm lights and no blue light at all. In fact, even to create the moonlight, I used warm light. Shah Rukh got a new camera for me to shoot the film. He even got new lenses. So, I was a happy man.

 How difficult was it shooting something so colourful after Black?

 It?s not that I haven?t shot something like this before. Saat Rang Ke Sapne and Virasat fell in this category of films. What I am trying to do consciously is to shoot different kinds of films. If you look at my last four works ? Yuva, Koi? Mil Gaya, Black and Paheli ? they are totally different from each other. 

 I don?t want someone to watch a film and say: ?This is Ravi Chandran?s camerawork?. There are cinematographers who try and do the same kind of work in every film. That formula is successful but safe. Camerawork should go along with the story.

 But shouldn?t you have your own trademark?

 I don?t want that. Being different in every project is work-wise a lot more challenging. I don?t want comfort levels in shooting. That?s why I like working with new directors. They expect to make me do something different. I also don?t want to repeat myself. So there?s a constant search. 

 In the process, I do lose out on awards and nominations. I could have shot Yuva like Dil Chahta Hai with three protagonists in both the films. But I gave Yuva a different visual language altogether. Then, one of the reasons I didn?t take up Kal Ho Naa Ho was because they wanted me to shoot the film like Dil Chahta Hai. But I didn?t want to do another Dil Chahta Hai. Priyan (director Priyadarshan) and I are such good friends and have great work chemistry but the reason I don?t work with him these days is because he is going on doing similar types of comedies.

 Now, I would be shooting Kunal?s new film with Aamir and Kajol, which will be completely different from Paheli. Every film has to challenge my sensibilities and let me experiment and figure out a new look all the time.

 Do you do a lot of research before every film?

 Yes, I watch a lot of new films from around the world and read a lot of foreign film magazines to understand the craft better. I constantly buy new lights and filters to try something different. For Black, I studied Kaagaz Ke Phool and Trikaal. I give complete credit to the two films for the images of Black.

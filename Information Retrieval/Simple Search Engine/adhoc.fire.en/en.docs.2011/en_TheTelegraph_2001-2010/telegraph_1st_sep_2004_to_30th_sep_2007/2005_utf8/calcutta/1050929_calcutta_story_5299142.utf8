The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Phoney tunes

 No more queues to strain your vocal chords. No more early mornings to ensure your auditions. No more blockades to bypass the brigade. Now you can do an Abhijeet Sawant or a Ravindra Upadhyay on your cell phone. The registrations for Mobile Singer, Channel [V]?s latest on the reality roster, are open only through telephony.

 But aren?t the registration rules for Indian Idol the same in its second season on Sony? ?It feels good to be plagiarised,? smiled Amar K. Deb, head honcho of Channel [V], who came down to Calcutta on Wednesday to launch the latest from India?s numero uno musical channel. ?We had tried this concept of singing on mobile phones a year back for a special practice session on [V] Super Singer. Having done those tests, now we are ready to do this entire show, where all the singing happens on the phone making the process really simple.?

 With ?geographical boundaries erased? and ?the bias of look completely knocked out?, making one?s voice heard couldn?t have become easier. And guess who?s hearing ?em all? The Dada of Disco, Bappi Lahiri.

 So this is how it works: From October 7, you can call on specially designated numbers from your mobiles and land lines. After scanning through the menu of Bappida?s chosen numbers (his own songs, of course), you have to pick the song you would like to sing. When ready, just sing with the background music provided to you. Once recorded, you can listen to your own song and if you don?t like what you hear, you can record all over again.

 ?For a judge, it is physically possible to listen to at the most 400 singers in a single day,? revealed Deb. ?So in a two-day audition, a lot of people can?t make it. Here, maximum number of people can enter the contest and there is not even the intimidating mike. After an initial scanning by experts in every city, we will shortlist the best voices. Bappida will then pick the 10 to 15 he likes and train them in his Mumbai studio. Only one will go on to record a song with him and feature in a video.?

 As for the electronic entertainer himself, Bappi is very excited with the concept. ?I am expecting a whole lot of talented singers to emerge from this competition. In my music career spanning 32 years and 440 films, I have given breaks to many a top singer like Usha Uthup, Runa Laila, Alisha Chinai, Salma Agha, Sharon Prabhakar and Sudesh Bhonsle. I hope I can also use this platform to give some new voices to the industry.?

 We also hope all that glitters is gold.

 Diktat on dengue check

 - Ministers want swift work to clean up mosquito cradles

 OUR BUREAU

 Stung by the loss of seven lives to dengue in and outside Calcutta, the government on Monday issued a diktat.

 It asked the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and 41 municipalities across Bengal to locate and destroy, on a war footing, the breeding grounds of the Ades mosquito, which spreads the disease.

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee left for Singapore on Monday, but acting chief minister Mohammad Amin and urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya directed the civic authorities to step up efforts to curb the disease.

 The focal areas ? Lake Gardens, Dhakuria, Tollygunge, Anwar Shah Road, Ranikuthi, Bijoygarh and Santoshpur, in south Calcutta, swathes of Dum Dum, including Bediapara and RN Tagore Road, and Bhatpara, deep north.

 Amin was briefed on the latest situation concerning dengue and malaria. Apart from the seven deaths, over 100 patients have shown dengue-like symptoms. One death, caused by meningitis, was reported from Bhatpara on Sunday evening.

 ?We are deeply concerned over the deaths of seven persons in the city proper and one at Bhatpara in the past three days, following the spread of dengue and malaria. Wards 92 and 94 in Calcutta are the worst hit. All 41 municipal bodies and the CMC have been put on alert,? minister Bhattacharya told reporters at Writers? Buildings.

 Earlier, he held a meeting with health secretary Kalyan Bagchi and municipal affairs secretary Dipankar Mukherjee to review the situation.

 CMC commissioner Debashis Som, key officers from the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority and the municipalities, too, were present.

 The minister was reportedly annoyed with the civic body for not engaging its officers to destroy the mosquito?s breeding grounds at construction sites.

 ?Larvae are spawning in stagnant water accumulated in reservoirs, constructed for housing projects. Besides, mosquitoes also breed in piled-up garbage and rooftops where water is allowed to collect. I want the civic body and other municipalities not to allow accumulation of water at any place,? the minister asserted. 

 Those feeling unwell should immediately report to the School of Tropical Medicine and National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases for blood tests. 

 The CMC complaint room phone numbers are 22861212/1313/1414.

 Fashion seems to be firmly in focus this week with some of the top names in the country?s couture clique descending on Calcutta?s style horizon. 

 It?s not often that one gets to see design biggies like Tarun Tahiliani, Wendell Rodricks, Malini Ramani, Aparna Chandra, Ritu Kumar, Sabyasachi Mukherjee, Anamika Khanna and Sarbari Dutta showcasing on the city ramp all in one week. But that?s precisely what you will get to feast your eyes on as the week draws to a close.

 The action on the fashion front kicks off on February 25 with the Seagram?s Blender?s Pride Fashion Tour 2005. This two-day show, held in association with the Oberoi Grand, will witness style gurus Tarun Tahiliani, Wendell Rodricks, Malini Ramani and Aparna Chandra showcasing their ensembles, some of them for the first time ever in the city. 

 Calcutta is the second stop for this nationwide fashion tour, which will see hot bods like Fleur Xavier, Tupur Chatterjee, Candice Pinto, Jesse Randhawa and Nina Manuel sashaying down the ramp at the hotel along with latest modelling heartthrob Upen Patel. 

 ose on the heels of this comes another mega designer affair at the Tollygunge Club on February 27. Organised by Spandan, HSBC Premier and Tollygunge Club, this one pays tribute to some of the style honchos from our city who have put Calcutta on the national and international fashion map.

 The ramp here will haute up with Ritu Kumar, Sarbari Dutta, Sabyasachi Mukherjee and Anamika Khanna displaying their fineries. The show called Haridra celebrates ?the spirit of yellow? as a befitting welcome for spring, but the theme is not followed strictly in the colour code of the clothes.

 ?The garments I will display at the show will not have any particular colour theme. It will be a mix and match from my work. I will also showcase something from my Frog Princess collection,? said Sabyasachi.

 Ritu Kumar is all set to unveil her bridal best in ?colours of Holi and Rajasthani palette?. The ace designer plans to open the show with her latest bridal wear line, later moving on to some pret. ?Most of my showing will comprise bridal lehngas and saris. But I will wrap up with a sequence from my Label line,? she said from Delhi. ?I love to showcase my work in Calcutta. I would have loved to be present at the show, but I have to be in LA for the Oscar ceremony on the same day as my son?s film has been nominated,? she added. 

 Models Candice Pinto and Sharan Mishra from Mumbai will share the ramp with some of our city models. The fashion show will be followed by a performance by singer Shayne Hyrapiet.

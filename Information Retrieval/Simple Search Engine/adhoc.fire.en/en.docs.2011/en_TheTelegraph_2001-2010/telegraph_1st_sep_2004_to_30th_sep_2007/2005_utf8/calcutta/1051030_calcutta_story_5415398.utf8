The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Next weekend you can be at ... 

Motijharna

 Serene and exotic, yet unknown, getaways are abundant in eastern India. But few can be more charming than Motijharna. With a nip now in the air, a romantic escapade to this tribal village is the perfect way to get over the post-Puja blues.

 An overnight train ride via Bolpur, the Barharwa hills and the quiet Tinpahar will get you to Maharajpur. The whisper of an adjacent stream ? a tributary of the Ganga that again merges with the river at Rajmahal ? will welcome you at the station. Trek a kilometre through the town and trudge a couple of kilometres up a small hillock to reach Motijharna.

 A waterfall cascading from a lovely glen in the surrounding hills is the main attraction. Streamlets show the way through the virgin forests around the hamlet.

 For the most panoramic view, you have to reach a pond dug out by the water falling from a height of 80 ft in the rock wall. It?s like an amphitheatre. Groves of wild banana dot the foot of the falls. There?s a cave, too, for you to explore. Standing inside, you just might forget the metropolis you?ve left behind.

 To see the falls in full glory, one has to come here in August- September.

 The other attraction of Motijharna is the tribal haat on Tuesdays and Saturdays. A ferry ride on the Ganga tributary is in order for the thrill-seekers.

 Stop over at Rajmahal if you can. For those game for adventure, a downstream boat ride from Maharajpur is the best way to get there. Others can take a train from Maharajpur to Tinpahar Junction, and then another train to Rajmahal along the metre-gauge line.

 Rajmahal has a rich history, dating back to the times of Akbar. As the name suggests, there are a number of dilapidated palatial buildings here. Singhi Dalan, overlooking the Ganga, and Juma Masjid, with its sculpted stone walls, are must visits. 

 Go deeper into the past at the ruins of the Teliagari Fort, near Sahibganj. The railway school here has an interesting collection of sculptures.

 Going 

 3133 UP Sealdah-Varanasi Express, leaving at 8.55 pm, and 3071 UP Howrah-Jamalpur Express, leaving at 9.40 pm, reach Sahibganj early in the morning. Take a local train to Maharajpur, which is 14 km by road from Sahibganj and 23 km from Rajmahal. Trekkers and buses are available

 Staying 

 The Damni Dak Bungalow, atop a hillock, is the only option in Maharajpur. Bookings can be made at the office of deputy commissioner of police in Sahibganj or the block office at Taljhari, two stations from Maharajpur. Rajmahal and Sahibganj offer more choice

 Texts take a summer holiday 

 - Vacation-time work now means learning while having fun

 RICHA BANSAL

 Five-year-old Shivangi will spend quite a bit of her summer vacations in the kitchen ? not helping mother Anju Goel with the cooking, but learning her math.

 For, holiday homework is wearing a happy look this summer. Malini Bhagat, headmistress, Mahadevi Birla Girls School, where Shivangi is a Class I student, explains just how: ?A child her age can be taught simple addition and subtraction through kitchen work.?

 For instance, she can be asked to count peas, apportion different amounts for different members of the family and then figure out how much is used and how much remains. Or she can be taught different shapes and sizes through vegetables and fruits, feels Bhagat.

 The idea, say principals, is to make home-work enjoyable for children so that they add to their knowledge bank without subtracting from the fun of the holidays.

 So, children from several schools will no longer have to toil through textbooks for hours this summer or keep away from their favourite comics and cartoons.

 In fact, Arpita Singh will be encouraging son Abhishek, a Class V student at Nopany Vidyalaya, to watch his cartoons and read his storybooks.

 ?Abhishek?s holiday homework is to make a picture scrapbook of these cartoon characters, collecting as much information on them as possible, in addition to reading books and making a dictionary of new words that he picks up,? she explains.

 ?Even for math, he will be solving puzzles and practising by making a set of his friends, then dividing them into subsets and so on. He is already very excited,? adds Abhishek?s mother.

 In many schools, children are being asked to write on the place they will visit during the holidays, review storybooks, write stories or make picture scrapbooks on a given theme.

 Not only is reading being encouraged, children are also free to adopt the style of their favourite author to develop writing skills.

 Angela Ghose, head, primary section, St James? School, is experimenting with the idea of giving children the freedom to pen poetry.

 ?There will be no hard-and-fast rule. Since all children do not go on holidays or may not have undertaken any activity they want to write about, even expressing their emotions is acceptable,? she explains.

 Archana Jain, whose son Shantam studies in Class V at St James?, says: ?My son is quite self-reliant and I am sure his thought process will develop much more holistically this way than by doing loads of regular home-work.?

 The system also ensures that parents can?t finish the holiday home-work for their children, which would often be the case if they were set questions from textbooks to complete, observe principals.

 Adding a technological twist to the tale, Mukta Nain, principal, Birla High School for Boys, will be posting the holiday home-work on the school?s website for the first time. 

 ?We have already informed parents and students that they will have to check it to find out what is to be done. This will also make then comfortable with the Net,? she feels.

 Among the innovative methods being adopted by schools to keep students busy and happy are mathematical fallacies in the form of puzzles. 

 ?If the puzzle turns out to be a fallacy, the child learns much more in trying to figure out the logic behind it,? explains Neville Noronha, principal, Nopany Vidyalaya.

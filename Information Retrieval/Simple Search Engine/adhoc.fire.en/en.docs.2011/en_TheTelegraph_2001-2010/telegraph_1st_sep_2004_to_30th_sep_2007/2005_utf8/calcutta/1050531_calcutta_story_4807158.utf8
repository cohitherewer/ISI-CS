 Couple on hill holiday drowns

 SANJAY MANDAL

 The bodies of a middle-aged couple from Salt Lake were recovered on Sunday from the Alakananda river in Rudraprayag.

 Vaskar Dasgupta, 50, and his wife Indrani, 45, residents of Karunamoyee housing estate, were on holiday since mid-May.

 They are believed to have drowned in the turbulent Uttaranchal waters, though police are still awaiting the post-mortem results for confirmation.

 The two were cremated on Monday by their only son Dipra, who had rushed to the site of the tragedy. He returned to the city on Monday.

 Vaskar, a senior employee with a multinational firm, had gone to Delhi on May 15. Indrani, a teacher of economics at St James? School, joined him on May 18. They reached Rudraprayag on May 21 and went missing since then.

 ?The bodies were discovered on Sunday morning,? said P.S. Sailal, superintendent of police, Rudraprayag, over telephone on Monday.

 A group of rafters spotted the bodies and alerted the cops. They were found in Shivpur, Tehri-Gadwal, almost 80 km from the hotel at Rudraprayag where they had checked in. 

 Their shoes were recovered from the bank of the river around 250 m from Hotel Murar where they were staying. The couple had also asked local residents about how to get to the riverbank, police learnt.

 The stony bank can be dangerous, said police. The water is also extremely turbulent, and it is likely that one of them slipped into the water, while the other also drowned in a rescue bid.

 Back in Salt Lake, their neighbours were shocked to hear the news. ?They were a lively, caring couple,? said Bela Sanyal. ?The day before she left, Indrani went to watch a play. That was the last time I spoke to her,? she said.

 ?Indrani was extremely popular with her colleagues and students. She got along well with everyone,? said Ismail Nehal, Indrani?s colleague at St James? School.

 Dipra was unavailable for comment when contacted at his residence.

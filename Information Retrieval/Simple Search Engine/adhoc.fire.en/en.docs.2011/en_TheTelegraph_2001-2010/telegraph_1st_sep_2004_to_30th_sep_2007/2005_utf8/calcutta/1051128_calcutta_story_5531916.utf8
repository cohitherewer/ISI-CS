New Year special

Screen On amp; Off

 Lots of names, from Abhishek Bachchan to Shah Rukh Khan to Sachin Tendulkar, have been floated as to who would slip into the hot seat for the New Year?s special on Kaun Banega Crorepati . 

 Well, the wait is over. Five Nach Baliye couples ? the popular dance show on STAR One ? would sit for Fastest Finger First (FFF) from which two will make it to the hot seats to face quizmaster Amitabh Bachchan.

 The five couples have been randomly chosen mainly on the basis of availability on the day of the episode shoot. So the participants are Varun Badola and Rajeshwari Sachdev, Sachin and Supriya Pilgaonkar, Rohit and Mansi Joshi Roy, Manish Goyal and Poonam Goyal, and Apurva Agnihotri and Shilpa Saklani.

 The one who wins the FFF will get to choose his partner for the quiz and he or she may not be his or her spouse. The prize money will obviously go to charity.

 As for the normal KBC, with just three days left ? till Wednesday ? for phone-ins, there is now a real rush among callers with the fastest fingers.

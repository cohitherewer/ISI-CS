The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A week to repair the roof

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The Metro grab

 The dome might not be draped, after all. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), responsible for the upkeep of Victoria Memorial Hall, offered on Thursday to repair the monument?s leaky roof within a week. Failing this, it could be wrapped with polythene sheets, as decided earlier by the court.

 ASI experts directly involved in maintaining the edifice told the division bench of Justice A.K. Ganguly and Justice Tapan Dutta that they were concerned after a computer graphic of the dome swathed in polythene sheets appeared in Metro a week ago.

 The image was prompted by the court order directing the Memorial authorities to consider wrapping the dome to stop seepage of water and protection of valuables.

 ?Wrapping the dome with polythene sheets will not only make the monument look odd, it is also quite impossible to stop seepage of rainwater by the process,? the lawyer representing the ASI told the court.

 A report was placed before the bench during the day by ASI?s superintendent archaeologist Bimal Bandopadhyay, seeking a week?s time to take temporary measures to prevent water seepage.

 ?Please give us a week?s time. The joints and cracks are being sealed and the broken glass is being repaired with appropriate adhesives. The outer surface of the damaged areas will be sprayed with waterproof liquid containing silicon-siloxane solvent,? Bandopadhyay told the court.

 In his report, the archaeologist said in view of the court directive relating to seepage of water inside the Memorial, ASI engineers had carried out a thorough examination of the roof and dome and studied a report on suggested urgent measures on prevention.

 ?Owing to lack of maintenance, the glass covers (fitted on the dome for circulation of air) are broken in some places,? the report stated.

 After hearing the plea, the judges granted the ASI a week?s time to complete temporary repairs.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Held for fake marks

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 A 20-year-old youth was arrested for submitting a counterfeit marksheet to gain admission in a city college.

 Nitya Nanda Naskar was arrested following a complaint lodged by the Surendranath College authorities on Monday. 

 The young man?s marksheet ? bearing the Bihar Education Intermediate Council stamp ? had been sent for verification prior to seeking a migration certificate, the clearance needed to appear for the university exams.

 ?Naskar had taken admission during the 2003-2004 academic year in the commerce stream. He even studied in the college for a year,? said Gyanwant Singh, chief of the city detective department.

 Investigations have revealed that Naskar purchased the marksheet from one Narayan Chaatua for Rs 10,000 after failing to clear the Higher Secondary examination twice. 

 A resident of Canning, in South 24-Parganas, Chaatua, who ran the Sonarpur Correspondence College, has allegedly been selling marksheets at a premium.

 Chaatua is still absconding. A man believed to be his business partner, Madhav Mondal, had been arrested earlier by Jorasanko police in connection with a fake marksheet scam. The fraud section of the detective department has taken up the case.

 This is not the first time fake marksheets have been reported to police. The detective department is also investigating a complaint lodged by the Bar Council last year against 20 practising lawyers who had fake degrees. 

 Recently police arrested a doctor, Salamat Ali, from Behala, for faking a post-graduate degree.

 During the investigation, a string of correspondence colleges in and around the city have come under the scanner, with a few arrests being made in Patna and Kankarabad, in Bihar. 

 Nagendra Prasad Singh, a 58-year-old doctorate in botany and an officer on special duty (examinations) in Magadh University, was the latest arrest. He was picked up in Gaya.

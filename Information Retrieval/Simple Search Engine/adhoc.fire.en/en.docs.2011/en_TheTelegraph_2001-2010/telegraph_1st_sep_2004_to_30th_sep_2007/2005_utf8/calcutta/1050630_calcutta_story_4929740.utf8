Life

 Keep em short

 Be it snuggling up in bed or playing beach volleyball, shorts are simple, stylish and high on comfort, says Ipsita Deb

 Its the wardrobe must-have indoors, and, if you have the confidence to carry it off, outdoors, too. Shorts are as comfy as they are trendy and, in weather like Calcutta, can be worn almost through the year.

 Teamed with a little jacket, a romantic blouse or a sentimental, sleep-in, ratty tee, shorts are no longer restricted to the beach zone.

 Today, these are available in a wide variety of lengths, sizes, colours and styles. Here is a users guide to the once juvenile half-pant, which has grown up to become a valid casual option.

 Track type

 Shorts that skim the upper thigh and are intended to provide maximum freedom of movement in sports activities are called track or running shorts. Specifically designed to provide support to runners, these are usually short in length and made of lightweight material.

 Before buying a pair, figure out what exactly you are likely to use them for. Would you want to carry items in the pockets? Are your inner thighs likely to chafe when you run? Then opt for longer shorts. If you will be running at night, shorts in bright, reflective colours are a good bet. For the monsoons, waterproof material is a must. 

 Walk ways

 Walking shorts generally are longer in length, reaching the knees. They are meant for casual wear, with pockets and waist loops for a belt. The malls and market are filled with this type of shorts and can be found in a plethora of colours and styles ? drawstring, zipped or button fly. Caribbean-look bermudas that used to be extremely popular at one time are part of this segment, too.

 Walking shorts can be used at the poolside or beach to cover ups a skimpy bathing suit. If inhibitions prevent you from showing too much by the poolside, a bikini or revealing swimsuit can be teamed with a cute pair of shorts, suggests Dharmendra Nathwani of La Lingerie.

 Chic cuts

 Cut-offs are popular with teenyboppers with a fascination for the frayed look. These are basically improvised shorts that can be made at home by cutting the legs off trousers above the knee. The edges are left loose so the fabric can fray. Denims are the most popular fabric choice in this segment.

 Hot hugs

 Short, tight athletic shorts usually made from spandex or nylon are called bun huggers or hot pants. In many schools, modified versions of these have been made mandatory under the skirt during athletic activities.

 For me, shorts are the number one sleepwear item as theyre highly comfy. The last time I sported them out of the home was on a recent holiday in Goa, says actress Nilanjanaa.

 Skirting style 

 Skorts look like skirts, but are really shorts ? often referred to as a divided skirt. They are an easy-to-manage alternative to the miniskirt, perfect for those who are conscious of conspicuously high hemlines.

 Zip zap

 Zip-off shorts seem to be the latest rage, with leading brands like Levis and Nike offering a range of styles. These are basically long pants or capris with zippers at the knee, allowing the wearer to hack their pants down to size as the weather grows warmer.

 Trend talk

 Going by international trends, bigger is better when it comes to shorts. Wearing them baggy keeps them chic, especially low on the hip and held up with a belt, says designer Priyanjali Ray.

 Go for a theme. For the bohemian style, wear shorts with camisoles and metal accessories. For a safari look, stick to animal prints. A classic jacket also lends a chic look, she adds.

 Shop stops

 Shorts can be found just about anywhere and everywhere. Sportswear stores like Nike, Reebok and Adidas or multi-brand outlets like Shoppers Stop, Westside and Pantaloons have them in plenty.

 It must be noted that the sporty ones are priced far steeper than the rest. You are likely to find a stylish and comfortable pair of shorts for anything between Rs 200 and Rs 700.

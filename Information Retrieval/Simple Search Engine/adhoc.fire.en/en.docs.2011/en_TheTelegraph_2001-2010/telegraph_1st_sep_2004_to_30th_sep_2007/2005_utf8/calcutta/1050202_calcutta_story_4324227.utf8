The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Pavilion for posterity

 - LOUVRE REPLICA TO BE RELOCATED

 SUDESHNA BANERJEE

 First, the idols of Durga puja started being preserved. Now, Calcutta?s second most exciting annual ritual is following the footsteps on the preservation path. 

 A piece of the 30th Book Fair will stay on in Calcutta. The pavilion of France, occupying the centre of the book fair and visitors? attention, will be relocated in the city. 

 ?We have decided to preserve the structure. It was so difficult to design. Instructions have been given to the constructors not to demolish it,? says Mahendra Jalan, honorary consul of France in Calcutta. 

 The transparent pyramid, resembling a greenhouse, will host art exhibitions. ?It will come up in a garden near a factory and will be exclusively used as a space for the exhibition of modern art,? said Nicolas Blasquez, director of Alliance Francaise de Calcutta. 

 The use is apt, considering the original is so closely linked to the biggest citadel of art in the world. ?The structure at the Book Fair is a replica of the entrance of the Louvre Museum in Paris,? says Manish Chakraborti of Continuity, who won a contest to design the pavilion. Interestingly, the museum authorities had also selected the pyramid design through a competition. Celebrated architect I.M. Pei came up with the winning design solution in 1989.

 ?The transparency of the structure creates a sense of visual continuity. Visitors can see the adjacent stalls. The pyramidal shape gives it solidity of structure,? he explains.

 The pavilion, which has been attracting visitors for its unique look, follows the proportions of the original glass structure. ?It is more than half in size,? Chakraborti says. 

 But in place of glass, 250 acrylic sheets have been used, along with eight tonnes of steel. There is no column and the tip of the pyramid rises to 30 feet unsupported. ?We had to use bamboo scaffolding during the construction so that people could climb up and work.?

 Chakraborti and his team are elated at the decision. ?We were planning to sell it as scrap. So, it is great to know that it will be preserved.?

 The new location of the pyramid is being kept under wraps right now. But the French embassy, in the words of cultural attach? Jerome Neutres, is ?very happy and very proud? that a bit of Book Fair history is being scripted in the process.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Big stage, small screen

What is good in one medium is often not suitable for 

another. Case in point: film award shows on television

Shiloo Chattopadhyay

It 

was Sheila who realised it first. Oh my god, we are due for dinner tonight at 

your brother?s. Anish called to check. Could they have the dinner tomorrow? The 

answer was music to his ears ? the dinner was always scheduled for Sunday. Freedom 

that evening meant a lot to Anish and Sheila. Both of them desperately wanted 

to watch the awards function that Saturday evening. All the big film stars would 

be there. 

The show ended nearly at midnight. They had sat through 

it, but just about. Every item on the show made them hope that the next one would 

be better. That hope kept them going. In any case, switching to one of the movie 

channels was not such a tempting idea. It was too late to go out. So they had 

to stay with the show till the end.

That, in a way, was curious. The appetisers on preceding 

days did their jobs admirably. The menu for the day looked delicious on the card. 

The promises made were kept, at least in word if not in spirit. A popular star 

was roped in as the host of the show. Award presentations by celebrities were 

justifiably the spine of the show. And then there were song-and-dance performances 

by superstars. All this on a stage that was as lavish as any Sanjay Leela Bhansali 

film. Phenomenal efforts were made to enhance the production values of the show 

through light, fireworks, costumes, sound quality, et al. There was very little 

apparent reason for this fare to be less than fulfilling for the audience

True, the apparent reasons were few. Boring acceptance 

speeches, stale jokes by the emcee were some of the favourite cribs. Perhaps the 

most striking was the response to dance performances by the stars. Many said that 

they appeared to be dancing in slower motion. That is, however, understandable. 

The benchmark in the audience mind is after all the multi-take, dance master-assisted 

performances that stars dish out on the silver screen. Most stars are possibly 

great dancers as long as they take one step at a time.

These possibly are reasons enough for many to feel 

let down. The not-so-apparent reason however is a more serious culprit. Most of 

us have seen a Kathakali dancer. He uses a very heavy and loud make-up. Such make-ups, 

I have been told, accentuate the facial expressions and communicate them over 

longer distances. In stage performance, it enhances the appeal of the dance even 

to the people sitting on the last row. Yet, the same make-up on a close-up shot 

on TV could look horrible, even scary.

The point really is very simple. What is good and 

works brilliantly in one medium need not necessarily be the most suitable for 

another medium.

The film awards possibly suffer from a lack of appreciation 

of this malaise. The sponsors possibly design a fantastic stage show. The sets 

and the lights and the music and the ambience perhaps make it an evening to remember. 

At least for those who attend the function. We sitting on the other side of the 

TV set unfortunately get a whiff of that but do not get the whole meal. That makes 

it even more frustrating. Admittedly it is a tough ask, designing a stage show 

that also looks good on TV.

If that sounds like an impossibility, then a choice 

has to be made. We all know which side of the bread is buttered. Eyeballs in front 

of the TV sets are far more in number than those in front of the TV cameras during 

the award function. And we all know that only numbers watching the TV bring in 

the moolah.

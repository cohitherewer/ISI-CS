Cast members of Sin City with director Robert Rodriguez: 

Power-packed platform

 UTV, which introduced the studio model of bringing production and distribution under one corporate umbrella, acquired the Miramax library for commercial exploitation recently. And India is reaping the celluloid rewards. Coming up next is Sin City, set to release across India this June.

 In the first weekend of April, Miramax?s ultra-stylish crime noir, Sin City, hit the jackpot powering its way to number one at the North American box office, leaving the Queen Latifah comedy, Beauty Shop, to debut in the second place. Sin City joins the year?s top films like Hitch, Robots and The Pacifier as fresh material pulling in moviegoers.

 According to Gitesh Pandya of www.boxofficeguru.com, Sin City was launched with an estimated $28.1 million marking the third largest April debut ever. Directed by Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller, the thriller opened in 3,230 theatres and averaged a sizzling $8,707 per site, giving Miramax its first number one debut since last August?s Hero. 

 Sin City, a big-screen adaptation of Miller?s graphic novel series, used live actors with computer-generated sets to deliver a new look and feel in movies and powered well ahead of the $15.6 million opening of last September?s Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow which used similar film-making techniques. 

 Reviews were positive for Sin City, which brought together a potent ensemble cast including Bruce Willis, Jessica Alba, Mickey Rourke, Benicio Del Toro, Clive Owen and Elijah Wood.

Amisha Patel: In Rani?s footsteps

 After Rani Mukherjee, it?s time for Amisha Patel to follow the signs. The Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai girl is all set to do a Black by playing a mute girl in Harry Baweja?s next film simply titled Mute. Yes, another English title all right. Amisha, who has been totally out of form in her recent films like Elaan and Vaada, should get support from her Gadar co-star Sunny Deol who plays the leading man in Mute. 

 Produced by Pammi Baweja and written and directed by Harry, Mute has Amisha playing a shocked murder witness who is brought back to normalcy by Sunny. The actress, who has been more in the news for suing her parents over property rights and discussing marriage dates with director Vikram Bhatt, has already started taking special sign language classes to get the nuances right.

 The other attraction of Mute is Neha Dhupia who plays an important role. While Harry?s adaptation of I Am Sam in Main Aisa Hi Hoon is yet to release, Mute should take some time to hit the theatres. But can Amisha pull of a Rani? Let?s keep quiet and allow her to do the talking.

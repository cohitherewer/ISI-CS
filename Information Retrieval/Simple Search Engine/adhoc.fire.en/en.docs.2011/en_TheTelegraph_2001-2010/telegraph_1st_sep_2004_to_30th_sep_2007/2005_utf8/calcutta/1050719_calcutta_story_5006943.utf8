 The City Diary

 State transport minister Subhas Chakraborty told the Assembly on Monday that his department will withdraw trams from 18 km of the total 68 km of tram tracks in the city. ?We have decided to maintain 50 km of tram tracks in the city. Trams will be phased out from the remaining parts of the routes,? Chakraborty said. 

 Our department had decided to lay tram tracks on the Taratala flyover, which is still being constructed. But the Centre has declared Diamond Harbour Road a national highway. Hence, there is doubt whether we will be able to lay tracks on the flyover, as it will be under the jurisdiction of the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI). If NHAI allows us to lay the tracks, we will go ahead with our plan,? the minister added.

 Five persons were sentenced to rigorous life imprisonment by a fast track court in Howrah on Monday. Prabir Kayal, Pratap Kayal, Pranab Kayal, Pradip Kayal and his wife Archana Kayal were also fined Rs 500 each.

A severely-injured Bagani died in Calcutta Medical College and Hospital on February 28.

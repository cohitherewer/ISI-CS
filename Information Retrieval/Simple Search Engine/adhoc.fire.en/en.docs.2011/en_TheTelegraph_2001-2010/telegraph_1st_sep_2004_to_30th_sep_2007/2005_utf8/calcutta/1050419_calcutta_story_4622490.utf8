 Calcutta is ready to roll. With a title at stake.

 Come April 23 and 24, the curtains will go up on the city?s own roller-skating championship. Clown Town, the fun destination down south, will host the show that has already attracted about 150 registrations.

 ?The whole idea is to promote roller-skating as a sport. The climate of India, with its tropical summers, is not conducive to outdoor sports through the year. Skating can keep people fit and busy,? explains Sanjay Maheswari, director of Clown Town.

 The championship will take place on the spacious go-karting track that lends itself to the event. There are two disciplines: speed-skating (for individuals) and artistic skating (for both groups and individuals). Participation has been divided into multiple age-groups ? four to eight years, eight to 12 years, 12 years and above. 

 A special category ? fun-skating ? has been introduced for kids just getting the feel of their wheeled footgear. This will involve a fancy dress contest on skates for beginners.

 Clown Town already has an ice-skating rink, but it is roller-skating that is hit material. ?While ice-skating is expensive and can be done only in the rink, one can do roller-skating anywhere. In Delhi, many schools and clubs have the facility, but Calcutta?s problem is the lack of infrastructure. People only have their parking lots to practise in,? points out Maheswari.

 Former national champion Pradip Ganeriwal recalls the years between 1960 and 1980 when the city had multiple rinks ? the Moira Street rink at Hindi High School, Ice Skating Rink at Modern High School, Burrabazar Yubak Samity near Mahajati Sadan and the one at Children?s Little Theatre.

 ?The Moira rink used to be crammed with 150-200 skaters. Sometimes they had to put up house-full boards,? recounts Ganeriwal. The decline in popularity began once the major rinks were closed to skating. As president of the National Roller Skating Federation of India, Ganeriwal also rues the lack of infrastructure, coaching and funds. He promises the Clown Town championship ?all technical assistance?, if approached for advice.

 Madhuchhanda Mookerjee of Zenith Roller-Skating Academy, from where as many as 45 students have signed up for the championship, is agog over such a contest. ?In the absence of any local contest, students had to appear straight for the national championship. The selections became like a state-level contest. The children could hardly form an idea about where they stand with regard to their competitors. This worked against them in the nationals.?

 Mayuri G., a Class V student of Mahadevi Birla for Girls, is putting in three-four hours? practice every day. ?We hope to get all the medals,? announces the girl, who is participating in two group events and the artistic skating section, where she will be performing Bharatanatyam on skates.

 While the Nava Varsha weekend saw Mayuri and friends hanging out at Clown Town for long hours, on weekdays she is travelling there straight from school. ?Tired? We are enjoying it,? the 10-year-old speaks up for the gang on wheels.

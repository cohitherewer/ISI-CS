The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Ethnic edge to winter wear

Boutique Buys

Chic, bright and vibrant ? if that defines the look 

you want to flaunt this season, then your wardrobe can get a refill from Hugli, 

a lifestyle store with designer clothes and accessories from across the country. 

?Ringing in the New Year with a lot of vibrant colours 

and cuts is the idea,? says owner Madhulika Khaitan. 

Doing the honours in dressing up the racks with some 

smart outfits are designer duo Jason and Abraham, and Sonali Mansinka with her 

label Just Urban. A lot of young designers have found place in the exclusive store 

this year, too. 

?From gypsy skirts to sophisticated evening wear, 

there?s something for everyone,? says Madhulika. The fabric is predominantly silk, 

the hues are dark, ranging from black and purple to red and wine. Jackets by Abraham 

 amp; Thakore and brocade blouses will help beat the winter chill in style. 

Apart from western outfits, ethnic wear in the form 

of one-a-piece saris from down south and silks adorned with kantha work 

are available off the racks. ?We also have reversible kantha dupattas 

and stoles, which are a hit,? adds Madhulika. 

If the outfits warm up your wardrobe, the home d?cor 

items in aluminium, glass and ceramic can work wonders in the house. From colourful 

stone wall-hangings to bright ceramic and glass pots and lanterns, the options 

are varied. 

Natural fibre products like reversible bamboo grass 

mats and flower holders are a must-see.

Bright focus

Yet another young National Institute of Fashion Technology 

(NIFT) graduate setting out in search of success. Indrani Biswas, a textile design 

student, has launched her signature boutique, Indrani?s (258B Rashbehari Avenue, 

opposite Bharat Seva Sangha), with a range of eye-catching women?s ethnic wear. 

?Though textile design was my area of study, I shifted 

to fashion design,? says she. Indrani?s forte is texturing and printing. ?I adorn 

my garments with embroidery on prints,? she says, of her heavily-sequined and 

stone-studded products. 

Zardosi and ari work are the two most 

commonly used embroidery types. ?Both forms create a rich look as much as to give 

the clothes a different character.? 

Bright colours dominate the crepes and georgettes 

that form the mainstay of the collection. 

Cottons will make a splash in summer. ?The reds and 

oranges are doing well in Calcutta now. In summer, more subtle tones have to be 

used,? adds Indrani.

Dual role

If you?re on a New Year shopping spree, make a stop 

at M amp;S, a 14-month-old boutique set up and run by mother-daughter duo Megha 

and Saroj Dalmia in New Alipore. The ethnic and semi-formal wear outlet is hosting 

its first annual sale with 50 per cent discount on everything, from saris to ponchos 

and menswear.

?We have not had a clearance sale before. This is 

an effort to broaden our client base,? explains Megha, who has taken a step forward 

in designing with the launch of her new range of bridal lehngas. 

Check out the heavily-embroidered evening wear salwar 

kurtas, up for grabs at Rs 3,000, down from the original price of Rs 6,000. 

Ladies could try the Preity Zinta look with colourful cotton jholas and 

trendy flat chappals (remember Lakshya?).

There?s something for the guys, too, with linen shirts 

at Rs 1,000.

The new entrants on the racks are ponchos in crepes 

with heavy embroidery. ?These ponchos in bright, party colours go well with brocade 

pants,? suggests Megha. 

Her skirts in raw silk embellished with metal coins 

and patchwork are bright and funky.

 The short contrast blouses to go with the skirts 

give the outfits an Indo-western look, fit for both family functions and nights 

out.

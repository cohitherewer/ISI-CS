The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Talk show topper

 Kemon achhen?? A slightly accented voice asks from the other end. When the call goes through to the elegant hostess of the chic Rendezvous, a propah hello is what one expects to be greeted with. So the Bengali pleasantry is like a bolt from the blue. 

 ?Aami Bangla boltey pari. Practice nei tai bhule gechhi,? she explains, interpreting the silence as surprise. The message is clear: Simi Garewal may be linked more with television today, but she has not forgotten the big screen and her Bengal links ? Aranyer Din Ratri and Satyajit Ray, Padatik and Mrinal Sen. ?And Rabindrasangeet,? she adds emphatically. ?I can sing songs from all the operas ? Chandalika, Shyama? I learnt so much then.?

 Back to the here and now. Word is out that her talk show is coming to a close. ?I am just taking a six-month break. Earlier I used to do this after every 26 weeks. This time it has extended to 52 weeks.? She accepts that taking the show off the air means breaking a habit of viewers who have to be wooed back again when she returns. ?But I still think that it is better that I be back with fresh ideas.?

 But before leaving, Simi is treating viewers to a Rendezvous with a difference ? in fact, three episodes of it. The last one will be beamed this Sunday evening. ?The season-end finale is hilarious. It is a collage of unedited clips of my interviews. Rekha, for instance, calls me Hitler and a witch,? she laughs, adding hurriedly, ?Of course, she is a good friend.? 

 Those who have watched her 100th episode special would surely agree. But is it right to beam the risque comments too? (like Kajol?s sexual digs at Karan Johar on camera, making the latter flush with embarrassment.) 

 Simi is categorical in her defence of Rendezvous uncensored. ?My guests are well warned. I keep telling them that the camera is rolling from the moment they step on the floor. And the finale is a fun date and should be taken in that spirit.?

 Having given India its first celebrity talk show in 1997, Simi has perhaps met everyone who is someone in India. Yet, she is prompt in her choice of her favourite interviewee. ?Sushmita Sen. She is an amazing personality.? Her favourite shows are the ones with Dev Anand, A.R. Rahman, Imran Khan and the Bachchans. 

 Talk of the Bachchans brings up how she tackled Big B. If she did not probe him during the family show it was only because she had already asked him all the questions in the solo interview earlier, she protests. ?The first time he came on my show, I had asked him ?Can you give me 100 per cent?? He promised he would. And I had questioned him non-stop on Rekha. Everyone was shocked then. So how can people say I avoid unpleasant aspects? In fact, that?s the reason I started inviting family members along. They can?t bullshit in their presence!?

 She also resists the impression that Rendezvous is about a lot of hand-holding and handkerchiefs. ?I am like that with my friends as well. I empathise with my guests.?

 Seven years on, celebrity chat shows are now a dime a dozen. But Simi claims Rendezvous still holds its own. ?Our research is incredible. Before doing a show I know enough to write a biography on the person.?

 Having been an actress and a film-maker (remember Rukhsat and India?s Rajiv?) has she found her vocation as a talk-show host? ?Please don?t present me as just a talk-show host,? comes the blistering reply. ?I am not like other celebrity hosts who come in, ask a given set of questions and leave. I am involved in every stage of the production. And show me another person who can produce a season-end finale like I do!? Touch?, Simi.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A comedy of terrors

 Combining the elements of comedy, action and mystery, Naath Theatres production Kohara explores the vagaries and eccentricities of the human mind, to present a view of life that is frightful and delightful, perplexing and amusing, all at the same time. The play opens with the death of the wealthy Justice Singhania in a car crash. Six months later, Magle, his young secretary, also dies mysteriously. The Justice?s second wife, Roma, and his daughter, Shivani, who is crippled in the accident, live by themselves in a sprawling villa, looked after by Ramuchacha, an old and faithful servant. Appointed by their family-friend Dr Kapoor, Shivani?s nurse, Tanuja, arrives on the scene, sparking off a series of strange happenings in and around the Singhania villa. These, in turn, raise a number of uncomfortable questions including the suspicious nature of the two deaths and the possibility of a secret relationship between Roma and Dr Kapoor. Starring Rohini Hattangady (picture above), Manisha Kanojia, Mridul Guptaa and Priya Arya, among others, Kohara provides an answer to all these questions. Presented by Spandan.

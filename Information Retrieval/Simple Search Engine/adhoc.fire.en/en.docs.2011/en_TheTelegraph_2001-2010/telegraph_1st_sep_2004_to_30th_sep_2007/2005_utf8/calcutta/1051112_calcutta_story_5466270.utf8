 Japan fans transit dream

 - LRT bids on hold, new team to draw up feasibility report

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s infrastructure dream, the light rail transit (LRT) system, now has a definite Japanese connection.

 Experts from Japan landed in the city on Friday to begin a six-month techno-feasibility study of the system.

 This comes after the government received bids from nearly a dozen national and international companies for the Rs 2,400-crore project.

 ?We are going to put the offers we have received on hold in view of the current developments,? said transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury.

 The development he was referring to was the interest shown by the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and other Japanese players in the project.

 On Friday evening, a group of officials from Japan Railway Technical Service (JARTS) met chief minister Bhattacharjee at Writers? Buildings and discussed the project in detail.

 ?He explained to us his LRT dream and what role it plays in his vision for a modern mass transit system in Calcutta,? revealed a spokesperson for the Japanese foreign office who led the delegation.

 ?We sought a loan from the JBIC for the Rs 2,400-crore project in the financial year 2006-07. It has asked us to get a techno-feasibility report done first. JARTS, a public consulting agency supported by the Japanese government, will conduct the study,? elaborated Chowdhury.

 During its two-week stay in town, the team will study the nature and volume of Calcutta traffic and collect relevant data on the transport system. It will also study the route alignment for the project.

 Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) is already preparing a project report, officials added.

 ?The JARTS team will be in Calcutta again in February before it tables the report. Once we get the report, we will submit it to the Centre, which will forward it to the bank,? said an official.

 The government is expecting JBIC to fund 85 per cent of the Rs 2,400-crore project.

 The Bengal government has been lobbying with Delhi to get Japanese funding for either the East-West Metro or the LRT project.

 For the latter project, the government had got a draft feasibility report prepared by the private firm Consulting Engineering Services, and submitted it to Delhi.

 But the Japanese bank had ?temporarily rejected the proposal?, saying it would be considered later. According to officials at Writers? Buildings, the report had failed to address some key technical issues.

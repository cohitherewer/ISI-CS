 City of antiquity

 Fascinated by the ancient townscape and unique human character of Varanasi, painter Tapas Ghosal has made the city the chosen destination of his artistic pilgrimage. Varanasi, the ongoing exhibition of his paintings, showcases some works from a series that he executed to express and share his personal impressions of this holy abode. Instead of depicting a panoramic view of the bathing ghats, as traditionally done by other artists, Ghosal has confined his vision to the superb beauty of Varanasi?s massive, lonely architecture and some interesting profiles of ordinary people. Painted in acrylic, his canvas portrays dilapidated, solitary houses that are endowed with a dimension of magic and mystery through the interplay of light and shade. Spontaneous, lyrical lines, filled with bold strokes in vibrant shades, characterise his paintings of buildings and houses, whether inhabited or abandoned and on the verge of ruin. The objects, which lie strewn across his desolate rooms and yards, have deformed, exaggerated shapes, that give them an air of supernatural reality coupled with imagination and fantasy. Evoking a strong sense of the antiquity of a holy city, these imageries, however, fill the viewer?s mind with emotional emptiness.

 Event: An exhibition of paintings by Tapas Ghosal

 When: Till November 30, 2 pm - 7 pm

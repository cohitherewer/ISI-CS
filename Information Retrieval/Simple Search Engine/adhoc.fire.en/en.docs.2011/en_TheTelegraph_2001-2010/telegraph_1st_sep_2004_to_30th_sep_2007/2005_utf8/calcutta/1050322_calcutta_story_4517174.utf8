 Girls? night out with boyfriends in tow. That?s how the ladies night at Virgose panned out last week.

 ?It would be so stupid to have a ladies? night without the men around! I think men help spice up such nights,? were some of the giggles doing the rounds.

 The HHI authorities had no choice but to bend the rules and allow the men in.

 Post-11 pm, it was time for Bin tere sanam, Dhoom machale, Kaanta laga and Kaliyon ka chaman as DJ Sunny Sarid took to the console. By now the girls had thrown caution to the winds and hit the dance floor with a vengeance.

 A fashion show of sorts, featuring Tejas Gandhi creations, added to the fun. Girls got an eyeful of their next party wardrobe in the designer skirts, kurtis and ponchos in cotton-silks and lots of other colourful weaves and prints.

 Gem jazz

 Art Karat, one of the pioneers in semi-precious jewellery, has brought out its latest collection of designer gems. A mix of semi-precious stones and gold-plated silver jewellery, the designs combine Indian as well as western elements. 

 Asha Kamal Modi, who designed the line, believes in ?liberating women from their obsession with gold?. 

 The handcrafted line of necklaces, earrings, bracelets and armlets dazzle in an array of gems like turquoise, amethyst, ruby, emerald, coral and sapphire.

 The motifs are largely natural as Modi draws inspiration from the ?elements of nature and its changing moods?.

 Star spot

 If Pakistani cricketers were busy getting their fashion facts right at a city salon last week, shopping was high on the agenda of Bollywood actresses visiting the city. Take Waheeda Rehman for instance, who took out time from the shooting of Aparna Sen?s 15, Park Avenue, to set out on a hunt for some ?trademark Bengal saris?. The actress stopped by at Earthy Myths, designer Sucheta Mehr?s Loudon Street studio, to pick up three kota saris with batik work.

 Says an excited Sucheta: ?Waheeda Rahman was looking for saris that have some elements from Bengal, yet not the typical tangail or dhakai. And she liked my combination of batik on kota.?

 The saris are part of the designer?s spring-summer collection. Lots of kota and organza make up the ?nine to five? range of saris for working women, while embroidered georgettes comprise the cocktail line. 

 Drapes embellished with layered prints, combinations of graphic and floral motifs, along with a hint of embroidery make up the casual line. The eveningwear range boasts heavy embroidery and are teamed with ornate blouses.

 If the palette is vibrant for saris, white and ice-cream colours rule Sucheta?s line of churidar-kurtas. Designed especially for Holi, the sets have pastel embellishments on a white base. Gota, aari, crochet, patchwork and beads adorn the garments, along with a hint of prints here and there. Crushed dupattas accompany the cotton, crepe and voile kurtas.

 The saris are priced between Rs 1,300 and Rs 8,500, while the kurta sets range from Rs 1,200 to Rs 5,000.

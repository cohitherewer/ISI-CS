It?s not often that quizmasters can be at the receiving 

end of quiz questions. In other words, looking for answers as participants. Last 

week, at an informal quiz at Tollygunge Club conducted by four quizmasters, this 

columnist enjoyed being on the other side. I wouldn?t mind a public self pat-on-the-back, 

to let you know that our team won the event. Here are some questions from that 

quiz. 

QUESTIONS

1. What was the name of the terrorist group 

that killed 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics?

2. Who would participate at a ?crufts show??

3. What is the difference between Vaseline 

and petroleum jelly?

4. Which infamous incident took place at the 

Test match held at Faisalabad, Pakistan, in 1987? 

5. In The Ramayana, who was the sister 

of Ram?

6. Which Dan Brown book is largely based in 

the Vatican City and Rome?

TOPI-CAL

Sabbati-Cal The 

golf course at the Tollygunge Club is noted for its water hazards. One of the 

more difficult holes is the 321 yards, par four fourteenth, sometimes referred 

to as Hydrophobia. In order to tackle this hole, a player has to cross over a 

large water tank to approach the green on the other side. Another test of a golfer?s 

skill at the Tolly is the 491 yards dog-legged seventh, also called Devil?s Elbow.

ANSWERS

1. Black September; 2. Dogs; 3. No difference; 4. 

The flare up between English cricketer Mike Gatting and Pakistani umpire Shakoor 

Rana; 5. Shanta; 6. Angels and Demons

 A Ray bouquet of three

 - Films digitally re-mastered amp; restored abroad for mid-January re-release 

 RESHMI SENGUPTA

 Satyajit Ray: Rerun 

 Ray is returning to the big screens this winter, brighter than ever before. Three restored Satyajit Ray films ? Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne, Aranyer Din Ratri and Pratidwandi ? will be re-released in mid-January by those who had financed these projects some 35 winters ago. Called Salaam Satyajit, the bouquet of three will be unveiled on January 11 by Speaker Somnath Chatterjee at Priya cinema with a screening of Aranyer Din Ratri.

 The three films had been released in successive years ? Goopy Gyne? in 1968, Aranyer? in 1969 and Pratidwandi in 1970, by Purnima Pictures and Priya Films. The first, starring Tapen Chatterjee and Rabi Ghosh, had gone on to enjoy ?a 52-week, all-shows housefull run?, and had to be forcibly pulled out because of the pile-up of new releases.

 ?The viewing quality will definitely be better than what it was during their first release. The films have been digitally re-mastered and restored in Germany and the US, and each print has cost Rs 1.5 lakh,? says Arijit Dutta of Piyali Films, armed with three prints of Goopy Gyne? and one each of Aranyer Din Ratri and Pratidwandi.

 Commercial release will follow on January 13 at Priya and Navina in the south, Talkie Show House in the north, Roxy or INOX (Forum) in central, and INOX (City Centre) or 89 Cinemas in Salt Lake.

 The plan is to rotate the masterpieces at the five venues, starting off with Aranyer Din Ratri at Priya. ?We will have Goopy Gyne at Navina, Talkie and at Roxy or INOX (Forum), and maybe put Pratidwandi in INOX (City Centre). The box-office collections will determine the run of the films,? says Dutta, who will check out the projection quality at the halls to ensure that the prints are not damaged.

 Salaam Satyajit will ride high on a carefully-crafted publicity blitz, with about ?40 billboards, 20,000 posters and 400 kiosks? plastered around town. ?This apart, T-shirts, coffee mugs and film posters will be sold as Ray memorabilia,? says Kanchan Dutta of Inner Circle, steering the promotional campaign. If Calcutta responds to the re-release, the restored prints will travel to other metros.

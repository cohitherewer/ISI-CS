 With the civic elections nearing, the political parties have already started painting graffiti and pasting posters on walls in support of their candidates. After the the previous Parliamentary elections, while some politicians had taken up the task of removing graffiti and posters on the walls, many had not bothered. After the coming election, both the voters and party supporters should remind the politicians, irrespective of whether they win or lose, to remove the graffiti and posters put up in their support.

 Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

 Behala. 

 I attended a function to mark Rabindranath Tagore?s birth anniversary at Nazrul Mancha. I was there from 9.30 am to 11.15 am. Sadly, the audience count was only around 200, whereas the capacity of the auditorium is much more than that. Though the programme was well organised and I enjoyed myself thoroughly, the turnout at the programme was very disappointing.

 Prantik Sanyal,

 SP Mukherjee Road. 

 The bus depot near Shahid Minar for long-distance state and private buses is filthy. After a shower, water accumulates in various spots and also forms small pools of slush. There is no proper waiting room, which causes much distress to the elderly and women passengers. Toilets are inadequate and dirty. The depot caters to a large number of buses on numerous routes and is easily accessible as it is located in the heart of the city. The authorities should provide better amenities here.

 Bhupendra Nath Bose,

 Dum Dum Park. 

 Many people ride their bicycles on railway platforms at various stations, which is very risky, both for the riders and passengers. The railway authorities should not allow people to enter the platform with bicycles.

 Mahesh Prasad,

 Baidyabati. 

 The procedure of investing in the government?s small savings schemes is quite easy but their redemption on maturity is a cumbersome process. To get the proceeds of Indira Vikash Patra on maturity, one would need to spend at least three to four hours at the GPO. One has to queue up twice at the same counter ?once for submitting the certificate against a token and thereafter, getting the money against the token. It is high time that the working of government departments offices and post offices be made more customer friendly. I hope that the authorities will take steps to streamline the procedure. 

 Raj Bagri, 

 Ho Chi Minh Sarani.

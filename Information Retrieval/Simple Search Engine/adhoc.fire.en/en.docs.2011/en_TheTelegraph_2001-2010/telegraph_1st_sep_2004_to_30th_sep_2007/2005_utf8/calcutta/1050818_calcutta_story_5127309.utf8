The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Our lives, my film

 Satabdi Roy with actor Abhishek Chatterjee on the sets of her directorial debut

 Giving a shot and waiting for the director?s call took on a different meaning for actor Abhishek Chatterjee on Wednesday. For it was co-star and friend Satabdi Roy monitoring the shoot and shouting ?action? or ?cut? at an apartment building on Prince Anwar Shah Road.

 Years after Aparna Sen made the move from acting to direction, yet another Tollywood heroine has been bitten by the film-making bug. ?I was planning to get into direction for quite some time. Being an actress, you still feel you are carrying out somebody else?s vision and I wanted to come out with my own ideas, too. I think every artiste has this kind of an urge within him or her,? Satabdi told Metro after wrapping up her first day?s work in the director?s chair.

 The yet-untitled film will star Satabdi, Abhishek, Rabi Shankar (Satabdi?s leading man in her latest release Dwiragamon) and newcomer Eleena. The rest of the cast will be finalised before the crew hits the floors for the second schedule in September.

 ?There will be three or four of us in the lead. Today?s shoot was meant to kick off the film in an auspicious season,? added Satabdi, who has also penned the script for her debut.

 For the central idea, she didn?t look far as she felt her own work experience provided enough screen substance. ?It?s a story on film artistes and their life. So there?s a hero, an actress, a producer and a director. It?s not based on any particular actor or actress?s life, but yes, since I have been in the industry for 20 years, a lot of my experience has gone into it. For instance, the fact that a film artiste doesn?t have any personal life. But it?s not a film within a film,? she clarified.

 The script will allow enough room to shoot real-life stars in action. And for this, Satabdi is drawing up a list of stars for special appearances.

 ?I am sure none of my colleagues will turn me down if I ask them for a guest appearance. I am thinking of Tapas Pal, Jisshu Sengupta and some others,? she laughed.

 Anchored on a budget of Rs 60-70 lakh, Satabdi?s film will be a commercial venture with six songs. But unlike the regular fare, the songs in this film will carry the story forward, she insisted.

 The debutante director claims to have picked up the film-making craft by watching those who have directed her. The two veterans Satabdi has in mind are Tarun Majumder and Tapan Sinha, under whom she has given her cinematic best.

 ?I want to make films like Tarunda and Tapanda who can convey their message as well as reach out to everyone. For me, the challenge will be to translate my thoughts on to the screen,? said Satabdi.

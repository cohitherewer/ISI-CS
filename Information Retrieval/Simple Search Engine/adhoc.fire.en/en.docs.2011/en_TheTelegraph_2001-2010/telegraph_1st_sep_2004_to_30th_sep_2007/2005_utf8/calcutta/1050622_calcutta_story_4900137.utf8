 What We are Watching

 Guide (1957)

 Director Vijay Anand

 Cast Dev Anand, Waheeda Rahman, Kishore Sahu, Leela Chitnis

 Plot Raju Guide (Dev) comes into the life of Rosie (Waheeda), who wants to break free from a failed marriage with the old and indifferent Marco (Sahu). The two fall in love and start living together but what follows is an emotional tale of misunderstanding, deception and retribution.

 Based on the popular novel by R.K. Narayan, Guide was made into an English version, directed by Tad Danielski. It was released beforehand but even the nude scene featuring a Waheeda body double couldn?t salvage the flop.

 Sahu was also a noted film-maker of the 1940s who directed the Meena Kumari hit Dil Apna Aur Preet Parayi.

 Chetan Anand was to direct first. Then Raj Khosla was considered but his fight with Waheeda over Solva Saal resulted in Vijay Anand directing Guide.

 R.K. Narayan disowned the film after watching it with so many changes incorporated by Vijay. Even the setting was shifted from Malgudi to Udaipur.

 The song Tere mere sapne was canned in just four shots with complex character and camera movements. 

 Mr amp; Mrs Smith (2005)

 Director Doug Liman

 Cast Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie

 Plot A married couple (Pitt and Jolie) are getting bored with their quiet domestic life. What they don?t know is that they?re both assassins, secretly hopping the world and killing for hire. But their separate lives are about to collide when both are assigned to kill the same man.

 Nicole Kidman was originally cast as Mrs Smith and even Catherine Zeta-Jones was considered for the role. As for Mr Smith, Johnny Depp and Will Smith were considered.

 There was an Alfred Hitchcock film with the same title in 1941.

 When the Smiths are questioning their former apparent target Benjamin, he is wearing a T-shirt with the logo Fight Club, a Brad Pitt film.

 The script of the film went through a record 50 drafts with uncredited writers like Michelle Mulroney, Jez Butterworth and Steven Zallian chipping in.

 Many of the shots shown in the trailers of the movie ? Brad Pitt riding a bike while shooting ? were not there in the film.

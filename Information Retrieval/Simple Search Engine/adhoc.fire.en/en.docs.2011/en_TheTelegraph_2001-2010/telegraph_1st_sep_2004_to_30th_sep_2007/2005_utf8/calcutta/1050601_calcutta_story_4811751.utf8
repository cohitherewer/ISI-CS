 The City Diary

 Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty will meet various transport organisations and operators on June 8 to discuss a recent order banning pre-1990 commercial vehicles in the city. 

 All transport operators had urged the minister to review the order as around two-third of the vehicles were procured before 1990. Chakraborty, however, said on Tuesday that the government was determined to ban all polluting vehicles. ?Any commercial vehicle which is more than 15 years old will not be allowed to ply. I will try my best to help transport operators, but not at the cost of the environment,? he asserted.

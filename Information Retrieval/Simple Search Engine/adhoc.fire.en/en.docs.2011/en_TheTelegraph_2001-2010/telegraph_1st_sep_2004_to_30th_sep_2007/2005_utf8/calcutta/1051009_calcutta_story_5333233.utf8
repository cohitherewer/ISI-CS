The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A Bengali at heart, at home here

 My association with Bengal and Bengalis started with my music videos ? the one with Euphoria?s Kabhi aana tu meri gali where I played a Bengali girl. The second one was a Shubha Mudgal video, Kisson ki Chadar, where I worked with Madhabidi (Mukherjee).

 I had also done a commercial with Soumitrada (Chatterjee) and Madhabidi, with Durga puja as the backdrop, and that is a favourite of mine.

 The year before Bhalo Theko, I was supposed to go to Calcutta and stay for the Pujas. But that didn?t work out? I was looking forward to coming down. Then Bhalo Theko happened, and I spent a lot of time in the city during the shoot.

 In Chembur, where I live, there?s a huge Durga puja and I have gone there on two different occasions. I like going there and just hanging around in the mandap. And the prasad they offer to the goddess is so good. Though I don?t eat out at all, I have had the prasad there.

 My next big tryst with Durga puja was through films again. This time while shooting for Parineeta. They had a huge pratima on the sets and Sanjay (Dutt) and Saif (Ali Khan) did a dhunuchi naach in front of the pratima, while we stood around watching. The festive spirit was very much there. But I wanted to know a little more about what was going on in the Puja scenes ? for instance, the details of what was being used when and why ? and found out quite a lot.

 It?s strange that time and again I end up playing roles or being associated with films that are very, very Bengali.

 It feels strange but I have always had a very strong connection with Bengal. Maybe because I used to watch a lot of Bengali films and they left a strong influence on me. I was especially fond of Satyajit Ray, Mrinal Sen, Tapan Sinha, Aparna Sen and Rituparno Ghosh. It?s all about a different culture you are learning.

 Isn?t it strange that even my first feature film was in Bengali? Bhalo Theko by Gautam Halder, where I worked with Soumitrada. I often say that I must have been a Bengali in my previous birth. 

 Some people think I say this to make a good quote, but believe me I honestly think so. I feel very Bengali at heart, I really feel very much at home in Calcutta.

 Right now, I am away in Rajasthan, shooting for Vidhu Vinod Chopra?s Eklavya, and I have no idea when I come going to go to Calcutta.

 But I am looking forward to working in more Bengali films. Let?s hope something works out and I get to meet you all in Calcutta.

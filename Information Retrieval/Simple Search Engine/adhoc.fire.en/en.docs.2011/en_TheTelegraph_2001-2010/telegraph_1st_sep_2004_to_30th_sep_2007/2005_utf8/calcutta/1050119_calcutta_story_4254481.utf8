 PC Chandra Jewellers is out to woo all women with its latest diamond collection. Dream Diamonds, the four-day exhibition, starting January 19, will showcase a wide variety of diamonds in different shapes, sizes and designs to suit diverse tastes and budgets.

 The preview was kicked off on Tuesday amid much fanfare by reigning Mrs India Shilpa Reddy. ?Each of the designs is in keeping with the latest international trends. Affordability and deft craftsmanship are other bonus points,? said Shilpa.

 Starting from heavy solitaire string necklaces to trendy designs with rhodium polish finish, coloured stones and semi-precious stones, each piece portrays an elegant look. Unusual sets of chakri (uncut diamonds) and polki (colourful beads) catch the eye among the jewels on display. 

 For those who find the sets, starting at Rs 50,000, a tad steep, there are pret earrings, in both drop and stud form, with uncut stones. Pendants flaunt artful frosting. Then there are rings, for both men and women, in solitaire and cluster styles. The latter, explains a spokesperson, is the more popular of the two, especially the Nakshatra variety.

 The bangles, starting at Rs 15,000 for a bracelet and Rs 60,000 for a pair of churis, come in a variety of styles. A recent innovation has been the formation of clusters that look like a solitaire.

 The store also offers the option of customising the rest of your jewellery to match a particular piece you might take special fancy to. 

 All in all, the exhibition, in association with the Diamond Trading Company, promises to be a great shopping experience with plenty of incentives, free gifts with every purchase of diamonds, and a chance to win gold pendants through lucky draws on the hour, every hour.

 Couture call

 Designer studio Ogaan is organising a two-day fashion extravaganza that kicked off on Tuesday. While creations from the likes of Kavita Bhartia of the label Omana, Mynah, Mayura Kumar, Couturewala and Stae form an essential part of the exclusive viewing, the exhibition will also feature some new and upcoming designs from Aparna Chandra, UP Designs and Varsha Mahendra.

 Bhartia?s creations, be it the sari, kurta or western wear, portray a distinct feminine style. While the ethnic ensembles are characterised by floral prints, sequins and embroidery, the skirts combine various fabrics, colours and prints to delicate, refined and yet trendy effect.

 The husband-wife duo of Ayan and Reetika Sarkar, under the label Couturewala, has created an unusual variety of sari and salwar suits in earthy hues, with an antique finish. ?In saris, earthy colours usually don?t work well, but I think that mental block will soon pass, what with cities like Delhi and Mumbai preferring these hues to most others,? says Ayan.

 Different dyeing techniques, zari and aari work and abstract designs characterise this line. Georgette is the reigning fabric, with a special emphasis on handloom work, Kashmiri styles and border decorations. ?I abhor uniformity and strive to create each outfit like a piece of art. I usually match shapes and embellishments randomly, without a fixed plane,? adds Ayan.

 Mayura Kumar?s kalamkari and ikkat work and her poncho-style kurta, Mynah?s sequinned Kashmiri ensembles and Aparna Chandra?s net collection with floral embroidery are other interesting designs to watch out for. Another exponent of kalamkari in this exhibition is Varsha Mahendra, who has introduced interesting tops and skirts featuring the art.

 Sabina Singh, under her label Horn OK Please, has introduced a range of short and long jackets with a dash of brocade here and a touch of embroidery there, along with prints and embellishments. UP Designs has a range priced at Rs 1,000-plus, featuring interesting trousers and jackets.

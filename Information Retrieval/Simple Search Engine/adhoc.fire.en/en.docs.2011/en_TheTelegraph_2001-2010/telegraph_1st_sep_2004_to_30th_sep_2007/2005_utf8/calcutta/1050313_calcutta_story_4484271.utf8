Star power, social service

After using celebrities to push products, its 

time to use them for altruistic benefit

Shiloo Chattopadhyay

Remember 

the Surf vs Ariel duel? Those were the days when Procter amp; Gamble was as active 

as Levers. We used to wait with baited breath for the next Surf rejoinder to the 

Ariel campaign, or vice versa. If nothing else, it used to make commercial breaks 

as interesting to watch as the main programmes.

The fight has lost its zing with Ariel mellowing in 

the media. Despite that, Surf Excel has continued to run some very interesting 

ad campaigns. The latest from Surf Excel is currently running on television. This 

is the ad where many people are seen walking with two buckets full of water. They 

then pour it into a large reservoir. At this point none other than Shabana Azmi 

informs you what a great thing this saving of water is for the country and implores 

you to use Surf Excel.

Almost as an afterthought, the stain-removing property 

of the brand is mentioned. On a couple of counts, this advertising from Surf Excel 

is noteworthy. The first inimitability, of course, lies in its use of a celebrity. 

Instances of a brand borrowing a star?s imagery are not too frequent. Sometimes 

you will find a Narain Karthikeyan doing an ad for an automotive ancillary or 

an Akshay Kumar lending his macho image to Thums Up by standing on top of what 

is supposed to be Mount Everest.

In one sense, the Surf Excel ad does nothing more 

than that. It is borrowing a star?s imagery. What is very interesting is the aspect 

of the imagery that is being borrowed. Ms Azmi as a celebrity possibly has four 

distinct facets ? an actor, the better half of a high-profile celebrity couple, 

a parliamentarian and a social activist. And, of the four, Shabana Azmi as a social 

campaigner is possibly the least suitable for normal brand advertising (as distinct 

from advertising for causes like the polio vaccine).

Even then the makers of Surf Excel in their wisdom 

has picked that. To the best of my knowledge, this is not something that has been 

done before. Of course, this time Surf had to do it. The ?reason why? being offered 

in the ad dictated it. But then it is also true that they had the choice of not 

using any celebrity.

Or did they really have that choice? Without a celebrity, 

this ad would have become an uninteresting social service campaign. A celebrity 

was needed and Shabana fitted the bill the best. In that sense, Shabana was a 

must for this ad. The interesting question is what did they use her for?

True, with her in the ad the import of water-saving 

became more enhanced. Yet, come to think of it, the main purpose for which the 

ad has used her is to add visibility and appeal to the campaign, albeit in a very 

socially sensitive context. She converted that dull do-good campaign to noticeable 

brand advertising. So it really is the same story. The motive is the same as that 

of any other run-of-the-mill celebrity campaign ? adding glamour to deliver the 

content of the ad.

Indeed, the ?reason why? itself is something of an 

enigma. It is the second count on which this ad stands out. Usually, a brand tells 

you to use it for benefits that are to be enjoyed personally or at best by your 

family. This ad is offering an altruistic benefit. Good of the nation is the cause 

why you should use Surf Excel. This itself is curious and again has not been done 

too often in the past.

Will this do-good motive work? Search me. If you are 

trying to figure out the answer yourself, all I can do is warn you: Dhoondte 

rah jaoge.

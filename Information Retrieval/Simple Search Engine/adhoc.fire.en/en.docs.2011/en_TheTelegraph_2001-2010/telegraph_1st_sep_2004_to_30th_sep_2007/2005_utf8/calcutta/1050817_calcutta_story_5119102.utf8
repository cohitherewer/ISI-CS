 Tourists scraped off bus roof, one dies

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A tourist from Nepal was killed and three others were injured in a road accident in the city early on Tuesday.

 Nasib Rai and three others were scraped off the roof of a bus, carrying tourists from Nepal, while it was passing below Kankurgachhi rail bridge around 5.45 am. 

 The driver of the bus misjudged the height of the bridge and drove under it, instead of taking the subway for big vehicles on Maniktala Main Road.

 Police sources said the bus was crammed with 65 passengers, way above its seating capacity. A number of passengers were sitting on the roof of the bus.

 The iron girdle under the rail bridge hit the four passengers from Biratnagar, in Nepal, sitting on the roof just above the driver?s cabin.

 The impact threw them off the bus. Forty-year-old Rai was killed on the spot, while Santosh Kumar Majhi, 18, Sunil Rai, 7, and Bhagrath Chowdhury, 18, were injured. 

 Local people and policemen on duty in the area helped rush the injured to hospitals.

 The other tourists were taken to Narkeldanga police station.

 While Sunil was discharged after treatment at Nilratan Sircar Medical College Hospital, Santosh and Bhagrath are stated to be in critical conditions at SSKM Hospital.

 The tourists were returning to Nepal after a daylong tour of the city. ?They were on their way back after a visit to Kalighat when the mishap occurred,? said an officer of Narkeldanga police station.

 Police later impounded the bus. ?We are looking for the driver, who is absconding,? said Vineet Goel, deputy commissioner of police (eastern suburban division).

 Constable killed

 In another accident, the head constable of Chetla police station was knocked down by a speeding truck at the Chetla Central Road-Alipore Road crossing while he was on patrol duty at around 6 am.

 The truck spun out of control and knocked down Sachidananda Panda, 54, who hailed from Purulia. He suffered head injuries and was declared ?brought dead? at SSKM Hospital. The driver fled but the vehicle was impounded.

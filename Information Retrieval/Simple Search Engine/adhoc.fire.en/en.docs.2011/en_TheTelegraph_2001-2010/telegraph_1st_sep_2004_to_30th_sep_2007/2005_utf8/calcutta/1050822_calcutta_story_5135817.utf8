 An anguished artistic vision

 Showcasing the paintings (King After Coronation; picture above) and drawings of veteran artist Rabin Mondal, the ongoing monographic exhibition is a retrospective of his works spanning a period of six decades. A sincere statement of Mondal?s art, the show, organised by Delhi Art Gallery, is his critique on time and the world. Full of violence, misery and strife, his images are far from palatable. His responses to the ugliness and decay of human relationships and the natural environment find expression in the form of muted and distorted forms that struggle in vain to conceal their perverseness. Hard-hitting and, at times, morbid, his paintings become emblems of both suffering and survival in an antagonistic world. Layered with bold, rugged textures and acidic colours, his canvases represent his scathing comment on a visibly decadent, amoral society.

 Event: An exhibition of paintings by Rabin Mondal

 When: Till August 23, 10 am - 8 pm

 Where: ITC Sonar Bangla Art Gallery

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Dublin diary of social service

 Doll Discourse: 

 A talking doll had the kids mesmerised at a show at Swabhumi on Monday evening. Performer Gautam Adhikari used the medium to educate the children on issues like pulse polio, the ills of smoking, bus passenger safety and HIV/AIDS awareness.

 Fifteen youngsters from St Xavier?s Collegiate School, led by their teachers Farino Torcatto and Amitava Biswas, took a trip to Dublin, Ireland, as part of the school?s ninth student exchange programme with Belvedere College. The purpose was social service and cultural exchange. TANMOY DAS LALA pens a diary of the days spent there for Young Metro.

 May 20 

 Departure day. The flight was at 7.35 am. By 5:30, everyone had arrived. To those who have never flown before, it was to be a new experience and under all the polished smiles was excitement. We landed at Heathrow around 2.10 pm and took the Aer Lingus flight to Dublin, arriving at 6 pm. As we walked out after collecting our luggage, we saw 15 young lads waiting for us with smiles on their faces. My host was Rory Farrell. The Xaverian friends bid adieu to each other and set forth. 

 May 21

 After a wonderful night?s sleep, I woke up wondering what I would be doing today. We were to start our community work from Monday. Rory took me to central Dublin to show me around town. On the way to the city centre, I couldn?t take my eyes off the scenery. There were beautiful shops everywhere and the condition of the roads were much better than what we are used to in Calcutta. After we got off the bus, Rory booked tickets for the Dublin city bus tour. I met two Xaverians who were in town for the same purpose. After the lovely bus trip, we headed back to O?Connell Street, one of the busiest streets in Dublin. We walked around awhile and headed home. 

 May 23

 Work starts today. Sunday passed wonderfully, but I was told to be ready by 9.30 am as I was expected to reach my work centre by 10 am. Rory?s mum, Cecily Farrell, dropped us off. I gazed at the beautiful scenery. I entered with a beating heart, nervous, scared, not knowing what to expect. But the people were warm and amiable. My workplace was TLC Centre, a home for the aged. I was introduced to my supervisor Mr Dennis. He made me feel at home. At the end of the day, it seemed like I knew everyone. The nurses and other staff helped me whenever I needed it. The first day, Rory and I shampooed the upholstery and hoovered it, after which I was asked to clean some doors and windows. I was fine, apart from a slight backache, which disappeared in a day. After lunch, Rory and I became receptionists, which was quite an experience. Post-work, all the Xaverians were asked to meet at Belvedere College to discuss the day. We did so everyday, sharing thoughts and experiences and practicing for the reception to be held on May 30. 

 May 24

 Work in the morning as usual. But today I did something different. Other people were doing the hoovering, so we made brochures. I thought the job was simple, but Rory and I landed up spending four hours making about 100 brochures. Before that, the boxes of leaflets had to be brought in, which were very heavy and it was some exercise. After work we went to Belvo (as the Irish boys call their school) for our discussion and practice and returned home. The other 14 had different work centres, and they all enjoyed their work. 

 May 25

 Today, I was introduced to Rosemary, who is in charge of various activities at the centre. She entertains the elderly occupants with games. After playing for around 45 minutes, they all seemed tired, but there was still time before lunch, so I got talking. They shared some wonderful stories with me, about their past, how they grew up in an Ireland so different from today, how they lived through the decades. It was the first day of interaction, and I was excited about the coming days. After work, it was Belvo, and then back home. 

 May 27

 Today?s activity was to shape the nails of the ladies and apply make-up. I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that despite their wrinkles, these wonderful people were no less spry than in their younger days. After the make-up session, I played a few board games with some of them. After lunch, I was asked to play the piano. As I performed, I could sense a quiet contentment among them. I had to rush to catch the bus, since I was running late. It was the last day of practice before our reception. I reached Belvedere 12 minutes late, glad to find the practice session hadn?t started yet. Everyone put in their best that evening.

May 28

 No work. Everything?s slightly lax on Saturdays. Today, several of our guest brothers who had stayed with us last November, decided to take us out. I enjoyed the time spent with my guest brother Donal Ridge and his family. It was nearly 11.30 pm when I reached Rory?s place, tired but happy.

 May 29

 Went shopping today with my host family. Dublin is an expensive city. On Grafton Street, a one-liner print T-shirt starts from 29 euros. 

 May 30

 Showtime. We were expected at Belvo by 3.30 pm. We hurried off from work as soon as we finished, flush with nervousness and fright about how the show would turn out. We practiced a little. Then there we were in front of our host brothers and their families in white kurtas and blue jeans, smiles on our faces, hiding the nervousness. Supper was served first. Then it was time to perform. First, Mr Torcatto gave his speech followed by a brief introduction to our group by Mr Biswas. We sang Heal the world, followed by Pal and Time of your life. We ended with a Bhangra performance, thoroughly enjoyed by everyone. 

 June 1

 I was really excited today as I was to go to the Gate Theatre with my host family and watch Lady Windermere?s Fan, a play by Oscar Wilde, after work. I loved it.

 June 2

 It was a sentimental day for everyone, the last day of work. We bid goodbye and returned home with heavy hearts. But we had to start packing since we had to be at the airport by 6 am the next day. That evening we went to Belvedere College, for their transition year graduation programme. All 15 of us Xaverians received a certificate each, after which we returned home. 

 June 3

 Time to say bye bye to Dublin. At 10.10 am, we were in London. Depositing our bags at the left-luggage room in terminal four, we went sightseeing. From the Marble Arch it was the Big Bus Company Sightseeing bus tour. Had it not rained, we would have enjoyed ourselves. When it subsided, we all ran abovestairs in the bus, clad in white ponchos. Despite the drizzle, we had fun. We took the red tour down Shaftsbury Avenue, Regent Street, into Piccadilly Circus and Trafalgar Square, after which it was time to visit the Parliament building, Big Ben and the London Eye. 

 June 4

 Some of the boys and the two teachers visited Madame Tussauds in the morning. Time to leave London at 3 pm. At 5.36 the next morning, we arrived in Calcutta.

 Magical moments

What is it with rain, poetry and solitude, the ingredients to spin miracles in the mind, I wondered. As the city revelled in the sudden evening showers after days of a heatwave, I sat in the auditorium of Sri Aurobindo Institute of Culture, struggling in vain to calm the butterflies in my stomach, awaiting the Kavisandhi reading session by Jayanta Mahapatra, one of the most famous Indian poets.

 The evening that unfolded was one to cherish. Instinctively, I detached myself from my friends to sit next to the sound person, with the excuse that my recorder would work better from there. And believe me, the sound person is just the neighbour for you if you want to close your eyes and immerse yourself in the solitude and let the words glide over your soul.

 Mahapatra began the session by sharing his personal background in short and his feelings about poetry ? how as a bullied and victimised child in school he sought refuge in his books, how he transformed from a physics person to a poet in his late 30s and how he believes poetry should be an expression of honesty by the poet.

 He followed up with some of his most recent and unpublished works, touching the canvas of life in as many different shades as Deaths in Orissa, Romance of Her Hand and even Madhuri Dixit. Afterwards, Pankaj Saha recited a few of Mahapatra?s poems, translated into Bengali. Finally, Mahapatra himself concluded the readings with the original and English translation of The Sprouting Grass, one of his poems in Oriya. The session was then thrown open for interaction with the audience.

 Uber-optimistic idealist that I am, I stayed back after the session to have a word with the poet. Mahapatra was busy signing copies of his books, which were on sale at the spot. But for this poor, cash-strapped schoolkid who had read his poems from an anthology and worshipped him, he agreed to sign my well-thumbed book. 

 When I further demanded he sign right next to The Vase, my favourite poem by him, he obliged with: ?That?s your favourite? It?s one of my favourites too!? And then, he left the humble hardly-a-poet in me positively dumbstruck with his enthusiastic: ?Mail me your works, I?ll be glad to see them.?

 As I walked on air on my way back home that evening, I knew rain, poetry and solitude had spun miracles once again.

 Correction

 The account of Malli Mastan Babu?s trek to Everest base camp was a very interesting and thrilling read (Savour the splendour, Young Metro, June 17). He has given a very descriptive account of the journey. It will perhaps inspire other youths (and some elderly enthusiasts, too) to venture out. I greatly appreciate his story. However, trekking to high altitudes and mountaineering are expensive activities, and the author didn?t talk about the cost factor. Also, the two photographs with the caption ?The different moods of Mt Everest? are not of Everest. The one above is Amadablam and the other below could be anywhere on the way, but not the Mt Everest peak.

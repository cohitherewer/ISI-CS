 - Screening gadget analyses structure, pressure points

 SUBHRO SAHA

 At your doorstep, David Beckham?s advantage

 What helps power a typical David Beckham bender, a trademark Marat Safin whiplash forehand, or a Sachin Tendulkar cover drive, is now at your feet.

 A novel screening technology that analyses foot structure and records its dynamic movements and pressure points, promises to help Calcutta consumers better understand the unique needs of their feet during motion and make an informed choice when they next shop for shoes.

 Launched at the Forum store of Adidas from Monday as a free service, the Footscan technology pioneered by Adidas-Salomon AG, is ?an information tool?. It comes from a company that had powered Jesse Owens? four-gold glory run at the Berlin Olympics and now boasts some of the biggest names in world sports as brand ambassadors.

 ?Footscan is designed to make the consumers understand how the foot behaves and tell them what kind of cushioning or stability they need and where, taking into account the occupation, foot structure and surface and usage,? a spokesperson explains.

 The scanning device consists of a pressure-sensitive plate. The process begins with the customer running across the carpet pad, which contains around 4,000 pressure-sensitive cells. When the foot moves on the pad, these cells measure the position and amount of pressure generated, which is fed into a computer ? a dynamic measurement, taken at 400 frames per second.

 The computer then tenders an automated analysis indicating the support and cushioning needs of the runner.

 Based on this computer analysis, along with the physical examination of the feet, the Footscan experts recommend the right footwear to the customer.

 ?Our focus is innovation and technology with the goal of enhancing sports performance. By bringing the Footscan programme to key cities like Calcutta, we aim to give every customer the opportunity to experience this revolutionary technology first-hand,? says Andreas Gellner, MD, Adidas India Pvt Ltd.

 Medical experts feel the foot-scan programme can make a qualitative difference in pain management as well. 

 ?Almost 90 per cent of all foot pain and 50-60 per cent of all undiagnosed back and knee pain comes from wrong choice of footwear,? observes Vikas Kapoor, orthopaedic surgeon at the Armenian Church Trauma Centre.

 The sports injury specialist feels ?proper footwear with good distribution? can prevent injuries and even help in management of conditions like diabetes-related foot ulcers. 

 ?This scanning system can contribute towards achieving that,? he adds.

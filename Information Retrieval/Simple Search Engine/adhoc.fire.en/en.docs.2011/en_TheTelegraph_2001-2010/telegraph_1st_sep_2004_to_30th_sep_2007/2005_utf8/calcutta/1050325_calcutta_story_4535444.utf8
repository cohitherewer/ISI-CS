 The army has forced the closure of the 169-year-old Eden Gardens, adjoining the stadium, by instructing the forest department to ?indefinitely? seal its gates from Tuesday.

 Neither morning walkers nor day visitors are being allowed into the green zone, on which the army lays claim. The army has taken exception to the government?s recent decision to charge entry fees.

 The entry fee, levied last November, was Rs 2.

 ?We are examining whether the concept of entry fee should be done away with at the garden,? Major-General Z.U. Shah, GOC (Bengal area) told Metro on Thursday.

 Shah said he had taken the decision after receiving complaints from various quarters that ?the park was becoming too elitist?.

 On Monday, senior army officials from Fort William raided the idyllic 15-acre park and pulled down a snacks counter erected inside the garden since the February flower show.

 They then ordered the forest department employees overseeing the Eden Gardens to close the gates till further instructions.

 On Tuesday, the ticket counters at the two entry points to the gardens lay abandoned and the main entrance near Babughat was locked.

 Rakesh Sinha, principal conservator, social forestry, said he was ?very surprised? by the army?s sudden move.

 ?The army shouldn?t have done this. We levied an entry fee of Rs 2 only after the army gave us a written clearance,? said Sinha.

 ?We will discuss the matter on Monday and take it up with the army authorities,? he added. The army had, on August 25, 2004, green-lighted the state government?s move to introduce an entry fee at the Eden Gardens. 

 ?I am very upset at the way the army has shut the park down. Before introducing the entry fee, we had consulted them,? said forest minister Jogesh Barman.

 And how long will access be denied to the garden housing the 151-year-old pagoda? ?The gardens should be thrown open within a month. That is sufficient time for us to decide on the fee issue and also on the maintenance of the gardens along the lines prescribed by the army,? said Major-General Shah.

 Before the army slammed the gates on the greens, the revamped Eden Gardens was drawing close to 1,500 visitors every day.

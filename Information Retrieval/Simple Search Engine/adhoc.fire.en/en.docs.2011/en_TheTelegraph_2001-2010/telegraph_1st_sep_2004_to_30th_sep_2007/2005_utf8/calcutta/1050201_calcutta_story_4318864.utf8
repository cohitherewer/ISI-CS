Radiance rules

Marrying fashion with functionality is 

the mantra when it comes to lighting up the interiors, says Ipsita Deb

The flick of a single switch can transform a room 

from the drab to the dramatic, provided you have the right light fixtures in place. 

Proper illumination can work wonders for your private space and add immense value 

to the most ordinary d?cor. 

Adding fashion to functionality is the mantra in decorative 

lighting of home interiors. But new-age light fixtures do much more than just 

taking care of the fashion factor in the house. From relaxing the eyes to reducing 

fatigue, lights have a major role to play in your overall lifestyle.

Decorative sconces, chandeliers, table and floor lamps 

in a variety of shapes andstyles do much more than just illuminate. 

Trend talk

While traditional, polished brass fixtures still get 

prominence in the decorative lighting scene, a variety of newer options have flooded 

the market. ?Lighting in homes have become more decorative than functional. People 

these days keep changing light fixtures every few years in keeping with the colour 

code and overall look of their house,? says interior designer Meena Bansal.

She adds: ?The d?cor trend in new homes is relaxed, 

spacious interiors with flowing floor plans and minimal furniture. The co-ordinated 

lighting also works towards enhancing the sense of space.? 

Table lamps and floor lamps are still the favourites 

in decorative lighting, explains Bansal. She points out that while earlier metal 

and ceramic used to rule this segment, wood is the new-age material. 

The other hits in this category, apart from the classic 

chandeliers, are accent lamps, floor lamps and sconces. Cast metal bases and glass 

shades in soft tones and floral patterns work well in a variety of settings. Other 

popular materials for shades are silk, mica, linen and brocade. And the patterns 

range from urbane tapestries to exotic animal prints. For more elaborate bases 

for the lamps, brushed nickel and antique brass are good bets.

Room wise

?Indoor lighting can be broadly categorised into halogens 

used on false ceilings, attractive wall sconces and table or floor lamps. These 

can be used individually or in combination depending on the dimensions and requirement 

of a room,? says interior designer Anita Mansatta.

While the dining area demands proper illumination, 

the living room is more conducive to overhead or wall lighting. But interior designer 

Gopa Ray warns against the use of wall lighting as these can cast shadows on the 

floor and thus have a gloomy effect, if not placed strategically. ?Overhead lighting 

from the ceiling and individual lamps all around a room looks very good in the 

living room,? feels Ray. For those not fond of bright lights, an acrylic diffuser 

placed above the shade can help in deflecting the glare of the light.

Art glow

The right kind of lights used to highlight paintings 

not only enhances their aesthetic appeal, but also goes a long way to increase 

the life span of the pieces. A work of art can be spared premature fading by proper 

usage of light sources, filtering and fixture placement. 

?When displaying a painting, always make sure that 

the light is not focussed directly on it as this tends to fade it faster than 

it would have normally,? says Ray.

One way to ensure right display of art is to use picture 

lights ? attached either to the frame or to the wall just above or below. Another 

flexible option is track lighting, which allows one to combine different kinds 

of fixtures for different effects, from spot lighting to wall washing. Once the 

track is installed on the ceiling above the paintings, individual fixtures can 

be placed wherever necessary. Wall washing can be particularly effective while 

highlighting a collection of paintings mounted on a wall. 

The other very popular technique for showcasing art 

is the use of concealed lighting through recessed fixtures that blend into the 

architecture.

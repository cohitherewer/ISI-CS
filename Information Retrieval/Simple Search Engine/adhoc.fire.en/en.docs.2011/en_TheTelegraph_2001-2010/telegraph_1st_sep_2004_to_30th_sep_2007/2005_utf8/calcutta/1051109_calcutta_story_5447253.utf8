 At a style stop

 Panghat, Suruchi, Vibhavari? It has been a sister concern to some of the more popular garment shops down Park Street for some time now. Now, the latest from the house of Saharsh Fashions is Simaaya, an exclusive womens wear store providing dress-up solutions for all ages.

 Housed at 10/4D Elgin Road, this swank 4,000-sq ft store opened its doors last month. The name is a fusion of two words, simply and maya.

 Be it the saris, salwar suits or bags, we stand out because of style, selection and, of course, the competitive price range, says Mayank Agarwal of Simaaya.

 Tradition ties

 Benarasis, Kanjeevarams, Balucharis, Ghatcholas, Bomkais, Bandhej, Kashmiri silks with Pashmina work?The traditional sari section at Simaaya is a treasure trove of regional specialities. The idea is to give variety and authenticity to our customers, explains Mayank. Though nature and traditional motifs are obvious inspirations, a lot of modern innovation is also visible. Prices start at Rs 1,300 and go into lakhs.

 Wed wear

 Bridal drapes in vibrant hues are not restricted to heavy fabrics. Apart from heavily-embellished Benarasis and Kanjeevarams, embroidered crepes and georgettes adorn the racks in this section. These days, people prefer lighter fabrics even for wedding wear. Also, when you buy a set of seven or eight saris for the bride its not only for those big days, but also keeping in mind a variety of occasions she has to attend, says Mayank. Price tags here read Rs 20,000-plus.

 Luxury labels

 Apart from in-house creations, the store houses signature saris from fashion hotshots like Rohit Bal, Priyadarshini Rao, Krishna Mehta, Sayon Mitra, Priti Jhawar and Satya Paul. Imported French chiffons from Italy catch the eye, too. While pretty floral patterns adorn some of the drapes in solid blues and black, French and Chinese calligraphy are imprinted on others. There is also a limited assortment of digitally-printed drapes where geometric patterns are combined with traditional motifs on the borders to produce a stunning effect. Hand-painted crepes and georgettes studded with Swarovski crystals steal the show.

 Suit cuts

 Smart cuts with simple necklines decorated with intricate embroidery, heavy necklines with ornate work all over, collared ones in sober shades?The salwar suit section offers an inexhaustible variety in cotton, silk, crepes, georgettes and jute. These can be picked up readymade or in the form of unstitched material. Prices start from Rs 500.

 Fusion fare

 Though the thrust is on saris and suits, the store also houses a select range of kurtis, tops and skirts. The tops include full-sleeved ones in rich textures with intricate detailing at the collars, half-sleeved ones with ethnic touches and trendy sleeveless ones. Straight skirts as well as flowing and layered ones are eye-catchers. They are available in combinations of whites, mauves and earthy shades. The tops start at Rs 1,000.

 Bag buys

 The bags sourced from Cheemo, a Mumbai-based brand, make for suitable pack-ins for parties and evenings out. Pretty asymmetrical handbags are embellished with sequins and beads. Those with leather finish are decorated with floral embroidery and beads. Prices start at Rs 1,000.

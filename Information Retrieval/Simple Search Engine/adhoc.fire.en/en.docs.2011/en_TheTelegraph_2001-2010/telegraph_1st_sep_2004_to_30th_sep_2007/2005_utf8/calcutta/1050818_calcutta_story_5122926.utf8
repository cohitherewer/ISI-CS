 Sitting at home and savouring homemade Italian cuisine was never so easy. La Cuccina at Hyatt Regency played host to an Italian cookery workshop by executive chef Davide Cananzi on August 10.

 The dishes are mostly from Tuscany. It is heartening to see that Calcuttans today are ready to experiment with cuisines from other countries, too. But the items have been chosen keeping in mind the Indian taste, explains Davide.

 The demonstration covered delicacies like Asparagus Salad with Melted Cheese (asparagus, bocconcini peppered with Tuscan dressing of tomato, black olive, parsley, lemon juice and olive oil), Vegetable Lasagna (layers of pasta in a mixture of zucchini, asparagus, blanched spinach, mushroom, eggplant with toppings of tomato sauce, white sauce and Parmesan cheese), Risotto Milanese with Saffron and Mushrooms (pre-cooked risotto cooked in saut?ed mushroom, vegetable stock, saffron soaked in water, white wine, parsley and served hot with Parmesan), and Lemon and Mascarpone Mousse (mascarpone, lemon, grated lemon zest, sugar, whipped cream with toppings of grated lemon rind and nougat, served chilled).

 It was great fun being here. Back home I am sure to surprise my family with these delicacies, smiled a participant from the interactive workshop.

 Sweet bites

 Sweets and Indian festivals are the perfect pair. Since Raksha Bandhan is round the corner, Sweet World at Alipore and City Centre has come up with a colourful range of candies. The emphasis is on presentation and hygiene, so kids can have a field Friday without parents troubled about tummy aches.

 The festivities were kickstarted on Tuesday with a bunch of lively little ones from Kids Konclave. They were given sweets and candies and encouraged to tie rakhis on whoever they wished.

 Available in a variety of colours and flavours to suit every palate, you can choose from tangy to sour, chocolate-covered to liquorice and, of course, marshmellows. Be it jellybeans, gummy bears or gumballs, theres lots to please the sweet tooth. They come in interesting shapes and sizes ? ugly Martians, vicious vipers, crocodiles, fish, spiders, dolls... And whats more, with every purchase you can stock up on interesting rakhis, too.

 Candies are for kids aged 0 to 100. At Sweet World, one can choose from a range of gourmet sweets and candies to tickle ones tastebuds. Let the child in you take over, shamelessly, advises proprietor Vrinda Rajgarhia.

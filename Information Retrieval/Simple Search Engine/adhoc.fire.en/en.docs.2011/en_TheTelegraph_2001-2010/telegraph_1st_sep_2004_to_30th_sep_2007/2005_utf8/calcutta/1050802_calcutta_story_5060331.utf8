The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 New car with old engine

 - Number mismatch; consumer court moved for damages

 SANJAY MANDAL

 An executive of a multinational company has approached the consumer court after having found that the engine number in the registration certificate of his new car does not match the one on the engine template.

 Arun Ghosh has moved the Calcutta District Forum, seeking compensation of Rs 2 lakh and the cost of the suit on the grounds that the manufacturer and the dealer had fitted an old engine in his new Tata Sumo.

 He has also pleaded for an order asking the manufacturer to replace the vehicle.

 ?The engine is consuming more fuel than what a new engine does and the car has become a financial drag on me,? Ghosh said. 

 The respondents of his petition are Tata Motors (the vehicle manufacturer), K.B. Motors Pvt. Ltd. (the authorised dealer that sold the vehicle) and the motor vehicles authorities.

 After buying the car, Ghosh had approached the motor vehicles authorities for registering it in his name. The certificate arrived a few months later, but Ghosh was shocked to find out that the engine number on the document was different from the one on the template. 

 The number on the template was 483 DL 47 AXY 01842, while that on the certificate was 483 DL 51 AXZ 701842. 

 ?I had purchased the vehicle in good faith, but it seems I have been cheated,? Ghosh said. ?If the car meets with an accident, I will not be able to claim insurance money. I have filed the case to ensure that such things do not happen to others,? Ghosh explained.

 He has alleged in the petition that the dealer had ignored his complaint about the discrepancy in the engine numbers.

 A Tata Motors representative has written to Ghosh: ?If the case is bona fide and the grievances are genuine, we assure you they will be resolved.?

 Contacted by Metro, a K.B. Motors spokesman on Monday denied the allegation that the car had been fitted with an old engine. ?The car was in fine condition when delivered. It had no problem? The case is being heard and at this moment, we can only say that if it is proved that it was an error, we will do whatever is required to change the engine plate number.?

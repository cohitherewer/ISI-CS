 Potholed path to Puja

 - ASIM RULES OUT FUNDS FOR TRACK REPAIRS

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta?s path to Puja 2005 will be a potholed one. Finance minister Asim Dasgupta on Thursday ruled out any road repair projects, pre-Puja.

 ?The government cannot undertake any new project in this regard before Durga puja. Neither can we provide any funds before that. I hope the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, The Calcutta Police traffic wing and the state transport department will take some temporary measures,? said Dasgupta.

 Once the festival season is over, four stretches will be concretised and tram tracks running through them re-laid. Work is likely to start this winter and will definitely be wrapped up in the current fiscal, assured the finance minister.

 On the Puja waiting list for repairs are MG Road, Lenin Sarani, Bowbazar Street and the stretch between Bidhan Sarani (Cornwallis Street) and the Shyambazar crossing.

 Concretising the 23-km stretch will require around Rs 42 crore. ?Half the expenses will be borne by the transport department with HRBC toll funds, while the finance department will shell out the other half,? said Dasgupta. 

 He pointed out that the government had earlier repaired 30 km of tram tracks at a cost of Rs 58 crore.

 What he chose not to mention was that around Rs 30 crore had come from the leftover funds of the Japan Bank for International Cooperation-funded Calcutta Transport Infrastructure Development Project.

 Dasgupta had been forced to loosen his purse strings some three months ago when Calcutta High Court hauled up the government for the appalling condition of city roads, especially the crater-ridden stretches with tram tracks.

 A committee appointed by the government had inspected city roads and drawn up a list of the 10 most ravaged ones. The government had then sanctioned Rs 5 crore for temporary repair work along these stretches.

 The Calcutta Tramways Company (CTC) is engaged in patchwork repair of potholed tram-track stretches over seven km with these funds. 

 These include portions of BB Ganguly Street, Elliot Road, Bidhan Sarani, Rabindra Sarani, Amherst Street, Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road, the stretch between Rajabazar and the Sealdah flyover, and from Harish Mukherjee Road to Kalighat fire station.

 ?But these are temporary measures and will, at best, make driving a bit easier,? said CTC managing director Shankar Pal. ?The main work will be carried out after Durga puja.?

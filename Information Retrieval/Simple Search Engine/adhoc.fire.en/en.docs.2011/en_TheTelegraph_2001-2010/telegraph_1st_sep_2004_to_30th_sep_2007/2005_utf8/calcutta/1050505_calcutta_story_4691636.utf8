 Colour me gold

IPSITA DEB 

The 

richness of colour is the inspiration for Tanishq?s latest collection, Colors. 

The pure gold jewellery range is offset with coloured stones and kundan 

work.

 Unveiled by actress Rituparna Sengupta at the Gariahat 

showroom on Wednesday, the collection was described as a combination of designs 

? ?a blend of the many moods and emotions of life?.

The designs are mostly traditional with a contemporary 

twist achieved with enamel detailing and splashes of intricate work and colourful 

stones. ?A woman has her own preferred colours and uses that to her advantage. 

For example, she might use pearls to convey class and sophistication or pinks 

to subtly highlight playfulness or reds to denote victory,? said Harman Dhillon, 

brand manager of Tanishq. 

 The jewels are priced between Rs 15,000 and Rs 2,00,000.

 Lounge leg

 Red Kitchen and Lounge housed in Enclave in New Alipore is fast becoming a hot night haunt for the city?s party people looking for a chilled-out place to relax. The posh lounge was a hub of activity last weekend as models Naseem Sheikh and Sonali Nagrani took it upon themselves to push the tempo of the lounge bar when they hit the dance floor.

 Targeting the microphone in the DJ console from where they screamed out the usual lines of ?Are you having fun??, the duo soon ensured that even those who had come for a quiet evening were dragged on to the floor, by sheer vocal power. The Sananda Tilottama winners also dropped by.

 Dancing to retro and remixes churned out by resident DJ Anil, the party continued late into the night much like it had when model Anchal Kumar had dropped in with a similar agenda a few months ago. 

 While the adjoining dining area was thronged for its yummy Chinese spread, those on a liquid diet indulged in some Mongolian grub and yummy Indian kebabs that have been added to the lounge menu recently.

 Cotton count

 Keeping comfort as priority number one, Gallery Kanishka?s is organising Suti, an exclusive exhibition of crisp cotton saris created from the handlooms of rural India. 

 Combined with woven patterns, the saris come in a variety of summery colours, ranging from pastels to bright shades. The collection boasts a wide range of styles and motifs as well, from temple-border Chettinads and white-and-gold Kerala cottons to off-white Venkatgiris, cotton and silk Upads and Dhakais. Cotton-based Kancheepurams, Mangalgiris, Pattis, Chanderis, Gadwals and Bengal cotton are also on display. The Maheshwari saris have tussar woven into them to break the monotony of the base.

 Available in stripes, checks, solids and other combinations with a variety of borders, the saris are worth a look. Worth special mention are special tribal cottons. The exhibition is on till May 7.

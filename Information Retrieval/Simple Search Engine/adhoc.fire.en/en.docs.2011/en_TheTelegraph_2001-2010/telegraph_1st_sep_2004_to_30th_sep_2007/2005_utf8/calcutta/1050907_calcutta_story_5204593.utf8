 What began as a buoyant dream six years ago, is today the most-awaited wedding extravaganza of the country. And it is, in founder Diivyaa Gurwaaras words, all about celebrating I do in style.

 Bridal Asia, the annual showing of wedding finery from all over the country and even beyond the borders, is back once again, this time with more opulence than ever before.

 To be held between October 4 and 10 in New Delhi, the event holds up a mirror to trousseau trends for the coming months.

 Bridal Asia 2005 brings together 85 designers ? of wedding ensembles, accessories, jewellery, lingerie, footwear and much more ? under one roof.

 Bridal Asia is growing with every passing year and the number of participants is ever increasing, enabling us to showcase greater variety. And the list of participants from Calcutta, which has always had a strong presence at the event, is also growing every year, says Diivyaa, in Calcutta on Tuesday to promote the event. 

 The Calcutta designers have always done very well at Bridal Asia. What works in their favour, apart from their design brilliance, is their competitive price point. Thats where they score over Mumbai and Delhi, she adds.

 This time, the city will be represented by designers Sabyasachi Mukherjee, Kiran Uttam Ghosh, Monapali, Shantanu Goenka, Nisha Beri, Swapan and Seema Suhasaria, Shamlu Dudeja, Meenakshi Dadoo and Suman Nathwani. Jewellery house Nemichand Bamalwa will also have a huge presence in the ornament section.

 While all the designers will showcase their works at the exhibition between October 8 and 10 at Hotel Taj Palace, the ramp shows from October 4 to 6 at The Grand will feature creations of Sabyasachi, Kiran and Shantanu.

 We have worked with most of the Calcutta designers in the past years, but Meenakshi is a new find and Im very pleased with her work, says Diivyaa. The blend of various kinds of treatments in Meenakshis creations is what has impressed Diivyaa.

 Ive always given space to new talent as that helps to bring more and more perspective to the show. This helps us from the sales point of view, too, adds the lady behind the whole affair.

 Diivyaa pins grand hopes on the Calcutta couture brigade. Each of the designers from Calcutta has different sensibilities. Kiran will be launching her couture line at Bridal Asia this year and Sabyasachi Im sure has something totally new up his sleeve. Shamlus contemporary look with the traditional kantha stitch has always been a sell-out and so has Sumans lingerie lines.

 While designers from Calcutta along with stalwarts from Mumbai and Delhi form the India contingent, designers from across the borders include nine participants from Pakistan and one from Bangladesh.

 From last year, we have had a very strong presence from Pakistan. Apart from seven designers and two fabric companies, we have three of their models walking the ramp. We also have Aneela Haque from Dhaka participating for the first time, adds Diivyaa.

 Designers from Pakistan include Shamaeel, Gul Ahmed, Nilofer Shahid, Soniya Battla, Hina Waquar, Saadia Mirza and Zara Shahjahan.

 Couture for the bride and the groom is the mainstay of the event, but pret and diffusion lines find space on the ramp and the racks, too. The idea behind Bridal Asia is to offer all kinds of wedding fineries. So, apart from the bride and grooms ensembles, we showcase stuff for the entire trousseau, says Diivyaa.

 Bridal Asia will also showcase themes and accessories for the ceremony itself ? d?cor items, flowers, table settings and knick-knacks. To provide glimpses of various wedding themes, the entire venue will be done up by a wedding planner from Dubai and the themes will vary on each day of the show. 

 The table settings, the stage, the music and the whole ambience will be based on one definite theme every day, incorporating various wedding styles weddings, she smiles.

 After the Delhi leg, Bridal Asia will travel to Chennai, Pakistan and Bangladesh early next year. 

 We are also contemplating a show in Calcutta like the one we had done here in 2003. That, too, will be sometime in the beginning of 2006, promises Diivyaa.

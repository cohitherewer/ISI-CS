 Schoolgirls go missing

 Lydia (top) and Manjusha: Untraced 

 Two schoolgirls have gone missing since Thursday evening from an army officers? housing estate in Alipore. Police hinted that the girls might have left on their own accord.

 Manjusha, a student of Class IX, and Lydia, of Class VIII, both from Army Public School in Ballygunge, were last seen around 6 pm on Thursday at Turf View, the estate housing army officers, in Alipore. Manjusha was in a black top and green jeans, while Lydia was wearing a red shirt and pink shorts.

 The missing persons? squad of the detective department and the Army Police are trying to trace the duo. 

 The cops claimed that the girls were close friends and had left with extra clothes. Manjusha, they said, had even taken some cash from home, suggesting that it was a pre-planned move.

 ?I found nothing unnatural with her. She returned from school around 2 pm on Thursday, and we had a long chat. She even pestered me about having a boiled egg. The two of us then went in for a nap,? said Manjusha?s mother, Lt-Col Sashikala, a matron at Command Hospital.

 Every other evening, Manjusha would go for tuitions with Lydia and another friend. Her mother would usually see her off. On Thursday, however, Sashikala had left early along with Lydia?s mother, Lt-Col Aley Kutty, to attend a meeting.

 ?Lydia would usually return by 7.30 pm. But when she didn?t arrive even after two hours, we started searching for her. I would scold her on and off about studies, but nothing so severe... We are not bad parents,? cried Aley.

 Sashikala had been recently transferred and was supposed to join duty in Bangalore next month. She was to move out with her daughter in a few days. Lydia?s younger sister had told their mother that she had heard Lydia telling her friends in the school bus on Thursday that it was her last day in class.

 ?We are working on these leads,? said N. Ramesh Babu, deputy commissioner of police (south).

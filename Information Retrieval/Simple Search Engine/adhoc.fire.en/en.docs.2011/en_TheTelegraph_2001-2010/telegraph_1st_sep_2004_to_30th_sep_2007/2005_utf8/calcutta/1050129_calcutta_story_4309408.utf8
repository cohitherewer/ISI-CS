 And now, a race of and for rickshaws. Calcutta?s favourite two-wheeler, albeit in the slowest-moving category, will hit the fast track on Sunday.

 Dot at 2 pm, Ramlila Park, in Entally, will come alive to the novel sight of rickshaw-pullers of the locality and beyond running for far more than their fare. At stake will be medals, other goodies and fame for the fastest feet and their flying machines.

 Though D-Day is drawing near, the men have little time or inclination to practise. ?We do enough running on the streets,? said Mohd. Jamiruddin on Friday afternoon. The resident of a village near Giridih would love to win a blanket or a pair of shoes at the races. Kailash Das, weary and weatherbeaten, does not fancy his chances and is happy to just take part in the event.

 The show is being organised by Serve the Nation, an NGO that has been working with rickshaw-pullers for a year now. Classes are held on Sundays on various issues, from investment tips to the need to buy a blade while going for a shave to avoid HIV infection. ?We have given them a sense of respect. So, when we told them about the race, each of them was touched,? said Reverend Michael Jha.

 The maximum number of participants is 100, with 10 in each race. ?We will divide the participants into age-groups. The distance to be covered will vary accordingly,? explained volunteer Raju Sarkar. So, the 60-65 group will stop at the 25-m mark while the youngest category, under 35, will sprint for 100 m.

 ?We do not want to keep the distances long. That will only leave them breathless and fatigued. The whole point is to make people realise that they are men, not machines. There are mothers who board the seat with their children and order the rickshaw-puller to speed up as they are running late for school. Our request to them is to manage their time better so that the pressure is not on the poor rickshaw-puller,? said Raju.

 The entire association with the NGO had started with Rev. Jha volunteering to pull a rickshaw while the rickshaw-puller sat back. So, the event will roll with a demonstration lap by the organisers, who will be drawing the rickshaws. 

 The organisers are keeping a couple of surprises up their sleeves. One, that all participants get a lungi. Two, a race for the losers, with the slowest runner crowned winner.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Sputter on stardom step

 She was the only Bengali in the top 11 of the Indian Idol contest and she fought till the last round in sound style. Back home after just failing to make it to the top five, Aditi Paul is a mixed bag of emotions.

 ?Don?t congratulate me, I have not been able to make you all proud,? is the first reaction of the girl who moved on to singing after her broken hand cut short her passion for playing the sitar.

 ?I always wanted to perform on stage in front of a whole lot of people,? says Aditi.

 ?So, once friends started praising my singing abilities, I wanted to sing for the nation and not just for myself. Playback singing was my ultimate goal. I was selected for the Sa Re Ga Ma finals but the dates clashed with my B. Ed finals. So, that didn?t happen.?

 But Sony?s Indian Idol changed all that. ?I went to Mumbai for the first time, but when I saw the people, the streets, the buses, I immediately felt at home. Since then, it has been a memorable journey. I couldn?t make it in the piano round but I never felt it was all over. I came back to Calcutta and started my riyaz straightaway. The three judges, Anu Malik, Farah Khan and Sonu Nigam, were like family and they called me back for the wildcard round.?

 Amidst all that jazz, Aditi came down with chicken pox. ?It was a very tough phase as I was in a Mumbai hospital all alone for more than 12 days. Luckily there were no shoots during that period but I missed out being part of the Indian Idol album, composed by Leslie Lewis. I can?t forget the Muslim woman, though, who prayed for me all the time in the hospital.?

 Even amongst the contestants, Aditi feels, there was more of camaraderie than competition.

 ?We all knew why we were there. All of us were very practical. So even though all of us were very good friends, we knew that there could be only one Indian Idol.?

 Aditi doesn?t want to pick her Indian Idol. ?They are all very good. Rahul Vaidya is very versatile. Abhijeet Sawant has this amazing junoon in him. Amit Sana is the most original of the lot. Prajakta has a lovely voice quality. Again, Ravinderji has a God-gifted singing ability.?

 For the girl who believes in the motto ?one end means a new beginning?, the exit from Indian Idol is just a signal for taking the next step.

 ?Yes, I?ll go to Mumbai and try to establish myself as a playback singer. I am not unhappy that I lost out but I agree with Sonuji who said: ?Everyone has to leave but why do the good have to leave early???

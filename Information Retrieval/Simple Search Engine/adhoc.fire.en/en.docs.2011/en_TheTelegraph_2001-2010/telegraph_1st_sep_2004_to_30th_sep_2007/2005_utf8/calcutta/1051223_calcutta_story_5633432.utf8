The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Green law in red tape

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 The much-hyped Tree Felling and Replantation Act has run into rough weather after the government?s rejection of the draft Bill prepared by an inter-departmental committee.

 On a directive from the chief minister, the environment department had drafted a set of rules on tree felling and replantation. Suggestions were taken from a committee headed by environment secretary Asim Barman and officials of the urban development, forest and municipal affairs departments.

 The draft Bill, formally readied by the law department, was to have been placed before the Cabinet last week, before being tabled in the Assembly. According to Writers? Buildings officials, chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb, who is also Cabinet secretary, sent back the draft Bill, saying that it did not reflect the stand of the government. 

 ?Our aim is to stop rampant felling of trees in the city and ensure steady growth in urban forestation. We also want to punish the violators,?? Deb told Metro. ?The Bill must be specific. The responsibilities of the various departments must be clearly assigned,? he stressed. 

 The Bill proposes to make felling of trees a cognisable offence and force promoters of commercial buildings to plant saplings on an area equal to the construction site. The government will decide on the plot for replantation and the types of trees. Agencies that do not take the responsibility will have to bear the cost. 

 The Bill does not say anything about the number of trees that can be felled for the construction of an estate, said officials. It is also not clear who will count the trees felled and ensure their replantation. 

 The punishment for violators, too, has not been fixed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Trendy to be short 

Clock crib in ramp romp

 - Blink-and-you-miss-it fashion shows the rage, but city begs to differ

Sabyasachi Mukherjee: Long and short of it

 Date: February 23. Time: 9.25 pm. Venue: The Oberoi Grand ballroom. Occasion: Seagram?s Blenders Pride Fashion Tour.

 Some of the guests, still trooping in to enjoy a night of fashion, are stopped in their tracks. Those in the ballroom are preparing to leave, perforce. For, the blink-and-you-miss-it show is over, (as the common grumble goes), ?almost before it began?.

 The display of ensembles by designers Malini Ramani and Aparna Chandra took just 25 minutes ? still too long for the international ramp-time norm of 15 to 18 minutes, but far too short for the Calcutta audience.

 Fed on never-ending entertainment galas with models parading up and down the ramp for hours, the ?shorter the smarter? mantra is still something the city fashion watcher refuses to swallow.

 Designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee puts this down to a lack of fashion awareness: ?Calcutta does not have a fashion audience. People here come to watch the models more than the clothes. The shows here are less about trade and more about entertainment. Who fills up the first row also becomes more important than the clothes.?

 The young designer, who plans to put up an ?eight-to-12-minute show? at the India Fashion Week in April, draws on his western experience: ?Internationally, ramp shows are held only during fashion weeks, with the sole purpose of trade. The norm is to showcase 45 to 50 garments in15 minutes. My Milan show lasted only17 minutes.?

 Designer Kiran Uttam Ghosh takes the same track. ?Fashion shows are no longer about leggy models. They are serious displays of clothes, and not entertainment. The fashion industry in India has realised this and shows all over India are becoming crisper. At the India Fashion Week, a show never exceeds 30 minutes.?

 Kiran is clear that the city must grow up or slip up. ?Only an ill-informed audience wouldn?t appreciate this trend. It?s high time the Calcutta audience and show organisers realise it,? she says.

 One technique used by event managers to stretch shows is to punctuate the ramp romp with song-and-dance routines.

 ?I have seen many shows in Calcutta that continue for even an hour, and they include music-and-dance performances between the sequences. This is simply not done. Fashion is a serious affair and it can?t be diluted with other forms of entertainment,? insists Omar Haider, director of Showhouse, which organised the Blenders Pride show.

 The western model suggests that if organisers want to spice up the night with entertainment, recourse is taken to cocktail parties, preceding or following the show.

 But the clock crib is not unique to Calcuttta, confirms Mumbai-based choreographer and fashion event organiser Anu Ahuja.

 ?Though the trend now is towards shorter shows, wrapping up in a maximum of 35 minutes, a few cities (like Calcutta) where fashion shows are still perceived as entertainment want lengthier ones. Even in Dubai, the demand is for shows lasting at least an hour,? she says.

 With the show time ? along with skirt lengths ? shrinking in metros like Delhi and Mumbai, national ramp affairs in Calcutta are beginning to toe the time line (the Satya Paul extravaganza in December lasted just 20 minutes). But local shows still believe the longer the better.

 City-based choreographer and event manager Sanchita Kushary Bose, feels things are finally changing, even in Calcutta, with fashion shows coming of age.

?Fashion is now serious business and ramp shows are 

no longer meant for entertainment. They are trade shows meant for buyers. So, 

if it stretches beyond 30 minutes, the buyer will get bored and stop noticing 

the clothes. The idea behind a successful show is that the audience should leave 

the hall with the feeling of wanting to see some more,? says Bose.

 US aid for urban reforms 

 - Partnership project boost for water and sanitation services

 JAYANTA BASU

 Bengal has been included in a US-supported urban infrastructure project, Financial Institutions Reform and Expansion (FIRE), the third phase of which was inaugurated in the city on Tuesday.

 The project ? launched in 1994, in association with the Union urban development ministry ? is aimed at ?ensuring delivery of water and sanitation services within cities, mobilisation of infrastructure finance, increasing credit-worthiness of the municipalities, catalysing reforms and capacity-building of urban professionals?. 

 Currently, the project is being executed in seven states.

 The third phase was flagged off in the presence of US consul-general George N. Sibley, urban development and municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya and George Deikun, mission director of the implementing agency (United States Agency for International Development).

 Bhattacharya clarified that the project was restricted to providing technical help to the government and various development agencies working in the infrastructure sector. ?No condition has been or will be imposed on us,? he asserted.

 ?The broad goals apart, FIRE will focus on forging a partnership with the government to ensure successful implementation of the solid waste management mission and to strengthen civic capacities in the Siliguri-Jalpaiguri planning area and the Asansol-Durgapur zone,? explained municipal affairs secretary Dipankar Mukhopadhyay.

 ?The project will also help the government in replacing single-entry accounting with a more transparent system and introducing a unit area-based system of property tax valuation,? the minister added. 

 A bill on the proposed tax system, prepared for the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, is lying with a select committee of the Assembly .

 Both Deikun and project coordinator Nabarun Bhattacharya stressed the need for a ?municipal development fund?, which will be a nodal body for handling all municipality-related funds coming from state, national or international sources.

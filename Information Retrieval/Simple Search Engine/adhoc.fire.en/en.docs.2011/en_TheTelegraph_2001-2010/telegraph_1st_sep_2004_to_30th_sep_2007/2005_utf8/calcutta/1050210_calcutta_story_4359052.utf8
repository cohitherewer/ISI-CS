The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 State to toe court road-fix order 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Chief secretary Asok Gupta said on Wednesday that the government would abide by the order of Calcutta High Court on repairing tram tracks. ?I cannot comment until I have seen a copy of the order. However, the government will have to go by it,? Gupta said.

 The high court had on Tuesday directed the government to consider the Calcutta Tramways Company (CTC) plea for repair of the damaged tram tracks. 

 The court ordered that copies of the report ,submitted by a five-member monitoring committee, be sent to finance minister Asim Dasgupta and transport minister Subhas Chakraborty. 

 The court also asked the chief secretary to file a report within 14 days on the government?s decision with regard to the CTC?s demand.

 The order followed a report furnished by the committee of lawyers, set up by the high court to oversee the condition of roads with tram tracks. 

 Last year, the CTC had sent the transport department a proposal asking for Rs 53.55 crore to repair 15 of the stretches of tram tracks in the city in the most deplorable condition. 

 After the department failed to reply to the proposal, a monitoring committee was formed by the court to oversee the progress of road repairs. 

 Transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury said he was yet to see the order, but maintained that his department would initiate necessary action once it receives a copy.

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has refused to repair roads with craters through which tram trucks run as they fall under the CTC?s purview.

 Student suicide

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The decomposed body of Soumyadeep Mitra, 21, a BSc first year student of physiology at City College, was found hanging in his single-room flat in a two-storey building in Raja Lane, under Amherst Street police station, around midnight on Monday.

 ?The youth had used a length of jute rope to hang himself from the ceiling fan. We suspect that he killed himself about two days ago. There was no suicide note or any sign of foul play,? said Barun Kumar Mullick, deputy commissioner of police (north). 

 Local people had called police as a stench emanated from Soumyadeep?s room around 9.30 pm. Police broke into the room, locked from inside. 

 After both his parents died in quick succession about two years ago, Soumyadeep, an introvert, had moved to Calcutta from Katwa. 

 His elder brother Biswadeep, also a student, lived in an adjacent flat in the same building. Neighbours said he was visiting relatives and was unaware of Soumyadeep?s demise.

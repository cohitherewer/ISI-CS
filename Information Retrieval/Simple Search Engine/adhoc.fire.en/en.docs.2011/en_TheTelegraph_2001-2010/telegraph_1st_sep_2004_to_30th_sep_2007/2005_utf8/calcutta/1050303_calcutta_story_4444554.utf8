The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Revenue up, ditto water profile

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 After a surplus in revenue, a surplus in filtered water. 

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation, during the tenure of mayor Subrata Mukherjee, has been producing 378 million gallons of filtered water a day, against a demand for 337.15 million gallons.

 In 2000, the gap between the daily demand for and the supply of drinking water had been 80 million gallons. Now, the per capita daily supply of filtered water is 234 litres. 

 ?Be it in homes, hospitals, offices, schools or colleges, you need water round-the-clock. The quality of life depends on the supply of healthy and sustainable water. So, I have invested Rs 390 crore in the sector,? mayor Mukherjee said. 

 The civic body, over the past four-and-a-half years, has increased the daily storage capacity by 28 million gallons. Which means, it can supply an additional 80 million gallons of filtered water every day.

 In contrast, the increase in the storage capacity during the 15-year tenure of the Left Front board had been only 22 million gallons. In 2000, when the Trinamul-BJP combine wrested power from the Left Front, the water supply department could store up to 68 million gallons of water. 

 The hike in the storage capacity became possible with the setting up of the 100-million-gallons-a-day- capacity New Palta Waterworks and the augmentation of the capacity of Garden Reach Waterworks. 

 Even the Opposition CPM has conceded the improvement in the water supply situation, though its chief whip in the civic body, Amal Mitra, claimed that the process had been initiated by the previous Left Front board. 

 ?We started the process by setting up a 40-million-gallon water treatment plant in Palta in the late 1990s,? he said. ?We had also commissioned booster stations at Mohammad Ali Park and Park Circus. The construction of booster stations in Bagmari and Ranikuthi started during our time, but could not be completed because of financial constraints.?

 According to mayor Mukherjee, financial constraint is an ?excuse?. He attributed the ?success? of his board to the attitude of his team, which, he boasted, was opposite to that of the Left Front.

 ?When we can harness enough resources to finance utility projects without imposing any extra tax burden on the citizen, why couldn?t they?? he asked.

 Also during his term, the civic body has been earning more revenue than what it pays to its 37,000-strong workforce.

 In the CPM vision, Mukherjee said, Calcutta is a city for the poor. ?So, their development schemes never took into account the citizen?s right to quality service.? 

 In his vision, he added, ?Calcutta has the potential to become one of the best cities in the world?.

Couture contradictions

Kiran?s Call

Designer Kiran Uttam Ghosh tunes 

into the mix-and-match trends dictating fashion in the summer of 2005

Uttam Ghosh, which the designer feels is the hottest ?item number? of the season.

Ten years before its time, a fashion is indecent, 

10 years after, it?s hideous, but a century later it?s romantic. That?s what makes 

forecasting trends a crucial part of the fashion industry. It is something that 

keeps the world of the wearer and the worn from disintegrating into chaos. Otherwise, 

fashion would be only what one wears oneself. And Oscar Wilde would grin and say, 

?I told you so. What is unfashionable is what other people wear.?

Fashion is definitely not changed because it?s a form 

of ugliness so intolerable that we have to turn it over every six months. I?ve 

often wondered why do we want new clothes? Why can?t we be satisfied with what 

we have? Why this preoccupation with the length of a hemline or the shape of a 

heel. Because we are passionate about the way we look. We know that the difference 

between looking good and feeling bad can be resolved by a great shirt or kurta 

or sari. A good outfit can transform.

though I?m not a fan, look at the very basic example 

of Jassi. When I know I?m well dressed it restores to me a sense of who I am. 

My mother taught me my mantra in life ? to respect others, that chicken 

soup can cure almost anything, and the size and shape of your handbag and the 

heel of your shoe make or break a look.

This season, anything goes and the message is in the 

mix. In many ways, it is a season of contradictions. Individualism is the message, 

so break the rules, create your look. On the one hand, pretty floral country prints 

of all shapes and sizes straight out of an English spring garden work well. At 

the same time, ethnic influences like our paisley, the intricate kalamkari 

and almost all other traditional motifs that we grew up with, look fresh. Go global 

and include African tribal beadwork and motifs to add to the colour and texture 

story, giving birth to your ?tribalite? avatar. 

There seems to be an explosion of colours and pattern 

as layer after layer of print begins to look interesting. For ornamentation, handwork 

from my grandmother?s time is back ? a revival of crochet, cut-work, smocking, 

applique and patchwork mixed and matched to make a sensible hotch potch. 

The 70s hippie-style dresses and kurtas in 

sheer fabrics and kaftan-style tops worn over regular blue jeans work well.

Very hippy chic. The gypsy skirt is the season?s hottest item number.

This summer, the look is refreshing, romantic and 

feminine. Old-world delicate net showing below the skirt hems. Or lace petticoats 

peeping from below saris. Reach out for your chiffon and georgette printed saris. 

Somewhere I?m remembering Yash Chopra?s women in soft chiffons, but with lots 

of floral prints, one over the other. 

Try them in interesting colours from pastels to coral 

and flame red offset, perhaps, by brown, intense shades of green from bright jade 

to something that reminds you of lettuce or raw mango, set off with a happy, sunshine 

yellow. Go offbeat with mixes of brights, pales and neutrals. 

My favourite base fabric is the one that?s happiest 

for summer: linen. In all weights, shapes and sizes, the magic and chic of linen 

in its new developments is unbelievable, especially in its natural shades. 

I believe trends, like horses, are easier to ride 

in the direction they are already going! Following trend predictions seems to 

be the simplest thing to do. People have asked me if there are serious studies 

behind predictions, then what does the designer take credit for? Why compliment 

the drop-dead gorgeous wearer? Because, as in war so in fashion, you always know 

the right thing to do. The hard part is doing it.

 Frozen emotions

 Featuring 17 sculptures in bronze, wood and mixed media, Bhaskarjya, the ongoing solo exhibition of Prabirkumar Roys work, comprises frozen frames of lifes myriad moods. They capture the entire gamut of human emotions with a solemn sensitivity and maturity that ascribes to his forms a natural grace and dignity. Reflecting themes from life and nature, with an emphasis on human relationships and mans archetypal need to connect with the natural world, the sculptures on show provide an insight into Roys concern for a stable and harmonious social and natural universe. In his hands, bronze melts to emerge with the tenderness of clay, to tell a story in his own, inimitable way. Ganapati I (wood and bronze) and Musician II (bronze) illustrate the amazing ease with which he plays around with forms to lend his creations a lyrical touch.

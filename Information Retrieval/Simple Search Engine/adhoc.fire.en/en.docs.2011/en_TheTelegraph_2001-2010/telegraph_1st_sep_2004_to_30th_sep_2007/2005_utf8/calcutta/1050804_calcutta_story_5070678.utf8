 Court rap for locker break 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court on Wednesday asked the authorities of the international branch of Allahabad Bank, on Park Street, to shift the contents of a locker to a locker in another branch of the bank. 

 The authorities were also asked to provide a list of the items in the locker to the woman who had rented it.

 Justice Jayanta Biswas passed the order on a petition by Sharmishtha Biswas, a resident of Salt Lake, alleging that the bank authorities had broken open her locker and taken away the valuables in it for alleged default in payment of rent over the past two years.

 Appearing for Sharmishtha, Balai Ray, advocate-general of the state, and Debasish Kar Gupta, additional government pleader, told the court that their client had given a standing order to the bank to deduct the locker rent from her account.

 It was the first time that Ray appeared as counsel for a private client, after becoming the state advocate-general.

 ?Sharmishtha had an account in the same bank and a sum of money was deposited there. But the bank authorities did not bother to deduct the rent from the account. Moreover, they did not inform Sharmishtha before breaking open her locker,? the lawyers alleged.

 The lawyers also claimed that the authorities declined to hand over to Sharmishtha the items found in her locker.

 ?Some ornaments were stored in the locker. They were required for a marriage. When Sharmishtha went to bank to get the ornaments, she found the locker had been accessed,? Ray explained.

 Appearing for the bank, advocate Gopal Mukherjee told the court that Sharmishtha was one of the owners of a company that had borrowed Rs 8 crore from the bank. He argued: ?Now the company is in liquidation. So, the bank authorities had broke open her locker.?

 Justice Biswas expressed surprise at the step taken by the bank authorities. ?Lockers are private properties of the customers. How can a bank open a locker without informing the person it belongs to??

 The judge also asked advocate Mukherjee whether his client had obtained permission from any court before accessing the locker.

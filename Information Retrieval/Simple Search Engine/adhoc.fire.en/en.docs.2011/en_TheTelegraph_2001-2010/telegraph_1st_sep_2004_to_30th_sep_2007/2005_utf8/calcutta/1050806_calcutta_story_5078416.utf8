 Importer cloak for smuggler

 - Grey market supplier arrested on way to airport

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Acting on a communique from the Union finance ministry, the city police arrested alleged smuggler Vinod Galodia in his Hazra Road flat on Thursday, minutes before he was scheduled to leave for the airport. 

 According to police sources, Galodia, in his mid-50s, is one the biggest suppliers of electronic gadgets in the grey market across the country.

 After a preliminary investigation, officers have come to know that Galodia used to smuggle in electronic goods for the past several years under the garb of his import business.

 In the papers submitted to the authorities, he has mentioned that he owns an electronic gadget-manufacturing unit in Varanasi. On inquiry, police learnt that the unit does not exist.

 ?Besides, he was supposed to import electronic parts only. Instead, he imported gadgets like photocopy machines and sold them in the grey market,? an officer said.

 Galodia?s arrest followed a letter from the joint secretary in the Union finance ministry?s revenue department to police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee, requesting him to detain the person.

 Mukherjee forwarded the case to detective department deputy commissioner (I) Gyanwant Singh, who pressed the anti-rowdy squad into action. 

 ?Initially, we faced a lot of problem, as we had no idea what Galodia looked like,? said an officer of the detective department. 

 ?We planted our sources in and around the locality where he lived. Our plan was to raid the home only after being absolutely certain that he was inside. Or else, we might have ended up warning him off our trail,? the officer added.

 The sleuths had to wait a couple of weeks. ?On Thursday afternoon, we were tipped off that Galodia had entered his apartment, on the top floor of the four-storeyed Hazra Road building,? disclosed the officer.

 A team immediately left the Lalbazar police headquarters and reached the spot in 45 minutes.

 ?Our men split into two groups. One group took the lift and the other walked up the staircase. But reaching the flat, the cops met with Galodia?s personal guards who did not let them enter,? said another officer.

 Police had no option but to break the lock. ?Galodia was packing his luggage and getting ready to leave the city. We found an air ticket in his possession,? the officer added.

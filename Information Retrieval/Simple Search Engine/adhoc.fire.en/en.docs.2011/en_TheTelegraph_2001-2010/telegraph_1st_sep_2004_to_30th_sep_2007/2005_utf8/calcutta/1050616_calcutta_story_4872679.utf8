 Bail plea by goon rejected

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court on Wednesday rejected the bail petition of Dilip Banerjee, better known as Hatkata Dilip.

 Dilip was arrested late last year, following a shoot-out at a musical soiree at Nayapatti, off Salt Lake, on August 29 last year. Dilip, the prime accused in the case, had given the police the slip.

 During a raid, police landed up at a Salt Lake hotel owned by former international athlete Avtaar Singh. Singh was not there, but police chanced upon a ?sex racket? and Singh was put behind bars.

 Later, two East Bengal Football Club frontline players were arrested on charges of their ?association? with Dilip. The duo spent a week in jail, before being released. Dilip, too, was picked up from his hideout and arrested.

 On Wednesday, Justice Amit Talukdar and Justice S.P. Mitra of Calcutta High Court rejected the bail prayer of Hatkata Dilip. Moving the bail plea, Joymalya Bagchi told the court that there was no direct evidence of his client being involved in crime. Opposing the bail plea, state counsel Pinaki Bhattacharya claimed that the police had reached a crucial stage of the investigation, and grilling Dilip was imperative. 

 It is alleged that Dilip, who was present at Nayapatti, was instrumental in starting the brawl over a dance performed by ?Miss Laila?. A man was killed in the shoot-out.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 We Ask You Answer

 Bolt the doors, scan visitors

 Each week, Metro asks its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses is published every Wednesday. Today?s question: Can law and order problems on the campus be solved by banning entry of outsiders to colleges?

Sukanta Pachal, 

 Howrah

 Banning the entry of outsiders into campuses is undoubtedly a way to solve the law and order problems in colleges and universities. In some institutions, hoodlums roam imperiously on campus, spoiling the ambience. The time has come to keep these people out. Security should be beefed up to deny entry to unwanted elements. People with genuine needs, however, should not have to suffer. Insiders must also play a vital role in maintaining order on college campuses.

 Atif Ayaz, 

 Library Lane

 Unless the law and order situation on campus is under control, an academic institution cannot improve. Entry of outsiders into college premises is illegal and results in nothing but nuisance. It is the responsibility of both the students and the authorities to maintain a proper environment on campus.

 PrasIt Sen, 

 Hatiara

 A ban on the entry of outsiders into educational institutions will lead to several problems. There are many guardians and students who visit colleges and universities to make inquiries. They will face difficulties if there is a proscription on outsiders. Checking of identity cards would be a more effective step. 

 Ronita Dutta, 

 Jadavpur

 It is unfortunate that there are law and order problems on campuses. But then, what?s happening in college premises is a reflection of the lawlessness outside. The authorities must take steps immediately to redress the problem. The purpose of visit of an outsider must be determined before he or she is allowed in.

 Bhupen Bose,

 Dum Dum 

 In several cases, law and order on college campus suffers due to union rivalry or ragging. At times, long-standing disputes between the students and the administration result in unpleasantness. Preventing outsiders from accessing the campus can help the law and order situation from spiralling out of control. College authorities must take a rigid stand in this regard. 

Ranadip Das, 

 Address not given

 Banning the entry of outsiders into colleges will not help in putting a lid on the law and order problems on campuses. However, the general academic environment will certainly improve if such a step is taken. I feel that the authorities should first try to control indiscipline by students before barring outsiders from campuses.

 Sneha Rai Chowdhury,

 College Street

 The public and students of other colleges have every right to enter a college if they need to. An arbitrary ban on the entry of outsiders cannot be imposed.

Subho Bhattacharya,

 Deb Lane

 No one can say with certainty that a ban on the entry of outsiders to colleges would solve the law and order problems on campuses. But it is necessary for the colleges, especially evening colleges, to bolster security. However, it must be kept in mind that no college in the city would be able to arrange the kind of security in place in corporate offices. The insiders also have a big hand in the creation of some types of problems. For example, it is generally the students who invite friends from other colleges to their campuses. Reasonable restrictions on the behaviour of the students would go a long way in improving the law and order situation on campuses.

Satyanarayan Das,

 Metiabruz

 Outsiders must be prohibited from entering educational institutions. Those who try to enter colleges and universities without a reason should be punished. The guardians of students and staff members need to be provided identity cards before steps can be taken against the outsiders.

Samyak Nandy,

 Bangur

 I think there are deep-rooted causes behind lawlessness on campuses across the country. A bar on the entry of outsiders cannot be the answer to the problem. Moreover, there is no way such a ban can be implemented in medical colleges. Strict vigil on the campus could be one of the alternatives. 

dipro ray,

 Beniapukur Lane

 Completely banning the entry of outsiders into colleges is impossible and it would be a pity if the authorities fail to grasp the fact. Outsiders are bound to visit colleges and universities to inquire about admission criteria. The authorities have no right to debar these people from campus, especially at the time of admission. It would also not be possible to differentiate between someone visiting a college for a genuine reason and an intruder. Police patrol might be more effective. Safety measures ought to be enhanced in evening colleges.

 Neepa Mitra,

 Salt Lake 

 The entry of outsiders to colleges and universities should be restricted. Colleges are meant for academic pursuits and no one except staff and students need to be present on the campuses. Recent incidents in city colleges have highlighted the problems that outsiders pose on campus.

Sourabh dhanuka, 

 Salt Lake

 I don?t think a ban on the entry of outsiders can solve law and order problems on campuses. The students are quite often responsible for fracas within colleges. They should not forget that they are as responsible for the security in a college as the authorities and the staff. The government needs to ensure that proper safety measures are adopted on campuses.

 Indranil Sanyal,

 Dhakuria

 Law and order problems on campus can be minimised by banning the entry of outsiders. Maintaining proper atmosphere inside educational institutions is of utmost importance. The careers of future generations depend on it. The shameful recent incidents in a couple of city colleges should act as eye-openers. Guards would not able to prevent untoward incidents on campuses unless the gates are properly manned. 

 Rahul Roy Chowdhury,

 Dum Dum

 All outsiders do not enter the premises of educational institutions with the intention of disturbing students. Incidents of eve-teasing and ragging are often perpetrated by the students themselves. A ban on the entry of outsiders will take the fun out of college life. 

 Neha Dokania,

 Bangur Avenue

 Banning the entry of outsiders into colleges is the most important step that can be taken to tighten security on campuses. It will make the students feel more secure. Like schools and offices, there should be a security blanket around colleges.

 Ali Ahmed Khan,

 Bhowanipore

 Colleges cannot be made secure unless their doors are closed to outsiders. Many colleges in south Calcutta are frequented by goons, who were never connected with academics in any way. These people need to be thrown out to ensure the safety of students.

 Ujjal Bhattacharyya,

 Entally

 A rigid ban on the entry of outsiders to colleges would be unfair for a lot of people. But deterioration of the law and order situation might necessitate adoption of such a move. Security personnel need to be specially trained to work in academic institutions. A high-handed approach by them will lead to further problems. The authorities should arrange funds for the project. The activities of students also need to be monitored. 

 Priyanka Saha,

 Birati

 College authorities must ban the entry of outsiders into the premises. The students, on the other hand, need to be trained in self-defence.

gunjeet wadhwa,

 Rai Bahadur Road

 Law and order problems on campuses can be solved to a great extent by banning the entry of outsiders. A check on the insiders is also in order.

 Sashikanta Saha,

 Barasat

 Apart from banning the entry of outsiders into colleges, the authorities need to ensure that the students are disciplined, vigilant and alert. Along with the authorities, they need to maintain such an atmosphere on campus that the outsiders dare not create a problem.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Action fast but flawed

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The operation was smooth and scary. The abductors of Roma Jhawar were armed, they effectively blocked the car she was travelling in, they dragged her out at gunpoint, ordered the others out of the car and whisked away the victim ? all within minutes.

 But given the initial ransom demand ? Rs 50 lakh ? police are wondering whether the kidnappers had really targeted Satya Narayan Jhawar?s daughter Roma or whether it was a case of mistaken identity.

 ?We are probing whether the kidnappers had planned to abduct someone else from a bigger business family bearing the same name,? said North 24-Parganas superintendent of police Parveen Kumar.

 The Jhawars came from Rajasthan four decades ago and settled down in Calcutta. They started a business in dyeing clothes and set up a unit on Foreshore Road, in Howrah. The operations were hardly huge, with the unit employing about 25 people, family sources said. The Jhawars had moved into their Salt Lake home, from a rented place, a few years ago.

 ?It is unrealistic to make such a massive ransom demand from this family,? said Harman Preet Singh, deputy inspector-general (Presidency range). ?The abductors have, of course, scaled down the demand to Rs 5 lakh, but a number of pieces in this jigsaw just don?t fit,? he added.

 The dramatic scaling down of the ransom demand has also led police to believe that the kidnappers were not hardened criminals.

 Another question asked is why the kidnappers, if they were out to harass the Jhawar family, did not kidnap four-year-old Vedant, son of Satya Narayan?s son Rajesh.

 Police have also not ruled out the possibility of the abductors targeting the Jhawars of CB block, Salt Lake, but getting their financial worth wrong.

 CII adds clout to fair complex

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The proposed trade fair complex on EM Bypass got a fresh lease of life on Wednesday with the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) expressing willingness to raise money for the project and join hands with the state government in completing it.

 Chairman of CII (eastern region) Ravi Poddar met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Wednesday and expressed his organisation?s willingness to participate in the project.

 ?We are prepared to develop the complex even as a majority shareholder,? asserted Poddar.

 The state has been scouting for a partner in the Rs 50-crore project, after Indian Trade Promotion Organisation (ITPO) withdrew from the joint venture a few months ago. The chief minister has reportedly sought CII?s support in the project.

 The state and Calcutta Municipal Corporation each have a 24.5 per cent stake in the West Bengal Trade Promotion Organisation, the joint venture company formed to develop and run the fair ground.

 ITPO, which earlier had a 51 per cent stake, will contribute to the project by bringing fairs to the ground. 

 ?The 18-acre land on EM Bypass has been developed. We will now invite technical and financial bids from those short-listed after evaluation of the expressions of interest,? commerce and industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen said on Wednesday. 

 ?We are trying our best to ready the complex for outdoor fairs by October, when the fair season starts. However, it will take at least another year for the facilities to be in place for indoor fairs,? Sen added.

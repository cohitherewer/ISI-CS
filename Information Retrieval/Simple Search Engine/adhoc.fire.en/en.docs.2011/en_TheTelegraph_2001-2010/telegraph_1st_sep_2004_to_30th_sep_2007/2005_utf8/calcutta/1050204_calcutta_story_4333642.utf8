 Fire guts slum huts

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A fire, originating from a locked room, razed three huts and two shops in the slums in Kalitara Basu Lane, off Beleghata Main Road, near Sarkar Bazar, on Thursday afternoon.

 Eight fire-tenders took about half-an-hour to control the blaze. The cause of the fire could not be ascertained. 

 ?The fire had started a long time before we were called, so the damage had been done by the time we reached the spot,? said divisional fire officer Bibhash Guha.

 ?We are not ruling out foul play. A forensic investigation will be initiated and, if necessary, we will lodge a complaint with the police,? he added.

 ?There were a number of inflammable articles strewn around the spot, which caused the fire to spread rapidly. Dwellers of the slum had already started splashing buckets of water from the rooftops of the adjacent buildings,? a fire-fighter said.

 Mintu Das, a resident of the area, said that a four-member family occupied the room from where the fire had started. The husband was out on work, while the wife had gone to fetch the children from school when the fire started.

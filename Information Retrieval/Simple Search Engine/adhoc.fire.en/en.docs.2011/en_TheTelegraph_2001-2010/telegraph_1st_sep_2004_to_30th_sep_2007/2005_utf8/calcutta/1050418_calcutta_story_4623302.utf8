 Charting their own future

 - Urban local bodies told to draw up their ward-based plans

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s government has asked the 40 municipalities under the Calcutta Metropolitan Area (CMA) to prepare their own plan documents. 

 As of now, these municipalities ? in the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) area but excluding Calcutta Municipal Corporation ? do not prepare their individual ward-based detailed plans.

 But henceforth, to make the urban local bodies self-sufficient and to work out their plans in accordance with their needs and visions, the state government has asked all of them ? located around Calcutta ? to frame ?detailed, ward-based plan documents?.

 It will not only help the urban local bodies visualise their future requirements, but also help them identify themselves as part of the larger plan under the CMDA umbrella. 

 The government has prepared a set of ?draft development plan guidelines for the urban local bodies?, which will be handed over to each of these 40 municipalities, from which they can take their cue to prepare their own documents.

 ?The municipalities have been asked to first identify the needs and requirements of basic civic facilities available to its people,?said Asok Bhattacharya, municipal affairs minister. 

 ?The idea is to focus on the gaps in the present facilities and to plan for those that must be made available to them,? he added.

 Some of these urban local bodies are Barrackpore, Kanchrapara, Bhatpara and Titagarh municipalities.

 The 40 municipalities under the CMA fall in the Rs 700-crore Calcutta Urban Services for the Poor project, funded by the British government?s Department for International Development. 

 The urban local bodies will have to involve ward committees to prepare their plan documents. 

 ?For technical assistance and detailing the projects, assistant engineers and planners have already been assigned,? Bhattacharya said. 

 Forty officers of the rank of assistant engineer and 20 planners from the CMDA have been assigned to help the municipalities prepare their plans.

Get set

Make-up artiste Prabir De dolls up actress 

Swastika Mukherjee for an evening do

SMITA ROY CHOWDHURY

The festivities of spring are mostly over, but that 

doesn?t mark the end of your days of decking up. With the wedding season knocking 

on the door, in a couple of weeks you?ll have to pull out the heavy silks and 

shimmering crepes from your wardrobe as you get set to dazzle at evening dos. 

Even if you?re not tying the knot yourself, or don?t have a marriage coming up 

in the family, you are not likely to get through the coming months without attending 

a couple of wedding ceremonies and receptions.

While you might have your kanjeevarams and 

ikkats ready with co-ordinated jewellery, to make a stylish impact it?s 

essential that you get your make-up basics right. And even the most fashionable 

among us will admit that dolling up during the summer months is not a particularly 

easy task. 

Says make-up artiste Prabir De: ?If you are attending 

a wedding or a party, it?s very difficult to keep the make-up intact throughout 

the evening, given the humid weather. However, there are certain dos and don?ts 

one should follow so that the make-up doesn?t start melting as soon as you step 

out of the house.?

De shares a few make-up measures for the summer while 

dolling up actress Swastika Mukherjee for a wedding do.

Beauty basics

To make sure that the make-up doesn?t start melting, 

you have to try to keep your face as sweat-free as possible. A good way of doing 

this, suggests De, is to rub ice on the face for a good 15-20 minutes before you 

start applying the make-up. A thorough ice massage ensures that you sweat less. 

Follow this up with an astringent lotion or a toner, so the facial skin becomes 

firm. 

?In summer, it?s important to keep the skin squeaky 

clean. One should follow a good cleansing-toning regimen and splash lots of water 

on the face from time to time. Also take care not to apply make-up on dirty skin. 

This will not only look bad, it will harm the skin too,? says De.

Base blend

?Liquid foundation should totally be avoided in summer 

as this will start melting as soon as you step out of an air-conditioned environment. 

And after some time the face will look patchy,? explains De. 

He did up the base for Swastika?s make-up with a few 

dots of stick foundation, which is blended well all over the face with a puff. 

This makes the skin look luminous, without causing it to sweat too much.

Eye aura

De co-ordinated Swastika?s make-up with a bright red 

embroidered sari and hence the colours have been restricted to the red family. 

?Eye make-up should be kept light during the summer. If you are wearing ethnic 

clothes, the colours have to be pinkish or mauvish,? says De. 

He applied a blend of pink, mauve and copperish gold 

shadows on Swastika?s upper eyelid and touched it up with light silver shimmer. 

Smudged kajal lines the under eye, blended with shadows of the same shade. 

Eye-liner is not finding much favour this season, but those fond of dark eyes 

could do with a line of smudged kajal on the upper lid as well. Mascara 

for the lashes is essential, but make sure to apply a water-proof one to avoid 

sweat from smudging it.

Chic cheeks

Pink, pink, and more pink is the motto when it comes 

to blush-on. ?Various shades of pink ? peachish pink, mauvish pink and rose pink 

? go very well with ethnic clothes,? adds De. And he used a blend of all three 

colours to do up Swastika?s cheeks, following it up with a highlighter. A little 

bit of copper gold shimmer and a touch of bronzer near the temples, completes 

the story here.

Lip lustre

The colour here depends totally on the outfit you 

are wearing. And however much pastels might be in fashion, a pale pink lipstick 

with a bright red sari is not exactly the perfect combination. De has adorned 

Swastika?s lips with a liberal dash of rose red lip colour, which is in perfect 

sync with the sari she?s wearing. 

?The shades of rose ? be it pink or red ? go well 

with Indian dresses. If you?re heading for a very fancy do, you could touch up 

the lipstick with a coat of gold lip colour. And the lip liner should be blended 

very well so that it doesn?t stand out,? advises De.

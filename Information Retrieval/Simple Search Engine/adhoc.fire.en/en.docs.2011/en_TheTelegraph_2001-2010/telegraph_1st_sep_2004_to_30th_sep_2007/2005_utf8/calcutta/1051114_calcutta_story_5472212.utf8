 CM push for neuro centre

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 The project of the Institute of Neurosciences, the much-awaited, one-stop super-speciality centre for neurology, being planned for the past six months, is set to take off, thanks to the personal initiative of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.

 A first of its kind in the country, the institute will come up on 32 cottahs near Mullickbazar, donated by Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) to US-based neurosurgeon R.P. Sengupta, the brain behind the project. The CMC will function as a partner but not for any financial gain. Construction at the site will begin from Wednesday, the day after chief minister lays the foundation stone.

 ?The super-speciality neuro care and research centre will boast state-of-the-art facilities. From handling outdoor patients to neurosurgery and to rehabilitation and research, all will be available under one roof,?? Sengupta said on Sunday.

 On the cards are a trauma care unit, a stroke unit, a neuro-psychiatry unit, a 150-bed hospital and a rehabilitation centre for post-cerebral attack victims of paralysis. A group of neuroscientists, general physicians and trained paramedical personnel will be entrusted with the day-to-day running of the institute.

 The initial investment, Sengupta said, would be Rs 30 crore. ?We will raise the funds through donations from various sources. Many well-wishers and NRI doctors have already promised to pitch in. However, we will not accept money for commercial benefit, nor will we declare any dividend. It will be a non-commercial and non-profit making organisation,? he added.

 Campaigns in the districts to spread awareness about neurological diseases, hypertension and cerebral attack are also on the to-do list. 

 ?Stroke is the second major cause of death after cardiac arrest. Yet, less attention is paid to stroke or brain attack. The super-speciality centre is essential to cope up with the increasing incidence of neurological problems,?? said former head of neurology department of Calcutta Medical College Dipesh Mondal, who is also associated with the project.

 For better or for worse, a 16-year-old girl married the 20-year-old father of her child on Tuesday.

 Police watched on as Chhotka Das, of Kailash Ghosh Road, in Thakurpukur, wed Tumpa Tanti. The reluctant groom had been arrested for abandoning the girl when he found out she was pregnant.

 Tumpa, a resident of Regent Park, gave birth to a boy on May 5 at MR Bangur Hospital. 

 ?It all started on May 23, when a tearful Tumpa, seven months pregnant, came to me after being dumped by her lover, who refused to marry her even on hearing she was expecting,? said Rumki Chakraborty, a social worker.

 She took Tumpa to the Regent Park police station, where a complaint was lodged against Chhotka. Both Tumpa and Chhotka?s fathers are daily wage-earners.

 On the basis of this complaint, the youth was arrested on May 25. 

 He was produced later in the day at the sub-divisional judicial magistrate?s court, and remanded in jail custody by magistrate Manjit Singh. His prayer at Calcutta High Court was also rejected.

 On Tuesday, the case came up for hearing at the chief judicial magistrate?s court in Alipore, where Chhotka?s lawyer Utpal Chatterjee pleaded for his client?s release, claiming that as the child had been born, Chhotka was ready to marry the girl.

 Additional district judge Abhijit Lala granted bail on condition that Chhotka marry Tumpa within three days and report the matter to court by June 15.

 Chhotka will be kept under observation for six months and his bail would be rejected if he is found to have tortured his wife.

 When Chhotka left court, four motorcyclists tried to whisk him away. They are believed to be his friends in an attempt to rescue him, a bid those present managed to prevent.

 He was later taken to Kalighat, and it was decided the marriage would be conducted outside the temple.

 There, another attempt to grab Chhotka was foiled, at which point officers from Alipore police station intervened and the ceremony was conducted under strict police vigil.

 ?The marriage was held from the point of view of social recognition, even if she is a minor and not of marriageable age. Now, the girl finally has a home and the father of the child has accepted her as his wife. This is what Tumpa was fighting for,? Chakraborty said.

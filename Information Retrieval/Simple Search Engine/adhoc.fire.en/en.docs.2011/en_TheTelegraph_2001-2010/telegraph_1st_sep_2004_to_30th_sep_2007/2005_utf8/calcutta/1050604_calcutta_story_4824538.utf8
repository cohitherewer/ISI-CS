 Hilsa plea to Delhi

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Even as the embargo on hilsa imports from Bangladesh via land continued for the 20th day on Friday, Bengal fisheries minister Kiranmoy Nanda took up the matter with the Union agriculture ministry?s department of animal husbandry. 

 Nanda spoke to Union animal husbandry secretary P.M.A. Hakim, requesting him to withdraw hilsa from the list of items classified as animal husbandry, fishery and dairy produce that require sanitation checks for import by land.

 ?How can fish be classified as livestock? The Centre can easily amend this rule. It involves the sentiments of two nations,? said Nanda on Friday at Writers? Buildings.

 The agricultural ministry had in a 2001 notification included hilsa in the list of livestock items that have to be accompanied by a sanitary import slip (SIP).

 The Hilsa Fresh Fish Importers? Association has not been able to bring in the fish by land since May 15 because of the Central embargo.

 The association imports over 5,000 metric tonnes of hilsa to Bengal annually. West Bengal, which consumes between 20,000 and 25,000 tonnes of hilsa annually, gets the rest from Digha, Shankarpur, Bakkhali, Frazergunj and Orissa.

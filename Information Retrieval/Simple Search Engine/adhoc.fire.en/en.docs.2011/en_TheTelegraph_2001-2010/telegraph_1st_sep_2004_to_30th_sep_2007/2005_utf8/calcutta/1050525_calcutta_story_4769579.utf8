In summer, people crave for refreshing juices and India, fortunately, offers a wide variety of tropical fruits. Be it mangoes virtually falling off every tree, to watermelons, litchis, strawberries and even the alien kiwi, the subcontinent juxtaposes its sweltering summers with its refreshing variety of fresh fruits.

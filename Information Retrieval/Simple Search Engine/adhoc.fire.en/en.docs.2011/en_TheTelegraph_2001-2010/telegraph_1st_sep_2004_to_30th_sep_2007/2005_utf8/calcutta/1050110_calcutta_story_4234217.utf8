In the middle of the cricket matches, hit movies and 

saas-bahu dramas, there is a heavy demand for watching lifestyle and fashion 

shows on the small screen. And Calcutta has its own favourites as is evident from 

this list of most watched shows between December 19 and 25, 2004 as measured by 

Television Audience Measurement (TAM).

 Naari on Alpha Bangla is at the top 

of the charts with a TRP count of 0.93. That the tally couldn?t even reach one, 

only shows that lifestyle and fashion are still way down on the priority list 

for Calcuttans.

was the second most watched show with a TRP tally of 0.62.

 Good Living on Sony is at number three 

notching up 0.37 points.

 Shree Moyee on Akash Bangla is in fourth 

spot with just 0.27 in its kitty.

having been able to garner only 0.25 points.

spot with Lifestyle, having also fetched 0.25 points for the week.

Geographic Channel is at number seven with 0.23 points.

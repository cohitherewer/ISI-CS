 Global software giant Microsoft on Thursday signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the West Bengal government to roll out its Project Bhasha in the state. 

 The initiative is part of Microsoft?s ?comprehensive enablement? strategy, which aims to customise local language applications and undertake system integration for Microsoft products.

 ?The idea is to make available the same feature set for Microsoft products in various languages,? said Ranjivjit Singh, director, marketing amp; business operations, Microsoft India.

 The MoU will enable the Redmond-headquartered IT major to work with the state government in providing local language support and enablement, besides seeking government support to ensure development of regional language applications around Microsoft?s Unicode protocol.

 ?We are also keen on joining the e-governance initiatives,? said Singh. 

 Microsoft is associated with the government?s web portal, used extensively in the health sector and for maintenance of law and order. Besides Bengal, the company is also involved in e-governance in Karnataka and Haryana.

 Microsoft has recently joined hands with state government to set up a centre of excellence, Bhasha Localization Lab, to train students in developing language-based IT applications. ?The site of the proposed centre will be decided by the government,? said Singh. 

 According to the agreement, Microsoft will provide hardware, software and training support at the institute.

 Besides signing up with the government for the language initiative, Microsoft also previewed its Windows operating system and Office software in Bengali on Thursday. 

 ?This goes beyond providing only fonts for viewing documents in other languages and looks at a complete user experience,? said Raveesh Gupta, program manager, localisation, Microsoft India, after previewing the Bengali version of Windows XP operating system and the Office 2003 software. 

 Microsoft provides support to 11 other Indian languages, while Bengali is the third language for which it is offering a complete interface.

 ?The user only needs to download a free language interface pack for the operating system and Office to work in Bengali,? explained Gupta.

 School cleft over voting rights

 SANJAY MANDAL

 The managements of the two sections of Patha Bhavan, a leading school in the city, are locking horns over teachers? right to vote for the integrated managing committee.

 The montessori and primary section of the school, founded in 1965, is yet to be recognised by the state government. And on this ground, principal Ishita Das has ruled out the possibility of the teachers of this section to vote in the upcoming election.

 As a counter-measure, the authorities of the montessori and primary section have approached chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, whose daughter was a student of the school. ?Please help us get the recognition, without which our section will not have an identity (and our teachers will not be allowed to vote),? the appeal reads.

 The education department, however, has refused to intervene in the matter. School education minister Kanti Biswas said: ?Only a handful of teachers receive dearness allowance, so most are not recognised. Besides, we do not pay any salary to them. They are governed by rules framed by the school authorities.? 

 Principal Das is quite categorical: ?Only approved teachers can vote in the election. So, automatically, montessori and primary teachers are left out.? 

 Which means, only 37 of 110-odd teachers have voting rights. (Apart from the recognition, a teacher must get dearness allowance to be eligible to vote. So, even 23 teachers of the senior section do not have voting rights.)

 Besides appealing to the chief minister, nearly 50 teachers and non-teaching employees of the montessori and primary section have urged the school secretary to help them get voting rights. 

 ?We are looking forward to the integrated committee, but we do hope that a democratic spirit will be upheld in the process of integration of all sections,? the letter to the secretary states.

 The school education directorate in December had granted permission for the integrated managing committee. But in the absence of recognition of one of the sections, a large number of teachers will not be represented on the panel, said a member of the present managing committee.

 Pradipta Kanungo, headmistress of the primary section, rued that most of her students were refused admission when they moved to other states. ?The guardians are asked to produce certificates from the district inspector of schools, as the transfer certificate from the school is not enough. But the inspector does not issue a certificate, as our section is not recognised.?

 There is also confusion over the voting rights of the guardians. The montessori and primary teachers claimed that since they did not have voting rights, guardians, too, would not be allowed to vote. 

 But principal Das rejected the claim. ?The government has told us that whoever pays fees is a guardian. There is no written order, but the government has verbally assured us that the guardians would be allowed to vote,? she said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Memory game and power trip

 Q amp; A 

 Thanks for writing in. Keep the emails coming!

 Sandip Karmakar: My configuration 

 is AMD Athlon 2400XP+ processor, Asrock K7VM2 motherboard 

 and 256 MB DDR RAM. From the day of purchase, my Unitron 

 UPS isn?t working properly. When the power supply is disconnected, 

 my computer trips and restarts, which results in improper 

 shutdown. I informed the UPS manufacturer and they replaced 

 my set. But the problem persists. Now, the UPS manufacturers 

 are saying that my BIOS setting is incorrect. I have not 

 found any relevant option in the BIOS except ?Over Vcore 

 Voltage?, which is disabled. Will enabling it solve the 

 problem? 

 TechTalk: There isn?t any 

 relevant BIOS setting that can solve your problem. The UPS 

 seems to be faulty. Assuming you have a generic 17? monitor, 

 a single hard-drive and a single CDROM/DVD-ROM drive with 

 the rest of the configuration provided, your system consumes 

 close to 400W or 560VA (Voltamps) of power without a printer 

 or other power-consuming equipment connected to the UPS. 

 Check it with a good UPS of 600VA rating.

 Swarnava Seal: I have an 

 Intel Pentium IV processor, 256 MB RAM and Windows 98 and 

 Windows XP. While playing some games, I got an alert that 

 the temperature in System Zone 2 of the CPU had risen.

 TechTalk: To play latest 

 games like Doom 3 or Half Life 2, you need 

 high-end graphics cards that have their own faster graphics 

 memory (VRAM) and separate graphics data processing unit 

 (GPU). You need not worry about the temperature warning 

 as long as there is no crash. System Zone 2 refers to the 

 area where the system RAM is located. Intel Active Monitor 

 sends the alert because the warning temperature has been 

 set too low for your system.

 Write in with your computer- related problems to TechTalk. 

 Be sure to include the configuration of your PC and be specific 

 about the problem. Write to techtalkabpmail.com

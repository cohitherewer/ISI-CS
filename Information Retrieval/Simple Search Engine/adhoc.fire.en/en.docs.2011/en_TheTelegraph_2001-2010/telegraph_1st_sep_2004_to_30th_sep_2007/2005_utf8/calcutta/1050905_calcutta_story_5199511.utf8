Screen On amp; Off

It takes two to Tolly tango

With four hit films behind them and two more on the 

floors, they are the hottest jodi in tinsel town. Reshmi Sengupta asks 

them why

KOEL

It was his second film and her first, but they both 

got it right in their very first attempt together. After the success of Nater 

Guru in 2003, Jeet and Koel teamed up for three more films ? Bandhan, Manik 

and this year?s first hit Juddha. On the floors is their biggest venture 

till date ? Shubha Drishti, riding high on the fame of Rajshri Films ? 

and one more with the king of potboilers, Swapan Saha.

Though keen to cement their top spots in the quicksand 

of Tollywood, both stars are wary of over-exposure as a lead pair. So if Jeet 

has paired up with Swastika Mukherjee for Biresh Chatterjee?s Saathihara, 

Koel is starring opposite Jisshu Sengupta in Anup Sengupta?s forthcoming film.

?People may not like us (together) for a very long 

time. Seeing the same pair over and over again can be boring? And as an actress 

I should be able to give my best despite who my co-actor is. But there?s a huge 

dearth of heroes in Tollywood, so the choice is limited. Heroines are coming in 

droves,? laughs Koel, who had almost decided to call it quits while shooting for 

Nater Guru. 

?Frankly, I thought my first film would be my last 

because I wanted to finish my studies. Then there was Raja Sen?s Devipaksha, 

Shudhu Tumi and Badshah. Bandhan offered me a double role 

that was very challenging, and I took it up as it came to me so early in life. 

After Nater Guru, here was Jeet with me again and producers started having 

faith in us. We have a very good screen chemistry and I think that has clicked 

for us. Fresh faces and a fresh look was all that mattered,? feels the daughter 

of Ranjit Mullick.

If she looks completely comfortable sharing screen 

space with Jeet these days, the start of the partnership wasn?t quite so smooth. 

?I wasn?t very comfortable with Jeet in Nater Guru. I thought I was stiff 

while doing the romantic scenes,? admits Koel.

?As we worked more together, the inhibitions started 

fading. Now, we have a very good understanding,? says Koel, flashing the smile 

that is lighting up the Bengali big screen.

JEET

Romantic hero, boy-next-door or action man ? Jeet 

is comfortable in any role his audiences like to see him in. After TV serials 

in Mumbai and a Telugu film, it was Tollywood where he has settled down in. After 

a string of 10 films in four years, the lanky youth is a serious ? though still 

distant ? contender for Prosenjit?s number one slot.

Dismissing any talk of being in the rat race, Jeet 

says: ?I don?t believe in ranking. I think I am in a better position than a few 

others and there?s a lot to do. And I also don?t follow any particular image. 

I try and mould myself according to the character.?

Having worked with Jisshu (Premi) and Mithun 

Chakraborty (Juddha), Jeet doesn?t have any qualms sharing screen space 

with ?rivals? either. ?I wouldn?t mind working with other heroes. It?s fun working 

in a team. But while shooting for Juddha, I was aware that I was working 

with a big hero? bigger than me. So I had to be a little more cautious and put 

more effort,? says Jeet, whose lady loves on screen have ranged from Priyanka 

Trivedi to Reshmi Ghosh, Rituparna Sengupta to Chandana Bhowmick.

Yet, it?s Koel that he has stuck to the most and scored 

the maximum hits.

So, what has clicked for him and Koel as a couple? 

?The freshness, which springs from the screen chemistry. Our viewers are mostly 

youths, so they can relate to us very well,? feels Jeet, an admirer of Uttam-Suchitra. 

?In Bollywood, I think Amitabh and Rekha were excellent, Kajol and Shah Rukh were 

also very good.?

Yet, like Koel, he apprehends an overkill. ?It?s very 

important to pair up with other actors. You have to keep changing, otherwise it 

gets monotonous. Uttam-Suchitra may have survived in memory more than the rest, 

but even both of them had worked with other actors and actresses,? Jeet reasons.

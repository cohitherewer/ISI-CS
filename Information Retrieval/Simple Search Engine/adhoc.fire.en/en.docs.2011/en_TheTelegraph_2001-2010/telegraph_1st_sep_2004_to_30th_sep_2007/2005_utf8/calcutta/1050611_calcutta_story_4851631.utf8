 If you are in the mood to pamper your son-in-law, Jamai Sashthi has come just in time. This Monday, if you have ruled out an elaborate spread at home, head for a city restaurant instead.

 If you want to stick to tradition, Kewpies is where you should head. The Elgin Lane Bengali speciality address has introduced a wide array of delicacies to humour hungry jamais. Jamai Abhyarthana Thala, Jamai Boron Thala and Jamai Jamjamat Thala are the three set meals on offer, priced between Rs 285 and Rs 340.

 Ghee bhaat or pulao, luchi, Shukto or Alur Dom are the basics, followed by a wide choice of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes.

 For select specials, choose from Pias Ilish Paturi, Narains Chitol Petir Jhaal, Kewpies Chingri Maachher Dolma, Pishimas Pathar Jhol, Ratans Chhanar Dalna and Mithus Daab Jhinge. The pocket pinch here would be between Rs 45 and Rs 225.

 The idea is to make all the jamais feel special on this day. And the best way is to treat them to some exotic food, smiles Rakhi Purnima Dasgupta. The festival starts on June 12 and continues till June 19.

The elaborate feast at the Forum restaurant is priced at Rs 350.

 The Bhoj continues at Oh! Calcuttas sister concern, Mainland China. Here, the buffet takes in Sweet Corn Asparagus Soup, Chicken Treasure Soup, Crispy Vegetable Konjinaro, Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Dimsum, Pan Fried Chinese Greens, Braised Black Fungus and Bamboo Shoots, Potato Pepper Salt, Eggplant Hubei, Prawns in Chilli Oyster Sauce, Chicken Kungpao, Fish in Chinese Parsley Sauce, Crab Sichuan Style, Vegetable Hakka Noodles, Chilli Butter Garlic Noodles, Mixed Meat Fried Rice, Ginger Capsicum Fried Rice, ice cream with Darsaan and Date Pancakes.

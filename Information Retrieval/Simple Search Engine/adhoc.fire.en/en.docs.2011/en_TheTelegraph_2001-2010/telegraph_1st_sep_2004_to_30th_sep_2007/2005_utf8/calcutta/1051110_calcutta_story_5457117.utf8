 German giant Metro Cash amp; Carry will kick-off operations at the first of its three units planned in the city by the next festive season. Calcutta will be the group?s second stop after Bangalore.

 ?We should be up and running with our first distribution centre by September-October 2006,? Heinrich O.E. Birr, vice-president, international affairs, Metro Group, confirmed on Wednesday after a closed-door meeting with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Writers? Buildings. 

 Birr is co-leader of a German food-processing delegation on a two-day reconnoitre trip. ?We have met the chief minister three or four times before. But today?s discussion was the most fruitful and all the issues have been taken care of for us to come in,? said the top official of the Dusseldorf-based group, which notched up sales of 56.4 billion Euros last year.

 The government has promised the eight-acre plot required for Metro to set up its maiden centre on the EM Bypass by this year-end, besides pledging ?single-window clearance? for the 50-odd licences required for the supply-channel business.

 Work on the 120,000-sq ft distribution hub, to be developed at a cost of around Rs 70 crore ? will commence in January 2006 and should be completed in six to eight months, added Harsh Bahadur, managing director, Metro Cash amp; Carry India Pvt Ltd.

 ?We are not a hypermarket or a supermarket, nor are we open to any private end-consumer. Metro sells only to business customers and our primary clientele worldwide would be members of the hospitality industry, for whom we are a one-stop purchase point,? Birr clarified.

 Allaying fears in the corridors of Writers? that Metro?s entry might hurt interests of local retailers, he said: ?On the contrary, we can help them survive and grow by giving them more options under one roof and the most competitive prices.?

 Metro?s bullishness is based on food figures: a ?city walk? done by the German major identified ?70,000-plus food retailers and over 6,400 restaurants? in Calcutta and Howrah ? ?all potential customers, since 70 per cent of our business is food?, said Bahadur.

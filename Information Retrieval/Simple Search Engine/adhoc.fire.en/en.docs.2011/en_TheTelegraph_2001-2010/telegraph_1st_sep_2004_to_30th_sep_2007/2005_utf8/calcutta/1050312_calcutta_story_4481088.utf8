 Tables turned on teacher, with respect

 ?Neither teaching nor writing is easy for an ordinary person like me. I just continue to try.?

 Despite Nonda Chatterjee?s humble admission on Thursday evening at the launch of The Strawberry Patch, a collection of short stories, her students insist that the teacher of English and history made class seem like a cakewalk. Just as readers of the volume published by Penguin ? the veteran educator?s first literary effort ? are likely to agree that her lucid tales seem quite effortless.

 Chatterjee, the current principal of The Cambridge School and former principal of Calcutta International School, writes about the remarkable tales of eight real-life women, spanning the 20th century, whom she knew intimately. Some were famous, others were not, but all were exceptional for their strength, integrity and determination to survive with dignity.

 As arresting as these tales was the unusual book launch at the British Council. After introductions by ex-students Sanjukta Dasgupta (of Calcutta University) and Ayesha Mukherjee (who assisted Chatterjee with the manuscript), it was time for her current students to analyse their teacher?s work.

 This was an extension of Chatterjee?s classroom, but the tables were turned. The lady ? who has taught generations of students to, as Ayesha put it, ?objectively, independently and often ruthlessly? approach literature ? insisted her pupils stick to the same principles when it came to their principal.

 The panel of students had nothing to fear. Not only was this author likely to welcome constructive criticism, but her young readers also clearly connected with the stories. Each read out a passage from one of the eight tales and then went on to analyse it.

 During the Q amp;A session between audience and author, Chatterjee?s emotional involvement with these eight stories became clear. They are the fruits of ?a lifetime of reading and teaching?, she explained. ?I wanted to live a little first, before I felt like I had anything to say,? smiled Chatterjee, when asked why she waited so long to write her first book.

 Another is on its way. It is about jatra and is currently in the care of her literary agent.

 Because The Strawberry Patch stories were so close to Chatterjee?s heart, putting them down on paper became that much more of a challenge (?it was very difficult to do justice to them?).

 After moulding thousands of minds in search of just the right word, Chatterjee ? like her lively characters ? has chosen to lead by example, again.

 Just a few months ago, the Phoolbagan intersection was widened by reducing the size of the round-about and narrowing the road dividers. But vehicles are not able to use the entire width of the road, thanks to the pedestrians. But where would people walk if the pavements are encroached upon by roadside stalls? The eateries in front of an SBI branch throw leftovers along the road, dirtying the place. A decade down the line, Phoolbagan would need an Operation Sunshine. Wouldn?t it be prudent for the authorities to stop more shops from coming up on the footpaths in the area?

 The Centre on October 6 announced a hike in dearness allowance for staff and dearness relief for pensioners from July this year. While employees started availing of the benefit with their salaries a month after the announcement, pensioners have had to wait for around four months for it. Despite receipt of orders from the higher authorities, many nationalised banks and post offices cause unnecessary delay in processing the papers.

 The government finds hand-pulled rickshaws inhumane. What about the Corporation?s conservancy staff? They collect the garbage with their bare hands and even climb down into drains to clean them. The government should provide them with proper brooms, gloves and other equipment to clear the waste.

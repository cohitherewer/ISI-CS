 They started as a magazine, went on to open a club and now theyre on mission merchandise. After contests, addas, grooming sessions and more, Unish Kuri, the popular Bengali magazine for the youth brigade, has forayed into fashion. The range, catchily called UK, was launched at the UK Fashion Carnival on Sunday at DI.

 The event kicked off with city models and youth icons Parambrata, Koneenica, Sidhu of Cactus, Subhojit of Lakkhichhara and Tuki and Chandrani of Krosswindz walking the ramp.

 Cool and Bindaas, as the collection is called, comprised colourful and trendy apparel, chic jewellery, strappy footwear, pretty bags and even mugs to match.

 Todays youth is fashion conscious and they know what looks good. The collection is wearable fashion and reflects a lot of fun, colour and enthusiasm, smiled Parambrata.

 What about the ramp experience? I was a bit scared, admitted the actor. But it certainly didnt show as the screen Topshe was all cool and casual during the catwalk.

 The first sequence included T-shirts for boys and ponchos for the girls in myriad shades. The use of colour and motifs is synonymous with todays youth, felt Nabina Gupta, one of the designers. The ponchos had motifs, while the T-shirts had catchy phrases like Dil Maange More. 

 Frilly tops, strappy kurtas with zari borders, sleeveless jackets, casual shirts and collared kurtis were also on show. The palette ranged from solid whites and black to vibrant reds, pinks and blues.

 It was east meets west with the kalamkari print churidar tops for girls and earthy-hued kurtas in stripes and prints for boys. Loose trousers with short kurtas defined the semi-formals line.

 But to be yourself is the best fashion statement, pointed out designer K. Padmaja. 

 I plan to pursue an MA in social work, but designing will always be a part of my life. After all, creativity lies in your mind, is what the youngest designer in the trio, Gargi Sen, had to say.

 The fashion show was choreographed by The Dream Merchants, with Sourav Ali in charge of the make-up. 

 Then there was Daksha Abhineta, hosted by Paroma Banerjee. Participants imitated characters and personalities ranging from Spiderman to John Abraham to Laloo Prasad Yadav. Later in the evening, Bangla Band Lakkhichhara rocked DI.

 October 3 and 4 saw sessions on braiding, nail art, tattoo, hair-setting, ear-piercing, grooming and games like Ki Sahosh: Truth or Dare hosted by Sidhu, Nije RJ by 93.5 Red FM RJs Rakesh and Pragya, and U amp;K: Romance and Dating with Paroma and Shilajit. Krosswindz and Shilajit also performed.

 Those who missed the masti can take solace ? UK products will soon be in markets and malls.

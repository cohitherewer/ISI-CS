 Jason Dasey: In the thick of action

 He has spent around a quarter of a century in journalism, shifting base from country to country. Yet, the passion for sports makes Jason Dasey return to the television screen every night.

 ?Greg Chappell was the captain of Australia when I started out,? says the presenter of Sportscenter Asia and Sportcenter India on ESPN. ?It?s come a full circle now with him being appointed the Indian coach.? Based in Singapore, Dasey was in Delhi last week, visiting friends and tying up business threads.

 The Australian has had a flair for sports since childhood, studying and playing cricket in North Sydney Boys High, a couple of batches junior to Allan Border. ?I also enjoyed writing and started to contribute articles on sports as a hobby,? says Dasey. It was on to The Sydney Morning Herald from there, one of the oldest newspapers in Australia, covering police, politics and sports. 

 That lasted for four years after which Dasey switched to television. Stints in BBC, Reuters, Sky News and CNN followed till he decided to join ESPN in 2001. ?I spent seven years in the UK, four in the US and for the past four years I?ve been stationed in Singapore.?

 The reason for taking up the ESPN offer was because he ?terribly missed cricket?. Now, meeting international sports superstars is a routine affair and something that excites Dasey. ?You?re so in awe of them but you also have to act as a professional and ask the right questions. Besides, deep down everyone is the same.?

 One of the more memorable incidents was interviewing Sunil Gavaskar after India defeated Pakistan in Pakistan. ?I knew it was truly something special, particularly knowing what that victory meant to him. He was all emotional,? Dasey recalls.

 Over the years, the cricket coverage has changed a lot, Dasey feels. ?It has gone beyond the scores and statistics to more of analysis. It has also become more sophisticated now. But you have to strike a balance and not over-analyse,? suggests Dasey.

 Despite his busy schedule, the man manages to participate in half-marathons, play ?social? tennis and cricket and swim a km everyday.

 Looking ahead, it?s Ashes with Akram, as he hosts the traditional battle between England and Australia with Wasim Akram. Also on the cards is learning Hindi and then Bengali. ?I can say words like shukriya and romanchak. Let?s see how much I can pick up and how soon,? laughs Dasey.

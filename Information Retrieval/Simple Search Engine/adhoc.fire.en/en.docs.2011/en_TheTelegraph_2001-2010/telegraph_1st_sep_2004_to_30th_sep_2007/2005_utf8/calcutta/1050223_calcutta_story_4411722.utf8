Surprise party for beloved?s birthday

 It was Nelanjanaas first birthday after marriage and hubby Jisshu Sengupta 

wanted to make it extra special. The result was a surprise party at Red Kitchen 

and Lounge with a group of close friends on Monday evening. Talking her into coming 

out for dinner to the restaurant, Jisshu had their friends waiting at the venue 

with balloons, cake, champagne the works. The sudden surprise bowled the 

lady over and the twosome danced the night away, literally. Pictures by Rashbehari

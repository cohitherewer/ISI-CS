 You share your birthday with...

 Chloe Sevigny 

You?re resourceful, and when you have experience under your belt, you?re a perfect partner in business and maybe even in romance. You?re outgoing, confident and energetic. You?re not selfish; you just know what you want. People recognise your drive, independent mind and determination. You?re always hungry for attention and respect. You simply hate losing. ? Kusum Bhandari

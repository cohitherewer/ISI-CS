The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Next weekend you can be at... KHARDAH

 Khardah is five railway stations 

 away from Sealdah. Along with Belgharia and Agarpara, this 

 township falls in what used to be the industrial belt of 

 Bengal. The thousands of workers who had migrated here about 

 a century ago from Bihar and Orissa form a large part of 

 the populace and give it a distinctive colour. Close by, 

 what used to be known as the coolie lines are several paras 

 where caste Hindus live.

 Unlike the warren of tiny airless 

 brick boxes where the workforce survives, most of the houses 

 of upper caste Bengalis are well constructed. They?ve seen 

 better days, but are still distinguished by columns, thakurdalans 

 and ornamental grilles. Rabindranath had sojourned in Khardah 

 in a house swallowed by the river.

 The Vaishnavite cult has left 

 its mark on Khardah. Nityananda Prabhu, a disciple of Sri 

 Krishna Chaitanya, had settled in a thatched hut here. It 

 is now a humble brick structure known as Kunjabati. His 

 son Bir Bhadra Goswami had started the worship of Shyamsundar 

 that subsequently became the presiding deity of Khardah.

 It is said that about 250 years 

 ago, a woman named Pateswari Ma Goswami had raised the famous 

 Shyamsundar temple, that dominates Raskhola, after her husband, 

 who had been imprisoned by Nawab Alibardi Khan, was released. 

 The temple compound has a large 

 kitchen and natmancha, and close to the Hooghly banks 

 are the ratha-shaped Rasmancha and Dolmancha. The 

 sanctity of the Dolmancha has been violated by blocking 

 the archway. Recent attempts at decorating the main temple 

 with white panels depicting Krishnalila are quite appalling. 

 Adjacent to the Shyamsundar temple is a smaller one dedicated 

 to Madanmohan. Khardah is famous for its Ras and Dol celebrations.

 A short walk from Shyamsundar 

 leads to another fascinating complex of 26 dochala Shiva 

 temples. These are mostly dilapidated but are being restored 

 by the Archaeological Survey of India. They were constructed 

 in the early 19th century by Ramhari Biswas and his son 

 Prankrishna, whose ambition it was to establish a Ratnabedi 

 like the one in Puri with one lakh Shiva lingas. 

 He managed to gather about 80,000 before his death. The 

 ornamented door frames of the 26 temples are from the Gaur 

 ruins. The navaratna Mahaprabhu temple with nine 

 spires is on the way to the temple complex. 

 A large chunk of the mill labour 

 force in Khardah is Muslim. In 1907 these poor workers had 

 built a magnificent mosque on MG Road (formerly Trever Road). 

 Its portal and minarets and walls of the inner sanctum are 

 richly embellished with tiny ceramic tiles in bright hues 

 that create the effect of minakari. Calcutta once 

 had several mosques decorated with crazy China mosaic. The 

 glazed surfaces of most are chipped. But the Khardah mosque 

 is in mint condition.

 How to reach: 

 Khardah is easily accessible by 

 road and river. Catch a bus to Barrackpore from Howrah station 

 or Esplanade. 

 From Howrah, the route numbers 

 are 56 and GL31. From Esplanade, it?s L20, S11 (state) and 

 78. State buses are few and far between.

 There are minibuses from Dalhousie 

 Square to Khardah, besides the new private buses plying 

 between Barrackpore and Santragachhi.

 Any local train from Sealdah station 

 to Krishnagar, Santipur, Ranaghat, Kalyani, Naihati or Barrackpore 

 stops at Khardah.

 It can also be reached by launch 

 from Rishra

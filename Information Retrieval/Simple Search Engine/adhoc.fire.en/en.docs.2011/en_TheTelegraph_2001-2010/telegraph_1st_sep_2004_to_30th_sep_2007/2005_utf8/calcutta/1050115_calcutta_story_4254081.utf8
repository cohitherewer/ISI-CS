 It's Your Birthday So...

 You 

are always open to new ideas and opinions as avenues of self-improvement. Your 

logical and quick mind is a great asset. You are cautious and sensible, especially 

when making decisions on relationships. Others look upon you as a leader. Someone 

gentle, ready to pamper you, will be a great partner. ? Kusum Bhandari

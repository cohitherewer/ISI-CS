 Kurti call in fashion fusion 

 From linen and cotton regular wear to gorgeous embellished ones in chiffon and crepe, the cropped version of the kurta throws up options for all occasions, says Ipsita Deb

 Pair them with jeans, capris, long skirts or patialas and stylishly sail through college campuses, business luncheons and cocktail parties. Kurti ? a cross between the western top and the Indian kurta ? has invaded wardrobes of women across the country.

 While the Indo-western feel offered by the hip little garment is largely responsible for its popularity, the other factor adding to its appeal is versatility. While you can pair cotton kurtis with your jeans for your college dress code, the chiffon version of the garment teamed with a stylish skirt can make perfect party wear.

 Goodlife explores the various gifts of the garment.

 Casual code

 Cotton and linen kurtis can be paired with classic denims, trousers, slitted cotton skirts, and even salwars and churidars. Simple yet trendy, the malls are flooded with these in a variety of colours and nice summery prints.

 A wide range of georgette and cotton kurtis, ideal for college wear, can be found with bright floral prints, geometric shapes and minimal embroidery. The sleeves vary ? from the sleeveless to the quarter-sleeved to the full-sleeved. 

 ?Kurtis are very hip and trendy. The major plus-point of the garment is that it suits every body type. I like to match it with jholas and chappals,? says model Priyanka Nandi. 

 Apart from being fashionable, the garment scores high on the comfort factor, too, and can be worn in every season. While the cotton ones can beat the summer heat, kurtis in viscose georgette, polyester georgette and crepe blends are ideal for the monsoons. 

 Glam buys

 Sparkling sequins, extensive zardosi work, chikankari and intricate embroidery embellish kurtis in chiffon and crepes. These gorgeous pieces are ideal for cocktails and formal dos. 

 The surface ornamentation techniques extend to block printing, cross-stitch, kantha work, bead work and mirror work. Available with most designers as well as in the malls, there are lots of innovations on the necklines and styling.

 ?Kurtis make for great party wear or formal-occasion wear, especially at a do where you want to strike a good Indo-western balance,? says actress Raima Sen. 

 Mix n match

 Since the length of the kurti varies from just below the waist to mid-thigh and can be tight-fitted or loose, these can be worn with a variety of lowers.

 If youre headed for a traditional gathering, the good bet would be to pair a kurti with a salwar or patiala for a voluminous look or a churidar for a slim feel.

 On an occasion that demands western wear, you can team the garment with slim-fit pants, either ankle-length or capris. Worn over denim lowers, the garment makes for stylish casual wear.

 The garment can be accessorised with colourful dupattas, scarves and stoles. ?I dont think short kurtis are in anymore. Personally, Id wear mid-thigh-length ones over my denims in summer, with a low-slung belt to keep it all together and lend a chic effect,? says designer Kiran Uttam Ghosh.

 Hot haunts

 If designer studios and posh boutiques dont suit your budget, you can hit the malls flooded with kurtis of every variety. Be it Shoppers Stop, Westside or Pantaloons, Fabindia or Anokhi, kurtis fill up the racks of all these stores. The price point starts from Rs 300. ?Cotton kurtis are doing very well this summer with women of all age groups. These are very fashionable yet priced very affordably,? says Santanu Sen, store manager Shoppers Stop, Forum.

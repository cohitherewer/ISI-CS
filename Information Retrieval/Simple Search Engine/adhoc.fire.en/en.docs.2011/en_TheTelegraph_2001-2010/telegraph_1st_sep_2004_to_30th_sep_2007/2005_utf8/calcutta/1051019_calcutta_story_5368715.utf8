Fire and earth to rule the roost

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

Q: I am a single working woman born on 31.05.1973. 

I am a complete failure in matters of money and relationships. I live in an apartment 

where the south-east sector has a bathroom, the middle south has a veranda and 

the entire south-west corner is missing. It is not possible for my family and 

me to relocate any of the rooms. My relationships dont seem to start even 

when I meet somebody who seems to be compatible. Recently I met a guy in Delhi 

and we got very friendly, but all of a sudden he stopped communicating when I 

returned to Calcutta after an official training of nine months. He has now gone 

abroad for a year. But I still have this hunch that something might work out with 

this guy. I am quite depressed now and sometimes feel like giving up on life. 

Please help.

PM

THE SOLUTION: Your financial condition can 

be taken care of by suppressing the energy that is being drained away in the south-east 

toilet. Keep a heavy stone in the south-east corner and hang a five-rod solid 

metal wind-chime from above. Also keep a small bowl filled with salt till the 

brim on the window sill of the toilet. 

The south-west corner of the house is ruled by feminine 

energy. When this area falls out of the house, relationships and marriages become 

difficult for the women of the house. 

Strengthen all the south-west corners of the house 

with earth and fire elements. Earth means artefacts made of terracotta, stone, 

marble, onyx, amethyst rocks and crystals. 

Fire can be introduced with the help of lamps and 

candles. Remember to place everything in pairs here as this is considered to be 

the marriage area in general. According to your kua number, this is also your 

personal marriage direction. 

Make sure that you enhance this corner fast as chances 

are very bright this year for you to tie nuptial knots, otherwise they get extended 

to 2007.

Career course

Q: My son was born on 18.03.1982 at 7.56 

pm in Dhanbad. He has taken his final exams in engineering this year and is awaiting 

the results. At the same time he is preparing to take the CAT for management this 

year. Will he be successful in getting admission to one of the IIMs? It is important 

that he does since he is not interested in any other management institute.

N. Verma

THE SOLUTION: Your son is a weak metal person 

and is passing through the phase of fire since 2002. This element has directly 

reshaped his life giving him good education. He continues to be in this phase 

till 2008 and then for the next 10 years this element comes in a bigger force 

where its influence will make him a successful professional and help him enjoy 

a very high status in life. 

Next year, the ruling elements that are coming in 

power are fire and earth. Fire signifies a change from the existing place and 

earth represents good education and qualification for him. Chances are very bright 

that he would settle abroad. Your son has a wonderful chart where he will never 

look back in his life. 

Strengthen him by surrounding him with metal and earth 

elements and their related colours like white, beige, cream, yellow and brown.

Study matters

Q: My date of birth is 23.3.1990 at 5.30 

pm. I am currently studying in class XI with science subjects. I am suffering 

from lack of concentration and would like you to suggest some measures to combat 

this problem. I am also suffering from a skin disease, but at present the condition 

is under control. Can you please suggest some remedies that will help in early 

recovery from the disease? Also, please tell me my element, lucky number, colour 

and favourable direction for studying. What kind of posters should I put up in 

my bedroom wall?

Shashank Gupta

THE SOLUTION: According to your pillars of 

destiny you are a strong fire person with four elements of fire and two elements 

of wood to support you. Excess of fire element directly attacks and irritates 

the metal element, which is connected with the skin. Water is an essential element 

for you to keep the fire element under control. 

Simultaneously exhaust its energy by surrounding yourself 

with earth and metal elements. Drink plenty of water from a silver glass and keep 

metallic objects on your bedside table and wear a metal band. 

Your lucky number is 1 and favourable directions in 

order of preference are south-east, east, south and north. You should put up inspirational 

posters of role models and ones that predominantly have shades of blue in them.

West woes

Q: I am a doctor practising medicine in 

my own chamber in Calcutta. I live in a three-storied house that has a 10-ft open 

passage at the back, within the boundary where there is a water reservoir in the 

south-west corner. My house is on a corner plot where the north-east portion is 

surrounded by the road and the south-west corner is enclosed within my boundary 

wall. I had no other choice but to have the underground water reservoir in the 

south-west in the enclosed area. Is this construction against Feng Shui or Vastu? 

If so, what is the remedy?

Dr Nikhil Saha

THE SOLUTION: Having an underground water reservoir 

in the south-west is definitely against both Feng Shui and Vastu. This area is 

ruled by earth energy, which provides stability to the residents of a house and 

hence should be elevated. When a depression is made here by digging the ground 

for a water reservoir, it shakes the stability of the residents. 

In your case, as there is no other option you could 

create a balance by raising the ground area around the water tank and place heavy 

potted plants on it. Also plant trees along the south-west boundary wall that 

will grow into tall trees and provide you with support in future.

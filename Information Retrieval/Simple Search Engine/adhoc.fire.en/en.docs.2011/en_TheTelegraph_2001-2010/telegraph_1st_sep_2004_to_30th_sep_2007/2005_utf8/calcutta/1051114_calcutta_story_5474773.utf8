 Oriental odyssey: Katie Leung plays Cho Chang in Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire

 As action shifts to Hogwarts from Friday, Metro brings you up, close and personal with the new members of the Potter family as they appear in the fourth film, Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire.

 One of the most delicate developments in his fourth year at the school of wizardry and witchcraft is Harry?s romantic urge. Eighteen-year-old Katie Leung, in her first-ever acting role, plays Cho Chang, a Ravenclaw at Hogwarts who is the object of Harry?s affectionate gaze.

 It wasn?t that tough for Katie to bag one of the most coveted screen roles of all time. ?My audition was classical,? says Katie. ?I was working with a French casting director on something else. And he said, ?Okay, I?m doing the Harry Potter casting. Would you like to come?? So we had a little chat and then (director) Mike (Newell) was in Paris promoting Mona Lisa Smile. So, I met him in a hotel. We had a little chat. And then I think we were three left, and all came to London to audition in a very short scene. And that was it.?

 It?s not that the film introduced Katie to the JK Rowling creation for the first time. ?I love the books,? she says. ?I had read the first four. I?d seen the first movie, and then I saw the third one on set, actually. I loved the whole universe and the whole world of Harry Potter.?

 And the girl does know where she is coming from, in the Potter scheme of things. ?My character, Cho, basically shows that Harry is developing into a teenager,? she explains. ?It?s like a hormonal change, and he becomes interested in girls. And basically I?m his crush.?

 The impact of getting to debut in such a high-profile film has helped Katie the girl. ?It has not really changed (my life) apart from the fact that I know I can act,? she feels. ?And also it has really brought me a lot of confidence ? being able to act in front of so many people, in front of cameras, and getting to meet new people as well, and interacting with everyone.?

 And she has already started enjoying the admiration and adulation for her new-found off-screen status even though the film hasn?t yet released officially. ?No matter how much you try to prepare for it, it?s going to be beyond your expectations what?s going to happen,? Katie feels about her soaring popularity . ?One morning, when I was coming back to my hotel, there were some photographers and fans outside. It was just terrifying. But, at the same time, it?s a really nice feeling as well. It means something to them. I think it would be a really good experience, yeah.?

 But if given a choice, Katie may not wish to remain as Cho in the Potter world. ?I think I would love to play Ron?s (Weasley) part because he is the comical guy. He seems to be able to make everyone laugh, even in the saddest times. The film is really tragic, yet humour comes up everywhere. It?s just hilarious. I?d love to make people laugh ?cause I can?t do that in real life.?

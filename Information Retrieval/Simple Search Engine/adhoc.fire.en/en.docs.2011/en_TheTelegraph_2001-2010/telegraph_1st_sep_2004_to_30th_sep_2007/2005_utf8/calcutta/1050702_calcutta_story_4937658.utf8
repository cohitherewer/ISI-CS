The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The final journey

 Based on a novel by Kamal Kumar Mazumdar, Gobardanga Shilpayans production, Antarjali Jatra, is a commentary on the cruelty and barbarism that women were subjected to in olden days. Being staged as part of Hutch Odeon 2005, the ongoing theatre festival that aims to promote Calcutta?s cultural heritage, it is a heart-wrenching performance that evokes feelings of pity, compassion and outrage at the heinous practices that were committed against women in the name of religious customs and rituals. The play relates the story of Jashobati, a beautiful, young girl, who becomes a victim of the Hindu koulinya protha. Born into a poor family, her father is compelled to marry her off to an old, dying man, or else the bride?s family runs the risk of being ostracised for not following a custom (protha) believed to be sacrosanct by upper class Hindus. As his newly wed bride, Jashobati accompanies her groom to the riverside, waiting for him to die. Surprisingly, Baijunath, a dom at the burning ghat, is the only one to express any feeling of humanity at the poor girl?s fate. Direction: Ashis Chattopadhyay.

 Monsoon survival mantra

 While you brave the puddles and pools of muck, keep a check on your hemline. Ipsita Deb lists the styles that will help you spend this rainy season both spotless and trendy

 While rainy days are a welcome change from the scorching summer heat, altering ones style to beat the splashy muck and puddles can be quite a challenge.

 So what is true rain style? Is it all about colourful umbrellas, cool windcheaters and zip-up or buttoned raincoats, or are there other escape routes from the grime?

 Cover call

 The umbrella is undoubtedly the most popular item on the monsoon style block. 

 The rainy season is the time when umbrellas are brought out of the closet and put to use. The key here is of course to make sure the colours are bright and trendy. Aquamarine, canary yellow, silver, gold or coral ? its the colour codes that spell the chic look, says designer Kiran Uttam Ghosh.

 Whats more, this item can be readily found anywhere ? the footpaths, markets or malls. When the weather becomes dreary, the colours one uses should contrast it and get really bright, she adds.

 There are fashionable and colourful raincoats to choose from as well and when purchasing these, it helps to keep in mind that people will be seeing the coat and not whats inside. Those with belts are good bets as they tend to be figure-enhancing as well as stylish.

 A new fad is transparent raincoats that look as thin as polythene and usually come with a smart plastic zipper. The good thing here is one can wear colourful clothes underneath and the transparent upper layer doesnt spoil the show.

 Top talk

 Keeping a stock of colourful, comfy tops is a good idea during the monsoon. But when you are out shopping, pay special attention to the fabric.

 Cottons are ideal for the monsoon as they dry fast. Embellished cotton kurtis, brightly printed T-shirts and any colour or style that is happy helps dispel the gloom of the season, says designer Komal Sood of Kyra.

 Leg show

 It doesnt hurt that skirts are the biggest fashion item of the year and are here to stay for some time. This garment perfectly follows the higher-from-ground-level principle, making it highly suitable during the rains, says Ghosh. For Sood, crushed skirts in bright hues is the monsoon mantra.

 Turn-up twist

 This season, say goodbye to hip-hugging jeans. Denims get very heavy when wet and take ages to dry. Cut-offs and turn-ups are perfect for this time of year. The worst thing that can happen is blackened edges with slush. Hence, utilising the shorter version of the trouser helps combat the chance of spotty hemlines, suggests Ghosh.

 Investing in a pair of cool turn-ups wont be a waste after the season as fashion gurus insist the style is here to stay.

 Ethnic edge

 If you prefer an ethnic look, short, bright kurtas minus the dupattas with tight churidars that will not graze the puddles are a good bet. The kurti paired with some cool capris are a great idea as well, offers Sood.

 Flip flop

 They save your leather shoes from being damaged, theyre fun and can be quite a steal in terms of price.

 Rain shoes ? flip flops, transparent sandals, rubber shoes or the age-old gum boots ? are the ideal gear to keep your feet in shape while on the move amid the slush. 

 Practical shoes are a must during the rains, insists Ghosh. And here, too, keep the accent on bold colours, not pastel shades.

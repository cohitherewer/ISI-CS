 Portrait of arty, crafty 

con man

 A STAFF REPORTER

 All that glitters may not be gold. The chances are that it may be more valuable than gold. Some con artists are seized of this simple truth. Kaushik Sen, who was arrested by Bhowanipore police on Monday, was one of them. He was not only crafty. He was arty too.

 Though he ended up in custody on charges of depriving jewellery shops of ornaments worth Rs 3 lakh by playing confidence tricks on them, the mild-mannered physiotherapist in his 30s, who lives in Mandeville Gardens, seems to be quite a connoisseur as well.

 In his eventful career, he has succeeded in cheating some leading Bengal painters or their kin and art dealers as well, of valuable art work.

 Over the last half of 2004, Sen had conned the likes of artists Shuvaprasanna, Shanu Lahiri, Parbati Bhattacharjee, wife of the ailing Bikash Bhattacharjee, and Naveen Kishore of Seagull.

 Consummate actor that he was, Sen never felt the need to fake his address and telephone number. 

 He would worm himself into the confidence of prospective victims by telling a sob story of an ailing relative, who desperately needed either cash for treatment or a certain work by an artist to bring him or her peace of mind.

 Or else, he would pretend to be a doctor with a bedside manner who could bring relief to an ailing artist. And though it is now being made out that Sen is in need of psychiatric treatment, the man had sense enough to negotiate with underhand dealers, who have no qualms about handling works of uncertain provenance. Thereby, paintings have disappeared without trace.

 Parbati Bhattacharjee, for instance, had given Sen a watercolour by her husband last December, and though she wants it back now, it seems to have landed somewhere in Delhi, via a gallery in Southern Avenue. 

 She went to the police after the cheque for Rs 2 lakh she had received from Sen bounced thrice. A police officer extracted a promise from Sen that he would not repeat his act, and later Sen paid her only Rs 85,000 in two instalments. But that was the last she saw of both painting and cheque.

 When he approached Shuvaprasanna for a painting, Sen turned into neurosurgeon who was so polite and interested in art that the artist was floored and gave him a work for Rs 25,000. 

 Again the cheque bounced several times, and the artist got his due only after Lalbazar intervened. The police were already in the know about the man?s activities.

 Sen had tried his trick on Shanu Lahiri ? and succeeded ? by dropping names.

 Again with police help, and in the presence of Sen?s father, she has recovered some of her money but not her work.

 Naveen Kishore has filed a case against this con artist after his cheque for Rs 1.5 lakh for a K.G. Subramanyan bounced several times. Sen had done the same with another art dealer, but she went to police on time and did not regret it.

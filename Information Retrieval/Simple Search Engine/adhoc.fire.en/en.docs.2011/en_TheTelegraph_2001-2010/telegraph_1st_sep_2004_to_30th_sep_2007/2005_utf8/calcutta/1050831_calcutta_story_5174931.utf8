The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Ply new auto or scrap it

 - Fit LPG kits only to four-stroke engines, says fresh order

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 State transport department officials made it clear on Tuesday that retro-fitting autorickshaws with LPG kits would not be allowed, unless the vehicles have four-stroke engines.

 According to an order by the department, only three-wheelers compliant with Bharat Stage (BS) II mass emission standards would be allowed on roads after December 31. 

 Unlike in the case of other vehicles, no distinction will be made between three-wheelers of pre-1990 make and newer models.

 About 55,000 autos ply in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area (CMA) alone. About 300 of them have already been retro-fitted with LPG kits to meet the BS II standards.

 ?As per the government order and Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) norms, all autos, irrespective of age and make, will have to be replaced with BS II-compliant models,?? asserted public vehicles department (PVD) director H. Mohan.

 According to ARAI guidelines, a BS II-compliant auto has a four-stroke engine and factory-fitted LPG kit. The ARAI is the central authority on specifications of automobile engines.

 An auto with two-stroke engine, retro-fitted with an LPG kit, does not meet the BS II standards. Mohan felt that some operators were creating confusion in this regard.

 PVD assistant director (registration) Manab Chakraborty stated that almost all the three-wheelers plying in the CMA have two-stroke engines, and hence, there is no scope for the operators to make the vehicles BS II-compliant by retro-fitting LPG kits.

 The only option is to replace the vehicles with BS II-compliant models.

 Chakraborty stressed that the permits of operators with retro-fitted LPG kits and two-stroke engines would not be renewed.

 Only 700 autos plying in the CMA are BS II-compliant ? 400 old vehicles have been replaced with new ones, the rest are new.

 ?Most operators will not be able to shell out over a lakh of rupees to buy new vehicles. If the government does not help us by arranging bank loans, thousands of youths will be unemployed,?? pointed out Anadi Shaw, general secretary of the Citu-controlled West Bengal Autorickshaw Operators? Union.

 Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty has already turned down a plea by operators to allow plying of three-wheelers that meet tail-pipe emission norms.

When Sanjay Dutt and Ajay Devgan are fast giving Preity 

Zinta and Kareena Kapoor competition when it comes to hair effect, can their fans 

be far behind? Indeed, hair colouring now is as big for men as it is for women. 

Age no bar, men are letting their hair down, quite literally. 

From hair colouring to conditioning and blow drying, 

the Adams of Calcutta are frequenting hair salons as frequently as Eves. 

After Shahid Afridi who got his hair coloured at Eye 

Catchers, a salon on Wood Street, a few months ago, we caught popular city DJ 

Girish as he went in for a hair makeover with the in colours of the season ? blonde 

and walnut ? giving him a look that?s truly trendy.

Goodlife does a check on the hair colours and 

streaking styles popular with men.

Trendy tresses

?The colours that are doing well with men now are 

blonde, walnut, almond and copper,? says Reshma, senior hair stylist at Eye Catchers, 

who also coloured Afridi?s hair when he was in Calcutta last.

While blonde is right for those with a light complexion, 

copper and walnut are meant for those with wheatish skin tones. Those on the darker 

side of the scale should go for almond. ?It?s not as if a darker person can?t 

flaunt copper or even a blonde hair colour, but the effect is best if one sticks 

to hues that are bound to suit a particular skin shade,? adds Reshma.

Streaking styles

Both for guys and girls, the options are either to 

go for global hair colouring or streaking and highlighting. Women often go for 

slicing (colouring a thick band of hair in a particular shade) but men should 

avoid that look, feel hair stylists. 

?For the younger lot, highlighting with two or more 

colours is the in thing. It makes the hair look trendy,? adds Reshma. The older 

brigade could go for global colouring (using just one colour for the entire hair), 

unless they want to be adventurous and try something different. 

?In case of Girish, I have used walnut and blonde 

and highlighted the front part of the hair. The inner layers at the back have 

been given a global colouring while the outer layer is left black with little 

streaking. This gives the effect of the ends being coloured when the inner coloured 

layer peeps out,? she explains. 

Mane maintenance 

With busy days and hectic travel schedules, men hardly 

ever find the time to look after their hair. The trick is to find an easy but 

regular hair regimen that will ensure the locks remain healthy and the colour 

lasts. 

?One major reason for getting dandruff is irregular 

shampooing. Therefore, using a shampoo and a conditioner is imperative to maintain 

the health of coloured hair,? says Reshma. 

Usually it is safe to use a new colour after every 

three months. More frequent changes tend to dry out the strands. Using a colour 

guard shampoo also helps. ?Effort needed for maintenance differs from colour to 

colour. Thus the more funky shades like red and orange tend to fade out faster 

than subtle hues like walnut and almond,? points out Reshma.

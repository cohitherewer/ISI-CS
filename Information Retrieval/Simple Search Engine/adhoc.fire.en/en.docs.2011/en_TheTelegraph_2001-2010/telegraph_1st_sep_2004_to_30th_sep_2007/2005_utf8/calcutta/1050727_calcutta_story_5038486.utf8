 Buck pass at crime meet

 - Salt Lake councillors say cops inert, police cite VIP pressure

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Are some residents responsible for the spurt in crime in Salt Lake?

 North 24-Parganas police superintendent Praveen Kumar hinted at the possibility on Tuesday, when he told the chairman and CPM councillors of Bidhannagar Municipality that a section of influential residents of Salt Lake often forced police to let off suspected criminals picked up from the township.

 ?After arresting suspects, we often gets calls from VIP residents requesting us to release them. They say they know the suspects and accuse us of harassing innocent people,? a councillor quoted Kumar as having told chairman Biswajiban Majumdar. Both Kumar and Majumdar, however, refused comment.

 The meeting was held in the wake of a nightlong rampage by a gang of robbers, who also raped a teenager in front of her parents, on Sunday.

 The councillors claimed having told Kumar that police were not active enough in Salt Lake and were not conducting raids on buildings under construction. Criminals often take shelter in such buildings in the guise of labourers.

 Police had earlier ordered that labourers, drivers or other workers coming into Salt Lake carry an identity card. Those not carrying the card would be picked up. ?But the raids have recently been stopped,? one of the councillors told Kumar.

 The police superintendent then argued how their hands were tied by ?VIP residents?.

 According to another councillor, Kumar admitted that vigil had slackened after the June 19 civic elections. ?But he assured us that the force would pull up its socks,? the councillor told Metro.

 Both stressed the need for better coordination between police and the municipality.

 Sources said a ?high-level? meeting would be held on Wednesday to work out how policing in the township could be made more effective.

 Rabiul Laskar, the fourth accused in Sunday?s rape-and-robbery, was remanded in judicial custody for 14 days by the Bidhannagar sub-divisional judicial magistrate?s court on Monday. 

 Laskar was arrested in Patharpratima, South 24-Parganas. Police have appealed for an identification parade and fingerprint tests for the accused. 

 Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee, who addressed a ?protest rally? in Salt Lake on Tuesday, threatened to file a PIL in the high court if the government did not order a CBI probe into the robbery within 48 hours. She also demanded imposition of Article 355 in the state.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Talks on for LPG autos

 A STAFF REPORTER

 State transport minister Subhas Chakraborty is in talks with the autorickshaw-manufacturing unit of Bajaj Automobiles for supply of LPG-fitted vehicles, said officials of his department on Sunday. 

 The talks could hold the key to the conversion of autorickshaws to LPG (liquefied petroleum gas). August 31 was the deadline for the phase-out of polluting vehicles. It was extended recently.

 ?The minister met representatives of Bajaj in the recent past. Another meeting is in the pipeline. Until the issue of supply of new LPG autorickshaws is sorted out, we cannot crack down on the polluting ones,? pointed out a senior official of the department on Sunday.

 Citu state secretary Mrinal Das stated: ?Since the government has not been able to provide infrastructure for the changeover, around 15 days ago, we asked the minister for an extension of the deadline. He agreed.?

 He added that about 700 of the 25,000-odd licensed autorickshaws in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area run on the green fuel. 

 ?Most of these vehicles are new. There have been few conversions since the government is yet to work out a finance scheme,? Das explained.

 As per estimates, 38,000 autorickshaws ply in the city. Over 6,800 are pre-1990 make and were due to phased out at the end of the month. The deadline for other commercial vehicles is December 31.

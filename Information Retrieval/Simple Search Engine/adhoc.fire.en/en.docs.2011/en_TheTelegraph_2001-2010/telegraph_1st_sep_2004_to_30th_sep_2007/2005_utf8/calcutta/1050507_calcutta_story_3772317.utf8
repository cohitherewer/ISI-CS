 Peshwa power

 If different cuisines interest you, theres Maharashtrian fare on offer at the Indian speciality restaurant Sonargaon in Taj Bengal. Specifically, the taste has been culled from the royal Peshwas of Pune.

 One can start off with Aluchi Wadi (arbi leaves and gram flour rolled, steamed and fried), Komdi Patra (marinated chicken steamed and fried) and more.

 Moving on to the main course, one can choose from Konkan specialities. Seafood, poultry and meat feature prominently in this section. Jhinga Peshwai (prawns cooked in roasted coconut and onion gravy) and Machhli Rassa (Pomfret cooked in a roasted coconut and onion gravy) are a few examples. Those who prefer Kolhapuri dishes can opt for the Komdi Rassa (country-style chicken curry), Sukha Komdi (marinated chicken cooked with spices and coconut) or Mutton Kolhapuri (spicy lamb curry). 

 Vegetarians have plenty to choose from with items like Methi Wada Batata Rassa (fenugreek dumplings and potato cooked in tomato gravy), Cauliflower Tamatar Rassa and the like.

 The dishes are best sampled with staples like Masala Bhat, Alu Bhat, Komdi Chi Khichdi (rice with chicken) and millet bread or Jawari Chi Bhakri. 

 To complete the meal, an assortment of Maharashtrian desserts are on offer, like Puran Poli (whole wheat bread stuffed with jaggery and lentils), Shrikhand (sweetened yoghurt) and lots more.

 Grey spectrum

 Black amp; White is the theme for an exhibition of khadi, applique, kantha, ikkat and block prints on saris, fabrics, dupattas and scarves at Weavers Studio on Anil Moitra Street. 

 Design studio Avni has come up with a collection of ready-to-wear garments embellished with zardosi, applique and pigment prints, while Bandhej has brought some interesting tie-and-dye cotton kurtas from Gujarat, and Dastkar has some khadi textures using natural dyes on display. 

 The black and white palette seeps further into Maheshwari Textiles that has displayed prints with natural and chemical dyes, while Woman Weave has exhibited an ethnic range comprising Kota, Maheshwari and Chanderi fabrics. Block-printed and embroidered tussar silk saris with subtle embroidery and rippled textures add a classic touch to the Bodhi line. 

 The exhibition also throws up net and gauze fabrics in the Kraftia collection. Neeru Kumars handwoven saris in khadi covering a wide range of styles are also worth a look. The exhibition ends on Saturday.

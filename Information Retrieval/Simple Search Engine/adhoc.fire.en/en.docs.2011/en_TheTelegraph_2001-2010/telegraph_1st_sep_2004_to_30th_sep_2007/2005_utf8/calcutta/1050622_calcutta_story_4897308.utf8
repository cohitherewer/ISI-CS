 English cry in HS helpline

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 English remains the anathema of a large section of students who appear in the Higher Secondary (HS) exams. But the overall scenario is not so bad this year as to make candidates take extreme steps.

 More than a fortnight after the results have been declared, the experience is similar with both a tele-counselling facility offered by a city based non-government organisation (NGO) and a helpline set up by the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education. 

 The calls received are mostly from failures in English. And for most of them, it is the only subject which has caused them to trip.

 ?Nearly 30 per cent of the calls that we have received during the past two weeks were from candidates who failed twice in the examination only for being unable to clear the English papers,? said Sramana Dasgupta, psychologist of the NGO Society for Nature Education and Health (Sneh). 

 The organisation plans to approach the HS council and seek appropriate measures to improve the English teaching standards in schools.

 This year, nearly 33 per cent of the students have failed in HS. ?We are working on a plan to find out the exact number of failures in English this year,? Debashis Sarkar, council secretary, said. 

 The HS Council had claimed that the overall performance of students in English this year was ?satisfactory?. Though Sarkar did not budge from the stand, he said that the Council was trying to work out measures to ensure that the failures in English are reduced further in the coming years.

 The number of ?distress? calls, though, has been virtually nil this year. 

 ?We had received nearly 1,000 calls from the city on the first two days after the announcement of the results. But none among the callers ? mostly parents ? complained of incidents like examinees running away from home or locking themselves in their rooms for not getting expected marks,? Dasgupta of Sneh said. 

 ?Last year, we had received a good number of distressed calls from anxious parents whose sons or daughters had passed but left home for not getting expected marks. This trend is encouraging,? Dasgupta said.

 The council officials too said that this time, no parents had complained that their ward was suffering from severe depression or had left home. Instead, the calls were only from those who have failed in the examinations. 

 ?Guardians and students were more keen this time to ensure that their wards repeated the examinations in 2006,? an official added.

 DJ Clement was called in from Mumbai to make the ladies and their companions dance to his tune on Saturday at B.E.D. (Bars, Entertainment and Dining).

 The theme of the ladies special night this week round was white and blue. So, while the women sported these colours on their clothes, the bar at the Ballygunge Circular Road address decided to do its bit by churning out glasses of exotic mocktails and shooters of the same colour combination.

 Once in a while its nice to make the girls dance to your tune, laughed the DJ who hails from Bangalore.

 The music was out-and-out Bollywood, with a good melange of latest hits and remixes.

 Natural glow

 With the humidity levels shooting up with the dampness of the rain, your skin tends to get dull during the monsoon, and is in constant need of regeneration. Sudhas Beauty Parlour at Hotel Hindusthan International claims to have the ideal solution to get rid of the problems that plague the season.

 Lambency of the Svil Group has come up with a range of products that use sandalwood as a base to cleanse and purify the skin. The company, according to the salon, is the worlds largest manufacturer of pure sandalwood oil.

 Natural products are always the most long-lasting solutions for the skin. There is a constant need to counteract seasonal fluctuations, explains Sudha Bibra, leading beauty therapist and consultant.

 The Sandalwood Face Treatment, her latest beauty innovation, is suitable for a number of skin types, including the mature, young and acne-prone.

 It firms the mature skin, allowing cells to regenerate and brings a youthful glow instantly. Whats more, its cool, astringent properties are ideal for curing all kinds of skin problems, especially acne, she adds.

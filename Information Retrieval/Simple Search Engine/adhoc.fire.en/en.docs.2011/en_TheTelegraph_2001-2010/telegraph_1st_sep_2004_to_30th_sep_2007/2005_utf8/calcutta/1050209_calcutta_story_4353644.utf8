Laces and lycra for nights in

From flowing gowns in silks and satins 

to cute capris and tanks tops the options in sleep wear are extensive and 

exciting. Ipsita Deb tracks the trends

From crisp cottons and stretchable lycra to flowing 

satins, silks and yards of laces ? going to bed can be quite a stylish affair 

with the options in sleep wear getting wider by the day. Whether you prefer wearing 

a cute tee with three-quarter drawstring pants at night or a sexy gown is more 

your style, you will definitely be spoilt for choice at stores around town.

?Sleep wear couture is a booming market in India today 

and follows international trends. While the in fabric is georgette, having left 

the satins of last year behind, in terms of style, the shorter the better. Laces, 

shimmering nets and other sheer, flowy and comfortable fabrics are also in. The 

hot colours are neons and brighter shades of pink, yellow, peach and orange,? 

explains sleep wear designer Suman Nathwani of La Lingerie. 

She further informs that black is ?done and out? when 

it comes to night wear. Embroidery, too, is out as floral prints are back with 

a bang. Lots of frills and trimmings still rule. 

Designer and proprietor of Necessity boutique, Swati 

Gautam, stresses on the comfort factor. ?People are becoming more and more liberal 

about what they wear to bed, but the comfort factor still rules while deciding 

night gear,? she feels.

Nathwani agrees: ?It?s all about a person?s individual 

style and what she is comfortable with. The experimental can opt for short hot 

pants or mid-thigh slips, while the more cautious could stick to two-piece negligee 

and gown, pyjama suits or kaftans.?

Goodlife scans the stores to hunt out the varieties 

on offer. 

Sexy sheen

Light and flowy fabrics like silk, georgette, chiffon, 

stretch lace and shimmery polyester are good bets if you want to project oodles 

of sex appeal. These are pop picks for trousseaus and are mostly picked up by 

brides-to-be and newly-weds, inform shop owners.

The styles can vary depending on your need to be anything 

from elegant to romantic or downright sexy in bed. The favourites in this segment 

are night gowns with matching wraps or kimonos. The gowns can have slits in front 

or the sides, low criss-cross backs, spaghetti straps, halter-necks or plunging 

necklines. The embellishments come in the form of lace trimmings, ruffles, rosettes, 

beading and embroidery.

The colours range between pastels and vibrant ? from 

pink, lavender, sea-foam, blue and yellow to hot pink, poppy, orange and turquoise. 

With prints doing the rounds, zebra, leopard and python patterns are the new entrants. 

For the more feminine kinds, mosaic, paisley, Chinese floral and tie-and-dye are 

the options. The usual polka dots, checks and stripes can also be found on the 

racks. 

 Available at: Sleep-ins (Shakespeare Sarani 

and City Centre), La Lingerie (Forum and Victoria Plaza) and Necessity (Hindusthan 

Park).

 Price point: Starting from Rs 700.

Casual chic

If flaunting feminine flounces is not your style, 

opt for some cool casuals instead. These are high on the comfort quotient, yet 

look very trendy and chic. You can either sport a tank top with capris or team 

camisole tops and mini-robes with three-quarter pants. 

In fact, these two-piece or three-piece sets pair 

camisoles, sleeveless tops, spaghettis, full sleeve tops or easy-button blouses 

with boxer shorts, drawstring shorts, capris, full-length pants and pyjamas. Satin 

sleep pants and mix-and-match tank tops are also quite big.

The fabrics in this category are mostly cotton and 

cashmere blended with lycra, polyester and nylon. These are comfortable, wrinkle-resistant 

and have the wash-and-go advantage. 

 Available at: Westside, Pantaloons, Shoppers? 

Stop, Sleep-ins and La Lingerie.

 Price point: Rs 300 onwards.

 Bard at home away from home

 Shenandoah Shakespeare stages Much Ado About Nothing

 Shakespeare may have missed the birth of America, but the home of the Bard?s first masterpieces has been reborn across the Atlantic.

 The Blackfriars Playhouse is nestled in quaint Staunton Virginia. It is the first-ever recreation of Richard Burbage?s theatre, the venue where Shakespeare?s plays were staged ? and where he even took the stage himself for Every Man and his Humour ? before he changed allegiance to Globe.

 Shenandoah Shakespeare, which had been touring with productions of Shakespeare?s works since the 1980s, completed the Blackfriars project in 2001 and is now planning a recreation of Globe?s 1614 post-fire avatar just a short walk away.

 All this while keeping ticket prices between $ 22 and $ 30, a fraction of the rate charged by most Broadway shows, which has been made possible by patronage of lovers of the arts, much like the Bard himself in his time.

 Four hundred years later, however, the Queen of England has had little to do with Blackfriars success, though Dame Judi Dench (who, notably, played Queen Elizabeth in Shakespeare in Love ) does her bit to support it, even serving on its board.

 While the playhouse hosts visiting groups, the regular dramatis personae is Shenandoah Shakespeare?s energetic resident troupe. Its recent productions include works by Shakespeare and other writers ? Hamlet to She Stoops to Conquer, All?s Well That End?s Well to an original adaptation of The Three Musketeers.

 If Shenandoah Shakespeare?s puckish sense of fun makes plays like She Stoops? and The Three Musketeers light, airy, laugh-out-loud entertainment, it receives a generous dollop of support from the venue itself. The colonial architecture of historic downtown Staunton provides the perfect foil for this modest structure, with humble portals transporting visitors four centuries back to Elizabethan England.

 Two-tiered seating surrounds the stage on three sides, with chairs lining the dais as well (there are no wings to the left and right of the stage, all exists and entries are made from the rear).

 The stage is largely bare, with sets and props kept to a minimum. By leaving the houselights (candelabra with bulbs) on through the action as Shakespeare would have, the actors cannot only see the audience, they are free to interact with it ? to dramatic effect. 

 Visitors are made co-conspirators, with loud asides and much eye contact. They swing into the crowd as shots are fired over the shoulder of unsuspecting viewers. The labyrinth of wooden benches and banisters becomes an extension of the stage as battleground or getaway route.

 A significant departure from the Shakespearean norm (American accents aside) has been the company?s gender-inclusive policy. But while women are welcome and appear in plenty, the cross-dressing culture is still thriving here, with men frequently dressing like women for a quick comic value-add. They, however, abide by the norm of old, with costumes reflecting the fashions of Shakespeare?s age and not of the period in which the play is set. The recreated Blackfriars is the scene of some true swashbuckling entertainment. Here, on home turf, the Bard is real and everyday, far removed from the intellectual exercise his work often becomes.

 All that is missing is rowdy rabble chucking rotten tomatoes when the plot takes an unhappy turn. To ensure the pace never flags even during intermission, the players will sing a ditty or two in praise of Bacchus flowing (not freely but cheap enough) in the foyer. 

 Yes, to add to the night-at-the-movies kind of ambience (this is after all, the 16th century take on INOX), you are allowed to eat, drink and be merry to your happy heart?s content.

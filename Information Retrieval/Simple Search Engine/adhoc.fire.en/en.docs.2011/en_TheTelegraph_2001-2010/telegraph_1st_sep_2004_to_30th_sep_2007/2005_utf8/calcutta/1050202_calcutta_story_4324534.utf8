 Tribute to the benefits of science

 Natural sources of power, like nuclear, wind, solar and water, organic farming, the secrets of DNA and genes, waste management, recycling, pollution prevention? the good sides of science. Who better to demonstrate this than young minds just beginning to understand its beauty?

 A visit to the Eastern India Science Fair and Engineering Fair 2005 at Birla Industrial and Technological Museum (BITM) will prove there?s much more to the subject than meets the eye.

 ?Without science, we cannot exist,? announced Rabi Narayan Nanda, science and technology and water resources minister of Orissa at the inauguration of the fair. 

 He was echoing the sentiments of West Bengal education minister Kanti Biswas, who said the amount of money from the country?s GDP spent on scientific research and development was ?far below the global average?. 

 The five-day fair, organised under the aegis of the National Council of Museums, is a tribute to the benefits of the science and the importance of inculcating its values in youngsters. 

 About 290 students and 70 teachers from 120 schools and science clubs from 10 states in eastern India have put 165 projects on display at the fair. The engineering segment is represented by 64 students from 14 colleges with 25 models.

 Some of the projects are based on basic scientific principles, others are innovations and simple inventions to make life better and easier. 

 A few are unique in nature, like the mosquito trap at the Manipur stall. This state has a few more special offerings, like the earthquake alarm. 

 There?s an automatic utensils washing machine and an enhanced bullock cart. 

 Barsa from Bihar has come up with a project explaining the implications of genetics in farming. Chris from Nagaland has harnessed wind to generate power in a contraption made from scrap material. Totan from Jagatpur Rukmini Vidyamandir has stuffed waste plastic bags in upholstery to make a sofa. 

 Nikhilesh and Debanjan of Maharishi Vidyamandir in Assam have found natural, hassle-free ways to clean up oil spills in water. Their car service station uses sawdust to soak up the oil from water, which can then be reused. The oily sawdust, they prove, is a better source of fuel than plain sawdust.

 Nang Tado and Rinzing from Mangan Senior Secondary School in Sikkim have used water in a number of their working models on display, from a purifier to a power generator. And there?s a cost-free, three-filter bamboo pipe to filter water for ?poor people in hilly areas?. 

 Among the engineering students, a project shows how to get biodiesel from vegetable oils, while Biplab from Darjeeling has put together a two-seater cycle from bicycle and rickshaw parts.

 The other states have been through the district-level selections. West Bengal?s students will be judged at the fair. There are three prizes, for best individual and team project and for best state, which will be given on Saturday.

 A woman wronged

 Throughout history, women have led lives in which they have been granted little importance or value by society or even appreciated by their near and dear ones. Their needs and desires have been wilfully ignored and overlooked, their words and ideas given scant attention. They have been not been allowed any means of self-expression or to lead meaningful lives. Urmila Upakhyan borrows a few lesser-known episodes from the Ramayana to highlight social pressures on women and the subjugation, dishonour and indignity that they endure all their lives. The play depicts Urmila compelled to bow to social norms and lead a life of abject misery, although fully aware of the injustice being meted out to her. She leads a lonely, forsaken life, neglected by her husband Lakshman, who follows Rama and Sita to Dandakaranya, disregarding the fact that his wife is carrying their child. Later, when Urmila clearly sees through the politically motivated ploys of Kaikayee and Manthara, she raises her voice in protest, only to be imprisoned. Slighted by society, as by her husband, she remains forever, the archetypal figure of the wronged woman. Direction: Rishi Mukherjee.

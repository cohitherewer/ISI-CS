 Doctor in mystery lost and found

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Mystery shrouds the disappearance of a junior doctor from the RG Kar Medical College and Hospital premises on Monday night and his reappearance on Tuesday morning at Balasore railway station in Orissa.

 Arindom Sen, the 25-year-old intern, was scheduled to be on night duty at the gynaecology ward of the hospital on Monday.

 His mother Anima Sen, head of the chemistry department at Rajabazar Science College, lodged a missing complaint at Tallah police station early on Tuesday, after a frantic search at the hospital proved futile.

 According to the hospital authorities, Arindom did not turn up for work on Monday night. Police are yet to find leads about his disappearance.

 ?A complaint was lodged with us, but the doctor himself called home within hours. We will talk to him once he is brought back to the city. We can?t say anything about the case at this point,? said Damayanti Sen, deputy commissioner (north). 

 Arindom left his residence, at 138/A, Raja Rammohun Roy Sarani (Amherst Street), under Muchipara police station, around 6.30 pm on Monday and headed for RG Kar in his family car. He reached the gynaecology building half-an-hour later. A few of his colleagues saw him entering the hospital.

 ?Arindom usually calls home from his mobile after reaching the hospital. But he did not call us on Monday. We became anxious when we failed to reach him on his mobile or on the hospital phone. His cell phone was switched off. We went to the hospital around 1.30 am and discovered that he was not there. By then, we were frantic,? recounted Tanima Modok, Arindom?s maternal aunt. The relatives then decided to lodge a complaint.

 Tanima added: ?Arindom called to say that he was on a platform in Balasore station and had no idea how he got there. His tiffin box, cell phone and money were gone.?

 Following the call, Anima contacted a relative in Balasore and asked him to get to the station in a hurry.

 The family members failed to shed light on the disappearance, but said they had recently received some threats, possibly in connection with a property dispute.

 Lost in Puja crowd surge

 A STAFF REPORTER

 At least seven children ? between one and 12 years ? who had gone missing during the Pujas are yet to be traced. Of those above 12 who disappeared from the festive crowds, at least 19 have not returned.

 ?Going by the records, 15 kids in the one-to-12 age-group went missing on the festive days. We could trace eight and reunite them with their families, and are trying our best to find the rest,? said a senior officer of the missing persons squad of the city police.

 While most were reported missing from pandals, a few lost their way in areas close to their homes. Some of them had come from adjoining districts.

 Ten-year-old Pinki Sarkar, a resident of Picnic Garden, went out with her parents on Ashtami. According to her father Santosh, she was with him at Triangular Park till around 7.30 pm, struggling to catch a glimpse of the Devi. Then came a sudden wave from behind and the girl slipped out of her father?s grip. She is yet to be traced.

 Tumpa Manna, 15, is another victim of surging revelry. The girl had come from Bakshi, in Howrah, to her mamarbari in Jorabagan to see Calcutta pujas, which she had never seen before.

 Around 8 pm on October 10, while waiting outside a puja pandal, Tumpa?s relatives lost sight of her. After waiting in vain for four days, her brother Raju turned up at the police headquarters in Lalbazar on Friday, carrying a photograph of Tumpa and pleading with officers to find her. 

 ?As most of the officers are busy with immersion, we are yet to collate information pouring in from all 48 police stations in the city. The number of missing could well go up. It?s only after the Puja duty that we can sit down and probe every single case,? said an officer of the detective department, overseeing the missing persons squad.

 Insiders, however, are not too hopeful. Police records reveal that around 1,000 persons go missing from the city every year. More than half of them never return.

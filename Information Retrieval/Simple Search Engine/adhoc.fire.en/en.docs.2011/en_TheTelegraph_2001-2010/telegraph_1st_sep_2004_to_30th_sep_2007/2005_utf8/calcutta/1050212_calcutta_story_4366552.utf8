 Valentine?s Day is more about mush and less about cash. The path to the high point of romance is paved by diamonds and strewn with roses. The footfall down the garden path ? via small stores and shopping malls ? has never been higher. Yet, business generated on V-Day eve is significantly less than traditional occasions, like Dhanteras or Durga puja, weddings or Christmas.

 The product basket is bigger than before, as the need to say the three famous words with flowers or chocolates, soft toys or diamonds, grows every February.

 ?Valentine?s Day generates the largest footfall, even more than Dhanteras. We get at least a hundred new customers every day, per outlet, during this season,? says Anargha Chowdhury, director Anjali Jewellers. ?Since the value of the Valentine?s Day specials is very little, the revenue generated is much lower compared to other more traditional festivals.?

 The lowering of the entry barrier has broadened the customer base quite dramatically ? from students with an eye on pocket money to budget buyers.

 ?The footfalls go up dramatically during Valentine?s week, but most are college students counting their pocket money to gift a little bit of jewellery,? adds Meenakshi Modi, director of Diagold, City Centre.

 Even when saying it with flowers, ?the demand ranges from a single stem of rose to a whole room or car of flowers?, but it?s ?more a festival of emotions? than splurge, says Indira Agarwal of Ferns and Petals, on Loudon Street. ?The age-bracket is generally 18-plus, wanting to gift one flower arrangement each from February 11 till Valentine?s Day.?

 Emotion is the key, stresses marketing consultant Shiloo Chattopadhyay. ?Emotional needs drive the market, especially during Valentine?s Day. The day this becomes more Indianised, the market will grow much bigger,? he adds.

 For now, the ?quantity of sale during Valentine?s Day is very low compared to sales in Diwali or Christmas?, for sweet somethings at Candy Treats, confirms Manjari Tibrewal.

 At Landmark, too, for all the rush, Valentine?s Day revenue figures rate well below Christmas and Diwali. ?Most consumers are hardly out of college, so their spending power is limited,? says Gautam Jatia of Landmark.

 At Nik Nish in Metro Plaza, big discounts are the bait for young buyers and small spenders. ?Stuffed toys and junk jewellery are in good demand,? says Jigar Patel.

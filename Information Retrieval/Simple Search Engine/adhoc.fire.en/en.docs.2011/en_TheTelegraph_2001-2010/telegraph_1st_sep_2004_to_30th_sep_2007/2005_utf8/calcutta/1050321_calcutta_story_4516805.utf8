 Trident aim of medicare seminar 

 SUBHRO SAHA

 The sixth annual conference of the Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy of India, Endocon 2005, to be held in Calcutta (March 27 to 29), will see a galaxy of international and Indian luminaries in the field sharing their knowledge of contemporary techniques and best practices.

 The three-day summit organised by the Gastroenterology Education Society will feature 30-35 procedures as part of the workshop to be held on the premises of Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, which will be transmitted live through fibre-optic cables to Hyatt Regency, the venue of the conference.

 ?The organising committee has charted out a well-thought-out and exciting academic programme with lead talks, debates and symposia, besides live demonstration of techniques,? declares Mahesh Goenka, head, Institute of Gastroenterology, Apollo Gleneagles, and organising secretary of the conference.

 The aim of the seminar is three-pronged ? to exercise control over choosing patients for endoscopy, reduce risk of infection during procedures and use of advanced technology for better results. 

 A voting pad system will make the sessions lively and interactive, feel the organisers, who expect around 500 participants, including faculty, from top international institutes.

 Among the new techniques and equipment to be demonstrated at the workshop are shape-lock for smooth colonoscopy, endoscopic cryotherapy (treating of bleeding lesions by application of cold), new winged stents, widespread endoscopic mucosal resection and new accessories.

 Apart from presentations by national and international experts, there is a ?Meet the Professor? breakfast window for personalised discussion on the last two days. Some of the standout session conductors at the breakfast show will be Nib Soehendra from the University Hospital of Hamburg, Paul Swain from London University and Gregory B. Haber from Lenox Hill Hospital, USA.

 ?A lot of stress will be given on precautions to avoid infection and the conference will seek to formulate a uniform set of guidelines to be practised here,? Goenka points out. A symposium on the opening day will address ?endoscopic disinfection?. The lead talk will be on endoscopic recycling, disinfection and accessory reusability, with a panel discussion on the Indian scenario.

 The entire proceedings at the three-day seminar will be recorded on a CDROM and distributed to doctors all over the country. A learning centre for endoscopic techniques will enable doctors to view all the procedures and take critical notes.

 The organisers have also arranged for 23 young doctors to show their original scientific work. Twenty such chapters have been collected and will be published as a book during the summit.

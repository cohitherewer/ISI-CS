The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Convict shifted to hospital

 - Shoe baron kidnap link was on fast to seek speedy justice

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Police were in a tizzy after Happy Singh, a criminal with international links, and two accomplices were shifted to Bangur hospital from Alipore Central jail after Saturday midnight. 

 Happy was arrested in connection with the abduction in 2002 of city-based shoe magnate Parthapratim Roy Burman. 

 On a hunger strike since January 19 to press their demand for a speedy trial, the trio?s condition apparently deteriorated on Saturday.

 Police made arrangements to ensure that Happy did not give them the slip. ?A tight security ring has been thrown in and around the hospital in Tollygunge, where the three are under treatment,? said an officer of Jadavpur police station.

 The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has lost its sleep over this development. ?We are not convinced. After all, Happy had unsuccessfully tried to break out of jail last year. A mobile phone and a letter with an escape route were found in his cell.?

 Superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas) S.N. Gupta, too, expressed his concern, saying: ?We are not taking any chances.? 

 Joydeb Chakraborty, inspector-general of police (prisons), said Happy and five other accused went on a fast from January 19, initially demanding speedy trial and disposal of their case. They also sought a meeting with any judge, either of the high court or of the Supreme Court.

 As the jail authorities refused to concede to their ?absurd? demands, their fast continued. ?It was around 11 pm when Happy and two others, Bijoy Sarder and Asif Ali, fell ill. They were rushed to hospital. Now, they are under observation,? said a jail official.

 An official of Alipore Central jail said: ?They were suffering from acute dehydration and stomach ache. Even after hospitalisation, Singh?s fasting accomplices, Abdul Rehman, Abdul Khaleq and Shaukat Ali, refused food and water. So they were force-fed and are better now.?

 The jail authorities asked the doctors to produce a detailed report on their condition to ascertain that they were not faking illness.

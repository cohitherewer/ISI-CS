 Smokescreen on dengue

 - Big fogging machines can be lethal for humans, say experts

 OUR BUREAU

Last week, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation intensified its war against the dengue-causing Aedes mosquitoes by introducing van fog machines to spray toxic insecticides in roads around the city. 

 But far from killing the mosquitoes, it has only helped the disease spread further and leave more people ill, say medical experts.

 On Sunday, the total number of dengue afflicted was up by 97 since Saturday and stood at 1,711 in the city and elsewhere in the state. The death toll stayed 18.

 City-based virologists and entomologists warn that the toxic ingredient of the chemicals (organo-phosphorus compounds) used in the sprays that cause dense smoke to engulf an area harms human beings.

 In the past few days, many patients have turned up at the School of Tropical Medicine (STM) with severe breathing problems after inhaling the pungent gas in the Bhowanipore area two days ago. 

 ?We had to admit an asthma patient to our hospital after he developed severe breathing problems,? disclosed a senior virologist at STM, who himself had developed a severe headache after inhaling the gas.

 ?The airways of human beings, especially those of asthma patients, are irritable to any kind of obnoxious stimulus. It is quite possible that if an asthma patient is exposed to smoke from the van fog machine, it can turn out to be lethal,? said respiratory disease expert Ashok Sengupta. 

 ?It is like spraying nerve gas. Virologists are of the opinion that spraying gas in neighbourhoods means driving the mosquitoes into homes, and also driving them from one area to another. Studies say these gases have a drastic effect on the lungs,? adds cancer surgeon Gautam Mukhopadhyay. 

 Prabhakar Chatterjee, director of health services, said that on Monday he would seek a report on how insecticides are being sprayed. ?We want to kill mosquitoes, not harm people. I will check out the details tomorrow,? he added. 

 A January 21, 2000, circular from the Union health ministry (order no 4-6/97-98NMEP?ST Fogging Mal) clearly states that in case of a dengue and malaria outbreak, the epicentre of the outbreak, possibly the first house where the disease started, has to be identified. 

 Thereafter, the house must be fumigated, followed by 50 more houses in the neighbourhood, but with portable fogging machines, and not the big ones used now.

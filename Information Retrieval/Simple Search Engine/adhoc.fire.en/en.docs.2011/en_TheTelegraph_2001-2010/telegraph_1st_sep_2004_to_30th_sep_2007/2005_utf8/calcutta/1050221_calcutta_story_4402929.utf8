 Mihir Maity: Brilliant students no longer choose research in basic sciences as their career. The boring theoretical details that are taught in classrooms are putting them off science altogether. Are you doing anything to arrest the trend?

 It is true that the portrayal of basic sciences as boring subjects laden with theoretical details is pushing students away from science. There is also a notion that the study of basic sciences is not conducive to earning handsome salaries. While we stress the need for technology through the models displayed in our museum, we also try to explain the scientific phenomena at work behind the applications. We regularly hold demonstration lectures to inform students of the basic principles. Demonstration classes will be held during the summer and winter vacations.

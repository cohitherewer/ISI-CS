The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 No-sale tag to shut out promoters

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The state government?s announcement on Tuesday that land to be allotted to settlers at Gobindapur rail colony for relocation could not be sold or leased out is aimed at keeping ?unscrupulous promoters? at bay.

 ?We want the families to leave Gobindapur peacefully and settle at the alternative site, not to sell the plots to anyone for financial gain,? urban development and municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya clarified on Wednesday.

 Sources said the government is apprehending that some ?unscrupulous realtors? may exert pressure on these families to sell the plots, so that they could make a killing by constructing highrises.

 The government has identified a site in Nonadanga, off the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, for rehabilitation of the settlers along Rabindra Sarobar, provided they agreed to vacate peacefully the railway land they have been occupying for years.

 On Wednesday, the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) handed over the Nonadanga land to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. The civic authorities will pass it on to a society formed by the settlers. The families who have enrolled with the society will get plots by December 15, minister Bhattacharya said.

 Around 2,000 of the 2,700 families living at the colony have joined the society and informed chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee about it. ?These families would not face any problem getting plots. The rest will have to include their names soon. The society will distribute the plots among individual families,? Bhattacharya added. 

 Trinamul Congress MLA Sougata Roy, who has been leading the settlers? protest against the government?s move to evict them, has warned that his party will launch an agitation if the government fails to hand over land to the families by December 15.

 Asked whether the Trinamul leader?s statements have prompted the government to speed up rehabilitation work, the minister said: ?Our government does not consider what Roy said a threat. We are handing over land to the settlers on humanitarian grounds; not under any pressure from any quarter.?

 The railway, Bhattacharya added, was supposed to arrange for alternative accommodation for the squatters, as the land belongs to it. 

 ?But the department has done nothing. Political parties are organising movements on behalf of the families to extract political mileage out of the situation. But we are not bothered with what these interested groups are doing. We have decided to offer these families alternative accommodation purely on humanitarian grounds,? Bhattacharya clarified.

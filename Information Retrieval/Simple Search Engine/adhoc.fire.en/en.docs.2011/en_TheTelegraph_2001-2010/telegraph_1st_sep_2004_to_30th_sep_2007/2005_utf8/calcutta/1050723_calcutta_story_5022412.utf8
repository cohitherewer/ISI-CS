 Green award in rerun

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The government on Friday launched the fourth edition of the Environment Excellence Award.

 ?Like the past three years, the winners will be chosen from various categories by juries comprising mostly experts from outside,? state pollution control board chairman Sudip Banerjee said at a press conference, held at the board?s Salt Lake office.

 The award, instituted jointly by the pollution control board (PCB) and the Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC) under the banner of West Bengal Cleaner Production Centre, is conferred on companies, municipalities and non-government organisations that prove themselves environment-friendly.

 The categories are large and medium companies (capital investment more than Rs 1 crore), small-scale units (investment less than Rs 1 crore), municipalities and non-government organisations. 

 Last year, the winners included the Bakreswar thermal power plant, Haldia Petrochemicals, Mitsubishi Chemical and CESC Budge Budge.

 ?The application forms can be downloaded from the websites of the PCB and ICC till August 15. The selection process will be wrapped up within three months,? said Banerjee. 

 ICC secretary-general Nazib Arif thinks the idea behind instituting the award ? to spread awareness about the environment ? has clicked.

 ?In the first year, in 2002, there had been hardly five to 10 applicants. But in the last year, even after the initial screening, around 40 industrial units, 70 non-government organisations and 10 municipalities were in the fray,? he added. 

 ?The companies are now realising that good environment practices mean good business, as it optimises resource utilisation. The understanding is reflected in the growing number of applicants,? Arif explained. 

 Siddhartha Datta of Jadavpur University, a juror since the inception of the award, said though units were now adopting environmental-control mechanisms, certain aspects, like workers? health and occupational hazards, were still neglected. 

 Another juror, Arun Biswas (of NEERI), said there were still several units that were lagging behind in enforcing environment safeguards.

 HS, crisper and current

 - National-level failures spur syllabus revamp next year

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR 

 Anukul Samanta had secured over 93 per cent marks in Madhyamik 2004 and planned to study medicine. But he fared miserably in the preliminary all-India pre-medical and pre-dental entrance examinations held earlier this month.

 Samanta?s is not the lone case. A staggering 90 per cent-plus students of Madhyamik, who prepare for all-India-level competitive exams, fail to cope up and opt for the state-level Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) instead. 

 About 20 to 25 students from Bengal do get through the preliminary examination. But they are mostly CBSE students, attuned to the competitive exam syllabus from the outset.

 Over 15,000 Higher Secondary (HS) candidates sit for all-India medical and dental exams, seeking admission to prestigious institutions, including AIIMS Delhi, AFMC Pune and other institutes in Pondicherry, Karnataka and Mumbai. 

 But each year, Calcuttans, especially those studying the HS syllabus and ICSE, for that matter, fail miserably, because their syllabus is attuned to JEE only. 

 ?The failure rate is so high that it has become a major worry for us. Of my 160 students, who scored over 93 per cent in Madhyamik 2003, only two got through the preliminary national-level examination. It is the same everywhere this year and it has been this way for ages,? says Amiya Maiti, founder-director of Dr Maiti Educational and Medical Research Institute.

 Taking a serious view of the matter, officials of the West Bengal Council for Higher Secondary Education are hopeful that students from Bengal will fare better once the HS syllabus is revamped next year.

 ?The load of books will decrease in the new syllabus. At the same time, the focus will be on contemporary issues. We believe that our students will fare much better in all-India competitive exams, once the new syllabus is introduced shortly,? said Debasish Sarkar, secretary of the HS Council.

 The new syllabus, according to experts, will be similar to that of the CBSE ? crisp and contemporary ? unlike the present HS syllabus, which has not undergone any major change for years now. 

 Students will get to learn more about genetics, greenhouse effect and cloning. 

 ?It is high time that someone thought about changing the syllabus drastically, because the students have stopped doing well in all-India-level exams. Their self-confidence has hit rock-bottom and that is not a good sign at all,? said Maiti.

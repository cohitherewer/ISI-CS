The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Now that the management of Victoria Memorial is charging an entry fee, the visitors also expect that they would be able to enjoy the serene and quiet surroundings without any disturbance. But do beggars also buy tickets to gain entry into the compound? If no, are the personnel manning the gate sleeping on duty? The authorities should see to it that nobody enters the premises, even with a ticket, with the aim of making money.

 Dev Mandi,

 The State Bank of India, Dalhousie branch, has huge notices saying that use of mobile phones is prohibited on the premises. I have rarely seen a customer do so. But the other day, I saw an employee holding a conversation on a mobile phone. When I pointed out the notice to him, he defied me to complain to the manager. When I did so, the manager confronted the man. The employee lied saying he had not used the mobile phone at all.

 Urmila Nayak, 

 Khardah. 

 I learnt at a photography exhibition on Satyajit Ray at Nandan that many more invaluable negatives of the legendary film-maker were getting destroyed due to lack of government aid to restore them. The government should construct a gallery to stock and display photographs that private collectors are unable to maintain. 

 Jyoti Baksi,

 Heysham Row.

 Journey through Odissi

 In Orissa, music, dance and spiritualism have always gone hand in hand, each nurturing the other. With time, ancient, ritualistic community dance gradually gave way to a form more stylised and formal. Soon, there came a time when dance became a means of deliverance, of entertaining the elite, or even as a means of self-expression. This evening?s Odissi performance, Sutra, traces the evolution of this classical form against the backdrop of Orissa?s cultural history. Presented in collaboration with traditional rural artistes of Orissa, it marks the height of Odissi?s popularity as a creative form between the 12th and the 16th centuries, its ban during British rule and, ultimately, it resurrection. Embracing the many facets of Orissa?s rural performing arts, it views Odissi in terms of its intrinsic link with its roots. Including various Odissi traditions like gotipua, danda, karma and sankeertan, Sutra also reinforces the fact that Odissi, being a classical form, carries the message of the past, reflects the mood of the present and, at the same time, offers scope for continued innovation in style and presentation. Performed by Sharmila Biswas and 48 dancers of Odissi Vision amp; Movement Centre. Choreographed by Sharmila Biswas. Hosted by Happenings, Open Doors and Sanskriti Sagar.

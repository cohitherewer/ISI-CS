 Fitness and weight loss, health and wellness, pampering and pleasure. Today, spas and fitness centres are like idyllic hotspots for healing and nourishment in a chaotic urban jungle.

 With a new makeover in keeping with the latest spa trends and the launch of a French beauty treatment product called Phytomer, Club Prana at the Hyatt Regency can be a preferred destination for traditional therapy and modern sophistication.

 This state-of-the-art spa has always been synonymous with a broad spectrum of massages and treatment therapies. With these new inclusions we strive to redefine the whole idea of a holistic spa, asserts a spokesperson for the EM Bypass hotel.

French connection

 Conceptualised in 1971 and with over 30 years of experience, Phytomer is quite a name in marine cosmetology, having embraced a futuristic concept.

 Its laboratory in France carries out intensive research on sea elements and solutions to skin damage, dehydrated and easily irritated skin.

 The sea has great healing powers. An organic relationship between sea water and blood plasma establishes how marine minerals and algae extracts in the depths of the sea can work wonders for the human body, explains Devdutta Sengupta Ghosh, brand manager, Luxasia, the company marketing Phytomer across Asia.

 Oligimer, which is frozen and dried sea water that has all its benefits, is the patent of Phytomer. This is an integral part in the majority of our products. Phytomer has found place in some of the leading spas worldwide, she adds.

Spa therapy

 Exclusive treatments like reflexothermale is the forte of Phytomer. Mineral mud wraps are applied on reflex zones like the soles and the spinal cord.

 A spine-and-foot massage to stimulate these sensitive areas is followed by the application of self-heating mud that is later wrapped in foils.

 A bubbly and tingly sensation is felt throughout the body and all traces of stress and over-exertion are swept away.

 Beauty is not only restricted to facial protocol; these remineralising wraps help in detoxifying the body internally, says Sharmila Kotadia, regional trainer of Luxasia.

 The Ogenage facial, an intensive hydrating treatment, promises to keep away those dreaded wrinkles and age giveaways.

 It comprises three soothing layers that ensure firmness and radiance sure to make heads turn. The first mask applied is according to the skin type, then the thermoactive prestige mask, followed by the Ogenage aqualift mask.

 All the trainers out here have received rigorous training. After all, we want to ensure the best for Calcuttans and provide them with the ultimate indulgence, smiles Sharmila.

Others

 The other treatments include relaxation facials, eye treatment, body exfoliation, cellulite treatment, scalp treatment, after sun treatment and after depilatory wax care and hair growth inhibitors.

New-look club

 Soothing music, dim lights, wooden flooring and a warm ambience... The 10,000 ft fitness centre after the makeover lives up to its name that means life force.

Suite you

Club Prana has five massage suites with options of 

enjoying the comfort of a single suite or making the spa experience more fun by 

unwinding with a friend.

 There is all the latest cardiovascular equipment around, but gymming here is not just about grunts and groans. For, the modern facilities of steam, sauna, jacuzzi, chill pool and fun shower add up to fitness with fun. Also, there are separate spas for men and women.

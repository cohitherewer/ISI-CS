The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A year for a medical test

 A STAFF REPORTER

 How long does it take to get a life-saving diagnostic test done at a state-run hospital in Calcutta? Days. At the most, a week, but certainly not a year.

 Wrong, as Saroj Pandit, a Ranchi resident, learnt a few days ago when Medical College and Hospital told him that he would have to cool his heels for more than a year to get a test done on his four-year-old son.

 Vishal has been was suffering from hearing disorders and other neurological problems, which require immediate tests to be treated.

 ?We had consulted a few doctors and they advised immediate investigation. We were asked get a Brainstem Evoked Response Audiometry (Bera) test done at the hospital. But the authorities told us that no technician was immediately available,? Saroj said.

 A few days later, he revisited the hospital and was told the test would be done on October 14, 2006. ?We came all the way from Ranchi to get a date 14 months later. There is no point waiting here any further,? said an exasperated Saroj. He later approached Medical Bank, a voluntary organisation.

 Medical Bank founder-director D. Asish spoke to the hospital superintendent, who promised to look into the matter. But nothing materialised.

 Experts are of the opinion that a Bera test can wait for a week, but not months. ?The test would have revealed what was wrong with Vishal, or whether he has a tumour in the brain,? said ENT specialist Anirban Biswas.

 Not just Bera tests, patients from the districts and neighbouring states are made to wait for months for even a scan or a simple audiometry test. 

 ?An audiometry test costs Rs 50, but private centres charge an exorbitant rate for it,? said Biswas, a consultant at Belle Vue Clinic. ?Patients go to private centres after being forced by state-run hospitals to wait for an indefinite period.?

 According to health department officials, the delay is caused by a lack of staff, machine breakdowns or a huge backlog. ?We are trying to sort out the problems,? said Santanu Tripathy, SSKM Hospital superintendent.

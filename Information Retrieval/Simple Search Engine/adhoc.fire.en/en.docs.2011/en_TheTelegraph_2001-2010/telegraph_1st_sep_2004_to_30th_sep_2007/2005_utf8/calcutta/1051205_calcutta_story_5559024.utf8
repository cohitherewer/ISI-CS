The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Boy killers waited to dump body

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Five-year-old Rick?s body lay on the floor of Bela?s bedroom for over eight hours after the Thursday murder as the Bose family plotted how to carry it out of their house unnoticed and throw it into a nearby pond, police revealed on Sunday.

 Early on Friday, a mob set ablaze and killed Bela after Rick?s body was found in the septic pit of the Bose house. 

 Bela, the alleged killer of Rick, was a patient of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and was suspicious by nature. 

 According to Akhilesh Pal, the psychiatrist who was treating her, Bela complained of low confidence and admitted to washing utensils repeatedly.

 ?She even had insomnia and related disorders. But she never had any history of picking fights with someone or suddenly turning violent. It was impossible for her to plan anything in advance,? Pal told Metro. 

 Sleuths reconstructed Rick?s murder on the basis of statements provided by Bela?s husband, Rabindra Nath Bose, who was also set on fire, and their son, Kaushik. Both are now in MR Bangur Hospital.

 ?Though the father and son were not involved in the killing, they played a role in hiding the body. They even tried to mislead Rick?s father,? said S.N. Gupta, superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas.

 After examining Rick?s body, doctors observed that he had been murdered within an hour of leaving his house. 

 ?The boy?s family members told us that he had drunk a glass of milk around 9.30 am. Then, he had stepped out to play,? said an officer.

 Quoting the statements of Rabindra Nath and Kaushik, he added: ?The two came to know about the incident only on Thursday afternoon, when they found Rick?s body in one of the rooms.?

 They had planned to dump the body into a pond and accordingly, left Rick?s slippers on the bank of the waterbody around 5.30 pm. By then, local people had gathered in front of Rick?s house.

 ?Kaushik then slipped out of his house and called the child?s father, Surajit, from a telephone booth in Taratala around 7.30 pm. He told Surajit to come to Taratala with a large number of people to receive Rick,? said an officer.

 Kaushik had expected that Surajit would set out for Taratala with most of the people who had gathered outside his residence. 

 Kaushik made another call to Surajit, this time from Bishnupur. But it did not click. With no way out, Bela, Rabindra Nath and Kaushik dumped the body into the septic pit.

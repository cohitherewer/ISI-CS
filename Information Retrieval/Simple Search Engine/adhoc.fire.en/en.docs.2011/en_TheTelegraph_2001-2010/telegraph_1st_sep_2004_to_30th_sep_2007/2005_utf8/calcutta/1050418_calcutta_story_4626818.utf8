The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Research centre at CU on Pakistan

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 In an attempt to strengthen economic, political and cultural ties between India and Pakistan, Calcutta University (CU), in a first-ever move of its kind, has decided to open a centre for conducting advanced research and studies on Pakistan. 

 The proposed centre aims at carrying out ?serious scholarly research? on how to cope with present-day problems of ?barriers of narrow nationalism and the politics of terrorism?, said Suranjan Das, pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs) , who is also a professor of history at CU.

 Apart from Pakistan, the proposed centre also aims at conducting studies on Afghanistan, Iran and Iraq. 

 The university has already submitted a proposal to the University Grants Commission (UGC), seeking permission to open the centre. Once the UGC nod arrives, CU will be the first university in the east and northeast to have a centre devoted to research in this field, sources said. The university has sought about Rs 25 lakh from the UGC to set up the centre.

 ?The ongoing dialogue between India and Pakistan has immense and far-reaching potential. Scholars of the proposed centre will investigate this potential and explore how such dialogues can promote comprehensive cooperation between the two countries,? said Das. 

 The centre will explore the ways in which India can promote economic cooperation with Pakistan, Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan, which may remove the existing political rift in the region.

 Explaining further the areas of studies proposed at the centre, Das said: ?The emergence of the US as the sole superpower, aggravation of inequity among countries and terrorism with a religious cover are some of the issues that concern our country. Through our research, our scholars will find out ways for building a multipolar world so that the tendency of the sole superpower to practise the theory of new imperialism can be curbed.?

 Officials hope the research will contribute to strengthen the existing links between India and the four countries. 

 ?For instance, India must gain reliable access to the oil and natural gas of Iran and Iraq and the proposed centre will suggest ways to accelerate the process,? the proposal said.

 The research will cover history, geopolitics, trade and science and technology of the countries.

 The university does not want to recruit additional faculty members for the centre. Since the research will be based on a wide range of subjects, the authorities plan to engage teachers already serving the history, political science, sociology, economics, Arabic, Persian, Hindi and Urdu departments.

 Tutor shot in rent row

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bimal Ghati, 36, a tutor, was shot dead on Sunday night in Salkia, Howrah, allegedly over a property dispute. 

 Police said development of the property, on which Ghati and his two brothers lived, was the preliminary cause of the murder. ?Three men ? Tapan Dutta, Prasanta Dutta and Susanto Mondal ? have been arrested,? said superintendent of police Mihir Kumar Bhattacharya on Monday.

 A successful tutor, Ghati had been in the profession for the past 10 years. He had taken on rent a portion of 187, Benaras Road, in Howrah. 

 Neighbours said he and his two brothers, who lived in the same house, used to pay the rent to landlady Tarubala Sadhukhan. After her death three years ago, the Ghatis used to remit the rent through the rent controller to her adopted son and heir, Baidyanath Goswami. 

 A few days ago, Tapan Dutta, another tenant of Sadhukhan?s, claimed that he was entitled to the rent, as he had purchased the property, and asked the Ghatis to leave the premises as early as possible, said a neighbour. 

 The Duttas failed to produce any valid documents pertaining to the purchase of Sadhukhan?s property after Tapan?s arrest, said the police. 

 Nonetheless, the Duttas had planned to sell off the property so that a multi-storeyed building could come up there. 

 The Ghatis refused to budge, despite threats from the Duttas. They even sought a lawyer?s advice. 

 On Sunday, only younger brother Amal went to the lawyer. Amal could not find Bimal when he returned from the lawyer?s. He lodged a complaint with Golabari police station. Back home, he heard that earlier, a man?s body was found close by and it was taken to TL Jaiswal Hospital. When Amal went there, he discovered that it was Bimal?s. 

 On Monday morning, Bimal?s students blocked GT Road to protest the murder. When police lathicharged them, they turned violent and threw stones at passing vehicles. Later, the situation was brought under control.

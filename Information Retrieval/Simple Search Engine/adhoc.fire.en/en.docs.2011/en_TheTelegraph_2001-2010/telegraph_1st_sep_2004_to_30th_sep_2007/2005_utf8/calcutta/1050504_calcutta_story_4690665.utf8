The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Kenji Shimizu

 Consul-general of Japan, Calcutta

 In my personal view, the concept should work fine. There is growing interest in introducing this concept in Japan, though it has not been finalised. The sun rises quite early in Bengal, even before five o?clock, and it becomes dark soon after 6 pm. If you advance work timing, you can finish work before it gets dark. As a result, electricity consumption can be reduced significantly in the evening. I feel you can also improve people?s quality of life, by giving them time for shopping, evening walk, sports etc. The point of the idea is you can get economic benefits without straining financial resources. West Bengal stretches from north to south like a corridor, which is fit for such a concept geographically, as well.

 The expatriate Indian, working abroad to send his family a monthly packet, is the silver lining for India Post as it turns 150. 

 ?We have entered into an agreement with Western Union, an international money remitting agency. In India, the system works one way with Indians being allowed only to send money back to the country,? said post master general Manojit Kumar.

 And wonder of wonders, it is Bogula, a small town in Nadia district, which is generating the highest number of transactions across the country in this category. 

 ?The average is around 50 transactions a day while on some days it shoots up to 90. The amount may not be more than Rs 10,000-Rs 15,000 every month. In fact, in terms of the total amount of transaction, the states in south India outstrip all other regions. But Bogula, followed by Helencha Colony in Barasat, is way ahead in numbers,? Kumar beamed.

 The Western Union procedure is simple, which is why people from even rural backwaters have confidence in it. There is no need to open an account. The person trying to send money can deposit it at the office where he is, give the address and inform home of the code he is given. The payee has to report the code to the local post office and collect the money. ?Thus, money can change hands from say, Dubai to Nadia in an hour,? Kumar explained.

 Little customer-friendly measures too have paved way for this the success story. ?During the initial months, the Bogula post master had complained that since there was just one bench to sit on for those in queue, he was at risk of losing customers. I told him once he reached 300 transactions, his post office would get a television set. The target was reached soon and Bogula has a TV set to entertain its customers now. 

 In fact, this pampering is part of the Western Union marketing strategy and is a pre-condition for tie-ups. ?They also wanted us to offer soft drinks to clients. Our post masters suggested a box of sweets instead.?

 This success comes amid not-so-starry a picture in these technologically advanced times. ?The Indian postal system in in transition. It is true that personal mail is dipping. But we have seen in the West how the loss of business in personal mail has been set off by an increase in commercial mail. We think the trend will be replicated here.?

 The e-post experiment, launched in 2004, has not taken off either. ?We are trying to attract bulk users like banks for issuing account statements through us,? he said.

 Kumar was speaking on a day when a book celebrating India Post?s sesquicentennial year was launched by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, in presence of writer Mahasveta Devi. In 1854, the modern Indian stamps had been issued in Lord Dalhousie?s regime. ?I still get 80 per cent of my correspondence via post. Does email have the romance of a hand-written letter?? the chief minister asked. Surely not.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 700 target in tap-snap drive rerun

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 Pay up or dry up.

 That?s the message the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) sent out to water-tax defaulters on Monday, as it decreed the snapping of supply lines of around 700 non-residential establishments. 

 The defaulters together owe around Rs 7 crore as water tax to the civic authorities.

 The order to disconnect the supply, signed by municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay, is likely to be implemented after mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya returns from Agartala on Thursday.

 Among the 700 defaulters are the FCI office (dues around Rs 5.23 lakh), Customs House (Rs 7.84 lakh), Eden Gardens (Rs 5.21) and BR Singh Hospital (Rs 5.06 lakh).

 Other prominent institutions on the list include the Cantonment (Barrackpore), Indian Bank (11, Sevak Baidya Street), United Industrial Bank (College Street market), Central Bank of India (33, Netaji Subhas Road), Agri-Horticultural Society of India, Girish Mancha, Gyan Bharati School, Circular Railway (Burrabazar station), Metro Railway, Calcutta Stock Exchange and the Cricket Association of Bengal.

 ?We cannot distribute filtered water free,? said commissioner Bandyopadhyay. ?We have to pay for the water and filter it. We have to pay the CESC and Calcutta Metropolitan Water and Sanitation Authority. The civic body cannot afford to ignore its interests.?

 According to chief engineer (water supply) Dibyendu Roychaudhury, the maximum a defaulter owes to the civic coffers a year is Rs 28,000.

 Officials, however, admitted that what the list revealed was the tip of the default iceberg. An estimate of the water supply department pegs the total number of water-tax defaulters at 5,000 and the amount due from them at Rs 10 crore. Repeated reminders to them to clear the backlog have have yielded no response.

 Severing supplies to force defaulters to cough up outstanding tax was first resorted to in 2003 ? when Subrata Mukherjee was mayor ? following a clearance from the high court. Supply to two star hotels was stopped at that time.

 The mayor had said that he was exploring the possibility of exempting government educational institutions from water tax. But the decision has been taken only in principle. 

 To implement such a measure, a policy has to be framed and the state government has to ratify it.

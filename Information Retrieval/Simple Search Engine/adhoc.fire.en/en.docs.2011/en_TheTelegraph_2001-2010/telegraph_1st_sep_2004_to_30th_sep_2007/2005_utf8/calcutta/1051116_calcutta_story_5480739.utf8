 Neglect death cases gather dust

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Three cases have been added in November to the long list of negligence death complaints at state-run hospitals. As in the past, no one has been taken to task.

 On November 14, Tayeb Hussain died in Medical College and Hospital, allegedly due to negligence. A police case was lodged, but not even a preliminary investigation has been conducted in the past 24 hours.

 The 25-year-old, from Narkeldanga?s KB First Lane, was brought to the hospital for an emergency operation. He died hours later, while the staff ?looked around? for a bed.

 On the same morning, at the same hospital, a 70-year-old died of cardiac ailments. Her son has accused the staff of neglect. In this case, too, the cops haven?t bothered to start a probe.

 Even in cases where an inquiry has been ordered and a committee set up, precious little has resulted. The death of overweight baby Lokman Mondal, for example.

 The 11-month-old died in May while being fed at the paediatric ward of SSKM Hospital. Animal resources minister Anisur Rahman called for an inquiry that has not yielded results in five months. 

 Nur Islam Mondal?s death in the same hospital on November 4 has not even resulted in an inquiry. 

 A resident of Brahmapur, in South 24-Parganas, Mondal died in the cardiology department following an angioplasty. 

 Nur?s relative S.P. Mondal alleged that the surgery was performed on the diabetic against his family?s wishes. A complaint was lodged with Bhowanipore police station. Hospital superintendent Shantanu Tripathi is ?looking into the matter?.

 ?It?s not that we don?t take action. Unless the inquiry indicts a doctor or nursing staff, we cannot do anything,? stated Jayshree Mitra, director of medical education.

 According to health department insiders, inquiries tend to nail the system rather than the individual, allowing guilty doctors to go scot-free.

 In rare instances, a doctor is suspended till an inquiry is over. As in the case of Rajnis Patel, 17, who died after five botched surgeries at SSKM.

 Mostly, the matter rests after a stern warning. The doctor of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital allegedly responsible for the death of five-year-old Riya Das in August got away with just a rebuke. 

 He refused to admit the girl to the paediatrics ward on two successive days.

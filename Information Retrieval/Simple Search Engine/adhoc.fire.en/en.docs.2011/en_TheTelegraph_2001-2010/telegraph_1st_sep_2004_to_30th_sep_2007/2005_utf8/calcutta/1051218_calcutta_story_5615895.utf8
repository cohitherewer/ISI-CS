 Flight of the fish, on stage and off

 They are like the fish that jumps up from the water, glides through the air for some time and dives back into the seabed. Chucking cushy jobs in Berlin and Birmingham, they are now footloose for the sake of theatre. Yet at the end of a half-year tour of the eastern part of the globe, they will return to their roots. Just like the flying fish.

 On Saturday, Flying Fish lifted the curtains on Nandikar?s 22nd National Theatre Festival; the theatre group from Germany took the Academy of Fine Arts stage for Oscar Wilde?s The Nightingale and the Rose. 

 With a 16-member team ? made up of eight actors, two musicians, two dancers, a puppeteer, two stage and costume designers and the director ? Flying Fish has embarked on an eight-month tour of India, Nepal and Pakistan. During its five-month stay in India, the group will be involved in exchange programmes with various theatre centres, hold workshops and performances.

 The troubadour troupe took shape in Berlin where five Germans of the core team are based. The sixth member is an Indian NSD graduate, Ashwat Bhatt, who shifted out of Birmingham to join the team in Germany. 

 ?Flying Fish was particularly founded for this journey. All of us quit our jobs and planned the project for two-and-a-half years. The six of us would come together and meet once a month? The aim is to build an international theatre company,? stresses group director Harry Fuhrmann, a 36-year-old Berlin-born actor-director. 

 Associate director Ashwat feels the project sounded ?well thought off? for him to take the plunge. ?It?s not just a journey, but a rediscovery of so many things ? for instance, the state of our folk forms, and commercial and group theatre,? says the 30-something who grew up in strife-torn Kashmir and did his masters at London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts.

 The adaptation of the Oscar Wilde work weaves in acting, music, dance and puppetry. And Fuhrmann feels they have already worked some ?Indian elements? into the play. The use of Chhau masks for one. But the director stresses that they are ?shying away? from rampant fusion of western and eastern theatrical traditions. ?Finding the essence of both is most important,? he adds.

 As part of the preparation, the group rehearsed for four months, travelling to Croatia, France and the Czech Republic. The Asia tour was kicked off with a two-week stay in Nepal, where Flying Fish conducted extensive workshops with school children. 

 The India leg began in November with workshops at Ilambazar and Siliguri. ?We picked two people ? one actor and a musician ? who will join our group in January,? says an elated Fuhrmann. After Calcutta, Flying Fish?s route map takes it to Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Bihar, Rajasthan, Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Winding up its Asia tour in mid-April, Flying Fish will return to Germany and put up a production on their experiences in India and Nepal.

 stranger, now a star 

 She is no ajnabee to the city having come here on many an occasion. But when Perizaad Zorabian came to Calcutta on Friday (picture by Aranya Sen), she was not only Devaki?s Nandini, but one of Mumbai?s youngest restaurateurs and a confident leading lady post-Ek Ajnabee, with a Nikhil Advani film in her kitty. And she was as chirpy as ever... 

 On Devaki: When Bappaditya Bandopadhyay came to me with the script, I knew there was no commercial value in it. But I found the script to be very different from the usual male-bashing feminist films. I agreed to do it and it feels so good today that my gut instincts paid off. It?s not only made it to 11 international film festivals but defeated George Clooney?s Good Night and Good Luck to win the Best Film award at the Asheville Film Festival!

 On Ek Ajnabee: Everybody advised me not to do a film where I play a mother of an eight-year-old and a film that?s only about Mr Bachchan. And today people are calling me up to say that I have done a great job. 

 On Salaam-e-Ishq: My mother read somewhere that director Nikhil Advani (Kal Ho Naa Ho) is looking for actors and not stars. I messaged Nikhil saying that I would love to audition if he was still looking for people. But when I was told it was a romantic comedy, I almost gave it up. I didn?t think I would be able to do comedy. My mother again convinced me saying that I am very funny. So I am finally doing the film. 

 On Gondola: My father owned this restaurant in Bandra from the 1970s and I have taken it over from him. I have personally looked into the menu. I want authentic Parsi fare to be the USP.

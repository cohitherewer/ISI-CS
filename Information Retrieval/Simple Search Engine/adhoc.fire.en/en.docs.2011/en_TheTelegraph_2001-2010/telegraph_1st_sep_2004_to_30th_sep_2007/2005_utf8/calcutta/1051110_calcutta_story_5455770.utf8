 Festive strokes

 Exploring the inherent mood of happiness, harmony and creativity associated with the festive season, Samokal Art Gallery hosts Utsav-2005, an exhibition of paintings featuring works by celebrated masters and budding talents of the art world. Envisaged as a confluence of creative minds, the ongoing show presents a collection of traditional and modern Indian paintings from different parts of the country. Holding pride of place are a couple of peerless paintings by Satyendra Nath Bandopadhyay (one of them appears above), one of the most illustrious contemporaries of Nandalal Bose. Other participating artists include Ramananda Bandopadhyay, B.R. Paneswar, Shanu Lahiri, Isha Mohammad, Bijon Choudhury, Prakash Karmakar, Dwijen Gupta, Eleena Banik, Ratan Acharya, Samir Roy, Shibani Sengupta, Shyamal Baran Saha, Anirban Seth, Dilip Banerjee, Jayanta Khan, Sumita Paul and Alobaran Pradhan. Expressing the artistic tone and temper of succeeding periods, the works on show also highlight the thoughts and ideas that prevailed during that age. However, they also reveal the common artistic vision of a world in tune with nature and free from violence.

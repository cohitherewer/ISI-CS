 Cut in grandeur, not in glory

 P. Pramanik,

 Santoshpur Avenue

 The new pandal rules, if implemented, are undoubtedly going to affect the Puja grandeur, but will also provide relief to many motorists and pedestrians. Puja subscription rates are likely to come down as a result. 

B.N. Bose, 

 Dum Dum Park

 It is evident that the organisers are going to find ways to prevent the Puja grandeur from being hampered due to the new rules. I believe the pandal rules will make the Puja more enjoyable.

 Sudipa Dutta Chowdhury, 

 Dum Dum Park

 The new rules may rob Puja of grandeur, but will certainly provide relief to many. Grandeur at the cost of discontent and risk is not welcome. The rules are for the benefit of the common man and hence, should be enforced.

 Prem Pada Mallick,

 Kalindi 

 The government should not restrict Puja celebrations by enforcing rules. Residents of the city wait through the year to enjoy the Puja days to the fullest.

 Diptimoy Ghosh, 

 Salt Lake

 Nowhere in the world does a community celebrate a festival by blocking important roads. Why should a section of the people have to pay for the merry-making of others? Puja grandeur will not be affected once the new rules come into effect. The celebrations will instead become more disciplined.

 D.P. Bhattacharya,

 Sonarpur

 Organising a Durga puja is a difficult task, involving a lot of official permissions. If the government imposes stringent restrictions on top of that, the organisers are going to be discouraged.

 Jyoti Baksi,

 Heysham Row 

 Pandals do not block the roads only during the Puja. The encroachments are not removed days afterwards and the carriageways damaged during the celebrations are never repaired. Also, many organisers hold soirees that block the roads before the Puja. These practices cause harassment to the commuters and passersby. The safety aspects of the Pujas are never taken into consideration. Given the situation, the pandal rules were urgently needed. There should also be a curb on holding new Pujas.

 Debasish Chakraborty,

 Cossipore

 The new pandal rules will impose unfair restrictions on the creativity of Puja organisers. 

 NIdhi Poddar,

 Salt Lake

 The pandal rules will lead to a better Puja. The move to net in the filth released on the Hooghly during immersion is also praiseworthy.

 Sandhya Banerjee,

 Salt Lake

 The new rules are quite justified. Pandals cannot restrict the movement of the ordinary people. Puja is for the public and by the public. Huge pandals blocking the roads in no way enhance the grandeur of the Puja. 

 Rumela Roy Chowdhury, 

 Salt Lake

 There should be restrictions on Durga puja, but too much rigidity will spoil the charm of the event.

 Sachindra Nath Mitra,

 Rakhal Ghosh Lane

 The new pandal rules should be strictly followed for the sake of the people. The fun of the Puja won?t be spoilt by the safety guideline.

 Basant Choudhary,

 Kankinara

 I hope the grandeur of the festival does not diminish this year. The rules have been formulated to ensure enjoyment for everyone. They will prove effective. 

 Arunava Bose Chowdhury,

 Barrackpore

 For the past few years, several organisers have been involved in unhealthy competition over their Pujas. In the process, they have caused unnecessary harassment to people for a week or more. If certain guidelines are imposed on Pujas, the festive spirit will not suffer. People will accept the changes gladly.

 A. Bhattacharya,

 Narendrapur

 The pandal rules have probably been introduced to ensure decency and discipline during the festivities. In no way are the rules going to dampen the spirits. Pandal-hoppers, as usual, will throng the streets. 

 Debasree Mukherjee,

 Salt Lake

 The new rules should be made mandatory to increase the charm of Durga puja and make it easy for people to move from pandal to pandal.

 Arjun Chaudhuri,

 Mohesh Chaudhuri Lane

 The pandal rules will add to the grandeur of the Puja. Lack of concern for the people and faulty planning have long undermined the latent potential of the autumn event. There is, after all, no point in spending a fortune on decorations, if people cannot enjoy them. It remains to be seen how far the rules are implemented.

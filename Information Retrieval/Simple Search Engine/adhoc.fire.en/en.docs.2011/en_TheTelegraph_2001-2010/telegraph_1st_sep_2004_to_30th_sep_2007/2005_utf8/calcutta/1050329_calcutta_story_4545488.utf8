 Sons told to take back old widow

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court on Monday ruled in favour of an aged mother who had been thrown out of her house by her two sons.

 Maya Roy Chowdhury, 70, a resident of Rishi Bankim Chandra Road, in Dum Dum, complained to the court that her two sons ? Asish and Biswajit ? had forced her to leave her house. 

 She had also lodged a complaint with the local thana, but police did not take any action. 

 After hearing both sides, Justice Pranab Chatterjee ordered counsel for the brothers Uttam Majumdar: ?Ask your clients to spare a room for their mother.?

 The judge, however, observed that it was beyond the court?s jurisdiction to ask the brothers to pay for their mother?s upkeep. ?The petitioner will have to move another court for that,? he added.

 Roy Chowdhury?s lawyer Amal Baran Chatterjee told the court that his client?s husband had constructed the house in 1990. Following his death in 1995, the ownership passed on to the widow.

 ?But her two sons and their wives turned her out and also refused to either feed or clothe her,? Chatterjee submitted. 

 Roy Chowdhury had no option but to take shelter in the house of her daughter?s in-laws in Belghoria.

 Counsel Chatterjee also informed the court that his client wanted to sell the building. 

 ?One of the prospective buyers had agreed to pay Rs 16 lakh and Roy Chowdhury was ready to pay her sons their shares, but they would not allow the sale.?

 She left the house when her sons started torturing her physically. 

 ?My client lodged several complaints with Dum Dum police station, but no action was taken against the accused,? Chatterjee alleged.

 Roy Chowdhury had let out a portion of the building, ?but her sons forced the tenant to leave?, the lawyer added. 

 Counsel for the accused opposed the petition, saying the allegations were not true. He said his clients had no objection to their mother living in the house. 

 Sources said at least 50 similar petitions are pending in the high court. Almost all the petitioners have alleged that they have been tortured regularly by their sons and daughters-in-law. 

 ?In all the cases, the petitioners alleged that police did not take any action against the accused,? a source said. 

 In at least 20 cases, the court stood by the aged house-owners to save them from the torture of their sons and daughters-in-law.

Free water nod: The state government on Monday 

accepted mayor Subrata Mukherjee?s request to supply free an additional 10 million 

gallons of filtered water from the Garden Reach waterworks to feed the Kalighat 

booster pumping station. 

 The decision was taken on Monday after Mukherjee?s discussions with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya earlier in the day.

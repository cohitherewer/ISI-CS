 Court for vigil at Home

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court last week expressed grave concern over the care of inmates at the Liluah home for undertrial women.

 A division bench, comprising Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice A.K. Ganguly, while delivering judgment on a public interest litigation, directed the state government to take all possible steps to ensure that the health of the inmates was not affected.

 The superintendent of police, Howrah, was asked to maintain a round-the-clock vigil so that ?women inmates were not molested by the male staff of the home?.

 The court stated in its order: ?A total of 120 inmates are at the mercy of an untrained compounder, as no doctor is prepared to spend time at the home, though there are residential facilities for medical practitioners. The state has to maintain a constant vigil so that the health of the inmates is not affected.? 

 The bench added: ?The petitioner of the case also complained about escape of under-trial inmates and physical assault on them. The government should take steps to prevent the inmates from escaping.? 

 The court stressed that the management should maintain strict control over the male staff of the home.

 The bench further ruled: ?The state human rights commission should send teams from time to time to check whether the inmates are safe and are being kept in a proper environment.?

 The court order mentioned that 15 posts in the home, out of a total of 70 posts, were lying vacant. The judges called for vacant posts to be filled up immediately.

 Advocate Tapas Bhanja moved the plea.

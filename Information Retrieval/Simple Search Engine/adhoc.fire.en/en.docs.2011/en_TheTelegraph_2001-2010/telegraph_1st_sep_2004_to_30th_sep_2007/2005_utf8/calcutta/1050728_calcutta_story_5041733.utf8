 School for skills in alternative software 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 With an open-source software wave sweeping the tech world, demand for training programmes on Linux has increased in the city.

 And to address the issue, Nettech, in association with XLRI Jamshedpur, organised a 30-day programme on network management in Linux environment for engineering students. 

 ?Everyone is interested in learning Linux. But there is a dearth of quality professionals to impart the necessary skills. That?s why we have joined hands with XLRI to deliver the training,? said Swapan Purkait, who set up Nettech after completing his MBA from the Jamshedpur-based B-school.

 According to him, over 250 students from various engineering colleges ? like the Institute of Engineering and Management in Salt Lake, Haldia Engineering College, Kalyani Government Engineering College and Asansol Engineering College ? applied to log in for the programme at St Xavier?s College. 

 Besides staff from Nettech, which specialises in delivering Linux training modules, the other resource persons for the training programme included Swarup Mandal, professor, XLRI, and Debasish Saha, professor, IIM Calcutta. 

 Fifty students were selected for the course ? billed as the first of its kind in the city ? after screening the pool of applications. 

 ?The students want to know about managing networks in Linux environment as this increases their employability. These days, companies like Infosys, IBM and Wipro prefer people with competence in Linux and that explains the rise in interest among the student community,? added Purkait.

 The course covered understanding Linux ? file, print, messaging, directory and management services ? and installing, configuring and troubleshooting. 

 For certification, the candidates need to pass the online as well as simulated laboratory examination to test their real competency and skills in operating in Linux environment.

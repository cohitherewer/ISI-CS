 Computer basics in 42 hours

 Children need it to keep in touch with the times. And parents need it, among other things, to keep in touch with the children.

 Yet, training courses in the basic aspects of computers are few and far between. Internet and Computing Core Certification (IC?) programme, a recently-launched e-learning initiative, plans to change that and bridge the gap between the tech-savvy and the technologically-challenged.

 Developed by US-based Certiport, the 42-hour online course offers basics on the use of the operating system and common Windows-based programmes like Word and Excel. There are also modules on networking, using the Internet and email.

 The hardware section provides training in identifying different types of computers, common problems associated with individual computer components, and even determining the factors for purchasing a PC.

 ?Though the course is for everyone, we are particularly targeting housewives and kids,? said a spokesperson for Reliance Infocomm, which has tied up with Certiport to offer the course at its WebWorld outlets.

 ?I know how to use the computer but I don?t think that is enough,? felt Kumkum Khaitan, a 55-year-old Montessori teacher who has enrolled for IC?. ?The duration flexibility, proximity to a WebWorld and the price are what made me opt for it,? she added.

 The 42 hours of training can be spread over a period of six months. At the end of it, students are awarded a course-completion certificate. They can then appear for a certification examination. Training costs Rs 2,999 and the examination costs Rs 2,000 more.

 ?A PC helps me in trading shares and looking up details of Supreme Court cases,? said 53-year-old H.P. Vyas, a law practitioner. ?I?ve just learnt about this course and I?m signing up immediately.?

 The programme is also finding takers among youngsters. Arijit Nandy, juggling a call centre job with college studies, plans to utilise the afternoons ? his only free time ? to complete the course. 

 ?The certificate will help me move ahead in the BPO industry,? he hoped.

 Sandip Chatterjee, a BCA student working part-time for a mobile phone company, also feels IC? will prepare him for a higher level computer course.

 ?Over 47,000 IC? examinations are administered each month through more than 9,000 testing centres in 114 countries and 18 languages,? the Reliance Infocomm spokesperson said. ?In India, 240 WebWorld outlets are offering the service.?

 Little big dog with a sense of humour

Pet Passion

 You haven?t lived until you?ve 

 been owned by a Pug!? says Pug Dog Club of America. Pugs 

 are said to be an acquired habit and they become addictive! 

 But if you want a ?lot of dog in a small space? ? one that 

 thinks it?s a big dog, loves all people and makes you laugh 

 hysterically ? then consider a Pug. 

 The Pug is of Chinese origin and 

 dates back to the pre-Christian era. They were prized possessions 

 of the emperors of China and lived in a most luxurious atmosphere, 

 sometimes even guarded by soldiers. It received its name 

 from the Latin word that means ?clenched fist?. 

 A Pug is more massive and solid 

 than most fellow toy dogs. He is stubby and muscular with 

 a wide chest, straight, very strong front legs, well-muscled 

 hind legs and an unblinking stare. To communicate with humans 

 they make the silliest noises ? snorting and gruntling like 

 a pig.

 Pugs are a very tough and individualistic 

 breed. They know what they want and stand their ground to 

 get it. Pugs make you smile a lot because they are clowns 

 at heart with a terrific sense of humour, complete with 

 comical expressions! A pug is always ready for fun and games, 

 but at the same time he carries himself with great dignity. 

 He is eager to please and his biggest need is that you love 

 him in return. He will sulk if you exclude him from your 

 activities. Snuggling at your feet snoring or being comfortably 

 ensconced on your lap are some of his favourite activities.

 Pugs are adaptable, extremely 

 loyal and good-natured, and take to training easily. Although 

 strong-willed, they are affectionate family companions. 

 They require minimal grooming; a walk in the compound will 

 be all the exercise they need. A common problem faced by 

 vets is obesity. Pugs will eat till they burst and always 

 ?act? hungry even if they are well-fed. You have to watch 

 their weight. 

 Pugs are big shedders and must 

 have air conditioning in the summer. With their short, pushed-in 

 face, they can have trouble breathing, especially if there 

 is high heat and humidity. They must be exercised with caution 

 in summer. 

 Pay special attention to your 

 Pug?s ears and clean them regularly. It is time to see your 

 vet if you notice any redness, heavy discharge, odour, or 

 head shaking. You can bathe them when necessary and clean 

 wrinkles on their forehead to prevent moisture accumulation 

 and facial fold skin infections. You must protect the eyes 

 from injury, dry eyelids and eyelashes.

 There is nothing cuter than a 

 Pug puppy. But breeding your Pug requires much thought, 

 research, time and money. Should you decide to breed your 

 Pug, extensive health testing should be done first to ensure 

 no health problems might be passed on. Also, Pugs frequently 

 need caesarian sections. If you are a dog lover, you already 

 know about the incredible pet overpopulation problem. The 

 responsible thing to do is to spay or neuter before your 

 Pug is six months old.

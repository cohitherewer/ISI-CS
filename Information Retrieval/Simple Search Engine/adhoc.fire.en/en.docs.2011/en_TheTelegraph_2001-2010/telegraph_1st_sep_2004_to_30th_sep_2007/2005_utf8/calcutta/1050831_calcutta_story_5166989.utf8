 After successful ventures in Bhowanipore, Ballygunge and at City Centre, Just Casuals has come up with its fourth outlet, this time on Lindsay Street.

 The idea is to make its collection accessible to a much wider base of bargain shoppers, fashion hunters and trendy teenagers looking for good clothes at good prices.

 Kids can pick and choose from a summer collection of tees bearing brands like Mothercare, Columbia, Old Navy, Essential and Early Days. Women can spoil themselves silly with capris from Quizz and Longboard, T-shirts from Hennes, earthy, sandwashed and reflecting tops from Smoking and Faded Glory, and cool spaghettis from Kimubha amp; Fiorlini. Pleasant-looking drawstrings from Banana Republic are a major draw.

 Men need not be disappointed either, as there are pastels, checks and solids in shirts from Nautica, Polo, USE, Johnny Lamb and Mossimo for them to choose from.

 They can also take their pick of T-shirts from Old Navy, Kiabi, Callaway, Cutter amp; Buck. Also available are flat fronts, six pockets and three-quarter pants from GAP, Columbia, BR and Timberland, and heat-buster shorts from Basics and Edgar. The garments are all priced between Rs 60 and Rs 600.

 Bengali bite

 The Bay of Bengal at 6, Dr Satyananda Roy Road, near Menoka cinema, is an address for Bengali cuisine. And it has made more than a few additions to its menu.

 In most nuclear families today, it is difficult for working women to cook up tedious grandma recipes. We strive to hold on to these traditional delights that are slowly fading out. Foodies can enjoy the taste of home-made Bengali food along in the warm informal atmosphere, says Debapriya Banerjee, co-owner of the eatery.

 The latest inclusions from the month of September are ?Mochar Paturi (steamed banana blossom ground along with coconut, green chillies, mustard and salt, wrapped in banana leaves, smeared with mustard oil and left to cook on a low flame), Pomfret Paturi (pomfret marinated in mustard paste, green chilli, mustard oil, wrapped in banana leaves and finally served fried or steamed), Chhana Bata (a combination of fresh cottage cheese, coconut, green chillies, mustard seed, mustard oil and salt).

 Then there is the Tetul Ilish (Ilish cooked in tamarind sauce, turmeric, ground red chilli and cumin seeds) up for choice.

 Apart from appetisers like Aam Pora Sharbot, chutneys and set meals, the existing menu offers delicacies like Kumro Phool Bhaja, Mochar Ghanto, Lau Chingri, Kankra Jhal and Murgir Jhol. 

 The assortment of sweet endings includes Malpua, Rasamalancha and Rasamalai.

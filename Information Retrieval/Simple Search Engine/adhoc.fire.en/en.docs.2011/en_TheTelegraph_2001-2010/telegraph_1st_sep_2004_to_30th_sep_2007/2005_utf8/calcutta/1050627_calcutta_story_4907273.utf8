The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You cant get through the week 

 without

 Guzzling to your hearts 

 content

 Parched throats after the 

 extended dry spell last week due to civic elections provide 

 the perfect beer binge excuse this week. Move on to harder 

 stuff as the week progresses if the dip in the temperature 

 continues. Wednesday should be the wine day in any case 

 for girls if they want to make the most of the cool promotions 

 at various nightclubs offering ladies specials. Hic!

 Getting drenched in the rain

 Forget your umbrella at 

 home and get drenched in the first monsoon showers to wash 

 off the memories of the 40-degree heat and grime, before 

 it all comes back to haunt you again. Sneeze with a vengeance 

 thereafter. They just might take pity and give you a day 

 off to enjoy a rainy day curled up in bed with your favourite 

 book, endless cups of tea and piping hot pakoras! 

 Heaven isnt as far as you think.

 Heading for a sea resort

 The sun and the sea are 

 not the only partners on a cool holiday. Make a weekend 

 trip to a neighbouring sea resort to enjoy the weepy romance 

 of rains lashing the endless waters. Digha, Puri, Chandipur, 

 Shankarpur, Bakkhali? Make do with what you have!

 Investing in sturdy gear

 Its okay to throw 

 caution to the wind once in a while, but if you overdo it, 

 your boss might throw you out of office and on to the waterlogged 

 streets for good. So do invest in trendy umbrellas and raincoats 

 to make a splash in style. Bid the last of monsoon woes 

 goodbye by including a pair of sturdy gumboots in your wardrobe. 

 These will save your denims and trousers the ignominy of 

 brown spray paint.

 Forming a band

 World Music Day has come 

 and gone but if you want to extend the celebrations, dont 

 wait for musicians to entertain you. Rock it yourself by 

 learning how to sing or play an instrument. Go ahead, form 

 a band. If they dont offer you a platform to rock 

 roll right away, do it in your garage. Thats 

 how most of them started off in any case!

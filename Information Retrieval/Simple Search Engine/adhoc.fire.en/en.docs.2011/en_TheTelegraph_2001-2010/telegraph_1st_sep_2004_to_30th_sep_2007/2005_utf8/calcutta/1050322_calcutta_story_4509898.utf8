The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

You can?t get through this week without

 Getting drenched in Holi hues

The festival might have got more civilised over the years, but the joie de vivre 

associated with Holi persists. Getting drenched in lurid colours may be great 

fun, but the beauty conscious might like to try out natural colours instead of 

experimenting with synthetically-induced ones. But better not ask us what natural 

colours, for we can only think of leaf sap and rose petal juice!

Hogging Easter eggs and bunnies

Whoever thought the boring breakfast egg could be the stuff of so much fuss? While 

the eggs enjoy the brief pampering on Easter, you are not going to miss out on 

your yummy chocolate bunnies, are you? If you want to have more fun than that, 

why not try your painting skills on a few unsuspecting eggs? Tradition has it 

that colourful eggs were exchanged between lovers much like Valentine?s gifts? 

need we say more?

Catching Ray

Ray Charles fans just can?t afford to miss this one. A compelling performance 

by Jamie Foxx that won him the Best Actor Oscar for playing the legendary soul 

and R amp;B singer is reason enough to go watch Taylor Hackford?s Ray this 

week. And if you haven?t watched Black as yet, do so right away and empower 

yourself for the lengthy adda sessions this long weekend?

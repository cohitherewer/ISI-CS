 Focus on plastic surgery for kids

 PRASUN BHATTACHARYA

 With more and more children falling prey to congenital deformities, city hospitals are coming up with improved facilities to tap the multi-million-rupee market of paediatric plastic surgeries and stop people from heading South.

 ?In recent times, as many as 50 per cent of paediatric patients are coming with congenital diseases requiring plastic surgery. The percentage is increasing, prompting hospitals to develop comprehensive preparedness to tackle such patients,? said plastic surgeon Arun Ganguly.

 Among the most common congenital deformities are cleft chins, cleft palates, joined fingers or toes and absence of an ear.

 The market potential of paediatric surgeries for congenital deformities is around Rs 50 lakh a month, said Sathyanarayan Reddy, chief executive officer of Apollo Gleneagles Hospital.

 Reddy added that his hospital had recently invested around Rs 2.5 crore to modernise the plastic surgery unit. ?We are getting around 20 paediatric patients every month who require corrective surgery.?

 Apollo has set up a ?comprehensive? paediatric plastic surgery unit, being run by a 12-member team, including three surgeons. 

 ?You cannot sit idle when one in every 100 children is suffering from one congenital deformity or another,? said lead surgeon Gautham Basu.

 According to Association of Hospitals in Eastern India secretary Amit De, almost all corporate hospitals in the East are focussing on paediatric plastic surgeries. ?Huge investments are being made and they are trying to convince parents to treat their children here, instead of heading South.?

 Efforts have started bearing fruit, he claimed, as the number of South-bound patients has dropped by 20 per cent over the past six months.

 De, also chief executive officer of CMRI, said his hospital had invested around Rs 2.5 crore to upgrade its plastic surgery unit.

 Surgeon Ganguly pointed out that Bhagirathi Neotia Woman and Child Care Centre, the hospital he is attached with, has a ?comprehensive infrastructure? to perform paediatric plastic surgeries. ?Plans are afoot for further modernisation.?

 Reddy, of Apollo said all hospitals are laying special stress on anaesthetists. 

 ?Because of the lack of paediatric anaesthetists, paediatric surgeries were quite troublesome in Calcutta. But the situation has improved dramatically over the past couple of years,? he added.

 Explaining the necessity of expert paediatric anaesthetists, Ganguly said: ?The response time is very low when you are operating upon a child. A slightest mistake by an anaesthetist can prove disastrous.?

 The paediatric surgery teams at Apollo, CMRI and Bhagirathi Neotia each has on its rolls two ?specialised? paediatric anaesthetists.

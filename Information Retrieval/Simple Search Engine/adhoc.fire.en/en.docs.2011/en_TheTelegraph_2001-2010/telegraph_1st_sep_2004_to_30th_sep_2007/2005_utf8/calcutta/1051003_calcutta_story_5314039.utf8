 Maharaj menu for Marines

 - Food stop backed by Team India skipper bags US army catering contract

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 Sourav?s, the food stop on Park Street: American high

 He?s at loggerheads with an Australian. There?s no love lost between him and an Englishman. But he ? or at least the restaurant that proudly bears his name ? has scored with the Americans. After all, the Americans don?t play cricket.

 Sourav?s: The Food Pavilion on Park Street will be catering to the 250 military men who are coming down for joint war games with the Indian Air Force at the Kalaikunda airbase, near Kharagpur. The high-profile exercise starts on October 24 and ends on November 25. Sourav?s has bagged the contract to feed the American troops throughout their stay.

 ?The diet will be high on protein and fibre. There is a strong emphasis on health and hygiene, with Indian and Continental being served to for the entire month,? says a source at the food stop backed by the Team India skipper.

 Discipline ? probably a bad word to use at Sourav?s ever since the e-mail leak ? will be the byword in this crucial catering exercise. And the foreign hand is already at play, with two representatives from the health department of US Marines visiting Sourav?s on September 24. ?They inspected the property, kitchens and other infrastructure. They also held a workshop with the chefs. The entire staff has to be immunised against Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B and strict safety rules are to be followed,? said a source at the multi-speciality food address.

 The Food Pavilion will set up a makeshift kitchen at the airbase. More than 50 personnel will be deployed, including chefs and attendants, on a rotation basis. The provisions will be transported daily in refrigerated vans under specified temperature for various edibles. ?Meat will be imported from Australia and dairy products from New Zealand. The utensils and edibles will be washed with mineral water,? says the Sourav?s source.

 The daily menu has been drawn up. Breakfast: bacon, eggs, cereals, juices? Lunch: a range of biryanis, kebabs and dals, with naan and lachcha paratha, plus firni. Dinner: Continental. Will catering do for Maharaj what cricket hasn?t of late ? help him forge a healthy partnership with a foreign connection?

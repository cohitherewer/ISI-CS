The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 With no space to breathe

 - Reports stress need for lungs in urbanisation onslaught

 JAYANTA BASU

Why is the Maidan so precious to the city?

 For figures to speak the facts, try this. ?An important component of the open space of Calcutta is the Maidan, 620 hectares in area, situated almost at the centre of the city and working as the lungs of this dust-ridden metropolis. The Maidan alone covers more than 61 per cent of the total open space available for the city? ? Sustaining Calcutta: Present Status Report of the Urban Peoples Environment, published by Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) eight years ago.

 Or this. An expert committee of representatives from various Central and state government agencies submitted a report to the high court in June 2000, stating that ?organised open space in Calcutta is less than 1 per cent of the total area??.

 The minimum requirement, internationally, is 15 per cent. Calcutta offers an individual 21 sq ft of open space, against an international standard of 290 sq ft.

 The writing, thus, is on the sullied walls of a smoky city. With the Maidan accounting for more than 61 per cent of open space, there is no doubting its role as the lungs of Calcutta. 

 The CMDA report covering the erstwhile Calcutta Municipal Corporation area ? ward number 1 to 100 ? confirmed how open areas in the city were shrinking under the burden of urbanisation and put the importance of the Maidan into even sharper profile.

 ?With the population increase, availability of public open space has become a serious problem,? admits Hridaynanda Gupta, mayoral council member (parks and gardens). 

 ?The present civic board has increased the proportion of open space from 5 to 5.5 per cent. The Maidan, along with Rabindra Sarobar and the Park Circus ground, offer rare breathing spaces for the residents,? he adds.

 The experts? report belies claims of an increase in open space and observes how 23 wards have no recorded open space at all, while another 25 have less than one per cent, and hardly 10 have more than 10 per cent of open space.

 ?The green spread is vital to maintain the environmental balance,? says Tapas Ghatak of CMDA?s environment cell. 

 ?Don?t mess with the greens,? cries the green lobby, led by petitioner Subhas Dutta. 

 The Maidan, meanwhile, continues to be mauled and the city continues to gasp.

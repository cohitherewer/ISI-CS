The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bully rerun by MLA, target a boy 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Sanjay Bakshi: Slap-happy. A Telegraph picture

 Last April, he had beaten up a policeman who had ?dared? to stop his car for jumping the traffic lights.

 On Thursday, in a road-rage rerun, Trinamul Youth Congress president Sanjay Bakshi assaulted and grievously injured a Higher Secondary candidate, 18-year old Vivek Sharma. The boy is to write an exam on Friday.

 ?Vivek, a resident of Ultadanga Road, was headed towards Esplanade on a scooter around 2 pm, via CR Avenue. He was on the right side of the lane and a Hyundai Santro was on his left,? said Ranvir Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 ?At the CR Avenue-Muktaram Babu Street intersection, the Santro suddenly took a U-turn without any indication, causing the scooter to crash into it. Vivek fell and started protesting. Sanjay Bakshi emerged from the car and beat up the boy, before zooming off,? Kumar added.

 Traffic policemen deployed at the intersection came to the aid of Vivek, administered him first-aid and escorted him to Girish Park police station, where the teenager lodged an FIR against Bakshi.

 Vivek?s father R.K. Sharma, a doctor, alleged that the traffic policemen had not intervened when Bakshi was beating up his son. 

 ?Vivek was going to his teacher?s place and was riding pillion. When the Santro unexpectedly took a U-turn, the scooter stopped, but a three-wheeler dashed it from behind, hurtling it against the car. Bakshi got out and there was an altercation. Bakshi grabbed Vivek by the neck, punched him several times, then threw him to the ground, before kicking him in the stomach,? Sharma claimed.

 When his son contacted him from Girish Park police station around 5 pm, Sharma rushed there. He found police dilly-dallying over the formalities. ?They asked me if I was sure I wanted to pursue the case legally, and I answered in the affirmative. No one is above the law,? he said. 

 Bakshi alleged that the ?public? had assaulted Vivek.

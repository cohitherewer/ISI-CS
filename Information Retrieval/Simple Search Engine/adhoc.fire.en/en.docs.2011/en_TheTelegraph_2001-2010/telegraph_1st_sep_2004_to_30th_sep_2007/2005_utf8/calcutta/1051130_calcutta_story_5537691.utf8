 Low-price lifeline for halls

 Today?s question: Are multiplexes killing single-screen theatres?

 Viewers rsquo; choice: A platter on offer, on a screen of choice

 Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

 Behala

 Multiplexes will not be able to kill single-screen theatres in the near future. People who are not rich want their pick of movies without spending much, which is only possible at the halls. Viewers are also reluctant to travel too far to watch a film, but most localities do not have a multiplex.

 Satyen Biswas, 

 Behala

 Only people more concerned about luxury than about the film they are watching visit multiplexes. Single-screen theatres will never die.

 Dalim Kumar Dutta, 

 APC Roy Road

 Multiplexes all over the country charge higher admission rates than single-screen theatres. The multiplexes have not reduced their ticket prices since they are attracting an adequate number of patrons. The food sold at multiplexes is also priced exorbitantly, but that does not stop people from digging in. 

K.B. Goswami,

 Central Park 

 Multiplexes might not be killing single-screen theatres, but are certainly making their survival difficult. The ticket prices at multiplexes make it impossible for middle-class and low-income group families to frequent them. Halls with decent facilities, when they screen good movies, still attract a lot of people, even for late-night shows.

Subho Bhattacharya, 

 Deb Lane

 Single-screen theatres are failing to counter the growing influence of multiplexes and they have only themselves to blame. Poor sitting arrangement and bad projection system have led to their downfall. On their part, multiplexes need to lower ticket prices to attract all sections of people.

 Subhankar Mukherjee,

 Borehat, Burdwan

 Multiplexes and single-screens have different customer profile. With more multiplexes opening, their ticket prices are bound to decrease, thus attracting more middle-class people. The only advantage single-screen theatres now enjoy will thus disappear. However, it is television which poses the biggest threat to halls.

 Govind Das Dujari,

 Diamond Harbour Road 

 Single-screen theatres are digging their own grave. The government can help them convert to multiplexes on the condition that the ticket prices cannot be increased beyond a certain level. Petty criminals like to spend time watching movies and can only afford low-priced tickets. With the halls closing down, they have become more involved with crime. Isn?t it best to keep them confined to the comforts of an affordable multiplex for three hours? They are likely to spend another hour or so discussing the movie. This will lower the crime rate.

 Swarnali Biswas,

 Address not given

 Multiplexes have adversely affected the single-screen theatres. To protect the halls, the government should make it mandatory for multiplexes to price their tickets higher. There could also be a bar on multiplexes being set up within the city. 

 Rajib Dey,

 Habra

 Certainly not. The majority still makes decisions with one eye on the price. Single-screen theatres are their staple source of entertainment.

 Kalyan Ghosh,

 Park Street

 This is a misconception. The majority still prefers the single-screen theatres. Halls have closed down only because of internal problems. Single-screen theatres can co-exist with multiplexes.

 A.K. Mitra,

 Pudda Pukur Road

 If that was the case, multiplexes would have outnumbered single-screen theatres. Most people now prefer to watch movies at home.

 Sukanta Pachal,

 Howrah

 Multiplexes are for the rich and the show-offs. They are affecting the business of single-screen theatres but will not replace them as long as there is a difference in ticket prices.

 Bhupen Bose,

 Dum Dum

 People from low and middle-income groups still prefer well-maintained halls. However, multiplexes will gradually lure away viewers.

 Arpita Chowdhury, 

 East Sinthee Road

 Only the affluent can afford multiplexes. The halls are languishing even then because of internal problems.

 Samyak Nandy,

 Bangur Avenue

 Multiplexes are stealing the show because they are comfortable, clean and customer-friendly. They might have initially targeted the rich, but are now bringing down ticket prices. It should not be long before they become the preferred movie-watching destination for everyone.

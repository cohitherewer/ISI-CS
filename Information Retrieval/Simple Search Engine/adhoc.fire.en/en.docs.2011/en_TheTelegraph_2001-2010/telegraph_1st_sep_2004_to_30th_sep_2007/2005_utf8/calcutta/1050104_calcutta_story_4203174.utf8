The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bow-out boon for civic coffers

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 For the past five years, the civic authorities had been relentless in their efforts, albeit in vain, to pare down the workforce and put a brake on a galloping wage bill. 

 The objective will be realised to a great extent in 2005. According to officials in the civic personnel department, around 5,000 employees will retire by the Pujas. 

 Translated into monetary terms, it means the civic body will save around Rs 50 crore a year. (The number of civic employees to have retired in the past five years is little more than 6,000.)

 Despite the good news, mayor Subrata Mukherjee?s brows are creased, as he finds himself saddled with the consequences of his own acts almost 30 years ago.

 Mukherjee, who had cautiously avoided political recruitment during his five-year tenure, will have to disburse a record amount of retirement benefits by April to several thousand ?word-of-mouth? civic employees. 

 Most of those retiring this year were recruited on political grounds by Mukherjee himself, when he was municipal affairs minister in the S.S. Ray government.

 ?It?s a penance for me to be the mayor when my own recruits are retiring. If I had known that I would have to disburse their retirement benefits, I would not have been so careless in recruiting them,? Mukherjee told Metro on Sunday.

 He, however, claimed that the Congress alone could not be blamed for the civic body?s bloated staff strength. ?Till the last Left Front board was ousted in 2000, the Corporation had always been the city?s biggest asylum for political workers,? Mukherjee asserted. 

 According to him, recruitment on political considerations had roughly been the same (20,000) in the 60s and the 70s (when the Congress was in power in the state) and during the Left Front regime. 

 The trend, he pointed out, was arrested only after the Trinamul-BJP alliance wrested the civic board in 2000.

 ?When we took over, the civic body had 45,000 employees. The annual salary bill had exceeded the revenue earnings by Rs 66 crore,? Mukherjee explained. 

 In 2000, the tax collection was Rs 170 crore, while the amount spent on the 45,000-odd employees was a staggering Rs 236 crore.

 Mukherjee is the only mayor, since the institution of the mayor?s court under a Royal Charter in 1727, credited with achieving a revenue surplus. 

 With the civic polls a few months away, pressure has been mounting on Mukherjee to start recruiting people from the Trinamul ranks. Among those favouring the idea are a few mayoral council members as well. 

 But Mukherjee is adamant. ?The CPM may rule the board for the next 100 years, but so long as I am in power, I will not allow political recruitment,? he signed off.

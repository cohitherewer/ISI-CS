The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Pre-Puja flight sops

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Fly to Krabi and Chiang Mai, or take a longer flight to Sydney and Zurich at slashed air fares this September. Or, en route to a distant destination, stop for a ?free stay? in Kuala Lumpur.

 The season of low fares and special schemes is not quite over yet. September Surprise from Thai Airways is set to woo the city pre-Pujas. Valid all next month, Calcuttans will be poorer by only Rs 7,300 for a round trip to Bangkok, instead of the existing fare of Rs 9,000-plus. 

 ?For some time now, we have been planning to come up with a pre-Puja gift for Calcutta, and we thought what could be better than offering attractive fares to the holiday-loving Calcuttan,? said Krisnapong Srisinwarakool, general manager (Calcutta), Thai Airways.

 Other international airlines in the city have slashed fares several times in recent months, but this is a first for Thai Airways. ?We have carefully analysed all the most frequently-visited places by Calcuttans and slashed the fares on those sectors. And the fares are applicable for two persons, not just one,? added Srisinwarakool.

 Locations like Pattaya and Phuket have always been on top of the list for Calcuttans and in post-tsunami times, other exotic locations like Krabi have been projected as alternative holiday hotspots, said S.C. Kapoor, district sales manager (Calcutta), Thai Airways.

 Singapore or Jakarta, Australia, Europe and Southeast Asia are on the fare-slash list (see box) for the airlines. ?We are giving Calcuttans a huge range of fares and destinations to choose from. In future, we will come up with similar fares,? added Srisinwarakool.

 If Thai Airways is busy slashing fares, Malaysia Airlines has come up with the Showcase Malaysia 2005 offer. From September 1 to December 12, any passenger travelling beyond Malaysia to other destinations will be entitled to three nights? free stay in one of eight locations in the country.

 Other airlines, too, are making plans. ?We are reviewing our fares and will come up with an appropriate answer,? quipped Bharath Mahadevan, manager (east), Singapore Airlines.

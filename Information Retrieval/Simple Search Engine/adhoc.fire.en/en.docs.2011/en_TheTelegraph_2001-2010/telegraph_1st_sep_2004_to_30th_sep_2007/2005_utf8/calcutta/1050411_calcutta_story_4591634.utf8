Ethnic chic rules up-market racks

ZEESHAN JAWED

 Till a couple of years ago, a 2,800-sq-ft showroom dedicated to traditional men?s wear in an up-market mall was unthinkable. But with increasing number of people making kurtas their second skin, the designs have gone from plain to popular. 

 Gatha in City Centre is one example of a kurta store going places. The brand?s first outlet was at Forum but it does not match its Salt Lake sister in size or stock.

 Casual or ornate, embellished or embroidered, at Gatha, men are likely to lay their hands on just about any kurta they need. ?Kurtas have defined the look of the season. Comfort levels, exposure and good designs have made kurtas popular,? says Raju Dugar, owner, Gatha.

One of a kind

 Besides the usual cotton, silk and khadi, Gatha uses Italian crepe and jamavar for the heavier variety. ?Such fabrics are hardly used for kurtas by anybody in town. And this is what decides our prices,? explains Dugar. The fancier variety costs anything between Rs 4,000 and Rs 25,000. 

 ?The designs once made are never repeated. This ensures exclusivity,? says Dugar. The latest stock in the summer collection features kurtas in shades of rust, maroon and blue, embroidered with brocade and jamavar.

 Marriages are responsible for brisk sale of traditional wear. ?Previously a wedding would be over in a couple of days. But now a marriage often continues for weeks and people like to have a new outfit each day. They also experiment with fabrics and weaves,? adds Dugar.

Cool comfort

 With the April sun shining brightly overhead, there could be nothing as cool and comforting as linen. ?Some customers nowadays prefer to sleep in kurtas. For this purpose, we have light, transparent and comfortable options,? says Raju. These are available in vegetable dyes, natural khadi and denims. The weaves are basic with little embroidery. They cost between Rs 500 and Rs 1,500.

short option

 After a number of years in style, kurtis refuse to fade out. Linen and linen blends are used for these, available in solid colours, checks and stripes. A smattering for women is also available in this category. The prices for this casual crop are between Rs 395 and Rs 1,250.

add ons

 Stoles are the latest fad, and Gatha has a fair lot to choose from. The long dupattas are available in fabrics like silk, silk blends, crepe and net. They come in a range of colours and can be coordinated with the kurta. A stole also ups the price tag of the emsemble, starting at Rs 300 and going up to Rs 2,000.

 You can also find the juti of your choice or of the same colour as your kurta. The uppers are made of handmade fabrics and fixed to rubber soles, putting you back by another Rs 295 to Rs 795.

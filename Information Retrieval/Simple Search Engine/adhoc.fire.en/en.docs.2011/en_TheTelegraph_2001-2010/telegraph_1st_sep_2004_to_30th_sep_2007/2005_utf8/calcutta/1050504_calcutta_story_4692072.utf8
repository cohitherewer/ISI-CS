 Carpenter grilled in murder

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Dipti D?Cruz was hit on her head at least 10 to 12 times with a rod as well as a sharp instrument on Sunday, before she slumped and suffered a severe head injury, resulting in her death, a preliminary post-mortem report suggests. 

 The two-hour-long post-mortem, carried out at NRS Medical College on Tuesday afternoon, also revealed that the 48-year-old widow was murdered between 8 pm and 10 pm on Sunday by more than one assailant. 

 The killers were familiar with the layout of the house in Patra Lane where she lived. Before delivering the final blow, the assailants had hit her so hard that she suffered a fracture in her left ribs. 

 While still in the dark about the motive, police are questioning Sheikh Saifuddin, a carpenter known to the family for years. Late on Monday, a team of officers went to Saifuddin?s home at Arambagh, in Hooghly, and picked him up for interrogation. On Tuesday evening, a hunt was launched for Md Ismail Khan, an accomplice of Saifuddin?s. 

 ?Saifuddin had recently persuaded the lady to buy a bakery in the Taltala area but failed to deliver the relevant documents. The lady trusted him to the extent that she had handed over a few gold ornaments to Saifuddin for his wife so that she could wear these on a social occasion. Even these were not returned,? said a senior police officer. 

 Irritated, Dipti had asked the man to meet her last Friday but he didn?t turn up. 

 Forensic experts, who visited the house during the day, said it was a murder in cold blood. ?After the act, the assailants washed their hands with soap, dried themselves with a towel and moved out,? said a senior member of the team. Police claimed the assailants had removed the rods possibly used to kill Dipti. 

 Earlier in the day Dipti?s son Saroj, studying medicine at Katihar, arrived from Bangalore, where he is doing his internship. Police took him around the narrow lane and single-storeyed house where his mother had lived for the past six years. Carpenters had worked at their home and medicine store on several occasions, a neighbour said.

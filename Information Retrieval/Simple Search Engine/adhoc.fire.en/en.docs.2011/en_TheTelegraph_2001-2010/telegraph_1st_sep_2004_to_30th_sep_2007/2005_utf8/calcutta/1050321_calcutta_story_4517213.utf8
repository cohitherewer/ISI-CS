 Blinkered view of butchers on footpath

 Soumya Halder: Traders are often seen selling meat on the footpath near the Central Blood Bank. They even butcher chicken on the footpath, which is quite gory. Why can?t you evict them? The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) evicted them from the footpaths, but there were no follow-up operations, and they are back in business.

 The people who operate from the footpath sell meat without any licence. This practice was earlier prevalent in some parts of the city that do not fall under my jurisdiction. I have received several complaints in the past few months regarding selling of meat in the Maniktala area. I will definitely look into the matter. Sometimes, police officers ignore these offensive activities though they are fully aware that selling meat and butchering animals in full public view is not legal. The CMC had arranged for a mass awareness campaign against selling and butchering of chicken in the open, but they never sought our help to remove the traders. If the CMC launches an eviction drive aimed at these illegal traders, and asks for our help, we will definitely come forward to stop this practice. We will also look into the matter on our own.

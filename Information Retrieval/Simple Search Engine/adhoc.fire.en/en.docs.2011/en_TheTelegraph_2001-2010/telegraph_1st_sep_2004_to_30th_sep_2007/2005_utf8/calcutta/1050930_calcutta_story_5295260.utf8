 Is it a leading US brand seeking out Bengal or a leading Bangla band going global? This October, denim enters a new domain as jeans major Levis ropes in Bangla rock band Chandrabindoo as its official style partner.

 The tie-up comes just days ahead of the bands US tour in early October, when Chandrabindoo will perform in Philadelphia, New Jersey, Atlanta, Houston, Dallas and San Jose.

 For the more-than-150-year-old brand, its part of Levis ongoing effort to link itself to rock music and youth.

 Levis is a brand for the youth. It is as original, exciting and unpredictable as they are. The brand has adapted itself to all generations of youth and culture, says Shumone Chatterjee, country manager, Levi Strauss India Private Limited.

 The brand has always promoted music in a big way and we will be the style partners of Chandrabindoo on their America tour. Levis will sponsor the merchandise used during the concert. Moreover, we will be selling Chandrabindoo merchandise in all our outlets in Calcutta, he reveals.

 The activity will continue next summer when there are concerts in Calcutta colleges. Before Puja 2006, there will be a six-city tour. The popularity of Bangla bands is increasing by leaps and bounds among the Bengali youth. We are using the band to project our brand as one that speaks their language and adapts their culture, says Chatterjee.

 Chandrabindoo, too, is excited about the tie-up. An initiative like this is definitely going to raise the standard. The association with Levis also gives us an opportunity to project ourselves as a national entity, feels Upal of Chandrabindoo.

 But hasnt the tie-up come a little late with the Bangla band boom having already happened? Yes, I agree that the boom happened a couple of years back, but then the market in Calcutta wasnt a mature one. Jeans shared racks with other garments. But now we have sprawling stores exclusively for our brand. The city has become so fashion conscious! For Levis, this is the best time to enter into tie-ups, says Chatterjee. 

 Chandrabindoo was chosen for its versatility and popularity. They are the best rock band in the state with 10 albums and lots of adulation. They are involved with various genres of rock as well as other kinds of music. Moreover, their words strike a chord with everyone. As the name suggests, they strive for the ultimate, feels Chatterjee. 

 Moon menu

 Various anecdotes surround the emergence of this festival. Chef Rajesh Dubey of Mainland narrated one of the more authentic ones: When China was ruled by the Yuan dynasty, rebels opposing the Mongolian rule exchanged messages neatly packed inside moon cakes. The night the rebels successfully overthrew the foreign yoke came to be known as the autumn moon night and hence we have the Autumn Moon Festival.

 The soup selection includes Pineapple and Seafood Sour Soup, Pineapple Corn and Vegetables Sour Soup and Garlic Flavoured Pepper Mushroom Soup.

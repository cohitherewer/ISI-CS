 Do you use your phone more to shoot aliens and race past the chequered flag than to make calls? And do you manage top scores in the process? 

 Then, this could be the chance to put those quick moves to the test at the Olympics of virtual gaming.

 With the boom in games played on the move in mind, World Mobile Gaming Championships has included a segment on mobile gaming this year. And four contestants from India will get the chance to match their skills against the rest of the world at the tournament, to be held in Singapore between November 16 and 20.

 The contest, however, is open only to those on the Airtel network, which is the partnering cellular service provider for India.

 ?Users can register and download any of the four games of the World Mobile Gaming Championships at our Airtel Live! section,? said Mohit Bhatnagar, senior vice-president of Bharti Tele-Ventures. ?They can play the games and submit the scores by October 31.?

 The top-scorer in each title ? Bruce Lee, Chopper Rescue, Goolie and Microsoft Midtown Madness 3 ? will be eligible to represent India at the gaming spectacle.

 Airtel is launching the contest in phases and has already seen 20,000 registrations so far. After Delhi and Mumbai, the promotions kick-start in Calcutta from Friday. 

 ?A mobile van will travel across the city, demonstrating the games. People can play a game for free on the spot,? said an Airtel spokesperson.

 Cybercafes and college campuses are also being targeted to spread the word. The base of mobile gamers is still quite small in the country and the cellular service provider feels efforts like these will help boost interest in the genre. 

 Airtel estimates around two lakh active mobile gamers in India, but expects the current Rs 45-crore market to grow to Rs 200 crore by 2007. 

 ?In Calcutta, two per cent of our GPRS base is into mobile gaming,? said the spokesperson.

 Handset compatibility is a key issue for the slow growth. ?My handset does not support many of the games that I?d like to play,? cribs Amit Poddar, a casual gamer in Calcutta.

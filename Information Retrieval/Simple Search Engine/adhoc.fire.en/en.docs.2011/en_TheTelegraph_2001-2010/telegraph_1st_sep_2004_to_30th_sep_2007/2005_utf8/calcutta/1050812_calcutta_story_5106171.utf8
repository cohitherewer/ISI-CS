The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Small screen, big blitz

 Aamir Khan with MTV veejays Sophie and Cyrus, and (below) with Johnny Bravo

 It?s time for all to rise and tune in. Mangal Pandey is taking the beam battle to new heights. And his only competition is television history. While all the channels are chanting the Mangala mangala mantra, Mangal Pandey ? The Rising has tied up with three major satellite addresses in a bid to arrest eyeballs. 

 ?In today?s media-noisy world, communication has become a challenge. This (tie-up with channels) is one way to focus attention on a project,? director Ketan Mehta states. 

 In the run-up to the mutinous Friday, viewers are sharing behind-the-scenes action on Cartoon Network and Pogo. Teenage Prime Pogo hosts, Niall and Chinu, are interacting with Khan (minus the Mangal moustache) as he narrates on-the-sets anecdotes. And what?s Cartoon Network minus its animated heroes? So there?s resident cool dude Johnny Bravo chatting up Khan every day between shows till August 15. ?How do you memorise your lines??asks Johnny in chaste Hindi. ?I copy them down in my own hand,? replies Khan. These interstitials will be woven together for a special show, airing at 4.30 pm on August 15. 

 MTV, too, is going full blast on Independence Day, giving 16 hours of beam time to the movie. ?The film is not just about Mangal Pandey and mutiny, but about freedom. So we are giving you freedom from advertisements from 8 am to midnight,? says Ashish Patil, vice-president, creative and content, MTV Networks India. The no-ads exercise is a first in the channel?s history. 

 MTV has shot 200 hours of behind-the-scenes footage. Add to that capsules on the rise of each of the stars. ?In Aamir Khan: Rising, we will show him taking the first step in films with Yaadon Ki Baraat and then playing a supporting role to Ashutosh Gowariker?s lead in Ketan Mehta?s Holi. He speaks of the times just after Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak released, pleading with autowallahs to put on the film?s stickers and being rebuffed.? Similar ?Rising? segments have been prepared for the other stars.

 Instead of the usual 90-second clips, the channel will be beaming full songs. Trivia will be shared through the day on the British regime. 

 For Mehta, having an MTV camera rolling behind his own didn?t really matter. ?On an average day, there were 200 people on the sets; on the days of the battle scenes, there were 5,000. So a few more people hardly made a difference.?

 Would the small-screen blitz be an overkill? ?It would whet their appetite. On the big screen, it is just bigger, better and much more intense,? argues Mehta.

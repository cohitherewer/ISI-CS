The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

?Switching genres is tough but challenging?

Multiplicity man JOHN ABRAHAM is flirting with 

blood and gore, family drama and comedy. He talks to Pratim D. Gupta about 

role-playing, co-star Priyanka Chopra, the Kaal capers and missing out on Dhoom

in Karam 

Karam has met with a mixed response at the 

box-office?

Yes, the film has received different kinds of reactions 

but everyone?s been very supportive of my performance in the film. So Karam 

hasn?t been a losing proposition for me. 

 Was it stylistically too slick for the greater 

Indian audience?

I think Karam is a reflection of the vision 

of the film?s director Sanjay F. Gupta. He loves the black-and-white images, the 

shades. There is a lot of ambiguity in the film. For me, it has been a very different, 

very deep movie. To like the film, one has to understand Sanjay?s kind of cinema. 

I think he has done a very good job as a first-time director.

 Your pairing with Priyanka Chopra is being talked 

and written about a lot. What was it like working with her?

She is very professional and a very co-operative co-actor. 

Priyanka is also a good actress.

 It?s all Kaal now?

Yes. Kaal is a great flick and it has great 

actors in it like Ajay Devgan and Vivek Oberoi. I got to learn so many things 

from the two of them. It?s also a lovely way to get to work with co-producers 

Karan Johar and Shah Rukh Khan.

Kaal is a movie about jungles and it was great 

to get familiarised with such forest terrain. The teasers have met with a very 

positive response.

 But what about these wildlife groups moving court 

alleging that the Kaal team has violated the rules?

We aren?t really concerned about those allegations 

and charges. We are all animal lovers. And we are trying to conserve wildlife 

and forests through our film. We have even tied up with National Geographic for 

the film ? what more credibility of our intentions than that?

 How has life changed after Dhoom?

At the end of the day, Dhoom is just another 

film. I have to continue to do good work and do that consistently. I have a long 

way to go.

 Any regrets of not being considered for Dhoom 

2?

No regrets whatsoever. I am happy with my performance 

in Dhoom and that the people appreciated it. If the producers do not want 

me to be a part of the sequel, I am okay with it.

 With Priyadarshan?s Garam Masala, you are 

venturing into comedy for the first time...

It?s an absolute laugh riot. I am currently shooting 

for the film, which also stars Paresh Rawal, Akshay Kumar and Rajpal Yadav. And 

let me tell you, comedy is very tough. It took me three days to just learn the 

ropes. I have been receiving a lot of support from all my co-actors, helping me 

grasp the role better.

 You have also bagged Ravi Chopra?s Babul with 

Amitabh Bachchan, Rani Mukherjee and Salman Khan?

Rani plays Amitabh Bachchan?s daughter-in-law, Salman 

plays the son and I play Rani?s best friend in the film. You can also say I play 

the other man in the movie.

 From negative characters to comedy to drama, you 

are doing everything under the sun. How difficult is it switching genres?

Yes, once I shoot for Babul, which is a family 

drama, it will be like a full circle for me in one year. For a newcomer like me, 

it?s very tough to switch from one mode to another. But it?s challenging too. 

And it?s always good fun.

 What other films will we see John Abraham in?

There?s Deepa Mehta?s River Moon with Lisa 

Ray. Then there?s Mahesh Manjrekar?s Viruddh or Versus alongside 

Amitabh Bachchan and Sharmila Tagore ? I have just five days of shooting left 

for the film. I am also slated to do Milan Luthria?s next film with Nana Patekar, 

which is yet to be titled and will be produced by Ramesh Sippy.

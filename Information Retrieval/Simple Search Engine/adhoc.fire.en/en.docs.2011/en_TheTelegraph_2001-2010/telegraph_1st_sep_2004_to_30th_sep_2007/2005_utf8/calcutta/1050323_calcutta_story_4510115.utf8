The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Tryst with trees in July 

 TAMAL SENGUPTA

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will inaugurate the largest ever afforestation project for Calcutta in July. 

 The state government has recently cleared a Rs 2.78-crore action plan for the greening of Calcutta. The forest department, which has drawn up the plan, has adopted the Delhi model. A similar green drive was executed in the Capital five years ago.

 The government has also decided to set up a standing committee on the Calcutta Bio-Aesthetic Plan, which will be headed by the chief minister himself. 

 The other members are the ministers for urban development, environment and forests and mayor Subrata Mukherjee, said forest minister Jogesh Burman. 

 The member-secretary of the West Bengal Pollution Control Board will be included in the committee. The chief secretary will function as the convener, Burman added.

 A ?tree helpline? will be set up at the forest department?s headquarters, so people can phone in and record official complaints about unauthorised felling of trees.

 The forest department is to supply about 2.75 lakh saplings, which will be planted across Calcutta over the next three years. Minister Burman hopes to transform Calcutta into a city of gardens, like Bangalore, by then.

 Sixty-seven roads have been identified, on which 20,000 saplings ? of flowering trees, shrubs and creepers ? will be planted.

 Artificial forests will come up on the approach roads to Vidyasagar Setu, the areas between Strand Road and Fort William opposite Prinsep Ghat, and in pockets of Brigade Parade Ground. AJC Bose Road and Southern Avenue will have pavement gardens and tree-lined boulevards.

 The need for a greener Calcutta was driven by a recent CMDA report, which stated that green space in Calcutta was about 0.2 hectare per 1,000 people, against the international standard of 1.6 hectare per 1,000 people.

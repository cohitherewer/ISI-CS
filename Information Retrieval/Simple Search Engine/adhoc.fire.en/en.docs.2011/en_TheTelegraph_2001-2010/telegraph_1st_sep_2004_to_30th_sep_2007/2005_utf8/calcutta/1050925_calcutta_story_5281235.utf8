The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Next weekend you can be at ... 

Pelling

 The first rays of the sun, having painted the eastern sky crimson, are slowly spreading on the peaks of the mountain ranges that straddle the horizon. The Kanchenjungha, her snowy crown sparkling gloriously, stands out, like a queen presiding over her subjects.

 That is a typical morning at Pelling, far, far away from the dust and din of the city. Each and every hotel room here is a room with a view.

 For those who haven?t already heard of the charms of Pelling, it is a small town in western Sikkim tucked away in the folds of the Shivaliks. A long drive from Siliguri, along the Teesta in torrent, willget you here. There are options aplenty to reach Siliguri from Calcutta, an overnight bus or train being the best. One can also fly to Bagdogra. 

 Nature has endowed Pelling with a generous bounty. Snow-capped peaks, verdant greenery and deep blue sky will take your breath away as soon as you reach the town.

 It is also a birdwatcher?s paradise. With a handbook of Himalayan birds and a pair of binoculars, even an amateur can embark on an ornithological journey. In no time, one will come across hundreds of avian specimens of various hues and delightful names like Fire-breasted Flowerpecker and Grey-hooded Warbler.

 The sights and sounds are not limited to the world of nature. Pelling has as much to offer to the historically or spiritually inclined.

 Pemayangtse, one of the oldest and perhaps the most important Buddhist monastery in Sikkim, is half-an-hour by car. It houses numerous antique idols, paintings and sculptures. One can witness the dance of the monks during the annual festival in February. 

 Thirty km from Pelling is the Kecheopari Lake. Surrounded by colourful prayer flags that disappear into thick virgin forests, this high-altitude lake is divine to both the devout and the nature-worshipper.

 Lamas in red robes with ?om mani padme hum? on their lips sit and spin prayer wheels around the lake. Hindu priests are also around as the place is sacred to them as well.

 Colourful birds offer a pleasant contrast to the clear, tranquil water of the lake. Locals believe that the birds keep the waterbody clear of the leaves that fall from the trees on its banks. 

 A weekend to Pelling will remain incomplete without a glimpse of local life. A trip to the neighbouring villages, populated by ever-smiling, hardworking Lepchas, is a must. 

 The town itself is a gourmet?s delight. From aloo posto and momo to pakoras and chicken tandoori, the tiny eateries that dot the hill station offer a wide spread, even for the urban visitor. 

 To soothe frayed city nerves, try Pelling this Puja. It could well be your most memorable getaway.

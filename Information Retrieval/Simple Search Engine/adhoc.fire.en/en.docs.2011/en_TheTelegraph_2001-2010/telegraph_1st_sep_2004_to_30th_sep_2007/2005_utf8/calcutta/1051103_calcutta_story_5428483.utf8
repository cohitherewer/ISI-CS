 While large chunks of the city remained relatively noise-free on Tuesday, pockets, mainly in south Calcutta, erupted with the sound of crackers as the evening wore on, in clear defiance of the directives of Supreme Court and West Bengal Pollution Control Board.

 ?We received about 60 complaints, mainly from south Calcutta, and decided to start proceedings against 15 persons,? stated board chairman Sudip Banerjee.

 State-run hospitals, supposed to be silence zones, and parts of Ballygunge Circular Road and Dover Road were among the areas worst affected. A special monitoring team of the board, consisting of senior law officer Biswajit Mukherjee, who is also a high court-appointed special officer for noise pollution control, senior scientist Ujjal Mukherjee and environmental engineer Amitava Banerjee made the rounds. I accompanied the team.

 Stop 1, 6.10 pm, SSKM Hospital: The Friends Association, formed by the hospital employees and their relatives, in a clear violation of the norms, is playing music through two giant speakers. There is a permanent police outpost on the premises, but the cops arrive on the scene only after 45 minutes. 

 The speakers, cassettes and the subscription receipt books are confiscated and the secretary of the puja detained. Crackers were burst with impunity in all parts of the hospital.

 Stop 2, 7.20 pm, NRS Hospital: The sound of crackers greets the team. Police are nowhere to be found, as the members of NRS Employees Residential Recreation Club lead the noisy revelry. ?Patients are the most vulnerable and we should first try to give them respite, yet?? wonders Biswajit Mukherjee.

 Stop 3, 8.10 pm, Medical College and Hospital: Like any other evening, with hardly a sound of cracker, not only on the compound, but also in the surrounding areas. 

 Stop 4, 9.15 pm, Howrah Zilla Hospital: Youth Club, an organisation of Group D employees, is playing chartbusters at ear-splitting volumes a stone?s throw from Howrah police station. Microphone and speakers are confiscated and four people handed over to the cops. Hospital superintendent Subhrangsu Chakrabarty says microphone was used in defiance of his instructions.

 Stop 5, 11.15 pm, Ballygunge Circular Road and Dover Road: The smell of sulphur, a cloud of haze and thunderous sounds usher us into the area. Crackers are being burst uninterrupted behind the closed gates of multi-storeyed buildings. Five estates on Ballygunge Circular Road ? 60/1, 29/A, 59, 56/2 and 57B ? and 1, Dover Park are booked by the board officials. Police detain at least six persons. 

 ?The area is clearly the worst of the lot and unfortunately, the educated and socially-established people are at fault,? says Biswajit Mukherjee. Another estate, 14/105, Uday Shankar Sarani, in the Golf Club area, is also booked. 

 Stop 6, 12.30 pm, National Medical College: Both the hospital as well as its surroundings is largely noise-free.

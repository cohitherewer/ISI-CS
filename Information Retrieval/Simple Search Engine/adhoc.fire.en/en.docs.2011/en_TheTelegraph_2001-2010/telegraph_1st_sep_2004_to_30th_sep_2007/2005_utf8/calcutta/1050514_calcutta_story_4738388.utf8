 The mummy returns

 The Tutankhamun 

 mummy being scanned 

 Was the world?s most celebrated pharaoh a victim of foul play? How exactly did he die? The 3,000-year-old murder mystery has finally been solved and you can find out just how when National Geographic Channel premieres King Tut?s Curse on Sunday night.

 King Tutankhamun has been the object of curiosity ever since the discovery of his tomb in 1922. His mysterious death and the ?curse? on those involved in the discovery have only added to the intrigue.

 Now, National Geographic Channel reveals startling new findings related to the boy king as it follows archaeologist Dr Zahi Hawass and a team of international scientists ? radiologists, epidemiologists and forensic pathologists ? on their search trail.

 For the first time in over 25 years, the mummy is removed from its sarcophagus for a detailed forensic investigation using revolutionary CT-scan imaging. 

 ?CT technology enables us to virtually ?unwrap? the mummies without damaging them,? explains Hawass, the secretary general of Egypt?s Supreme Council of Antiquities. The CT scan takes multiple high-resolution 3-D images, including cross-section views of his bones, skull and teeth.

 The scanning of King Tut?s mummy is part of a five-year Egyptian research and conservation project, aimed at conserving and studying the ancient mummies of Egypt.

 Dr Hawass and his team hit the headlines this week when they released images of a reconstructed face of Tutankhamun. 

 The scan took place on January 5, 2005, in the Valley of the Kings in Luxor. The fragile body of the king, which had remained undisturbed since it was last X-rayed in 1978, was carefully carried to the scanner inside the wooden tray of sand. The CT scan was able, with minimum disturbance of the mummy, to distinguish different densities of soft tissue and bone. During the scan, over 1,700 high-resolution images were captured which were then used to create three-dimensional models, both virtual and actual.

 The scientific team concluded that Tutankhamun was about 19 when he died. He was well-fed and showed no signs of childhood diseases or malnutrition. The team found no signs of a blow to the head, as had been theorised based on X-rays taken in 1968, and no other evidence of foul play. 

 They did note a bad fracture just above the left knee that may have occurred a day or two before the king died. ?It is possible that this injury became infected and killed the king,? says team leader Hawass.

 The project will continue with the inventory of the non-royal mummies in Egypt and the final stage will be the scanning of the royal mummies now exhibited at the Cairo Museum. Catch the two-hour special directed by Brando Quilici and produced by National Geographic Television and Film on May 15, 9 pm.

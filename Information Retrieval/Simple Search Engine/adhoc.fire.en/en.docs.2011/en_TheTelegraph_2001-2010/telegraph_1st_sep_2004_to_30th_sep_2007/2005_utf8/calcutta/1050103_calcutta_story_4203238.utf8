 Marks forgery rerun at CU

 - Sleuths called in to probe fresh fraud in B.Sc marksheet

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Before the dust could settle on the Mukti Deb case, Calcutta University (CU) has landed itself in a new marksheet controversy ? this time involving a postgraduate student.

 Mukti Deb, a teacher of Visva-Bharati University, was arrested after she was found to have tampered with her B.Sc marksheet to get herself admitted in a postgraduate course in Jadavpur University.

 The student in question had taken admission in CU?s M.Sc course in radio physics last August on the strength of a forged marksheet of the university?s B.Sc Part I and Part II examinations. 

 The marksheet the student had produced showed aggregate marks that were 125 more than what he had actually obtained in his B.Sc (physics honours) Part I and Part II.

 The student, an examinee of the university?s B.Sc Part I and II from Ranaghat College, in Nadia, had scored 351 out of a total of 800 in his physics honours papers. 

 The marks were inadequate for him to get admission in the university?s M.Sc course in radio physics. 

 To secure a seat, he allegedly approached a person running a local coaching centre and managed to get a fake marksheet in which his tally in all his eight honours papers was increased and the aggregate touched 476.

 Officials said the student had confessed in a letter that he had paid Rs 25,000 to the coaching centre for supplying him the forged marksheet with extra marks. 

 ?Smelling a rat, we contacted the university?s examinations department. After running a check, it was found that the student had scored 351 and not 476,? said a teacher in the radio physics department.

 The forged marksheet showing the total as 476 looked exactly like the original one. The roll and the registration numbers of the student were found to be genuine. 

 A copy of the marksheet attached to the admission form ? a formality that is a must during admission ? was apparently attested by the principal of his college.

 The university authorities have handed over the case to the detective department of Calcutta Police to probe how the student was able to get the forged marksheet.

 ?From now on, we have to be more careful when we examine the marksheets of students seeking admission in our postgraduate courses,? Ujwal Basu, university registrar, said on Sunday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 No clue yet to identity

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Almost 48-hours after a 20-year-old woman was found murdered on a pavement in Jodhpur Park, police on Monday said she was first beaten with a blunt weapon that broke her left ribs, and then struck with a sharp weapon on her head. Thereafter, she was strangled to death with the gamchha which was left beside the body.

 ?It appears that the body was brought from elsewhere and dumped on the footpath. Possibly, the assassins knew that the place was dark and that not many would venture out there after 11 pm,? said Gyanwant Singh, city detective chief. 

 Police working on the case believe the assassins may have had a good dinner the night before they decided to kill her. 

 With Vishwakarma puja celebrations in full swing, police are not ruling out the possibility of the killers having been drunk. They could have struck the woman?s head with the sharp end of a broken bottle. Police have, however, ruled out the possibility of the woman having been sexually assaulted before her murder.

 On Sunday afternoon, Lake police sent photographs of the woman to all police stations across the city. 

 Since there was no response on Monday from any city police station, a team of officers from Lake police station left for Sonarpur and its adjoining areas in a last-ditch attempt to find out who she was to help solve the case.

 ?Fixing the identity of the victim is most vital before we start an investigation. All that we have been able to establish so far is that she was not a Jodhpur Park resident,? said an officer of Lake thana. 

 The police team will scan ?missing? diaries lodged in all police stations in and around Sonarpur.

 Around 11.30 pm on Saturday, a night guard of the area noticed the woman?s body on the footpath, under a tree.

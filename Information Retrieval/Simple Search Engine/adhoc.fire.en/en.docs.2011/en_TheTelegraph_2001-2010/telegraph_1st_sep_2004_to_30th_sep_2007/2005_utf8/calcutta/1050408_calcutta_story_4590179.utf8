 Children?s little theatre

 Goutam Halder as and in Barda

 Nandikar celebrated World Theatre Day in the last week of March with various events, among them a performance of one of their current productions, Barda. This was an appropriate choice not only because it is the finest solo show in their present repertoire but also because this is the right time of year for a play about annual examinations.

 Swatilekha Sengupta dramatised Barda from Munshi Premchand?s short story Bade Bhai Sahib, structuring it as a television interview of a respectable citizen, conjecturally Premchand himself. This narrator credits his elder brother as the inspiration behind his life, and relates their childhood activities. 

 Barda emerges as a real character: a duffer in school, he was several classes senior to the narrator, but failed so many times that his kid brother caught up with and overtook him. Study as hard as he might, Barda could never tackle exams, whereas his brilliant brother, cowed by the prospect of receiving higher marks, even gave up studies but beat Barda nevertheless. Barda chided him, saying that it took much greater intellectual effort to remain in the same class year after year.

 With poignant humour recalling Tagore and Saratchandra, Premchand proves that academic merit means less than human sensitivity. Barda has a heart of gold, disciplines his sibling as well as flies kites with him, and teaches him more lessons about life, values and ethics than his education does.

 Goutam Halder perfectly expresses the narrator?s nostalgia and affection, the reminiscences bringing tears to his eyes. It is a difficult part to act, since he sits most of the time in one chair. In these circumstances, the live input of the TV camera projecting his face on a large screen provides other angles so that our view does not become monotonous.

 In contrast, Nandikar?s versions of Leela Mazumdar?s children?s stories are less subtle, more direct. In typical large-cast Nandikar style, Andharmani brings dollops of colour to the tale of a boy scared of the dark, who must bring magical honey from a cave to cure his grandfather. Sudipta Kundu?s choreography and Swatilekha Sengupta?s music give vivid dynamics to the stage picture, but ultimately it remains a relatively straightforward narrative.

 Duliya, Mazumdar?s parable about a milkwoman carrying three pitcherfuls for her family, is even more simple to the point of predictability, which always spoils the surprise element in drama. The generous heroine gives all the milk away to hungry children on a train who ask her for it. Despite the altruistic message, Sohini Halder?s one-woman show is handicapped by our early ability to foresee the conclusion.

 Still, Nandikar?s work in children?s theatre remains creditable.

 Jessica Lange: Broadway beckons

 Punartaranga Utsav, a festival of plays conceived by Shaoli Mitra of Pancham Baidik and Suman Mukhopadhyay of Tritiyo Sutra, starts at Uttam Mancha on January 18. 

 The six-day splash will find the two troupes staging most of their old productions. Pancham Baidik takes the stage for Nathaboti Anathbat, Putulkhela, Hajabarolo and Rajnaitik Hotya on January 18, 20, 22 and 23. Tritiyo Sutra will put up Gantobyo, Mephisto, Teestaparer Brittanto and Shomoy Ashomoyer Brittanto on January 19, 21, 22 and 23. 

 Giving the city?s theatre circuit a shot in the arm, cellphone service provider Reliance Infocomm has decided to promote the festival. Reliance India Mobile subscribers across the country will be able to watch and hear video clips of Nathaboti Anathbat and Katha Amrita Samaan, with recitation by Shaoli, and also download wallpapers capturing dramatic moments from Shaoli and Suman?s productions.

 A contest on the festival is also being organised for subscribers. The winners will get free passes to Punartaranga.

 The festival marks a joint effort by Shaoli and Suman to create an interactive theatre experience for both the artistes and the audiences. 

 The two have decided to shun the established theatre stops across town and perform at Uttam Mancha in Hazra.

 ?I need a platform where we can perform on a regular basis. So, the idea is to create a space where people can see good theatre,? Shaoli had said while announcing the festival in November. 

 ?The aim is to decentralise the usual theatre venues and the system of functioning at the auditoriums,? added Suman.

 The two troupes will hold matinee and evening shows at the venue every Sunday from the last week of January. 

Suman and Shaoli: joint effort

Following in the footsteps of Holly Hunter, Kevin 

Spacey and Ethan Hawke, yet another Hollywood star is staging a return to theatre. 

To show her mettle, Jessica Lange has chosen a Broadway revival of Tennessee Williams? 

The Glass Menagerie. 

 The two-time Academy Award-winning actress will be seen in the role of Amanda Wingfield in the production to be directed by David Leveaux. 

 In 1992, Lange starred as Blanche Dubois in yet another Tennessee Williams play, A Streetcar Named Desire, in New York and London. The production featured Alec Baldwin as Stanley Kowalski. Lange?s other critically acclaimed performance was in Eugene O?Neill?s Long Day?s Journey Into Night in the West End. 

 The actress fetched Oscars for her roles in Tootsie and Blue Sky, and nominations for her performances in France, Country, Sweet Dreams and Music Box. 

 The Glass Menagerie premiered on Broadway at Playhouse Theatre in 1945. Williams first tasted success with the play considered one of his masterpieces along with A Streetcar Named Desire and Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. 

 Set in St. Louis of the 1930s, The Glass Menagerie is woven around the Wingfield family, comprising Tom, who is torn between his obligation to his family and his desire to break away, his mother Amanda and his frail sister Laura. The most recent Broadway production of The Glass Menagerie, presented in 1994, starred Calista Flockhart, better known as Ally Mcbeal.

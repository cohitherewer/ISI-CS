The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Hot babe? Not me

 Bhumika Chawla in Dil Jo Bhi Kahey

 Very few people know that the Tere Naam leading lady, also known as Bhumika Chawla, spent two years of her life in Calcutta. ?I was in my eighth standard then and I really loved the place? so chilled out,? she tells Metro. ?So if there?s one person who should be doing Bengali films, it?s me. Not because everyone else is doing it but because I have a connection with the place from much before everyone else!?

 The actress, who shot to fame twisting and twirling her orange odhni in the Salman Khan-starrer, hasn?t had a dream run in tinsel town since, with both Run and Dil Ne Jise Apna Kaha flopping badly and even Silsiilay not working at the box-office. But that hasn?t rattled the demure beauty, now banking on her delightful cameo in Romesh Sharma?s Dil Jo Bhi Kahey.

 ?I am quite happy with the way my career has shaped up and I consider myself blessed to have got the opportunity of working with the best names in the industry. Of course, some films don?t work and there is the disappointment but you have to carry on,? reasons Bhumika.

 Ever since her debut, Bhumika has been branded with an Indian image and despite her playing a glamour queen in Silsiilay, she seems firmly stuck in the desi mould. ?It?s good in a way because there is a dearth of actresses who can play those roles,? she says. ?There are lots of good-looking hot babes around and frankly, I don?t look like one of them. So, I have no qualms in being what I am and even in Silsiilay, it wasn?t any conscious makeover.?

 And so you have Bhumika playing a simple Indian girl again in Dil Jo Bhi Kahey. ?I am playing this medical intern who is based in Mauritius. Of course, there?s a romantic angle with the leading guy Karan (Sharma). And while there is another girl in the film, I feel that you can come into just one scene in a movie and create magic.?

 As with almost all of Bollywood,Bhumika is delighted to have shared the frame with Amitabh Bachchan. ?It was a fabulous experience working with a living legend like Amitji and a veteran actress like Revathy Ma?m. His discipline and her small nuances... it has been a great learning experience.?

 After Dil Jo Bhi Kahey, Bhumika has loads of other releases waiting to hit the halls. ?There?s Raj Kumar Santoshi?s Family where I am cast opposite Akshay Kumar. Then there?s Anees Bazmee?s Benaam where I have been paired with Ajay Devgan. I am also doing the Anil Kapoor production Mahatma Vs Gandhi, which is directed by theatre stalwart Feroze Khan and has Akshaye Khanna opposite me. I even have a film down south with Chiranjeevi,? she reveals.

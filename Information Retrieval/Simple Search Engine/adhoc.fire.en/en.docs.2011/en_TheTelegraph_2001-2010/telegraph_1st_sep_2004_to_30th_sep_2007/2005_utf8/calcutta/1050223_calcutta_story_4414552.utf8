The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 We Ask You Answer

 An extra penny for comfort

 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Today?s question: Should multiplexes charge higher than single-screen cinema halls? More responses will be published next week

 Queue for quality: A multiplex in town 

Sushma Jalan, 

Alipore 

Multiplexes do not provide facilities that would justify 

the kind of prices they charge. Those who have had the misfortune of seating in 

the first few rows of a multiplex theatre would know what I am talking about. 

Moreover, after the multiplex boom, halls like Priya, Paradise and Menoka have 

been wonderfully renovated and are still charging lower rates. In all fairness, 

multiplexes should cut down on ticket prices.

Arpita Chowdhury, 

 East Sinthee Road

If multiplexes can provide us a more comfortable environment 

to watch movies than cinema halls, then there is no harm in multiplex tickets 

being priced higher. But the ticket prices should not be beyond the means of middle-class 

people. 

Ranadip Ganguly, 

 Diamond Park

The reason why people prefer multiplexes to single-screen 

theatres is better infrastructure. It is natural that multiplexes should charge 

higher than single-screen cinemas. 

Piyal Mukherjee, 

 New Alipore

As multiplexes offer more comfort and more options 

to movie-goers, the higher ticket prices are justified.

Pankaj Bhatia

 Loudon Street

I always prefer to spend money in single-screen cinema 

halls. I won?t bother to pay more for comfort.

Diptimoy Ghosh, 

 Salt Lake

The cost of maintenance of multiplexes is much higher 

than that of cinema halls. So, multiplexes can charge higher prices for tickets, 

but if they continue to stick to their exorbitant rates, as they do now, people 

will stop going to cinema halls. 

Arunava Bose Chowdhury, 

 Barrackpore

A lot of cinema lovers are staying away from halls 

because of high ticket prices. With multiplexes replacing cinema halls, video 

piracy will become rampant and the film industry, in general, will suffer. 

Ali Asgar Poonawala,

 Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road

Multiplexes offer digital sound, high quality visuals 

and a host of other services. They have every right to charge higher than other 

movie halls.

Anuj Kumar Ghosh,

 Shyamnagar

Going to theatres is no longer about just watching 

films. Hence, multiplexes have become the ideal destination. If people are willing 

to pay higher prices for tickets, then why not?

Soham Gupta,

 Anil Roy Road

Multiplexes offer better services than single-screen 

halls, but that does not mean that they can charge any price they want. There 

are a few cinema halls which are as comfortable as the multiplexes but charge 

half as much.

Rimli Datta,

 Salt Lake 

Why should the multiplexes charge more? In fact, they 

should charge less as they make more money within a period of time than single-screen 

halls. The extra services that multiplexes provide do not justify the difference 

in ticket prices.

Chameli Pal,

 Batanagar

Multiplexes are not Nandans that will provide movie-viewing 

pleasure to the urban populace for peanuts by taxing marginal landless labourers 

in villages. Unless the multiplexes break even and earn profit, they will close 

down, in the same manner as cinema halls like Tiger and Rupam did. Viewers should 

pay for the wide option they get at multiplexes and also for total viewing experience. 

They can, of course, assert their right not to go to multiplexes if the rates 

seem too high. 

Neha Dokania,

 Bangur Avenue

Definitely. Given the kind of facilities multiplexes 

provide, they should charge higher. We should not forget that multiplexes are 

meant for the urban, upper-class people. 

Hemanta Kumar Dutta,

 Shibpur

It is unacceptable that multiplexes charge a great 

deal higher than single-screen cinema halls. However, I feel that ticket rates 

at multiplexes should be marginally higher than the rates of single-screen cinema 

halls. 

Stobraj Gooptu,

 Gooptu Lane

Multiplexes all over the country charge higher rates 

than single-screen halls. The higher charges of multiplexes are justified for 

what they have to offer. 

Payal Srivastava,

 Howrah

It is fair enough for multiplexes to charge higher 

than single-screen theatres, given the kind of facilities they offer. At least, 

in multiplexes, the audience does not whistle during every scene. 

Prasanta Kumar Ghosh,

 Barasat 

Multiplexes pay taxes at higher rates and offer service 

of a higher quality, so obviously, they will charge more for tickets.

Supriyo Banerjee,

 Dakshineshwar

Multiplexes offer more options than single-screen 

halls and hence charge higher rates. However, I think the ticket prices at multiplexes 

should be reduced so that people from all walks of life can watch movies there.

Sumant Poddar,

 Kyd Street

Multiplexes should definitely charge higher than single-screen 

cinema halls. A person who enjoys the additional services that multiplexes offer 

should be ready to shell out more money for them. 

Jayanta Datta,

 Chinsurah

There are several differences between multiplexes 

and single-screen cinema halls, so it is natural that their ticket rates should 

also be different. It is the duty of the government to verify whether their respective 

ticket prices are justified or not. Multiplexes should not be allowed to charge 

higher unless they provide better services.

Neha Daruka,

 Lake Town

These days, movie-lovers do not mind paying extra 

for greater comfort. In view of that, I don?t see anything wrong in multiplexes 

charging higher for tickets.

Anwesha Sarkar,

 Mysore

Multiplexes should be costlier than single-screen 

cinema hall. The service that they provide warrants higher ticket prices.

Subhobrata Basu,

 Ballygunge

Unlike single-screen theatres, multiplexes provide 

viewers with comfort, a good ambience and hygienic food. So it is quite natural 

that people are making a beeline for the multiplexes even if they have to pay 

higher for the experience. 

Nidhi Poddar,

 Salt Lake

I don?t think multiplexes should be deterred from 

charging higher than single-screen theatres. Traditional cinema halls can use 

lower ticket prices to their advantage and steal a march over the multiplexes.

Joydip Sur,

 CIT Road

The higher ticket prices at the multiplexes are justified 

considering the kind of services they provide. That is the reason multiplexes 

are doing so well in general.

Soumita Mallik,

 Lord Sinha Road

Multiplexes offer a better environment to watch movies 

than single-screen theatres. So higher ticket prices there are justified. 

Arnab Pal,

 Salt Lake

Yes, multiplexes can charge higher than single-screen 

halls as they show movies using cutting-edge projection and sound systems, thus 

providing for a much better experience. But the management of the multiplexes 

should keep the ticket prices within the reach of common people.

Dipro Ray,

 Beniapukur Lane

One of the reasons multiplexes are replacing single-screen 

theatres in the city is that people are becoming more affluent. The owners of 

the multiplexes should make a conscious effort to keep the ticket rates affordable. 

Also, the rates should be uniform for all films. Otherwise it creates utter confusion 

among the viewers.
